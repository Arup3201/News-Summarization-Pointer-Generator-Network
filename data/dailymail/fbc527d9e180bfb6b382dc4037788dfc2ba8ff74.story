A beauty queen who resigned after alleging that the Miss USA pageant had been fixed says she is stunned by a ruling that she must pay the pageant organization $5 million for defamation.

Former Miss Pennsylvania USA Sheena Monnin said that the 'most logical course' would be to contest the arbitrator's ruling but she is considering her options.

Arbitrator Theodore Katz says Monnin's allegations that finalists had been selected in advance were false, harmful and malicious and cost the pageant, owned by billionaire Donald Trump, a $5 million fee from a potential 2013 sponsor.

Monnin points to a Miss USA contract 
clause giving top pageant officials the power to pick the top five 
finalists and the winner, but a company official calls that a catch-all 
that's never been used.

Earlier this month, Donald Trump was victorious in a lawsuit he filed against
Monnin, who called the Miss USA pageant 'fixed' and 'trashy' after she 
failed to make the semifinals of the beauty contest this summer.

The eventual winner of Miss USA, Olivia Culpo,
beat 88 other beauty queens on December 20 to take the Miss Universe 
title from Leila Lopes of Angola at the Planet Hollywood casino in Las 
Vegas.

Mr Trump, co-owner of the Miss Universe Organization, sued Monnin for defamation after  she alleged in June that a fellow contestant
in the competition had seen a list of the top five winners before the 
finalists were named on stage.

A U.S. District Court Magistrate ruled in favor of the Miss Universe Organization, awarding it $5 million in damages and stated Monnin's statements 'showed a reckless disregard'.

Miss Pennsylvania's Sheena Monnin accused Miss Universe Organization of rigging the competition when
she resigned from her position in mid June.

She claimed Karina Brez, who was representing Florida at the contest in Las Vegas, Nevada on June 3, recited the top five women after seeing a list of their names backstage.

In a Facebook post announcing her 
resignation, she wrote: 'Apparently the morning of June 3rd [Brez] saw a
folder lying open to a page that said 'FINAL SHOW Telecast, June 3, 
2012' and she saw the places for Top 5 already filled in.

'After
the Top 16 were called and we were standing backstage she hesitantly 
said to me and another contestant that she knew who the Top 5 were. I 
said 'who do you think they will be?' She said that she didn't 'think' 
she 'knew' because she saw the list that morning.

'She
relayed whose names were on the list. Then we agreed to wait and see if
that was indeed the Top 5 called that night. After it was indeed the 
Top 5 I knew the show must be rigged.'

Miss
Universe Organization vehemently denied the claims and said that Monnin
had cited the new rules allowing transgender contestants as her reason 
for resigning.

Donald Trump
also denied the claims and proceeded with the lawsuit against Monnin, who he believed 
was suffering 'loser's remorse'.

Top five: Monnin claims another contestant told her Miss Ohio, Miss Maryland, Miss Rhode Island, Miss Nevada and Miss Georgia would be the top five before they were even read out

'I did see her for about a second. I 
never felt that she had a chance,' he told the Today show over the summer.

'I know what I heard, and I know what I in turn witnessed... so I’m prepared to continue to march forward,' Monnin responded on Today.

'I
feel an injustice has been done, not only to the other people who were 
not in the top five, but to the thousands of pageant girls across the 
country who competed, believing this is an honest system.'

But Brez has also come forward to deny she made the claims seriously.

'Backstage
during the pageant, I did see a piece of paper with names on it and 
like most people in such frenetic circumstances, joked that they must be
the names of the final contestants,' Brez said.

'It
was a throwaway comment, in the stress of the pageant, and was never 
meant as fact. The list I saw didn’t even have the eventual winner on 
it.'

Monnin told Today she believes Brez changed her story out of fear.

'She looked a little bit scared because 
she had just seen something that would potentially, drastically change 
the reputation of the Miss Universe Organization,' she said. 'This is a big deal.'

The latest accuser, who was not identified, said Miss Brez had appeared 'very, very flustered and upset' as the top 15 girls were announced.

'I thought it might be because she 
didn’t make the top 15 cut, but at that point she was able to reveal to 
me at least four of the five names who went on to be the top girls,' the
contestant told FOX News.

'She couldn’t remember the fifth 
because she was so upset. Several of the girls then started hearing 
through the grapevine about a list; a lot of people were upset.'

'A lot of the girls now are very upset 
about how Pennsylvania is being treated and aggressively attacked by an 
organization that claims to empower women,' she said.

Top
ten: Monnin said the contestant told her about the discovery as the top
16 were announced. But organizers have said she resigned because she 
was against the new rule allowing transgender contestants

The top 15 girls are decided by preliminary judging in the days before the broadcast, and fan voting determines the 16th. The top ten, top five and winner are decided in the live show, a rep said.

The scores for the competition are believed to be entered into a computer system as the show is live. These results are monitored and verified by Ernst & Young.

'In accordance with the rules of the competition, Ernst & Young's tabulation of the judges' votes which determined the final five contestants did not occur until after the evening gown competition had been completed,' a representative said.

Judge Joe Jonas tweeted after the accusations: 'All I can say... Is the Miss USA competition was NOT rigged. Miss [Rhode Island] USA won fair and square.'

The pageant named Ms Culpo, a 20-year-old cellist, the winner after she made it clear that she embraced all beauty queens - transgender or otherwise - during the interview portion.

In the dreaded final question round, Ms 
Culpo was faced with the most difficult question of the night: Would it 
be fair for a person born a man to be named Miss Universe after becoming
a woman?

Ms Culpo never stumbled as she embraced the Miss Universe Organization's recent decision to admit transgender contestants.

'I do think that would be fair,' she said. 'But I could understand how people could be apprehensive to take that road.'

It is an opinion that Monnin does not share. In her resignation email, she wrote: 'I refuse to be part of a pageant system that has so far and so completely removed itself from its foundational principles as to allow and support natural born males to compete in it.

'This goes against ever moral fiber of my being.  I believe in integrity, high moral character, and fair play, none of which are part of this system any longer.'
