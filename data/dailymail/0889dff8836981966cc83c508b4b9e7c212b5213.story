A Georgia man has been ordered to pay his former fiance $50,000 for 'breach of promise' and fraud after he left her for another woman.

Melissa Cooper successfully sued her former lover Christopher Kelley after she gave up her job and moved in with him only to be thrown out when she discovered his relationship with another woman. 

Ms Cooper contended in her lawsuit that she
 quit her job to become a housewife for her former beau, their child and 
another child he had from a former relationship. She made that sacrifice
 under the premise she would be his wife.

She won the lawsuit: Melissa Cooper has been awarded $50,000 by a Georgia court

‘Cooper testified that she was devastated by Kelley's fraud and breach of promise to marry and that she quit her job to raise the couple's children in reliance on the promise,’ the ruling cited by CNS said.

Her promiscuous partner made his bed by cheating on her multiple times and carrying on a relationship with another woman despite handing her a $10,000 engagement ring, she argued.

In 2011, she discovered the secret affair, the second she had found during their relationship, and he demanded she move out of their home – with both children.

Pay up: Christopher Kelley unsuccessfully tried to argue his relationship with Ms Cooper was similar to prostitution

The scorned would-be spouse then sued the cheating Mr Cooper for fraud and breach of promise to marry.

In the state's Appeals Court last month, 
Mr Kelley unsuccessfully tried to use a legal techincality to argue that
 the promise to marry was made in a relationship similar to 
prostitution, according to CNS.

The state court of appeals ruled that the relationship did not involve the exchange of money for cohabitation and sexual favors, making the defense inapplicable.

Mr Kelley also tried to claim he merely gave Ms Cooper the ring without proposing, but the court not only shot that down, it held it up as proof he never intended to marry her.

‘I never initiated the concept of marriage with her, outside of giving her that ring,’ Mr Kelley testified, according to CNS. ‘I never said the words 'will you marry me' to her.’

‘This testimony, when juxtaposed with Cooper's testimony about the proposal and her acceptance, can be construed as an admission that Kelley never intended to marry Cooper,’ said the court decision.

The latest ruling upheld a previous ruling being appealed by Mr Kelley, it includes damages awarded and attorney’s fees.
