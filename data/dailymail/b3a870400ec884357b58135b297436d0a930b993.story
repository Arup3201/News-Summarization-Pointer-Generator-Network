Somewhere buried on the camera roll of his iPhone is a photograph Ed Woodward took of the scoreboard as Manchester United lost 2-0 at Olympiakos in the Champions League last season. Caught in the act at the Karaiskakis Stadium, the United chief executive, arm outstretched, looked a little like a fan, a tourist.

Woodward, though, took that photograph for a reason.

That was the night he and fellow members of the United board realised that manager David Moyes was not the man for them anymore, a night when Woodward saw players simply going through the motions, lying down in surrender to perhaps the worst team left in the competition.

Fresh ideas: Louis van Gaal has an 'aura' about him and is the right man for United, says Ed Woodward

As such, he took the photograph as a 
personal reminder of how bad things were, as something to look back on 
when things got better.

Ahead
 of Louis van Gaal’s first game as United manager at the Pasadena Rose 
Bowl tonight, Woodward is now convinced things are about to get 
significantly better.

'As I look back, I just feel a lot more positivity in terms of this coming season,' said Woodward last night.

'Part of that is simply because of what Louis did at the World Cup.

'It's given us a bit of an aura again.

'He's impressed everyone around the club since he started.

'There's a real positive energy and buzz around the place.'

If
 last season was bad for Moyes and United – who finished seventh in the 
Barclays Premier League – then it wasn’t great for Woodward either.

Perceived
 by many as a novice chief executive unable to get things done in the 
transfer market last summer, Woodward was lampooned on social media and 
criticised heavily in the mainstream.

If
 Moyes functioned last season in the shadow of predecessor Sir Alex 
Ferguson then perhaps Woodward suffered by comparison to his own, David 
Gill, and the 42-year-old admits that his own search for credibility 
goes on.

'It was a challenging year,' he said, with some understatement.

'In an ideal situation, I would have worked with Alex for a year. I would love to have done it personally.

'Most
 of the job wasn't a surprise. I've been at the club nine years. But I 
can’t say I walked in last season and knew everything because I didn’t.

'You gain credibility through experience, through time. You can't expect it from day one and I wouldn't ask that of the fans.

'Look, criticism comes with the job and when you have got long term plans, you can't be distracted by short-term problems.

'You
 do keep learning on the job and that will continue but I don't mind 
reading about these kind of comments because I think it's extremely 
important for me to listen to the fans.'

Speaking
 at United’s team hotel in Beverley Hills this week, Woodward delayed a 
flight back to England in order to honour media promises. To him, 
perception is important, not due to personal vanity but because he 
recognised early on that – results apart – United’s public image has not
 always been great.

Early 
indications are that Van Gaal – whose team face LA Galaxy today – has 
done his own bit to lift spirits inside Old Trafford. There may have  
been some criticism of United’s training ground – work began on 
rectifying that yesterday morning – and a nod towards top heavy 
commercial obligations, but club staff are already talking about a coach
 clearly energised – rather than awed – by the challenge.

'We are a different sized club to anyone else,' said Woodward.

'Almost
 at anywhere else you have been you have not experienced what being a 
Manchester United manager is until you have been Manchester United 
manager.

'But Louis is clearly excited by it.

'I
 think he was one of the managers at the World Cup who was proactive, he
 did more things in games, and that gave him a bigger profile.

'That all helps and works for us.'

Woodward’s
 message about transfer spending is already out there. If van Gaal wants
 money he can have pretty much as much as he likes. Woodward wouldn’t be
 drawn in to talk of smashing transfer records – he has learned to spot 
imminent headlines – but was happy to point out that last week’s new kit
 deal – cut with Adidas to the tune of £750m – indicates the club’s 
ongoing muscle and status.

'As
 Louis said very eloquently, seventh last year isn’t the biggest but 
what the deal shows and what we’re seeing with everything we’re doing 
from a commercial perspective, talking to agents, talking from a 
player’s perspective about wanting to come to us, we are the biggest 
club in the world, there’s no question in my mind about that,' he said.

'The reality is that we're not afraid of spending significant amounts of money in the transfer market.

'Whether it's a record or not doesn't really resonate with us.

'There is no budget. We are in a very strong financial position. We can make big signings.'
