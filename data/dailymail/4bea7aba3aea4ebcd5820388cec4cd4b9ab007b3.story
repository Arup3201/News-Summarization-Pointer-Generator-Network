Saracens responded to Harlequins’ verbal jabs with a knockout victory at The Stoop orchestrated by Charlie Hodgson.

Quins England duo Mike Brown and Joe Marler had taunted their opponents in the build-up to the London derby but their sabre rattling counted for nothing as they were easily outmuscled on their home patch.

And after a three-try mauling, it is Saracens who can continue to claim to be the capital’s top club, having won 11 of the last 12 meetings between the rivals. As an early-season test, one that leaves their title credentials looking seriously weak.

What had the makings of an explosive contest started with some scrappy exchanges. England backs coach Andy Farrell was watching and he would have been unimpressed when Chris Robshaw clumsily knocked on shortly after kick-off. Then Brown was beaten to a high ball inside his own 22 and — in spite of a bone crunching tackle from Kyle Sinckler on Chris Ashton — Quins were coming off second best in most contests.

Marler and his pack struggled to make themselves felt in the scrum, while Saracens’ England contingent, particularly full back Alex Goode, all thrived off front-foot ball.

Hodgson slotted an 11th-minute penalty and Saracens almost grabbed the opening try nine minutes later, only to be denied by a remarkable tackle from Brown. Duncan Taylor had the line at his mercy, but the Quins full-back intervened to spectacularly dislodge the ball from under the centre’s arm.

Owen Farrell was once again on the Saracens bench but former England fly-half Hodgson, 33, continued to show why he has been entrusted with the starting jersey with another penalty to double the advantage.

He then charged down a clearance kick from Nick Evans to finish under the posts, before adding a third penalty to put Saracens 16-0 up at half time.

Hodgson was shown a yellow card for a deliberate knock-on early in the second half but Ben Botica was unable to capitalise, striking the resulting penalty against the post. Quins were unable to make use of their one-man advantage and instead, with Hodgson still in the sin-bin, Sarries extended their lead with a penalty from Goode.

The pre-match spice resurfaced when Saracens skipper Alistair Hargreaves was shown a yellow card after a mass outbreak of handbags and he was joined shortly after by Quins replacement prop Rob Buchanan.

Hodgson added two more penalties either side of Buchanan’s yellow card, Ashton touched down in the 70th minute and Will Fraser went over to complete the rout.
