Although Stoke City have twice failed to obtain a work permit for the former New York Red Bulls forward, Wolves boss Kenny Jackett doesn't forsee any problems.

Jackett told the Birmingham Mail: 'He's over here full stop. He is not waiting to go back over to the States. He's looking to break into English football. He's put no time frame on it. He's very keen to get into English football.

'I don't think the work permit is an issue. Everything looks okay. We haven't applied for one because we haven't decided to sign him yet but the enquiries that we have made so far are that everything will be fine if we want to take him.

'He's 21 so if we do take him we'll be looking to make him a first team striker. He's very strong and a good finisher. My first impressions in training are that he looks quite mobile.
