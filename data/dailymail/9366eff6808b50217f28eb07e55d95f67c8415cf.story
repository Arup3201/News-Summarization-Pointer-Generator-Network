Roy Hodgson gave a nod of admiration. He liked this line of enquiry, which had turned the spotlight nicely onto Vauxhall, England’s sponsors and hosts for the World Cup squad announcement.

So Roy, is your England team a family saloon or a sports car? 'Very good question,' he chortled. 'I don’t know if I’m clever enough to answer. All I’ll say is this… I’ll allow you to decide if it’s a family saloon or a sports car. I’m happy to drive it.'

Nice reponse, it was agreed and the nod of admiration was duly returned.

At the wheel: Roy Hodgson arrives for the England World Cup Squad announcement at Vauxhall HQ

No alarms and no surprises: Hodgson's England squad was predictable but received well 

Holding court: The England boss delivers his announcement in a room packed with journalists

Life through a lens: Hodgson was well prepared and calm for his squad announcement on Monday

A titter of approval rippled around the cramped and airless conference room inside the Vauxhall car plant in Luton chosen by the Football Association for this grand revelation.

The England boss may be of mature years but he remains of nimble mind, even if it does not always seem that way when he is on the touchline, scratching his head and dithering over which of his many substitutes to deploy.

Clearly, he had not been up all night crunching the final names on his 23-man list or worrying that Ashley Cole might be reaching for the air-gun and plotting his revenge.

In fact, Hodgson made it seem like he could have announced this squad weeks ago. He was merely waiting for the troublesome Barclays Premier League season to grind to an end before he pulled on his driving gloves, turned the key and set the Sat Nav.

It must be in the blood. The son of a Croydon bus driver is behind the wheel. All aboard, ding-ding, Mr Roy reaches up and rolls over the destination board until it reads: 'Rio de Janiero'.

Out with the old: Ashley Cole has retired from international football after his exclusion from the squad

And in with the new: Southampton's exciting teenager left back Luke Shaw has won a seat on the plane 

The next time Vauxhall appeared in a question, it was not quite such a complimentary context.

Aren’t England just a bit too much like Vauxhall, quite reliable but ordinary?

Ouch. The room winced. No sweat for Hodgson though. He is a well-read man of words, in his element when the nation hangs on his every word.

After threatening to summon the man from Vauxhall to defend his honour, the England boss rolled into a statistical defence on his two years at the helm.

'We don’t lose often,' he said. 'I’ve had three defeats in 25 games, all in friendly matches, when I’ve made a lot of experiments.'

Hodgson was in his groove by this point. His 23 names had not caused a stir. After his decision to omit 107-cap Cole in favour of one-cap teenager Luke Shaw had leaked out the night before, the heat was off.

He arrived late – not a great advert for Vauxhall or the massive watch on his left wrist for that matter.

The past was yours but the future's mine: Michael Carrick is on stand-by but Ross Barkley is in the squad

Confirmation of the 23-man squad and the seven on stand-by released online by the FA had beaten him into the room by a good 15 minutes and it was to be as had been expected.

'It’s a big day,' said Hodgson when he got around to it. He is an Englishman who is genuinely proud to be driving this particular bus, or family saloon, or…. Anyway.

He has taken the Swiss to football’s biggest tournament and here he is about to lead England to Brazil. After the cold calculation of Fabio Capello and Sven Goran Eriksson, it is reassuring to know there is a little national pride behind this World Cup caper.

England are going to the World Cup with plans to win it, he explained, but if they come home with nothing more than added experience then so be it. They would be all the better for Euro 2016 in France.

Hodgson’s team is evolving fast, and it enjoys a spirit of adventure with 11 from Liverpool, Everton and Southampton – three teams who have been committed to fast and exciting football in the last nine months.

Simply by selecting Luke Shaw ahead of Cole, Ross Barkley ahead of Michael Carrick and Raheem Sterling at the expense of Ashley Young, this squad feels a little more fresh and exciting.

At this stage, only six of those who started against Italy in the Euro 2012 quarter-finals in Kiev are on the plane. Only seven of the 17 who appeared in Hodgson’s first game, a friendly in Norway nearly two years ago, are on the plane.

Or lining up for a go in Roy’s sports car.
