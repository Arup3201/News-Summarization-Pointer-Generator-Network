A policewoman has died following a mystery illness only four weeks after her baby girl was born. 

Officer Becci Dadswell, 35, was spending time with her newborn baby Isabella when she suddenly suffered acute pains.

She died two and a half hours later in hospital.

The former nurse had given birth to her first child, baby girl Isabella, only four weeks before her death

Husband Simon paid tribute saying 'she was an amazing woman, the kindest you could ever meet'

She had given birth to her first child in December and there were no signs of any infection of problems. 

Tonight, her husband Simon, 39, told MailOnline: 'It's devastating. It's terrible. She was an amazing woman, the kindest you could ever meet. 

'She was a caring person, gentle and bubbly. Words can't do it justice.

'She was a very pretty, beautiful person. She was like a Disney princess in her attitude to life.'

He added: 'It was hard because she really wanted a baby and she got her wish.

'I knew she would be a fantastic mother because she used to be a nurse and was very caring.' 

Speaking about the day itself, he told MailOnline: 'I was in the house with her when she collapsed and I went in the back of the ambulance with her. 

'I'm glad I was there but it's just a desperate situation when the person you love drops in front of you. I thought she had fainted, but then realised it was much more serious.

'It's hard to understand why it happened but it doesn't matter one way or the other because it isn't going to bring her back.'

Married to Simon in 2013, Mrs Dadswell was also a mother to step-children Lydia, 14, and Daisy, 13. 

Her family said she was desperate to become a mother and her death had left them 'shocked' 

Mrs Dadswell suffered acute pains at around 12.30pm on January 5 and died shortly after at Whiston Hospital near Liverpool.

It is not clear what caused the young mother's death. 

Her parents, Alan and Denise Butler, spoke of their heartbreak at her loss.

Mr Butler said: 'You could see the love between Becci and Bella.

'She would hold her in her arms and look at her as if she couldn't believe she had given birth to her.

'We had a lovely family Christmas and New Year before it all went wrong. 

'She saw the best in people. Where others would lose patience, she'd give them the benefit of the doubt.' 

Mrs Butler added: 'She was so excited to be a mum, a loving, caring girl who called me every day.' 

Mrs Dadswell studied nursing at university in Southampton, and was known for her wonderful bedside manner and care of patients when working at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport. 

She worked part time in hospitals to fund her studies, and her father believes it was her desire to help people that saw her join Cheshire Police in 2007. 

She served with Warrington Central Neighbourhood Policing Unit in Orford, Bewsey and Longford, Cheshire.

Mr Dadswell said 'I knew she would be a fantastic mother because she used to be a nurse and was so caring'

Brother Ben Butler, who is also expecting a child and said the siblings had looked forward to parenthood together, added: 'The whole family is mystified by the causes and shocked.

'As my wife and I became pregnant just a month after my sister, my parents were euphoric about two new grand daughters. Now they have lost a daughter.

'She was one of the kindest souls you could ever meet. As a child she was an aspiring singer and dancer, and started to have some success.

'But one day she had a life epiphany and wanted to contribute to society in a meaningful way.

'She spent time working as a nurse and then surprised us all by becoming a police officer.

'Since her passing the outpouring of grief has been phenomenal - nearly 50,000 people have viewed a tribute video to her on Facebook - and the stories of her kindness have flooded in.

'As a police officer she was known to have consoled both the victims of crime and hugged prisoners, take homeless people for walks and always show compassion to those around her.' 

A fundraising page has now been set up by friend Louise Shaw for Isabella, following her mother's death

Friend Louise Shaw has now set up a trust fund for Isabella, so the baby's future will be provided for - to donate visit http://gogetfunding.com/project/becci-dadswell.

So far the site has raised £6,400 in donations.

Ms Shaw said: 'We have set up this page on behalf of all her family and close friends and work colleagues who knew and loved her so well in support of her husband Si and new born daughter Bella Rose Becci Dadswell.

'Many of you have asked how you can pay tribute to Becci in supporting her new family and their future and the overwhelming suggestion was to provide for Bella's future, in particular her education.

'Becci's little world was complete when Bella was born less than a month ago.

'She left this world having her Daddy walk her up the aisle, marrying 'the one' and being the best step-mum to Lydia and Daisy and finally experiencing motherhood for herself. Albeit for not very long.'  

A memorial service will take place in Romsey, Hampshire, Mrs Dadswell's home town, on Friday.

Well-wishers are welcome at Romsey Abbey with the service due to start at noon.
