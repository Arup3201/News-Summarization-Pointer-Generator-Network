Pictures have emerged of American pop star Redfoo being smashed in the head by a glass bottle and hotel security guards trying to restrain the bleeding singer.

Police charged a 21-year-old man over the attack on the American music star at the Golden Sheaf Hotel in Double Bay in Sydney's inner east around 12:45am on Thursday morning.

The X Factor judge said he was dancing with some girls in the roped-off VIP section of the pub when a 'dodgy' guy threw a glass, cutting him on the head.

'It was shocking to me, when something like that happens,' Redfoo, 38, told Daily Mail Australia. 'There was quite a bit of blood.'

All smiles: The American pop star waved to the media in the early hours of this morning.  

Redfoo posed with police officers and danced along with Golden Sheaf patrons prior to his glassing.

'My hand was all bloody, I looked in the mirror, the whole side of my face had blood on it.'

His alleged attacker - who Redfoo labelled a 'real glasshole' in one interview - attempted to flee the scene.

The injured American singer, whose real name is Stefan Kendal Gordy, sprinted after him but was restrained by security guards and one of his friends.

Redfoo said: 'I have no clue on why you could do such a thing, I can only think of the word jealousy.'

'It's one of the big questions I have. Why, why would he do that? Why would somebody throw a glass at somebody?'

The alleged attacker was apprehended by bar staff and arrested by police.

Redfoo demanded to see him and later told Channel Seven he was stunned by the man's apparent reaction.

'What shocked me the most was (how he reacted) when he saw me look at him,' Redfoo said.

'He looked at me and taunted me and blew a kiss at me and winked his eye.'

Redfoo was allegedly glassed about 12.45am at the Golden Sheaf Hotel in Double Bay in Sydney's inner east.

Redfoo was quick to respond to the incident on Twitter, writing at 1.42am: 'Jealousy is a hell of a drug!'

TV star and singer Redfoo suffered injuries to his face following an alleged glassing incident at Double Bay's Golden Sheaf Hotel in late August

The singer was treated for a small, centimetre-wide cut on the right side of his head and delivered a statement to police.

Redfoo has never been attacked before. It was the first time he had visited the Sydney hotel and he said if he returns he would wear a Ducati motorcycle helmet.

'They gotta' get rid of the glass cups, the glass bottles,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'It's just unnecessary in the club and it's very dangerous.'

'I don't do shows unless there's everything plastic in the clubs and the shows.

'It's something that now I will have to check before I go out anywhere. "What is their policy on glass"?'

The managers of the Golden Sheaf Hotel said in a statement they were  'appalled' by the attack and was assisting authorities with their investigations.

'This behaviour is not tolerated,' they said. 'We are in discussions with Redfoo and his management and we’re glad that he is ok.'

In an interview with Triple M, pubgoer Josh Allerton recalled the chaotic scenes.

'(Redfoo) went down in pain, all of a sudden it just unfolds.'

'He starts sprinting after the guy who gets caught by security... Blood starts coming from his head and we realised it was a bottle being thrown.'

Golden Sheaf customer Erik Bonetti also recounted the dramatic events on Twitter. 'Just saw @RedFoo getting taken out of the Golden Sheaf bleeding from the head,' he tweeted.

'What the hell just happened?'

A police report released on Thursday morning stated that a man approached 'a 39-year-old' in the hotel before 'allegedly throwing a glass at him'.
