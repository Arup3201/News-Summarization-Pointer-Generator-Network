A hyped up kangaroo in China has been caught on camera getting involved in a heated brawl with a toy crocodile, before setting his eyes on an innocent lemur. 

The video shows the kangaroo, which has been dubbed 'kick-a-roo' by Facebook users, becoming increasingly agitated with a cuddly toy, which appears to be hanging from a tree.

After beating the toy to a pulp, the feisty roo then turns on an innocent lemur standing by, who bears the brunt of his anger.

A hyped up Kangaroo in China has been caught on camera getting involved in a heated brawl with a toy crocodile, before setting his eyes on an innocent lemur

A dog, a lemur, the kangaroo and the cuddly toy appear to be enclosed in a caged area in the video, along with a number of other animals

While the dog decided to leave the pumped up kangaroo to his games, the lemur was less than happy with the kangaroo's actions and stayed around to watch the show.

However, the lemur seemed to have had enough of the show after his beloved cuddly toy took a beating.

The brave lemur ventured out into the middle of the play area to confront the kangaroo, with disastrous consequences.

Tugging on the kangaroo's tail, the lone lemur seemed to have bitten off more than he could chew, as the kangaroo pushed him away with one swift kick.

Hitting the kangaroo on the back, the lemur looked like he was ready for a fight, until the kangaroo turned around and looked him square in the eyes.

Cementing his status as the king of the enclosure, the angry kangaroo then turned his sights on the lemur, unimpressed with the animal's attempt to put a stop to his fun.

The lemur appears to immediately regret his decision to take on the mammoth animal, sitting on the ground and wagging his tail in front of him in a defensive manner. 

However, as strong as the kangaroo may be, he can't outrun the lemur and the two end their brawl in a quick chase.

The video has amounted a massive 20,000 shares in the five days it has been on Facebook. 

However, some users have been left outraged at the appalling conditions in which the animals are kept. 

Many have pointed to the fact that the highly active animals are caged together and should have their own space.

'If in Australia, RSPCA would love to talk to the owner. Poor animals they're so stressed,' he said.
