Arsenal's chances of landing Lucas Silva in January could be resurrected after Carlo Ancelotti admitted Real Madrid had still not decided if they should meet Cruzeiro's asking price or not.

The 21-year-old favours a move to the Spanish capital but his club want a quick sale and if Arsenal are willing to meet the £12million valuation when the winter transfer window opens they favour sending him to London.

Ahead of Real Madrid's Friday night game against Almeria before they fly to Morocco for the World Club Championship Ancelotti was asked about the possibility of signing Silva in January and said: 'We are waiting to see how the recovery of Modric and James [Rodriguez] progresses.'

Real Madrid are unsure whether they are willing to pay Cruzeiro's asking price for Lucas Silva 

Arsene Wenger is keen on bringing the 21-year-old midfielder to the Emirates Stadium

The former has a thigh injury and is not expected to be back before March and Rodriguez has a calf problem but may still return for the final of the World Club Championship if Madrid reach it. 'We will not decide anything until the new year,' said Ancelotti.

Silva is part-owned by a sports investment fund who would be owed around £4m from any £12m sale. 

Cruzeiro officials are expected to hold talks with Madrid officials in the next couple of days in Belo Horizonte and if the Spanish club fail to meet the asking price Arsenal will be favourites for his signature.

Cruzeiro have just won the league in Brazil and Silva's consistent displays throughout the season were important in that success. He was named in the league's team of the season at the end of the campaign.
