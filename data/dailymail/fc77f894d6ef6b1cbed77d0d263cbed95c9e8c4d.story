A man who allegedly stabbed teenage twins leaving one 'millimetres from death' is being hunted by police today.

The suspect, who is described as  between 20 and 30-years-old, is accused of attacking the 16-year-old brothers with a 'very sharp blade' following a party in Dilton Marsh, near Westbury in Wiltshire, last night.

One of the boys remains in a serious but stable condition in Southmead Hospital in Bristol after the knife slashed his chest, only narrowly missing his heart.

The other teenager suffered cuts to his hands and has since been discharged from hospital.

Detective Inspector Paul Franklin, of Wiltshire Police, said the suspect approached the twins, who were part of a group which had gathered at a roundabout in the village following a party, before threatening them.

Some members of the group then chased the attacker, who police believe was unknown to the teenagers.

Mr Franklin said: 'We've been told that an unknown man approached the group on the roundabout and threatened them. 

'He was chased by several of the teenagers but produced a knife.

'One of the brothers was slashed across the chest and is lucky to be alive because the knife wound was so deep it was close to his heart. He was just a couple of millimetres from death.

'The other brother received cuts to his hands and was treated in hospital in Trowbridge and discharged.

'This was an extremely serious assault with a very sharp blade.'

The twins were among a group of young people who had gathered at the Dilton Marsh roundabout following a party in the village.

A footpath along the main road near the roundabout was sealed off today as officers continued to search for the knife used in the assault.

One of the teenage boys remains in a serious but stable condition following the attack in the rural village (pictured) last night. Police are hunting the knifeman and believe he may have suffered facial injuries

Police said the suspect fled the scene following the attack and remains at large.

He is described as being 5ft 8in to 5ft 9in tall, with 'shortish' black hair, and was wearing a blue jacket and either blue jeans or grey jogging bottoms.

Officers believe it was likely that he was bleeding from a facial injury which he suffered during the fight and urged any witnesses to come forward.

Mr Franklin said: 'I urgently need to hear from anyone who was at the party or who witnessed what happened around Tanyard Way between 11pm and midnight on Saturday.'

Anyone with information should contact police on 101.
