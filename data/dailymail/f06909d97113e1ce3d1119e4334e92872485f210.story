Nicolas Sarkozy's phone has been tapped for the past year by order of a judge investigating allegations that the former French President's 2007 election campaign was funded by Colonel Gaddafi, it has been claimed.

The Le Monde newspaper reports that the judge took the unprecedented decision to bug Sarkozy's phone, as well as those of as two former interior ministers, following claims he had received £40million from the then Libyan leader.

And the paper, which said the revelations 'have all the ingredients of a state scandal', claims that transcripts of recorded phone conversations have revealed evidence Sarkozy had tampered with the justice system.

Le Monde claims transcriptions of the calls showed Sarkozy and his lawyer were being fed information about internal judicial deliberations by a senior prosecutor at the appeals court described as a 'veteran supporter' of the political right.

The newspaper reports that Sarkozy tried to reward the prosecutor with an official post in Monaco.

Sarkozy's lawyer Thierry Herzog, said the revelations amounted to a 'monstrous' violation of his client's legal rights.

Mr Herzog, said his client 'is probably still being tapped' and denounced what he described as a politically motivated plot against him.

He told AFP news agency: 'There was no attempt to pervert the course of justice and in due course this monstrous violation will be shown to have been a political affair.'

Sarkozy is said to have become aware that his phone was being tapped and that both he and Mr Herzog obtained second mobile phones which they used to communicate with each other.

It comes just a week after clandestine 
recordings of conversations between Sarkozy and his wife Carla Bruni 
were leaked to a French magazine.

Sarkozy is widely expected to contest the 2017 presidential election but he has been dogged by corruption scandals following his defeat by Francois Hollande two years ago.

In October last year he was cleared of corruption charges over allegatuions he had accepting brown envelopes stuffed with cash from Liliane Bettencourt, the l'Oreal heiress, for the 2007.
