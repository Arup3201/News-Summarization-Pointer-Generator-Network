A senior NHS manger has received 
almost £1 million in compensation for racial discrimination and unfair 
dismissal after he was subjected to a 'breathtaking and callous' campaign of bullying 
and harassment from colleagues.

Elliot Browne, one of only a few 
black senior managers in the NHS, was awarded a settlement of ££933,000
by an industrial tribunal - one of the highest payouts awarded for 
racial discrimination at work.

A union official described Mr Browne's abuse as 'breathtaking and callous' and said he had never in his career seen such 'systematic intimidation and bullying of a single individual'.

'Breathtaking and callous': The Central Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust was urged to tackle a 'culture of institutionalised racism'. However the trust said it strongly believed that discrimination did not feature in Mr Browne's case

Mr Browne's 34-year career it the NHS
came to an end when he lost his job as a trust director in 2008 for the
Central Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust.

An employment tribunal in Manchester 
ruled the 55-year-old was subjected to 'discriminatory treatment from 
2007 onwards', when he was repeatedly singled out and accused of 
departmental overspending while other white directors escaped reprimand 
for the same thing.

The tribunal also heard that Mr 
Browne claimed he has been harassed and verbally bullied because he was 
black and was the only black director in the trust.

The judge was told he was subjected to consistent abuse over a period of more than a year.

Singled out: The hearing heard how the claimant (not pictured) became depressed, took time off work and needed psychiatric help

Mr Browne, an Afro-Caribbean grandfather-of-one, 
had left school at the age of 16 and had worked his way up the NHS 
career ladder from a junior lab technician to top managerial roles.

The hearing was told how he was 
accused of allowing his clinical services division to consistently 
overspend, even though the tribunal ruled they were only relatively 
small amounts compared to the total budget size.

He
alleged that he was discriminated against over his department’s 
overspending because he was black and that white directors had not been 
reprimanded over their overspends.

Mr Browne, who earned a management 
degree while working for the NHS, was threatened with disciplinary 
action and then dismissed from his £80,000-a-year job.

The full hearing of the case, which 
was held last year, heard how Mr Browne became depressed, took time off 
work and needed psychiatric help.

The judge was also told he was so unwell that he was unable to enjoy the birth of his oldest child's baby.

Unite, Mr Browne’s union, called for the trust ‘to tackle its culture of institutionalised racism’.

The tribunal awarded Mr Browne, whose health was ‘severely affected’ by his treatment in the workplace, a total of £933,115 for unfair dismissal, aggravated damages, and loss of earnings and pension. He had already received £71,415 from the trust.

Speaking through his union Mr Browne - a former director at the trust -  said: 'It is scandalous that this kind of behaviour and culture should exist in an organisation whose prime purpose is to care for others.'

'The systematic intimidation and bullying of a single individual was breathtaking and callous'

A spokesman for the union added that Mr Browne did not wish to say any more on the matter.

But Unite’s head of health Rachael 
Maskell said: ‘Unfortunately, the case of Elliot Browne is not unique 
within the NHS. Discrimination and harassment in the health service is 
all too common from our experience as a trade union and needs to be 
rooted out.

'NHS employers need to establish 
comprehensive and effective training programmes and human resources’ 
functions so that there will be no repetition of this case. Dignity at 
work needs to be a reality.'

Unite
regional officer Keith Hutson said: ‘This is a well deserved outcome 
for Elliot Browne. It reflects the pain, suffering and grief that he was
put through by his employer, Central Manchester University Hospital NHS
Foundation Trust.

'Hopefully this will act as a catalyst for his former employer to face up to their obligations in tackling the culture of institutionalised racism that they seem happy to endorse and that is underpinned by a cavalier attitude in their management style.

'The expenditure of almost a million pounds of taxpayers’ money could have been avoided, if this employer had just followed its own policies and procedures from the outset, instead of believing that NHS funds are there to defend the indefensible, rather than deliver patient care.

'The systematic intimidation and bullying of a single individual, the like I have never seen in my career as a union regional officer, was breathtaking and callous.'

A spokesman for the trust said: 'As an organisation we take issues of any discrimination seriously. We strongly believe that discrimination did not feature in this individual’s case.'
