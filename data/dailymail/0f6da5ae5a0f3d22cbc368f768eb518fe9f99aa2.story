A Hawaiian Airlines plane was forced to come to an abrupt halt as it zoomed along a runway after the captain became concerned about an unreliable airspeed indicator in the cockpit.

There were a few frightening moments on board flight 445 – which was scheduled to travel from Honolulu, Hawaii to Auckland, New Zealand – when the captain hit the brakes moments before take-off.

The Airbus A330’s tyres burst as it came to a stop on the runway on the southern coast of Oahu.

Passenger Craig Mitchell told television station KHON2 there were ‘quite a few white faces on the plane’ but everyone remained calm and staff did an excellent job of handling the situation.

Mr Mitchell said: ‘I would say we were probably two seconds from lift-off when the captain slammed on the brakes and then he stopped right at the end of the runway and left off the runway.’

The plane was carrying 201 passengers and 12 crew when the flight crew aborted take-off.

Passenger Rosie Savaiinaea told stuff.co.nz: 'The pilot said "If you smell a smoky smell, don't worry. It's only... um... smoke".'

As a result of the disruption the travellers were given a food voucher, but were denied free wifi access inside the airport, she said.

Passengers disembarked on the runway and boarded buses to return to the terminal, where they waited nearly eight hours before they boarded a replacement plane.

The journey from Hawaii to New Zealand is approximately eight hours, but due to the time difference passengers are scheduled to arrive at Auckland at 6:30am local time tomorrow.

The Hawaiian Airlines aircraft was moved off the runway once its tyres were replaced.
