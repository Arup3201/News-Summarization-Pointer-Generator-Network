The billionaire L’Oreal heiress has sold a Seychelles island for £39 million in the middle of a tax evasion case, the island’s government have said.

Liliane Bettencourt, France’s richest woman sold the tiny island in the Indian Ocean to offshore company Save Our Seas Foundation (SOSF), a Swiss-based campaign group, for £27.7 million more than she bought it for in 1997. 

The 89-year-old’s ownership of D’Arros Island remained unknown and undeclared to French authorities until it was exposed through media reports in 2010.

Sells amid alleged tax evasion: L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt sold a tiny island in the Indian Ocean for £39 million and has been ordered to pay £85.8 million to French authorities in unpaid taxes

Seychelles Habitat Minister Christian Lionnet told a news conference on Tuesday that the government had ordered the beauty empire heiress to pay £5 million on the grounds that she had failed to properly involve their government in her purchase.

French authorities have also ordered her to pay £85.8 million in unpaid taxes after her island ownership came to light along with a number of undeclared accounts.

The island, only 1.25 miles long, is due
 to be converted to a nature reserve by SOSF who have also paid £6.8 
million for stamp duty and other taxes.

Unknown to authorities: Mrs Bettencourt's purchase of D'Arros Island in 1997 remained unknown until it was exposed in media reports in 2010

Investigations: Financial relations between Mrs Bettencourt and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy are being examined after his house was raided this month

Seychelles Environment Minister Rolph 
Payet said: ‘We are very happy because the new owners are conservation 
oriented, they have proven themselves with a good track record.’

A French investigation is examining the financial relations between Mrs Bettencourt and former president Nicolas Sarkozy, whose house police raided earlier this month as part of the inquiry. 

She is said to have provided the money in brown envelopes to fund Sarkozy’s political career and regularly invited politicians to her home in Paris in return for future tax breaks.

A lawyer for the Bettencourt family declined to comment on the sale when contacted.

In a statement SOSF said they were 'entrusted with the management' of the island.

It read: 'SOSF undertakes to keep the area as it is and to continue the important work that has been done to recover its original biodiversity.'
