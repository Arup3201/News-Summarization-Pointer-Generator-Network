Leicester hope to beat Chelsea to Andrej Kramaric on a permanent £9million deal after the Premier League leaders failed to guarantee the player could return to them after a short loan.

HNK Rijeka striker Kramaric wanted to sign for Chelsea and had agreed personal terms.

He was happy to go out on loan for this season with Leicester and Vitesse the options but wanted a guarantee he could return to Stamford Bridge in the summer.

Croatian striker Andrej Kramaric is in London to discuss a move to Chelsea or Leicester City

Kramaric, in action against Italy for Croatia, could be lining up for Chelsea or Leicester in the Premier League

The 23-year-old has managed to score 28 goals for Rijeka so far this season in the Croatian HNL

Chelsea could not commit to that and Leicester have taken control by offering extra bonus payments.

Leicester, who are also keen on signing Tottenham defender Kyle Naughton this month, have made offers for Toronto's Jermain Defoe, Mainz striker Shinji Okazaki and Burnley's Danny Ings.

They also had a £750,000 offer for Wigan's Shaun Maloney rejected.
