A high-speed police chase in which a 13-year-old girl died began when a car triggered an automatic system designed to catch wanted criminals.

The teenager suffered catastrophic injuries and died at the scene when a car smashed into the back of her family’s VW Polo.

Her mother, father and four-year-old brother, who was sitting beside her in the back seat, were also injured in the crash in New Cross, South-East London.

The computerised system is able to 
cross-reference number plates with police databases for wanted suspects,
uninsured drivers and stolen vehicles.

Last year the Met said it would double
the number of such cameras in London to make it more difficult for 
criminals to move around.

The accident took place outside a primary school and close to Millwall’s football ground shortly before 6.30pm on Sunday.

The Peugeot was chased from nearby Peckham by a marked police car with its sirens on and blue lights flashing.

The Peugeot was not stolen, A woman passenger suffered minor injuries and a man was arrested at the scene.

The Metropolitan Police said the girl’s father remained in hospital last night. Her mother and brother have been discharged.

Commander Tony Eastaugh said: ‘An innocent family are now dealing with the tragic loss of a loved one.’
