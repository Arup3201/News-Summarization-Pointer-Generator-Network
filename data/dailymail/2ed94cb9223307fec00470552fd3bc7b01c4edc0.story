Many revellers decide to pick up a kebab on the way home - but these burglers took the late-night tradition quite literally and hauled a stolen 70lb frozen lump of doner meat down the road.

The two men were caught on CCTV making off with the meat and several shish kebabs after breaking into the takeaway shop in Midlothian, Scotland.

They ignored the till and expensive computer equipment in order to grab the large meat roll, but dropped it on their feet in the rush.

Painful pinch: The owners of Kebab Mahal on Dalkeith High Street say the footage shows one of the thieves 'jumping about in agony'

The owners of Kebab Mahal on Dalkeith High Street say the footage shows one of the thieves 'jumping about in agony.'

Azher Ashid, 37, said the theft was like 'something out of America's Dumbest Criminals.'

He
said: 'I got a phone call from my brother to say he thought we had been
broken into because some of the pizza trays were out of place.

Time to strike: The two men approaching the kebab shop - as well as the frozen doner meat, the thieves made off with samosas, a 10kg container of raw marinated chicken and samosas

'The kebab machine had been moved and shish kebabs had gone missing.

'Initially, that's all we thought had been taken but when we checked the CCTV, we found they had stolen the doner meat and the chicken.

'They didn't even stop at the computers or at the till.'

The culprits, who Mr Rashid thinks were drunk were in their mid twenties.

One was wearing a green hooded top and the other a black top.

As well as the frozen doner meat, the thieves made off with samosas, a 10kg container of raw marinated chicken and samosas.

The footage shows them hauling the meat slab out of a window, which one of them had managed to slip through.

Mr Rashid continued: 'I wouldn't have thought anybody would have been able to fit through that window.

'And the doner meat weighs a lot- it takes a couple of us to safely get it out the freezer.

'On the CCTV, you see one of them pushing the meat through the window and the other boy grabbing it, before it disappears.

'The next thing you see is the guy outside jumping about in agony.

'They were a bit dumb, to be honest, it was like something out of America's Dumbest Criminals.

'Within a few hours, the doner would have defrosted and they wouldn't have had anything to cook it with.

'Most likely, they have dumped it.'

The footage then shows the pair walking off, with the uninjured thief hoisting the meat onto his shoulder.

A police spokesman said: 'Lothian and Borders Police are investigating following a break-in and theft from a takeaway store in Midlothian.

'Approximately Â£100 worth of foodstuffs were taken during the incident in the early hours of Friday, 15 June.

'Anyone who remembers seeing anything suspicious in or around the shop is asked to contact police immediately.'
