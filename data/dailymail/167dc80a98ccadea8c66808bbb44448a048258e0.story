As if having been bequeathed $12 million wasn’t enough, infamous heiress Leona Helmsley’s beloved Maltese now has a namesake posh Manhattan cocktail bar.

Though Trouble died in 2010, her memory survives in Trouble’s Trust, a newly christened addition to the luxurious New York Palace Hotel, which Helmsley once owned.

The dedication to Trouble doesn’t just end at the swanky bar’s name. Signature cocktails—like the Queen of Mean and the Pampered Pooch—are also available to sip in memory of the prosperous pooch and her famous owner.

Posh posterity: Queen of Mean Leona Helmsley left her dog Trouble $12M in 2007 and now the monied Maltese has a bar named after it, Trouble's Trust

Queen of Mean: The billionaire hotelier and heiress known for her ruthlessly mean demeanor was often seen with Trouble and left the pooch more money than she did to any of her family members

Trouble’s Trust was built as part of the Palace Hotel’s recent $140million renovation and is one of six bars and restaurants added to the Midtown Manhattan hotel.

It’s tucked under the hotel’s lavish Grand Staircase and one hotel spokesman describes it as having a ‘den-like lair’ with its bar built to look like molten metal, burgundy walls, chocolate-colored lounging chairs and, of course, menus printed with golden paws.

‘Because of its discreet location under the Grand Stair, Trouble's Trust bar is unexpected--not unlike Trouble's sizable inheritance!’ Winston Kong, principle at design firm Champalimaud told ABC News. ‘If Trouble were alive today, we can imagine the Maltese holding court on one of the tufted leather banquettes, a regal seat for Leona's beloved pet.’

Trouble would also feel right at home thanks to a selection of cocktails named for her and her doting master.

For the monied Maltese, there’s the Pampered Pooch—a rum-based, mojito-like signature concoction.

‘Trouble would love it,’ reads the menu.

To honor the notoriously nasty heiress 
and hotelier, there’s The Queen of Mean—a whiskey libation with hints of
apple, plum, ginger, elderflower and just to keep things appropriately 
sour a squeeze of fresh lemon.

Fitting tribute: Trouble's Trust is located in Manhattan's post New York Palace Hotel, which was once owned by Helmsley

Both cocktails will set you back $19.

Despite its very existence being owed to a canine, animals are regrettably not allowed in Trouble’s Trust.

‘Regretfully local laws do not permit pets in bars and restaurants,’ the bar’s mixologist Jim Saufley told ABC. ‘But I am happy to share our cocktail recipes so you can make them at home and enjoy it with your Foxhound at your feet or your Lhasa on your lap.’

'I have not made any provisions in this will for my grandson Craig Panzirer or my granddaughter Meegan Panzirer for reasons which are known to them,' the billionaire famously wrote in her will, which provided that more money be given to her Maltese named Trouble (left) than to any of her family members

When hotelier and heiress Leona Helmsley died at 87 in 2007, she left behind an estate worth $5.2 billion.

The Manhattan businesswoman, who was famously quoted as saying 'only the little people pay taxes' before going to jail for tax evasion for 18 months in 1989, also left behind a very peculiar last will and testament.

Her trusted pooch Trouble, for instance, received $12 million--more than anyone else named in the 14-page document.

Helmsley also famously wrote in the will: 'I have not made any provisions in this will for my grandson Craig Panzirer or my granddaughter Meegan Panzirer for reasons which are known to them.'

Two other grandchildren, David and Walter Panzirer, received $5million each so long as each 'visits the grave of my late son at least once each calendar year preferably on the anniversary of my son's said death.'

Should they miss a visit, the will stipulates, they will receive no more money.

To her chauffeur, Helmsley left $100,000.

For her own afterlife accommodations, Helmsley's will sets aside a $3million trust for the upkeep of the $1.4 million mausoleum she built to share with her late husband Harry that must be 'acid washed or steam cleaned at least once a year.'

The Helmsley's now share their ornate Sleep Hollow, New York mausoleum with Trouble.
