Cops are hunting for the heartless driver who intentionally ran over and killed a dog in St. Petersburg, Florida.

One witness to Monday's horrific incident said the vehicle turned around and chased the dog, who was 'running for its life.'

The 6-year-old dog, Snoopy, was known to frequently dart out of the home of his owner, Paul Alves, but would always return.

But after Snoopy, a Jack Russell 
terrier, got out Monday morning while he was getting ready for work as a plumber, Alves, 38, 
grew concerned when his pet didn't return for an hour.

'He's usually pretty good,' Alves told theÂ Tampa Bay Times.

'Whenever he's gotten out, he sort of just pokes around in the alley for a little bit and then comes back.'

Alves went into the alley to look for his beloved dog and came upon his neighbor and her children, who were noticeably upset, standing over Snoopy's lifeless body.

Police said the driver of the dark colored sedan seems to have purposefully stuck the dog.

'It appears the driver intentionally struck this dog,' police spokesman 
Mike Puetz said.

'At this point [police] would just like to interview the 
driver in order to determine their intent.'

Elizabeth McNeal said she saw the car, possibly a Hyundai Sonata, speeding behind the alley and then saw Snoopy.

'The dog was running for its life,' she recalled, adding that the driver had turned around and was chasing the pet.

'Then they just hit it," McNeal said.

'I heard the dog yelp. The car kept going. I was so shocked.'

She immediately called police. Within a few minutes, Alves made his way into the alley.

'It was just horrible,' Alves told the Times. 'You could see his neck was broken.'

The sickening incident was recorded on a neighbor's security camera and police hope that will help catch the driver.

They are asking anyone with information to call, (727) 893-7780.
