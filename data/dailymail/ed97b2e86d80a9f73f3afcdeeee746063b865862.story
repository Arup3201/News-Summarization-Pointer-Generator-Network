Thousands of coasting schools across the country have fallen foul of a tougher inspection regime, figures out today show.

In a crackdown on mediocrity, the schools watchdog Ofsted is ordering them to improve.

The move follows the introduction of hard-hitting inspections to rout out poor performance.

Tougher times: Thousands of British schools have been ordered to improve or face action by Ofstead

In a major speech today, Ofsted’s chief inspector, Sir Michael Wilshaw, will praise schools that strive to raise standards.

But he will warn that those only doing the minimum to get by will have to raise their game or face severe sanctions.

Since September 2012, all schools have been required to achieve at least a ‘good’ rating.

Before then, schools were rated as outstanding, good, satisfactory or inadequate. However, the satisfactory rating was scrapped and replaced by ‘requires improvement’ to highlight continuing weaknesses.

Schools are now rated on the four-point scale of outstanding, good, requires improvement and inadequate.

Changes: In September, the satisfactory rating was scrapped and replaced by 'requires improvement' to highlight continuing weaknesses in schools

Ofsted figures released today will reveal that more than 7,000 state schools in England were inspected between September 1, 2012, and June 30 this year. Of these, almost a third – around 2,000 – fall into the ‘requires improvement’ category.

They will be inspected more regularly, with Ofsted monitoring progress and checking action plans, and will be subject to a full re-inspection within two years.

Schools judged to require improvement at three consecutive inspections are likely to be placed in special measures, which means they face the sacking of the head and other staff, the replacement of the governors and even the closure of the school.

Schools judged ‘satisfactory’ before September last year did not automatically fall into the ‘requires improvement’ category, but they are expected to improve before their next inspection. The changed ratings also mean that to be judged ‘outstanding’, a school must have outstanding teaching.

In addition, they face inspections at short notice, with the head only being notified at lunchtime the day before.

Speaking in Manchester, Sir Michael will insist that the overhaul is leading to improved standards across the country, with more schools moving into the ‘good’ category after rising to the challenge.

The former head teacher will be addressing an audience of outstanding head teachers and urging them to share their expertise.

He is expected to reiterate his view that the new inspection regime is having a ‘galvanising effect’ on head teachers and making them prioritise improvements.

Earlier this year, he said: ‘Heads and governing boards have a much greater focus on tackling the central issues of school improvement.’

Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research, said yesterday: ‘Prior to the new category, we’d actually been fooling ourselves about how well our schools were doing.

‘We were marking them as satisfactory whereas this new category shows a lot of them weren’t satisfactory at all but needing improvement. Ofsted has raised the bar, so – rightly – it’s expecting more of schools. It’s giving us a clearer picture of how well schools are doing.

‘It’s bringing things which need to be addressed to our attention.’

Chris McGovern, a former head teacher and chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, added: ‘It’s right there should be a more rigorous inspection as we obviously want the best for the children.

‘For too long, schools have been prepared to accept a satisfactory grading as a green light to coast.’

Ofsted has already introduced a tougher framework to stop weak head teachers bumping up their overall ratings by concentrating on areas such as pupil wellbeing, spiritual development and community cohesion. Since last January, schools have been judged on four key areas – teaching, pupil results, behaviour and leadership.
