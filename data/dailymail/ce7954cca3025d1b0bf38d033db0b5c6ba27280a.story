A black market surgery victim too ashamed to date after being turned into a 'monster' has undergone a dramatic transformation.

Rajee Narinesingh, 46, from Miami, was dubbed 'cement face' after a fake medic pumped a concrete-like filler into her cheeks, lips, breasts and buttocks.

But, thanks to a kind-hearted doctor, her previously 'hard-as-rock' face is much improved and she is now swamped by admirers.

Rajee Narinesingh was too ashamed to date but is now fighting off men after having her face fixed

She said: 'For years I was too ashamed and embarrassed to face dating.

'Now I'm feeling more confident and with a good bit of makeup I can achieve somewhat of an exotic look.

'Recently this guy said that being with me is like being with a sexy dragon. I didn't know whether to slap him or kiss him.'

Rajee, who was born a man, is given monthly softening injections and laser therapy by Dr John Martin of Coral Gables Cosmetic Reconstructive Surgery, Miami.

This has helped reduce the size of the nodules on her face.

The self-confessed cougar has grown in confidence and is now a regular on the Miami dating scene and has been flooded with romantic requests online.

She said: 'A lot of the men I date are straight and so they like to do a lot of dating under the radar.'That can be really hard to deal with. But now my confidence is up I feel like I could meet a boyfriend or a husband who loves me for who I am.

'I definitely deserve more than just the 3 o'clock in the morning knock on the window.'

The transgender activist has also been buoyed by the news that the fake doctor who operated on her has been jailed.

Oneal Ron Morris, 32, herself a transgendered woman, was jailed for 366 days in January after admitting one count of practicing healthcare without a license.

Morris reportedly injected Fix-a-Flat, Super Glue and mineral oil into the buttocks of women during illegal cosmetic surgeries.

Rajee, who was born in New York but grew up in Philadelphia, was bullied at school.

She said: 'Up
 until I was in my mid-twenties I just thought I was a feminine gay 
male. I thought about all the things I did when I was growing up -
 like taking the basketball my dad had bought me and instead of playing 
basketball with it I was simulating pregnancy and actually pretending to
 give birth and be a mommy.

'When I used to fantasise about 
being with guys I used to always picture myself with breasts and a 
vagina. I didn't realise I was doing it, it was just so natural for me. 
One day I just connected all the dots and thought 'you're not gay, 
you're transgender.'

Rajee, who had been too 'embarrassed and ashamed' to go to the authorities, says she paid just £60 per session to Morris for the life-changing injections back in 2005.

She said: 'The last thing I wanted was to look like a man in a dress. I wanted to be a beautiful woman. 

'If you really want to live your authentic self as a woman you need to do some sort of face and body reconstruction.

'So I made the choice to get injections done. In our community it is called 'pumping'.'

She
 told Miami television station CBS4 at the time: 'It becomes so dire 
that you want to match your outside with your inside that you're willing
 to roll the dice and take your chances.

'As
 a transgender person, you're thinking, "Oh, my God, I can start to look
 like I want to look like and I don't have to spend a lot of money."'

Rajee, born a man, soon realised she was a woman in a man's body

'When
 it finally came to the day, I was more excited than nervous because I 
was finally going to be the woman I had always wanted to be.

'There was a room that she had set up where she did a lot of medical procedures.

'It
 appeared to be pretty sterile. It was like an extra bedroom that she 
had turned into a clinical area and I would go in and pay the money.

'I got injections in my face and my hips and my buttocks and initially I was fine. But then the nightmare started.

'It first felt like a huge boil on the side of my face and then it kept getting bigger and bigger as the day went along.

'It
 got really painful and then suddenly green pus exploded out of my face 
and onto the mirror. It was green and yellow and mixed with blood. It 
was terrible.

She added: 'Sometimes I wake up in bed in the middle of the night and I ask myself: 'What have you done?

'My
 message to anyone that would consider doing what I did is don't do it. 
Do not do it. You could die or you could end up like me: disfigured.'

Rajee,
 who spent a total of £1,825 ($3,000) over 10 months on the injections, 
spent years in solitude suffering from post-traumatic stress, depression
 and agoraphobia.

But her life changed when two years later a friend referred her to Dr Martin, who offered to help her for free.

The operations she has had and is having with Dr John Martin are kenalog facial injections, laser surgery and ultrasound. These help reduce the size of the nodules in her face.

She
 also had two invasive surgeries earlier in her treatment with Dr John 
Martin. In the first one his scissor broke while trying to remove the 
filler because the lumps were 'as hard as concrete'.

He said: 'The progress Rajee is making is actually much better than I had ever hoped or expected.

'We thought that the 
nodules would probably just soften up a little bit - but there are now 
some areas on her face where they actually seem to have gone away.

'The future for Rajee's face is much more positive but I worry about the inflammation in the rest of her body.

'She
 has had a a really large volume of substance injected into both her 
breasts and buttocks and we're not quite sure what it is.'

He added: 'This sort of black-market 
surgery is probably the worst thing you could do. You're lucky if you 
just develop nodules. Other people have lost limbs or even died.'

For now Rajee says she plans to continue to enjoy her life as best she can with her tight-knit network of friends.

And while she will always continue to suffer the effects of the injections, she is determined to enjoy life - and love - once again.

She said: 'I feel like I have somehow managed to turn lemons into lemonade. I am finally starting a new chapter in my life.

'With Dr Martin helping me to improve my looks a great deal I'm feeling much more confident and optimistic for the future.

'I've gone from being victim to victorius.'
