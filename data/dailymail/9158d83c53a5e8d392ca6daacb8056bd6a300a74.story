Michael Clarke says there's a chance he 'may never play again' after suffering a hamstring injury during Saturday's final day of play in the first Test against India.

Clarke was sent for scans after limping from Adelaide Oval with a right hamstring injury.

'The scans are not great, they have certainly showed a tear there. The experts are looking at them and I can pretty confidently say that I won't take part in this Test series,' Clarke said.

'I don't know exactly how long I'm going to be out for,' said Michael Clarke at a post-match press conference after suffering a hamstring injury in Saturday's first Test match against India.

'I don't know exactly how long I'm going to be out for.

'There's no doubt there's certainly a chance, well there's a chance I may never play again.

'I hope that's not the case and I'll be doing everything in my power to get back out on the park, but I have to be realistic as well.'

Clarke has suffered serious right and left hamstring injuries in the past four months, and he was given injections to sooth his his chronic back injury when it flared up on Tuesday. 

'I did my left hamstring (three times in the past four months). I've done my right side of my back, I've just done my right hammy.  

'I have no regrets about playing this Test match. I have no regrets about going back on the field after I retired hurt,' he said.

'I don't have one regret. This is the most important Test match of my career.

'Once you walk into the game, you have to do whatever it takes to finish that game,' he said. 'Now I've got to go back and do what the experts tell me, to give myself my best chance of being fully fit.'

Michael Clarke is in serious doubt for the second Test starting in Brisbane on Wednesday, after suffering another injury fielding at the Adelaide Oval today.

The injury is a devastating blow to Australia on an otherwise exceptional day for the Australian team after Nathan Lyon dismantled the Indian batsmen in a remarkable 48-run win.

Virat Kohli crafted a career-best century, but Lyon's maiden 10-wicket Test haul proved the difference as the hosts clinched victory on Saturday. 

The enthralling battle between chief protagonists Lyon and Kohli ended in the 82nd over.

India's stand-in skipper holed out on 141, Mitch Marsh misreading the ball but completing an awkward catch in the deep.

Ryan Harris and Mitchell Johnson claimed a wicket each after the final drinks break.

But Lyon fittingly ended the game when he had Ishant Sharma stumped and India all out for 315 in the 88th over.

Lyon finished with incredible match figures of 12-286, bouncing back superbly after an underwhelming tour of the UAE, where he captured three Test wickets at an average of 140. 

Australian captain Michael Clarke went down fielding a ground ball at mid wicket after lunch and left the field clutching his right hamstring. He was assisted back to the sheds by team physiotherapist Alex Kountouris.

This latest setback continues a terrible run of injuries for Clarke, who had been in doubt of playing the first Test scheduled for Brisbane before the freak accident which caused the death of his 'little brother' Phillip Hughes.

Clarke strained his left hamstring in a one day international in Perth last month, then suffered a recurrence of a degenerative back injury that forced him to retire hurt on 60 while batting on Tuesday. 

The 33-year-old returned the next day after extensive treatment to post a courageous 128 and was fielding in pain during the Indians' two innings.

Australia declared its second innings closed at 5/290, with Steve Smith - who scored 162 not out in the first innings - again left unbeaten on 52. Brad Haddin was not out on 14. David Warner, who scored 145 in the first innings, knocked up 102 in the second.

The overnight declaration left India with a target of 364 for victory today. At tea, India was 2/205, with stand-in captain Virat Kohli on 82 (off 112 balls) and Murali Vijay on 85 (off 208).

Earlier, Mitchell Johnson had Shikhar Dhawan caught by Brad Haddin for 21, while Haddin also caught Cheteshwar Pujara off Nathan Lyon for 21. 

The Brisbane Test was delayed after the death of former Test opener Phillip Hughes, who was struck in the neck by a bouncer playing for South Australia against NSW on November 25. He died two days later.

The Australian captain said it was 'heartbreaking' to miss any game of cricket and that he still hopes to be able to play in the upcoming World Cup. 

'Our first (World Cup) practice game is eight weeks away,' he said. 'I'd love to take part in the tri-series, I'd love to take part in the World Cup but I just have to wait and see.

'Hopefully I'll get another opportunity to play again this summer.'
