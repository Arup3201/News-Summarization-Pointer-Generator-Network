The biological parents of a baby born to a Thai surrogate mother and allegedly abandoned for having Down syndrome say they did even not know he existed.

Pattaramon Chanbua, the child's 21-year-old mother, claims that the Australian couple took her son's twin sister but left him behind because he was sick.

However, the father today told the ABC that they knew nothing about the six-month-old boy and believed that the surrogate had only given birth to a girl.

He also said that Ms Pattaramon was not the woman he believed to have carried his child and that he had had problems with the Thai agency, which has now shut down.

The couple have not been identified but live in Bunbury, in Western Australia. They are expected to release a statement through a lawyer some time in the coming hours.

Gammy's mother has threatened to sue the family, claiming that the children’s biological father, who is in his 50s, had visited her after she gave birth.

He had only bought milk for the girl, she claimed, and ‘never looked at Gammy’.

'The twins stayed next to each other but the father never looked at Gammy...could say he never touched Gammy at all,' she said.

The Abbott government may intervene, saying that Gammy could be eligibly for Australian citizenship

Ms Pattaramon told the ABC that the pair had cried on the day that they collected their daughter from hospital but left their son behind.

She also alleges that they asked her to have an abortion when she found out that she was carrying a child with Down Syndrome.

Gammy’s plight has provoked fury across the world with critics savaging his biological parents. Donations have poured in and now stand at more than $200,000.

Meanwhile the little boy is still gravely ill at Samitivej Sriracha Hospital in Chonburi province, southeastern Thailand.

He is battling a lung infection and, at one point, his birth mother did not expect him to survive.

Australia’s Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has labelled Ms Pattaramon a ‘saint’ and an ‘absolute hero’ and said the outpouring of support was a strong indicator of the way Australians felt about the situation.

Gammy's story could prompt the Australian government to look closer at surrogacy laws with the Department of Foreign Affairs already examining practices in Thailand.

Agencies were working with Thai officials on the broader surrogacy issues, the department said.

Mr Morrison said the legalities surrounding international surrogacy were ‘very, very, very murky’ and regulations must be looked at carefully.

‘Sure, there are lots of Australians who are desperate to be parents but that can never, I think, sanction what we have just seen here,’ he said.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has also said the case illustrates the pitfalls of international surrogacy.

Commercial surrogacy, where a woman is paid a fee to carry a child, is illegal in Australia.

However, if there is an agreement for the biological parents to cover just medical and other reasonable costs, the practice is legal.

Ms Chanbua previously said she loved the six-month-old boy like he was her own child, and has vowed to care for her son

Ms Pattaramon told of her heartbreak at Gammy's situation, saying she loved the baby boy like he was her own.

'This was the adults' fault. And who is he to endure something like this even though it's not his fault?' she told the ABC.

'Why does he have to be abandoned and the other baby has it easy?

Ms Chanbua said she treated the six-month-old like he was one of her own children.

'I love him, he was in my tummy for nine months, it’s like my child,' she told the ABC.'Never think that you're not my child, that I don't care for you.'

'I would like to tell Thai women – don't get into this business as a surrogate. Don't just think only for money ... if something goes wrong no one will help us and the baby will be abandoned from society, then we have to take responsibility for that,' Ms Chanbua said, The Sydney Morning Herald reported earlier on Friday.

The campaign by charity Hands Across The Water is still ongoing and they have vowed to donate every cent raised to looking after the little boy

The young mother, who lives 90km south of Bangkok and has two other children, aged three and six, was paid a total of $16,000 by the couple to give birth to the baby.

The couple paid an extra $1673 when they first realised - three-months into the pregnancy - that Ms Chanbua was having twins for them and reportedly told her to have an abortion. Ms Chanbua is a Buddhist and refused to have the abortion on moral grounds.

She originally agreed to become a surrogate mother because of her family's financial problems and the arrangement was set-up through an agency, which has since been closed down.

The Australian man and his ethnic-Asian wife could not conceive a baby themselves.

'Because of the poverty and debts, the money that was offered was a lot for me,' she told the ABC.

'In my mind, with that money, we one could educate my children and two we can repay our debt.'

Commercial surrogacy is banned in Australia and it is illegal for people living in Queensland, NSW and the ACT to undertake commercial surrogacy in Thailand. It's also illegal for Australians to select a baby's sex.

Current Australian Medicare policy forbids Medicare rebates for IVF use for surrogacy and to receive surrogacy as a treatment option in Australia the following conditions must be fulfilled:

Many Australians have flocked to Thailand over the years because the rules were far less strict. However, the rules have changed this week.

After Thailand’s military government reviewed 12 Thai IVF clinics involved in surrogacy cases they have announced new laws.  

Surrogacy is now only recognised in Thailand if:

Surrogacy in Thailand is illegal if:

These new laws will now exclude almost every Australian from pursuing surrogacy in Thailand.
