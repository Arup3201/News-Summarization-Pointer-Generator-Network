Jeremy Dee, managing director of Swizzels, said: 'We had thousands of suggestions submitted. 

'It's extremely rare for us to change the messages on the Love Hearts, but we felt that bringing some of our messages up to date and adding new, contemporary phrases was a great way to mark the 60th anniversary of our most iconic brand.'

Swizzels is the UK's largest family-owned independent sugar confectionery business and one of the few confectionery companies to still manufacture sweets in the UK. 

The company makes a range of products including Love Hearts, New Refreshers, Drumstick Lollies, Rainbow Drops, Double Lollies and Fruity Pops.
