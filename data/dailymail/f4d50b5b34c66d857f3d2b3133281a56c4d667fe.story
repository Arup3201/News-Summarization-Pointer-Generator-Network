A young driver who crashed her car into a rail and killed her friend after he pulled her bikini top string as she drove at 65mph has been cleared.

Brittany Lahm, 24, from Manhattan, crashed on the Thruway, New York, in July 2008, killing Brandon Berman, 19, and injuring several other passengers.

Moments before Mr Berman had playfully untied her bathing suit top as they returned home from a day at Jersey Shore to celebrate Mr Berman's 19th birthday.

Ruling: Brittany Lahm, 24, from Manhattan, crashed on the Thruway, New York, in July 2008, killing Brandon Berman, 19 and injuring several other passengers

Miss Lahm took her hands off the wheel to cover up and the Lexus veered off course and struck the guardrail, flipped multiple times in the air, before coming to rest on its roof in the middle of the southbound lanes.

Mr Berman of New City was a rear seat passenger - he was partially ejected and suffered massive head trauma. He was pronounced dead at Nyack Hospital.

The Brooklyn Appellate Division upheld the conclusion of a Rockland jury, which found Miss Lahm's bikini top problem constituted 'a sudden and unforeseen emergency not of her own making' reported the New York Daily News.

It was decided that even though Mr Berman had acted disruptively throughout car ride, 'Brittany did not anticipate that he would suddenly pull the strings on her bikini top, thereby causing the top to fall and her breasts to be exposed.'

The decision was taken following a civil trial brought by Jason Pelletier of Suffern.

He sued Miss Lahm for damages after his promising football career at Yale University was cut short due to his injuries.

He was in the rear seat of the car and testified at the 2011 trial that Miss Lahm had leaned forward for up to 20 seconds as she tried to retie her bikini top.

His lawyers argued she should have pulled over saying 'the plaintiff argues that Defendant Brittany Lahm should have slowed her vehicle down, kept both hands on the wheel, and pulled off of the highway, before attempting to re-tie her bathing suit, and the mere fact that she may have been embarrassed by the exposure of her breasts to the passengers in the car does not excuse her failure to do so.'

But Miss Lahm testified that her hands were off the steering wheel for only a split second and the jury absolved her of any liability.

The dissenting appellate judge, Justice Sheri Roman, said that Mr Berman’s behavior was disruptive before the bikini top prank - he had opened an umbrella inside the car and stuck his feet in the driver’s face.

'That Brandon would ultimately commit an act which would cause Brittany to lose control of the vehicle, under the circumstances of this case, cannot be deemed sudden or unexpected,' Ms Roman wrote.

Miss Lahm now works as an 'Assistant to GM of WWE Music Group' according to her LinkedIn page.

In 2011 she graduated from Syracuse University following a four year degree in Music & Entertainment Industries.

Before the crash Miss Lahm was a member of pop music girl band Huckapoo - each member portrayed a character from a different social group typically found on any high school campus and Miss Lahm was a cheerleader.

After the ruling Miss Lahm declined to comment.
