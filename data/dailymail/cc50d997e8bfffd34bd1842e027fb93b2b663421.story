What a match we have in store at the Rec on Sunday. Both Bath and Glasgow have everything to play for, with qualification to the knock-out stage of the Champions Cup up for grabs.

It is remarkable that, along with Toulouse, all three teams can finish first, second or third so the group is on a knife-edge.

It is still in the hands of Toulouse as, if they win in Montpellier, they win the group and Bath and Glasgow are playing for second. But stranger things have happened and Montpellier look like they have improved under Jake White, so they’ll give Toulouse a real challenge.

Both Bath and Glasgow know that a win is vital if they are to have any chance of progressing and things would be even better if the win came with a bonus point as well.

Those circumstances mean we should have a cracker of a game, with both teams throwing everything at each other.

Bath are extremely confident after their amazing performance last week in Toulouse which gave them a bonus-point win, but Glasgow had a good result last week too against Montpellier — albeit without getting the bonus point.

Bath go into this game  as clear favourites for a number of reasons — they look to be at full-strength whilst Glasgow have severe problems in the back row, they are playing at home and have momentum on their side.

There are some fantastic match-ups throughout the teams that will go a long way to determining the outcome of the match. Here are just three:

George Ford v Finn Russell

Without doubt, if both stay fit, these two will start for their respective countries at stand-off in the Six Nations. Ford was immense last week, mixing his game up beautifully, kicking well when he needed to and seeing when things were on to attack, even when deep within his own 22. They are different physically, Russell is much taller, but they are very similar in how they play the game.

Both kick and pass well and they are both very brave in defence; they both attack the line at pace, too, which creates so much space out wide for the outside backs. 

They love to attack, have good awareness when things are on or not and they will have a go. This is a big test for Russell in his young career because he needs to try and get the upper hand over Ford, no small task the way the Englishman is playing. 

Ford can be put under pressure though, the big Premiership sides like Northampton and Saracens have really asked questions of him and he has not coped well. What does not help Russell is that his back row is decimated and they have a hooker playing openside.

Back three

I have bundled the back three together because all three match-ups are good. The wingers — Matt Banahan and Horacio Agulla against Tommy Seymour and DTH van der Merve — all share many of the same qualities; size, power, and, above all, pace.

They all work very hard off the ball as well, popping up on the other wing and usually being in the right place at the right time. The Glasgow wingers just shade it when it comes to form, DTH scored a hat trick last week and Seymour has been on fire all season.

I have high expectations of the full-back contest between Anthony Watson against Sean Maitland. I am a big fan of Watson, who glides across the ground effortlessly but with genuine pace. Give him space and he can be devastating. 

Maitland announced this week that he is leaving at the end of the season to join London Irish so he will want to justify this by playing well. He has been more of a winger recently but he likes the space that full-back gives you and he can have a huge impact on this game.

Back row

I don’t think there is much between the two sides in general, apart from in the back row. Glasgow have been devastated by injury here and it is such a shame. 

I would have loved to have seen Josh Strauss, Rob Harley and Adam Ashe take the field but all are injured along with Ryan Wilson, Chris Fusaro and Tyrone Holmes. This means that Warriors are fielding a second row, a hooker and a centre in the back row!

Leone Nakarawe, Fraser Brown and Richie Vernon would not have expected to play together in such a big game but they are and they will need to produce miracles against a very good Bath back row.

At openside Francois Louw was brilliant last week in Toulouse, running great support lines and being strong in defence, and this is the one position that might settle this game. Fraser Brown is a good player but he is a hooker, not an openside. 

My concern for Glasgow is that Louw could dominate things in attack and defence because he is a wily old fox and he could get to Finn Russell in defence with no recognised back row to defend him.
