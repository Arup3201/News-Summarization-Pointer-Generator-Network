Network Rail bosses are on track for nearly £5million of 'double your money' bonuses after a controversial new incentive scheme was nodded through at the company's annual meeting .

It means the top five rail directors are set to share in total pay-outs worth more than £11million - comprising basic salary, annual bonuses and long-term bonuses - for just three years' work.

This is despite Network Rail missing all of its passenger train punctuality targets in 2012-13 and being warned by watchdogs that it is steaming towards a £75million fine by Spring next year over fears it will miss future targets for long distance services.

Pay day: Network Rail bosses are in line for millions of pounds in extra bonuses by 2015 under a deal agreed today

Angry critics and unions condemned the bonuses as 'rewards for failure' and 'a gravy train', branding the five top directors of the taxpayer-funded track operator 'fat controllers' presiding over crowded trains, late-running services and inflation-busting fares.

The five directors' income is made up of three distinct pots - their annual salaries, their annual bonuses, and a 'long term incentive' payment paid at the end of three years and worth a maximum of a full-year's salary.

The total potential bonuses might have been closer to £6million, but the directors were docked up to £1million from their annual bonuses last year because they failed to hit some targets.

The new long term bonus element- worth £2million alone - was rubber-stamped at Network Rail's annual general meeting in Cardiff. It was voted on by Network Rail's 44 'members' - the company's equivalent to shareholders - whose job is to hold the board to account. However, as a company limited by guarantee, Network Rail's members do not have any financial interest in the company.

It means that over three years:

The annual bonuses pays bosses up to 60per cent of their salary provided they meet targets on punctuality as well as train company and passenger satisfaction. But with these targets missed last year, executives received just 17 per cent rather than the maximum 60 per cent of salary.

The Transport Salaried Staffs Association's (TSSA) described the bonus vote as 'rewarding failure' amid concerns about service punctuality, rising train fares and a number of rail-related deaths.

TSSA's general secretary Manuel Cortes said the union was 'bitterly disappointed' by the plan: 'Once again public members of Network Rail have put the interests of bosses ahead of passengers. These bosses will be on board a very lucrative gravy train while the poor passengers pay through the nose with annual above-inflation fare rises.'

But Network Rail defended the bonuses and said they would only be achieved - in part or in full - if 'tough' targets were met.

Last year, following political pressure, bosses waived a bonus package and instead allocated their windfall to a safety improvement programme - which has seen Network Rail placed in the spotlight following a series of high profile incidents.

Earlier this year, Network Rail was handed a £450,000 fine for failing to ensure the safety of 52-year-old Jane Harding killed who was killed when her car was hit by a train at a level crossing in Herefordshire, in January 2010.

Network Rail 's Australian-born chief executive Mr Higgins told members at its annual meeting that 750 crossings had been closed noting: 'In my opinion the only good level crossing is a closed one.'

Mr Higgins also conceded that more could have been done to prevent the death of 26-year-old rail worker Scott Dobson, who died after being hit by a train near Lincoln last December.

TSSA general secretary Manuel Cortes condemned the 'unfair' long-term bonus scheme

Before the vote TSSA union general secretary Manuel Cortes wrote to the voting members urging them to reject the 'generous' but 'unfair' long-term bonus scheme.

He told them: 'Long term and annual bonuses could produce total bonus payments of £5.8million in the three years ending in April 2015.

That huge amount would be on top of an annual salary bill of some £6million for the same period for the same five executives, giving potential total earnings of over £11 million between the period 2012 and 2015.'

He noted: 'We regard those sort of payments at a tax payer funded infrastructure firm as wholly wrong, especially in view of the executives missed punctuality targets and safety record in recent years.'

Network Rail said the long term bonus is 'to recognise outstanding and exceptional performance over the three years to 2015.'

It said any future awards will be measured against train performance, savings made for the taxpayer and the successful delivery of congestion easing projects.

Network Rail chairman Richard Parry-Jones, who does not receive any bonuses said: 'Network Rail executives are rewarded only when exceptional performance exceeds tough targets, which have been approved by our members through an open and transparent process.

'If targets are not met, or safety comprised, no bonuses are made.'

He insisted the firm had made exceptional progress over the past 12 months with passenger numbers rising to 1.5 billion and £4.4billion worth of improvement on 'Victorian' rail network.

The long-term bonus plan targets include: taxpayer savings (50% of total), train performance and punctuality (25% of total), and its management of capital projects (25% of total). Network Rail said: 'Under the scheme, pay-outs would commence at 25% of annual salary if performance was deemed to have exceeded expectations using the above measures.'
