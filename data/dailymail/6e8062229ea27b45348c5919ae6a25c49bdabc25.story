A ten-year-old child stole the limelight at yesterday’s Eastern Conference Finals game between Miami Heat and Indiana Pacers, with an impressive tribute costume to his favourite player.

Basketball fan Gianni Zandri spends hours preparing for each game in order to perfectly imitate Miami Heat forward Chris ‘Birdman’ Anderson.

Gianni, from Naples, Florida, attends each Miami Heat game dressed as the NBA player, including his tattoos and mohawk.

Superfan: Gianni Zandri, believed to be 11 years old, turns himself into a perfect imitation of the heavily tattooed and mohawk-ed Chris 'Birdman' Andersen ahead of Miami Heat games

According to his Instagram, Gianni 
spent 4.5 hours at a local tattoo parlour ahead of Monday’s game, where 
an artist put the needles down and drew child-friendly copies of 
Birdman’s skin art.

As well 
as copying his idol’s tattooed sleeves and chest, Gianni also shaves his
 head into a Mohawk before taking his seat by the court in his Miami 
Heat jersey.

Gianni has 
become somewhat of a celebrity at the AmericanAirlines Arena in Miami, 
posing with everyone from Shaquille O’Neal to Chris Webber and – of 
course – Chris Anderson himself.

Although
 he was as dedicated as ever on Monday, Gianni missed out on his role 
model as Chris Anderson has been grounded due to a thigh injury.

Calling himself 'Little Birdman', Gianni has become somewhat of a mascot for Miami Heat, posing with several big names in the past year - including Birdman himself

Copy-bird? Although Gianni stared off with just a mohawk and a jersey, he now imitates Chris 'Bridman' Anderson's tattooed sleeves and chest when he attends Miami Heat games

LeBron
 James produced a blistering 14-point third quarter as the Miami Heat 
took a commanding 3-1 lead over the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern 
Conference finals with a 102-90 win.

The
 Heat led 49-44 at the half, with Chris Bosh having his best performance
 of the postseason with 17 first-half points, but the home side ran away
 with the game in the third.

Miami
 burst out with a 7-0 streak to grab a 12-point lead and LeBron took 
charge with two spectacular three-pointers and a ferocious dunk among 
his 14 points in the third.
