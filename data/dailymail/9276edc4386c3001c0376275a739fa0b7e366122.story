Federal immigration authorities have arrested a former Northern California priest and are preparing to deport him to Mexico after he admitted to having sex with a 16-year-old altar girl - including in his church rectory. 

Hector Coria Gonzales, 46, was arrested at his home in Davis on Friday, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials.

He is being held without bond at the Sacramento County's Rio Cosumnes Correctional Center while his case is reviewed by an immigration court.

Gonzales was previously arrested on May 9, 2014 on suspicion of engaging in sexual activity with the girl on several occasions which took place in a car, at a home and at the church rectory, according to the Davis Enterprise. 

The following month, he pleaded guilty to statutory rape in Yolo County Superior Court for engaging in sexual acts with the girl, who was identified as 'M.L.' in court documents and belonged to the St. James' Parish in Davis where he served as a priest.

He was in the country legally, but that changed when the Catholic Church stripped him of his priesthood after his conviction.

Earlier reports said the sexual acts between Gonzales and the girl occurred from April 2013 to May 2014.

After he pleaded guilty, Sacramento Catholic Church officials said they would ask the Vatican to have him defrocked, according to the Daily Democrat.

Gonzales was being held without bond at the Sacramento County's Rio Cosumnes Correctional Center while his case is reviewed by an immigration court. In June, he pleaded guilty in Yolo County Superior Court to engaging in sexual acts with the girl, who was identified as 'M.L.' in court documents and belonged to the St. James' Parish in Davis where he served as a priest

'Father Coria's behavior with the minor was a crime and a sin,' Kevin Eckery, a spokesman for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sacramento told The Bee last year in a statement. 'He will now be held to account for his behavior.'

During his sentencing last August, M.L. indicated that she was not abused or manipulated by Gonzales and that she did not want or need protection, according to earlier reports.

Gonzales was reportedly sentenced to three months in jail and three years of probation after he pleaded guilty, according to ABC News 10. 

Michael Vaughn, assistant field office director for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations, said: 'We entrust members of the clergy to act as role models for our youth.

'Tragically, when that trust is violated, the effects are far-reaching.'
