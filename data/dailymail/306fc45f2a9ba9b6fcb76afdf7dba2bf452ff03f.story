Judge Richard Bray who says politicians are 'tinkering' with the justice system

Politicians are ‘tinkering’ with the justice system by inventing new ways to help criminals avoid jail, a senior judge has warned.

Judge Richard Bray, who retired last week, fired a parting shot at Governments for introducing the raft of ‘warnings, reprimands and cautions’ that allow offenders to dodge appearing in court.

The proper role of politicians, he said, was to make sure there was enough jail space for everyone that judges thought needed to be locked up.

But instead they were turning judges into ‘civil servants’ by influencing the sentences they hand down.

He also condemned police officers for fiddling crime figures by downgrading offences.

The outspoken circuit judge made his comments last week as he stepped down from the role he has occupied for 21 years.

The judge won plaudits from the public when, in 2007, he refused to comply with a demand from the then Labour Home Secretary John Reid that only dangerous criminals should be sent to prison.

At the time, he said the reason prisons were full was that judges were prevented from passing ‘deterrent sentences’.

His latest comments were made at an event to mark his retirement at Northampton Crown Court.

He said there was too much meddling with sentencing which was designed to save money and place fewer people behind bars.

He said: ‘Over the years I’ve seen a number of Government initiatives with sentencing. We’ve had suspended sentences introduced, abolished then introduced again.

‘All this tinkering about is more to do with money and votes rather than criminal justice, while all the while the prison population has continued to rise. None of the Government initiatives have worked.

‘The final solution the Government has reached is by preventing courts from being given the chance to send offenders to prison and make their savings that way.

‘We’ve now got warnings, reprimands, cautions, conditional discharges that prevent people from appearing in court.’

The judge said police had ‘massaged’ the crime figures.

‘Robbery
 is now classified as ‘theft from a person’, burglary is downgraded to 
criminal damage. Cautions and reprimands are used to save police time,’ 
he added.

‘Magistrates’ courts are withering away and have been closed down as the number of criminal cases decreases.

‘But
 you ask the people who walk about the streets of towns and cities at 
night if crime has gone down and they will give you a very different 
picture.’

The judge, who lists his interests in Who’s Who as Cricket, Real tennis and gardening, admitted his ‘guiding philosophy’ was always to do justice without fear or favour and ‘to speak frankly where necessary in the public interest’.

He said governments had reduced judges sentencing powers to governments reducing sentencing to what amounted to a ‘tick in a box’.

He said it was wrong of government to tell judges what to do, but ‘up to the executive to make sure they have enough spaces in prison for the judge to send them to.’

The ability of judges to make decisions without fear of influence from Government was ‘potentially at risk’, he added.

‘We are almost being treated as if we are civil servants and distributing power and influence on behalf of the Government.

‘We are being described as ‘stakeholders’ in the criminal justice system.

‘Those who want to become judges have to sit exams and attend interviews where they have to spout political correctness like civil servants. We’ll soon have full inspections of judges.’

Peter Cuthbertson, director of the Centre for Crime Prevention said: ‘Judge Bray is absolutely right to point to how politicians restrict the courts’ ability to punish serious criminals.

‘Prison is the only sure way to protect the public from serious, repeat offenders, and the cost of more prison places is much lower than the cost of crimes they committed.’

‘Politicians should be encouraging judges to protect the public, not pushing them to be lenient towards criminals they know are a threat to others.’

The judge’s courtroom was infamous for its tough sentences, and local criminals spoke of being ‘Brayed’ by the judge.

Earlier this year he compared the UK’s borders to a ‘leaking sieve’ after he jailed an Albanian drug dealer who had been deported three times previously.
