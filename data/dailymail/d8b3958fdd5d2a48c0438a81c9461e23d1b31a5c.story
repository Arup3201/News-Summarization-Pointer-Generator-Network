It should have been the happiest day of their lives.

But this bride and groom - pictured just hours before they were marched away from their reception by police -  spent their first night of their married lives together behind bars, sleeping next to each other in adjoining cells.

Nick and Kirsty Bigland, nee Robinson, from Salford, were arrested at the Hilton Hotel in Manchester city centre on Saturday night following an alleged scuffle with security staff.

The couple had booked a room at the venue where they were due to be staying after they had celebrated their wedding party there.

But their evening was cut short, when Mr Bigland, 25, was arrested on suspicion of causing actual bodily harm.

Still
 wearing her white gown, his wife Mrs Bigland, 29,a mother-of-four, was 
detained on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence.

They were held overnight at a nearby police station and slept in neighbouring cells.

The
 newlyweds have since been released on bail and were keeping a low 
profile when approached at their home in Charlestown - with the groom 
declining to comment.
