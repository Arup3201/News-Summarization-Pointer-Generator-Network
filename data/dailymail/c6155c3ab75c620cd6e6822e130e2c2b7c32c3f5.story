Lorenzo Insigne's agent has shot down claims that Arsenal have made a move to sign the Italian winger.

Reports suggested the Gunners were ready to make a Â£20m bid for the 23-year-old, who has recently returned from the World Cup in Brazil following Italy's elimination.

But the diminutive playmaker's agent, Fabio Andreotti, has denied that Arsenal have made contact - but the Gunners are among a host of big clubs chasing Insigne.

Appeal: Italy star Lorenzo Insigne knows nothing of any interest from Arsenal, his agent says

'We have not been contacted by Arsenal for Lorenzo Insigne and Napoli has not notified us of this interest,' Andreotti said to Italian radio station Radio Crc.

'Lorenzo is a target of several European sides so it wouldn't surprise me if big clubs are interested in him.

'However, Napoli don't want to put him in the market.'

In demand: Insigne has been attracting interest from across Europe but Arsenal are yet to bid

Insigne was three years remaining on his deal at Napoli where he has spent his entire career - bar three loan spells at other Italian clubs.

Insigne scored eight goals in all competitions for Napoli last season as Rafa Benitez's men finished third in Serie A to secure Champions League qualification.

He scored twice in a 3-1 win over Fiorentina in the Coppa Italia final and has been attracting interest from clubs across Europe.
