A new biography of Louis van Gaal promises to ‘journey into the sinister recesses’ of the Manchester United manager’s character and, boy, does it do just that.

Extracts published on Tuesday detail him treating his second wife Truus in a shocking and humiliating manner brought on by drink, a former player describing the moment Van Gaal shouted at him so fiercely the boss's dentures fell out and how the Dutchman had a string of serious car accidents brought on by the exhaustion of being a full-time PE teacher and a semi-professional footballer.

It is the account of his relationship with Truus, who he married in 2008, which are most chilling.

‘The way he treats Truus in company is ungentlemanly and sometimes downright disgraceful,’ claims author Hugo Borst in O, Louis: In Search Of Louis van Gaal, serialised in The Times.

‘In the company of friends and acquaintances, Louis has made comments that in nine out of 10 marriages would have been grounds for divorce. People who have lunched or dined with Louis say alcohol does not have a favourable effect on him.

‘Of course he also has sweet things to say about his wife. "I have a lovely wife,” he said on German TV, “and the sex is good too.”'

Former AZ Alkmaar goalkeeper Khalid Sinouh – Van Gaal was manager of the Dutch side between 2005 and 2009 – reveals that his former boss refused to shake his players’ hand after a match unless they had won and also details an incident when Van Gaal thought his players were not training hard enough.

‘He had already b******ed me for it once but the second time he comes over and starts screaming at me something fierce and his dentures go flying.’

The Van Gaal story also has examples of warmth and class, like the time he and Truus visit a famous referee (in Holland) who is dying. Medical staff extended visiting hours due to the patient enjoying Van Gaal’s company so much. Three days later the match official passed away.

Borst also discovered that Van Gaal invested up to £150,000 with Dirk Scheringa, AZ’s flat broke chairman, in an astonishing display of generosity that some claimed naive in the extreme.

Van Gaal’s gritty pursuit of success is exemplified by his 180-mile-a-day drive between his home and Rotterdam, where he was a semi-professional player for Sparta. And the three serious car smashes which resulted.

Still not enough sinister recesses for you? How about Van Gaal buying a bigger, better and more expensive villa in Portugal just 100 yards from the one belonging to his sworn enemy Ronald Koeman, now also a manager in England at Southampton.

‘Childish perhaps but, to start with at least, this was something Van Gaal liked to boast about,’ writes Borst.

Let the countdown begin… Southampton host Van Gaal’s United on Monday December 8.
