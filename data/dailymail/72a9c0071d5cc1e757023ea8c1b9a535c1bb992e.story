Pin-point accuracy: The chocolate giant has hidden GPS tracking devices in the wrappers of six bars which activate when you open them

Should you open one of them, the GPS will activate and send a signal through to the company's control room.

A team of 'commandos' will then be despatched in a helicopter to your exact location within 24 hours and deliver you a briefcase containing £10,000 in cash.

To promote the campaign, Nestle has put up around 3,000 posters and produced a TV advert.

The commercial says they will 'scramble a crack team of highly trained individuals' to locate the owner of the lucky chocolate.

'They will board a helicopter, find the special bar and give the owner £10,000,' it adds.

According to Ad Week, Nestle believes the promotion 'will particularly appeal to men'.

The
GPS chips will be embedded in the wrappers of KitKat 4 Finger, KitKat 
Chunky, Aero Peppermint Medium and Yorkie Milk chocolate bars.
