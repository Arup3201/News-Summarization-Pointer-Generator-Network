The president of the Oxford Union has written an open letter to prospective speakers to encourage them to honour their engagements despite his arrest on suspicion of rape.

Ben Sullivan said: ‘This institution is bigger than its president,’ as he tried to prevent more damaging cancellations.

Sullivan, 21, was arrested in his rooms at Christ Church, Oxford in the early morning of May 7.

On Thursday Ben Sullivan must survive a vote of no-confidence against him

He was taken away for questioning, accused of raping a young woman and attempting to rape a second in separate attacks in the early part of last year.

Police released him on bail while they continued their investigation and the Oxford Union itself sidelined him and elected an acting president, only for Sullivan to return.

His decision to stay on led Interpol secretary general Ronald Noble to withdraw from an engagement this Friday.

In his letter, Sullivan argued: ‘The Union was founded on the principles of free speech and debate.

‘This core belief in the opportunity for everyone to put forward their point of view still represents the ultimate purpose of the institution.

‘This overarching principle remains more important than any individual speaker, any debate, and any president.’

He also offered to stand aside for the particular events if the speaker did not wish him to preside.

Referring to the criminal allegations, Sullivan said that on legal advice he could not give his side of the story or defend himself against the allegations at the present time.

‘I therefore feel the calls for my resignation are premature, especially given that no charges have been brought against me,’ he said, adding: ‘Should the situation change I will of course review my position.’

The letter was a response to one by Sarah Pine, the Oxford University Student Union vice president for women, and fellow student Helena Dollimore, urging prospective speakers to consider withdrawing from the planned debates.

Former American military commander General David Petreaus and singer Paloma Faith are among those due to attend the Union.

On Thursday Sullivan, a history and politics student on sabbatical from his studies during his Union duties, must survive a vote of no-confidence against him.

Sullivan was bailed to return to police on June 18. He has not been charged with any offence.
