Argentina made light work of Hong Kong in their second and final friendly of an Asian tour on Tuesday, with Gonzalo Higuain and Lionel Messi both scoring twice.

The Napoli striker enjoyed getting in behind an inexperienced defence and was helped by Messi once the Barcelona forward came on.

Nicolas Gaitan also grabbed a double, while Ever Banega opened the scoring in Hong Kong. 

Manchester United winger Angel di Maria was also involved, albeit as a late substitute.

Argentina bounced back from their disappointing 2-0 defeat to Brazil at the weekend, in which Messi missed a hat-trick.

Things are looking up again for the 27-year-old, who said the side were still getting used to Gerardo Martino's tactics.

'It is different to Alejandro Sabella,' he said. 

'We try to adapt quickly to what Tata wants to get right for the Copa America.'

Gerardo Martino was happy with the win despite the lowly opposition
