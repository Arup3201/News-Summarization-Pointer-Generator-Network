Utah has become the latest of an increasing number of U.S. states to bring in legislation against revenge porn.

Legal experts called the new legislation an 'important step', but noted that the law only protects against revenge porn published with intent to cause harm, leaving a loophole for third-party sites spreading the images.

Revenge porn is defined as sexually explicit images, initially shared with a partner, appearing online as ‘payback’, often after a relationship has ended.

Already outlawed in some form in Alaska, Idaho, Texas, California and New Jersey, several states including Maryland and Wisconsin are considering making the practice illegal.

The Substitute Distribution of Intimate Images was signed into Utah state law on Monday by Governor Gary Herbert.

It outlaws the publication of intimate images with intent to cause emotional stress or harm.

This means that the law covers person-on-person revenge, but does not make it illegal to run revenge porn websites where images are often tied to the person’s name, address and phone number.

To add insult to injury, it is not unheard of for revenge porn sites to offer 'reputation protection services' where they take the photographs or video down in return for money – essentially blackmail.

Loophole: Although the new Utah law protects against sharing intimate pictures published with the intention to cause harm, it does not protect against 'revenge porn websites'

As a result, Mary Anne Franks, a law professor at the University of Miami who is helping states draft revenge porn laws, said she was extremely disappointed with the law.

‘The harm [those webmasters] in fact cause victims is no less serious than the vengeful ex-partner,’ Professor Franks told Daily Dot.

‘This requirement gives people a free pass to ruin lives using sexually explicit images so long as they can plausibly argue they had some other motive other than harassment or causing distress.’

In an interview last year, Professor Franks explained further that sharing a nude picture with another person implies limited consent similar to other business transactions.

'If you give your credit card to a waiter, you aren't giving him permission to buy a yacht,' Prof. Franks said.

In California, where spurned lovers who post graphic images of an ex face prison sentence while those convicted of malicious intent could also be fined $1,000, a website owner has just been arrested after extorting thousands of dollars from his victims.

Fighting back: Several U.S. states now have some form of legislation against revenge porn, as well as countries like Australia and Israel

Kevin Bollaert has been charged with 31 offences pertaining to the publishing of 10,000 explicit photos that were sent in to a revenge porn website he ran.

And while it may be easy to dismiss revenge porn as a side-line issue, research from the University of Indiana recently showed that more than half (52.3 per cent) of young adults have engaged in 'unwanted but consensual sexting with a committed partner.'

The precise scope of the problem is unclear because many victims never come forward or are frequently turned away by the police.

Suing for civil damages is another option, but that, too, means hefty legal bills and the risk of provoking an unstable ex-partner.

The revenge porn-phenomenon is as border-less as the internet, and several countries have now introduced legislation against it.

In January this year, Australia and Israel passed against revenge porn, with

Knesset member Yifat Kariv, who introduced the law, called the phenomenon 'virtual rape'.
