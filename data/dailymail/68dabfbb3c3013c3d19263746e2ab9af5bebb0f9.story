'A dog is for life, not just for Christmas' is the saying coined by the Dogs Trust 35 years ago to stop people buying puppies on a whim during the festive season, only to give them up halfway through the new year when they realised they couldn't handle the responsibility.

But these newborn four puppies didn't even make it to Boxing Day before being abandoned.

Luckily, however, they were found before it was too late, discovered huddling up together in a battered old shoe box around the back of a branch of Lidl the supermarket in Canterbury, Kent.

Found by a member of the public, the two girls and two boys have now been taken in by the Dog's Trust and been named after pantomime characters to mark the season in which they were born: Prince Charming, Cinderella, Snow White and Buttons.

'They were found early morning around the back of Lidl's. We know absolutely nothing about the owner. It could be an unplanned litter or a breeder who has failed to sell them'

The crossbreed puppies were initially taken to the vet to check over before being taken in by the charity, and are now recovering well from the ordeal.

Dogs Trust Canterbury Rehoming Centre manager, Adam Levy, said: 'It really is a  bit of a miracle that the puppies survived after being so callously dumped in  the cold at such a young age.

'We think the puppies were one or two days old  when they were dumped. They have been in our care for a week now and their eyes  still aren't open.

'They were found early morning around the back of Lidl's. We know absolutely  nothing about the owner. It could be an unplanned litter or a breeder who has  failed to sell them.

'Our centre looks after thousands of abandoned and unwanted dogs every year,  but it still shocks us to think that someone could just abandon these helpless  puppies without a care if they lived or died.

'They will have to be hand reared for the next three weeks. This takes a lot of  care and at the moment it is being shared out between four of the staff.'

The puppies have been hand-reared by Dogs Trust staff since Christmas

'The biggest problem is that they learn so much from their mums, like how to deal with other dogs. We can't replace that but we will put them with a mother figure in the future'

Staff will bottle-feed the puppies every hour throughout the night to give them  the best possible chance of survival but things are looking good for the  crossbreed pups.

Mr Levy said: 'Their behaviour was slightly difficult at first but they have  settled down now and are becoming used to human contact. It is always touch and  go with pups at this age but they're all feeding well.

'The biggest problem is that they learn so much from their mums, like how to  deal with other dogs. We can't replace that but we will put them with a mother  figure in the future.

'It's hard to tell what breed they are. They have brown patches which look like  they could be part Jack Russell but they also look quite Staffy. What we do  know is that they are crossbreeds and it will probably become clearer as they  grow.'

The puppies are not out of danger yet but things are looking positive for their  recovery. Dogs Trust Canterbury will continue to care for the canine casualties  until they are ready to find loving new homes in the coming months.

Dogs Trust CEO, Clarissa Baldwin, said: 'This year sees the 35th anniversary of  Dogs Trust's iconic slogan "A dog is for life, not just for Christmas", and  sadly it's as true today as when it was first coined.

'Every year we see a  number of dogs handed into our rehoming centres in the days and weeks around  Christmas when the appeal of a cute puppy has worn off.

'It seems that people are still giving puppies as Christmas presents without  considering the long term ramifications. Dogs can provide a world of happiness  and enjoyment, and we urge anyone considering a new addition to the family to  think it through properly and care for the dogs for its' entire life.'

She added: 'These little puppies are now in excellent hands at Dogs Trust Canterbury who  will do all they can to ensure a suitable and loving home is found for them'  Dogs Trust cares for over 16,000 stray and abandoned dogs each year for a  variety of reasons, including those that have become unwanted gifts.

Staff will be working around the clock looking after the 1,500 dogs that are  based in their 18 rehoming centres across the UK and one in Dublin at any one  time.
