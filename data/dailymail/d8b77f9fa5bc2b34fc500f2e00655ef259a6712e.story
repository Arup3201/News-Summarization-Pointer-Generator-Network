German car giant Volkswagen is to recall tens of thousands of cars in the UK – including those carrying Audi, Skoda and SEAT badges - because of problems with faulty gearboxes which cause a loss of power while driving.

Thousands more are being recalled because of fuse problems which cause lights to cut out.

It is part of a worldwide recall of more than 2.6million cars because of a variety of technical problems.

Some 30,000 of the cars being recalled in Britain, including the popular Golf model, are fitted with a 7-speed gearbox.

It also affects cars from the wider ‘Volkswagen Group’ – including those badged as Audis, Skoda, and SEAT – which also have the same gearbox.

Some 1.6million cars and vans are to be recalled globally over problems with a gearbox which leads to a loss of power.

Volkswagen says it will replace the hi-tech synthetic oil used in seven-speed dual-clutch gearboxes with traditional mineral oil.

This follows evidence that gearboxes in hot and humid areas such as in China and South-East Asia are susceptible to electrical faults in stop-start traffic.

As a result, Volkswagen issued a global voluntary recall for all cars fitted with the seven-speed drives.

In addition, 30,000 VW Tiguans are being recalled in the UK because of a problem with fuses which cause headlights to cut out (file picture)

Drivers in Australia have campaigned vociferously for some months over the problem after motorists lost power.

Volkswagen said it was not aware of cases of drivers losing power in Britain.

The company said it was seeking exact details of models affected.

In addition, 30,000 Volkswagen Tiguans are being recalled in the UK because of a problem with fuses which cause headlights to cut out.

Globally, the recall includes 800,000 Volkswagen Tiguans built between 2008 and 2011.

The company said an electrical fuse failure may cause lighting failures on several different circuits.

Around 250,000 pick-ups are also being recalled for repairs to the fuel system to prevent leaks.

The recall is one of the biggest in VW's history.

On the gearbox fault, a  Volkswagen spokesman at the car giant’s headquarters in Wolfsburg, Northern Germany said: 'It has been discovered that, with vehicles with a 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox (DQ200), electric malfunctions could occur in the gearbox power supply if synthetic gearbox oil is used.

‘This applies in particular if the vehicle is subject to a hot and humid climate, coupled with a high proportion of stop and go driving.’

He added: ‘Studies have established that using mineral oil will rectify this problem.

'To continue to ensure customer satisfaction among DSG [dual-clutch gearboxes], Volkswagen has decided to launch global voluntary campaign and to request all customers with a 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox (DQ200) filled with synthetic oil to visit a workshop for an oil exchange.

'The vehicle owners will be informed by Volkswagen accordingly.’

Some 640,000 of the cars are being recalled in China, where Volkswagen produces cars for the local market, as well as selling imports.

China is now the biggest car market in the world, an important source of demand for global carmakers looking for growth to offset declines in European car sales.

Volkswagen says it wants to double its manufacturing capacity in China to 4million cars a year by 2018, helping it to become the biggest car company in the world by sales.

However, the size of Volkswagen’s global recall is dwarfed by Toyota's recall of 10million cars in 2009 and 2010, amid accident fears over sticky accelerator pedals and floor mats.

Chas Hallett, editor in chief of consumer magazine What Car? said: ‘This is a big recall for sheer volumes of cars.

‘But recalls happen all the time in the car industry and they're always done for safety or reliability issues.'

Mr Hallett added: 'In the end, it won't harm Volkswagen and if you're an owner of one of the cars, as long as you get the work done as soon as possible, there's nothing to worry about.’
