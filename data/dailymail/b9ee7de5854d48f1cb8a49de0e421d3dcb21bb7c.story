It appears Bayern Munich's stars are equally adept with a ball in their hand as they are at their feet.

Players including Thomas Muller, David Alaba and Bastian Schweinsteiger enjoyed a game of basketball at the club's regeneration unit on Wednesday morning following Tuesday night's frustrating 1-1 draw at home to Schalke.

The trio were joined by fellow team-mates Javi Martinez, Juan Bernat and Mitchell Weiser as the sextuplet were all smiles as they embarked in a light-hearted game of shooting hoops.

The brief change of sports might be what the German giants need after a stuttering resumption to their season since the winter break.

Tuesday's Bundesliga draw at the Allianz Arena comes after Friday night's shock 4-1 thrashing at Wolfsburg.

The two results leaves the 2013 Champions League winners winless this year with one point from a possible six.

After going unbeaten during the first half of the season, Bayern now sit eight points ahead of their Friday night conquerers after 19 games.

Talismanic winger Arjen Robben is not just worried that Bayern back-to-back blips so far in this year may have opened the door for Wolfsburg in the title race, but that they could be made to pay for poor form in Europe too.

The Holland international told FIFA.com that the Bavarian side won't be able to get away with such lapses shown in their last two games in the Champions League, where their campaign recommences against Shakhtar Donetsk in the last 16 first leg later this month.

'We controlled the game with a man down, but the Schalke result is annoying,' the 31-year-old said after scoring their opener on Tuesday.

'Of course, we played with ten men for most of the match, but when you go 1-0 up and then let them equalise, conceding a goal like that can be deadly in the Champions League.'
