As New Year's Eve approaches, so does the prospect of the dreaded next-day hangover.

But from Victoria Beckham's bee pollen smoothies to Miranda Kerr crediting South East Asian noni juice for her flawless complexion, it seems there is more to treating a delicate head and sensitive stomach than relying on a fry-up and hair of the dog.

We've asked holistic nutritionist Nikki Baker to sort the quinoa from the chaff and talk us through the new superfoods expected to be big in 2015 - and how they'll help us on the morning after.

Ingredient: Moringa

Celebrity fans: Lily Cole and Livia Firth

Best for: Liver protection and blood sugar regulation

Most popular in powder form, this superfood is made from the leaf of the moringa ‘miracle' tree, native to Africa and Asia and one of the most nutrient-dense plants on the planet.

It has been claimed that it boosts immunity, lowers blood pressure, alleviates stress, fights fatigue, improves digestive health and increases libido. And that's just on the inside. It's also a tonic for hair, nails and skin.

So what makes moringa so miraculous? It contains almost 25 per cent protein, including all nine of the essential amino acids, which are important for the body's key functions and help maintain healthy skin cells.

It is also packed with essential vitamins and minerals, including skin-supporting vitamins such as zinc, which includes strong, supple healthy skin, nails and hair among its beauty benefits.

Nikki Baker advises: 'Moringa has six times the antioxidant content of the popular superfood, goji berries. It contains over 90 nutrients, 46 antioxidants and abundant minerals. 

'Gram for gram, Moringa contains more vitamin B12 than steak, more vitamin A than eggs, and more calcium than milk.

'Its antioxidants detox and protect the liver, boost immunity and support healthy blood sugar levels.'

Ingredient: Mushrooms

High profile fans: Kelly Osbourne and Katy Perry

Best for: Adrenal recovery and digestion

According to Nikki, mushrooms are big news for 2015. But these aren’t the kind of fungi you’ll find in the veg section of the supermarket. 

These medicinal mushrooms have powerful antioxidant properties that can help bring you back on track following a heavy night.

One such example is chaga, a hard black fungus which has been central to folk medicine in northern climates for centuries and is dubbed the mushroom of immortality in Siberia.

Nikki said: 'Chaga is a nutrient-rich medicinal mushroom, it grows on the birch tree and so harnesses the amazing nutrient properties of this tree. 

Some mushrooms have digestion-calming properties - important after a big night out

'Chaga contains numerous B vitamins, flavonoids, minerals and enzymes. 

'It is also one of the world’s densest sources of pantothenic acid, an  essential nutrient needed by the adrenal glands as well as digestive organs.'

Ingredient: Chlorella

High profile fans: Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Miranda Kerr, Millie Mackintosh

Best for: Liver detoxification and healthy protein delivery

We’ve all seen supermodels sipping on green juices containing chlorella this year but as Nikki stresses, there’s more to this trend than just a fad, especially when it comes to the morning after.

The one to look out for, she says, is Sun Chlorella A, a green algae and superfood detoxifier, popular in Japan.

In 1996, research from Sapporo Medical University, Japan, suggested that chlorella, a freshwater green algae, can lessen hangover symptoms by up to 96 per cent if taken before drinking.

The idea is that the antioxidant-packed algae neutralises the free radicals (chemicals that damage cells) in alcohol. 

Chlorella - which also contains iron, folic acid and energy-boosting B vitamins - is also lauded for its gut-soothing properties, as it dissolves and expands to coat the stomach when eaten.

Fans include Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, who adds it to her daily green juice, along with Miranda Kerr, Victoria Beckham and Millie Mackintosh, to name a few.

Grown in the Amazon Rainforest and the high Andes mountains of Peru, nut-like sacha inchi seeds are even thought to  aid weight loss

Ingredient: Sacha inchi

High profile fans: Dr Mehmet Oz

Best for: Protein-filled morning after snacks

After a festive night out, it can be tempting to spend the next day grazing on high fat foods to feel better. 

But as Nikki explains, there’s a much healthier alternative to fill the stomach - sacha inchi seeds.

Speaking about the peanut-like seed, she said: 'One of the richest sources in the world of omega fatty acids, sacha Inchi are also loaded with protein, fibre and antioxidants. 

'In the Amazon Rainforest in Peru, the ingredient has been cultivated by indigenous people for centuries.' 

U.S. television host Dr Mehmet Oz also included sacha inchi on his list of Best and Worst of 2010 - Your Guide as the best weight-loss snack.

He claimed that they are loaded with vitamin E, omega-3s fatty acids and have anti-inflammatory properties that can attack stomach fat.

If you're looking to carry on the celebrations but still want to reap the benefits of superfoods, Europe's first  bar dedicated to superfood cocktails has opened its doors and the new range of tasty tipples may even hinder a hangover.

Tanya's Cafe, located within the MyHotel in Chelsea, was the brainchild of raw food specialist and wellness coach, Tanya Maher.

Speaking to FEMAIL about her bar, which mixes organic spirits with only superfoods and cold-pressed juices, Tanya said: 'The menu is designed to reflect your busy schedule and provide loving nourishment at all times of the day.

'You can get your morning green juice, which is cold pressed and organic or a pour-over coffee with hazelnut milk, a satisfyingly delicious plant-based burger and decadent raw chocolate cake for lunch. 

'Then come evening you could share a vibrant cashew cheese platter and superfood-packed cocktails, that are made with only top quality, vegan and ethically sourced alcohol.

'Everything is organic, hand picked and raw.'

One of her most popular requests is a drink called What The Doctor Ordered, a combination of vodka, lemon, beetroot, carrot, sweet potato, raw honey, ginger, lavender and chia seeds.

Another cocktail on offer includes a combination of walnut-infused vodka, fresh cherries, cacao powder (packed with antioxidants and magnesium), acai berry (used by athletes for stamina), vanilla bitters and maple syrup.

There's also a tipple full of the sugar cane spirit cachaca shaken up with lime, coconut palm sugar and maca powder (from a Peruvian root), well known for its energy-boosting properties.

So are the cocktails, which cost around £10, too good to be true?

Tipper Lewis, Head Herbalist at Neal’s Yard Remedies, said: 'Promoting good health while drinking alcohol may seem counterproductive, however by adding superfoods to the mix it offers a revolutionary healthy spin on some of our most celebratory drinks.

'By using superfoods, the most nutrient-dense ingredients nature has to offer, you can transform even the most empty calorie cocktails into health-boosting mixtures packed full of antioxidants, minerals and vitamins.

'There are superfoods for every season, and the accessibility of superfoods makes these cocktails readily available for even the novice bartender. 

'Since there is always an in-season option, finding innovative ingredients with health giving benefits for cocktails is a breeze.'
