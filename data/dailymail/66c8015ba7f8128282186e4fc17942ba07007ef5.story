A loud noise heard near the Los Angeles home of embattled 7th Heaven star Stephen Collins sparked a suicide scare Tuesday night, which turned out to be a false alarm. 

Officer Jane Kim, with the LAPD, told MailOnline that 'someone from the media' placed a 911 call at 6.45pm pacific time about what sounded like a single gunshot fired inside a house in the 5100 block of Chimineas Avenue in the LA suburb of Tarzana.

Officers responded to the area and cordoned off the block to investigate the report.

Collins' neighbor, former Baywatch star and Playboy model Donna D'Errico, tweeted just after 8pm pacific time that the actor had shot himself.

'That's all I know,' she wrote in a follow-up tweet. 'The police have the street cordoned off and aren't even letting residents in..'

She then shared a photo showing police cars and emergency vehicles behind a yellow crime scene tape.

A short time later, the gossip site TMZ reported that Collins was not home and did not take his life.

Sources directly connected to the actor told TMZ he has been communicating with them all night.

According to NBC News, LAPD made contact with Collins via Facetime to make sure he was alive and well. 

D’Errico later deleted the tweet about Collins' suicide and apologized for repeating what her neighbors had told her. 

In bombshell divorce documents obtained by MailOnline on Tuesday, Collins' wife, Faye Grant, claimed the actor used his celebrity status to prey on underage girls and ‘engender the trust of the families of the children he molested’ in a decade of abuse.

Devastated Faye also revealed Collins was treated for a sex addiction and was seeing a ‘sexual dysfunction’ therapist, but he refused to seek proper help or hospitalization for his ‘predilection towards children’, she said.

In bombshell divorce documents obtained by MailOnline, Faye Grant claims her husband Stephen used his celebrity status to prey on underage girls and ‘engender the trust of the families of the children he molested’ in a decade of abuse

The actor who played Pastor Eric Camden, the virtuous father on long-running family drama 7th Heaven, is allegedly under investigation for child molestation.

In the court filings Faye said she first learned of Collins' 'illness' in the presence of his therapist in January, 2012 – after 27 years of marriage.

And according to the papers she spent 20 months coping with the trauma of his alleged abuse on children and worrying about her 'moral and legal responsibility'.

She said: 'Obviously I am sickened by Stephen's actions. I have urged Stephen multiple times to seek proper treatment for pedophilia.

'I am particularly afraid of what may happen if he does not seek treatment, because he may be working or interacting with children in connection with his employment.'

Tapes of Collins' confession given during a marriage therapy session emerged in the past 24 hours.

In the tapes, obtained by TMZ, Collins admits that he exposed himself to several young girls between the ages of 11 and 13.

The NYPD is now reportedly investigating the claims Collins had 'inappropriate sexual contact' with 'at least three' minor victims.

The 67-year-old actor allegedly made a written confession to his now ex-wife Faye Grant in 2012, which sparked the therapy session.

Grant secretly recorded the session under the advisement of her lawyer, who told her it was legal in California to record conversations in order to gather evidence on a person who has committed a violent felony.

In the recording, a man with Collins' distinct voice admits exposing himself to an 11-year-old relative of his first wife Marjorie Weinman. Collins and Weinman divorced in 1978.

He also confessed to touching the young relative.

'There was one moment of touching where her hand...I put her her hand on my penis,' Collins says.

Collins is best known for his role as Pastor Eric Camden, patriarch of the do-gooder Camden clan, on long-running drama 7th Heaven. Last month he tweeted this photo of a cast reunion dinner attended by his foremr co-star Jessica Biel, center

That incident of molestation was actually reported in 2012, and can still be prosecuted since the statute of limitations starts at the date of reporting.

In the divorce documents Faye says Collins’ therapist subsequently disclosed to her that her husband has ‘narcissistic personality disorder with sociopathic tendencies.

She said: ‘In the presence of his therapist, Stephen admitted that he has engaged in a long term pattern of sexually abusing minor children, including sexually molesting three young girls over a decade ago…I believe that there have been other victims, but he has thus far only confessed to those girls.’

Faye said that one of the victims Collins confessed to molesting lives in Los Angeles and the other two were in New York.

She said: ‘The two New York victims were apparently molested over the course of several years, from the ages of 10 to 14 years old.

Papers: Both Collins and Grant listed their separation date as February 1, 2012 in their initial divorce filings back in May of 2012 (above)

Bombshell: In November of 2013, Grant filed papers again since the divorce was taking too long to be finalized, where she revealed having learned of Collins' illness and asking that any legal liability Collins might have would not come out of her pocket

'My understanding is that all three of these victims are now over the age of 26.’

She said it is her understanding that there is currently an open investigation with the New York City Special Victims Unit with respect to one of the victims who filed a sexual assault claim against Collins in November, 2012.

‘Again I had no knowledge of Stephen’s secret life until January 2012. I heard accounts of Stephen’s secret life from Stephen’s therapist, his sister-in-law, his sister-in-law’s husband, and Stephen himself.’

Faye says she never witnessed any of the abuse first hand and never suspected her husband was abusing children.

She added: ‘After Stephen admitted to molesting the three young girls, I reported his acts to the police in both Los Angeles County and New York City.’

The couple were married for 27 years before Faye first learned that her husband had been 'engaging in a long term patterns of sexually molesting children', according to court documents.

Collins starred alongside Whoopi Goldberg in the 1985 romantic comedy Jumpin' Jack Flash

In January 2012, Stephen admitted abusing three underage girls over a decade earlier - two of whom he molested over a period of several years.

One victim filed a report with authorities in New York City.

In December 2012, Faye received letters and a phone call from the furious husband of one of the victims, angry at Faye for not turning Stephen over to police.

The husband threatened to bring a civil lawsuit against Faye for Stephen's actions.

Faye has now taken legal action to ensure that Stephen is held solely liable for his crimes and pay compensation for the damage he has done to her.

She said in her statement: 'I am also afraid of the potential consequences that Stephen's behavior may have for me, including risking my reputation and livelihood.

'I also fear that I may potentially face civil (or even criminal) liability for Stephen's actions.'
