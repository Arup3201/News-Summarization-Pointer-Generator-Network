Killed: Bruna Gobbi, 18, died swimming at Boa Viagem beach in Brazil

A drowning Brazilian teenager was attacked by a shark just seconds before she was rescued by lifeguards.

Bruna Gobbi, 18, died after swimming at Boa Viagem beach in the northeastern Brazil city of Recife on Monday.

The shark attacked her left leg as she tried to keep her head above water.

The teenager from Sao Paulo, was rushed to the Restauracao hospital in Recife but she later died.

A  hospital official who asked not to be named said Bruni had 'lost a lot of blood' and died of her injuries after her leg was amputated.

Lifeguards spotted Burni and her cousin Daniele Gobbi were in trouble and immediately responded on Monday afternoon.

The local government's security cameras captured the attack and rescue on video.

Two lifeguards swam out to her, while a third sped ahead on a jetski.

As they approached the pair a sudden flurry of movement created a splash around Bruni
followed by a pool of red around her.

She was dragged back to shore and given treatment before being taken to hospital but she later died.

'The rescuers came in a matter of five minutes, but to us it felt like 
five years, Daniele Gobbi, told Globo TV.

'We knew there were risks of a shark attack but I thought this would occur in a deeper sector,' she added.

A
total of 58 shark attacks, 28 of them fatal, have been reported over 
the past 21 years in Recife, one the most popular seaside resorts in the
northeastern state of Pernambuco, according to a state agency that has 
been tracking shark attacks since 1922, reported AFP.
