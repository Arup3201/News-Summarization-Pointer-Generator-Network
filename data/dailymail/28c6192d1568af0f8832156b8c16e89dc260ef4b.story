As a young nurse Nina Cordelli has already helped save lives, but nothing that could have prepared her for meeting the women she saved by donating her bone marrow.

The surprise – and very emotional meeting - between donor Cordelli and grateful recipient Cathy Nadaud occurred at the Jewish Hospital’s annual Partners in Hope Reunion in Mason, Ohio on May 10.

Cordelli joined the National Bone Marrow Donor registry in 2011 when she helped coordinate a drive while in nursing school.

‘The statistic they gave me was that there was a less than one percent chance I would ever be matched with anybody who needed a transplant,’ said Cordelli, now 23, while being interviewed on stage at the event.

But only eight months later, she was discovered to be a near-perfect match for 60-year-old Springdale grandmother and teacher Nadaud, reports Cincinnatti.com.

She had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia and was told that a bone marrow transplant was her only chance for survival.

As Cordelli spoke about her experience, Nadaud sat in the audience and slowly realized that the composed young woman on stage was her savior.

By the time Cordelli had finished talking, Nadaud was already making her way to the stage for an emotional meeting with the woman of whom she owed so much.

The two women embraced, tears welling up in their eyes and Nadaud told Cordelli that she wasn’t what she had envisioned from their letters.

The Be The 
Match registry connects patients with bone marrow donor matches.

There 
are two ways to join:
• Sign up online at www.bethematch.org
• Sign up a local marrow recruitment drive

Applicants must be between 18 and 60, 
willing to donate to any patient in need and meet health guidelines.

Registration, which is free, involves completing a health history form 
and giving a swab of cheek cells.

‘I owe her everything,’ said a tearful Nadaud. ‘I owe her my life, and what more can you owe somebody than your life?’

Naudaud also paid tribute to Cordelli’s thoughtfulness to volunteer at such a young age.

Nadaud jokes that at 21 she had been more concerned about going out to bars than helping others in need.

‘You are an angel,’ she said.

For Nadaud, Cordelli was her last chance of a cure. She had been diagnosed with leukemia in 2008. Then two weeks before she was due to have surgery her initial transplant fell through and she was forced to undergo four rounds of chemotherapy.

By May 2009 she was in remission and then two years later she celebrated a cancer-free milestone, but not long afterwards was told that it had returned.

That’s when the registry turned up Cordelli, now a nurse at a Pittsburgh hospital.

Just before Thanksgiving 2011, Cordelli underwent a two-hour procedure in which doctors drilled four holes into her hip area and punctured the bone, harvesting a liter of bone marrow.

A day later, the bag containing Cordelli’s cells were infused into Nadaud, who prayed the last-chance procedure would work.

‘My daughter-in-law was pregnant with my third grandbaby and I thought, “I want to see that baby,”’ she said.

Nadaud and Cordelli couldn’t meet until at least a year following the transplant – standard procedure for medical donations. At first they corresponded via anonymous letters, calling each other ‘donor’ and ‘recipient.’

One of Nadaud's letter read: 'Dear donor: Words cannot express the gratitude my family and I feel for you. What an unselfish act from one so young. You have given me a second chance at life and the potential to see my precious grandchildren grow up. ... You are an angel. Sincerely, your Recipient.'

Now cancer-free, Nadaud says she’s looking forward to retiring this year and spending time with her three grandchildren and family.
