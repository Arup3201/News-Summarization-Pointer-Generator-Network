Snack tactics: Knowing where to order your french fries can make all the difference to your waistline

Whether loaded with chili and cheese, or served simply with lashings of salt, the humble french fry is undoubtedly America's favourite deep-fried treat.

But knowing where to order the popular snack can make all the difference to your waistline, as a new book reveals that servings can vary wildly in terms of fat and calorie content.

Researchers for Eat This, Not That! 2013: The No-Diet Weight Loss Solution found that one portion can differ by as many as 1,200 calories.

McDonald's french fries were 
surprisingly among the healthiest on offer at 230 calories and 11g of 
fat per small serving, however a plate of Chili's
 Texas Cheese Fries with Chili and Ranch is a serious diet-buster at 
2,150 calories, with a staggering 144g of fat and 6,080mg sodium.

Loaded
 fries aren't all bad though - if yours aren't complete without a layer 
of melted cheese, then head to Steak 'n' Shake instead, where a small Bacon Cheese French Fries comes in at a rather less terrifying 360 calories and 20g fat.

Thicker-cut steak fries are the safest way to play it on a restaurant menu, the Eat This Not That team reveals, as the higher ratio of potato to oil cuts the fat content down significantly.

That does not appear to be the case at TGI Friday's though, as the chain's Parmesan Steak Fries have almost double the fat of its regular fries at 49g and 660 calories.

Instead, choose KFC's potato wedges, at 290 calories and 15g of fat, just 2.5g of which is saturated.

Men's Health editor-in-chief David Zinczenko, who is 
behind the Eat This Not That series, told MailOnline 
that the trick to having your fries and eating them is to exercise 
moderation.

'The occasional order of fries isn’t so bad, but most people treat 
deep-fried potatoes like a food group,' he said.

'One out of every six restaurant 
orders comes with fries, and more than 50per cent of American potatoes 
pass through a deep fryer before being sold. When researchers look at 
the effect of this, it becomes clear that there’s a direct connection 
between french fries and weight gain.'

The new guide also compared sweet potato fries, which many might believe is a healthier alternative.

The exact opposite is the case at the Cheesecake Factory, however, where a portion of sweet potato fries is 400 calories more than its regular fries.

FAST FOOD FRIES

McDonald’s is awfully proud of its fries. So proud, in fact, that the 
chain bought the rights to be the exclusive fry purveyor at the Olympic 
Games in London. And perhaps it should be proud - the spuds taste great 
and they have fewer calories than any other fast food chain’s. Five Guys
 is also proud of its fries, but that pride manifests itself in 
elephantine portions that threaten to tip your table and will most 
certainly tip your bathroom scale. Make your choice accordingly.

WORST: Five Guys Fries (large)

LOADED FRIES

Let’s be frank: topping fries with cheese, ranch, bacon, gravy, sour 
cream, or any similar high-fat accoutrement is the kind of innovation 
that turns skinny people chubby. But if you have a hankering you can’t 
control, just remember to keep the portion in check. Fortunately Steak 'n Shake gives you that option: Order the chain’s small over the loaded 
fries at Chili’s and you’ll eliminate 1,790 calories.

STEAK FRIES

Wedges tend to be a smarter option: You pack more soft potato inside 
each greasy exterior, which ultimately leads to fewer calories for the 
same amount of food. But that doesn’t mean you don’t still have to 
consider portion size. Opt for KFC’s over TGI’s and you’ll cut the 
calories by more than half.

WORST: TGI Friday's Parmesan Steak Fries

SWEET POTATO FRIES

Think you’re saving yourself calories by opting for sweet potatoes over 
standard spuds? Think again.

A side of The Cheesecake Factory’s fries 
will run you 400 calories more than their regular fries and stick 
you with nearly 50 percent more carbohydrates than a can of Pringles.

Switch to Burger King’s fries and you’ll cut more than two-thirds of the
 calories.

CURLY FRIES

Its menu once clotted with trans fats, Jack in the Box has made a 
concerted effort in recent years to cut down on dangerous oils. What 
remains is a dramatically improved side dish lineup, including your best
 option for a novelty fry. Arby’s, on the other hand, seasons every 
order with more than half a teaspoon of salt.
