First CNN, now Current TV.

Former New York state governor Eliot Spitzer is on his way out the door from another television gig - this time due to changes at the top as Middle Eastern media giant Al Jazeera finalizes its deal to buy Al Gore’s Current TV channel for $500 million.

Spitzer 'has chosen to step back from hosting,' and will no longer appear on his show ‘Viewpoint,’ a Current spokeswoman said on Sunday.

The disgraced politician turned liberal television host confirmed the news, noting that his professional relationship was with the station’s co-founders and not Al Jazeera, which is owned by the country Qatar.

Current TV’s mission will be different going forward, he said, emphasizing that the channel’s new owners will focus more on international newscasts rather than liberal analysis of the news.

‘I view Al Jazeera as a very serious journalistic outfit,’ Spitzer, 53, said. ‘They have proven to observers around the world that they are serious and objective.’

His 8pm talk show was the highlight of Current’s fledgling prime-time schedule, according to New York Times TV reporter Brian Stelter.

Last winter Current Media’s co-founders Al Gore and Joel Hyatt asked Spitzer to take over the channel’s after-dinner slot as its host at that time, Keith Olbermann, was about to be fired.

Their offer came right after Time Warner announced its cancellation of Spitzer’s CNN talk show ‘In the Arena’ and put Anderson Cooper in his 8pm spot.

Sudden career changes are all too familiar to the former politician, known for his attacks against Wall Street before he became known for his illegal affair with call girl Ashley Alexandra Dupré.

In 2008 Spitzer resigned from his role as New York governor soon after news broke of his liaison with the high-priced prostitute and aspiring pop artist who was 22 at the time.

In 2009 Spitzer returned to Washington D.C. as an investor in commercial real estate.

That same year he joined the City College of New York as an adjunct instructor of political science.

He then got into the media racket making appearances on HBO’s Real Time with Bill Maher and MSNBC.

Spitzer’s Current TV gig was never meant to be a full-time job. His contract with the channel ended after the presidential election in November.

Big changes: Al Jazeera says it plans to restructure the company entirely, and launch its own New York-based news channel Al Jazeera America using Current's distribution network

Until further notice ‘Viewpoint’ will be hosted by John Fugelsang, an actor and comedian who has been a frequent commentator and host on Current, the company spokeswoman told MailOnline.

Al Jazeera did not return requests for comments about Spitzer’s departure.

The Qatar-owned media conglomerate previously said it plans to restructure the company entirely, and launch its own New York-based news channel Al Jazeera America using Current's distribution network.

Al Jazeera has said that the progressive talk shows on Current would continue for about three months before changes are put into effect.

However, two other Current hosts, the former Michigan governor Michigan Jennifer Granholm and California’s lieutenant governor Gavin Newsom, recently announced plans to leave the company within the next few weeks.

Gore and Hyatt founded their liberal media brand as INdTV Holdings in 2002 and re-launched it as Current Media LLC in 2005. The company is presently based in San Francisco, California.

Al Jazeera announced that it had purchased the company on Wednesday, January 2.

Time Warner Cable, America’s second-largest television operator, dropped Current from its roster after the deal was confirmed, saying the network didn't have enough viewers.

As he says goodbye to Current, Spitzer is holding onto his job as a recurring guest on NY1’s political talk show ‘Inside City Hall,’ which he started in July.

Washington insiders say he is quietly making a transition back into politics, this time on the national level, according to the New York Post.
