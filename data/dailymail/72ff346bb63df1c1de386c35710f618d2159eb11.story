Almost 40 years ago, the 20th century's most influential sub-culture was born.

Today, hip hop is a way of life that dominates fashion, music, art, dance and advertizing.

It is a far cry from the humble beginnings of experimental rap, graffiti, and break-dancing in the run-down areas of 1970s New York City, which sparked a revolution.

Watching from the sidelines were photographers Janette Beckman, Joe Conzo and Martha Cooper.

And now, their glimpses inside the seminal years between 1977 and 1990 will be put on show at the Museum Of The City Of New York.

The series charts early performances of the Cool Crush Brothers in the early 1980s, and impromptu breakdances on the streets of Manhattan.

In one shot DJ Kool Herc, who is widely credited with creating hip hop by fusing the violent Bronx culture with early disco, stares down the barrel of the lens from behind tinted, wide-rimmed sunglasses.

Other key figures are seen posing for their first photo shoots, including the members of Boogie Down Productions, a hip hop group from the Bronx which masterminded a fusion of dancehall and reggae.

Big Daddy Kane, one of the most revered rappers in history who found fame with the Juice Crew in 1986, exhibits the archetypal haircut for hip hop fans during his hey day of 1988.

Afrika Bambaataa, who pioneered electro funk, poses for London-born photographer Janette Beckman in front of a graffiti-strewn brick wall in 1983, in a nod to the street roots of the movement. 

And Queen Latifah, who made waves by rapping about domestic violence in 1990, also makes an appearance.

Later photos show the colorful album covers produced for girl band Salt N Pepa and Busta Rhymes.

The exhibition will run from April 1 to September 15.
