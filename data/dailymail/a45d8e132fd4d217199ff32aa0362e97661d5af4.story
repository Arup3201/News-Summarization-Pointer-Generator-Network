Married police officer Christopher Semak (above), who had sex with a 14-year-old girl, has been jailed for six years

A married police officer who had sex with a 14-year-old girl after sending her text messages saying he would be as 'bad as the paedophiles I am trying to catch' was jailed for six years today.

West Midlands Police said Christopher Semak, an officer in south Birmingham, carried out the crimes between April 2010 and November 2011 when the girl, who was known to the man, was aged 14 and 15.

The 33-year-old officer was arrested on January 24, 2012 at his Kings Norton home - on the same day the girl, then aged 16, revealed that she had been systematically assaulted over the course of two years, police said.

Stafford Crown Court heard 18 encounters between the pair took place in Semak’s car while his young child was in the front seat.

Afterwards the girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, would write in her diary about their sexual exploits.

Semak was handed the prison sentence following a four-week trial.

The court heard the girl's parents discovered what was going on after they found more than 200 messages from Semak on her phone.

They then asked their daughter about the messages, and she admitted having a relationship with the officer.

Two days later, the victim’s parents are said to have confronted Semak who simply said: 'I have been stupid.'

On January 21, the girl confided in a teacher, who then contacted Children’s Services and police.

In a police interview three days later, she told officers that she and Semak had began flirting in March 2010.

She also said Semak said to her, 'Can you not tell anyone I’ve been texting you because it does look a bit weird, a 30-year-old that’s texting a 14-year-old'.

Another follow-up text message read to the court added: 'Of course I want to, but if we did things and it got out I’d lose my job, my family and go to prison because you’re only 14. I think we should leave it till you’re old enough.'

He later added in another text: 'I can’t do this with you being so young, it would make me as bad as a paedophile.'

Judge Mark Eades told him: 'You knew from your position [as a police officer] you shouldn’t do it, you even made reference in your texts about being viewed as a paedophile, as a child molester - it’s true isn’t it?

'You saw her as ripe for the plucking. She was impressionable, going through puberty and all the anxieties that brings. You found her attractive and your lust overtook what you knew to be right.

'We have that graphic series of text messages that made it clear you were having sex at every opportunity you could. What’s even more disturbing is you were quite happy to have your son with you.'

Semak, from Kings Norton, Birmingham, is banned from working with or having unsupervised access to children under the conditions attached to the order. He was also ordered to sign the sex offenders' register for life

After a major police investigation was launched, the officer, who joined the force in 2010, was suspended, with his access to police buildings restricted.

A police spokesman said that as part of the lengthy inquiry in which texts and emails were scrutinised, detectives did not find any victims other than the girl who was known to Semak outside of work.

Detective Superintendent Tim Bacon, from the force’s Public Protection Unit, said: 'Christopher Semak has today been found guilty of sexual activity with a child.

'It is clear that he groomed the victim for his own sexual gratification. His actions were disgraceful for any person let alone a man who, when he became a police officer, swore an oath to protect people.

'Throughout his trial, Semak failed to take responsibility for his own actions.

'The verdict of the jury today reflects their belief that this was in fact a tissue of lies designed to undermine the victim and save himself.

'The sexual exploitation of children is child abuse. In this case, the offender is a police officer who whilst not on duty at the time betrayed the trust that the victim and others had in him to take advantage of the victim and in doing so has caused her severe emotional trauma.

'I hope that he will reflect on his actions and the emotional scars he inflicted on his victim and those around him.'

Police said Semak was handed a sexual offences prevention order in addition to the jail sentence.

Semak is banned from working with or having unsupervised access to children under the conditions attached to the order.

He was also ordered to sign the sex offenders’ register for life.

With criminal proceedings now completed, the case will go before a special police disciplinary panel where senior officers will determine his future with the force in line with national guidelines.
