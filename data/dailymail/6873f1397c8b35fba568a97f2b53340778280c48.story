Police found her so hysterical and aggressive officers had to restrain the mother of two with handcuffs. She was searched and was found to have her boyfriend’s s blood spattered bank card hidden in her bra.

Mr Dunne, 41, a father of three - who had been in a relationship with Heckles for three years and had a child with her - suffered fatal injuries in the attack and died at the scene.

In the run up to the killing, neighbours in an apartment block where the feuding couple lived in Bradford, West Yorkshire, said they heard so many rows through the paper thin walls, they became used to Heckles’ 'loud angry voice for hour after hour'.

A year before the tragedy police had already arrested Heckles on suspicion of assault amid claims she stabbed Mr Dunne in the neck with a smashed wine bottle.

Although Mr Dunne told medical staff he had been attacked bye his girlfriend, the case was dropped after he changed his story and said he had been injured when he was 'jumped' while walking home from a party late at night.

Assault: A year before the tragedy police had

 Mr Dunne in the neck with a smashed wine bottle - but this was later dropped

Five months later Mr Dunne himself was arrested outside the flat after Heckles complained he had punched her several times in her bedroom.

The case was also dropped after Heckles appeared to taunt Mr Dunne from the doorway of their flat as officer took him away. He later told police: 'She thinks she is the victim. She loses the plot sometimes.'

At Bradford Crown Court Heckles denied murder but was convicted after a week long trial. She refused to enter the dock to listen to the unanimous verdict being returned by the jury. The court heard she had 41 previous convictions, and served three jail terms for offences including, robbery, intimidating a witness, wounding and assault.

Ordering her to serve a minimum of 12 years in jail the judge Mr Justice Jeremy Stuart-Smith said the killing occurred after Mr Dunne had the knife and dropped it.

He added: 'She picked it up and the stabbing occurred moments later. The decision to pick up the knife must therefore be treated as spontaneous.

'I accept that she did not set out that evening with the intent of killing Mr Dunne or casing him serious bodily harm. But this was not a stab that was meant to just wound- it was meant to kill. It was an intention that was formed in the heat of the moment in the context of a prolonged domestic argument.

'I recognise her relationship with him was extremely complicated and volatile and that such relationships may sap a woman's will to get away.

'The physical violence was not just one way. I accept that Mr Dunne abused her physically on occasion.'

The killing occurred on January 18 during yet another late night bust up at the couple’s flat.

During the evening neighbours heard raised voices and recognised the sound of Heckles shouting and of furniture being tipped over and thrown around.

It went quiet for ten minutes and then Heckles was seen outside, screaming and with her hands covered in blood with one eye witness saying it was as if she 'wearing red gloves.'

Rows: Neighbours told the court that the pair constantly argued and they often heard screaming and shouting coming from their flat. The killing occurred on January 18 after yet another row at their flat

A 16-year-old neighbour, whose statement was read out in court, said he could hear lots of domestic arguments from the flat.

'There were constant arguments, with screaming and shouting,' he said. On the night of the stabbing, he was woken by a woman screaming: 'No, Scott, no.' He saw her outside her home with blood on her hands, crying and asking for help.

The teenager went into the flat to see if Mr Dunne was hurt. He saw him face down on the bedroom floor with a pool of blood seeping from under him.

The youth said there was a faint pulse on Mr Dunne’s neck. He shouted his name and rubbed his back to try to revive him, before running back to his flat to get help.

When the police arrived, Heckles struggled with officers and was handcuffed.

Holiday: Heckles told the jury the couple argued as she was due to fly out to Spain with her mother for a month’s holiday

Later at the police station she was 'aggressive and hysterical, her breath smelt of intoxicants and her eyes were glazed.' She banged her head on the floor and screamed: 'Tell me he’s not dead,' and was also heard repeatedly shouting: 'No, no, no, why would I hurt him. He’s the father of my baby' as officers try to calm her.

When she was taken to a cell immediately afterwards, Mr Dunne’s bloodstained bank debit card was found hidden in her bra.

It emerged Heckles stabbed Mr Dunne with a kitchen knife with a 19cm blade.

Andrew
 Kershaw prosecuting said: 'She held it firmly and she used severe force
 so that it cut completely through one rib, a part of his lung and 
through the left ventricle of his heart, causing a fatal wound almost as
 long as the blade of the the knife. She then removed the knife which 
would also have needed a severe amount of force.'

A pathologist said Mr Dunne died from blood loss after the knife blade pierced his heart with 'severe downward force.'

It
 was believed she took Mr Dunne’s wallet from his jeans pocket as he lay
 dying, removed his bank debit card while her fingers were wet with his 
blood, and hid it in her bra.

When
 interviewed by the police, Heckles said Mr Dunne had pushed her in the 
living room. He then came into the bedroom looking angry, with two 
knives. She said she had acted in self defence and the wounding was an 
accident saying: 'It was tragic, tragic accident in a tight space in a 
split second scenario. He came towards me. I protected myself.'

Heckles told the jury the couple argued as she was due to fly out to Spain with her mother for a month’s holiday.

She said she knew Mr Dunne would be upset and took pleasure in letting him know she was going away. She also told him the relationship was over and repeatedly asked him to leave and then went into the bedroom.

She claimed: 'The door flew open and Scott appeared. He had a small knife in his left hand and a large knife in his right hand. I said ‘What are you doing with those knives?’ He threw down the smaller knife. I was in front of the bedside table. He came towards me and I went towards him at the same time. He held the knife in front of him.

'I didn’t really have much time to think. I was scared and I wanted some control of the knife. I went to grab his right arm and he pushed me with his shoulder back on to the bed.'

She said he dropped the knife during a struggle and added: 'I picked it up because I was scared of what he was going to do with it,' she added. 'I wanted to remove it and leave the flat. I accept that I stabbed him. It was an accident. I never meant it to happen.'
