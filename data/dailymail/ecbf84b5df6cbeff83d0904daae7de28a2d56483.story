In years to come Per Mertesacker will tell his grandchildren about the three minutes he played for Germany in the World Cup final against Lionel Messi’s Argentina, not the 120 minutes he played for Arsenal in the FA Cup final against George Boyd’s Hull.

And so it is time for Arsene Wenger to seriously deliver at the Emirates.

Alexis Sanchez – all of sudden he’s gone from being the one who doesn’t quite fit in at Barcelona to the man who will make Arsenal world beaters.

World Cup Gunners: Arsenal stars Per Mertesacker, Lukas Podolski, and Mesut Ozil celebrate Germany's win

Never going to let you go: Podolski celebrates with the World Cup after Germany beat Argentina

It’s an amazing transformation.

It happened last summer, too. Mesut Ozil went from being the lazy one at Real Madrid to the ‘new Bergkamp’ at Arsenal.

The FA Cup gave the fans a great day out, but seeing Arsenal players win the World Cup is a reality check for Gooners who are letting Wenger get away with it.

After waiting all this time they should demand more. And in fairness to Gooners they do want more. In fact they are so desperate for more, they have hijacked Germany’s World Cup success as some sort of trophy for Arsenal.

Ozil had a decent game in the final but in the words of German legend Paul Breitner was ‘walking’ through the World Cup before that.

Mertesacker came on for the last few minutes of the final but Germany only started to look like serious contenders after he was dropped before the quarter final against France.

And Lukas Podolski is Arsenal’s version of John Terry. He put the kit on for the celebrations and wouldn’t let go of the World Cup.

Landing the big one: Ozil celebrates with the World Cup trophy

Blue is not the colour: Andre Schurrle celebrates with Mats Hummels - but no Chelsea fans are claiming credit for the win

The reality is that a Chelsea player, Andre Schurrle, was more influential for Germany than the three Gooners combined.

Yet I don’t hear Chelsea fans trying to claim they won the World Cup. Probably because they aren’t so desperate to claim any kind of football success as Arsenal supporters are.

So with Ozil a year into his Arsenal career, Aaron Ramsey fully fit and firing, Sanchez having arrived, as well as Mathieu Debuchy.

World class or misfit? Arsenal signed former Barcelona forward Alexis Sanchez

Set to join: Sami Khedira could be on his way to Arsenal, as could Newcastle defender Mathieu Debuchy

And talk of Sami Khedira (absolutely nothing stopping Wenger signing the Real Madrid man) on his way, what should Arsenal be aiming for?

Wenger has had 18 years at the club and his job is under no threat whatsoever. That kind of stability should give the Gunners an advantage. He is now being allowed to spend serious money.

So do Arsenal fans have the balls to set Wenger a target and judge him by it?

Would you be happy with the FA Cup and fourth place next year? I hope not.

Time to do more: Arsenal must win more than the FA Cup to be considered a sucess

Step up: Arsene Wenger celebrates winning the FA Cup but he must target the Premier League

Arsenal are bigger than that, and they now have players who are too big for that.

A real target, something to make the manager earn his money (it seems all he has to do is sign a player and Arsenal fans forgive him the barren years these days), is to win either the Premier League title, or the Champions League.

Gooners should settle for no less with the prices they pay, and the patience they’ve shown.

Having World Cup winners in the dressing room will lend true perspective on Wenger’s last 10 seasons without a title, and his whole career without any European success.

With his years of experience, no pressure of the sack, and money to spend, now is the time for Wenger to show us he has still got it.

Arsenal wrong to claim World Cup victory as theirs just because Per Mertesacker, Lukas Podolski, and Mesut Ozil were in Germany squad

FA Cup gave Arsenal fans a good day out at Wembley - but they must aim higher this season

Time for Arsene Wenger to deliver Premier League or European success
