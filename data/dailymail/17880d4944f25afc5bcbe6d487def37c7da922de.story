These no-expense spared designs showcase the future of private jet travel – complete with a bedroom, en-suite shower, and even a bubble wall.

The quirky installation takes centre stage in this concept for a Boeing 787-9, which also has a cinema room, created for a wealthy client.

It will be the world's first jet with the unique feature - the colour of which can be changed using a smartphone - and will be known as a VIP Dreamliner.

The 
company, VIP Completions Ltd, says the design is the ultimate in sky 
relaxation – and boasts flat seating, a private study, a make-up area 
and even a shower.

The
 stunning interior of the plane uses the contrasts of light and water 
and shimmering Swarovski Crystals to create a relaxing on board 
atmosphere.

White,
 black and silver and grey tones combine to create a thoroughly modern 
and spacious interior, which includes a forward galley where staff can 
serve from, meaning the passengers can relax uninterrupted.

The bubble wall is designed into the lounge and gives the visual effect of moving water with a mirror back finish.

Its owner, who is remaining anonymous, will be able to change colour schemes through an app in their smartphone.

A spokesman for VIP Completions said: 'The lounge layout is unique and an example of the design philosophy of flow.

'The
 room is split length-ways with a fore to aft curve to the seating which
 captures the owner’s feeling of the expression of flowing water, and 
provides an area which is removed of straight lines and immediately 
relaxing.'

The bubble wall is backlit with LED lighting which provides the mood-enhancing colour changes.

The rest of the private jet has a number of exciting mood features and open-plan seating in the lounge suits formal and informal talk, and post dinner relaxation.
