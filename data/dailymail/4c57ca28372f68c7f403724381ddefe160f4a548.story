Search crews have uncovered the body of one of two Utah women missing after a terrifying boat crash last week.

Sandy resident Valerie Rae Bradshaw, 29, was found lifeless just after 7 p.m. on Sunday about 340 feet underwater in Lake Powell, a popular recreational lake on the border of Utah and Arizona.

Kane County deputies have been searching for days for Bradshaw and her boyfriend's sister, Jessica Jackman, 22, who remains missing after the deadly collision last Thursday morning.

The women were on a family vacation at the lake and had been looking forward to the break for months. But the happy occasion turned to terror when the speedboat crashed into a houseboat near Dangling Rope Marina.

Miss Jackman's father, Adrian Jackman, of South Jordan, 
was driving the boat. The 59-year-old apparently tried to swerve when he noticed the moving houseboat ahead of him but hit 
the front corner, authorities said. The motorboat flipped, killing his 57-year-old wife, Marilyn Jackman, on impact and flinging the other passengers into the water.

Deputies were set to resume their search today in the hope of finding Miss Jackman in the same area.

Mr Jackman was apparently distracted by his young passengers when he hit the houseboat and flipped the craft.

The accident that happened at around 8 a.m. Miss Bradshaw was the girlfriend of Mr and Mrs Jackman's son.

Crews began searching the deep water 
on Friday using a robot equipped with a camera. But they ran into 
technical problems and had to call off the effort, according to Denise 
Shultz, spokeswoman for the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area that 
encompasses Lake Powell.

The Utah Highway Patrol was asked to bring in equipment from the Salt Lake City area, and the search resumed on Saturday and continued into Sunday.

Most of the people aboard the motorboat were family members from northern Utah, deputies said. Nobody on the houseboat was injured.

It's not uncommon for boaters to venture
out early in the morning while the waters of Lake Powell are smooth, 
said Kane County sheriff's Sgt. Alan Alldredge.

The vast man-made lake, bordered 
by sandstone walls and colorful rock formations, is a popular 
destination for houseboat vacations.

Deputies
said the group was headed to Rainbow Bridge — touted as the largest 
known natural bridge in the world — when the crash happened. Crews had 
to rescue some victims from the water, Shultz said.

All
of the six children aboard were wearing life jackets, officials said. Mr Jackman and his 11-year-old granddaughter were airlifted to a 
hospital in Flagstaff, Arizona, while a third person was taken to the 
hospital by ambulance.

Big dreams: Family friends say Jessica Jackman (far left) aspired to be Miss America and a social worker when she grew up

Keeping the faith: Jessica Jackman grew up in the Mormon Church, and her father serves as a local bishop for the Latter Day Saints church 

The Jackmans' family and friends in the town of South Jordan were left reeling from the news of the tragedy.

'It's been pretty hard to take,' neighbor Rick Wahlquist told the station KSL.
'And I know there's a lot of people that are really just struggling and
in shock over the whole thing. Marilyn is a saint and would do anything
for anybody at anytime.'

Adrian
Jackman serves as the bishop of the Later Day Saints Church's Parkway 
1st Ward in South Jordan. Friends say the whole family are avid boaters 
and vacationed on Lake Powell often.

Mr Wahlquist, who lived near the 
Jackmans for 20 years, said as a young girl, Jessica wanted to be a wife
and Miss America when she grew up. she also aspired to become a social 
worker.

Life of the party: Valerie Rae Bradshaw (right) was described by those who knew her as an outgoing and fun-loving young woman

Getaway gone awry: Valerie's roommates said the 29-year-old loved spending time on Lake Powell and had been looking forward to her vacation with the Jackmans for months

'Just a great young woman,' Wahlquist said. 'And what a tragedy to see this happen.'

Miss Bradshaw's friends said she was extremely outgoing and loved having fun. 

'She will be so missed because when 
she enters the room, it becomes full,' said roommate Aloyse Robertson. 
'It becomes bright. And we love her.'

Friend
Auri Root said Miss Bradshaw had been looking forward to the Lake Powell trip
for weeks and months. She leaves behind a twin sister.  

Vacation: Lake Powell, where the powerboat carrying 13 people flipped over, is a popular destination for boating holidays

The
crash happened in a channel a couple of hundred yards wide in Lake 
Powell. Police believe Mr Jackman may have looked away from where he was
headed after a child moved from the front to the back of the boat, KSL said.

Mr Alldredge said that as someone yelled 'Boat' the driver looked up to see a houseboat in their path.

As he tried to swerve, Mr Jackman clipped the houseboat with enough force to throw his 12 passengers overboard.

The water in Lake Powell is about 400ft deep at the crash site, according to Center Daily News.

'This time of year, the lake can get busy and these kinds of accidents, even though they're not rare, they do have a great potential for happening out there,' Mr Alldredge said.
