A pregnant 15-year-old girl who penned a heartfelt letter about her fears of becoming a young mother and how she dealt with the public's reaction has been stunned by the positive response she has received.

Georgie Hageman, from Auckland, New Zealand, said she often got disapproving looks as she walked down the street and felt she needed to write about her experiences as her due date approached.

The letter, which impressed her father so much he sent it to a local newspaper, prompted huge support from mums-to-be - both young and old - around the world.

'When I’m having a hard time, I write things down so I can put my feelings into perspective  – a bit like venting on paper,' Georgie, who is 36 weeks pregnant, told MailOnline, with her father's permission.

Georgia Hageman's letter about being a pregnant teenager has received support from all over the world

'No outsider will ever understand what a teen parent goes through until it happens to them. It's so easy to say that they've ruined their life.'

'I do miss my old life sometimes, but my role in this world has changed and that's okay.'

'It's no longer about me; it's about my gorgeous baby boy who I will be meeting in a few weeks.'

'There is a life that is relying on you, and no matter who stares, who judges, who talks, the fact that you're staying strong for that child is success.'

'Next time you go to judge somebody about their age and situation, I can tell you with 100 per cent confidence they know what they're missing out on and they know how their life will never be the same as yours and they do not need reminding.'

Excerpts from Georgia' open letter that was published in The New Zealand Herald

Georgia's honest and heartfelt words struck a chord with people on social media across the globe - particularly teenage mums and mums-to-be.

‘I have had girls from other countries like Australia and America thanking me for doing the article because they felt they could relate to it and they said I spoke up on behalf of them,' she said. 'I was incredibly shocked by the reaction but it was also really amazing.'

Georgia told other young pregnant girls in the letter, sent to The New Zealand Herald, not to ‘let the stares and whispers win, prove them wrong’.

'Most days it would be so much easier to give up, but the truth is there is another human being inside of you and you're their mummy,' she wrote.

She said although it can be humiliating to draw so much unwanted attention, all that mattered was her son, whom she has already named Mason ahead of his expected arrival on July 22.

‘I just walk around trying to hold my head high and think within myself that people can judge but I know the deeper meaning to the story,’ she told the MailOnline.

She said that teenage pregnancy was often associated with irresponsible behaviour but this was not the case in her situation.

'I have never drunk or smoked,' she said. 'I was just with the person I loved.'

Georgia said in the letter that she 'shared a bond and connection that I had never had with anyone else before'.

'We took a step into the unknown, and that was the day that my life changed forever,' she wrote.

'I do miss my old life sometimes, but my role in this world has changed and that's okay,' she wrote. 'It's no longer about me; it's about my gorgeous baby boy who I will be meeting in a few weeks.'

Although, Georgia admitted to feeling terrified about breaking the news to her parents in November, she said their support had been unwavering.

Georgia admitted that it took her a few months to completely come to terms with her pregnancy but now she 'wouldn't change it for the world'.

'A lot of times I wish I could be a normal teenager – still attending school - but for me there’s a lot to look forward to,' she said. 'It's not all about having a normal teenagehood, it’s about having a different one.'
