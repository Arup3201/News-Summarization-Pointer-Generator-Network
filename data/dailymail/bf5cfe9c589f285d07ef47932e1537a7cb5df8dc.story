It is a brave statement written from the heart, by a young woman fighting for her life.

'I am happy, I am alive and I was built to survive'.

The words are part of a heartbreaking video created by young mother Abi  Rounds, who was diagnosed with breast cancer at just 22.

After just two days to digest the news with her closest family members - including her mother, father and boyfriend - she decided to reveal her diagnosis to other loved ones via an emotional video on her Facebook page.   

The clip has now been watched almost 9,000 times all over the world and Miss Rounds said the messages of support have helped her face a double mastectomy and chemotherapy.

Abi Rounds, who was diagnosed with breast cancer at just 22, shared her terrible news with loved ones via a video she uploaded to Facebook

In the video, the mother-of-one (pictured here with daughter Ruby May) who has watched her own mother and aunt fight the disease, vowed to do everything it takes to beat the disease

The video comprises a series of clips such as the above, explaining to her loved ones what has happened 

Her brave words have been watched by thousands of people after the video went viral

The now 23-year-old, who has watched her own mother and aunt fight the disease, said: 'When they told me I had cancer It was terrifying.  I I felt sick and the worst went through my head.

'As soon as I came home from hospital, I got my two-year-old daughter from my sister who was looking after her, and got my cousin and sister to come to my house and I told them the news.

'But from there on I thought that's it, I'm going to do this - nothing is going to stop me now.

'From that moment I've got on well, I'm really positive and the support has been overwhelming.

'People around me knew there was something wrong and it was getting to the point where I was having to repeat myself - it was too much.

'I thought maybe if I do a video I can get my message across,' said Miss Rounds, from Leominster, Herefordshire,

'It was probably one of the hardest things I have ever done, but looking back it is one of the best things too.

'The support has been absolutely amazing and has really got me through the tough times.

'It has been incredible getting messages from strangers telling me to keep strong.

Miss Rounds was just 11 when her mother Julie, 46, was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a single mastectomy.

Two years ago her aunt had the same treatment for a tumour.

Her own cancer was diagnosed last December. 

Miss Rounds has now shaved off her blonde hair and is undergoing chemotherapy following surgery

Miss Rounds - along with various family members - has also raised more than £2,000 for Breast Cancer UK by shaving their heads

Miss Rounds had been watching TV when she felt an itch on her right breast and found two lumps. 

After a GP appointment she was referred to Hereford County Hospital where doctors went against convention to perform a biopsy because of her family history.

Just a week later medics asked her to come back - with family members for support - and delivered the news she had two cancerous lumps, grade two and three.

'It was a shock to be told - I didn't expect it at all,' said Miss Rounds.

'I thought it was nothing to worry about because I was so young, fit and healthy, so I didn't think it could be cancer.

'They don't normally do a biopsy until you are 25, but because of my family history I had one.

'They rang me and told me to make an appointment and they said did I have someone to come with me, and I had a feeling.' 

In the video - which has been viewed nearly 9,000 times, said: 'The reason I am posting this is because I have had so many lovely kind messages off so many people. 

Miss Rounds (with her daughter) was just 11 when her mother Julie, 46, was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a single mastectomy

In the video, she says: 'I never thought I would be sitting in the same position as my mum, at the age of 22, getting told I have breast cancer. It is scary, and it is a shock, and you just don't think it will ever happen to you'

'I just thought instead of me repeating myself to everyone, this would be the  easiest way for me to say it, and you will all find out sooner or later.

'I never thought I would be sitting in the same position as my mum, at the age of 22, getting told I have breast cancer.

'It is scary, and it is a shock, and you just don't think it will ever happen to you.

'But with the support of my amazing family, fantastic friends, and my daughter, I will do that and I will kick cancer's butt!'

After a family Christmas with partner Jamie, 23, and daughter Ruby May, two, she had a double mastectomy in a four hour operation on January 13.

However further tests have revealed the cancer has spread to her lymph nodes, so she is now undergoing chemotherapy. 

'I'm doing really well and I just want people to know that you can have cancer at this young age, and always just go and get checked'.

Miss Rounds - along with various family members - has also raised more than £2,000 for Breast Cancer UK by shaving their heads.
