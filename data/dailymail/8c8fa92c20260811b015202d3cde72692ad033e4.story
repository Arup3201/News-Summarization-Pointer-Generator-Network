Stephanie Gilmore has a lot to be grateful for this Thanksgiving Day.

The Aussie pro surfer says winning the 2014 women's world surfing title in Hawaii on Thursday came at a very 'appropriate time'.

Needless to say the 26-year-old is on cloud nine having won her sixth ASP World Champion title, the Target Maui Pro, the event Gilmore won her first world crown at in 2007 as a rookie.

The six-time world champion, of Murwillumbah in far north-eastern NSW, spoke to Daily Mail Australia just a couple of hours after the competition as she struggled to come to terms with her big win.

The Aussie pro surfer won her first world title at the same even back in 2007 when she was a 19-year-old rookie

Gilmore entered the event as the defending champion, having claimed consecutive victories at this world-class break in 2007, 2008 and 2009, the last time a world tour event was held at Honolua Bay

'It's pretty hard to sum up how I feel at the moment and everything feels so surreal,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'I feel incredibly happy and emotionally drained as it's been quite a wild day.

'But I think it's all happened at a very appropriate time seeing it's Thanksgiving Day here.'

Gilmore won her sixth world title after making the quarterfinals as teammate Sally Fitzgibbons, ranked number 2 in the world, was eliminated from the contest by South Africa's Bianca Buitendag in their quarterfinals heat.

World number 3 and Aussie Tyler Wright was eliminated by Hawaii's Carissa Moore in the contest final.

Winning this particular competition has been momentous for Gilmore, who won her first world title at the same event during her rookie year at the age of 19.

'I won my first world title here and am speechless that today I've won my sixth world title at Honolua Bay, a break I dreamed about surfing as a kid,' she said. 

'This is a very special place for me as I fell in love with this place back then and now I've fallen in love with it even more.'

The world champion, from Murwillumbah in far north-eastern NSW, first began surfing at the age of 10

Looking back, Gilmore can't fathom how far she's come.

She says she's grateful that her dad, who's also an avid surfer, took her out years ago to catch her first wave.

'I began surfing at the age of 10 with dad and loved it so much that I started competing when I was 12,' she said.

'I really didn't expect to come this far.'

But despite her celebrating win, Gilmore's thoughts were with the grieving family and friends of Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes who died yesterday after being struck by a ball on Tuesday afternoon.

'I didn't know him but I was just as shocked and heartbroken when I heard the news,' Gilmore said.

'It was clear that he was seen as a true champ to not only the cricketing world but also to the Australian sports people.

'I know it's been a tough few days back in Australia so this really puts things into perspective for me.' 

Gilmore says winning her sixth world title feels 'surreal' and 'emotionally draining'

Gilmore's world champion titles include 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012 and 2014

In December 2010, the young champion's whole life came to stand still after a random attack left her in emotional turmoil with head and wrist injuries to boot.

She had been making her way back to her apartment in Coolangatta, New South Wales, when she noticed a random man from a car park she'd walked through, run at her with a metal bar in one hand.

The then 22-year-old was left with head and wrist injuries and told she couldn't surf for the six weeks leading up to her next competition.

This year Gilmore spoke out about how she overcame her trauma to rise back to the top of the surfing league in the feature film, Stephanie In The Water.

Gilmore's world champion titles include 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012 and 2014.
