A Japanese company is offering a range of bizarre mouthpieces and contraptions to help reduce the signs of ageing.

The website, Japan Trend Shop sells the items, which are said to tighten the cheeks while doing breathing exercise and therefore hiding wrinkles.

Users are advised to insert the mouthpiece and make mouth movements with it for three minutes a day.

To get the best results the instructions say 'to make vowel sounds out loud over and over again'.

Also available is a device, which is billed as being able to ‘straighten your nose’ and a mask which claims will get rid of smile lines by acting as a bra.
