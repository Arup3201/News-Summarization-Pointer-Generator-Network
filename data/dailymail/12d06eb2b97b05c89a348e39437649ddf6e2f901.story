It was deja vu all over again for President Obama and his outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder.

Eyes glistening with tears, Obama bid an affectionate farewell to Holder Friday for a second time, but this tribute came with a soulful surprise.

'Eric is really just milking this departure thing for everything that it's worth,' Obama quipped at a Justice Department ceremony to unveil the outgoing Cabinet member's official portrait. 'I mean, golly.'

But even Obama got upstaged this time.

Surprise! Holder claps in surprise as Obama applauds at the announcement that singer Aretha Franklin would entertain at the unveiling of Holder's official portrait at the Department of Justice

VIP guest: Aretha Franklin, the 'Queen of Soul,' made an unannounced appearance at the ceremony  

After the president and the attorney general had concluded their remarks, Aretha Franklin, the 'Queen of Soul,' made an unannounced appearance in the Justice Department hall. 

Holder, stunned, genuflected to the 72-year-old 'Natural Woman' songstress dressed in a festive shimmering outfit. And Franklin stepped behind the lectern to sing America the Beautiful with an homage to Holder, who was visibly moved by the gesture. 

The Daily Caller repoorted that as Franklin approached the podium to sing, Obama rushed to her side and handed her a stepping stool with the words, 'Hold on, Queen.'

According to multiple published reports, Franklin later gave the president a first bump.

In his own remarks, Obama noted Holder's six-year tenure as the third-longest serving attorney general. Holder also is the first African-American man to hold the job.

'I know it felt even longer and I'll just come out and say it. He's been one of our finest,' Obama said.

Moved: The famously stoic commander-in-chief became emotional as he listened to the Queen of Soul 

Obama said Holder had led the department with integrity and helped make the US 'free and more just.' 

He praised Holder as a 'great friend' and a 'great public servant' and brushed away tears at the conclusion of his brief speech.

Holder, 64, is staying on the job until the Senate confirms his successor, which is expected soon. 

The Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday approved Obama's choice of U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch to succeed Holder. She would be the first black woman to be the nation's top law enforcement officer.

In a veiled reference to Rudolph Giuliani's assertion that Obama did not love his country, Holder declared 'those who have loved this nation most have dared greatly and have sought to change the status quo for the better.' 

Picture perfect: Besides Franklin's performance, the other highlight of the ceremony was the unveiling of Holder's official portrait. The artist Simmie Knox (far left) and Holder's wife, Sharon Malone, were on hand for the occasion

He offered a litany of examples, from Abraham Lincoln and Jackie Robinson to Martin Luther King Jr. and Harvey Milk. Then he paused and added pointedly, 'Barack Obama.'

Holder offered special thanks to Sen. Patrick Leahy, the former Democratic Senate Judiciary Committee chairman. Leahy, of Vermont, defended Holder during Holder's clashes with Republican lawmakers who held him in contempt in the House over a document dispute arising from a gun-trafficking operation known as Fast and Furious.

'In tough times, both professional and personal, this is a man who has been there for me,' Holder said at the top of his remarks.
