The iconic 'I Love New York' logo has been ditched as part of a $5 million tourist campaign... and replaced with a pizza slice and beach ball, among other designs.

Governor Andrew Cuomo unveiled the overhaul today, ditching the image that has sold countless mugs, t-shirts and baseball caps and is a world-renowned symbol of the indomitable spirit of the city.

New Yorkers and visitors have been asked to sketch their own takes on the famous logo to show what they love about New York State.

Say cheese: A $5million overhaul of New York tourism has replaced the iconic 'I Love New York' logo with visitors interpretations... including the pizza slice

Tourist trade: The iconic I Heart New York logo has sold countless t-shirts, hats, sweaters, mugs, key chains...

Governor Cuomo said: 'Tourism is vital to the economy of our state, supporting nearly 500,000 jobs and generating tens of billions of dollars.

'This campaign reinvents one of our state's greatest assets... which is known the world over as one of the most successful advertising symbols ever.'

He added: 'There is no state that has anything over on the state of New York.'

The new adverts will be shown on network and local TV and on screens in the back of New York City yellow cabs.

They mainly promote sites outside the city including Niagara Falls, Finger Lakes, Saratoga Races and the Adironracks.

The new idea came from the New York Tourism Department and BBDO Advertising, which inspired the fictional Sterling Cooper agency in the hit series Mad Men. They have previously made adverts for M&Ms, Volkswagen, FedEx and Lowe's.

New York is working harder to attract tourists as other U.S. destinations adopted aggressive advertising campaigns to reel in visitors. 

Among states, New York ranks third in size of tourist economies behind Florida and California. This year, more that 51 million visitors were expected to New York State, from both home and abroad, pulling in $34 billion in revenue.  

The logo was created by Milton Glaser in the mid-Seventies and is set in an American Typewriter font. The designer's original sketches sit in the permanent collection at the Museum of Modern Art in midtown Manhattan. 

The image became a symbol of unity for New Yorkers following 9/11. Glaser redid the sign so it read 'I Love NY More Than Ever' with a black spot on the heart to symbolize the World Trade Center site.
