A fugitive child molester has been arrested after 28 years on the run, posing as a dead man from Rhode Island.

Stanley Shane Self, who went on the run in 1986, was busted trying to used a false identity to claim Social Security benefits.

Self was convicted by a court in Arizona of three counts of child molestation - but went on the run and had been missing ever since. 

Cornered: Stanley Shane Self, 74, was arrested in Alabama 28 years after being convicted by an Alabama jury of three counts of child molestation

He had been living in Hollywood, Alabama for years, using the identity of a man from Rhode Island who died in 1987, according to federal investigators.

According to local news station WFSB, people in the town where he'd been laying low knew him as Terry Martell.

According to neighbors, Self had always seemed 'nice' - and would even to go church with them. 

Officials said Self presented a Rhode Island birth certificate and an Oklahoma driver's license with the false name when he applied for benefits.

When his credentials didn't check out, a Social Security worker flagged the case as suspicious - and an investigating led to the pedophile being unveiled. 

A federal magistrate judge in Alabama had dismissed the false statement charges against Self so he can be returned to Arizona.

Self's attorney, James Gibson, declined to comment. He is currently being held in Morgan County Jail, Alabama - but Arizona authorities are set to extradite him soon.

U.S. Attorney Joyce White Vance said: 'This man skirted justice for many years, but he did not escape it,.

'Thanks to an alert Social Security employee in Albertville and swift investigation by Social Security OIG and Secret Service agents, Self will soon face the punishment for his crimes committed more than 30 years ago in Arizona.'
