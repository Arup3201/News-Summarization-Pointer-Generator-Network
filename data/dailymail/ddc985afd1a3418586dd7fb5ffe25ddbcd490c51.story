With the stricken victim safely plucked from a 30ft roof after a two-hour operation, firefighters may have insisted it was a successful operation.

But taxpayers were left questioning the wisdom of a £1,000 mission to rescue a seagull with a fire engine and aerial ladder platform – especially as the bird had to be put down almost straight away.

The gull was spotted on Sunday morning by a family on the roof of their three-storey home in Esher, Surrey. They could see it was injured but could not reach it, so called the RSPCA.

They in turn called the fire brigade, 
which sent a fire engine, but the crew was unable to reach the gull so a
 second team was called in with the high-rise equipment from Chertsey, 
nine miles away.

Hoisting 
the longer ladder then proved tricky because of electrical wires around 
the house.

Neighbour Sarah Pitchforth, 36, said: ‘There was such a 
commotion, we thought someone had fallen from a  window or had an 
accident. I couldn’t believe it when my son came back and said it was a bird.’

The gull was handed to the RSPCA but had to be put to sleep because it was suffering from leg injuries and suspected botulism.

A
 spokesman for the charity said: ‘While this has a sad  ending, we would
 like to thank the fire and rescue service for their assistance. It is a
 great training aid for the service and their help meant the RSPCA was 
able to quickly and painlessly help a suffering animal.’

But
 TaxPayers’ Alliance director John O’Connell said: ‘Nobody wants to see 
animals suffer, but incidents like these raise serious concerns about 
whether this is the best way for the fire brigade to use its time. It 
does seem like a rather excessive response.’

On
 a local newspaper website, one user wrote: ‘What a waste of money. It’s
 just an airborne rat. What was needed was somebody with an air rifle.’

When the first fire crew couldn't reach the bird, firefighters from Chertsey fire station, above, were called on

A
 recent Freedom of Information request sent to 56 fire services showed 
they had rescued 17,000 animals in the three years to 2011 at a cost of 
£3.5million. That included 2,090 birds, among them 1,244 seagulls, 159 
pigeons, 57 swans and 12 parrots.

They
 have also been called out to rescue dolphins, bats, iguanas, a 
chameleon – and even a snail that was crawling up an elderly woman’s 
wall.

In 2012, 25 firemen 
were sent to rescue a seagull from a 3ft-deep pond in South London – but
 then refused to wade in because of health and safety regulations.

The
 RSPCA spokesman added: ‘Like any member of the public, the RSPCA can 
request the help of the Fire and Rescue Service, but it is entirely up 
to them what level of response they can provide.’

Last
 night a Surrey Fire and Rescue spokesman said: ‘The main reason we 
carry out animal rescues is that if we don’t do it there is a strong 
possibility that members of the public will attempt a rescue, putting 
themselves at risk without our skills and experience.’

He
 added: ‘We used available resources, with equipment and crews at three 
nearby stations ready to cover any other incidents, and if human life 
were at risk we would have redirected those involved in the rescue at 
once.’

The spokesman confirmed that one fire engine attended, plus an aerial ladder platform which was on site for less than an hour.
