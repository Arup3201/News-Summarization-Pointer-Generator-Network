More than 12,000 patients are going to A&E at least ten times a year, figures show.

They include more than 150 who turn up every week and a handful who arrive five times a week.

Such patients are referred to by  medical staff as ‘frequent flyers’ and they include the homeless, alcoholics, drug abusers and those with mental health problems.

Repeat visits: Emergency staff are being put under increasing pressure by patients bypassing their local doctor surgeries and heading straight to A&E

Others who go once or twice a month 
tend to be the elderly with illnesses which aren’t properly managed and 
migrants who don’t know how to make an appointment with a GP. Senior 
doctors warn that already-strained A&E units cannot cope with the 
added pressure from these patients and say they need to be cared for 
elsewhere by GPs and community health services.

Separate
 NHS figures show the number of seriously-ill patients arriving in 
casualty reached a three year high at the end of last month.

A
 total of 75,751 patients – mainly elderly – had to be admitted to a 
ward from A&E in the week ending December 22, the highest since the 
last week of 2011.

The 
deputy head of the NHS, Barbara Hakin, admitted the figures were a 
‘significant concern’. There are fears elderly patients are not being 
properly looked after by carers, community nurses and GPs.Dame Barbara 
also warned that the next few weeks would be the ‘toughest of the year’ 
for A&E with more vulnerable patients succumbing to pneumonia and 
other infections in the colder temperatures.

Dame
 Barbara, who is deputy chief executive for NHS England, also warned 
that the number of emergency admissions – patients needing to be 
admitted on to a ward from A&E – had risen by nearly a third in a 
decade.

Katherine Murphy, of the Patients' Association, and Dr Cliff Mann, of the College of Emergency Medicine, said people making repeated visits to A&E put pressure on already overstretched emergency staff

An investigation by 
the BBC using the Freedom of Information Act show that 157 patients went
 to casualty at least 50 times last year.One visited Luton and Dunstable
 A&E 234 times, another turned up at Lewisham in south London, 225 
times and one went to Northern General Hospital in Sheffield on 223 
occasions.

Dr Clifford Mann,
 president of the College of Emergency Medicine, which represents 
A&E doctors, said: ‘Some individuals attended 250 times a year which
 is almost five times a week, whereas others are using it ten times a 
year which is more like once a month.

‘There’s clearly a difference between those groups but most of them are to some extent on the margins of society.

‘There
 are a lot of problems  associated with drugs and alcohol, some with 
homelessness, a lot with mental health problems, isolation and 
loneliness for some individuals.’

He
 said on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘It’s also fair to say that some
 people are unfamiliar with the system of healthcare in this country and
 in particular the way in which they access general practice. For these 
people, at least when they first arrive, attending A&E department 
seems like the most straightforward way to access healthcare.’

n
 Residents of three cities were urged to avoid going to A&E unless 
they faced a real emergency after three major hospitals went on ‘black 
alert’.

Peterborough City 
Hospital, Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge and Milton Keynes Hospital
 in Buckinghamshire have all seen an unexpectedly high influx of 
patients. Black alert is the highest crisis level for a hospital, 
meaning there is severe pressure on staff and the number of beds 
available.

More than half of the beds at Peterborough City Hospital have been taken up by patients over 80 with winter chest infections.

The figures below show how many attendances each A&E unit had over 12 months from people who visited at least 10 times in the year.
