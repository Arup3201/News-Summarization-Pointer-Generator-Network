The death-defying drop, at Tahquamenon Falls State Park in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, was also captured by Megan Rappa, an extreme sports photographer from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

The waterfall, which has a drop of 50ft and is more than 200ft wide, is the second largest fall east of the Mississippi River and is Marcelo's biggest ever freefall descent.

Marcelo, who took up the sport in 2007, has kayaked over 100 waterfalls around the world in places such as the River Futa in Chile and the Escondido River in Nicaragua.

Photographer Megan said: 'Before the shoot Marcelo was a complete stranger to me. Remarkably, we met on Tinder and he invited me along to take some pictures of the drop.'

Megan added: 'As a young adventure-loving photographer there was something inside that couldn't pass this opportunity up.

'Marcelo scoped the falls out for about an hour or two and picked the best line to take, he was very meticulous.

'The first time Marcelo dropped I was a little nervous for him, just like everyone else watching, but I knew he was an experienced professional.

'That's the awesome thing about taking risks and doing what you love though, absolutely nothing else matters. Not even time.'
