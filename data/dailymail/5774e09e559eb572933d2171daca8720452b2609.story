An amateur player in Switzerland has been slapped with a 50-year ban after he kicked the ball into the face of the referee, before spraying him with water.

The remarkable incident occurred during Portugal Futebol Clube's 1-0 fourth division defeat to SC Worb in the local Bern league.

According to Swiss newspaper Blick, defender Ricardo Ferreira of Portugal Futebol Clube, who was an unused substitute, stormed the pitch at full-time and booted the ball at the referee from close-range.

Ferreira was also reported to have hurled abuse at the official and squirted him with water as he made his way down the tunnel.

Robert Breiter, the lawyer of Switzerland’s amateur football league, said: 'We do not want such a player in our league. Unfortunately we encounter such cases about once a year.'

The defender, who was previously banned for 45 matches for assaulting opposition players and abusing officials, did not expect to escape punishment following the incident but was shocked at the length of the ban.

'I had expected one or two years maximum. But 50 years? Football’s my life.' Ferreira said.

The ban served is officially life-long but the governing body's computer required an end-date, which was set 50 years later.

Ferreira would be eligible to play again on June 5, 2064 at the age of 78.
