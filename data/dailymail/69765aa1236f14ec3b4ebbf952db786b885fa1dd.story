Travelers will now be allowed to bring golf clubs, ski poles and even small knives on planes with them since aviation officials have announced significant security changes.

A number of previously-banned items will be allowed for the first time since the September 11 terrorism attacks, sparking outrage from flight attendants who said the decision would endanger passengers and crew.

The TSA said effective April 25, it would allow small knives with blades that are 2.36 inches or less in length and less than 1/2 inch wide.

Other items that will be allowed on board again as part of a passenger's carry-on luggage include billiard cues, ski poles, hockey sticks and lacrosse sticks.

Items that had been prohibited like razors, box cutters or knives with a fixed blade are still not allowed on board.

The restrictions about liquids are still in place as well, meaning that anything under 3-ounces must be declared at the security checkpoint.

TSA spokesman David Castelveter said the decision was made to bring U.S. regulations more in line with International Civil Aviation Organization standards and would also help provide a better experience for travelers.

Exemptions: Only certain bats are allowed but many think it is premature to allow any at all

The Association of Professional Flight attendants 'categorically rejects a proposal to allow knives of any kind in the cabin,' and they don't understand why 'such a momentous decision' was made without any consultation.

As for some of the larger items that they will now allow, like the sports equipment, increases 'the potential for passengers getting hit with these items during boarding and deplaning. It's a recipe for disaster,' said the APFA representative.

'This is part of an overall Risk-Based
 Security approach, which allows Transportation Security officers to 
better focus their efforts on finding higher-threat items such as 
explosives,' he said.

The 
Flight Attendants Union Coalition, which represents nearly 90,000 flight
 attendants from carriers across the country, called the decision a 
'poor and shortsighted decision' by the TSA.

'As the last line of defense in the cabin and key aviation partners, we believe that these proposed changes will further endanger the lives of all flight attendants and the passengers we work so hard to keep safe and secure,' the coalition said in a statement.

Castelveter said the TSA has implemented a number of safety measures including reinforced cockpit doors, allowing some pilots to be armed and federal air marshals on board airplanes. He said those measures would help ensure safety of the passengers and crew.

After the September 11, 2001 hijacking attacks, the U.S. government imposed a strict set of guidelines for what could be carried on board an aircraft - some of which differed from what other countries allowed passengers to carry on airplanes.
