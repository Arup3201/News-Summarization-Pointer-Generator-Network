An Australian farmer has found a new and unique way to share what goes on at her mixed irrigation farm. 

Since September, Aimee Snowden has photographed LEGO figurines on their daily adventures at her parent's lucerne hay production farm in Southern Riverina, New South Wales for her Lego Farmer blog.

The 24-year-old told Daily Mail Australia that she was inspired by the well-known travel blog, The LEGO Travellers, but that she noticed a gap in LEGO photography topics.

The 24-year-old hopes to connect with people who are not familiar with what goes on in a farm through the project

'Instagram has a strong LEGO community, but there was nothing on the topic of famers,' Ms Snowden said.

'I've grown up on a farm and always had an interest in Australian agriculture, so when I saw The LEGO Travellers I saw a different way to connect with people who are not familiar with what goes on in a farm. 

'LEGO is also a great toy that transcends generations and allows you to be creative.'

Fascinated with macro photography, Ms Snowden's photos show a couple of farmers going about their daily business - stacking bales, feeding calves and harvesting various grains.

'I have been most over whelmed with the response… there are a few thousand people looking at the blog today,' Ms Snowden said

With her photographs spread across a blog, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, the photo project has attracted growing interest online. 

'I have been most overwhelmed with the response… there are a few thousand people looking at the blog today,' Ms Snowden said.

The avid farmer said she was looking forward to sharing more happenings of her Lego mini-figures over Christmas, and has already begun a '12 days of Christmas' photo series as the holiday creeps nearer.
