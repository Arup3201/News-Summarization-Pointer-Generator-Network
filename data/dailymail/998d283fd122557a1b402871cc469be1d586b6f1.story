A six-year-old boy has had 325 shotgun pellets removed from his face after accidentally being shot by his cousin in China.

Yang Yang was playing with his cousin in Neijiang, in southwest China's Sichuan Province, when the pair came across the gun.

Thinking it was a toy, Yang's cousin, also six, reportedly picked it up and shot him in the face.

An x-ray of Yang Yang's face shows the shotgun pellets lodged in his left cheek; the boy was accidentally shot by his cousin in China after the boys came across the gun

Doctors removed all 325 pellets from Yang's face; each pellet measured 2mm in diameter

Yang was said to have had a 'huge hole' in his face after the shooting and was bleeding profusely 

The boys came back inside their house about ten minutes later, according to their grandmother, who has not been named.

She said: 'They were crying, and Yang Yang's face had a huge hole, bleeding profusely?'

Yang's father, who has also not been named, said both boys were terrified and couldn't believe what had happened. 

Doctors later removed the pellets, each 2mm in diameter, from Yang's face.

It was not know what condition Yang was in following the surgery, but he is thought to have survived.
