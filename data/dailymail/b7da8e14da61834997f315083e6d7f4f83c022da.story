A male hairdresser has been reunited with his long lost father after he recognised him on TV talking about  his embarrassing man boobs.

Haydn Wells, 20, volunteered for Channel 4’s Embarrassing Bodies programme after he developed large breasts when he lost seven stone in weight.

Incredibly, his biological father Adrian Van Sertima was watching the show and recognised the family resemblance immediately.

Mr Van Sertima,
50, split up from Mr Wells's mother when she was pregnant with him and 
has spent the last two decades trying to track him down.

After contacting his son on Facebook the pair confirmed they were father and son.

Mr
Wells, a hairdresser from Newark, Nottinghamshire, said: 'I never 
thought that my embarrassing man boobs would bring me to my father I had
never met - it’s just been incredible.'

Mr Van Sertima
was watching ‘Embarrassing Bodies’ on July 3 at his home in Colchester,
Essex, which featured Mr Wells who was about to undergo plastic surgery
to remove his man boobs, known as ‘moobs’.

He suffered from gynaecomastia - 
abnormal development of large mammary glands in males resulting in 
breast enlargement - which he developed after shedding seven stone in 
weight last year.

He had an operation to remove the excess tissue earlier this year and the surgery was filmed for the TV show.

Mr Van Sertima recognised the man on screen as having an uncanny resemblance to his other son.

his father spotted him and realised that he looked very much like his 
other son

After the show Mr Van Sertima looked up Haydn on Facebook and sent him a message saying: 'I think I might know your mother.'

Haydn replied: 'I think you might be my biological dad.'

The
delighted pair started chatting over the social networking site to 
catch up on the past two decades - and are now planning to meet next 
week.

Mr Wells said: 'I have a whole new part of my life - everything’s changed since I had the operation.

'My dad said that I look a lot like his other son, so he put two and two together. I had always been an only child and now I’ve got a half-brother.

'All he knew was my name and that I lived in Nottinghamshire. He said that I look a lot like his other son, so he put two and two together.

'It’s really strange to go from being an only child and never knowing my dad, to having all of these aunts, uncles, cousins and grandparents that I never had before.

'He said that all his family have been going crazy and they’re really excited because they’ve got a whole new family member.'

Mr Van Sertima met his son's mother while he was in the RAF in Essex in 1990 and they had a brief relationship.

They stayed together for a few months before breaking up shortly after she fell pregnant with their son.

Mr Wells was born in 1992 but Mr Van Sertima never met his son.

Mr Van Sertima said: 'When me and his mother split up, she rang me saying she was pregnant but I didn’t believe her.

'She said that she’d get on with her own life and I carried on with mine.

'One day I rang her and asked if he’d been born, she said he had and he was called Haydn. I never got the chance to see him.

'Then, while watching TV, when I saw the way one of the people on the show walked and smiled on screen, I saw how much he was like my son Nicholas.

'I thought ‘crikey’, he looks like my son. More and more when I saw the way he walked and smiled, I saw how much he was like my other son.

'Every time I had tried to find him before it was just a dead end.

'But after I saw the spelling of his name on the show I found him on Facebook and sent him a message.

'I said, ‘I think I might know your mum, but I’m not sure. Ask her if she knew someone in the air force called Vanse?’ - as that was my nickname when I was in the RAF.

'He replied that she did and that I must be his dad. It’s a miracle that I have found him now.'

Father and son are planning to meet for the first time next week.
