The mother of a woman who allegedly had a child with her father claims she tried to tell authorities about the incestuous relationship more than five years ago but was ignored.

Vikki McConvey, from Bethel, Connecticut, said she went to police in January 2007 after she suspected there was more to her daughter Tiffany Hartford's relationship with George L. Sayers, 46, than just father and daughter.

But she said police told her that because Tiffany was over 18 at the time, nothing could be done about it.

The pair were charged on Monday with 
third-degree sexual assault after DNA tests proved they are father and daughter and parents to their child.

of other relatives

Ms McConvey said she moved back to Connecticut in 2006 so Tiffany could be near to her father who she hadn't seen since she was three years old. She broke up with Sayers in 1991.

She wanted to list her as a runaway after Sayers took his daughter to Florida but again police said because she was 18 there was nothing they could do.

'I said to them, "Even if she was having 
relations with her father?"' It was something McConvey suspected 
'because they insisted on sharing the same bed.'

She also revealed to The News Times that Tiffany was abused for years by another person who was later prosecuted for the crime.

'That is why she turned out the way she is,' Ms McConvey said of the 23-year-old.

Although she hadn't seen her daughter for several months before her arrest, McConvey said she instinctively knew something was wrong.

'It was just the way that they were always together. Like they both put on their Facebook pages that they were married but didn't mention who their spouses were,' she said.

Reported: Hartford's ex-girlfriend went to police when she learned Sayers was selling videos of the former couple having sex when they were just 16

Incest: Both Sayers and Hartford initially denied knowing they were father and daughter, but DNA tests confirmed this and that they had a son together

'I didn't know what to think. I'd hope that it was just a father-and-daughter thing and nothing else.

'I tried to talk to Tiffany into coming home with me. She wouldn't. She wanted to get to know her father more, she told me.'

The
couple were shopped to police this week by Tiffany's ex-girlfriend who 
was angry that Sayers was selling pictures of sex videos of her.

A search of Sayers' computer turned up similar images, as well as a commercial video of Hartford dressed in risque outfits and 
posing in sexually provocative positions, crediting 
him with being the producer, police said.

Because she was over 16 when they were taken, they are not considered to be child porn.

The father and daughter were also charged with obscenity and conspiracy. They have pleaded not guilty to all charges.

Hartford,
who would introduce Sayers as her 'husband/father', told police she had
dreams of being a porn star - this was before she became pregnant with 
her father's child.

In separate interviews, both Sayers and Hartford initially denied knowing they were father and daughter, according to the NewsTimes, although Sayers said at one point he believed that Hartford was the daughter of his deceased brother, police said.
