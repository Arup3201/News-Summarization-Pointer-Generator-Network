Dramatic images capture the moment that an 80-year-old woman was freed from the rubble of her home after it was reportedly destroyed in an air strike on Syria's largest city.

The woman is believed to have been trapped for several hours before she was rescued by volunteers combing the streets of Aleppo following the reported raid by government forces. 

Photographs show her curled up in a small alcove beneath a section of the collapsed building - her arm shielding her head from falling rock - before she is carried to safety on a stretcher.

The extent of her injuries is not known.

Trapped: The 80-year-old woman was rescued from the rubble where her home once stood in Aleppo, Syria

Destroyed: Volunteers work to free the woman, who is believed to have been stuck for several hours 

Rescue: She is carried through the streets of the war-torn city, where fighting has intensified this week

Fighting near and inside the war-torn city has intensified this week as the army tries to seize territory north of the city in its ongoing battle against the Al-Qaeda-affiliated group Jabhat al-Nusra.

At least 48 fighters and family members were killed during last week's offensive against opposition-held areas in Aleppo, according to UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

However, Assad's military denied the killings and claimed it was the work of rebel forces.  

'I deny completely such an act that cannot be committed by the Syrian army whose duty is to protect lives and not kill people,' a military source told Reuters.

He said armed groups kill residents whom they suspect of being loyal or working with the government and accuse the army of committing the acts.

The victims were shot in their homes in the village of Raitan on Tuesday shortly after the village fell to the army and loyalist forces including Iranian fighters, the monitoring group reported. 

Five women and 10 children were among those killed, it added.Rami Abdul Rahman of the group, said his group confirmed the killings in the village from locals.  

The affiliation of those killed was not immediately clear. 

Destroyed: Drone footage shot by Al Jazeera reveals how the one prosperous city now lies in ruins

Bombed: Entire streets full of shops, public baths and residential properties are caked in dust from aerial shelling

Ceasefire: UN's special envoy to Syria will travel to the countryto try and negotiate a six-week suspension of government shelling and artillery strikes on the embattled Aleppo

Earlier today, drone footage emerged that has reveals the utter destruction inside the city - besieged by violent battles between government and rebel forces for more than three years.

The video shot by AJ+ shows how bath houses, shops and residential buildings in the once-thriving world heritage site now lie in complete ruin. 

The city has been carved in two since 2012, when opposition fighters launched an offensive to take control of the eastern half, while the government retained the west.

Whole neighborhoods are in rubble and opposition fighters now face a two-front war against the government and the Islamic State group.

The overall conflict in Syria has killed at least 220,000 people and sent more than 3.8 million people fleeing the country.

The fighting reportedly started when government forces launched a sudden offensive to recapture three extremist-held towns in Aleppo that can potentially cut off rebel routes deep into the city.

UN's special envoy to Syria will travel to the country this month to try and negotiate a six-week suspension of government shelling and artillery strikes on the embattled Aleppo.

It is unknown - and unlikely - that opposition forces will agree to the ceasefire proposed by Staffan de Mistura who says the government is open to the idea of a freeze in fighting. 

He said Damascus was willing to suspend aerial bombardment to test the possibility of a ceasefire in the city, where both Jihadists and other insurgents are battling the army and allied forces.

Armed: Rebels have taken to making their own ammunition - the latest of these weapons are gas cylinder howitzers, aptly nicknamed Hell Cannons

Howitzer: The rebel groups are said to take great pride in the cannon, which they developed themselves and has a range of about a mile

Death: At least 248 fighters - including 129 government soldiers and 119 rebels - have died in Aleppo since Tuesday according to UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights

But on Thursday, the regime said the success of a recent UN plan to freeze fighting in the city hinges on foreign states withdrawing their support for so-called insurgents.

Interior Minister Omran al-Zoabi claims the Syrian army has had more success against Islamic State and other militant groups than 'anything accomplished by a US-led alliance'.

It emerged this week that Syrian rebels are firing propane gas cylinders from howitzers as deadly battles with government forces continue.

With little access to weapons other than small arms such as machine guns, they have taken to making their own ammunition.

The latest of these weapons are gas cylinder howitzers, aptly nicknamed Hell Cannons, which on Wednesday were fired towards forces loyal to president Bashar Al-Assad in Aleppo. 

Almost four years into the conflict, the Syrian government is still fighting insurgents in the southern and northern regions of the country, in addition to ISIS which has declared its central city of Raqqa as its capital.

The United States and other allied nations have been carrying airstrikes on ISIS targets in Syria since September. But government officials have previously described their efforts as 'fruitless'.
