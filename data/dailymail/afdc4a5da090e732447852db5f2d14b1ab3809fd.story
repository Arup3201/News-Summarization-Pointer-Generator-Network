Chelsea are set to cash in on World Cup-winning misfit Andre Schurrle. Both Wolfsburg and Borussia Dortmund are in the running for the winger, who has struggled to make an impact at Stamford Bridge this season.

But far from a cut-price deal for a talented bench warmer, the Blues will expect compensation to the tune of £30million for Schurrle, who has made just five Premier League starts this season.

The move continues a trend of Chelsea getting top dollar for players unwanted since Jose Mourinho’s return and the introduction of FFP rules. Here, Sportsmail runs the rule over the big-name departures.

Andre Schurrle looks set to leave Chelsea before the end of the transfer window on February 2

Schurrle is wanted by both Wolfsburg and Borussia Dortmund back home in the Bundesliga

January 2014 – Kevin de Bruyne £18million

Hotly-touted De Bruyne never saw eye-to-eye with Mourinho since returning from a successful loan spell at Werder Bremen on the Portuguese manager’s return to Stamford Bridge.

Despite featuring in the first few matches of last season, the Belgian playmaker soon fell out of favour, with Mourinho slamming his attitude and performance in a Capital One Cup win at Swindon.

He barely featured for Chelsea again, the manager frequently becoming irritable in press conferences when asked about his non-appearances.

When the January transfer window rolled around, De Bruyne was first out the door, with Chelsea incredibly banking well over double their money for a player with just two league appearances to his name.

January 2014 – Juan Mata - £37million

A fans favourite straight from the off when arriving from Valencia in 2011, Mata lit up Stamford Bridge with his creativity, eye for goal and cheery demeanour.

The diminutive Spaniard led the Blues’ attacking play throughout his tenure of the No 10 shirt, picking up the FA Cup, the Champions League and the Europa League trophies along the way.

However, the Special One’s return was the beginning of the end for Special Juan. Mourinho had no time for Mata’s perceived lack of tracking back, and some anaemic displays saw Willian take his place in the side.

Enter Manchester United. David Moyes saw an opportunity to snap up an unhappy, albeit outrageously talented, player, but had to pay £37million for the privilege.

Mata has been good in fits and starts at Old Trafford, but is often touted as the odd man out in Louis van Gaal’s star-studded attacking line-up.

David Luiz cost PSG a staggering £50million

June 2014 – David Luiz - £50million

A player who polarised opinion at Stamford Bridge like no other. The big-haired Brazilian left fans in raptures with his fearless play, impeccable technique and larger-than-life personality.

Unfortunately, he also left fans with their heads in their hands at some of his ponderous positional play and dodgy defending.

Mourinho deployed Luiz in both defence and midfield last season to varying degrees of success. 

But when Paris St Germain came calling with an eye-watering £50million, there was no hesitation at Chelsea.

His World Cup performances alongside PSG clubmate Thiago Silva did nothing to disprove the notion that Chelsea got the deal of the century.

July 2014 – Romelu Lukaku - £28million

Hailed as the heir to Didier Drogba, Lukaku arrived at Stamford Bridge amid a flurry of hype as one of the most coveted teenagers in Europe.

Everton decided to part with £28million when signing Romelu Lukaku from Chelsea last summer 

Lukaku was brilliant on loan at Goodison Park last season but has since struggled for form

Goal-laden loan spells at West Brom and then Goodison Park had Chelsea fans looking on in anguish as their own misfiring strikers stunk out the Premier League.

But Mourinho had issues with Lukaku’s attitude and technique – the target man’s passing and first touch some way off what was required for the Chelsea attacking juggernaut.

Getting a shade under £30million for him from loan club Everton has proven to be a masterstroke. The Toffees have been a shadow of Roberto Martinez’s men last season, with the Belgian target man one of the worst culprits.
