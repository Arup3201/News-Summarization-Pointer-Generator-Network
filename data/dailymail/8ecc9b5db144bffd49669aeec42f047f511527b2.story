A gun enthusiast from Austria who was attending an SAS-style boot camp drove all the way to the Brecon Beacons with a car full of lethal weapons - and wasn't stopped by a single official.

Manuel Wallner boarded a ferry in Calais while his car was loaded with an arsenal of weapons, including a rifle, two semi-automatic guns and 280 rounds of ammunition.

The 23-year-old had enrolled on a 'close protection' course in the Welsh national park, where the most lethal weapon due to be used was a rubber knife.

But he decided to bring along his own huge collection of weapons - and managed to drive all the way to Crickhowell with them in tow.

Manuel Wallner, 23, boarded a ferry in Calais while his car was loaded with an arsenal of weapons, including a rifle, two semi-automatic guns and 280 rounds of ammunition - but his car was not checked by officials 

A judge at Swansea Crown Court today said there had been a 'gaping hole' in security that allowed Wallner to carry out his journey.

The court heard Wallner had declared his boot-full of weapons to officials on the French border - but had been waved onto the ferry without his car being inspected.

Officials failed to pass the message about his stash on to British authorities, meaning no one ever checked inside Wallner's car.

The young man only found himself being arrested when two fellow course goers reported him to the instructor after he boasted to them about his extensive collection.

The arsenal included a Steys Aug semi automatic .223 rifle, a semi automatic Beretta .9mm pistol,  knives, a tomahawk, extendable baton, gas mask, body armour and balaclavas. 

Speaking at Swansea Crown Court, judge Keith Thomas said: 'The facts are serious and worrying. If everything had worked properly that information should have been relayed to the UK.

'He was not stopped or questioned in anyway by the UK authorities. It is worrying. The real issue that disturbs me is that no-one appears to think that someone should have done something. I hope that something can be done about it.' 

Wallner appeared at the court for sentencing after admitting nine offences of possessing illegal weapons. 

During the hearing, the court heard Wallner, who had hoped to work in personal security in Iraq or South America, enrolled on the £4,200 close protection and hostile environment operation course run by the Blue Mountain Group.

The BMG told Wallner to bring with him necessary equipment such as warm and wet weather clothing. But Wallner decided to take along part of his personal collection of weapons.

Patrick Griffiths, prosecuting, said that had Wallner successfully applied in Austria for a European Firearms Pass, which would supposedly allow him to take guns into the UK.

Wallner was attending a £4,200 survival course in the Brecon Beacons, mid Wales (pictured) when his fellow course-goers grew concerned about his extensive weapon collection 

But Mr Griffiths said that in fact the pass did not override the laws of individual countries and that guns and ammunition were 'definitely illegal' in the UK.

He told the court that Wallner had informed border officials about the arms in the boot of his car when he arrived in Calais.

He was then told to wait until a member of the French forces spoke to him and inspected the guns, but the official did not turn up.

A representative of the French-owned firm myferrylink then told him to drive on to the boat, lock his car and give the keys to a crew member.

As the ship neared Dover, Wallner went back to his car, where he was given his keys back and told to 'drive on'.

Mr Griffiths said myferrylink had by then placed a 'Code 100' mark on Wallner's travel details, flagging up the contents of his car to the authorities.

The consequences should have been that the French security forces at least spoke to Wallner and told the British he was on his way, he added.

But in Dover, Wallner drove through the green 'nothing to declare' corridor without being stopped.

He then drove onto Llangynidr, a village at the foot of the Brecon Beacons 300 miles away.

There he was booked into the Coach House hotel, where he met fellow course goers Mark Wilson and Anthony Meachum.

Mr Griffiths told the court: 'They were surprised to discover he had brought with him an arsenal of weapons, ammunition and body armour. He made no secret about what he had, and even laid it all out in his bedroom for them to see.'

The two men, both ex-forces, became uneasy and told the instructor about the weapons, who called the police. 

Wallner was sentenced to 18 months' jail, suspended for two years, after telling Mr Thomas he planned to return to Austria as soon as possible. 

The judge told Wallner he accepted that he had 'declared the weapons to the French border authority and the ferry company'.

He also said he believed he had taken 'all reasonable steps to find out if he could bring the weapons into the UK'.   

Wallner's guns, ammunition, knives, tomahawk and baton were confiscated. He also lost his £4,200 course fee, and was ordered to pay a £100 government surcharge.

A spokesman for myferrylink said after the case: 'A Code 100 is a standard code used by all ferry companies to indicate there are firearms aboard a vehicle. It is for the authorities to take notice if they want to.'

A spokesman for the UK Border Force said it was the responsibility of the person importing the firearms into the country to notify the relevant authority.
