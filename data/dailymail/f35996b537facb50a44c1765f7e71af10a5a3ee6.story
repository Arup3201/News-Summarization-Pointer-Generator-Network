Roy Hodgson has risked upsetting Merseyside by making an ill-judged comment about Wayne Rooney’s Scouse accent.

The England manager, no stranger to controversial remarks, suggested that Rooney would not be able to stand up and lecture a room full of people because of his ‘Liverpool accent’.

When asked what Rooney was like as an orator, Hodgson said: ‘Oratory is a much over-exaggerated quality. There are some people I think are very eloquent who don’t get messages across well and others who I don’t think you would regard as orators who get their message across very well.

England manager Hodgson suggested Rooney would not be able to stand up and lecture a room of people

Rooney was born in Merseyside where he started his career with Everton before joining Manchester United

‘Everyone knows Wayne is not the sort of person, with his Liverpool accent, who is going to be able to stand up in front of a lecture room of people. 

'But he doesn’t need to. All he has to do is make certain the players he is talking to understand where he is coming from.’

The England manager’s most famous gaffe came in the ‘feed the monkey’ racism row when, at half-time of a World Cup qualifier against Poland, Hodgson urged Chris Smalling to pass to Andros Townsend, saying: ‘It’s like the old Nasa joke — feed the monkey’.

He also upset the mayor of Manaus on the eve of the World Cup draw when saying the Brazilian city was ‘the venue to be avoided’. 

And in 2012 he apologised after letting slip to a passenger on the tube that he had left Rio Ferdinand out of his next England squad.
