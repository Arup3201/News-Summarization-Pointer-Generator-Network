Engagements: Kate (pictured last month), who is around four and a half months pregnant, will return to work properly for the first time since before Christmas

The Duchess of Cambridge will be out and about displaying her blossoming baby bump starting from tomorrow with a series of public engagements.

Kate, who is around four and a half months pregnant, will return to work properly for the first time since before Christmas with a visit to an addiction centre in London tomorrow, followed by a ‘royal away day’ to Grimsby, Lincolnshire, on March 5.

In a far cry from her recent Caribbean holiday on the island of Mustique, tomorrow sees the 31-year-old royal visit Hope House, a 23-bed residential treatment centre in Clapham, south-west London, run by Action on Addiction, a charity of which she is patron.

The centre treats women recovering from substance abuse and other compulsive disorders, many of whom have a history of difficult relationships and find an all-female environment a more supportive place to tackle their issues.

Kate will meet staff and patients, all of whom are expected to have undergone initial detoxification, as well as learn more about the help they are given which includes daily workshops and one to one counselling sessions.

She is not expected to undertake any more public engagements, however, until March 5 when she will travel to Grimsby.

The town has been in decline since the 1950s, when it was the busiest fishing port in the world, but is still one of the largest centres for fish processing in this country.

Unsurprisingly, she will first visit the National Fishing Heritage Centre, where she will be given a personal guided tour of the museum by a local trawlerman.

She will learn more about Grimsby’s maritime and fishing heritage and have the opportunity to discuss issues  around the environmental sustainability of fishing in the North Sea – one of her father-in-law’s pet projects.

She will then go on to Humberside Fire and Rescue Service where, as well as meeting the on-duty firemen and women, she will talk to young people taking part in personal development courses run by Prince Charles’s charity, The Prince’s Trust.

Grimsby has one of the highest levels of youth unemployment in the country, with around one in three struggling to find a job.

The Prince’s Trust is now offering 12-week schemes for teenagers to help develop their team-building and CV writing skills.

As a result, three in four of those who complete the course move into work, education or training.

It is the first time that the Duchess has visited one of the charity’s programmes but it is understood that she has discussed its work with her father-in-law at length.

Her final engagement of the day will be to officially open Havelock Academy, established in 2007 by The David Ross Foundation, which serves more than 1,000 pupils aged between 11 and 18 in one of the most deprived areas in the country.

She will also receive a tour of the school, meet an A-level photography group – something the Duchess takes a keen personal interest in, having studied the subject herself – as well as view the sports facilities and an expressive arts display.

Kate will carry out all her newly-announced engagements without her husband, Prince William, who is putting off royal duties for the time being in order to concentrate on his ‘day job’ as an RAF Search and Rescue pilot at RAF Valley, North Wales.

Her decision to return to work suggests that she has recovered well from the severe pregnancy-related sickness, hyperemesis gravidarum, that blighted the early days of her pregnancy.

After being admitted to hospital in early December she cancelled all her forthcoming public engagements, save for a fleeting appearance at the Sports Personality of the Year award shortly before Christmas.

Since then she has only been seen officially in public once, when she viewed her first official portrait at the National Portrait gallery in London in early January, leading to questions being asked about her commitment to public duties.

Last week she and her husband issued a statement expressing their ‘disappointment’ that she had been photographed by paparazzi wearing a bikini while on holiday with her family in the Caribbean.

Although British media were effectively barred from publishing the pictures as they were taken on one of Mustique’s private beaches, the shots were run by magazines and other media around the world.

The couple were staying with their bodyguards in a luxurious £5million villa which boasts its own 64ft swimming pool.

The villa, which cost a staggering £19,000-a-week to rent, had a six-strong team of staff – including a chef – to tend to their every whim.

St James’s Palace declined to comment on the holiday, saying it was ‘private’.
