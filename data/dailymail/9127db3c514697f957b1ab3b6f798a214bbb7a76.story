Michael Gove yesterday told teachers they had never had it so good – as a fresh round of strikes was launched.

The Education Secretary said there was ‘no excuse’ for the industrial action that will close thousands of schools and disrupt the education of millions of children.

Mr Gove accused the leaders of the National Union of  Teachers and NASUWT of repeatedly peddling the damaging falsehood that teaching is a ‘depressing and demotivating activity’.

Reforms: Education Secretary Michael Gove said there was 'no excuse' for industrial action

He said: ‘The picture these union 
leaders paint is of a profession which no one rational would wish to 
join – a profession which is unattractive, unrewarding and unfulfilling.

'The truth, however, is very different. Teaching, as a profession, has 
never been more attractive, more popular or more rewarding.’

Members
of the NUT and NASUWT – which between them represent nine out of ten 
teachers – will take part in a walkout in the Eastern, East Midlands, 
West Midlands, Yorkshire and Humberside regions on October 1.

The NASUWT and NUT have announced two days of strikes at schools in England. The regions to be hit are:

October 1

East Midlands

West Midlands

Yorkshire and Humberside

Eastern region

October 17

North East

London

South East

South West

Those
in the North East, London, South East and South West will strike on 
October 17. The North West was hit by a strike in June.

A
national one-day walkout will follow, on a date to be announced, before
Christmas in the row over pay, pensions and workload.

The strikes will 
force many working parents to either pay for expensive childcare or take
a day’s holiday.

Teachers 
are being asked to fork out more for their pensions and ministers have 
scrapped annual rises in favour of performance-related pay.

Chris
Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, accused Mr Gove of being 
‘reckless and irresponsible’ and of engaging in ‘megaphone diplomacy’.

She added: ‘No one wants to be disrupting children’s education.

‘Our
experience is parents understand that if you attack teachers’ pay and 
conditions, you are putting at risk children’s education.’

Christine
Blower, general secretary of the NUT, said: ‘Some parents will be 
voluble and say strikes shouldn’t happen but actually we think, on 
balance, we have parental support.’

Frances
O’Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, claimed that 
strikes by teachers and state sector workers had ‘overwhelming’ support 
among the public.

But Chris
McGovern, of the Campaign for Real Education, said: ‘Most parents are 
going to deplore this strike action, not least because our primary 
school teachers are the fourth best paid in Europe.’

Mr Gove said: ‘There’s no excuse for going on strike. What is the complaint that teachers have? Is it that pensions are poor?

‘It
has been pointed out that even after recent changes, teachers have 
better pensions than the majority in the public and private sectors.’
