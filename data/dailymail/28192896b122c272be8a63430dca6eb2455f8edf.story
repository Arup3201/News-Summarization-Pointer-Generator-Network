Missing: Lizi Hamer is thought to have been on a trek across the mountain range but friends say she has not made contact since the disaster

Fears are growing for the safety of six British trekkers after they were caught in a snow storm that has claimed the lives of at least 32 in the Himalayas, according to local reports.

Hundreds of helpless tourists were buried as blizzards swept the Annapurna mountain range on Wednesday, setting off a series of devastating avalanches.

A total of six Britons are unaccounted for, including Lizi Hamer, 31, and her wife, Lisa Walton, a former Olympic hockey player, have not contacted their families since the storm struck on Tuesday.

Yesterday it emerged that the death toll could have been significantly higher but for the actions of British policeman Paul Sherridan, who led 150 fellow hikers to safety.

Nepalese authorities said two or three Britons were unaccounted for among those still stranded on the slopes, according to local reports.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it was not aware of any missing persons.

However, friends of advertising executive Lizi Hamer have made appeals for information on her whereabouts on the internet because she has not made contact since the disaster.

The 31-year-old, who is thought to be based in Singapore, had previously expressed an interest in tackling the Annapurna Circuit – a long-distance high-altitude trek – but it is not yet known whether she made it to the base. 

The names of any other Britons caught up in the disaster are not known.

Miss Hamer is believed to have travelled to the area with her partner Lisa Walton, a former New Zealand hockey player who she married in Australia last year.

Lisa Dillon, a friend of Miss Hamer, told The Times: ‘They are both great athletes and we are sure they did not have enough time to get to the affected area, but just want to hear from them.’

Miss Hamer graduated in graphic art and design from Leeds Metropolitan University in 2006 before moving to Australia the following year, where she embarked on a career in advertising. 

She has previously worked for advertising giant Saatchi & Saatchi, and was named in a poll of the ‘top 20 women to watch in Asia’.

The fitness enthusiast has also run the New York marathon and competed in an endurance event known as Ironman.

She posted a message on her Facebook page on Wednesday morning saying: ‘Let the trekking begin.’ And she last posted on Twitter at 3.15am on Wednesday but it is not yet known where she was when the message was sent.

The Annapurna Circuit is regarded as an ‘entry-level’ route that is generally safe and can be tackled by inexperienced hikers.

It attracts thousands of trekkers during its peak season in October when conditions are usually calm and conditions are safest. 

The freak storm this week developed when the tail end of a cyclone hit the region, causing temperatures to plunge. 

Teams scouring the slopes for survivors in helicopters rescued a group of 40 climbers at the highest point of the route yesterday.

Around 270 trekkers have been rescued so far but many more are thought to be stranded in huts and lodges on the slopes where they sought sanctuary.

A British survivor of the blizzard, who led 150 trekkers to safety, yesterday claimed that walkers on the mountain had been ‘herded to their deaths’ by guides.

Police officer Paul Sherridan said the disaster could have been prevented, and blamed guides for ignoring the weather forecast and failing to carry safety equipment in order to ‘lighten their load’.

The 49-year-old took the initiative when he saw disorientated mountaineers starting to freeze to death.

He battled through the storm for two hours to a less hostile position, believing that a group of ten hikers was following.

But the experienced hill-walker was stunned when he turned around to see 150 behind him.

He had joined around 100 trekkers on a three-week trip around the 150-mile Annapurna Circuit. On the morning of the disaster, the group was attempting to navigate the Thorung La pass, the highest section of the route.

Mr Sherridan, from Doncaster, described ‘gasping for air’ as the group was overcome with fear because of the black-out conditions.

Emerging from one of Nepal's worst mountaineering disasters, he said: "I saw a Nepalese boy and his face was frozen. There was sheer glass ice hanging on his cheek. I went across to him and I said 'Your face is frozen' and he said 'I know' and he began to cry and we both began to cry.

"I didn't know whether or not he was going to survive. The injuries to his face were horrific. 

"As I descended this abyss of nothing, I realised that the people I was following didn't know where they were. It was at that point that I realised I had gone from a place of safety into an absolute position of fear and sheer terror."

‘It was at that point that I realised I had gone from a place of safety into an absolute position of fear and sheer terror. Fortunately there was a brief respite and I saw a pole.’

He told the small group to follow the markers, making sure to keep track of the person on either side of them.

‘As we went further down, I realised it wasn’t just ten people, it was probably 150 people. I just stopped and I looked and I cried.’
