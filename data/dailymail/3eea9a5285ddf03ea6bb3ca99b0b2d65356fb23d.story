Escaped jail: Carer Leanne Edwards, 39, walked free from court yesterday despite being caught red-handed stealing cash from a frail great-grandmother

A carer who was caught red-handed stealing cash from a dementia-suffering great-grandmother after her suspicious family installed a spy camera has walked free from court. 

Leanne Edwards, 39, was filmed taking money belonging to frail Irene Goody, 85, by a concealed camera set up by the pensioner's son-in-law Edward Helps and wife Susan.

The couple said they were forced to turn detective after police told them they could do nothing to help because they were 'too busy and understaffed'.

Mr Helps, 61, then bought a £120 secret recording device off the internet and set it up at the sheltered flat in Droitwich, Worcestershire.

Despite damning footage capturing Edwards rifling through Irene's drawers and pocketing cash from her purse the care worker avoided prison yesterday.

She was handed handed a 14-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months at Worcester Magistrates Court.

District Judge Nigel Cadbury said there was 'no point' sending Edwards to prison immediately because of her vulnerable state.

He said: 'You have got previous convictions for dishonesty, so you can clearly be described as dishonest.

'The facts of this case are particularly harrowing. You were supposed to care for an 85-year-old woman who is unable to care for herself.

'It took surveillance cameras to catch you at it. You admitted the offence, but you still did not plead guilty until the day of the trial.

'Anybody reading about this case will think is is abhorrent. What you have done has easily crossed the custody threshold.

'I have no idea why previous magistrates suggested otherwise. They just have been reading the wrong guidelines.

Caught in the act: Edwards was seen on camera stealing from dementia sufferer Irene Goody, 85, after Mrs Goody's family became concerned that money was going missing and set up a CCTV camera in her flat

'Anybody reading about this must know that stealing from an 85-year-old woman could results them going to prison, it must be a deterrent.

'But there is no point sending someone with your emotional and physical issues to prison, into an environment that will only exacerbate the problem.

'Some people reading about this may think I am being soft, but there is no point sending you away for what will be a very short period of time.'

The court heard Edwards had been privately employed by the family of Mrs Goody - who is in the early stages of dementia - to visit her every evening.

She was entrusted with making sure the retired seamstress, who has eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren, had taken her daily medication.

Prosecutor Jackie Rogers said the family first noticed something was wrong when money started going missing last March.

Let off: District Judge Nigel Cadbury said there was 'no point' sending Edwards to prison immediately because of her vulnerable state

She added: 'Mrs Helps replaced the money but she received a call from the warden for the place where her mother lived saying that her mother was very distressed that money for a meal out had gone missing from her purse.

'She asked he husband to instal some cameras and they were put in in August when he mother was asleep so as not to notify her to their presence.

'When the defendant was arrested she admitted to taking the money, but claimed that she had been given permission to take it by Mr Edwards.

'I believe that is the defence she planned on using in court.

'She did not change her guilty plea until the very last minute, the afternoon of the trial in fact.

'The surveillance footage shows her taking the money.

'At one point the defendant even called Mrs Helps and claimed the money she was owed for caring duties had also gone missing.

'This is aggravated by the fact that the theft was from a dwelling, and is in particularly distressing circumstances.'

Joanne Outhwaite, defending, said Edwards had been through an abusive relationship and money troubles and had used the money to pay off debts.

She added: 'She doesn't want to use this as an excuse.

'She understands what she did and the distress she caused. She was on the verge of losing her home and had suffered a major illness that stopped her working.

'She used the money to pay for living costs.'

Position of trust: Edwards had been privately employed by the family of Mrs Goody - who is in the early stages of dementia - to visit her every evening

The thefts took place at The Heriotts sheltered housing in Worcestershire where Edwards had been privately employed by the family to come in and help Mrs Goody. The home's managers assisted the investigation

Edwards, from Droitwich, had pleaded guilty to stealing £120 between May and September last yea at an earlier hearing on January 19.

After the case Mr Helps, a company director, said: 'It's a bit disappointing really, it doesn't send out the strongest message.

'She was in a position of trust and she severely breached that trust, we would have liked to have seen a stronger sentence but more than anything we wanted people to know what she had done.

'Hopefully that way, it won't happen to other people in future and make people think twice about committing similar crimes.'

Edwards was also ordered to pay £120 compensation, an £85 victim surcharge and £620 in costs, as well as undergo a 12 month community order.
