Cardinal Keith O'Brien has hit out at plans for gay marriage

Britain's most senior Roman Catholic cleric has likened gay marriage to slavery.

Cardinal Keith O’Brien, leader of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland has recently made a series of controversial statements in the media about same sex unions.

When interviewed on Radio 4, Cardinal 
O'Brien said countries which legalise gay marriage are 'shaming 
themselves' by going against the 'natural law.'

He also claimed same sex unions were the 'thin end of the wedge' and would lead to the 'further degeneration of society into immorality.'

At the weekend Cardinal 
O'Brien wrote in newspaper article:

'Imagine for a moment that the Government had decided to legalise slavery but assured us that ‘no one will be forced to keep a slave’.

'Would such worthless assurances calm our fury? Would they justify dismantling a fundamental human right? Or would they simply amount to weasel words masking a great wrong?' he commented in the Sunday Telegraph.

He has also launched a scathing attack on David Cameron’s pledge to legalise homosexual marriage, branding it ‘madness’ and ‘grotesque’.

Cardinal O’Brien,accused the Prime Minister of attempting to ‘redefine marriage’ for a ‘small minority of activists’.

And he insisted that the reforms would ‘shame the United Kingdom in the eyes of the world.' 

The Prime Minister is a strong supporter of plans to legalise same-sex marriage, which will be formally unveiled later this month.

But the proposal has divided the Conservative Party and put Mr Cameron on a collision course with religious leaders.

Cardinal O’Brien said: ‘Since all the legal rights of marriage are already available to homosexual couples, it is clear this proposal is not about rights but rather is an attempt to redefine marriage at the behest of a small minority of activists. 

‘If marriage can be redefined so that it no longer means a man and a woman but two men or two women, why stop there? Why not allow three men, or a woman and two men, to constitute a marriage, if they pledge their fidelity to one another?’

David Cameron is a supporter of the plans to legalise gay marriage which will be unveiled by the equalities minister and Lib Dem MP Lynn Featherstone this month

In 2005, civil partnerships were introduced for gay couples but by law they cannot be referred to as marriages.

Cardinal O’Brien is the latest among senior clergy to denounce the Government’s backing for marriage to include gay couples.

In January, the Anglican Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, insisted governments did not have the moral authority to redefine marriage, and in an article for the Daily Mail last month, Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, wrote: ‘Marriage precedes both the state and the church, and neither of these institutions have the right to redefine it in such a fundamental way.’

The Rev Sharon Ferguson, a pastor of the Metropolitan Community Church, and her partner Franka Strietzel, has fought for same sex marriage

The Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, wants to stop gay clergymen becoming bishops

If the law is changed, Britain will 
become the seventh European country to recognise same-sex marriage, 
after the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Spain, Portugal and Norway.

Tory MP Peter Bone, who has called the plans ‘completely nuts’, yesterday suggested the proposals were hatched following a ‘backroom deal’ with the Liberal Democrats.

But his colleague Margot James, the first openly lesbian Conservative MP, said: ‘The Government is not trying to force churches to perform gay marriages. It is a purely civil matter.’

Ben Summerskill, of the  gay rights group Stonewall, said: ‘If Roman Catholics don’t approve of same-sex marriage they should make sure they don’t get married to someone of the same sex.’

A Home Office spokesman said the Government believed that a couple should ‘have the option of a civil marriage irrespective of their sexual orientation’.
