A family is mourning the loss of a second twin daughter struck by an allegedly drunk driver who had an Alcoholics Anonymous leaflet on his back seat.

Janesah Goheen, 17, passed away on Monday - 11 days after her identical twin, Janeah, was killed in the crash in Oak Hill, Washington as the girls drove with a friend to visit a haunted house.

In a heartbreaking twist, it is the third tragedy for the family, who lost another daughter - 23-year-old Jessica Goheen Thorn - in May 2008 to a car wreck.

Janesah had been driving their 1993 Acura at 5pm on Halloween when it was hit head-on by a Ford Mustang driven by 53-year-old Ira Blackstock and was rushed to hospital in serious condition.

Her progress had given her family hope, KIRO-TV, reported, but she succumbed to her injuries on Monday at Harborview Medical Center surrounded by family and friends.

The twins' pastor, Russell Schlecht, told the station there was some comfort in the death.

'This is the longest they've been apart,' he said. 'One being taken 
instantly, one enduring as long as she could.

'As awful as it is, I'm glad they're together right now. There's a beauty to it. A sense there this needed to happen.'

The family had planned to hold a memorial for Janeah on Saturday and will now be remembering Janesah there too.

Troopers said Blackstock had crossed the centerline on Highway 20 in his Mustang and 
slammed into their car. Police say Blackstock appears to have been accelerating at the time of impact.

The damage was so severe that the girls had to be cut from their vehicle.

Janeah, who was seated in the back of car, was killed in the 
accident while the twins' close friend Alysha Pickler, 18, was sitting in the front passenger seat and suffered a concussion.

When authorities arrived on the scene, Blackstock allegedly showed signs of impairment and a blood sample was taken to test his blood alcohol level.

Impaired: Toxicology are pending but officers say Blackstock appeared impaired and found this flier in the back of his car

Police
are awaiting the toxicology results but Blackstock is likely to face 
charges of vehicular homicide and vehicular assault. He is being held on 
$70,000 bail.

An Alcoholics Anonymous brochure and a Bible were found in 
the backseat of his car.

Blackstock suffered minor injuries and was arrested after his release from hospital.

According to KING 5, the twins sang in perfect harmony at their local church and often finished each other's sentences.

Oak Harbor School District communications officer Kellie Tormey told the Skagit Valley Herald: 'It's a shocking tragedy for us.'

Tormey said the Goheen twins had attended Oak Harbor High School and HomeConnections, the home-school program.

They
had many friends at the school and Tormey said a crisis response team 
was at the school and will return to help students and staff deal with the losses.

The Goheen family has two other surviving daughters.
