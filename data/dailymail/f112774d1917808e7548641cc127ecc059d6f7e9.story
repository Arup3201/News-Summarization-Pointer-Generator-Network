Little Lindsey is only a year old. So when the baby girl's previously bearded dad appeared clean-shaven for the first time, it's not surprising she was slightly confused.

A video posted on YouTube shows Lindsey's dad - who had sported a beard the whole of his daughter's life - holding his little girl after shaving off all of his facial hair.

Lindsey appears a little perplexed and carefully touches her dad's chin and face in what looks like an attempt to figure out where his beard has disappeared to.

Her father says: 'Hey baby girl', but Lindsey still seems a little unsure of who this is is holding her.

But rather than freaking out at this apparent stranger, the little girl then tenderly presses her nose against her dad's chin to sniff his face. 

She then gives a little smile in apparent recognition and brushes her nose against her dad's.

The adorable video posted by Lindsey's parents in Hiram, Georgia, has already racked up close to 100,000 views on YouTube.
