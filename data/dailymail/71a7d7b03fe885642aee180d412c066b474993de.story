Arsenal have made an enquiry for Bayer Leverkusen defensive midfielder Lars Bender.

The Germany man, who missed the World Cup through injury, is Arsene Wenger's primary midfield target this summer having failed to sign him last summer.

Leverkusen are reluctant to sell Bender, 25, having only recently tied him down to a new long term contract.

But Arsenal have made contact with their German counterparts about a potential swoop.

Southampton's Morgan Schneiderlin and Real Madrid midfielder Sami Khedira are on Wenger's back-up list if Bender cannot be signed.

Khedira, 27 remains part of Carlo Ancelotti's plans in Spain and the Gunners will find it hugely difficult to lure him away from the European champions.

The 24-year-old Schneiderlin, however, is likely to be easier to land and seems a far more realistic signing should their move for Bender fail.

In addition, Arsenal will hope to 
wrap up moves for Barcelona forward Alexis Sanchez and Newcastle 
defender Mathieu Debuchy this week, although they may face competition from Juventus for Chile star Sanchez.

Moving on: Mathieu Debuchy arrived back in Paris with his French team-mates after their World Cup exit

Arsenal have agreed a £34million deal in principle with Barcelona for Chile international forward Alexis Sanchez but Barcelona are waiting to see if Juventus can match the offer.

Sanchez has indicated he does not want to join Liverpool despite their efforts to persuade him and Brendan Rodgers being keen to speak to the player.

That will mean a straight cash deal for Luis Suarez from Barcelona.
