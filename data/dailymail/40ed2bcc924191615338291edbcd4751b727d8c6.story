They are photographs which heap shame on some of the world's biggest multi-national companies.

As Bangladesh struggles to come to terms with the deaths of 111 workers in the deadliest blaze in the country's history, new photographs have emerged showing how some of the West's biggest firms had their clothes made at the factory.

Garments made in the Tazreen factory for major multi-nationals have been found by people searching through the wreckage of the fire. The blaze has provoked anger among campaigners who want better safety conditions in Bangladesh's garment factories.

Evidence: The Director of The Bangladesh Center for Workers Solidarity Kalpona Akter poses with a garment with the logo 'Faded Glory' owned by Wal-Mart. It was found in the Tazreen factory

Discovery: This garment found in the aftermath of the blaze which killed 111 workers shows a garment with with the logo Enyce, which is owned by hip hop star Sean Diddy Combs

According to Quartz, companies which appear to have been using the factory include Enyce, Dickies, C&A, Wal-Mart and Sears.

The photographs emerged as protesters took to the streets for a 
second day and garment factories across the world's 
second-biggest clothes exporter stopped work to mourn.

Saturday's fire has put a spotlight on 
global retailers which source clothes from Bangladesh, where the cost of 
labour is low - as little as $37 a month for some workers - and rights 
groups have called on firms to sign up to a fire safety program.

Among the lables found include those of Faded Glory, which is Wal-Mart's main fashion line.

Speaking to Quartz,  Wal-Mart said, 
'The Tazreen factory was no longer authorized to produce merchandise for
Wal-Mart.

Found: These 'Enyce' clothes lie within the burnt out garment manufacturing building in Dhaka

'A supplier subcontracted work to this factory without 
authorization and in direct violation of our policies.  Today, we have 
terminated the relationship with that supplier.'

Enyce is owned by hip hop star Sean Diddy Combs who bought it in 2008 from Liz Claiborne.  Quartz said requests for comments from Enyce and Sean John - another fashion line owned by Combs - were not returned.

Dickies is a popular brand which sells work clothes and is based in Fort Worth, Texas. Speaking to Quartz, a spokesman said it had concluded its production schedule with the factory earlier this year.

C&A, a European discount clothing
retailer, confirmed the destroyed factory was producing an order of 
220,000 sweaters for its operations in Brazil. One of its brands is 
called ACE.

It said in a statement it feels a deep sense of solidarity with the families who lost relatives in the fire.

U.S. retailer Sears Holdings Corp said 
its clothing was not meant to be made in that textile factory, and was 
investigating reports that one of its brands had been found in the 
charred debris.

Other brands, such as Esprit Holdings Ltd , continued to
deny any connection and distanced themselves from the disaster.

Sears also 
suggested something illicit may have taken place.

'Any merchandise 
found at that factory should NOT have been manufactured there and we are
currently investigating further,' the company said in a statement.

The International Labor Rights Forum, in a
statement on Sunday, said evidence discovered in the factory suggested 
Sears' True Desire line may have been manufactured there, as well as 
other prominent brands.

The country's worst-ever industrial blaze
consumed a multi-story building of a Tazreen Fashions factory. More 
than 150 workers were injured.

The interior minister, Mohiuddin Khan
Alamgir, said that, according to a preliminary inquiry, the fire was 
the result of arson. He promised to bring the culprits to justice.

'We
have come to the conclusion that it was an act of sabotage. We are 
finding out as of now who exactly the saboteurs are and all culprits 
will be brought to book,' Alamgir said.

Earlier, Prime Minister 
Sheikh Hasina said she suspected the fire was an act of sabotage, but 
she did not identify any suspect or say why she thought the cause might 
have been arson.

As of Tuesday afternoon, a petition on 
Change.org calling on major retailers to join an industry fire safety 
program for suppliers had more than 13,000 supporters.

Representatives of the Tazreen Fashions factory, including the owner, were not available for comment.

Two further incidents outside Dhaka - a fire at a factory on Monday morning and an explosion at a factory on Tuesday evening - had local manufacturers worried that their industry was being deliberately targeted.

Annisul Huq, former president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said that the series of incidents naturally raises questions.

Bangladesh
has about 4,500 garment factories and is the world's biggest exporter 
of clothing after China, with garments making up 80 percent of its $24 
billion annual exports.

Working conditions at Bangladeshi factories 
are notoriously poor, with little enforcement of safety laws. 
Overcrowding and locked fire doors are common.

More than 300 
factories near the capital were shut for almost a week earlier this year
as workers demanded higher wages and better conditions. At least 500 
people have died in garment factory accidents in Bangladesh since 2006, 
according to fire brigade officials.

More than 1,000 workers, some 
carrying black flags, demonstrated Tuesday in the Ashulia industrial 
belt on the outskirts of the capital where the factory is located. They 
blocked traffic moving on a highway and vowed to avenge the deaths of 
their colleagues, witnesses said.

'Never shall we give up demands for punishment for those responsible for the tragedy,' one worker said.

Dhaka
district police chief Habibur Rahman told Reuters his men were 
investigating complaints from some survivors that factory managers 
stopped workers from running out of the building when a fire alarm went 
off.

The pictures were provided to Quartz by the International Labor Rights Forum  ( ILRF) which campaigns for better working conditions in a number of countries, including Bangladesh.

According to ILRF, the photographs were taken by the Bangladesh Center for Worker Solidarity and the Bangladesh Garments and Industrial Workers Federation.
