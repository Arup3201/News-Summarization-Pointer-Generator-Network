Up to 750,000 people could die from famine in East Africa over the next four months, the United Nations has warned.

The UN says some 12 million people across the region, and four million in Somalia alone, are in need of food aid.

The top humanitarian official for Somalia says getting aid to the starving is a 'race against time' and warned the famine is likely to spread before the end of the year.

Mark Bowden, who heads the UN office coordinating humanitarian aid to Somalia, said: 'This isn't a short-term crisis.'

There are fears as many as 750,000 people could starve to death unless enough aid reaches the stricken region.

This is a rise of 66 per cent from July. Hundreds of Somalis are dying every day, at least half of which are children.

Mr Bowden said the four million Somalis in need of aid represented more than half of the country's entire population.

The southern Bay region is the latest to be declared a famine zone.

Nearly 60 per cent of people there are acutely malnourished - four times the rate at which an emergency is declared.

Grainne Moloney, the head of the food security unit, said: 'I've not seen anything like it.'

Famine has now affected six areas, including four southern Somali regions and two settlements of refugees.

The U.N. says tens of thousands of people already have died in Somalia due to the severe violence, drought and famine.

More than 150,000 refugees have sought aid in the last few months. Families in Kenya, Ethiopia and Djibouti have also been affected.

Somalia has been hit hardest, its problems compounded by more than 20 years of civil war and Islamist insurgents that banned many aid agencies, including the UN's World Food Program, from their territory.

The Islamists hold much of Somalia's southern agricultural region.

Ms Maloney said a bad drought meant that harvests there are a quarter of normal levels - the worst for 17 years.

The price of a day's casual labour has dropped from 33 pounds (15kg) of cereal to seven pounds (3kg), she said.

Mr Bowden said access to areas in the south held by the al-Shabab insurgent militia was improving and that there were some aid agencies that were able to work there.

'There's a far greater level of coverage than we anticipated,' he said.

The UN food agency is concentrating on the areas of Somalia it does have access to - which includes about 1.9million people.

It is encouraging donors to fund other agencies who had access to southern areas, spokeswoman Challiss McDonough said.
