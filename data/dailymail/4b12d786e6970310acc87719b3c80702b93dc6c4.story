The levy is predicted to reduce the number of bags handed out at tills by more than 70 per cent

Chancellor George Osborne is under pressure to hand over a £19million-a-year VAT windfall from introducing a 5p charge on carrier bags.

The Treasury would be in line to collect 20 per cent VAT, or 1p, on the 5p charge, due to come into effect in England next year. 

The levy is predicted to reduce the number of bags handed out at tills by more than 70 per cent. It will also raise some £70million a year for green charities, including those tackling litter. 

The VAT element would raise £19million a year from shoppers, according to the Government.

But
 the Environmental Audit Committee, dominated by Conservative MPs, says 
today that this sum should be handed back to green good causes, such as 
cleaning parks and waterways.

The
 all-party group of MPs also said that plans for the levy in England 
have been a ‘complete mess’ after ministers proposed several exemptions 
and red tape rules.

Its 
report today said: ‘The VAT on the charge should also be spent on new 
environmental projects and on monitoring the impact of the scheme.’

The Treasury is already collecting VAT
 on the 5p charge in Wales, which already has the levy, and will also do
 so when the scheme starts in Scotland in October.

Consequently, its windfall from the charge is even higher than £19million.

The introduction of the levy  is a victory for the Daily Mail’s Banish the Bags campaign.

More than eight billion disposable bags are used in England each year, or 130 bags per person.

For Wales, this fell to 22 after the levy was introduced in October 2011. Its scheme is simple in that all retailers, regardless of size, charge a 5p levy on all single-use carrier bags.

But ministers insist that in England 
there should be no 5p charge for biodegradable or paper bags, and small 
shops – those employing fewer than 250 people – will be exempt.

The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) says this is to reduce the regulatory burden on small shops.

But the Association of Convenience Stores, which represents small shops, said its members would be happy to apply the levy.

EAC chairman Joan Walley MP urged ministers to ‘keep it simple to help shoppers do the right thing’.

Current Government policy means the 5p charge will not be introduced in England until October 2015 at the earliest

She added: ‘Ministers have managed to make a complete mess of their planned carrier bags charge by making it unnecessarily complicated.’

The committee said there is no value in exempting paper bags because they can have a greater impact on the environment than plastic versions.

Miss Walley added: ‘Biodegradable bags are not as green as they sound.

We heard they can do as much harm to wildlife as normal plastic bags and could cause big problems for the UK recycling industry.’ 

Dr Sue Kinsey, of the Marine Conservation Society, said the plan to exempt small shops, paper and biodegradable bags was ‘ludicrous’.

But a Defra spokesman said: ‘Paper bags make up only a small proportion of carrier bags and break down naturally. Biodegradable bags will only be exempt if they are genuinely biodegradable – currently such a bag does not exist.’
