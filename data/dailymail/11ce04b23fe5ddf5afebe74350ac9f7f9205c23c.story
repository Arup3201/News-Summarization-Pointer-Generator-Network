Busy shop tills will be the sound ringing in the New Year as a financial report released Tuesday has predicted that small businesses in Australia can expect bumper profits over Christmas.

The Commonwealth Bank’s biannual SME (small and medium enterprises) Confidence Report has revealed that these businesses have every reason to feel optimistic over the coming weeks. 

Some 87 per cent of SMEs think business conditions will improve or stay the same over next six months, with 76 per cent expecting customer demand to be higher or the same as last year, and 43 per cent expecting revenue and profit to be up on last year.

The report measures confidence among Australian businesses with an annual turnover of $500,000 to $10 million and examines the main challenges and opportunities surrounding these businesses in the current economic environment.

When asked about business conditions in general over the next six months, the majority of business owners said they were feeling positive.

Owner and operator Bianca Kristallis believed that preparation was everything.

'Businesses can gauge early on from the enquiries and pre-orders made if they are going to have a busy Christmas or not,' Kristallis said.

'Australian businesses have woken up to the need to be on the ball early at Christmas time. Christmas started for us in early October. It’s the money-making season.

'If businesses are not ready for the Christmas market by September or October then they’ll miss the boat. Online businesses are increasing every year and you just need to be ready and have your systems in place.'

Dependability is also a major factor with customers as it means they can rely on the business in question to maintain a high standard of customer service.

'We do a lot of research and development, and we've found that customers want to be able to trust us. They want to leave their gifts in our hands and trust us to deliver them without any problems,' Kristallis explained.

'This year our Christmas market is booming. The positive thing about our style of business is that we choose to go online rather than go bricks and mortar, so we don’t have that bricks and mortar pressure.'Because we’re in a digital space we get a lot of comeback customers from last year.

However, the report also found that almost half (47%) of the businesses said that economic conditions in Australia are a concern, with 39 per cent saying global economic conditions were having a negative impact on their overall business confidence. While 52 per cent of businesses have no insight into their customer's likely spending patterns. Despite this Adam Bennett, Executive General Manager Local Business Banking for Commonwealth Bank, believed the findings indicated that SMEs have high expectations for this Christmas trading period and are generally feeling confident as we head towards 2015. 

However the important message for SMEs is to be prepared.

'Given the significance of the Christmas trading period, it’s important that businesses ensure they are well prepared to capitalise on increased customer demand. 

'With six weeks until Christmas, there is time to put the right plans and resources in place to meet their customer needs and make the most of a bumper Christmas,' said Bennett. 

Reliability is one of the main reasons why Pamper Hamper is a success, says owner Bianca Kristallis
