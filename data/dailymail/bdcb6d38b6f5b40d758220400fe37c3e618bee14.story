A paedophile Scout leader who invited boys to his home before plying them with alcohol and sexually abusing them was caught after a victim saw him posing with children in a local paper.

Married Nick Thorpe, 48, was jailed for 14 years at Portsmouth Crown Court for preying on members of the group between 1996 and 2005.

He was caught when one victim - now in his 30s - saw this photo of the pervert surrounded by young Scouts in newspaper, Portsmouth News, and reported him to the police.

Judge Roger Hetherington gave Thorpe 13 years for these crimes in March, when he was convicted of three counts of rape, one of assault, one of indecent assault and one of gross indecency.

Following the trial, two further victims came forward alleging that they too had been abused by him as children.

Thorpe, from Portsmouth, Hants, was then convicted of an additional two counts of gross indecency with a child and one count of indecent assault.

He was sentenced to a further three years for these offences, two of which will run concurrently and one consecutively, taking the time he is due to serve to 14 years.

The Scout master of 27 years was also made to sign the Sex Offenders Register.

PC Owen Woods, from Hampshire 
Constabulary, said: 'I would like to acknowledge the extreme courage 
displayed by the victims in this case.

'They have shown extreme courage in coming forward and speaking out about the very traumatic offences committed against them.

'They have also been brave in going to court and giving evidence.

'Without their commitment and support this conviction would not have been possible.

'Nicholas Thorpe has now been 
convicted by a jury for the second time this year in relation to sexual 
offences he has committed against child Scouts in his care.

'This is an abhorrent abuse of power and position by a man who was trusted by parents to look after their children.
