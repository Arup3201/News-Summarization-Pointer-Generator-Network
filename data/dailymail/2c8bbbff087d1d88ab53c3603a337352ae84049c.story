West Ham have completed their first signing of the January transfer window with the capture of Canada international Doneil Henry.

The Hammers announced the transfer of the 21-year-old defender via their official club website on Saturday.

Henry, who has 14 caps for his country, joins on a long-term contract from Cypriot First Division club Apollon Limassol for an undisclosed fee.

The 6'2 defender has been closely monitored by the Irons for a while after having already spent two periods training with the club in recent months.

Henry was brought to Upton Park boss Sam Allardyce's attention by Toronto FC head coach Ryan Nelsen.

Former defender Nelsen, who played under Allardyce at Blackburn Rovers, recommended the talented Henry after having seen him become the first player to graduate from the MLS side's academy.

'Ryan (Nelsen) was my captain at Blackburn for a couple of years and he rang us and told us about Doneil,' Allardyce told West Ham's official website.

'He said this lad definitely has Premier League potential and he has everything he needs.

'With a little coaching from us and work in terms of how to defend in the Premier League, Ryan says he has all the attributes to be a good player.

'We have invested in him for the near future, so we do hope he can make some sort of appearance this season if he settles in and does as well as Ryan thinks he will. If not, we hope he is certainly one for the future.'

Henry, who goes straight into the Hammers' first-team squad, is hoping to settle in quickly at his new club.

'It feels good to be given the opportunity to come and train and see what it's like to be part of a Premier League team and I just want to get started and get into the team real soon,' he said.

'I had a really good relationship with Ryan Nelsen and I always wanted to see what it was like to play at another level, the highest level, and I got the opportunity to come over here. Since then, I was just hoping to come back and now it's happened, I want it to continue on and keep playing.

'I started with the Toronto FC Academy when I was 16 and signed for the first-team when I was 17 and now I just want to continue to develop and keep growing as a player. I'm 21 and I want to get a role with the team, keep my head down and take my opportunity when I can.

'I love a tackle and I just want to defend hard. I take pride in my clean sheets with the back line and with the 'keeper, so if we can just do that, it's job completed.'
