A nine-year-old boy  found hanged in his bedroom  suffered neglect, witnessed domestic abuse and had been involved with social services for years, a serious case review has found.

The victim, named only as Gavin, was just eight days away from his tenth birthday when his younger sibling found him unconscious in his bedroom in August last year.

When paramedics arrived at the address there were no working lights on the upper floor of the family home, and they had to fetch a bulb from downstairs. 

Gavin was taken to hospital, but died nine months later.

Now a report into his death has highlighted a series of 'missed opportunities' to help the youngster, from Stockton, Teesside.

The nine-year-old boy, known only as Gavin, hanged himself in August last year. A report into his death revealed he had witnessed domestic violence, had been neglected, and was involved with social services for years

The serious case review described Gavin as a popular boy at school and a 'beautiful singer', though the deputy headteacher of his local said he 'had a sad face, even when he was happy.'

Gavin and his family had been involved with different agencies in Stockton including Health, Social Care and Police going back to 2005, and had previous contact with social services in Durham.

He had been the subject of a child protection plan on three separate occasions due to neglect, although at the time he was found hanged the family were not involved with Children's Services.

He had been briefly fostered in 2006 over concerns about neglect and domestic violence in the home, which he ha witnessed.

His school raised questions in May last year about his 'unkempt' appearance, and staff reported he appeared withdrawn and malnourished. 

His bad body odour was later found to be caused by the family's broken washing machine which was not quickly replaced.

Despite these concerns, Mike Harrison, the independent author of the report, blasted the professionals involved with Gavin for 'collective inaction' in the first half of 2013.

The report criticised their decision to end his child protection programme in 2012 as 'unwise' and 'insufficiently supported by evidence'.

Gavin was never interviewed alone about his condition, and not enough was done to stop his parents putting pressure on him during questioning, the report concluded.

Protection plans drawn up for Gavin and his siblings were 'insufficiently robust' and did not include enough details on 'what needed to change in the family'.

Authorities were also unaware of the past history of Gavin's father because he had two surnames. 

This information could have given further insight into the father's 'ability to parent Gavin successfully', Mr Harrion wrote.

The report also found a lack of communication between some of the agencies involved, with some excluded from Gavin's assessments.

Some child protection workers also lacked knowledge about programmes to help domestic violence and abuse perpetrators.

Despite this, the review concluded that nothing could have been done to save Gavin, as he had no history of self-harm and had expressed no desire to take his own life. 

The report says that there 'was no information or indication given to professionals or agencies throughout the period of this review, or before, that would give rise to concerns that Gavin would in any way harm himself deliberately'.

It added that it was 'clear the events which occurred on August 8, 2013, could not have been anticipated by any of the professionals or agencies who were or had been involved with Gavin'.

The incident was investigated by the police, who were clear that Gavin’s injuries were caused by his own actions and did not involve a third party.

Report accuses some child care professionals from Middesbrough (pictured) of 'collective inaction' over Gavin in the early part of 2013, and said the decision to withdraw his support programme in 2012 was 'unwise'

Colin Morris, the independent chair of the Stockton-on-Tees Local Safeguarding Children Board, said: 'This was a tragic incident, and our thoughts are very much with Gavin’s family at this time. 

'Gavin did not have a history of self-harm. The independent review is clear that the events which occurred that day could not have been anticipated by any of the professionals or agencies who were or had been involved with Gavin and his family. 

'The purpose of a Serious Case Review is to ensure that lessons are learned, and the independent author has made a number of recommendations to improve multi-agency working.

'Some of these recommendations have already been implemented while a number of others are well under way.'

Those recommendations include a review of commissioned support services, which assist children in need and children in need of protection.

Staff should also be better informed about what programmes can be used to help those at risk of causing domestic abuse. 

There should also be a comprehensive  review of record keeping, including the required content of records, security and access to records.
