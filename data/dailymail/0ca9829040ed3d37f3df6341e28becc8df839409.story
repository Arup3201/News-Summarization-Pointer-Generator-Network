The violence that broke out at the Sandy Hook Elementary School continues to shock: images of the little faces and the heroic teachers who tried
desperately to save their students have pierced the hearts of people worldwide.

As the grief-stricken families are laying to rest the loved
ones stolen from them in the tragedy on December 14 – the small town of Bath, Michigan is standing in solidarity with the people of Newtown as the
Connecticut community struggles to move forward after being shaken to the core by the unspeakable
violence.

The Midwest town, just 20 miles from Lansing, was the site of
the most deadly school violence in U.S. history, when in May 1927 a trustee
from the local school board wired the school with 600 pounds of dynamite and then detonated the explosive, killing 45 people, 38 of whom were children.

Damage: Andrew Kehoe had outfitted the school building with 600 pounds of dynamite which caused massive damage to the structure, only 100 pounds actually exploded. 45 people were killed, 38 of whom were children

Bath has been described as the 'quintessential American
small town,' by author Arnie Bernstein
who profiled the devastating attack at the Bath Consolidated School in his 2009 book, 'Bath Massacre:
America’s First School Bombing.'

The perpetrator of the horrifying crime, Andrew Kehoe, was a
trustee on the local school board and planned the gruesome attack after he had contentious arguments with the school
superintendent, Emery Hyuck.

Mr Bernstein researched the incident and spent significant
time with the survivors of the attack, telling the MailOnline that Kehoe was an 'evil genius' who methodically prepared over the course of several months.

As a
trained electrician and a farmer, the man was one of the few people equipped to repair the generator that powered the school in the rural community and he was
given unfettered access to the building.

It took several months for Kehoe, 55, to
completely outfit the school building with dynamite – sticking sticks in the ceilings,
floors and in any open cracks.

In the lead up to the crime, the man’s large stock of
dynamite wasn’t seen as a red flag since as a farmer it was common to blow up
heavy stumps or large debris in fields.

But on May 18, using the timers that he had installed
throughout the building, Kehoe detonated the explosives. The explosion rocked the
building filled with children and the second floor of the building collapsed.

The explosion was heard as far away as Lansing,
according to witnesses, and at first school officials thought a boiler had exploded.

As rescuers scrambled to search for survivors, Kehoe himself
drove up to the school in a truck that was laden with dynamite and shrapnel.

His enemy, Superintendent Hyuck, approached Kehoe's vehicle,
pleading with the man to help in the rescue effort.

According to witness accounts as told to Bernstein, Kehoe told
hthe man, ‘Okay I’ll take you with me’ and he fired his gun into the cache of
dynamite in his truck, blowing himself up and killing and injuring several more. 

A day after 
the attack, police discovered that before Kehoe had launched his attack 
at the school, he killed his wife and her body was found burned 
in the remains of the Kehoe farm, which the man had torched.

Kehoe was married to Nellie but the couple had no children.

Officers also found a sign on the man's property that stated, 'Criminals
are made, not born.'

Bernstein said that Kehoe perfectly fit the clinical
description of a psychopath, making it frustrating when people begin to ask what
could have possibly motivated such a terrible crime.

'As rational beings we want a why. There is no why. That's
the frustrating, sad thing about this,' he said.

Bernstein noted the
same pattern in which Kehoe and Adam Lanza, the
20-year-old shooter in the Sandy Hook massacre, carried out the attacks.

Both killed someone 
close to
them, Kehoe killed his wife Nellie and Lanza shot his mother Nancy, then
launched a killing spree and then both took their own lives.

Hope: The Newtown community has come together in the aftermath of the tragedy

But he also noted the courage and overwhelming show of support from the community after
the terrible crimes.

Moments after the explosion at the school in 1927, a 21-year-old teacher, Hazel Weatherby, was found by rescuers
clutching two young students in her arms, according to a story told to Bernstein.

The teacher was barely breathing when
she was found and when the rescuers took the children from her arms, she succumbed to death, seemingly at peace to die knowing the children were safe. 

'It's like she instinctively reached out to protect the
children, like Vicki Soto did,’ the author said, referencing the 27-year-old
teacher at Sandy Hook who was shot as she tried to shield her young students. 

Though the Bath school disaster predated technological advances in communication,
worldwide the Michigan community still received expressions of sorrow from
across the globe.

'Out of the inexplicable bad of one person has brought out
the tremendous good of most people,' the author said, adding that he has been in touch
with many of the Bath survivors who have expressed their sorrow about the Sandy Hook tragedy.

'They’re feeling this in Bath the way no one else can. They
know what it’s like,' he said.

As the town in Connecticut tries to recover from the tragedy, the author said that the community of Bath came together to try to recover from the tragedy. 

The town tried to find a sense of normalcy and the school met in various
buildings in Bath’s downtown, the local church and the general store, while the
school building was repaired.

The building was repaired and classes resumed but in the 1970s was torn down. T

he cupola that sat on the building was preserved and now rests on a small structure at a park, on the site where the school once stood.

But as the community moved forward, many swallowed their
grief and kept their emotions to themselves.

Many only began to open up about the experience
when the author began probing in research for his book.
