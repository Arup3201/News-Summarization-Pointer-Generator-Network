It’s unlikely the majority of us are so overwhelmed with tweets, Facebook posts, emails and texts that we need someone - or something - to reply on our behalf.

However, this hasn’t stopped Google filing a patent for a system that would do just that.

According to the details of the latest patent filed by a software engineer at the firm, Google’s automated system would work like a social media bot and submit posts on a user’s behalf.

Would you let a robot send emails on your behalf? Google's latest patent describes a system that generates automated replies to online conversations. It would do this by scanning social networks, emails and texts to learn how to write in a way that mimics your language and tone

In August a patent was approved that could see Google tracking, and making money from, the eye movements of its Google Glass owners.

The Gaze Tracking System patent shows the device tracking where the wearer looks, how long they look at an item, and even how much their pupils dilate.

Information about where the user is looking could then be sent to Google's servers where an image scanning algorithm would identify what they are looking at, create a log of everything they've viewed, and potentially use this information to serve adverts.

It would do this by scanning that user’s previous posts and replies on sites such as Facebook, Google+ and LinkedIn, as well as their emails and texts messages, to learn how that person writes.

The bot would then write replies and responses to future posts in a way that mimics that person’s usual language and tone.

The more a person uses the system, the more the bot can learn the type of responses they write and this would make the suggestions sound more human and realistic.

This would also potentially involve the bot scanning posts written by friends and family too, and could have significant privacy implications.

Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother 
Watch, told MailOnline: 'Technology like this must only ever be opt-in, 
as it has the potential to allow companies like Google to harvest even 
more data from your private communications to enable automatic posting 
to sound authentic.

'If you regularly send a text message about a 
certain type of medication or email a lawyer with words like ‘divorce’ 
appearing, the computer can quite easily identify you to a human 
searching through the data looking for certain things.

Google has already been criticised for scanning the content of emails in its Gmail service for advertising purposes so it could, in theory, do the same with posts, emails and text messages.

Pickles continued: 'That sort of data is valuable to both governments and companies, so I’m
 extremely concerned about any technology that purports to offer 
convenience while in reality exposing more of our private communications
 to prying eyes.'

There are already bots capable of automating responses to emails, blog posts or comments but Google’s system would make the process more personalised.

According to the patent: ‘There is no requirement for the user to set reminders or be proactive.

‘The system automatically, without user input, analyses information to which the user has access, and generates suggestions for personalised reactions to messages.’

However, the system wouldn’t be completely automated. A user would have to approve a suggestion made by the bot before it is posted in their name.

Suggestions could also be rejected, which again would help the bot learn what kinds of posts are appropriate.
