A dog who was hours from death after surviving three weeks alone at the top of a 2,000ft peak in the Yorkshire dales has been given a home for Christmas.

The Lurcher-Saluki cross, nicknamed Wufra, was 10kg underweight and had a broken leg when a mountain rescue team found him in near-freezing temperatures.

He had to be carried a mile to safety from Buckden Pike in the Yorkshire Dales on a stretcher before he could be given emergency medical treatment.

Home: Helen Coates, 51, who works for The Dog People, took over his treatment and has now taken Wufra in

Christmas: Miss Coates said she could not bear leaving him to find a home as Christmas approached

Vets gave him just two hours to live but two months on Wufra has made a remarkable recovery and is bounding around the garden of his new owner, Helen Coates.

Miss Coates, 51, who works for The Dog People in Grassington, North Yorkshire, helped the rescue team nurse Wufra back to health - and just days before Christmas has offered him a permanent home.

She said he has received 'a mountain' of Christmas presents from well-wishers who were touched by his plight.

Miss Coates said: 'He was in such an awful way when he was first found and the thought that nobody has come forward to claim him is awful.

Rescue: He had to be carried for a mile on a stretcher down from the 2,000ft peak in the Yorkshire dales

Discovered: Upper Wharfedale Feel Rescue Associate (UWFRA) found Wufra on a mountain climb in Yorkshire

'After all he’s been through I just couldn’t put him up for rehoming.

'The day he was brought into us we were told that his organs were failing and his heart beat was half what it should have been.

'He was so skinny and I had to hold him up if he needed the toilet because he just didn’t have the strength to lift himself.

'He wasn’t responsive and it was like he was comatose.

Treatment: He was wrapped in a protective sheet to warm him up, and carried a mile down the hill

Harsh weather: The climbers hiked through treacherous conditions carrying Wufra to safety

With his broken leg, he could not have clambered down the rocky hill, and vets gave him two hours to live

'He was given just two hours to live and the vet said he probably wouldn’t make it through the first night.

'We were all amazed but he managed to pull through. It was touch and go for a few days after that but Wufra was eating really well and started to put weight on.

'He was fed every two hours on high-calorie foods and he was given antibiotics.

'When he was rescued he weighed just 13kg and now he weighs 21kg.'

Abandoned: Wufra was found with a broken leg and 10kg underweight after three weeks in the cold

Rescue team leader Andy Jackson, 44, said eight members went up and carefully carried Wufra a mile down hill to safety.

He said: 'He was so camouflaged he was probably hard to see.

'Fortunately, he was on the side that was protected from the worst of the weather and he had been there so long the grass had started to die where he had been sitting.

'When we eventually moved him, we put him into a casualty bag and onto the stretcher.

'He was happy to see us. He just had nothing in him. There was a lot of bone. He was obviously a thin dog anyway, but it looked like he hadn’t eaten.'

Mr Jackson said he thought Wufra, whose name is an anamgram of the team that saved him, Upper Wharfedale Fell Rescue Association, had previously been used for rabbiting as he had scars on his face.

Still recovering, he is supposed to be resting, but Miss Coates says he cannot resist running around.

She added: 'He’s so loving and an absolute pleasure.

'He’s incredibly lucky to be here and I think if he’d been found just a few hours later it would have been a different story.

'I’m absolutely amazed at how healthy he is now. He is due to have an x-ray on his leg next week but other than that he’s fine.

'He’s not supposed to be doing any running on it until it’s checked but try telling him that.

Healthy: After two months, he is now feeling healthier and bounds around his new owner's garden all the time

Presents: Well-wishers have sent dozens of gifts for the lurcher-Saluki cross over the festive season

Progress: He was forecast just two hours to live, but aside from a scan on his leg, Wufra has almost recovered

Vets believe he was used for rabbitting due to his condition, but he is healthy now - though still loves running

'When I let him out into the garden he runs round and round and there’s no stopping him.

'I think he’s very glad he’s alive and he obviously doesn’t realise he’s recovering from an injury.

'He’s been loving all the visitors he’s been getting too and they often find him lying flat out on the sofa with his legs in the air.

'He has a huge pile of presents all wrapped up waiting for him on Christmas Day.'
