When it came to choosing the perfect ensemble for a visit to Dents glove factory in Wiltshire, there was one accessory the Duchess of Cornwall just had to wear – a pair of Dents gloves.

Ever the diplomat, Camilla arrived at the factory, which is a short journey from Highgrove, with her hands encased in a cosy black leather pair.

She was there to see the glove-making process in action and if she couldn’t resist skating quickly past a display featuring the skins of peccary pigs used to make the gloves, it was a different story when Ruby the dog appeared.

The pet, which belongs to Dent’s chief executive, Deborah Moore, had been brought to the factory to meet the Duchess and take part in a reception for those with a long history of service.

Ruby, who has been coming to the factory each day for more than a decade, joined other long-standing members of staff and, like them, was presented with a special certificate.

Camilla, the owner of several pet dogs herself, couldn’t resist crouching down to give the dog a pat and exclaimed: ‘How very well behaved she is!’ as she did so.

Thirteen-year-old Ruby, a black Labrador, was then given a slice of a specially made doggy cake by the Duchess, which the pet swiftly wolfed down.

The moment came at the end of a visit which had also seen the Duchess tour the factory’s museum, accompanied by local staff – some of whom have been working at the factory for more than 50 years.

Given the factory’s long history of producing gloves for royalty and famous names alike, it was far from being an onerous one and, as with the Duchess herself, the accessories remain popular with the royal family – in particular, the Queen.

One of Her Majesty’s pairs, the ones she wore to the 1953 Coronation, were on display, as was another pair once owned by Queen Victoria.

Further pairs once belonged to racing driver Stirling Moss, Trafalgar victor Admiral Horatio Nelson and, oldest of all, Elizabethan explorer and courtier, Sir Walter Raleigh.

After the Duchess visited the factory, she headed over to the offices of Community First - a Wiltshire based initiative that aims to tackle disadvantage, where she was presented with a bouquet of flowers (left).

The Duchess, who was making the first of two visits in Wiltshire today, certainly appeared to enjoy it and chatted animatedly as she swept through the museum, resplendent in a navy blue dress.

Inspecting a pair of gloves dating from 1507, she expressed her amazement over the length of the fingers – a big fashion trend in the early Stuart period.

‘I can’t get over how long they are!’ she said. 

Another pair of gloves picked up by the Duchess belonged to Admiral Nelson, although in a grisly twist, they still had blood on them.

But with another engagement to attend, Camilla soon had to depart – this time bound for Devizes where a visit to Community First’s new offices awaited.

Founded in 1965, Community First is a Wiltshire based initiative that aims to tackle disadvantage and improve the quality of life for people living in the county.

Camilla's day wasn't entirely without incident, however, with the February breeze getting the better of her as she arrived at the Beacon Business Centre in Hopton Park, Devizes.

Luckily, the Duchess appears to have deployed the Queen's trick of having tiny weights added to the hem of her skirts and was spared what could have been an embarrassing moment.

Dents was founded by master craftsman John Dent in Worcester, England, in 1777.

Thanks to his meticulous workmanship and eye for creativity, Dents soon developed a reputation as a leading leather glove company. 

From the beginning, it used only the very finest English leather and perfected techniques of cut and fit which became world famous as ‘Dents’ secret fit’. 

Its gloves and accessories were soon being sought by the famous and fashionable in Paris, New York, Montreal and Sydney. 

Now sold in more than 30 different countries around the world, the gloves remain popular in every strata of society and make regular appearances on TV, most notably on ITV drama Mr Selfridge. They are also the glove of choice for Daniel Craig’s James Bond and last appeared on the silver screen during Skyfall. 

As Camilla’s visit, and the opening of the factory by Princess Anne four years ago, reveals, the gloves are almost enormously popular with the royal family. Dents also produces the coronation gloves, including those worn by George VI and Elizabeth II.
