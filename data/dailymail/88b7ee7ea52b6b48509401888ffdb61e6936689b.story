Olivia Dein, nine, has one wish this Christmas - she just wants to get better

With Christmas Day fast approaching, children across the world are eagerly waiting to see if Santa Claus received their wish lists. 

From their favourite Frozen character, to a scooter or a bike, bright parcels adorn the bottom of Christmas trees waiting to be ripped open on the big morning.

But for one nine-year-old from north London, her Christmas wish is  simple.

Olivia Dein has written asking Father Christmas to make her better.  

She was diagnosed with the life-limiting condition cystic fibrosis when she was just five weeks old.

Now she and her family face the agonising reality that half of sufferers don't live past their young years.

Her mother Sara Dein, 36, told MailOnline: 'Within 24 hours of Olivia being born we knew something was wrong.

'She failed to pass meconium as all newborns should, so she was immediately referred for tests.

'She was eventually diagnosed with cystic fibrosis at five weeks old.  

‘As a family, we knew nothing about Cystic Fibrosis. After her diagnosis, we discovered that both Olivia's dad and I are carriers of the gene. 

'Thankfully, our younger children Jessica, five, Dylan, three, don't have the condition.'

Now Olivia has written a letter to Santa Claus, outlining her wish for Christmas this year - to be well, like her brother and sister... 

Dear Santa,

'My name is Olivia and I’m nine years old. I live in London with my mum and dad and my younger brother and sister. 

'I do lots of sports and I really love netball. I’ve got a new netball post in my garden, and I enjoy playing with it.

'Lots of children ask you for toys. But, this Christmas, I wanted to write to you about something else.

'I’m different from other children. That’s because I have cystic fibrosis (CF).

'I’m so lucky to have so many toys and lovely things, but being healthier, coughing less and not having to take so many medicines would mean so much more to me this Christmas.

Instead of asking for toys this Christmas, Olivia has written to Santa Claus asking that he make her well

Cystic fibrosis is a life-limiting genetic condition. 

Only half of those diagnosed with the illness live to celebrate their 40th birthday. 

It causes the internal organs, especially the lungs and digestive system, to become clogged with thick sticky mucus, resulting in chronic infections and inflammation of the lungs.

Cystic fibrosis directly affects around 10,000 people in the UK.

The faulty gene is carried by over two million people in the UK, most of whom have no idea. 

If two carriers have children, there’s a one in four chance their child will have the condition, which slowly destroys the lungs and digestive system.

People with cystic fibrosis often look perfectly healthy. But it poses a lifelong challenge involving daily intake of drugs, time-consuming physiotherapy and isolation from others with the condition. 

It places a huge burden on those around them and the condition can critically escalate at any moment.

Olivia and her family have been supported by the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, which is in its 50th year. 

The charity aims to fundraise for better treatments and investment into cutting edge research so that people with cystic fibrosis can also look forward to their fiftieth birthdays.

‘Recently, I found out that I can die from having CF. 

'It made me feel so scared. If I could have anything this Christmas? I’d like to be well.

'Life for me is a bit like a rollercoaster – my health is up and down.

'There are so many simple things that I’d like to do that I can’t.

‘I’m not allowed to go into public indoor swimming pools.

'When I was five years old and my school friends started swimming lessons, I wasn’t allowed to join in. I was so upset.

'I’ve never swum with my friends in a public swimming pool or played in the water at school because of the infections that I could catch, and that makes me sad.

'I have to be careful around people who have coughs. If I get a cold it can damage my lungs. So if my friends or family are ill they can’t come to my house. It can be lonely sometimes.

'At the end of last term, when I was eight, I was getting more and more worried about not being able to do things. 

'I was worried that I’d never be able to go to sleepovers and parties at my friends’ houses because I’d have to do physiotherapy instead. 

'I was scared what people would think about me having to take lots of pills and not being able to join in all the activities. I felt like I was different. I felt embarrassed.

'My feelings were all mixed up. I felt angry and sad. 

'Mum and dad even bought me a punch bag to take my frustrations out on.

'I also started going to a talking doctor who helped me understand my feelings and my anger. Then, before the summer holidays, I decided that I wanted to tell more people at school about CF.  

She said: 'Recently, I found out that many CF sufferers don’t make it past their 40th birthdays. It made me feel so scared. If I could have anything this Christmas? I’d like to be well'

Olivia's mother, Sara Dein said her daughter faces strict treatment regimes that often result in her being admitted to hospital 

'I wanted to do this because it was stressing me out that they didn’t know anything about my condition. 

'My mum and dad had spoken to my teachers, but my class and other pupils didn’t really know about CF.

'So one day, my class were all sitting together and I told them what CF is and how it makes me feel. 

'I told them that I got CF because my dad has a CF gene and my mum also has a CF gene, but they didn’t both know this before I was born; when their genes made me, it gave me CF.

'I told them that you can’t catch CF; it’s something that I was born with.

'Afterwards one of my friends kept trying to help me walk, and I know she was just being nice, but I told her to stop. 

'I told people not to treat me like I’m disabled otherwise I’d get upset. I want to try to be like everyone else.

'Now that my friends know it’s a big relief. It really helps. 

'They treat me like I’m one of them, and I don’t need to use the punch bag as much. I still get upset sometimes but I’m coping better.

What I’d really like this Christmas is to be able to meet someone else who has CF – someone older who could tell me that everything was going to be ok. 

'But I’m not allowed to meet others face-to-face because we could infect each other. 

'Recently, my parents arranged for me to speak to a family friend who has CF on Skype. We tried to talk, but I felt awkward and upset and scared. I hid my face.

Though Olivia's parents both carry the CF gene they only passed it to their eldest child

'All I wanted to do was meet her in person but I can never do that. It’s horrible that we can’t meet.

‘I do physiotherapy twice a day, have lots of nebulisers and inhaled medicine and swallow at least 50 pills every day.

'I have to go to the doctors a lot. When I get really poorly with a bad chest, I have tubes in my arms - intravenous antibiotics.

'I get nightmares near my birthday because that’s when I have my yearly check up – blood tests which scare me because I hate needles.

'I’m scared about what lies ahead for me but when I grow up I want to be a vet or an actress. Since I’ve told my friends about my CF I want more people to know more too so that they can understand too. 

'And, despite everything, I still manage to have fun.

Merry Christmas

Love, Olivia

As Olivia's letter reveals, her condition affects every part of her life.  

'She has strict treatment regimens and medical routines that are lengthy and tiring,' saidher mother.

'When very poorly, she is put on intravenous medication for two weeks and potentially needs a bronchoscopy, which is an exploratory lung procedure.’ 

As Olivia has grown older and has become aware of her condition, her parents have had to address some difficult issues.

Many sufferers require life-saving heart and lung transplants if their condition deteriorates.

'We’ve used diagrams to explain the genetics to Olivia and she now understands the medical background to her condition,' said Mrs Dein.

'We talk to her about the progress that is being made with medical trials, and the hopes for medical and scientific advancements. 

'But she worries about the future and about the daily management of her condition, along with the embarrassment of explaining it to people.'

Olivia added: 'I’m scared about what lies ahead for me but when I grow up I want to be a vet or an actress. Since I’ve told my friends about my CF I want more people to know more too so that they can understand too. And, despite everything, I still manage to have fun'
