The American man brutally gored during a Spanish bull-running festival has been identified as a 20-year-old Ole Miss student on a semester abroad. 

Ben Milley, 20, from Marietta, Georgia, suffered severe injuries, including a 16-inch wound in the thigh, after he was dragged by the bull during a festival in Ciudad Rodrigo on Saturday.

He underwent surgery and was kept in intensive care but was today believed to be out of danger. 

Mr Milley is studying Spanish and economics in Salamanca. It is believed that his friends accompanied him to the hospital after he was injured and that his mother, Marilyn, was on her way to see her son in Spain.

Calls to Mr Milley's family in Georgia went unanswered on Tuesday. Mr Milley's father, Ethan, is a managing director at financial services firm JLL. 

A spokesman for the University of Mississippi told Daily Mail Online that they hadn't heard from the family so could offer no updates on the student's health. 

However Ole Miss confirmed that Mr Milley was a sophomore at the college who was currently studying abroad with a program at the Institute for the International Education of Students.

A family member, who asked to remain anonymous, told the Daily News: 'We had heard from them (Milley’s parents) what had happened, but we didn’t understand the magnitude until we saw the pictures.'

The terrifying images showed the student being tossed around by the bull before he was dragged to the side of the road by other participants and spectators. 

Mr Milley suffered injuries to his sphincter and numerous hemorrhages, according to doctors at Clinic Hospital in western Salamanca. He had a three-hour operation for injuries to his thighs, sphincter and back.  

Surgeon Enrique Crespo was called to operate on Milley after he was injured on the first day of the annual festival.

Crespo said: 'It's not the worst injury I've seen, but it's the biggest goring wound I've ever had to operate on.'

He was believed not to have to undergo any more surgeries.

Two other unidentified men were hurt during Saturday's festivities. Town councilor Pedro Munoz said: 'One man from Scotland and a Spaniard from Salamanca were also injured.'

The injured Scot is 46 years old and the wounded Spaniard is 31.  

Munoz added: 'Doctor Crespo is a world-renowned expert and we have a medically-equipped helicopter on standby every day of our annual fiesta.' 

The 20-year-old student was injured on Saturday on the first day of the event and had to have emergency surgery after going to the event with a group of friends

The festival is an annual event in Ciudad Rodrigo that celebrates the world of bullfighting, according to the Tourist Office of Spain in the U.S. 

Fiestas featuring bulls are common in Spain, and critics and aficionados alike agree that the events, which attract international audiences, are dangerous.  

Munoz said somewhere between 45,000 and 50,000 people had been attracted over the weekend to this year's four-day fiesta, that includes afternoon bullfights and bull-running events.

Ciudad Rodrigo — population 14,000 — is a small cathedral city close to the Portuguese border that is a popular tourist destination. 

It retains its ancient defensive walls and was the site of key battles between Napoleon's army and British forces under the command of the Duke of Wellington from 1810 to 1812.

The 20-year-old Ole Miss student has been recovering from his injuries in the Clinic Hospital in western Salamanca. Doctors have said he is out of trouble and is not likely to require any more surgeries

In addition to the American student two other people were hurt yesterday including a 46-year-old man from Scotland and a 31-year-old man from Salamanca
