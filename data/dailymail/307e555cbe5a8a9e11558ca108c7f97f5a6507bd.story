For many people, chatting to friends is a major reason to use Facebook’s app on their smartphone.

But soon they will have to download the social network’s partner app, called Messenger, to carry on their instant conversations.

Facebook is reportedly notifying users of its popular app that they will no longer be able to send 'chat' messages and will instead have to swap to Messenger, which was launched three years ago. It follows the company's acquisition of another popular messaging app, WhatsApp, for US$19billion.

Time for a new conversation: Facebook is notifying users of its popular app that they will soon no longer be able to send messages using it and will instead have to swap to Messenger (pictured), which was launched three years ago

People living in Europe with Android handsets and iPhones will be the first to be affected by the change, according to the company, which did not reveal a specific timeline.

‘Messenger is a much faster and better experience and we've found that people get replies 20 per cent faster on Messenger than on Facebook,’ a spokesman for the company told CNN.

‘Taking messages out of the Facebook app also lets us focus on making Messenger even better for everyone rather than working on two separate Facebook messaging experiences.’

The company halted messaging in the main app for people who have already downloaded Messenger in November, following the launch of Messenger 3.0.

Incentives to change: 'Messenger is a much faster and better experience and we've found that people get replies 20 per cent faster on Messenger than on Facebook,' a spokesman for the company said. It also has extra features like the private sending of photos (pictured left) and free calls (right)

The Messenger app works in a similar way to Facebook’s core message feature, and users will tap a ‘message’ icon within the main app to be directed to Messenger.

Facebook has indicated that it is taking renewed interest in its messaging features following the  WhatsApp takeover.

WhatsApp is particularly popular outside America and lets people send unlimited messages for US$0.99cents a year.

It has been widely reported that Facebook has no immediate plans to merge WhatsApp with Messenger. MailOnline is awaiting a response from Facebook.

Both services, as well as many more, are becoming a mainstream alternative to texting, particularly in parts of the world like Africa, India and South America where unlimited texts are not included in mobile contract bundles.

Not just for status updates? In the future you could also use Facebook to make electronic payments and stash money. The social network is rumoured to be seeking regulatory approval from the Central Bank of Ireland to become an emoney institution

In the future, Facebook's 1.2-billion users could use the network to make electronic payments and save money as well as send messages.

The social network is rumoured to be seeking regulatory approval to offer financial services - including electronic money and remittances - which would, for example, allow foreign workers to easily transfer money back to their families.

Facebook is seeking regulatory approval from the Central Bank of Ireland, which, if it is granted, would allow people to store money on the social network, transfer it to other users and pay for goods, according to a report by The Financial Times.

The Central Bank of Ireland told MailOnline 'it is not commenting on the issue at the moment', and Facebook said it does not comment on rumour or speculation.

A move into remittances would help Facebook gain an even stronger foothold in emerging markets including India and Africa.

While Facebook has not commented on the rumours a source, said to be familiar with the details, told The FT: ‘Facebook wants to become a utility in the developing world and remittances are a gateway drug to financial inclusion.’

If those in developing nations flock to Facebook, the company would boost its advertising revenues, and e-money services could become a big attraction - it would be particularly useful to users in areas without easy access to banks.

Elizabeth Cobbett, lecturer in International Political Economy at the University of East Anglia (UEA), told MailOnline: 'The materiality of banking and finance is changing rapidly and this change is most visible in emerging markets where they do not have the infrastructure in place. So it is a clean slate for new technology.

'This is clearly evident in Africa. Facebook wants in on the game and the huge potential market.'She explained that there are two-and-a-half billion 'unbanked' adults across the globe and so the potential market is huge.
