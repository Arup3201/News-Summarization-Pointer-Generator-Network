Arsenal have revived their interest in Spartak Moscow midfielder Romulo.

Manager Arsene Wenger considered a move for the 24-year-old Brazilian last January and the player’s agents have made contact with the Gunners in the hope of pushing through a deal next month.

Romulo, who has been likened in style to Gilberto Silva, was in Brazil’s 2012 Olympic squad and is a favourite of national coach Dunga.

Brazilian sides Flamengo and Internacional are keen to sign Romulo on loan but he wants a permanent move to Arsenal if terms can be thrashed out.

Spartak want £8million plus Yaya Sanogo on loan but the French striker is not keen on a move to Moscow.

Wenger does have an interest in Everton's James McCarthy but the Goodison Park club's valuation makes that a difficult transfer to pull off.

Meanwhile, Arsenal are understood to have offered £1.6m for Legia Warsaw's 16-year-old defensive midfielder Krystian Bielik.

Legia are willing to accept the offer and Bielik and his parents have been invited to watch Arsenal play QPR on Boxing Day in the hope of persuading the youngster to make the move to London. He will be offered a three-year contract.
