Lord Justice Leveson ignored direct police evidence of how blue-chip companies fuelled the illegal trade in personal information.

A senior officer submitted documents outlining how a little-known three-year inquiry uncovered a nationwide network of corruption. The multi-million-pound investigation found law firms, debt collectors and insurers were behind the thriving underground trade.

But despite holding eight months of gruelling public hearings at a huge cost to the taxpayer, Leveson dismissed the officer’s evidence in less than 18 minutes.

The revelation renews pressure on the High Court judge to explain why he ignored evidence of hacking and other illegal activities outside of the media. He is already under fire for refusing to consider an incendiary intelligence dossier compiled by the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca). It included a list of 102 companies and individuals linked to a group of rogue private eyes who blagged, hacked and stole sensitive data.

Earlier this week Soca chairman Sir Ian Andrews resigned after failing to declare a conflict of interests as the row over the list rumbled on. The move raised hopes that members of the home affairs committee will find a solution to the deadlock created by his refusal to allow its publication.Last night, Labour shadow home secretary Stella Creasy said there was a growing sense of confusion and Soca’s ‘silence’ cannot continue.

She said the crime-fighting agency had lost people’s confidence and there were ‘legitimate questions’ over whether disclosing the names would be in the public interest.

She added: ‘We urgently need Soca to give clear answers to legitimate questions about its confidential list.’

Evidence about the three-year inquiry was given by Russell Middleton, who was then an acting assistant chief constable for Devon and Cornwall Police.

In papers submitted to the Leveson Inquiry, he revealed how he and others uncovered evidence of a network of corrupt public officials. Police officers, support staff, prison guards and benefits agency staff were all suspected of leaking confidential information to private detectives.

They in turn were supplying corporate clients who were hungry for sensitive data that could not be obtained elsewhere.

The inquiry, known as Operation Reproof, began after a member of public uncovered a building contractor’s criminal record during a planning dispute.

Police suspected the information was obtained illegally and quickly discovered an illicit network handling private data.

They found that the personal details of Gordon Brown, at that time Chancellor, were checked on the Police National Computer.

Devon and Cornwall alerted five other forces, including the Met, as organisations including the prison service, benefits agency, BT and mobile phone companies were targeted.

The inquiry led to six men – two serving police officers, two retired officers, and two private detectives – being charged. But the sprawling case was thrown out of court in 2005 by a judge who said it had no hope of securing any convictions.

In a remarkable comment, the Exeter judge said he did not consider a PC passing private information to a former  colleague as ‘a serious matter that amounted to misconduct’.

Mr Middleton said that his inquiry nevertheless uncovered shocking evidence of how the illegal information trade went far wider than the media.

He told Leveson he ‘never found any direct evidence or indirect evidence linking that information being requested by or for any part of the media or journalists’. Instead the clients were ‘national companies, insurance companies’ who were instructing investigations into civil claims, accidents and marriage disputes.

The senior officer’s evidence adds weight to criticism of Leveson for focusing too narrowly on the media.

Tory MP Nicola Blackwood, a member of the home affairs committee, has previously suggested that Leveson could have adopted a broader remit.

Speaking last month about  evidence contained in the suppressed Soca report, Miss Blackwood said it could have changed the course of the inquiry. She said: ‘I cannot understand why they did not make these points to the Home Office when the Leveson Inquiry terms of reference were being set in the first place.’

A Leveson Inquiry spokesman said: ‘The terms of reference for the inquiry related to the culture, practices and ethics of the press and how they engaged with the public, the police and politicians. Evidence on other issues was outside those terms of reference.’
