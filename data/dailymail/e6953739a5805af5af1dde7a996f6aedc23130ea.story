Everton’s poor run is the biggest threat to the tranquility that Roberto Martinez has created in his 18 months at Goodison Park.

Everton players are used to Martinez using the carrot rather than the stick, especially with key players like Romelu Lukaku.

But the Merseysiders go to Newcastle on Sunday in 12th place, having won just one of their last seven games.

Yet keeper Tim Howard, who injured his calf against Stoke on Boxing Day, says the manager remains calm.

‘I’d be banging my head against the wall throwing things, and he just has this calm demeanour about him,’ said Howard, whose club could face action from the FA after a fan appeared to shine a laser towards the eyes of Stoke’s Bojan Krkic.
