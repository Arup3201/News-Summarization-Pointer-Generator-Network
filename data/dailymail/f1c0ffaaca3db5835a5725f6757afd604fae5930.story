Prince Charles spoke of his love of home-grown veg after sharing a joke about a brightly-coloured squash at a food festival today.

The Prince and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, visited the Edible Garden Show at Alexandra Palace to speak about healthy diets with local schoolchildren.

As they toured stalls at the event in north London, the royal couple were seen laughing with TV chef Raymond Blanc after being presented with the yellow vegetable.

The show is aimed at encouraging people to grow their own produce and promotes organic fruit and veg.

Charles, 65, spoke to local school children after arriving at the event, telling them Brussels sprouts taste better as you grow older.

After meeting the Prince, 10-year-old Noah Gordon told the Tottenham and Wood Green Journal: 'I can’t believe I was so close to him.

'He’s a very nice man. He likes talking to people. He’s really friendly.'

Schoolmate Laura Solomon, 11, added: 'It’s hard not to boast when you’ve seen someone so amazing.'

Well-wishers later presented the couple with a miniature wheelbarrow for their grandson, Prince George, the paper reported.

Restauranteur Raymond Blanc later told his Twitter followers of his joy at meeting the Prince and Duchess

Raymond Blanc, 64, was at the event promoting his work with organic growing charity, Garden Organic.

He also told visitors to the show about the garden at his Belmond Le Manoir aux Quat’Saisons, his two Michelin star Restaurant and Hotel in Great Milton, Oxfordshire.

In April last year, the restaurateur launched the National Heritage Garden Competition for gardeners to enter their designs.

He spoke to Charles and Camilla, 66, at Garden Organic's stall before posting a picture of himself with the Prince on his Twitter feed.

Charles runs the 'Mygrove' competition, which gives children the chance to win a visit to his sustainably-run garden at Highgrove.

The Edible Garden Show is staged over three days from March 28-30, with guests including botanist and TV presenter James Wong and the BBC’s One Show and gardening guru Christine Walkden.

BBC Radio 4’s Gardeners’ Question Time programme was also recorded at Alexandra Palace today to coincide with the Royal visit.

Charles' trip to the food festival comes days after he was presented with a freshly-baked pretzel while touring the streets of Ham in Surrey.

After delicatessen worker Petra Braun told him he would enjoy the snack because of his German roots, he replied: 'Well, that was a long time ago.'
