A teenage tennis star has revealed how being ‘fat shamed’ two years ago by the U.S. Tennis Association (USTA) has helped her develop the mental toughness to succeed.

Taylor Townsend, 18, become the youngest American to reach the third round at the French Open in over a decade when she beat 21st-ranked Alize Cornet 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 on Wednesday.

Currently ranked 205th, Townsend may still carry a few extra pounds for a rising tennis player, but says she used the very public criticism as motivation to improve her game.

‘It helped me believe in myself more,’ she told CBS Chicago. ‘It also opened my eyes to say, “You know, you're not going to look like everyone else.”’

The Chicago native was the reigning number one junior tennis player in the world in 2012, when the  USTA said they wouldn't finance any other tournament appearances until she lost weight and got into better shape. 

'Our concern is her long-term health, number one, and her long-term development as a player,' Patrick McEnroe, general manager of the USTA's player development program, told the Wall Street Journal at the time.

Townsend went to the tournament anyway - her mom paid their travel expenses - and she won the junior doubles title and advanced to the quarterfinals in the singles division.

Townsend exited the French Open on Friday after losing to Spain's Carla Suarez Navarro, but the teenager is predicted to have a big future in the sport

After the USTA controversy, Townsend stopped working with coaches from the association and started training with former Wimbledon runner-up Zina Garrison in Washington.

'I started working really hard trying to get in the best shape that I could be for my body,' Townsend said. 'It actually turned out to be a huge strength for me.'

Following the 2012 incident, Townsend received support from Serena Williams, another tennis star to have received flack over her less than svelte figure.

'For a female, particularly, in the United States, in particular, and African-American, to have to deal with that is unnecessary,' said Williams.

'Women athletes come in all different sizes and shapes and colors and everything. I think you can see that more than anywhere on the tennis tour.'

In 2007, Williams won the Australian Open singles title despite being in what has been described as 'the worst shape of her career'

Former U.S. tennis star Lindsay Davenport also ranked among the largest players on the women's tour - standing at 6-foot-2 and weighing 175lbs - and still became number one.

Former number one on the men's side, Mats Wilander said: 'You have to be fit underneath, I don't think you necessarily have to look ripped.'

The USTA later reimbursed Townsend's mother for their travel costs to the 2012 U.S. Open, and Townsend and the organization have since reconciled.
