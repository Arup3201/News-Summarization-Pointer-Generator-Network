Leah Beth Richards has died after a 11 year battle with cancer after deciding to stop treatment

When the pain became too much, Leah-Beth Richards made the bravest choice of her short life.

Faced with yet more debilitating radiotherapy for a rare cancer, the then eight-year-old asked her mummy to stop the treatment because ‘it was hurting’.

Her plea left her family facing a legal battle with medical staff who wanted her to continue going to hospital.

But it also illustrated Leah-Beth’s determination to live life to the full.

Displaying maturity beyond her tender years, the courageous schoolgirl became an inspiration to all with her positive attitude as she tried to make the most of every precious day.

There was even a period of remission, and she was introduced to her Chelsea football club heroes Frank Lampard and John Terry.

Earlier, she had touched the hearts of actress Catherine Zeta-Jones and husband Michael Douglas, who visited while she was being treated at the Children’s Hospital for Wales.

Leah-Beth battled on for five years. But earlier this year, parents Kathryn and Mark, who had been told there was no hope of curing the cancer, were informed it had returned and there was little hope.

Last week, Leah-Beth died aged 13 at the family home in Pontypridd, South Wales. Her funeral was held on Monday and she was taken to the crematorium in a pink coffin on a horse-drawn hearse.

Leah-Beth was just two when she was diagnosed with a Wilms tumour, a kidney cancer which affects around 70 children a year in the UK. She asked for the treatment to end when she was eight and had a 5lb tumour in her stomach.

Leah-Beth said at the time: ‘Sometimes I don’t feel like going into hospital ... I’m frightened that they’re going to keep me in.

‘I was upset about the radiotherapy and I asked Mummy to stop it, to stop taking me there because it was hurting.

‘I would rather stay at home than keep going back there.’

Mother-of-four Mrs Richards, 41, said at the time: ‘We would rather she had some special months than painful years.

‘She can’t even walk downstairs without getting out of breath - what kind of life is that?

‘We are thinking of her quality of life not quantity.’

However, the couple faced a battle with doctors who threatened to take legal action to make Leah-Beth carry on with her radiotherapy.

Mrs Richards continued: ‘I was shocked when the doctors told us we had no choice. They said that was why they had child protection services.’

Health chiefs ruled they had a responsibility to Leah-Beth because she was so young.

However, the dispute never reached court and Leah-Beth is understood to have received some further treatment.

At her funeral, a family friend told the 200 mourners: ‘Leah-Beth was a very strong and positive lady whose life was turned upside down by illness.

‘She was an old head on young shoulders with a wicked sense of humour. She had no fear and lived to the full – she was loved by all who knew her. Mark and Kathryn could not have had a more wonderful daughter.

‘Leah-Beth made her parents the proudest on earth. She had an infectious personality and touched everyone she met.’

Mourners carried out the family’s wish to wear something bright to the service and the pallbearers all wore pink.

A family spokesman said: ‘We are devastated. Kathryn can’t find the words to say how painful it is to lose her.'
