 

Dave Molter, 84, collapsed while trying to give his ailing wife Corrine, 83, CPR, police have said

An 84-year-old man collapsed and died while giving his ailing wife CPR, police said.

Dave and Corrine Molter, who had been together for more than 60 years, were found dead in their home on Lake Wylie, South Carolina on Monday.

Their carer, Brandy Williams, found the couple after kicking open the door when no one answered.

It is believed that Mrs Molter, 83, was in the advance stages of Alzheimer's, and that her husband had become her constant companion.

Ms Williams, who had visited Mr and Mrs Molter three days a week since May, said the couple shared 'the kind of love you see in the movies.'

She told WSOC: ' [They were] just wonderful people. I've never met anybody like that in my life. 

'They had the kind of love you see in the movies, not the kind you see in real life.' 

The couple have a daughter who lives in Hawaii, a son in North Carolina - and siblings in Florida and Maryland.

Neighbours said that Mrs Molter had been known to wander from her home and that Mr Molter had taken to following her on walks to make sure she didn't fall into the lake near their home.

The couple lived in a house, believed to be one of the oldest in the neighbourhood, that Mr Molter had built himself.  

Mr Molter was a member of the Steele Creek Masonic Lodge. Friends there said that he brought his wife to meetings because he couldn't leave her.

Mr Molter  worked on the health and happiness committee, which kept track of births, illnesses, deaths, and any kind of important events in the lives of lodge members.

Wray Moxley, a fellow Masonic Lodge member, told WSOC that it was 'fitting' that they died together.

He said: 'He really loved her. We all knew if something ever happened, he'd take care of her.'  

York County Coroner Sabrina Gast said that no autopsies are planned because there was nothing suspicious at the house, and no foul play is suspected.

Mr and Mrs Molter's carer Brandy Williams said that the couple, pictured, had the 'kind of love you only see in movies'. They were found in their home on Lake Wylie, South Carolina, by Ms Williams on Monday
