This is the moment romantic Phil Johnson proposed to girlfriend Tracy Laban during a visit to an aquarium - with a diamond ring he had hidden inside an oyster shell.

Phil, a police officer, had arranged with staff at the SeaLife Centre in Weymouth, Dorset, to pop the question to Tracy, who was also celebrating her 38th birthday.

When a worker gave her the oyster shell as a birthday gift, Tracy opened it and was shell-shocked to find a sparkly ring in it.

She turned to Phil, 31, to find him on one knee and proposing marriage.

Phil chose the SeaLife centre as that is where the couple had their first date when they met 18 months ago.

Tracy, a vet from Bovey, Devon, said: 'When I was handed the oyster I was surprised and thought I might have to swallow it raw or something.

'But I noticed there was a tag and I opened it up, saw this gleaming ring and turned around and Phil was on the floor, it wasn't until the last minute that I realised what was happening.

Tracey sent Phil a friend request on Facebook after he popped up as a suggested friend

'He had spoken about getting married before but I hadn't thought anymore about it'

'He had spoken about getting married before but I hadn't thought anymore about it. It was really good.'

The couple began talking on Facebook when Tracey sent Phil a friend request in June 2011, and met up four weeks later.

Phil, a police constable for the Metropolitan Police, had been planning the proposal for six months.

He said: 'I thought the SeaLife Centre would be an ideal location to propose.

'I was really nervous all day and when she opened the oyster shell I said, 'I love you very much, will you marry me.'

'It felt like a lifetime before she said yes, even though it was only about five seconds, and looked very surprised and shocked.

'It was an amazing experience and the best day of my life so far.'

The turtles at the SeaLife Centre where Phil proposed are also feeling the love
