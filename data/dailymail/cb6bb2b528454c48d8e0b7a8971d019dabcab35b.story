A forest floor that behaves like a bouncy trampoline has left scientists baffled.

The phenomenon, which is thought to be natural, enables people to bounce upon a patch of earth, but scientists are struggling to explain why the ground is behaving as it is.

A pair of hikers came across the unusual spot close to a river in a forest in St Jerome, Quebec in Canada.

In a video, one of the men bounces on the earth like it is a trampoline, leading people to question whether the video is a hoax.

However, it is thought the phenomenon is natural.

The creator of the video told io9 the vegetation around the site is still alive and the earth strong enough to hold ‘many people'.

Some experts believe the cause of the springy ground is a build-up of roots, while others think it could be a dense patch of peat moss.

An expert from Kew Gardens told MailOnline: 'I have 
heard that some forestry workers falling from trees in temperate old 
growth forests have survived thanks to the deep layer of organic matter 
made of part decomposed leaves, fungal mycelium, other fibrous debris, 
which can absorb the impact of their fall.'

Scientists are unsure exactly why the patch of earth in Canada is so springy.

Theories include:

Emeritus Professor Andrew Schofield, from the University of Cambridge’s Geotechnical and Environmental Research
 Group, told MailOnline that the bouncy ground could possibly be 
explained by ‘a couple of fallen young trees spanning an hollow, and 
branches and leaves on top making a platform.

‘It could be not a patch of ground at all - it could be natural and not a deliberate hoax.’

‘If I was out for a walk and came across it I would let my grandchildren see me happy on nature’s trampoline,’ he added.

'I can be pretty certain that that is the most likely reason for the wave effect on the video.'

Another
 possibility to explain the phenomenon is soil liquefaction, where the 
ground sucks up a large quantity of water and becomes like an incredible
 vicious liquid as it is so waterlogged.

But
 some experts think the conditions do not look like liquefaction, which 
usually appears like a patch of earth without foliage.
