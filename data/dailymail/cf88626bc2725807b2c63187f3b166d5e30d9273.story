For singletons fed up with their family and friends asking whether they have met ‘that special someone,’ there are two new apps that could help them fake a relationship.

The Invisible Girlfriend and Invisible Boyfriend apps will send convincing text messages and even voicemails from a virtual partner as 'proof' of a relationship.

It was created so that single people under pressure to find a partner, but who don’t want to date, can practice flirting, or simply use the service to keep well-meaning relatives off their back.

The Invisible Boyfriend and Invisible Girlfriend apps (pictured) allow single people to create a partner and their personality, to make it look like they are dating. 'Proof' will be provided in the form of text messages, enabling users to interact with their virtual partner

The St Louis-based company says on its website: ‘Invisible Boyfriend gives you real-world and social proof that you’re in a relationship - even if you’re not - so you can get back to living life on your own terms.’

Currently available as a private beta version in the US and Canada, users will be able to download a gender-specific app and start receiving messages from a fictional partner, for around $25 a month. 

The monthly subscription will include 100 text messages (examples shown), 10 voicemails and even a handwritten letter

To begin with, they will choose a boyfriend or girlfriend from an ‘extensive library’ before customising the avatar's personality and deciding how they would like to interact.

They will be able to share photos and tell a believable back story to their friends about how they met, which can be concocted on the app, choosing from scenarios such as a bar, holiday or even climbing.

The monthly subscription will include 100 text messages, 10 voicemails and even a handwritten letter, co-founder Kyle Tabor told Betabeat, although the company says is planning different packages. 

The idea is that single users can show the plausible messages to friends and family in order to dodge awkward social situations, such as being set up with relatives’ unsuitable acquaintances.

‘Put simply, this platform helps you create credible, reasonable stories that you can bring home to curious mum, your buddies, and co-workers. These stories are backed by virtual and real-world social proof,’ the firm says.

Mr Tabor told MailOnline that the texts will be a mixture of automated messages and those written by humans. 

While ‘proof’ may one day extend to gifts and flowers send by the company and paid for by the user, it has ruled out offering sexts or naked pictures of virtual partners.

The apps came about because co-founder Matt Hoffmann was newly divorced and tired of feeling pressurised to date. 

‘Around Thanksgiving, my mum called me and asked if she should set an extra place for someone I’m bringing,’ he explained in a blog post.  

Users will be able to share photos and tell a believable back story to their friends about they and their 'partner' met, which can be concocted on the app, choosing from scenarios such as a bar, holiday or even climbing, as pictured

Prospective users in the US and Canada have to apply to join the private beta, which is launching soon.

‘If accepted, you will receive access to create an account, build a boyfriend, and use all of the services for a small one-time fee,’ the website says.

When the app is widely released, users will choose a suitable package and select a boyfriend or girlfriend from a library, then customise his or her personality to their taste and decide how to interact.

The main feature of the service is being able to exchange text messages with a virtual girlfriend or boyfriend.

They will be able to do this via a dashboard, which they will also be able to use to create personalised stories about how they met.

Over time, the company will add voicemails and phone calls.

There is also a possibility that the service may also extend to virtual partners sending gifts and flowers – paid for by the user – to enhance the deception, but the company has ruled out offering sexts or naked photos.

‘In that moment I realised how great it would be to have an answer for her that didn’t require me to actually be dating someone.’

The idea of virtual partners won a start-up competition, which encouraged the duo to build the apps.

Since then, they have worked out a way of making the text messages sound real so that users can text their invisible partner and receive a prompt reply. 

In the future, the company is working on a way to give virtual partners a face.

‘In essence, your boyfriend will be someone you’re not ashamed to bring home to mum, a homebody bridging the gap between Plain Jane and a wildcard. Our boyfriends are credible proof who are obtainable and believable,’the company said.

The founders think their apps meet a universal problem of society putting pressure on single people to be in a relationship and can be used when someone starts dating too.

‘We’re excited about the ways Invisible Girlfriend and Boyfriend are helping people navigate the dating scene. 

The service creates a safe space for you to practice texting with a real human if you’re out of practice.

‘Sometimes it even inspires just enough jealousy to jolt that special person into committing,’ they said.
