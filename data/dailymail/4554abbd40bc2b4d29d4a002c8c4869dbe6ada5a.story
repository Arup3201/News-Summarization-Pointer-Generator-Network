An American man accused of sexually abusing Kenyan children and circulating the images on the internet will now die behind bars after being sentenced to 50 years in jail. 

Terry Ray Krieger, 59, was arrested in October after Interpol tipped off Kenyan police about an internet user in the country who went by the alias 'Babytoddler123' and was making and distributing pedophile material for overseas users.

His arrest came after Interpol investigations in Germany and the United States.

Krieger, from the state of Michigan, had initially denied the charges but then changed his plea to guilty last month.

His victims are aged between three and 10 and are from the area where Krieger lives in Olepolos in Ngong, Kajiado County, according to Daily Nation.

'Children occupy a special place in society and their rights must be protected,' Nairobi Magistrate Joseph Karanja told the court.

'The accused has robbed young children of their innocence and it is disturbing that these despicable acts have been going on undetected,' he said, dismissing the wheelchair-bound Krieger's contention that he was a paraplegic and should be shown some leniency.

Krieger allegedly exchanged 36 files between December 7, 2013 and May 18, 2014.

He would use online media platforms GigaTribe, Yahoo Chat and Skype to send the images.

Krieger was also identified as a repeat offender, having been convicted in 1992 in the United States for criminal sexual conduct with an under 13, for which he served three years in prison.

He was released in 1995. 

The minimum sentence under Kenyan law is six years, but the judge ruled Krieger should face a maximum possible term of 50 years - meaning he will likely die behind bars.
