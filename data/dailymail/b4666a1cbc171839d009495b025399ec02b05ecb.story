The inquest into the death of poisoned spy Alexander Litvinenko could be scrapped and replaced with a public inquiry to allow evidence to be heard in secret.

Coroner Sir Robert Owen ruled today that he cannot hear evidence on whether Mr Litvinenko's death could have been prevented, or any alleged links to the involvement of the Russian state, in public.

Mr Litvinenko's widow Marina described the decision as a 'frightening precedent' and 'a tragedy for British justice.'

Justice: The family of Alexander Litvinenko want his inquest to be held in public but a coroner has upheld an appeal by the UK Foreign Office for parts to be heard behind closed doors

Mr Litvinenko, 43, was poisoned with 
radioactive polonium-210 while drinking tea at the Millennium Hotel in 
London's Grosvenor Square in 2006.

His family believes he was working for MI6 at the time and was killed on the orders of the Kremlin.

Under fire: Foreign Secretary William Hague has been accused by Mr Litvinenko's family of putting trade with Russia before exposing the truth about his death

The coroner's ruling was published today after he accepted an application by the UK Foreign Office to keep certain information under wraps.

Evidence cannot be heard in secret as part of an inquest, but could be as part of a public inquiry.

Sir Robert said: 'It is my present view that I should hear submissions as to whether I should invite the Secretary of State (the Home Secretary) on behalf of Government to consider whether the power to hold an inquiry should be exercised in this case.'

He said that the issues of preventability and Russian involvement are of 'central importance' to the investigation into Mr Litvinenko's death.

Addressing the first issue, he said his duty to carry out 'a full, fair and fearless investigation' would be hampered if it was not included.

He also said that excluding key evidence on the issue of Russian involvement would cause him 'grave concern'.

The coroner went on: 'Were an inquiry to be held into the circumstances of Mr Litvinenko's death, the relevant material could be taken into account.'

A statement from Mrs Litvinenko's solicitors said: 'This is a very sad day for Mrs Litvinenko, a tragedy for British justice which has until now been respected around the world, and it is frightening precedent for all of those, around the world, who have been trying so hard to expose the crimes committed by conspiracy of organised that operate from the Kremlin.'

It added: 'Mrs Litvinenko is utterly dismayed by the Coroner's decision to abandon his search for the truth about Russian state responsibility for her husband's death.

'The effect of today's ruling is to protect those responsible for ordering the murder of a British citizen on the streets of London, and to allow the Russian government to shield behind a claim for secrecy made by William Hague with the backing of the Prime Minister David Cameron.'

'All those concerned with exposing the truth will be shocked and saddened that a political deal has been done between the two governments to prevent the truth from ever seeing the light of day.'

The statement from Mrs Litvinenko's solicitors said they would now be pressing the coroner to order a full public inquiry as a matter of urgency as this is 'the only way now that the truth can be exposed' despite meaning secret evidence will be considered in a closed session.

Alex Goldfarb, a friend of the 
Litvinenko family and his widow Marina, said the decision was 'deeply 
dismaying', and that it was 'upsetting' that in his view British 
government had prioritised its political relationship with Russia over 
the need to hold an open inquest.

He
said: 'It appears the British government is more concerned about the 
use of chemical weapons in Syria than radioactive weapons being used on 
the streets of London.'

However Mr Goldfarb added: 'On the other
hand, it's an admission by the British government that the Russian 
state is culpable because otherwise they would not have requested 
immunity. That in itself is a partial victory for Marina.'
