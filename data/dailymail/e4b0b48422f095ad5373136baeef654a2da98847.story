He's the whiz-kid who famously came up with one of the world's most popular Apps while 'bored at school', and who is now weighing up investment offers of up to half a million dollars for his next big idea.

On the back of that bit of inspiration last year in science class and a just ended fact-finding mission to the United States, Ben Pasternak, 15, is in line for a gilt-edged and much sought after internship at the likes of Facebook and Google.

But finding a seat alongside the tech-heads in Silicon Valley is just the tip of the iceberg for young Ben, as he revealed to Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday. He's had discussions with venture capitalists in San Francisco keen to bankroll his new venture to the tune of 'well, if I got to keep the money I could buy two new Ferraris'.

He's the Aussie whiz-kid who famously came up with one of the world's most popular Apps while 'bored at school'. Ben Pasternak has just come back from visiting the biggest social media hubs in the US and is now weighing up investment offers of up to half a million dollars for his next big idea

Ben Pasternak tells how he had discussions with venture capitalists in San Francisco keen to bankroll his new venture to the tune of 'well, if I got to keep the money I could buy two new Ferraris'

Thumbs up. The 15-year-old has been wowed by visits to the likes of Facebook and is very keen on cracking it for a much sought-after internship at the social networking hub's office 

As to what his latest brainwave might be, it was met with the classic line, 'can't say much but what I can say' response.

'Basically I am trying to make instant messaging more personal and in the moment,' he added.

'My new year's resolution was to make last year look like a warm-up.'

And with some estimates that the first App he developed is nudging 800,000 downloads, that's saying something.

'Sure I would be interested at interning at Facebook but I don't plan to work for them, I want to start my own. I haven't got much to say on that but I am looking to start my own thing.'

The success of Impossible Rush, which he enlisted the help of his mate Austin in Chicago for and then sold the rights to it for just $200, created this huge wave of interest he is riding. His recent American sojourn landed him in the offices of Facebook, Apple, Instagram and Google - so busy was he, that he didn't get to take up an invitation from Yahoo.

This magnificent obsession all began with a fascination, at age eight, for the on-line Disney game, Club Penguin.

Ben Pasternak (far right) was in rare company at the 'Hackathon', just one of 20 students from outside the United States to be invited to attend the event which attracted 450 of the brightest tech minds and challenged them to come up with an exciting product within just 36 hours

Like many others, Mark Zuckerberg is someone the Aussie schoolboy looks up to and said just walking past his office to see him locked in top-level meetings was 'surreal'

Now the Year 10 Reddam House School (Woollahra) student is meeting with like-minded teens at what he insists is he next big thing - Hackathons.

'It's (a competition) where you get teams of 2 to 5 people and all teams have 36 hours to make a hardware product, website or a new app,' he said.

'There are several judges usually presidents of large companies like Facebook and Google.

'They are fun and they are really changing everything we thought about tech, we can make great products in a short amount of time.'

He was just one of 20 invited from outside of the United States to take part, with more than 400 other budding entrepreneurs. 

'We (his team) made an App that warns Californian residents up to 60 seconds before an earthquake strikes.'

'Sure I would be interested at interning at Facebook but I don't plan to work for them, I want to start my own. I haven't got much to say on that but I am looking to start my own thing'

'Silicon Valley is where it is at' says the Sydney schoolboy. The 15-year-old who developed one of the world's leading Apps while in science class wants to move the United States to further his tech career

At 15, time is on his side but Ben is a young man in a hurry. That means his expertise could be lost to this country.

'100 per cent, I definitely think there's not anyone out there who is my age in Australia who has the same ambitions as me, and I don't look at what is happening here in Australia too much because I would probably know already if there was something that interested me,' he said.

'I can't blame Australia because Silicon Valley is where it is at, I am definitely looking to move, maybe even if in the next few months.'

He exudes confidence but that doesn't mean he doesn't stand in awe of his peers - namely Facebook co-founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg.

'I walked past his office and he's just sitting there, it was pretty surreal, every time I saw him he was in meetings,' he said.

'I look up to him, for sure, he started really little and now it's the biggest social media in the world and changed the world.

'I went to Facebook twice.'

'My dad and younger brother came with me (to the US) and my family always knew I was interested in this thing and at some point it would kick off'

His family is not shocked at his grand plans to relocate.

'My dad and younger brother came with me (to the US) and my family always knew I was interested in this thing and at some point it would kick off,' he said.

'When I told them I was making apps and stuff, I told them "trust me I am going to get to the top of the charts" and after the game went viral they began to understand.'

With the popularity, however, come the challenges.

'Social media is some good parts and some bad parts,' Ben said.

'It connects everyone and is easier to spread a message.

'But I am getting all this attention, about 200 Facebook friend requests a day, most I don't know, so I check them against mutual friends.'

Fame and maybe a fortune to follow for Ben Pasternak. 'I am getting all this attention, about 200 Facebook friend requests a day, most I don't know'
