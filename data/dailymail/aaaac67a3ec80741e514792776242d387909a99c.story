When the Eswein-Phillips family of social media moguls sit down to dinner, or go for a walk together, they don't just have each other to please.

The so-called 'First Family' of the Instagram photo-sharing network have around a million and a half eager audience members to keep happy with their familial comings and goings.

Their band of followers religiously shows their appreciation for the mixture of picture-perfect meals, idyllic cityscapes and luxury living served up on a daily basis by Sarah Phillips and her children Liz and Tom.

The first family of Instagram pose in the living room of their Upper East Side, New York apartment with dogs Coco and Duke. From left to right Tom Eswein, Sarah Phillips, Reed Phillips and Liz Eswein. The family document their day to day lives on social media and have gained around 1.6million followers.

Each member of the family - with one notable exception - has staked out territory on Instagram, which recently overtook Twitter to be the most active social network.

Sarah Phillips, 61, the matriarch of the family, and has claimed the enviable account handles @food and @baking, with followings of 330,000 and 27,500 respectively.

Liz, 25, took on @newyorkcity, which has attracted a 1.1million-strong audience with its stream of idyllic-looking skyscrapers, coffee shops and tourist spots, edited to perfection.

Meanwhile Tom Eswein, 29, who used to help out with @food, has turned his experience as a construction project manager to bear on his online life. He runs the @realestate tagline, which has a nascent following of 4,000.

Team work: In the above post of the Rockefeller Plaza at Christmas, Liz plugs her brothers @realestate account, netting him hundreds of new followers

All-American: This apple pie was 'liked' by 520 of the accounts 27,500 followers

In an interview with the New York Times, the family revealed that they have an in-house rule of waiting for the night's food to be photographed before they sit down for dinner.

And once the eating begins, the generations trade social media strategy between courses.

Sarah said that she imposes a strict two-per-day limit on posts from her food accounts, and often sits down with her daughter to help choose which photographs will do best online.

The children have also shown a business aptitude for the social network - Tom arranged marketing deals to go with his mom's food posts, while Liz now works as a social media agent, representing other prominent posters.

Her own New York-centric account also features a number of brands prominently, including NYC-based jewelers Tiffany and the Pantene beauty brand.  

Ingenious: Creations like these apple-shaped fruit pies have earned the matriarch a hefty following

Melting: This manchego, tomato, olive, garlic and ham tapas selection was liked 7,700 times

Cheers: Liz's posts show off an idealized version of New York City, featuring landmarks like the Empire State Building, and turning brand associations (such as the one above with Tiffany jewelers) to good use

House rules: Culinary creations such as the above must be mined for social media success before the family sits down to eat

A less enthusiastic participant in the Eswein-Phillips social media ascendancy is Reed Phillips, the Eswein children's stepfather and an investment banker.

Though he has an Instagram account, he rarely posts and referred to the network as 'their thing'.

But for the rest, their family connection helps them push their message even further.

Liz, who has Tom as one of her Instagram clients, recently ran a  Christmas-themed post from the @newyorkcity account, directing followers to @realestate, resulting in a hefty boost for her brother's audience.

Even the family dogs, Duke and Coco, have their own account, and get the occasional mention in posts, bringing the ring of real life to the heavily-edited online world.
