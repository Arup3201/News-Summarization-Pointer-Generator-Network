For once, it was not the humiliating revelations of drug taking or bad behaviour which left disgraced Toronto Mayor Rob Ford red faced - it was his vigorous dancing.

The beleaguered politician was more than happy to risk what shred of dignity he had left by performing an embarrassing dance routine during Christmas festivities in the city's council chamber today.

Chubby Mayor Ford worked up quite a 
sweat with his hand waving and gyrating to Bob Marley's One Love, which 
was greeted with amusement by most of his colleagues.

Working up a sweat: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford breaks into an energetic dance in the council chamber

Festive: The disgraced mayor joined in with Christmas festivities at the Toronto city council chamber

Ford, who has been stripped of most of 
his powers after he admitted smoking crack cocaine,  mopped his sweaty 
brow with a handkerchief after enthusiastically joining in with the 
celebrations.

It comes just days after pictures emerged of him clapping, singing and dancing bizarrely in front of a gospel congregation at the predominantly black West Toronto Church of God, where one churchgoer remarked that he ‘smells like ganja’.

The mayor looked far happier dancing in the council chamber than he did during the past few weeks when he has had to field questions 
from journalists about his drug and drink-fuelled antics.

The controversial 44-year-old has been plagued by a string of damaging stories since video emerged of him smoking a crack pipe.

This week he insisted he did not intend
 to suggest during a television interview that a Toronto Star reporter 
is a pedophile, but the journalist rejected the apology and said he 
would proceed with a defamation lawsuit.

Ford
 said it is 'unfortunate that the word I did not say has been ascribed 
to me by the media but I wish to sincerely apologize.'

Reporter Daniel Dale served Ford with a libel notice last week, demanding Ford apologize.

Ford,
 who admitted last month to smoking crack 'in a drunken stupor,' 
appeared on a Vision TV interview and accused Dale of taking pictures of
 his little kids.

Ford said he didn't 'want to say that word but you 
start thinking what this guy is all about.'

Dale has said he was writing a story 
about the plot so he went to take a look at it when the mayor emerged 
from his home to confront him. Dale said he didn't take any pictures and
 said the mayor's two children were nowhere in sight.

'I
 did not mean to insinuate anything about Mr. Dale personally in my 
interview,' Ford said in prepared remarks in City Council.

'I
 certainly did not intend to suggest that he is a pedophile. I was 
merely commenting on the thoughts that went through my mind on the 
night.'

Dale said on Twitter that Ford's apology was unsatisfactory.

'I asked Mayor Ford to 1) retract all 
of his false claims about my conduct and 2) issue an unreserved, abject,
 complete apology,' Dale tweeted.

'In
 his 'apology,' the mayor didn't retract anything at all. Instead, he 
blamed the media for its reasonable interpretation of his words.'

Ford has rebuffed intense pressure to resign over his admitted crack use and revelations of other erratic behavior.

The Toronto City Council has stripped him of most of his powers in an attempt to sideline him but the conservative mayor has vowed to seek re-election next year.

The bombastic mayor has not shied from the limelight. During a council session Tuesday, Ford danced vigorously to a band playing 'One Love' on the chamber floor - around the same time that Dale was sending his Twitter messages.

Ford has said he has quit drinking alcohol and is exercising daily after having a 'come to Jesus moment.'

His lawyer, Dennis Morris, said Ford has lost 26lbs in the last five weeks.

The mayor weighed himself in his office Tuesday and found he was down to 310lbs said Morris, who was at City Hall to pick up some bobblehead dolls of Ford to give as Christmas gifts.

The mayor has signed some of the bobbleheads for charity. Ford has taken pointed shots at the media, calling journalists maggots.

Allegations about Ford smoking crack surfaced in May when two reporters for the Toronto Star and one from the U.S. website Gawker said they saw a video of Ford appearing to smoke from a crack pipe, but they did not obtain a copy. Ford vilified the Star, accusing the paper of trying to take him down.

Ford first denied the tape existed but later when Toronto police announced in October they had obtained a copy, the mayor admitted he had smoked the drug.

Ford lashed out at Dale's bosses at the Toronto Star on Tuesday, saying they put him and Dale in this situation

Toronto City Councilor Shelley Carroll called Ford's apology 'insincere.'

'He's an expert at non apologies. He's been doing it for years. A real apology is `I caused you harm Daniel, I am sorry for that,' Carroll said.

'You'll never get an admission of guilt from Mayor Ford. It's not his style and it hasn't been since birth.'
