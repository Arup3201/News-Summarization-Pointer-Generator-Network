Britain is losing more from VAT loopholes on the sale of digital services than it cost to put on the Olympic Games, new research shows.

The study by a leading telecoms and digital consultancy reveals the HMRC is losing over £1.6billion a year in 
VAT on digital services bought by British consumers from overseas-based suppliers such 
as Amazon.

Greenwich Consulting estimates the UK will lose £10billion between 2008 and 2014. Ministers say the London Games cost taxpayers £9billion.

It comes as more pressure is being 
heaped on Chancellor George Osborne to close tax loopholes enjoyed by 
multinational companies in Wednesday's autumn statement.

The
chancellor is expected to find more cash in the autumn statement to 
fund a drive by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs to raise an additional
£10billion in tax revenues.

But
the revelation that Britain is losing so much revenue through tax 
loopholes will intensify demands at Westminster and beyond for tougher 
action on multinationals, such as Google and Starbucks, paying small 
amounts of tax.

The anti-tax
avoidance pressure group Uncut said that it was planning protests in 
Starbucks cafes this Saturday, involving 'creative civil disobedience'.

It follows stinging criticism of tax avoidance MPs on the public 
accounts committee who accused the coffee chain, Google and Amazon of 
'immoral' use of secretive jurisdictions, royalties and complex company 
structures to avoid paying tax on British profits.

Margaret Hodge, the committee's chair, said she had already stopped buying coffee at Starbucks and ceased using Amazon.

'Name and shame': The Public Accounts Committee chairman Margaret Hodge called on ministers to reveal firms that were not paying their fair share and suggested that the Government should back boycotts

'I
think actually the government can do things like … we buy a lot of 
stuff, we can say we won't buy from companies. I think it's good 
citizenship,' she told The Guardian.

The Prime Minister's official 
spokesman said: 'The issue for government is how we tackle that tax 
avoidance.

'What we have to do in government is make sure we are 
tackling that kind of aggressive tax avoidance. We are doing that in a 
number of ways. We are bringing in a general anti-avoidance rule, we are
working with other countries.'

The question of a boycott was 'an issue for individuals', said the spokesman.

Under
the EU's VAT rules, digital supplies to non-business customers – such 
as ebooks, music downloads and online apps – are classified as services 
rather than products.

'This is yet another example of 
industrial scale tax avoidance by foreign owned multinational 
corporations. Their behaviour is irresponsible, unethical and 
unacceptable.'

Charlie Elphicke MP

VAT 
on electronic services is imposed at the rate applying to the country in
which a company is headquartered rather than the rate applied by the 
country in which it is bought.

Amazon, for example, is based in Luxembourg and therefore charges its customers 3 per cent VAT for ebooks, compared with the 20 per cent levied in the UK.

Charlie Elphicke, a Conservative MP and a former tax lawyer, believes that the EU should accelerate plans to change the way VAT is charged on digital services, which is due to be phased in between 2015 and 2019.

'This is yet another example of industrial scale tax avoidance by foreign owned multinational corporations. Their behaviour is irresponsible, unethical and unacceptable,' he said.

The Greenwich report was commissioned by Philippe Marini, chairman of the French senate's finance committee and was prepared for a private meeting of pan-European politicians, civil servants and tax specialists in Brussels.

Mr Marini supports an earlier date for bringing into line with other goods the rules for charging EU VAT on digital services.

'At the European level we need to renegotiate the schedule for implementing the VAT directive on electronic services in order to bring its application deadline nearer than 2015 or 2019, the term of the transition phase,' he said.

An HMRC spokesman told The Guardian: 'It is a natural consequence of the VAT rules rather than any lack of compliance that a business in say, Germany, supplying such services to UK customers will account for VAT in Germany and not in the UK.

'Businesses have the freedom to establish themselves in whichever member state they wish.

'However, some UK businesses claimed to have moved their operations to other member states in order to benefit from lower VAT rates where in reality the supplies were still made from the UK. HMRC has successfully challenged such arrangements.'
