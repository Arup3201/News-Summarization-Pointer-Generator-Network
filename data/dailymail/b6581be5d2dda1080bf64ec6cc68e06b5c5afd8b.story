All hell broke loose during a religious celebration at a family home Thursday when a floor gave way and sent as many as 150 guests tumbling to the earth.

It was the Houston-area family's first ever party for a temple blessing ceremony in their second-floor apartment above a garage, but it only took the one to send 36 injured revelers to the hospital.

While there were no fatalities, at least one victim was wheeled away with serious head trauma and another was just 8 years old.

Out from under them: Hell broke loose in a Houston-area suburb Thursday afternoon when a family's temple blessing ceremony in their home's garage apartment crashed into the earth

In shock: The Katy, Texas family had invited over 100 people to the garage apartment above their home when the floor collapsed beneath them and injured 36 people

The collapse occurred while as many as 125 people gathered for the event in a residential neighborhood of Katy, just west of Houston. People were in a room above a detached garage when the floor gave way, though it wasn't immediately clear how many people were inside at the time, West I-10 Fire Department spokesman Tim Thomas said.

He said 36 people were taken to hospitals. Three people suffered 'urgent' but not critical injuries, while the others mostly suffered minor injuries, he said.

More than a dozen ambulances rushed to the scene shortly after the collapse was reported around 1 p.m. A few people were trapped when the floor above the garage 'pancaked in,' Houston Fire Department Captain Ruy Lozano said.

'The floor gave way,' Captain Lozano told Chron.com. 'It looked like it bowed.'

Neighbor Jill Allred did not attend the party, but descirbed the ensuing scene as total chaos. 'It's crazy,' Allred said. 'we can't get in or out of our neighborhood.'

He said emergency responders pulled victims from the building.

Firefighters and emergency crews treated people outside in a makeshift triage area set up in the front yards of nearby homes. Some of those injured were lifted onto stretchers before being taken away by ambulance.

One neighbor estimated that between 100 and 150 people were gathered at the family's two-story brick home, where the front doorway was decorated with red, turquoise and white fabric and a large white tent had been set up with stacks of folding chairs. Men were mostly dressed in white linen pants and shirts, while many women were dressed in brightly colored saris

Lozano said building inspectors don't regulate the number of people in such residential structures.

'We just have to use good judgment,' he said.

Tragically, it appears that the family was greatly looking forward to the day's religious festivities.

The family even sent their son around the neighborhood to pass out invitations.

'It was such a nice letter,' said neighbor Leticia Sahagan-Rubio, who nonetheless did not attent. 'I feel bad...they don't deserve this...This is the only party they've ever had.'

Sahagan-Rubio said many of them couldn't speak English, so she started
giving them water and letting them inside her home to make phone calls. She
said emergency crews started arriving almost immediately.

‘It was just a stream of ambulances. For 30 minutes, you
could hear nothing but ambulances,’ she said.

She said the family who lives at the home, an Indian couple
and their college-aged son, had sent neighbors letters a few days earlier
saying they would be holding a religious ceremony to bless a temple.

She estimated that between 100 and 150 people were gathered
at the family's two-story brick home, where the front doorway was decorated
with red, turquoise and white fabric and a large white tent had been set up
with stacks of folding chairs. Men were mostly dressed in white linen pants and
shirts, while many women were dressed in brightly colored saris.

Nobody was in the garage below the apartment when the floor
gave way, Thomas said. Witnesses told local television stations that people
were trying to hold up beams after the floor collapsed.
