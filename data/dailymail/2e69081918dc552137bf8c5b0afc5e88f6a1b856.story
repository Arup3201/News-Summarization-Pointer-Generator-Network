Fast food litter has hit record levels - and experts are blaming poorly-designed council bins.

Posting junk into narrow 'hatches' puts people off their lunch and means they throw their cartons on the street instead, said a government-backed report.

Instead councils should be using more bins with wide open rims so people know where they are putting their hands.

Rubbish design: Bins with narrow hatches put people off throwing away their junk properly, says a report

'People don't like to use bins that look full or dirty,' the report said. 'This is because people don't want to touch rubbish inside the bin and don't want to touch a dirty bin' - and ones with small hatches are worse

Campaign group Keep Britain Tidy revealed the criticism in its annual report on litter funded by the government.

It found fast food packages including napkins, plastic forks, cartons and salt sachets have shot up in the last decade, from 19 per cent of sites surveyed to 31 per cent.

They are now the fourth most common type of litter after smoking materials, sweet wrappers and drink cartons.

The report said there was more litter in areas with bins than in those without.

'Where a bin has been provided, it is not always being used,' the report said. 'This could be down to bin design, bin capacity, the bin's location or the frequency with which it is emptied.

'People don't like to use bins that look full or dirty. This is because people don't want to touch rubbish inside the bin and don't want to touch a dirty bin.

Rise: The report said the amount of litter from fast food has risen sharply in the last ten years to a record high

'Bins can become dirty from food and drink staining, chewing gum being stuck to them, and general dirt and grime building up over time.

'Sites with clean bins had significantly less fast food-related litter on the ground compared to sites with dirty bins, which indicates that the cleanliness of a bin has an impact on whether people will use it.'

It added: 'Our work with local authorities suggests that bins with a large opening and the ability to drop rubbish into them, rather than post the rubbish through a narrow opening, are preferable to users.'

But the report noted open-topped bins were not always the best answer as they encourage pests.

The Local Environmental Quality Survey of England was carried out by Keep Britain Tidy on behalf of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).

Worst offenders: Cigarette butts are still the biggest blight followed by sweet wrappers and drink cartons

Surveys were carried out at 7,200 sites in 45 English council areas between April 2013 and March 2014.

The survey looked at seven measures - cleanliness, detritus, weed growth, staining, graffiti, fly-posting and recent leaf and blossom fall.

Cigarette butts and empty packets remained by far the biggest blight on England's streets - found at almost three quarters of all sites surveyed.

But conditions were far worse in poor areas - 28 per cent of which were 'unacceptable' - than wealthy ones, where the figure was just 3 per cent.

Poorest areas had an average of 13 cigarette butts at each site while wealthiest ones had three, and dog mess dropped similarly from 14 per cent to 6 per cent. 

Keep Britain Tidy chief executive Phil Barton warned towns are suffering because of government cuts - but insisted people cannot rely on the state to clear up their mess.

Getting worse: The report said there was evidence that cuts to council budgets were having an impact

Deprivation: The poorest areas had the most cigarette butts, litter and dog mess, according to the report

'Cuts to local authority budgets continue and some indicators suggest that cleansing is beginning to suffer as a consequence,' he said. 

'We cannot afford to be complacent. If we want to keep our country clean and litter-free we cannot and must not rely on councils' capacity to "clean up after us".

'The large amount of public money we spend to keep England clean is unacceptable and a bill that we should not have to keep paying.'

Of the nine English regions the West Midlands was the cleanest, and the North West and Greater London were the dirtiest - partly because they had the most densely-packed residents. 

Liberal Democrat environment minister Dan Rogerson said: 'The increase in the prevalence of fast food-related litter over the past ten years is disappointing - packaging and litter associated with eating and drinking accounted for six of the ten most commonly littered items.'

He added: 'It is sad to see the correlation between poor local environment quality and deprivation.

'Some of the most disadvantaged members of our society also tend to have reduced access to the benefits to physical and mental health associated with high quality, clean, and safe public spaces

'At the same time, the evidence shows that poor levels of local environment quality are associated with increases in other low-level crime and social disorder, further compounding problems for the local community.'
