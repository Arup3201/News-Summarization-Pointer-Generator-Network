Usually the worst kind of distraction on the putting green is a well-timed sneeze from your playing partner. 

But golfers at one golf club are having to contend with a very different kind of rat-like cunning. 

Startled players at the North Weald club near Harlow in Essex have reported seeing a giant rodent lurking around the eighth hole.

On the run: This capybara was spotted lurking around the eighth hole at North Weald Golf Club in Essex

On further investigation the 4ft-long creature was identified as a capybara – the world’s largest type of rodent which is usually found grazing the plains of South America.

Assistant club manager Angus Lloyd-Skinner said: ‘A group reported seeing a giant rodent on the eighth and when we went to investigate we saw this huge creature the size of a small dog.

‘We didn’t know what it was until one of our members identified it. But we have no idea what it is doing on the course.’ 

At first it was thought the capybara had escaped from a zoo or private collection, or had been dumped by a bored pet owner.

Large size: Usually found in South America, capybaras can grow up to 2ft tall and weigh as much as 140lbs

Now Rob Dixon, manager at Ashlyns Farm Shop in Epping, has confirmed it is missing a male capybara.

He said: ‘We keep on trying to catch it, but as soon as we try and catch it,  it’s moved on or it jumps in the river and  shoots off. 

‘Next time we’ve got to get a vet out and try and tranquillise it.

‘They run away from humans – they’re quite shy. They’re not like a rat, they’re almost like a big hamster.’

Distant relatives of guinea pigs, capybara are grazing animals native to countries such as Argentina and Venezuela, where they are farmed for their meat and skins. 

They can grow up to 2ft tall and weigh as much as 140lbs.
