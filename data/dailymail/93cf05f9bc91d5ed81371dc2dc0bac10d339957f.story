The best side I ever faced were Arsenal’s Invincibles. They had quality all over the pitch, they were powerful and they hardly had any weaknesses. Now Chelsea are starting to look just as strong.

I don’t know if Jose Mourinho’s team can go unbeaten, but when you look through the squad they have so many options in every position.

If you want a war with them, they are up for the fight. If they want to open up the game, they’ve got the pace and skill of Eden Hazard and his midfield mates. And if they want to sit and play on the counter, they’ve got the speed and power of Diego Costa.

Cesc Fabregas has struck up a deadly partnership with Diego Costa. He has already set up FOUR of the striker’s NINE goals in the league.

He does not look like a man nursing a hamstring injury and his goal showed in a split second what Chelsea are about.

Cesc Fabregas picked the ball up like a quarterback in the pocket and sprayed an inch-perfect pass to Costa. Everyone knows what a powerhouse he is, but that finish showed he really does have everything. It was the kind of cute scoop you’d expect from a midfield maestro, not a ferocious forward like Costa.

Adam Lallana, starting to make a mark at Liverpool, celebrates his goal against West Brom on Saturday

LIFT OFF FOR LALLANA 

When I was at Southampton at the end of my career, I remember seeing a young Adam Lallana play.

The focus was on Gareth Bale and Theo Walcott but you could see his quality. But he was such a well-mannered lad you wondered if he had the drive to really kick on.

After playing for England and getting his move to Liverpool, it’s obvious that he does.

Now after such a quality goal, which our graphic below shows, he will feel more settled.

He’s not blessed with blistering pace but he’s so good with both feet and can drop a shoulder to find space. Now he has to go on and dominate games like he can.

IS YAYA BACK? HE NEVER LEFT! 

You could name an entire XI of top quality players who are suffering from a World Cup hangover, but Yaya Toure has been getting more stick than most.

He has not hit top gear yet — a bit like Man City — but I expect that goal against Villa to get the big man well and truly back into his stride.

Of course there’s room for improvement but he’s got so much quality and we’ve still not seen him ping in a free-kick or penalty yet. Don’t worry about Yaya, there’s plenty more to come.

Could this Yaya Toure goal for Manchester City against Aston Villa be the catalyst for a return to his best form?

TIME FOR SWANS TO BECOME LIONS

The way Wayne Routledge and Nathan Dyer are playing, they are making it very difficult for Roy Hodgson not to pick them for England.

They are scoring and making goals and offer so much pace out wide. 

Routledge scored a classy goal a few weeks ago and again against Newcastle while Dyer buzzes around causing teams problems. 

Roy Hodgson has already called up their team-mate Jonjo Shelvey. Maybe the two Swansea wingers are next up.

UNITED NEED WORK, BUT NOT IN GOAL 

Manchester United have a few things to sort out in their defence, but their goalkeeper is not one of them. David De Gea was excellent against Everton and his saves towards the end won his team the game.

When I first saw him playing for United he looked six stone wet through. There was barely anything of him and I always thought he wouldn’t be strong enough to make it.

David de Gea won the game for Manchester United over Everton with some incredible saves

Teams bullied him by whipping in crosses and packing the box to make life as uncomfortable as possible. He learnt from those experiences and he has improved dramatically. Now he takes total command of his area and is easily one of the best goalkeepers in the Premier League.

United still have a lot of work to do defensively, though. As good as De Gea is, they can’t keep asking him to produce world-class saves. He saved the day against Everton, but for United there is plenty of work to be done.

HAMMERS' TIDY TRANSFERS 

West Ham did some good business in the transfer window but one signing who came in a bit under the radar was Aaron Cresswell.

He’s made the step up from Ipswich but already looks so comfortable in a West Ham shirt. I came from a lower level at Bournemouth so know how difficult that transition can be, but he has made it look easy.

He plays with confidence, is good on the ball and he’s got a fine left foot, something every club is looking for. At 24 he might be a late developer, but he has made a solid start.

In their last three campaigns only one Sunderland player has scored 10 or more goals - STEVEN FLETCHER

Steven Fletcher celebrates one of his two goals against Stoke in Sunderland's big 3-1 win

FLETCHER MUST KEEP FIRING

That 3-1 victory over Stoke is a huge result for Sunderland. 

Gus Poyet has been waiting a long time for a win and they badly needed it.

Part of the problem has been a lack of goals and that’s because they lack a real out-and-out goalscorer.

When I look at their squad the only natural goalscorer I see is Steven Fletcher. 

He has always shown a lot of potential but has never quite been consistent enough.

The two goals on Saturday should give him the confidence he needs to go on and become his team’s go-to man for goals.
