Lionel Messi and Neymar were able to take a pre-Clasico early cut against Ajax after scoring in a 3-1 win against the Dutch champions.

With Saturday’s game looming large and Real Madrid still with Liverpool and the tail-end of hurricane Gonzalo to contend with, Barcelona took full advantage of playing the night before by taking off their two superstars midway through the second-half.

It nearly back-fired in the closing stages as Ajax scrambled a late goal but a point would have been more than they deserved after the home side dominated the 90 minutes.

On a night of goals galore in the Champions League the only surprise was that Barca had not put more distance between themselves and Ajax before Messi and Neymar were taken off, especially having opened their account so soon.

They have had problems scoring early this season but they carved Ajax open on eight minutes when Pedro fed Messi who released Neymar before the Brazilian found the far corner of Jasper Cillessen’s goal. It was his sixth goal for club and country in a week.

Messi could have doubled the lead on 11 minutes but shot over from the edge of the area. Ajax were open at the back and Barcelona were bright going forward, especially Pedro who was finally looking like a player who does not want to step aside and allow Luis Suarez to take his place. After a poor start to the season though, he may have left it late to stake that particular claim.

Messi got the second on 25 minutes - running on to Andres Iniesta’s threaded pass. Cillessen got his hand to the shot but could not stop it crossing his line.

It was his 69th goal in 89 Champions League games and it moved him to within two of Raul whose record breaking haul of 71 came in 144 games. The race to catch Raul could now be won by Cristiano Ronaldo who is also on 69 goals ahead of Wednesday’s game at Anfield.

Messi released Pedro for what might easily have been the third on the half hour but the latter hit a post.

Iniesta was the next to come agonisingly close, dribbling through the Ajax defence from Neymar’s pass only to be denied by Cillessen. It would have been the pick of the first-half goals and a corner, from which Barcelona rarely score, was scant reward for the brilliance.

Ajax forced two corners late in the first-half, one blocked by Marc Bartra, the other by his central defensive partner Gerard Pique, who was also caught in possession on his own byline but recovered well to clear.

VIDEO Victory and team spirit pleases Enrique 

Messi resumed the goal hunt at the start of the second-half, scoring from Pedro’s saved shot only for an offside flag to rule the effort out.

He then dribbled through Ajax’s six-yard box with mesmerizing close control, the ball never leaving his laces, defenders floundering, only for his shot to hit the side-netting.

As the close control from Messi, Neymar and Alves reached new levels, Ajax’s defenders were made to look even more clumsy with Alves unceremoniously up-ended on the edge of the penalty area by Nick Viergever. On the hour they were at least spared further punishment from Neymar who was replaced by Sandro and Messi followed him five minutes later.

Some had questioned if Luis Enrique was strong enough to substitute his most famous player after images from the weekend league game seemed to show Messi being asked if he wanted to come off and asking to be left on.

This was Luis Enrique showing who is boss, and Messi getting some extra rest ahead of Saturday’s Clasico.

Ajax seemed to be breathing a little more easily after the changes and, with two minutes left, Anwar El Ghazi scored to make it 2-1 but before they could dare to dream of earning an undeserved point Sandro scored Barcelona's third.
