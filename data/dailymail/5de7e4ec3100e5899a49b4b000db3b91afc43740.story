From spiked clubs to makeshift pitchforks, these are the improvised weapons that brought down the Ukrainian government.

The deadly weapons, used by anti-government protestors, were captured by photographer Tom Jamieson on the streets of the capital, Kiev.

They include climbers' ice axes, metre-long hammers, stun grenades and wooden sticks with heavy metal bars chained to the end.

Chilling: The lethal items, used by anti-government protestors, were captured by photographer Tom Jamieson on the streets of the capital, Kiev. Above, a spiked club

Ready to attack: They include climbers' ice axes, metre-long hammers, baseball bats, stun grenades, personalised body armour and makeshift pitchforks (pictured)

The chilling weaponry was pictured being held by protestors in the capital's Independence Square, known as the Maidan, in front of a black backdrop.

In February, more than 20,000 anti-government stormed the streets of Kiev in bid to overthrow a government led by president Victor Yanukovych following months of sit-ins and demonstrations.

They hurled fire bombs, large rocks and other makeshift devices at police officers in riot gear, who returned their fire with rubber bullets and later, live ammunition.

They eventually managed to take control of the capital and oust Yanukovych - sparking the ongoing Crimean crisis, dubbed the second Cold War, between Russia and Ukraine.

Mr Jamieson, who visited frontlines, tents and occupied buildings during the protests in a bid to photograph the weapons, said: 'For five months, Maidan Square and its adjacent streets of Grushevskogo and Khreschatyk became home to protestors, revolutionaries and soldiers from all over Ukraine in a bid to overthrow the corrupt government.

'The occupation was largely DIY in nature, from barricades made from tyres and sand bags filled with snow, to the motley assortment of foreign and soviet era body armour worn by those opposing the government.  

'Most striking and inventive of all are the weapons of the protestors, which are fashioned from wood, steel or plastic. Each is completely unique to its owner and often personalised with inscriptions or revolutionary imagery.

Dangerous: 'Most striking and inventive of all are the weapons of the protestors, which are fashioned from wood, steel or plastic,' he said. Above, a heavy metal bar

Unique: 'Each is unique to its owner and often personalised with inscriptions or revolutionary imagery,' he added. Above, a stick inscribed with the word 'peacemaker'

'This series catalogues the homemade weapons of the revolutionaries which stand in stark comparison to the modern, automatic weapons recently employed against them by government forces.'

The photographer said he started the project during the final few days of a two-week trip to Kiev in a bid to show something 'new and different'.

'I spent two weeks photographing the protests getting constantly more frustrated that I wasn't contributing anything new to the coverage,' he said.

Stark contrast: The images catalogue the homemade weapons of the revolutionaries which stand in stark contrast to the automatic weapons of government forces

Terrifying: A demonstrator holds a wooden stick with a heavy metal bar chained to the end, which was likely used against riot police during the clashes last month

Hazardous: Mr Jamieson said he started the project during the final few days of a two-week trip to Kiev in a bid to show something 'different'. Above, a shotgun shell

Armed and ready: Two unnamed protestors stand on the streets of Kiev (left) amid the violent clashes, while another demonstrator holds a deadly-looking hammer (right)

'It was actually only during my last few 
days in Kiev that I came up with the idea to focus purely on the weapons
 and remove them from the chaotic background of what was taking place
 on Maidan Square.

'I think they reveal a lot about the personalities of the protestors. Many of the weapons hold inscriptions and slogans. They were a point of pride for the protestors and each was completely unique to its owner.

'I also think that despite looking brutal and menacing they show the total futility of such weapons against automatic weapons.'

Protection: Mr Jamieson said he thought the weapons revealed a lot about the protestors' personalities. Above, a personalised helmet, featuring a woman with a halo

Shield: The weapons were a point of pride for the protestors and each was completely unique to its owner,' he said. Above, a man shields himself with a metal pole

Ready to launch: He added that the process of taking the photos was 'very simple'. Above, a protestor holds a jagged rock, which would likely later be thrown at riot police

He added that the process he undertook was 'very simple', saying: 'I walked around to different parts of the protest, the front lines, the tents, the occupied buildings and asked to see everyone's weapons.

'We shot it against a black backdrop that was held behind each weapon and we tried to shoot early in the morning and just as the light was going in the evening to get a consistency in the lighting.'
