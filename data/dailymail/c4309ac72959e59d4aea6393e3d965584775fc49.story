Mr and Mrs Wycherley were last seen in 1998, and would be 100 and 79 years old respectively if they were still alive.

Last month, police starting digging up the garden of their home in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire after receiving a tip-off.

They recovered two sets of human remains and launched a murder investigation.

Following a post-mortem examination, it emerged that both the people buried in the garden had been shot dead.
