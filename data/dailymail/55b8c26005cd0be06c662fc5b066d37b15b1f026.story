A 10-year-old boy who has raised thousands of pounds for charity since he lost his mother to cancer has been immortalised in a Lego statue.

Jack Covill-Lowndes, from Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, was nominated by his family in a competition run by Legoland to find a real life hero.

He has raised thousands of pounds for charity since his mother Steph lost her fight with cancer in 2006.

Real life hero: Jack Covill-Lowndes Lego likeness was created when he was selected by Legoland as a deserving hero

Final touches: The statue is made from 53,000 Lego bricks modelled to match the 10-year-old's height, colouring and clothes

Jack beat thousands of other nominees to be named Lego City Hero and today came face-to-face with a life-size Lego version of himself at Legoland in Windsor.

Around 35,000 of the famous Lego bricks were used to build the statue of 4ft 6ins Jack.

Jack's aunt and guardian Tamara Lowndes put him forward due to his continued support and fundraising on behalf of St Barnabas Hospice, which cared for his mother.

After the figure was unveiled, Jack said: 'It's awesome. They've even made the same clothes I was wearing out of Lego - I can't stop looking at my statue!'

Inspiration: After his mother's death in 2006, Jack Covill-Lowndes has fundraised and campaigned for cancer charities

The figure will remain at Legoland in Windsor until the end of September before being sent to Jack's house for him to keep.

Ms Lowndes said: 'It's fantastic - but I've no idea where I can keep it. Jack wants it in his bedroom but I think that it'll make a great garden ornament!'

Harry Harrison, from Lego, said: 'Jack's story really captured the essence of a real-life, everyday hero.

'He's a real inspiration - and to be immortalised in Lego is befitting of his amazing outlook and achievements.'
