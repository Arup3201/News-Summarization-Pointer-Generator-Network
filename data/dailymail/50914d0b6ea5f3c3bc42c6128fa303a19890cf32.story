It has been a week of joy for Sonia Kruger after announcing she is expecting her first child with partner Craig McPherson.

And the 49-year-old Mornings presenter has opened up about how she has been dealing with the rollercoaster of emotions that come with her exciting news made possible by a close friend offering to be an egg donor.

Speaking to the Australian Women's Weekly, Sonia has revealed the couple of five years and her friend have undergone counselling in order to prepare for the birth of the child and determine her friend's involvement in the baby's life.

'All of these things have to be discussed at length and agreed before the egg donation process begins,' she told the magazine.

Opening up: Sonia Kruger has opened up about how she has been dealing with the emotions that have come along with her exciting news of being pregnant 

It has undoubtedly been a tough journey for the Channel Nine personality, having fallen pregnant naturally a few times before the pregnancies ended in miscarriage.

With her strong desire to start a family, the blonde beauty decided to give IVF a go at the age of 45.

But having found little luck with the fertility treatment, the next stop was to look at options overseas.

Last year Sonia travelled to South Africa for an egg donor, however the embryo didn't take. 

Proactive: The 49-year-old presenter has revealed she and her partner of five years Craig McPherson have undergone counselling sessions with Sonia's friend who kindly offered to be the egg donor 

It was then the option of speaking to someone closer to home that became more of a reality.

Appearing on A Current Affair on Monday night, Sonia revealed to presenter Leila McKinnon she is expecting a girl thanks to her friend's kind gesture.

'The egg came from a very good friend of mine…we were having conversation about it one day and she knew that I had struggled, and I said "Look it’d all be fine if you would just give me one of your eggs!"'

'She said, "okay!," and that's how it all came about.'

When asked if having an egg donor will affect her emotionally, the Channel Nine presenter seemed far from phased.

It's a girl! Appearing on A Current Affair on Monday night, Sonia revealed the sex of the baby 

'The idea of having an egg donor didn’t feel unusual to me...I'm not that in love with my own DNA to be honest with you!'

And she had similar sentiments when it came to her age, which she said 'is irrelevant when it comes to being a good or loving parent.'

Just days later, showing off her small baby bump in a figure-hugging black-and-white gown on Monday's show, Kruger was candid as she spoke about her IVF treatment and fertility fears.

'When you get to my age, to use your own eggs to have a baby...you're not really going to be successful,' she reasoned to guest co-host Richard Wilkins.

'The odds are sort of one in a million and my doctors had been very clear with me because I'd had IVF before.

At four months pregnant, she said that during her first trimester 'it was almost as if I couldn't let myself feel happy because it had happened before: I had fallen pregnant before but the pregnancy hadn't progressed.'

'When I went for the first scan and saw a heartbeat that I had never seen before, that was incredible,' she added.

 Also reflecting on the heart warming experience with the Australian Women's Weekly, Sonia said: 'I even Googled buying a personal ultrasound machine so I could check it at home.' 

The news was particularly exciting for Kruger's co-host David Campbell, who already has one young son and whose wife Lisa is expecting twins.

Kruger joked that she 'felt so sorry for David' because he has to deal with two hormonal pregnant women at home and at work.'
