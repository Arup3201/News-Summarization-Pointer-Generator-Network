Gruesome: A police Evofit of the thug who plunged a syringe into the neck of a woman on her doorstep

A thug plunged a hypodermic needle into the neck of a woman as she stood at her front door in a gruesome but apparently random attack.

After knocking at the front door, the attacker issued a sinister threat to his 41-year-old victim before thrusting the syringe in her neck and running off.

The woman, whose name has not been released, was rushed to hospital for treatment, where doctors tested her for hepatitis and Aids.

Hypodermic needles are commonly used by heroin addicts. Used needles can harbour blood-borne diseases that can permanently affect the lives of those who contract them.

She was later discharged after tests came back all clear.

Today, Greater Manchester Police said officers were investigating a theory that the woman was attacked in a horrifying case of mistaken identity.

The thug struck just after noon on Sunday July 29, after knocking on the door of the woman's home in Blackley, Manchester.

Police said she opened it to see who it was before the man pushed and threatened her.

He then speared her with the syringe before yanking it from her neck and fleeing down the street.

The woman has told police she did not know the man who stabbed her - although the assault appeared to be targeted, leading to the theory that it was a case of mistaken identity.

Det Con Mike Keogh from Greater Manchester Police said: 'The victim has been left shaken after her ordeal and is now frightened to open her door to anyone.

'Thankfully she was not seriously hurt and nothing was injected but we are still treating this as a serious assault.

'I would ask people to take a good look at the image and description of the offender. If you recognise him, please contact police as soon as possible so we can get him of our streets.'

The man is described as being of slim build, 5ft 10in tall, clean shaven, was in his late 20s/early 30s and spoke with a local accent.

He was wearing a black woolly hat, navy blue Nike tracksuit bottoms and a black coat.
