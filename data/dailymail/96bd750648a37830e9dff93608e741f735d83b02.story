There was a cold expression on Louis Van Gaal's face as he stood on the pitch, one hand in pocket, digesting Holland's exit from the World Cup.

There was an air of disbelief that somehow his plans had not come off and Argentina really had just beaten them on penalties to reach the World Cup final.

But he will not have long to mourn, a new challenge is afoot at Manchester United and we have already been given a sneak preview of what English football can expect next season. This is no ordinary manager.

Sportsmail takes a look at what we've learned about the giant Dutchman during this tournament...

STRENGTHS

Van Gaal is bold to the point of fearlessness.

This was epitomised in his substitution of Robin Van Persie in their last 16 match against Mexico.

Holland were a goal down with 15 minutes to play. The last person anyone expected to be taken off – particularly the Dutch fans – was the star striker and captain.

Van Gaal didn't even flinch as he primed Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and hooked Van Persie.

He didn't even waver when considering that if Van Persie had lost the plot, this was also one of the key players he would be managing at Manchester United next season.

The Dutch players began firing balls up to Huntelaar on Van Gaal's orders. In the final two minutes they turned the game on its head.

Huntelaar won the knock-down header from a corner to set up Wesley Sneijder's 88th-minute equaliser then confidently converted the match-winning penalty, won by Arjen Robben, in stoppage time.

WEAKNESSES

Very few weaknesses can be ascribed to the man, and perhaps no major ones.

His age, 62, could perhaps be considered one for United fans. Even if he tears through the Barclays Premier League in a whirlpool of success, he will never be able to provide the longevity of Sir Alex Ferguson.

It is also worth noting that despite the winning aura surrounding the Dutchman he has won just two league titles and one German Cup in the past 15 years and in spells at two other European heavyweights – one at Bayern Munich and two at Barcelona – he failed to shine.

TOUCH OF GENIUS

In living rooms, pubs, bars, beaches with big screens, slums and street parties across the globe, people turned to each other in bewilderment when Van Gaal substituted goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen for Tim Krul in extra-time stoppage time of their quarter-final match against Costa Rica.

Krul had not played a single minute of the tournament. The game was going into penalties. Everyone assumed Krul had an impeccable penalty record. In fact, he'd saved just two of his previous 20.

Sports psychologist Cary Cooper explained: 'Van Gaal making such a surprising change just before such a high-stress event would have made it much worse for the Costa Ricans. They would have something else to think about. It would play on their minds.'

It got to the the Costa Ricans and Krul saved two to send his side through.

TACTICS

In this World Cup Holland have played 5-3-2, 4-3-3, 3-4-3, 5-2-3 (at times almost a 7-3-0) and against Argentina on Wednesday night in an attempt to deal with Lionel Messi they switched to 6-3-1 when they didn't have the ball.

Although they didn't win, that particular tactic worked and Messi cut a frustrated figure all night.

Van Gaal will change tactics at half-time, on the touchline, in his sleep, over dinner, at his kids' birthdays, or even in the drinks break against Mexico with just 14 minutes of the match remaining and his side trailing by a single goal. That, again, worked when they overturned the deficit.

'It's all about winning,' Van Gaal said. 'I want to win. I'm going to pick a system that will help me win.'

DISCIPLINE

Only a leader who can instil strict discipline in his players could get them to function in so many different systems in one tournament. Sometimes in a single game. And Van Gaal is famous for his discipline.

When at Bayern Munich he insisted that players must eat in the same seat and sit up straight during team meals.

Van's the man: The Dutch players listen intently as their boss delivers a stern team-talk in Sao Paulo 

One afternoon at lunch, he noticed Luca Toni was slouched over his plate. When Toni ignored his shouts across the canteen, Van Gaal strode over, pulled the 6ft 3ins Toni up by his collar and forced him up-right. From then on, everyone sat up at meals. Toni left the club within a year.

His discipline also extends back home. In Dutch there is an informal and formal version of the word 'you.' Van Gaal makes his two daughters, Brenda and Renate, use the formal version when they speak to him.

PERSONALITY

Clarence Seedorf played for Van Gaal in the glorious Ajax team of the mid-1990s which won three league titles, the Uefa Cup and Champions League.

'Van Gaal has a strong, explosive personality that brings some extra stuff sometimes but his track record speaks for itself,' Seedorf said during this tournament.

It will be interesting to see what is hidden behind this 'extra stuff' but there is no doubt that Van Gaal will enter Old Trafford in a shower of fireworks.

The Football Association should brace themselves. In four weeks of this World Cup he has absolutely laid into FIFA.

Just look at his face: The pair celebrate Van Persie's stunning header against Spain in the group stage 

About the unfair fixture list favouring Brazil. 'FIFA plays these tricks,' he said. About the fact he had 'no view' from his dugout at Estadio Beira-Rio in Port Alegre when they played Australia. About the third and fourth place play-off, blasting FIFA after their defeat to Argentina. 'This game has nothing to do with sports in my opinion,' he raged. 'There is only one prize and one award that counts for anything and that is becoming champion.'

In fact, everyone should brace themselves: English football is in for a treat.
