‘Three goalkeepers one problem’ was the headline on one of Madrid’s leading sports papers Diario AS on Friday morning. Real Madrid want to complete the signing of Keylor Navas from Levante but they already have Iker Casillas and Diego Lopez.

Over at Marca, the rival of Diario AS, a solution was being offered. Maybe Lopez could be sold to Chelsea, after all it was Jose Mourinho who signed him for Real Madrid in the first place. All well and good apart from the fact that Chelsea already have Petr Cech and Thibaut Courtois.

The surplus of good keepers, along with the stockpiling of talent at most top Champions League clubs means that Petr Cech, Pepe Reina, Iker Casillas, Joe Hart, Victor Valdes, Diego Lopez, Marc-Andre ter Stegen and Wojciech Szczesny could all be sat on the bench for large parts of next season because their clubs also have Courtois, Simon Mignolet, Keylor Navas, Claudio Bravo, Willy Caballero and David Ospina to pick instead.

You can argue about the details. Hart will probably keep his place ahead of Caballero (although believing that to be a formality is to ignore how Caballero has been among the top three goalkeepers in Spain in each of the last three seasons). Likewise Casillas might keep his place ahead of Navas. And Szczesny could well fend off Ospina’s challenge. But however the chips fall there will be a lot of very good keepers not playing regularly.

Atletico Madrid were expected to ease the congestion by signing one of the surplus stoppers but they opted instead for another young talent – Jan Oblak the 21-year-old Slovenian - so there are still too many keepers for the places available and the way the World Cup was dominated by goalkeepers has done nothing to change that.

Mexico’s Guillermo Ochoa has earned a move to Malaga after his performance against Brazil. And after finishing third in Fifa’s Golden Glove rating Serio Romero moved to Benfica. Victor Valdes’ injury ruined his proposed move to replace Romero at Monaco. The Ligue 1 club could yet offer Diego Lopez a way out of Madrid.

Settling for No 2 status is one alternative open to him and maybe, if Cech were to move to PSG, Lopez could end-up as Courtois’ stand-in at Chelsea. But experienced number twos only served to block the progress of young keepers – the highly rated Jordi Masip now finds his path to the first team blocked by Bravo and Ter Stegen at Barcelona. And the senior goalkeepers themselves invariably suffer.

Coaches and directors of football might say that is just part of the modern game – top clubs need two first-team keepers.  But the performances of Casillas in the Champions League final and World Cup after a season on the bench during Real Madrid’s league campaign suggest it doesn’t exactly improve personal performance.

Most goalkeepers believe they have to be playing every week to reach top form. That’s why Keylor Navas was not interested in a move to Bayern Munich where he would have spent most of this time watching Manuel Neuer. It may yet convince him to turn down Real Madrid though his chances of dethroning Casillas in the near future are better than they would have been of ousting Neuer. The musical chairs continues – and with ever fewer chairs.
