The Glasgow pub where 10 people were killed when a police helicopter crashed through the roof is planning to reopen 18 months after the tragedy.

The Clutha in Glasgow city centre has been shut since November 29, 2013, when the Eurocopter EC 135 crashed into the building, killing seven customers and three police officers.

Much of the pub had been left untouched since the night of the disaster, but building work is now underway and owner Alan Crossan hopes to reopen by May.

The Clutha in Glasgow city centre has been shut since November 29, 2013, when the Police Scotland helicopter crashed into the building

The helicopter crash killed all three police officers on board and seven customers who were drinking in the pub at the time of the incident

The pub has remained closed since the incident in November 2013 but building work is now underway as part of attempts to clear debris

Much of the pub has been left untouched since the crash, with glasses and live music flyers still strewn across the pub from the night

Drinks and mixers remain untouched on the bar at The Clutha, which has been situated on the banks of the River Clyde since 1819

Owner Alan Crossan said it has been incredibly difficult to decide what to with the pub since the crash but now hopes to reopen by May

He said the pub's adjoining Victoria Bar is to be refurbished, while the beer garden at the back of The Clutha will be covered over.

He has not yet decided what to do with the area of the building where the Police Scotland helicopter crashed.

He said: 'It's difficult, it's taken me a year and a bit to even get to this stage. Maybe in six months, maybe in a year, I'll know better what to do with this.

'Obviously, when we get people back in and the music starts again, we'll get a better idea of what we can do.

'The name will stay. The Clutha, before the accident, was pretty famous anyway, so the name will always stay. The Clutha means the Clyde and we're right next door to the Clyde, so we'll retain that.'

He added: 'Obviously in its day it was a pub that was really happy and it was always a good pub, there were never any issues in it, so it's got a feeling now where it's strange, I could take a long, long time to figure out what to do with it.'

The bar area of The Clutha took the main impact of the crash, while those in the area where a band was playing were initially unaware that a helicopter had crashed into the building.

Thick dust covers much of the pub's original features and debris is strewn across the premises following the tragic helicopter crash

Many drinks and glasses can still be seen in the bar area, which was ripped apart when the helicopter crashed through the pub's roof

Mr Crossan said it could take a 'long, long time to figure out what to do' with the pub but currently has plans to reopen it by May 1

Many glasses can still be found half-empty dotted around the pub, while food menus and live music posters are also scattered around

Glasses, many still half-filled with drink, could still be seen all around the pub today - some on the bar, some overturned on crates (above)

Mr Crossan said building work is now underway to clear the rubble and debris and help refurbish the pub ahead of a reopening in May

Customers were forced to flee the pub when the helicopter plummeted through the roof, but many were killed instantly by the aircraft crash

The pub was hosting a live music event at the time of the helicopter crash in November 2013 and the pub was packed with customers

Inside The Clutha today, the scene looks largely as it would have done on the night of the disaster, when customers fled the building in panic.

A glass stands on the bar counter with change next to it, while an unfinished drink is on a crate on the stage.

Scattered flyers lie on the floor near the stage, while thick dust covers surfaces.

Pilot David Traill, who was attached to the Police Scotland air support unit, and police constables Tony Collins and Kirsty Nelis were killed in the helicopter crash.

Those killed in the pub were John McGarrigle, Mark O'Prey, Gary Arthur, Colin Gibson, Robert Jenkins and Samuel McGhee. Joe Cusker was pulled from the wreckage alive but later died in hospital.

An initial report said the aircraft suffered engine failure but the final conclusions of the Air Accidents Investigation Branch are expected to be released later this year. 

The pub's exterior remains largely intact but needs some cosmetic work following the incident in November 2013 which killed 10 people

Workers could be seen at the pub today clearing debris and carrying out works to ensure the structure of the pub remains safe and sound

Soft drinks bottles could be found strewn across the floor of the pub while paperwork also remained on the floor following the crash

Salt and pepper shakers, Tabasco sauce and beer mats all remain on the bar top following the crash which closed the pub in late 2013

Dust covers much of the pub and Mr Crossan acknowledged that a large amount of work would need to be undertaken before reopening

Spirit bottles behind the bar on the night of the crash have been left to gather dust, while kitchen appliances also remain untouched

The Clutha (pictured before) has sat by the River Clyde in Glasgow since 1819

The Clutha, where the Police Scotland helicopter crashed in November 2013, has sat staunchly by the River Clyde since 1819.

It has helped foster Glasgow’s bustling music scene and has played host to the occasional celebrity.

Named after the Latin name for the River Clyde, which runs through Glasgow, it was twinned with the nearby Scotia Bar, the oldest drinking establishment in the city.

It was once the final stop for the Clutha boats, or ‘penny steamers’ that would take people to and from work in the Forth of Clyde, once the centre of the world’s shipbuilding industry.

More recently it has counted Glasgow residents including comedian Billy Connolly and socialist politician Tommy Sheridan as patrons.

It is now a noted live music venue, with performances most nights. Ska band Esperanza were playing on the night of the performance.

The pub even plays a bit part in the story of war hero Private Jimmy Stokes, who charged into an occupied German building on his own in 1945.

It was his last stop in his hometown before heading to war, where he bested the Germans but was fatally wounded and died overseas, being posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross.

The Clutha was also a favoured haunt of Scottish socialist Tommy Sheridan, who led protests against the poll tax in 1989 and was jailed twice.

Although tee-total, he spent hours in The Clutha drinking coffee before handing himself over an unpaid court fine for causing a disturbance at a protest.

Another tee-total star often spotted in the pub was Scottish comedian Billy Connolly. The entertainer, who now lives in the U.S., was even linked to an alleged assault at the venue in 1997 in the wake of a footballing triumph by local team Celtic.

The comedian reportedly lashed out when a press photographer tried to take a picture of him.
