Mario Balotelli has been blasted by his former AC Milan team-mate Adel Taarabt.

The pair played together at the San Siro last season and Taarabt has painted a picture of Balotelli as a selfish forward who doesn't try for his team-mates, doesn't score often enough and has thrown away four brilliant career opportunities at Inter Milan, Manchester City, AC and now Liverpool.

Taarabt also stated that even though he was led to believe Balotelli was 'amazing', having seen the the Italian forward up close last year, he 'did not seem like a world-class player'.

Balotelli has netted just twice for Liverpool since his £16million summer transfer from Milan, and has yet to score in the Premier League this season.

Speaking on Italian TV, Queens Park Rangers midfielder Taarabt said: ‘Everybody told me he (Balotelli) was amazing.

‘I played with him and I can confirm he’s good, but he didn’t seem like a world-class player to me.

‘He has a strong shot but he doesn’t play for the team. Or if he does, then he doesn’t score which is the case now with Liverpool.

‘He had a lot of chances, from Manchester City to Milan, and he threw them all away.’
