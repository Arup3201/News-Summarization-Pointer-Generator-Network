Campers staged a mini-festival 180ft up on the roof of the O2 arena in central London today.

The group pitched 12 tents on the tiny platform on top of the Dome for what the organisers were describing as the 'highest festival in Britain'.

To reach the platform on top of the iconic building revellers had to scramble up a 30 degree slope with climbing gear.

The rooftop has stunning views of the Canary Wharf skyscrapers, the Olympic Stadium and central London's famous landmarks.

The 'festival-goers' went up onto the roof today as it was announced the O2 will host the Campus Party Europe digital technology event later this year.

Revellers danced to live streamed music on the rooftop as the announcement was made.

The arena, which started life as the Millennium Dome, has a capacity of 20,000 people - but the viewing platform on the top barely holds two dozen.

Outstanding views: From the top of the arena it is possible to see the Olympic Stadium in the east, as well as some of London's most famous landmarks

Campus Party Europe will be held at the O2 in September and is organised by telephone company Telefonica.

The O2 arena cost nearly Â£800million to build in the 1990s and reopened as an indoor arena in 2007 after the millennium exhibition.

Although it has never hosted a rooftop concert before, Justin Bieber, Elton John, JLS, Madonna, Take That and the Spice Girls are among the acts who have performed inside.
