India's Anirban Lahiri won his second European Tour title in the space of three weeks after beating compatriot SSP Chawrasia in a play-off at Delhi Golf Club on Sunday.

Lahiri, who won the Malaysian Open a fortnight ago, began the final round seven shots off the lead but a closing 69 was enough to force extra holes as overnight leader Chawrasia stumbled to a 76.

The home pair returned to the par-five 18th for the play-off and with Chawrasia unable to make par after hooking his tee shot into the trees, Lahiri holed from 10 feet for birdie.

Lahiri had been four over par after 10 holes of his opening round but the win solidifies his place in the top 50 of the world rankings and effectively secures his Masters debut in April.

The 27-year-old had crucially chipped in for par on the 17th in regulation as a number of players squandered chances to either win the title outright or join the play-off.

Sweden's Joakim Lagergren, Thailand's Prayad Marksaeng, Sri Lanka's Mithun Perera and Australian Marcus Fraser all finished on six under, with Perera the only player to birdie the par-five 18th.

Marksaeng three-putted the last from long range for par, while Fraser held the outright lead on nine under par after 12 holes only to double-bogey the 13th and drop another shot on the 16th.

Bangladesh's Siddikur Rahman began the day two off the lead on 10 under but slumped to a 76, like Chawrasia, to finish five under par.
