Sitting pretty: Marina Asenova says her face was used on Sally Hansen cosmetics but she never received a payment

A model agency is apparently refusing to pay one its former female talents for a near decade-long endorsement deal with Sally Hansen, made without her permission.

Marina Asenova from Bulgaria, decided to sue New York-based MC2 Models last year after she spotted her image plastered on boxes of hair removal and bleaching cream while a trip to the U.S.

She claimed she was unaware of the modelling contract and never received payment. Instead, the agency, which should have made a small percentage from the deal, took the full cut.

However, its co-founder Jeffrey Fuller told the Daily News that it does not owe the five-foot-nine-inch brunette anything because 'it no longer represents her' and she was 'an average model at best'.

He continued: 'Ms. Asenova was never a supermodel . . . It’s a shame her career has dwindled down to the point [where she’s suing for money].'

He apparently claims that he can no longer find payment records and he told MailOnline that she has been ‘paid in full’ based on the original terms.

Now a frustrated Ms Asenova has turned her attention to Sally Hansen's parent company, Coty Cosmetics, which she claims continue to use her image.

Last week she filed an amended suit in Manhattan Supreme Court demanding that the beauty giant pulls items with her face on, off shelves.

Her lawyer, Tom Mullaney says his client just wants the money she is owed.

'She wasn’t too average to hire, but she was too average to pay,' he explained. 'I hope they tell that to the judge.'

Ms Asenova was represented by MC2 Models while she lived in Manhattan, but parted ways with the agency when she returned to Europe in 2006.

But on a trip back to the city, she 
nipped into a Duane Reade pharmacy and saw her image had been used on 
hair removal and hair bleaching products.

Modelling
 agency MC2 Models never paid her for the deal with Coty Cosmetics - 
then Sally Hansen Cosmetics - according to court papers.

'I guess they figured she'd never find out about it,' her lawyer Mr Mullaney previously told the New York Post.

Ms
 Asenova filed a lawsuit against MC2 Models, which has offices in New 
York, Miami and Tel Aviv, charging them with breach of contract and 
unjust enrichment.

She allegedly claimed that 80per cent of the money earned from the campaign should be hers

Yet
 the exact amount is not clear, as MC2 Models is allegedly refusing to let her 
know how much they earned from the deal, or even show her the contract.

She
 discovered her face on products in the hair care aisle, including brush
 on hair remover, in which she appears to be holding an applicator to 
the camera.

Her face also appears on hair bleach products, which bear the Sally Hansen logo.

Cover model Ms Asenova has appeared in campaigns for Yves Saint Laurent and Olay, among others.

She also has representation in London, Switzerland and Germany.

A rep for Coty Cosmetics declined to comment on the matter.
