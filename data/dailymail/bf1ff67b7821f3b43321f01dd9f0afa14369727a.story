Style icon: Alexa Chung attends a Mulberry party in New York, clutching her signature bag by the luxury brand

Sometimes it seems no celebrity outfit would be complete without a Mulberry bag.

And the luxury British brand is reaping the rewards of its A-list endorsement, after it posted a 54 per cent surge in profits.

Mulberry has benefited from its association with fashion icon Alexa Chung and, more recently, American singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey.

The Alexa bag has become a modern classic, with the standard version selling out from Beijing to New York despite a price tag of £785, while an Oak Ostrich version was listed at £3,750.

The firm’s £795 Del Rey bag, which was launched in the spring,  has also been hugely successful.

Sienna Miller carried the bag to actor Robert Pattinson’s birthday party in London last month, while Oscar-nominated actress Jennifer Lawrence is also a fan.

Such is the allure of the Mulberry name that some see its luxury bags as an investment that will maintain and even increase in value – much like gold.

Mulberry told the City yesterday it had been helped by strong trading in Asian markets and a 30 per cent rise in sales from 45 stores and concessions in the UK.

The firm has recently announced plans to open a second factory in Somerset, creating 300 jobs and doubling its UK capacity.

The £7.5million project in Bridgwater, which is being supported by the Regional Growth Fund, comes less than a year after it completed the extension of its existing factory at Chilcompton, Somerset, creating 60 jobs.

But the company admitted that sales growth has slowed in recent weeks, an announcement that was seized on by City analysts.

As a result, shares in the business, which was founded by Roger Saul and his mother Joan in 1971, slumped by around 25 per cent in early trading.

The company itself is confident of growing to become a powerful global brand and recently appointed Frenchman Bruno Guillon, former managing director of luxury brand Hermes, as chief executive.

Chairman Godfrey Davis said: ‘While 
the current economic conditions make the short term trading outlook more
challenging in some markets, we remain confident about Mulberry's 
long-term future.’

Matthew McEachran, an analyst at Singer Capital Markets, said despite the fall-back in growth in sales and the fact profits were slightly below expectations, the prospects for the group remain ‘exciting’.

The group plans to open between 15 and 20 international stores this year, including in South Korea, San Francisco, Singapore, Japan and Shanghai.

Jaana Jatyri, chief executive of fashion forecaster Trendstop.com, said: ‘More than even Burberry, perhaps, Mulberry is a brand that has benefited from the growing demand in Asia.

‘Some are even buying Mulberry hand-crafted handbags as an investment, seeing them as a safe haven similar to gold.’
