Rio Ferdinand’s retirement at the end of the season looks all the more likely, with the top football pundit role on BT Sport waiting for him.

The 35-year-old, who is on a one-year contract at Manchester United with the option for another season, is not expected to make up his mind about his playing future until much nearer the end of the current campaign

But BT Sport bosses make no secret of the fact that their main football analyst seat is being kept warm for Ferdinand, who is already under contract to the station for a variety of programming.

Career change: Rio Ferdinand is being used sparingly by David Moyes but is in demand as a pundit

Critique: Ferdinand recently spoke out against Moyes' policy of delaying his team announcements

And the word is that the former England captain will prefer this high-profile media opportunity to fighting for his place in the United team or a final payday abroad.

Ferdinand is being used more sparingly by manager David Moyes, whom Ferdinand noticeably criticised on a recent BT video diary for driving United players mad by delaying his team selections.

He claimed the United squad are wasting nervous energy wondering whether they were going to be picked and intensity levels suffers as a consequence. ‘You’re just going round in circles in your head and turning into a madman,’ he said.

Ferdinand has already committed to going to the World Cup as a BBC pundit, with BT Sport having no objections to him further learning the trade with another station. BT’s pundit line-up this season has suffered in comparison with those of Sky, ITV and the BBC and is need of a revamp.

Leeds managing director David Haigh, who is heading a consortium in the process of agreeing a 70 per cent purchase of the club from Dubai-based owners GFH Capital, looks to have found wealthy backers to help fund a January transfer spree.

One of Haigh’s partners will be insurance tycoon Andrew Flowers, whose Gibraltar-based Enterprise firm sponsor Leeds’ shirts and is valued at around £100million.

American TV network NBC have embraced Premier League football in their first season of coverage to the extent that in the 12 days between December 21 and January 1 they will broadcast 40 live games across their outlets.

This includes the BBC’s Gary Lineker, who also works for NBC, hosting an hour-long live  preview of Arsenal v Chelsea next Monday.

Wembley's main sponsorship deal with mobile phone network giants EE, which has been well over a year in negotiation, will finally be signed off at the start of the new year.

It will see the stadium arch lit up in the EE brand colours of teal and yellow on certain occasions.

The FA have made an important signing off the pitch by attracting Tony Conniford, assistant director of the UK football policing unit, to become head of security for all England teams.

Conniford, who was awarded the MBE two years ago, has worked at numerous big football  tournaments abroard and has all the experience necessary for the job.

His first priority when he starts next month will be preparing for England’s World Cup campaign. He replaces Ray Whitworth, who is joining Major League Soccer.

Conniford will no doubt be judging England’s proposed base for their pre-World Cup warm-up in the Brickell financial district of Miami. The area is a 15-minute car ride from the famous South Beach party spots.

Meanwhile the FA, after the humiliation of attracting only one outside vote at the 2018 World Cup election debacle in 2010 are finally prepared to dip their toes back into bidding for FIFA  competitions.

Relations with FIFA have improved to the extent that the FA enquired about the possibilities of staging the Under 20 World Cup in 2017 but were told that the rotation agreement among confederations meant the tournament would be held in South Korea.

Greg Dyke said yesterday about his gaffe-prone time as FA chairman that ‘You can have a straight-laced suit, or you can have someone like me.’

But certainly a sober suit would not have left respected Kick it Out chairman Lord Herman Ouseley waiting eight weeks for an official reply to his letter to Dyke complaining about ‘injudicious’ remarks made by Danny Mills in his role as a member of the England Commission panel.
