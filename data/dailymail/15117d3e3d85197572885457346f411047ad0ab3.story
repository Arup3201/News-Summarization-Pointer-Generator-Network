The lawyer who represented the Bali Nine ringleaders when they were first sentenced to death row is putting his job on the line by claiming he has new evidence that could save the condemned pair's lives. 

In an extraordinary twist, Muhammad Rifan says he has 'never revealed evidence' that could discredit him but he was prepared to ' take the heat' for the Australian drug smugglers, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, who are expected to face the firing squad by the end of the month.

Their former lawyer told reporters on Saturday after meeting with the two prisoners in Bali's Kerobokan jail that there was still time before the execution to lodge another appeal to spare the pair, The Sydney Morning Herald reported.

'It's something that implicates us, it could discredit me. But for them I will take it. I told Myuran it's okay,' he said. 'It's one last thing I can do for them.'

Mr Rifan said he went over the case history with Sukumaran for more than an hour in an effort to work out how he could team with the pair's current lawyers on a last-minute legal strategy.

He said that he felt very sad about their predicament, claiming the initial trial in 2006 had been infected by 'legal interests and political interests'. 

'At that time they were going to be sentenced to life, but there were factors which saw them sentenced to death,' he said. 'We saw intervention that time.'

'Those judges, I believe they were very sorry because after sentencing them to death, they told me that was not want they wanted.

'This highlights the problems that time, between the Indonesian government and the Australian government.

'I see at that time, the judges were not independent in sentencing the case.'

Mr Rifan said he was witness to the efforts Chan and Sukumaran had made to change themselves and other prisoners for the better.

'They don't deserve to be punished with death,' he said. 'They were foolish boys who didn't think far ahead.

'This is different to the masterminds who were controlling it.'

The lawyer said he didn't yet know what form a new legal push would take, but he was willing to try.

Likewise, he urged Australia to continue diplomatic efforts for the Sydney men 'until the last minute'.

This comes just two days before Sukumaran's mother and sister tearfully pleaded for him to be spared after they received official word he and Andrew Chan will be executed this month.

It comes after the Australian drug smugglers had their second bid for clemency officially rejected on Wednesday, dashing their final hope of avoiding the firing squad.

For two weeks, the families of Sukumaran and his co-ringleader in the 2005 Bali Nine plot, Chan, have walked silently in and out of Kerobokan jail for twice-daily visiting hours.

Australia's consul-general Majel Hind brought confirmation from Indonesian authorities on Friday that the execution will be carried out within three weeks.

Sukumaran's mother Raji, brother Chintu and sister Brintha left the prison feeling distraught as they spoke with reporters waiting outside.

Mrs Sukumaran pleaded for President Joko Widodo to spare her son and Chan.

'Please don't kill them, they are good children,' she said.

Brintha cried as she begged for her older brother's life.

'Please don't kill my brother, please,' she said.

'He's rehabilitated and we love him so much.

'Please don't kill him, please. Please.'

Brintha said her brother was doing everything possible to help people from behind bars.

'No one is listening to us, it's not fair,' she said.

'We don't have much time and he's scared. I can see it in his eyes, he's so scared.'

Earlier, expatriate Lizzie Love, who assists in Sukumaran's art classes, left the prison with one of his self-portraits and a portrait of a prisoner named Maria to be donated to charity.

The Filipina is ill and Sukumaran's paintings are funding her long-needed surgery.

Ms Love said it was one in a long line of kind acts for his fellow inmates.

'I just implore the president to please consider his position,' she said.

Mr Joko is refusing clemency to death row drug offenders regardless of their rehabilitation efforts.

An application for a judicial review that would have canvassed Chan's chaplaincy efforts and Sukumaran's successful art school - as well as past errors of law - was rejected this week.

But some of the inmates touched by the Sydney men have written their own appeals to Mr Joko.

One of them, Richo Richardo, said Chan was a selfless man who had insisted on paying for his medical care when he had no money.

'If your honour Bapak President still insists on executing Andrew Chan, I, Richo Richardo, as an Indonesian citizen, am ready to replace Andrew Chan to be executed.'

Indonesia's attorney-general is waiting for more prisoners on death row to be informed their request for clemency has been denied before setting an execution date.

There are already eight drug offenders in line for execution and he says he is waiting for 'more than three' others.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has promised to leave 'no stone unturned' in efforts to seek a stay of execution.

But on Friday, he appeared to be dampening hopes.
