Few situations are more dangerous or terrifying than getting stuck on a level crossing as a train hurtles towards you.

But as these astonishing images show, drivers and pedestrians risk their lives every day with a casual attitude to the dangers provided by a busy level crossing.

With an astonishing disregard for safety, people run across the tracks as the lights flash and bells sound, while drivers see the lowering barriers and put their foot down, rather than stop.

Dangerous: Pedestrians risk their lives running under closing barriers at Narborough level crossing in Leicestershire

A car whose driver thought he would make it is stuck on the crossing as there's no room on the other sideÂ 

Network Rail has put together footage of people risking their lives at one of the most troublesome crossings in Britain, where people take their chances against a speeding train every day of the week.

Narborough level crossing in Leicestershire is one of the worst in the country for people running stop signals.

As this jaw-dropping video footage shows, drivers there speed through lowering safety barriers while those on foot simply run and duck under the barriers as they close.

Network Rail has publicised its footage of such incidents to highlight the problems and risks of taking a chance at a level crossing.

In the past five years, there have been 60 cases of misuse of the crossing, 20 of which led to prosecutions.

The footage shows a driver getting out of his van when the level crossing barriers come down on top of his vehicle as he belatedly tries to back away.

It also highlights reckless pedestrians running across the tracks, cutting through the gap between the barriers or dodging them as they come down.

As the barrier goes down, it picks up some junk from the rear of the van, so the driver stops and jumps out

Liz Ready, community safety manager for Network Rail, said: 'Narborough crossing is renowned for serious cases of misuse.

'We hope that by engaging with motorists and pedestrians we will be able to help them use the crossing correctly.

'We take level crossing safety very seriously.'
