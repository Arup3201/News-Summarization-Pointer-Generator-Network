Charges: Justin Ross Harris, pictured in court earlier this year, has been indicted on eight counts

Justin Ross Harris, the Georgia dad who left his 22-month-old son to die in his hot car earlier this summer, has been charged with the boy's murder.

If convicted, 33-year-old Harris faces a mandatory life sentence and possibly the death penalty.

A Cobb County grand jury indicted him on eight counts including malice murder - which states that he left his son behind 'with malice aforethought' - and two counts of felony murder on Thursday morning.

He also faces counts of cruelty to children in the 1st degree, cruelty to children in the 2nd degree, criminal attempt to commit felony exploitation of children, and two counts of dissemination of harmful material to minors.

The charges of criminal attempt to commit a felony and dissemination of harmful materials  are not related  to Cooper's death - rather, they refer to allegations that Harris sexted underage girls.

Harris pleaded not guilty to murder and child cruelty charges in mid-June, but these charges filed in a grand jury indictment supersede the previous charges.

More information will become available about the latest charges at a 3pm press conference.

Harris was arrested after his son Cooper was found dead in the back seat of his hot car, which was parked outside the Home Depot where he worked on June 18.

Indicted: Harris has been charged with malice murder for the death of his 22-month-old son Cooper, pictured, who died after Harris left him in his hot car in June. As the boy died, he sexted numerous women

Found: Temperatures soared to the high 80s as Cooper was left to die in the SUV, pictured, on June 18

Police  said the toddler was left in a vehicle for about seven hours as temperatures in the Atlanta area soared into the high 80s. The medical examiner's office has said the boy died of hyperthermia - essentially overheating - and has called his death a homicide.

During subsequent investigations, it emerged that Harris had sexted as many as six women while Cooper died. He even texted one 16-year-old girl an image of his erect penis, documents reveal. 

The latest indictment refers to these allegations, accusing Harris of requesting a nude photo of a minor's genitalia and sending the same girl descriptions of 'sexual excitement and sexual conduct'.

In mid-June Harris pleaded not guilty to charges of felony murder and second-degree child cruelty, claiming he had simply forgotten to drop his son off at daycare that morning. 

Staying silent: Harris' wife, Leanna, appears in court for her husband's bond hearing earlier this summer

At the time, Cobb County Chief Magistrate Frank Cox signed off on the charges, saying Harris must have noticed that 'the stench in the car was overwhelming' when he got in it and 'drove it for some instance' before stopping to check on his son. 

Prosecutors have claimed that Harris, an unfaithful husband to wife Leanna, had wanted a life without children - even looking at website advocating a child-free lifestyle before the death.

Investigations found he had also researched online how long it takes to die in a hot car.

Another allegation was that Harris had taken  his son's new forward-facing  seat out of the car and switched it for an old rear-facing one before his death. If Cooper had been in a forward-facing seat, there would be more chance of Harris seeing the toddler when he got out of the car.

During a three-hour hearing in July, prosecutor Chuck Boring questioned a police detective at length, outlining evidence he said proved that Harris intentionally left his young boy in the hot SUV.

But defense attorney Maddox Kilgore argued that the evidence was insufficient and that the boy's death was a tragic accident. 

Harris is a native of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and moved to Georgia in 2012 to work for Home Depot.
