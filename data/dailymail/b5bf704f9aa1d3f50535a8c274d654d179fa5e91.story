A 1981 Foreign Office memo which planned for Rudolf Hess’s death referred to ‘packing his body in ice’ and ‘restraining’ the Russians if necessary by the use of British troops

Margaret Thatcher was ready to use British troops against the Russians in a fight for the corpse of Adolf Hitler’s deputy Rudolf Hess.

Foreign Office files obtained by The Mail on Sunday show that Mrs Thatcher’s Government was prepared to risk a ‘frightening’ Cold War showdown in order to ensure the Nazi war criminal’s body was returned to his family after his death.

A 1981 Foreign Office memo which planned for Hess’s death referred to ‘packing his body in ice’ and ‘restraining’ the Russians if necessary by the use of British troops.

At the time, 87-year-old Hess was the sole inmate in West Berlin’s Spandau Prison, a prisoner of the British, Russians, French and Americans, who took monthly turns to guard him.

Hess had been captured by the British in 1941 after he single-handedly flew to Scotland in a bid to strike an unauthorised peace deal with Winston Churchill’s wartime government.

He was sent to Spandau in 1947 after being sentenced to life at the Nuremberg war crimes trials.

In 1981, British officials believed a clash between British and Russian troops was possible in the then divided city because they no longer supported a Kremlin plan to cremate Hess and return his ashes to his family.

Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington was convinced – despite opposition from the Americans – that Hess’s body should be returned to his family for ‘moral and legal reasons’.

The document detailed what British officials believed might happen if Hess died during a month when the prison was run by the Russians.

It stated: ‘In a Soviet month, the Russians could prevent the body being moved, using their guard troops if need be.

‘In that event, the Allies will seek to have the body placed in the prison cellars (packed with ice to delay decomposition) until the matter is resolved either by negotiation, or by a change of guard at the end of the month.

‘If the Russians try to remove the body from the prison by force, they will be restrained by a detachment of British troops.’

The same document reveals that British officials were prepared to resort to double-bluff in a bid to try to stop the Russians interfering with the transportation of the Deputy Fuhrer’s body by air from Spandau.

It states: ‘If the Russians seek to prevent the move... minimum force will be used to restrain them.

‘The possibility of Soviet harassment of the aircraft in the [air] corridors cannot be ruled out. Apart from normal confidentiality in flight planning, it may desirable to adopt diversionary tactics to make it difficult for the Russians to identify which aircraft is carrying the body.’ 

The possibility seems to have alarmed some Foreign Office officials. One wrote: ‘I doubt whether the action envisaged is realistic.’

But another unidentified official wrote: ‘I can only say that a lot of thought went into the paragraphs in question. They look frightening on paper, but I am confident that the British military can handle the Russians.’

The documents show officials in Washington urged the British to stick to an original 1970 agreement and warned a change of policy might mean ‘the need to use force’.

In the event, Hess’s suicide at the age of 93 in August 1987 meant that all plans by the four Allied powers went out of the window.

Hess, who hanged himself in the prison’s reading room, was initially buried at a secret location to avoid his grave becoming a shrine for Nazi sympathisers.

His body was re-interred at a family plot in Wunsiedel, Germany, in March 1988 and his wife llse was buried alongside him in 1995.

But in 2011, his body was exhumed and his grave destroyed precisely because it had become a Neo-Nazi pilgrimage site.

His body was cremated and his ashes scattered at sea.
