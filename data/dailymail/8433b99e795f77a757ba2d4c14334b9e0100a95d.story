Fernando Torres can return to his brilliant best under the guidance of Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone, according to former England boss Fabio Capello.

Torres has not been in form in front of goal since joining Chelsea for £50million four years ago, but Capello believes he can rediscover his deadly touch under Simeone.

The Spain striker captained his home-town club Atletico as a teenager, when Simeone was one of his team-mates, and is hoping returning to the place where he made his name will help bring back the knack of goalscoring.

And Capello believes Simeone can provide the boost to Torres' confidence, as well as tactical coaching, that will lift the 30-year-old out of his slump.

'Torres has got it all, but has lost his way a bit and is struggling to score goals,' Capello told Spanish paper Marca at the Globe Soccer Conference in Dubai. 

'He has lost the confidence he had at Liverpool and during his first stint at Atletico. 

'Simeone is going to make Torres come good. It is not only to do with systems: it is a confidence thing. 

'Torres has become a bit subdued but is going to rediscover what he has lost thanks to Cholo (Simeone's nickname), who is going to reinvigorate him.'
