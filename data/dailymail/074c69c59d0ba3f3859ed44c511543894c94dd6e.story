It looks like Game Of Thrones. It sounds like Game Of Thrones. But as the camera sweeps across the map, it soon becomes clear that this short film has re-imagined the TV fantasy series to deliver a very modern political message.

Titled Game Of Cuts (Winter Is Coming For Councils), it was produced by a campaign group which is calling for fairer funding and fewer cuts for the councils it represents - 45 urban authorities in northern, midland and south-coast regions of England.

The production, which cost £11,000, cleverly echoes the drama played out in the hit HBO show.

Game Of Thrones spoof Game Of Cuts was produced by campaign group Sigoma, which is calling for fairer funding and fewer cuts for the councils it represents - 45 urban authorities in northern, midland and south-coast regions of England

Made by Sigoma (Special Interest Group of Municipal Authorities), it depicts a fictional kingdom where funding cuts have meant some regions cannot fund vital services, while other areas moan about not having luxuries. 

In the opening scene are characters based on those from the House of Lannister - a rich and powerful dynasty in the south.

Among them is a parody of King Joffrey Baratheon, a ruthless ruler, who is informed: 'The seven kingdoms prosper once more. 

'We must not jeopardise this by pandering to the whims of the north... Our funding cuts will help to protect the future of the seven kingdoms.'

Honourable northerner Lord Ned Starp (played in the actual series by Sean Bean as Ned Stark) is seen right, in the foreground. He says to the evil King Joffrey of the south (left: 'Your grace, what is the meaning of this? The people of the northern cities are already on their knees! Our old and the sick have no one to care for them'

In the film, Queen Cersei is seen reinforcing the claims made by her son Joffrey

Enter honourable northerner Lord Ned Starp (played in the actual series by Sean Bean as Ned Stark): 'Your grace, what is the meaning of this? The people of the northern cities are already on their knees! Our old and the sick have no one to care for them.'

'Our children have no places to read and our roads are crumbling.'

But at every turn, Starp's entreaties are scoffed at. 

To join Sigoma, council must pay an initial fee of £3,000.

However, the film has been criticised by Conservative party vice-chairman and former local government minister Bob Neill.

He said: 'Taxpayers' money shouldn't be used to subsidise the Box Set fantasies of town hall officials. 

At the end of the short film, the king fires an arrow at Lord Starp, whose pleas for more funding in the north are scoffed at 

According to Sigoma, by March 2016, the amount of funding cuts for regions will be:

'It's a complete waste of money, but also a complete fiction. It's missing the key plot - there's a black hole in the Kingdom's coffers, thanks to the bad old days of King Gordon. 

'His hand of the king, Baron Red Ed, may now eye the throne, but he would wind the clock back to same failed old policies of government waste and higher taxes, meaning less money to go around for local services.' 

Meanwhile, Labour councillor Sir Steve Houghton, chairman of Sigoma said: 'Whilst councils have made every effort to absorb the funding cuts and adapt, the successive rounds of cuts mean that councils are rapidly running out of options for making the savings required.

'Clearly a situation in which some councils are struggling to provide essential services such as care and support for their most vulnerable residents, whilst others have more than enough, is clearly unfair and unsustainable,' he told the Express And Star.

He added that the reason the video was made was because national politicians were not listening. 

According to Sigoma, since 2010, local government in England has lost more than 40 per cent of its core funding.

It also said that urban authorities, largely in the North and the Midlands, have lost the most money as a result of these cuts.
