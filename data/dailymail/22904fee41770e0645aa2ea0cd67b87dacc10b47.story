A Google Street View user called the police after spotting an apparent murder while they were browsing the popular website.

The site is infamous for capturing couples in flagrante and prostitutes working the streets.

But one user thought they had come across a serious crime when they came across a man appearing to stand over his lifeless victim.

Jokes: A scene on a street in Edinburgh where jokers Dan Thompson (on 
the ground), 56, and Garry Kerr (with axe handle), 31, were caught on 
Street View pretending to commit a murder

Pranksters: Concerned by what they had seen, one person called police to report a murder in Leith, Edinburgh

Concerned by what they had seen, the person called the police to report a murder in Leith, Edinburgh.

But the two men in the shot were actually a pair of mischievous mechanics.

Dan Thomson, 56, and Gary Kerr, 31, staged the fake murder as a joke when Google’s camera car passed by their garage on Giles Street.

Mr Thomson, the garage boss who posed as a murder victim, said: 'I recognised the Google car coming into the street from the camera tower on the top. We just thought we had to do something.

'This opportunity wasn’t coming around very often so Gary grabbed a pick axe handle and we ran out into the street.

'Giles Street is in a U-shape so we 
had about a minute before it would pass us. It had to go around a car 
park to take various shots so that gave us some time.

'We decided really quickly what to do and I lay down while Gary stood over me with a pick axe handle.'

He
 added: 'It was all we could think of in the few seconds we had. It was 
just devilment. We work on a backstreet in Leith - anything to liven up 
the day.'

The pranksters 
staged the fake murder last summer and almost forgot about it as several
 months passed before the footage went online.

Mr Thomson
 first heard from friends and family - including his son - who had 
spotted the scene, but was mortified when real police came to the garage
 to investigate reports of his death.

Mr Thomson said: 'It was a guy from one of our local parts supply companies who called us up and said he had seen us on Street View.

'But then someone else must have looked at it and thought it was a real attack and called the police.

'Then two of Lothian and Borders finest turn up with a report of a man being massacred outside a garage.

'Murder': The prank was carried out on Giles Street, Edinburgh and the pair had just a minute to prepare

'They said it was hilarious and away they went.'

Police officers, entertained by their gag, left Thomson’s Motor Company satisfied they had cracked the case.

Mechanic Mr Kerr, who posed as the axe-wielding maniac, added: 'I had seen various stunts that people pulled on Street View in the paper so we thought this was our chance.

'It was all Dan’s thinking. He was the mastermind.'

He added that luckily one of the police officers knew them as they often fix their vehicles and were just following up procedure.

He said: 'The police had a joke - they knew it was a prank.'

The pair say they are fully prepared to create a top secret 'tableau' when the Google Street car next makes its way past - although when it made a surprise visit the other day they completely missed it.

Mr Thomson said: 'Last Wednesday or Thursday by chance the car went past. We weren’t ready.'

Launched in 2007, Google Street View provides panoramic views of streets and roads after being captured by Google’s car mounted cameras.

Anyone caught on camera has their faces blurred due to privacy concerns.

Pranksters from all over the world have managed to get their own staged scenes onto the database, while others have been caught unsuspectingly by the Google car.

Famous images captured include a man picking his nose while driving his car and a pair of snorkellers wandering down a street.

The website has even caught a marriage proposal on camera.

A police spokeswoman said officers treated all reports of suspected crime seriously.

She said: 'Anyone with any concerns, or who would like to report a crime, should contact police on 101.'

The latest picture of the set-up murder scene joins a list of unusual sights captured on Google Street View.

One of the most famous, from Norway, shows two men dressed in full scuba gear chasing a Google car down the road brandishing a harpoon.

The duo are spotted waiting patiently on lawn chairs until the car passes them in Bergen, Norway, when they get up and chase after it while waving a harpoon in the air.

In another, which somewhat echoes the most recent prank, a schoolgirl ‘played dead’ in the street while the Google car drove past her.

Anxious residents browsing their on-screen neighbourhood contacted Google about the image fearing they had chanced on a murder scene.

But it turned out the 'body' belonged to ten-year-old Azura Beebeejaun who revealed she was 'playing dead' as a prank outside her home in Middle Road, Worcester.

And in another prank, two men were caught Samurai fighting on a patch of scrubland in Pittsburgh, U.S.

The pair were wearing home-made versions of the traditional armour and brandishing what look like baseball bats instead of katana blades.

However, Google decided to blur the duo out after being made aware of the Street View image at '8 Sampsonia Way, Pittsburgh, Allegheny, Pennsylvania'.
