Footage of Syria's brutal dictator and his wife packing up food parcels has been broadcast on state TV - after they were derided for ordering luxury goods on the internet while their country burns.    

Pictures were broadcast last night showing Bashar and Asma Assad receiving a rapturous welcome at al-Fahya stadium in Damascus.    

They joined hundreds of volunteers boxing cartons full of flour, sugar, cooking oil and pasta for victims of fighting in Homs, where the president's forces are crushing an uprising.

All smiles: Bashar and Asma Assad were shown packing up food boxes in a Damascus stadium

Ridiculous: The pair shook hands and grinned as they 'helped' in the footage broadcast on state TV

Helping out: They have been slammed for ordering luxury goods on the internet while their country burns

The Assads have long worked to manage their image, but it backfired a year ago when a glamorous photo shoot and gushing profile of Asma, 36, appeared in Vogue magazine just as her husband launched a violent crackdown on pro-democracy protests.    

Those images are now part of a YouTube campaign led by the wives of United Nations ambassadors from Britain and Germany, which alternates stylish shots of Asma with gruesome pictures of dead and injured Syrian children.   

For her latest TV appearance Asma avoided any hint of glamour, dressing down in a sheer pink sweater over a simple dress with her dark blonde hair soberly braided and pinned up.    

Her tall, gangly husband looked relaxed, towering above his admirers in a polo shirt with an identity pass on a ribbon around his neck like other volunteers.

Emergence of the footage came as Syria was slammed by the United Nations for failing to keep to the terms of a peace plan and continuing to station troops and heavy weapons in towns.

In a letter to the Security Council UN chief Ban Ki-moon said Syria was failing to send a 'clear signal' about its commitment to peace, underlining Western fears for the week-old truce.     

Despite these fears, the UN today signed an agreement on the terms of a future ceasefire monitoring mission, the Syrian Foreign Ministry said. It could see up to 300 observers entering the country.

UN-Arab League mediator Kofi Annan said the Syrian government and the UN had agreed a basis for a 'protocol' on the deployment of more monitors.

'This agreement outlines the functions of the observers as they fulfil their mandate in Syria and the tasks and responsibilities of the Syrian government,' Ahmad Fawzi, Annan's spokesman, said in a statement.

Fawzi said Annan's team was holding 'similar discussions with representatives of the opposition on the tasks and responsibilities of the armed opposition groups.'

A survey by the United Nations has found that the number of civilians uprooted inside Syria has jumped by 
some 230,000 since the start of the uprising last year.

A
report by the Norwegian Refugees Council and the Geneva-based Internal 
Displacement Monitoring Centre says more than 600,000 people are now 
internally displaced inside Syria, including some 400,000 from the 
country's 1967 war with Israel.

Tens
of thousands more have fled to neighbouring countries, making them 
officially refugees. The increase makes Syria the country with the 
eighth highest number of internally displaced people in the world.

Colombia
has the highest number of these refugees, with up to 5.2 million 
displaced, followed by Iraq, Sudan, Congo and Somalia.

The 15-member U.N. Security Council will meet at 1pm GMT today for a briefing by Annan's deputy, Jean-Marie Guehenno.

It is seen as crucial in determining whether the conditions are right for deploying a larger monitoring mission to Syria.     

U.S. and European diplomats on the council have suggested that Syria's lack of full compliance with its obligations to end the violence may make it difficult for them to support a new resolution that would be needed to deploy an expanded observer mission.    

In the first progress report since the Security Council passed a resolution on Saturday authorising the deployment of observers.

Secretary-General Ban proposed an expanded mission of 300 personnel to monitor a shaky ceasefire between forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and opposition fighters.

Ban said this week that 250 observers were too few in a country of 23million where the United Nations says at least 9,000 people have been killed in the past 13 months.

He sought European help in supplying planes and helicopters. But Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said 250 was a 'reasonable number'.

But he added that they should be from countries such as China, Russia, Brazil, India and South Africa - all more sympathetic to Damascus than are the West or the Arab League.

He also dismissed any need for UN aircraft.

The monitors' mission, however, will be a perilous one. Yesterday gunfire and protests broke out near a team of UN observers.

Shooting erupted close to an advance party of military personnel from the UN who had been swarmed by protesters denouncing Assad in the town of Erbin, on the northeastern outskirts of the capital Damascus.    

There were no reports of casualties. But scenes of monitors' vehicles stuck in a crowd and men running away while gunfire rattled in the air were an ominous echo of an earlier monitoring mission, by the Arab League, which collapsed in January.    

The U.S. said the incident - and sustained shelling by the Syrian army of the city of Homs - raised questions about whether observers could actually monitor any truce.
