A Louisiana babysitter has been arrested and the 5-week-old boy she's accused of kidnapping is back with his family after they both went missing Friday.

Louisiana State Police apprehended 48-year-old babysitter Sarah Harris of Violet on Sunday on charges she kidnapped Tristan Cayden Douglas.

New Orleans police said Tristan's mother told them Friday that Harris never returned home after saying she was driving to a convenience store in New Orleans.

Never returned: Police say Harris vanished with the baby on Friday after telling the mother she was taking him to a grocery store

The mother Takisha Douglas had dropped her son off at Harris's home while she went to work on Friday.

She says she called Harris while at work and the babysitter said she was taking the boy to a New Orleans grocery store.

Douglas says she called again after getting off work and Harris's phone went to voicemail, reports the New Orleans Times-Picayune.

Authorities had since issued an endangered-missing child advisory for the boy.

Why'd she do it? Harris was found walking along an eastern New Orleans street around 7:30am Sunday morning with the infant. It remained unclear Sunday afternoon what her alleged intentions were

Douglas had reportedly known Harris for years but that this was the first time she'd looked after her child.

St. Bernard Sheriff Jimmy Pohlmann told the Times-Picayune that local authorities worked with the FBI leading up to the arrest.

Pohlmann said Harris was found walking along an eastern New Orleans street around 7:30am Sunday morning with the infant.

'This was a great outcome, the best it could have been,' Pohlmann said in a statement. 'The longer something like this goes on, the less likely the chance is for a good outcome.'
