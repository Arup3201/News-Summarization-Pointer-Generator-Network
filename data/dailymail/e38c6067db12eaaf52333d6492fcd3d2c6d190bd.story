Prime Minister Julia Gillard’s partner - popularly known as the country’s ‘First Bloke’ - has landed himself in hot water over a jokey comment he made while giving a lecture about prostate cancer.

Tim Mathieson told members of the West Indian cricket team at the Prime Minister’s home,  The Lodge,  in Canberra that when being tested for the disease the best way was to ‘look for a small female Asian doctor’.

He was suggesting that because the physical test involved a finger check a smaller hand would be more comfortable.

‘We can get a blood test for it but the digital examination is the only true way to get a correct reading on your prostate so make sure you go and do that and perhaps look for a small Asian female doctor is probably the best way,’ he said to chuckles among the team.

But one person was definitely not amused - Miss Gillard,  who was present and who refused to join in the mirth.

And today,  a few hours after the remark, Miss Gillard admitted that Mr Mathieson’s comments were in poor taste.

After he had apologised, Miss Gillard said he had done the right thing to say he was sorry – but defended his commitment to men’s health causes.

‘He did his best to persuade notoriously reluctant men to get health checks,’ said Miss Gillard, who had simply stared at him from behind his back as he made what he thought was an amusing statement.

‘It’s important to get that message across’ she told ABC radio.

‘Obviously, there’s various ways of getting that message across but he’ s certainly acknowledged that the joke cracked last night was in poor taste.’

Mr Mathieson, 55, a real estate agent and former hairdresser who has been Miss Gillard’s partner since 2006, said today that his remarks were aimed at raising awareness about prostate cancer and the need for men to get regular checks.

A supporter of the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia and a volunteer ambassador for the Australian Men’s Shed Association – a male support group - Mr Mathieson admitted today that he had got it wrong.

‘It was meant as a joke and on reflection I accept it was in poor taste,’ he said in a brief statement issued by the Prime Minister’s office.

‘I apologise for any offence caused’

Shadow attorney general George Brandis said Mr Mathieson was lucky he didn’t tell his joke after an anti-discrimination bill – currently before parliament - became law.

‘If he did, he’d probably have been carted away to the re-education camp by the thought police,’ Senator Brandis told Sky News, adding that the joke was in poor taste.

Radio host Ray Hadley said it was ironic that Mr Mathieson should have made a comment that would be offensive to Asian women after Miss Gillard had last year accused the leader of the Liberal opposition, Tony Abbott, of being a misogynist.

The couple, who have been together since 2006, met Prince William at the Royal Wedding in 2011

Mr Mike Kelly, Labour’s parliamentary secretary, said that while Mr Mathieson had been a tireless promoter of men’s health issues, the joke would have been better left unsaid.

‘It’s a poor choice of words,’ he told Sky News.

Social media commentators were divided over whether the comment was tasteless.

Cheryl Critchley wrote on Twitter that ‘Tim Mathieson’s comment was dumb but at least it’s got everyone talking about prostate exams.’

Another commentator wrote: ‘I’m offended by Tim Mathieson’s allegedly sexist/racist joke. Time to take him to a Gillard-approved kangaroo court?’

A supporter of Mr Matthieson’s comment wrote that it was ‘not offensive at all, and if it makes just one bloke book a prostate exam, then the exercise has been worthwhile.’
