Media pressure group Hacked Off made extraordinary threats against Labour in a bid to ‘sabotage’ cross-party talks on Press reform, it emerged last night.

The group threatened to publish a statement in which victims of phone hacking would condemn Ed Miliband, Harriet Harman and Nick Clegg in the strongest terms for agreeing to a ‘dirty deal’.

The statement even suggested that David Cameron’s plans would make the Queen complicit in a ‘stitch-up’.

The Hacked Off campaign attempted to blackmail labour leader Ed Miliband while he was in talks about press regulation

The revelations came as the Coalition parties published rival plans for Press reform, which MPs will now vote on in a showdown in the Commons on Monday night.

All three main parties will order their MPs to fall into line on Monday. 

But Labour sources said they were in talks with a group of about 20 Tory rebels who may be persuaded to defy Mr Cameron. 

A small group of Labour MPs could also rebel, but most Westminster observers believe the Parliamentary arithmetic is narrowly against the Prime Minister at this stage. A draft press release was shown to senior Labour figures on Tuesday – just 24 hours after the three party leaders had been on the verge of a deal on bringing in a tough new system of Press regulation by Royal Charter.

Sources close to the talks said Mr Miliband then tabled 20 new demands the following day, making a deal ‘unworkable’.

A Tory source said: ‘It sabotaged the talks – it became impossible, because Labour were taking dictation from Hacked Off. Miliband came back with 20 further demands which were not there and which scuppered the whole thing. They have no principled position on this.’ 

Hacked Off’s draft press release included a statement signed by the parents of Milly Dowler, the parents of Madeleine McCann, Hugh Grant and a number of other phone hacking victims, in which they accused the Labour and Lib Dem  leadership of doing a ‘dirty deal’.

Hacked Off initially denied threatening Labour with a draft press release when it was put to them by the Daily Mail on Thursday night.

But yesterday a spokesman acknowledged the existence of the statement and did not deny using it to pile pressure on Labour. A spokesman said: ‘This draft press release was written as a worst case scenario and was never formally sent to the media. We had to be prepared for every eventuality.’ 

Labour insisted it had not changed its position as a result of the intense lobbying by Hacked Off. A source said the fresh demands tabled by Mr Miliband had already been raised ‘many times’ with officials.

Monday’s vote will be a critical 
moment in the history of Press freedom – with critics warning Britain’s 
tradition of free speech is at risk. Dragons’ Den star Theo Paphitis 
told BBC Question Time: ‘The last thing we want is for politicians to be
able to control the Press. We need to have a free Press.’ 

The
Conservatives released proposals for a Press regulator governed by 
Royal Charter which would impose what the Prime Minister described as 
‘the toughest regulation of the Press that this country has ever seen’.

An hour later, Mr Miliband and Mr Clegg published their own plans, which would also use a Royal Charter to establish a regulator but would be underpinned by legislation – seen by critics as the thin end of the wedge in allowing politicians to interfere with the Press.

They would also remove control from editors of the newspaper code of practice. Industry sources last night said the issue was a ‘red line’ which would see newspapers refuse to sign up to the deal.

In other respects the proposals represent a climbdown by Mr Miliband, who initially backed Lord Justice Leveson’s call for media regulator Ofcom to oversee a new Press regulator whose role would be ‘set out in statute’. The retreat will fuel suspicions that the Labour leader has been playing to the gallery by calling for the full implementation of Lord Justice Leveson’s plans in public, while privately conceding they were unworkable.

A Tory source last night said the Prime Minister’s decision to pull the plug on cross party talks had ‘flushed out’ Mr Miliband. Mr Clegg said he was still hopeful a last-minute deal could be reached.
