A father has spoken of his devastation after his son was struck down with deadly blood poisoning while on a trip of a lifetime. 

Now the Adelaide family are being forced to find hundreds of thousands of dollars to fund his medical treatment in Mexico. 

Ryan Maudlen was travelling through Playa del Carmen, south of Cancun, with his girlfriend Katharina Reigl, 29, when he suddenly became ill last week.

Ryan Maudlen, 33, from Adelaide, is fighting for his life in a Mexican hospital 

The 33-year-old, who suffers from Crohn’s disease, is now in a medically induced coma in hospital in Cancun after being diagnosed with septicaemia and perforated intestines.  

Mr Maudlen had to have emergency surgery and have 60cm of his bowel removed after he was hospitalised, he is now at Galenia Hospital, in Cancun, where his girlfriend and mum Deb, 60, are at his bedside. 

Mr Maudlen's dad Robert, 64, speaking from the family home in Modbury Heights told Daily Mail Australia, the family were trying to pull together despite being spread out across the globe.

He said: 'Deb left to be with Ryan on Satruday, she took our laptop and so she can call me on Skype.

'I am hearing news from my daughter Rachel who is in London and then she is letting me know the latest information. 

'Ryan had been feeling crook for a few days before he fell ill but he just kept saying 'I will be fine; and then it all happened. 

'This has come out of the blue for all of us, Ryan was home with us in 2012 when he saw his specialist and they said everything with his Crohn’s disease was good.

'This took us all by complete surprise, the doctors said that living overseas must have been good for him.'  

Mr Maudlen, who has been with his partner for three and a half years, collapsed last Wednesday in Playa del Carmen, south of Cancun on the east coast, and his partner rushed him by ambulance to the nearest hospital. 

After two days in a local hospital he was sent up to a bigger hospital which has more facilities, he is in an isolation unit. 

The medical bills for the around-the-clock care have already reached $100,000 and are expected to go above $200,000. 

Mr Maudlen's mum, who works as a legal secretary, has travelled to Mexico to spend nine days with her son. 

The family have already visited the bank to find out if they can re-mortgage their family home, they are visiting the bank again today to find out the outcome of their application.

Mr Maudlen's Austrian girlfriend Katharina Reigl has at his bedside 24/7 since last week

While his wife is in Mexico, the devastated father-of-three is trying to see what money he can get together each day and they are maxing out credit cards. 

The baker told Daily Mail Australia: 'The cost for the round-the-clock care is $13,500 a day, I am just all over the place at the moment.

'I can’t believe the charges, when he was admitted, Katty had to find $15,000 straight away. 

'We are devastated, we never ever expected it to happen, we always thought he might have problems but over the past two years he has been so good and not needed medication.' 

Mr Maudlen's father explained his son and girlfriend were supposed to carry on their travels after going through Mexico.

Katharina spoke to 9News about her boyfriend's plight and asked for fundraising help

'They bought an old Toyota and they went to Alaska and back down through Canada into the US and then onto Mexico. 

'They were supposed to go to Panama and through the eastern side to the bottom of Argentina.' he said. 

The last time Mr Maudlen had problems with his Crohn’s disease was when he was 18. 

'When he was young the doctors thought they might have to open him up and the doctor said 'you missed another bullet you are alright', his dad said. 

Mr Maudlen has been away from Australia for eight years and has lived in London and Canada and travelled the world extensively in that time. 

A donation page has been set up for Mr Maudlen by one of his friend's in Canada. 

Donations have now reached over $46,000, they are nearly halfway to the $100,000 target.
