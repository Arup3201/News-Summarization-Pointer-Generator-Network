Arrest: Former Montgomery County DA Bruce Castor said he wanted to arrest Cosby - but there was not enough evidence

The former District Attorney who decided not to charge Bill Cosby with rape today revealed to MailOnline that he wanted to arrest the star - but had insufficient proof.

Bruce Castor was the DA of Montgomery County at the time that Andrea Constand claimed Cosby, now 77, drugged her and sexually assaulted her at his Pennsylvania home in January 2004.

Miss Constand, a former director of operations for Temple University's women's basketball team and college basketball star, launched a legal suit against Cosby, a man she called her 'mentor', in March 2005. She was the first - and only woman - to press charges against the comic legend.

And today, Mr Castor, who is now Montgomery County commissioner, told MailOnline exclusively: 'I wanted to arrest Bill Cosby because I thought he was probably guilty, but being able to prove anything beyond a reasonable doubt and thinking he's probably guilty are two different things.

'We knew back then that other woman had come forward, but even if they did it didn't mean anything for our case as none of those cases resulted in charges and were remote in time.'

Commissioner Castor, a former two-term DA of Montgomery County and a private lawyer at the Bryn Mawr law office of Rogers and Associates., added: 'The lady who was allegedly attacked waited a year before she reported it. As a result of that delay, any possible corroborating physical evidence was unavailable to us.

'We couldn't test for hairs, fibers, DNA and drugs in her system that might match those at Mr Cosby's house. We didn't have any corroborative evidence.

'There was almost no evidence on which to base a criminal case. The lady could not remember what happened with any detail, and she didn't report it for a year, all this made the case very difficult.

'I thought the failure to report the alleged incident would create a high hurdle to jump over. It was not like she could say what happened.' 

In her civil suit, Miss Constand, now 41, said she first met Cosby, a Temple University alum, in November 2002 and the pair became friends. She considered him a 'mentor' and was a frequent guest at dinner parties at his home.

However, in court papers, she claims that after arriving at Cosby's house on an evening in January 2004,  the comic legend gave her three blue pills when she said she was stressed over work, which he described as 'herbal medication' to help her relax.

Then, the suit states, her 'knees began to shake, her limbs felt immobile, she felt dizzy and weak, and she began to feel only barely conscious.'

Cosby then gave her another drug, she said, and led her to the sofa, where she says she was sexually molested.

'When Plaintiff awoke, her clothes and undergarments were in disarray,' the suit said. 

Miss Constand later returned to her native Canada, where she reported the incident to police in January 2005. Authorities in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, followed up with an investigation, but in February 2005, they declined to press criminal charges due to a lack of evidence.

Commissioner Castor said: 'All she could say is that she was there (at Cosby's house) and then something might have happened due to how she was when she next remembered something.

'I also knew she had a civil court remedy with a much lower standard of proof, and in fact, she had initiated such a case.

'So this lady was going to get a measure of justice in civil court where the burden of proof is much lower: just more likely than not that Cosby had done it. 50 per cent plus a tiny bit. A far cry from proof beyond a reasonable doubt which, essentially, is just shy of proof beyond any doubt.

As a result of the alleged incident, Miss Constand claimed she had suffered 'serious and debilitating injuries, mental anguish, humiliation, embarrassment, physical and emotional upset, including, but not limited to, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, sleeplessness, isolation, flashbacks, anxiety, the full extent of which injuries are not yet known and some or all which may be permanent in nature.'

The suit also said she had been 'caused to suffer and continues to suffer severe emotional distress, humiliation, embarrassment and financial loss.' 

Miss Constand sued Cosby for more than $150,000 in damages.

Thirteen other women were claimed to be supporting witnesses in her suit and she settled out of court for an undisclosed sum in 2006.

Today, Miss Constand declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline.

However, she seemed to make her feelings clear on the overwhelming publicity surrounding Cosby and his alleged sexual offences.

She tweeted a saying from Dr Seuss: 'My heart goes out to you:Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind.'  

Statement: Bill Cosby, pictured in April, broke his silence amid the allegations of sexual assault on his website. The post thanked fans for their 'outpouring' of support

Paid out: Bill Cosby and Andrea Constand came to an out of court settlement in 2006

When asked about the rape charges by NPR Weekend Edition host Scott Simon last week, Cosby - joined by his wife of 50-years Camille -  shook his head, wagged his finger and gave an 'impish, delightful' smile. 

A day later the comedian's lawyer called the charges 'discredited' and said the 'fact that they are being repeated does not make them true. The star would not 'dignify' the allegations with a response, he added..

'He would like to thank all his fans for the outpouring of support and assure them that, at age 77, he is doing his best work. There will be no further statement from Mr. Cosby or any of his representatives.'

However, this was later taken down and today, a joint statement from Dolores Troiani, counsel to Andrea Constand, and John P. Schmitt, counsel to Bill Cosby.statement was posted on billcosby.com saying:  'The statement released by Mr. Cosby's attorney over the weekend was not intended to refer in any way to Andrea Constand. 

'As previously reported, differences between Mr. Cosby and Ms. Constand were resolved to the mutual satisfaction of Mr. Cosby and Ms. Constand years ago. Neither Mr. Cosby nor Ms. Constand intends to comment further on the matter.'

Keeping quiet: Andrea Constand declined to comment on the latest allegations of sexual assault made by women against Bill Cosby

Support:  Andrea Constand has been posting a series of supportive messages on her Twitter feed

Joan Tarshis, a former publicist, is now the latest to accuse Cosby of rape, claiming he assaulted her on two occasions in 1969, when she was 19.

Joan wrote an essay for Hollywood Elswhere, published on Sunday, saying that she felt she could not come forward because Cosby was idolized - but said she was going public in the wake of accusations made by other women.

'I thought nobody would believe me because of his image, you know, whiter than snow,' she told The Wrap. 

Allegations: Barbara Bowman claims years of hell at the hands of Bill Cosby

And Barbara Bowman, who last month described her years of hell at the hands of the comic legend exclusively to MailOnline, is now asking him to acknowledge her claims.

She said: 'I understand why more women have not spoken up. But my plea is that ANY women sexually abused by Bill Cosby come forward now and speak out. You have an obligation to survivors. If you don't speak out, you're helping no one, including yourselves. If nothing else, don't you deserve closure yourselves? Your daughters are not immune to this if we all stay silent. What kind of message are we sending to our own children?'

'This is why I'm speaking out. Wouldn't you like your daughters to learn how to stay safe from sexual predators? That's why I'm pushing so hard.'

Cosby has never been charged with any crime relating to the allegations now swirling around him.
