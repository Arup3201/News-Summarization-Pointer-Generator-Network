Gus Poyet has snapped up his second South American of the day following Ricky Alvarez’s arrival from Inter Milan.

The Argentina winger - like Liverpool’s Uruguay defender Sebastian Coates - has penned a season-long loan deal at the Stadium of Light.

Quality: Alvarez has impressed at Inter Milan since joining in 2011, scoring 13 times for the Italian club

Permanent: Although the signing is initially a loan deal Sunderland will make it permanent if they stay up

The 26-year-old is currently on international duty but will return ahead of Spurs’ visit a week on Saturday. 

The loan fee is one million euros, while sources in Milan say Sunderland have committed to paying 11million euros for him next June, provided they remain in the Barclays Premier League.

Alvarez, who joined Inter from Velez in 2011, scored four times in 28 league appearances for the Serie A side last season.

He was part of the Argentina squad that reached the World Cup final, but played only 27 minutes during the tournament, as a substitute against Nigeria.
