They have always been seen as a nation of lovers, happy to give in to their passions and turn a blind eye to the indiscretions of others.

But the latest revelations about the sexual goings-on at the top of their political establishment have shattered the usual French sangfroid.

It emerged yesterday that the First Lady, Valerie Trierweiler, had been at the centre of an astonishing ‘menage a six’.

Miss Trierweiler, it was revealed, had
been the shared mistress of Francois Hollande, now the country’s 
Socialist president, and  a married conservative minister, Patrick 
Devedjian.

Not only that, but she was still married to her husband at the time.

And more controversially still, Mr 
Hollande was at the time living with Segolene Royal, the mother of his 
four children and a senior Socialist politician in her own right.

This is the first time that details of
47-year-old Miss Trierweiler’s passionate affair with Right-winger Mr 
Devedjian, now 68, have been made public.

She was sleeping with Mr Devedjian at the same time as seeing Left-winger Mr Hollande, now 58.

Miss Trierweiler frequently asked Mr 
Devedjian, who is still a senior member of the opposition UMP coalition,
to leave his wife of more than 30 years for her, and when he refused 
she concentrated her affections on Mr Hollande.

Victoire: Francois Hollande celebrates his election win with Valerie Trierweiler earlier this year. She has since become one of the most unpopular first ladies in recent history

Incredibly, Mr Devedjian and Mr 
Hollande both knew they were sleeping with the same mistress, and 
developed ‘a great respect for each other’.

Details of the complicated affairs are
contained in La Frondeuse (The Rebellious One), an unauthorised 
biography of Miss  Trierweiler by the French political writers 
Christophe Jakubyszyn and Alix Bouilhaguet, which comes out today.

They were also publicised across 
France yesterday, with respected newspapers  including Le Figaro and 
broadcasters carrying the story.

In an interview with French magazine 
Point Of View, Mr Jakubyszyn said Mr Devedjian and Miss Trierweiler 
enjoyed ‘an intimate relationship which lasted a number of years. At the
time, both of them were married. They hesitated in making the big jump,
to change their life.

‘Patrick Devedjian dilly-dallied so 
much that Valerie Trierweiler was left to be seduced by a second  man 
from another political side – Francois Hollande.’

Mr Jakubyszyn, who also presents a 
political programme on French television, said that ‘little by little, 
the relationship with Hollande took over the other one’.

In 2003 Miss Trierweiler gave Mr 
Devedjian ‘an ultimatum’ to leave his wife, Sophie, an army general’s 
daughter with whom he has four children. But Mr Devedjian ‘would not 
give in’ and leave Sophie,  whom he had married in 1969, said Mr 
Jakubyszyn.

Miss Trierweiler was at the time 
married to her second husband, her fellow Paris Match magazine 
journalist Denis Trierweiler, with whom she has three sons.

The Trierweiler divorce was not 
applied for until 2007, before being sealed in 2010, meaning Miss  
Trierweiler would effectively have been seeing at least three men at one
stage.

Mr Jakubyszyn said that Mr Hollande 
and Mr Devedjian – who he said ‘maintained a great respect  for each 
other’ – were at one stage general secretaries of their respective 
parties.

France's former president Nicolas Sarkozy divorced for the second time and then married Carla Bruni, the former supermodel turned pop singer who had admitted that 'monogamy bores me'

Miss Trierweiler, who was a political 
affairs reporter while sleeping with the two men, would have accordingly
been party to some intriguing pillow talk from across the political 
spectrum.

Mr Hollande did not ‘officially’ break up with Miss Royal until after she unsuccessfully ran for the presidency in 2007.

The pair regularly paraded themselves 
as a couple up until this year, but it is now clear that Mr Hollande had
taken Miss Trierweiler as a mistress many years before.

Mr Devedjian is a close personal 
friend of Nicolas Sarkozy, the conservative UMP president who was 
defeated by Mr Hollande in the May presidential election.

Since then, Miss Trierweiler – 
nicknamed ‘Valerie Rottweiler’ and ‘First Concubine’ by the French media
– has become one of the most unpopular first ladies in recent history.

In June, she sent a Twitter message 
encouraging voters to support a rival to Miss Royal in parliamentary 
elections. Miss Royal went on to lose the election and since then 
neither she, nor her four children with Mr Hollande, have spoken to Miss
Trierweiler, accusing her of a ‘stab in the back’.

The mutual loathing between Miss Royal
and Miss Trierweiler is regularly highlighted in the French media, 
especially because Mr Hollande’s live-in lover has her own office at the
grand presidential Elysee Palace, while Miss Royal does not even have a
parliamentary seat.

A lawyer for Miss Trierweiler last 
night said she was planning to sue the authors of the book for breaking 
France’s strict privacy laws, and for defamation. There was no specific 
denial of any of the allegations contained in La Frondeuse, but her 
barrister Frederique Giffard instead said that the entire book was a 
collection of ‘author assertions backed by unproven rumours’, all aimed 
at ‘maliciously tarnishing’ Miss Trierweiler and her family.

A spokesman for the Elysee  Palace said that Mr Hollande  would not be taking legal action over the book.

Mr Devedjian said he ‘firmly condemns’ what is written in the book, but has yet to make up his mind about legal action.

Nicolas Sarkozy allegedly paid his friends to carry out surveys on his wife Carla Bruni

Nicolas Sarkozy was at the centre of a £7.6million corruption inquiry yesterday after allegedly paying friends to carry out surveys about his wife Carla Bruni with taxpayers’ money.

Mr Sarkozy, 57, tried to block an investigation into the scandal when he was French president, but lost his immunity on leaving office in May.

Anticor, the anti-corruption association, claims that he spent  €9.4million (£7.6million) on hundreds of polls mainly centred on Miss Bruni, asking how the then First Lady was viewed by the  public. Anticor claims there was no public interest in any of the polls and the taxpayer should not have paid for them.

It has lodged a complaint of ‘embezzlement’ with Paris prosecutors, an offence which could see Mr Sarkozy imprisoned.

Mr Sarkozy strongly denies any wrong-doing.
