A California prison inmate has killed himself by drinking too much water just days after he was taken off suicide watch.

Guards at Monroe Detention Center in Woodland found Todd Alexander Phillips in his cell struggling to breathe on May 18 and rushed him to hospital where he later died.

At first it was unclear why Phillips, who was in custody awaiting trial at the time, became sick. But the Yolo County coroner recently announced the 29-year-old's death was triggered by 'significant intentional liquid consumption.' This fluid overload led to acute hyponatremia – abnormally low sodium in the blood - and eventually caused his brain cells to swell and burst.

However, coroner's officials on Monday deemed the manner of death 'undetermined' rather than suicide as they couldn't tell for sure whether he intended to kill himself by drinking so much water or if it was an accident.

Medical examiners found no signs of 
trauma or drugs and foul play was ruled out, Yolo County sheriff's 
spokesman Mark Persons told The Sacramento Bee.

'It
is unknown if the decedent consumed water to intentionally end his 
life, as an attention-seeking behavior or if he was responding to 
auditory hallucinations,' a coroner's report read, according to The Bee.

Sodium levels in the blood plunge if a person takes in more fluid than their kidneys can process.

The
excessive water causes their cells to expand, which is particularly 
worrisome in the brain because the skull restricts expansion and results
in the brain getting squeezed, potentially fatally.

He faced a return to prison on the charges and had been placed on suicide watch in the weeks prior to his death, sheriff's officials told The Bee.

The newspaper reported that Phillips suffered schizophrenia and battled drug abuse.UC Davis biochemistry professor George A. Kaysen told The Bee schizophrenics and those suffering certain other mental illnesses are prone to drink water compulsively, potentially to the point of death.

But the coroner's report said Phillips had no known history of the disorder and had never attempted to take his life in that manner.

Phillips' suicide watch was lifted in the days before his death, according to the report.

On the day of his death, jailers found Phillips in his bunk 'agitated and upset' at around 12:49 p.m. and he was having difficulty breathing.

His cell, which  contained a sink and toilet, was wet.

Sheriff's officials said Phillips was placed in restraints as a safety measure and rushed to Woodland Memorial Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

The cause of death was cerebral edema or an excess accumulation of fluid in the brain, which results in brain cells bursting
