Cat killer: Andrew Beese on his way to Cheltenham Magistrates court where he was jailed for 14 weeks

A man who stabbed his wife’s cat to death after a drunken row, claiming he 'feared for his life' when it scratched him, was jailed for 14 weeks today.

Andrew Beese, 60, brutally knifed the cat called Koko in his kitchen and was seen throwing it around the room.

He then tossed the blood-soaked body over the fence at the bottom of his garden and set about cleaning the blood from the kitchen.

Beese later told police the animal - which was nursing 12-week-old kittens - had 'gratuitously attacked him' and he feared it would do so again.

He was jailed at Cheltenham Magistrates Court yesterday after being convicted of causing undue suffering to a protected animal.

The court heard how the incident happened after Helen stormed out of their home in Stroud, Glos., after an argument.

In a witness statement, neighbour Sarah Tanner reported hearing loud bangs coming from the property about 4pm on December 29 last year.

Miss Tanner’s home looks directly onto Beese’s property, allowing her a direct view into his kitchen.

RSPCA prosecutor Nick Sutton said: 'She could see he had his back to the window, and was jumping up and down.

'She couldn’t see what he was taking his temper out on but could see he was angry.

'She then saw a cat jump up to the window. She saw him make stabbing motions towards the cat.

'She saw him shake the cat around in the air by the scruff of the neck.'

At this point Miss Tanner called the RSPCA cruelty hotline and police raced to the address.

Beese returned to the kitchen with cleaning products and began trying to remove blood from the walls and surfaces.

When police arrived they found significant amounts of blood on his trousers and in the kitchen.

At
 the time, Beese admitted to killing the cat, but said he had strangled 
it and not stabbed it - the autopsy found no evidence of strangulation.

According to Mr Sutton, Beese told officers: 'I want it dead. It attacked me so I killed it.'

He added: 'The defendant mentioned that the animal had gratuitously attacked him and that he feared for his life.'

Magistrates were shown pictures of small scratches on Beese, which were consistent with cat scratches but in no way life-threatening.

Mr Sutton added: 'The prosecution case is he simply killed this animal out of spite.'

The vet who performed an autopsy reported that the blade was plunged into the side of the cat so hard it reached Koko’s heart and severed her aorta.

Reaction: Mrs Beese was removed from Cheltenham Magistrates' Court  for disrupting events. She yelled: 'My husband is a sick man and does not know his actions'

Steve Woodward, defending, said Beese has bipolar disorder and has issues with alcohol.

He added: 'On that day in question he had drunk a lot.'

In a bizarre turn of events yesterday, Beese’s wife Helen was removed from the court by an order from the magistrates for disrupting events.

Several times she shouted: 'I’m his wife, this shouldn’t be happening.'

She also yelled: 'My husband is a sick man and does not know his actions and I will believe that until the day I die.'

Beese was also banned from keeping animals for 20 years.

Chair of the Bench Peter Langman told him: 'Your actions clearly resulted in the death of an animal which is a protected animal.

'Therefore we are available to give a sentence higher than 18 weeks, but because you have pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity we are going to impose 14 weeks in custody.'

After the sentencing, RSPCA inspector Philip Mann said: 'I would certainly put this case in the top ten worst cases in my career of 21 years.

'The fact that there is a prison sentence for this offence sends out a very strong message to people who think it is permissible to do this sort of thing.'
