Faustino Asprilla retired from a successful, headline-grabbing football career ten years ago, but has now returned to the fore with a new range of flavoured condoms.

The 44-year-old ex-Newcastle forward was an eccentric character during his playing career, and is now showing that he hasn't lost that a decade on.

Asprilla, speaking to Bogota's Radio La FM, explained: 'Some friends of mine in Medellin came up with the flavoured condoms idea, and I thought it would be fun to help out.

'The main goal for me, really, is to support a campaign to prevent Aids and teenage pregnancies, with a line of condoms.'

'Tino', as he is affectionately nicknamed, will be well-known to Newcastle fans for his flamboyancy both on and off the field of play, as he netted 18 times for the Magpies between 1996-1998.

His final three goals for the club came in a remarkable hat-trick against Barcelona, before Kenny Dalglish ran out of patience with his playboy antics and inconsistency over the duration of the 97/98 season.
