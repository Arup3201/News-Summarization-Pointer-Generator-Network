Chocolate lovers across Europe are giving up their favourite snack as the financial crisis eats into their pay packets.

The addictive and relatively affordable treat was once thought recession-proof, but now families are abandoning Kit-Kats and Curly Wurlys in their droves.

Western Europe's chocolate market value is set to fall by around five per cent for 2012, according to food and drink analysts Mintel.

Researchers Nielsen estimate that its value will have plummeted to around $30billion, from 
$31.7billion the previous year.

Nielsen's Jean-Jacques Vandenheede said this was surprising because 'chocolate usually does better than 
average fast moving consumer goods.'

'Chocolate is the archetype of
cheap indulgence so it's the last thing people will drop,' he added.

Portugal and Italy will see some of the 
sharpest falls in market value in Western Europe for 2012, Mintel 
forecast, at -11 per cent and -7 per cent respectively.

It is the first drop in the market since the firm began recording volume for the consumer goods sector in 2007.

'For the first part of the recession we 
thought chocolate would be recession proof, and then we said recession 
resistant, and now I think people are just getting ground down,' said 
Marcia Mogelonsky from Mintel.

Just nuts: The market value has fallen by five per cent this year, analysts predict, although rises in Asia and the Americas have kept chocolate sales steady on a global level

'I have not seen this much of a slowing in the market in the time I've been watching it.

'If the economic outlook continues to be
as sombre as it is now people are not going to rally, they are going to
hunker down even more, and spend even less on food, even on chocolate.'

European cocoa traders said slowing 
chocolate demand and poor cocoa processing margins triggered the resale 
of cocoa beans by major processors last month.

Cocoa futures on Liffe this week fell to their lowest level since July 25.

Double-digit sales in the Americas, Asia
and eastern Europe have helped offset sluggish demand in southern 
Europe, however, according to the world's largest chocolate products maker Barry Callebaut.

Mintel data showed the bright spots for 
growth were in emerging markets in Asia including China, Indonesia and 
Vietnam - but these countries were starting from a low base.

It has meant that the value of the chocolate market globally will be little changed on last year, at $84.5billion for 2012.

China's market value is expected to 
increase by 16 per cent in 2012 to $4.6bn, while Vietnam will be up 11 
per cent at $170m and Indonesia was up nine per cent to $1.2bn, 
according to Mintel figures.

Lee Linthicum, global head of food research at Euromonitor 
International, said that because the markets are so mature in Western Europe: 'there's not much room for volume growth - regardless of
the economic environment.'
