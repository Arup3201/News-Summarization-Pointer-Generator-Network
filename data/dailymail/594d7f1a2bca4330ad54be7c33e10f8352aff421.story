Unflattering: Robson is not flattering when reminiscing about his former recording boss. He compared Simon Cowell to a groper fish

Simon Cowell helped make Robson Green and his Soldier Soldier co-star Jerome Flynn huge singing stars in the 1990s.

But Robson is not flattering when reminiscing about his former recording boss.

‘When I caught my first groper fish on Extreme Fishing, it reminded me of Simon,’ he said.

‘With all the cosmetic surgery he’s had, he is looking more like a groper fish.

'He looks as if he’s been shot out of a cannon.’

The actor also reveals that the song 
that sealed Robson and Jerome’s recording success, Unchained Melody, was
almost never made.

At the time Soldier Soldier was one of the most popular shows on TV, with 17.8 million viewers.

In a 1993 episode, a band didn’t turn up so the pair sang the song.

But it was two years before it was released as a single.

‘I didn’t want to sing. I was already being paid a fortune for what I was doing but Simon wouldn’t let it go,’ said Robson.

‘He was pestering my mother all the time, wanting me to sing that bloody song with Jerome.

'I
got a lawyer to stop him ringing her, then I called him myself and told
him, “If you do it again I will take this to court.

'This is 
harassment.”

Then 
Simon said, “Can I just say, I will give you THIS amount of money if you
record the song.” The amount was in seven figures .  .  . of course I 
said yes.’
