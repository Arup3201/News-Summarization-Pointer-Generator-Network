A war shirt worn by Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce tribe that can be seen in a painting hanging in the Smithsonian Institution has sold for $877,500 at auction.

The shirt is considered to be one of the most important Native American artefacts to ever come to auction.

It had been expected to sell for between $800,000 and $1.2million at the annual Coeur d'Alene Art Auction in Reno, Nevada on Saturday.

Important artefact: This war shirt worn by Chief Joseph of Nez Perce tribe sold for $877,500 at auction in Reno, Nevada, on Saturday

Iconic: Chief Joseph wore the shirt while posing for a portrait by Cyrenius Hall in 1878. That painting, which was used for a U.S. postage stamp, hangs in the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, DC

Auction spokesman Mike Overby said: 
'Anything associated with Chief Joseph is highly desirable, and that's a
pretty special shirt.'

Chief
Joseph wore the shirt in 1877 in the earliest known photo of him, and 
again while posing for a portrait by Cyrenius Hall in 1878. That 
painting, which was used for a U.S. postage stamp, hangs in the 
Smithsonian Museum in Washington, DC.

The
poncho-style war shirt was made of two soft skins, likely deerskin. It 
features bead-work with bold geometric designs and bright colours.

Warriors
kept such prestigious garments clean in a saddle bag on their horse or 
carefully stored while in camp, to be worn only on special occasions, 
American Indian scholar Theodore Brasser noted.

The
shirt surfaced at an Indian relic show in the 1990s and was sold 
without any knowledge of its link to the photo and portrait. It changed 
hands again before the connection was discovered.

Its
quality makes it desirable for collectors, but it's the 'surprising 
discovery of the shirt's role in history that reveals its true 
importance,' said Mr Brasser, a former curator of the National Museum of
Ethnology in Leiden, Netherlands, and at the Canadian Museum of 
Civilization in Ottawa.

Chief Joseph and 750 Nez Perce tribal members were forced to surrender in 1877 after U.S. troops stopped them about 40miles south of the Canadian border, which they had been trying to reach

The photo and portrait showing the war shirt were made shortly after Chief Joseph led 750 Nez Perce tribal members on an epic 1,700-mile journey from Oregon to Montana in an unsuccessful bid to reach Canada and avoid being confined to a reservation.

They were forced to surrender in 1877 after U.S. troops stopped them about 40miles south of the Canadian border.

In a famous speech made after the surrender, Chief Joseph said: 'From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more forever.'

The shirt's sale involved private collectors.

Mr Overby said: 'It was a wild-card piece. We're real happy where it ended up.'

Despite its price, it was not the top-selling piece at the auction.

The painting Scout's Report, by Howard Terpning, went for $994,500, followed by $965,250 for Cowboys Roping The Bear by Frank Tenny Johnson.

Some 400 bidders took part in what's billed as the world's largest Western art sale.

About 300 works were sold for a total of $17.2million, up from $16.9million last year and $9.2million the year before.
