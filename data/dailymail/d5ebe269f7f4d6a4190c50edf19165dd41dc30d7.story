Scotland's referendum battle and the Ice Bucket Challenge craze collided yesterday as Alistair Darling and Alex Salmond both agreed to be soaked for charity.

The leaders of the two campaigns were nominated by Hollywood superstar James McAvoy to accept the challenge.

Former Chancellor Mr Darling, chairman of the pro-Union Better Together group, was first to agree – with activists throwing buckets of ice-cold water over him in a Glasgow park this afternoon.

Better Together campaign chief Alistair Darling accepted the ice bucket challenge after he was nominated by actor James McAvoy today

Mr Darling is due to face Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond in a second debate on independence this Monday

First Minister Mr Salmond accepted the challenge minutes later. He said: 'I’m always up for any challenge, and I’m game for this one.

'It will invigorate me for the next month of campaigning – but the Scottish media should be careful what they wish for, as I get to nominate who’s next for the ice bucket!'

The social media craze is aimed at raising awareness and money for the neurodegenerative disease ALS, or motor neurone disease.

Before being soaked Mr Darling thanked McAvoy and tweeted a link to www.gordonsfightback.com, an awareness-raising site set up by Better Together director of research Gordon Aikman.

Wearing a Scotland rugby top, Mr Darling nominated the staff of Better Together to take up the challenge next. He said: 'One of the good things about being the boss is you can nominate your staff for anything you want and tell them what to do.'

Mr Aikman publicly revealed he is dying of the disease earlier this year and has raised tens of thousands of pounds to raise awareness of the condision.

Among those who threw water over Mr Darling were Better Together’s top spin doctor Rob Shorthouse and former Labour MSP David Whitton.

In his video, X-Men star McAvoy said: "As it is the year of the Scottish referendum on independence, I'd like to nominate our political champions Alistair Darling and Alex Salmond to do their very worst."

As a bucket of icy water is poured over his head, he adds: "Alex, Alistair, you've got 24 hours."

McAvoy said he was nominated for the challenge by Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho.

 

Hollywood actor James McAvoy challenged Mr Darling - the former Labour Chancellor - and SNP First Minister Alex Salmond

Former US president George Bush, actress Gwyneth Paltrow and footballer David Beckham are among a host of well-known faces that have taken the plunge.

McAvoy, who is from Drumchapel in Glasgow, has previously said he is "anti-political" when it comes to independence.

In an interview in May he said: 'I will go with whatever way my country votes, but I don't know which way I want to go yet.'
