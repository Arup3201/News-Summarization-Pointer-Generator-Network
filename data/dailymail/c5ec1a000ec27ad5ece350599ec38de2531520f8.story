A coroner ruled the 'neglect' of tour guides and The Adventure Company played a part in the death of Rachel Burke (pictured)

A coroner has blamed an adventure company for the death of a woman who died while hiking in the Himalayas as guides 'insisted' she undertake a gruelling descent despite suffering severe altitude sickness.

Rachel Burke from Opington, Kent, had become so unwell she was unable to tie her own shoelaces during the Nepalese excursion, it was revealed.

But the 28-year-old was allegedly told by 'untrained' guides at Himalayan Encounters to trek downhill for 10 hours, rather than being taken to a nearby health post, a court heard.

The Ministry of Defence scientist died after attempting to complete the 1,000ft descent in April, one week into the trip arranged by The Adventure Company.

Coroner Andrew Harris described the 'neglect' of one of the guides with whom the woman was left, ruling he was untrained in dealing with altitude sickness.

'I find there was a failure of both companies to ensure the guide taking her down the mountain had the training,' he said.

'Sending Rachel down the mountain with a guide who didn't have those skills was found by Dr Nicholas Mason (an expert in altitude sickness) to be a factor contributing to her death and I accept that.

'Having heard all the evidence it is not entirely clear why Ashok decided not to take Rachel to the health post in Marchermo,' he told Southwark Coroner's Court, adding: ‘It does seem to me that he underestimated the severity of her illness.’

Ms Burke had struggled to keep up with the group as they trekked through Gokoyo Valley in Nepal, it is believed.

Friends who were accompanying the scientist on the trip said she had been unable to carry her own rucksack or tie her shoelaces in the days before her death after climbing 4,470 metres.

On the sixth day of the trip, Ms Burke allegedly told guides she felt too unwell to continue after becoming short of breath.

Rather than accompanying the 28-year-old to the health post that was 15 minutes away, two guides insisted they trek back down the mountain, a feat that would take 10 hours.

The 28-year-old had become so unwell she could barely tie her shoelaces and was unable to carry her own rucksack during the hike in Nepal

One of the guides is alleged to have returned to camp half an hour later, leaving Ms Burke in the hands of an assistant, Ashok, who had not been trained in altitude sickness.

With no satellite phone to call for help, the scientist managed only to descend 100metres in three hours.

She was pronounced dead the following evening in Dole, Kathmandu, after trekking for most of the day.

Dr Nicholas Mason, an expert in altitude sickness said: 'The chain of events that led to Rachel's death began with the decision to send her down.'

It was revealed the group had been asked to climb 600 metres in one day, twice the recommended distance given by tour operators The Adventure Company.

A health and safety executive at the company failed to properly assess the trip's level of risk, the court heard.

Paul Medley, Product and Commercial Director of the company, admitted the itinerary included a 610-metre ascent, but told the court The Adventure Company was 'not aware' of a rescue post in the area.

The scientist has been memorialised at Everest Base Camp in the 'Valley of Death'. Her mother has said she hopes the tragedy makes other adventurers aware of the risk involved

Recording a narrative verdict, Dr Harris said: 'I conclude that death was caused by high altitude cerebral oedema and high altitude pulmonary oedema altitude sickness.' 

He is due to issue a report to insist that tour companies routinely consult
 safety guidelines issued by the Wilderness Medicine Society.

Rachel’s mother Maureen Burke said in an online statement: ‘My daughter went on an adventure holiday and came home in a crate.

'I would really like to know more about my daughters last day on this 
planet and I would like to think that she had the best treatment that 
could have been given, but most of all that her life ended easily 
without any pain and her realising what was happening to her.

‘I just hope that this story is told so that it will make people aware that high altitude sickness can be fatal.’

The 28-year-old had just completed a half marathon and played squash at least once a week. 

The Adventure Company have increased the safety equipment taken on treks and examined their procedures in light of the tragedy.

'We will spend time reviewing the coroner’s findings in detail, and continue to review our processes to ensure that every trip we offer operates safely,’ the company said in a statement.
