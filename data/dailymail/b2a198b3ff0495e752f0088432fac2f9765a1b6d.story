Jose Mourinho's Chelsea side will only feature on live television games seven times until the end of November, less than all of their Premier League title rivals, including Louis van Gaal's Manchester United.

The Blues will also begin their campaign with an away fixture at Burnley on Monday night, while Van Gaal's United side play the opening game of the Premier League season at home against Swansea on Saturday lunchtime.

Van Gaal's United are scheduled to play 10 of their first 13 games on television, the same as both Liverpool and Manchester City.

Arsenal, meanwhile, who finished below 
Chelsea last season in fourth place, will feature on television nine 
times up to the end of November.

Draw: Only seven of Chelsea's first 13 Premier League fixtures will be televised live

Step aside, Jose: Louis van Gaal's Manchester United will feature 10 times until the end of November

10 - Liverpool, Man City, Man Utd

9 - Arsenal 

7 - Chelsea

6 - Aston Villa, Everton, QPR, Tottenham

5 - Newcastle

4 - Burnley, Stoke, Swansea, West Brom, West Ham

3 - Crystal Palace, Hull, Leicester, Southampton, Sunderland

By the time Chelsea kick-off their Premier League title campaign at Turf Moor on Monday, August 18, Manchester United and Arsenal will both have played on Saturday, August 16 while Liverpool and Manchester City will feature on Sky's Super Sunday double bill.

But despite Chelsea having fewer televised games than their rivals, they will face some tricky matches the weekend after Champions League contests.

After each of their first four Champions League group games, Chelsea will face Manchester City at the Etihad, Arsenal at Stamford Bridge, Manchester United at Old Trafford and Liverpool at Anfield. 

Four of Chelsea's six fixtures after Champions League group-stage action will be away from home, while Manchester City face five away days after their six European clashes.

Liverpool and Arsenal, on the other hand, will be at home four times out of six following a Champions League group game.

That is providing Arsenal make it through their play-off tie at the end of August.

Box office: Champions Manchester City, like their neighbours, have 10 live televised fixtures

Loosening up: Liverpool will play the first of their 10 live televised games on the opening weekend of the season
