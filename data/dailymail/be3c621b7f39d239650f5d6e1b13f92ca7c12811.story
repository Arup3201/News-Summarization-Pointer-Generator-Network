An 18-month-old boy suffered life-threatening injuries after allegedly being beaten into a coma by his mother’s boyfriend. 

The mother, Heather Berven, had left her three children in the care of boyfriend Stephan Perebeynos four days earlier, while she was being treated at a mental health facility.

During that time Perebeynos, 28, took a second child, aged three, to a relative’s house, police said.

He then allegedly beat the 18-month-old unconscious in a Fircrest, Washington apartment, at around 1.15pm on Thursday, before calling 911.

Perebeynos told deputies that three-year-old Tyrone Hampton Jr had been  kidnapped by his biological father at a Safeway store.

A search for the missing toddler began and he was later taken to Mary Bridge hospital by the relative, after hearing reports of Perebeynos’ arrest.

‘He made up some big kidnapping story, but we eliminated that pretty quickly,' Pierce County sheriff’s spokesman Ed Troyer told the News Tribune. 'He didn’t want us to find the other victim.'

The third child, a seven-year-old girl, was found safe at school. 

Berven told q13fox.com: 'He's (the baby) in and out of consciousness. He looks at me but he's not responsive. He has hemorrhaging in his brain.'

'All I'm doing is going back and forth with my boys and I pray everything's okay,’ she added to Komo News. ‘Both of his eyes are completely purple and black. He's got a neck brace on right now.’

Doctors told the distraught mother that her baby has a 50 per cent chance of survival, due to the severity of his injuries.

Berven said Perebeynos had never been violent in the past, adding: 'all I know is, he hurt my babies and I don't care what happens to him.’

Her other two children have been placed with the Child Protective Services.

Perebeynos remains in Pierce County Jail charged with first-degree assault on a child.
