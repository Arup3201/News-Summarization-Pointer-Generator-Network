We've all heard of mobile homes, but how about a mobile island?

One designer has put forward a plan for the ultimate yacht accessory - a roll out platform that serves as a private spot in the middle of the ocean.

Measuring some 33ft by 26ft when deployed, Henry Ward's design concept is a folding, floating platform, which  can be stored in the tender bay of a large yacht and opened out when needed.

The pop-up island offers excellent facilities that can give you a closer feeling of being on the sea than on a large boat

Henry Ward came up with the design during his final year of his Transport Design degree at the University of Huddersfield

Deployed using standard overhead tender cranes it can be towed by tender in its folded position to a preferred location – either into a shallow bay that the yacht cannot access, or simply to act as a stern extension to the yacht's existing transom platform, thereby offering a large and flexible space for recreation, dining and relaxing.

An option to configure the island for use as a portable helicopter landing platform is also being investigated, with such a feature allowing existing yachts with no landing facilities, or new designs to have a flexible facility on board, without the need to sacrifice valuable deck space.

Ward is a recent graduate of Transport Design and the concept was initiated as part of a final year project. 

The talented designer told MailOnline Travel: 'We see many potential applications and whilst we continue to technically develop the design further, we are actively seeking a manufacturer who is interested in investing in the development of the product and bringing it to market.

'The Recreational Island started life as my final year project at the University of Huddersfield. I wanted to design an innovative superyacht accessory so began by researching what was being offered by the industry as a whole.

'I soon released that while superyacht guests were able to enjoy spending time on these impressive 265ft vessels, they were not actually connected to the splendour of the sea, being many decks above the waterline. As for visiting beautiful secluded bays, these vessels were also too big to moor up close and let guests enjoy the surroundings.

'I therefore thought to myself 'what if there was a way of launching a floating island that guests could spend the day on with everything they required on board?' The Recreational Island was then born as a versatile platform design that allows guests to create memorable experiences from a safe, private base.'

BMT Nigel Gee, a subsidiary of the BMT Group, is working with Henry Ward Design in the development of the project.

Recognising the creativity of HW Design, BMT has invested in the undertaking of technical studies to assess technical feasibility and engineer the design further. 

The floating island can be folded back up and placed back into the holding bay of the yacht, offering a separate luxury

'This project is a perfect match for BMT Nigel Gee', said yacht design director James Roy.

'We recognise that creativity drives innovation and it is encouraging to see young designers such as Henry initiating ideas such as the Recreational Island. We are strong believers in recognising that the creation and development of new ideas is best accomplished in a collaborative manner - bringing together unique capabilities to achieve the optimum result.'

The team are also investigating the possibility of applying the Recreational Island into the hotel industry, as well as the military and events sectors.  

After Ward's graduation he took the design work to the Monaco Yacht Show in September 2011 where he met BMT Nigel Gee, an industry leading independent yacht design consultancy based in Southampton. 

They were excited by the concept and offered to collaborate and assess the technical feasibility of the Recreational Island. The partners are now working to make the project to reality.
