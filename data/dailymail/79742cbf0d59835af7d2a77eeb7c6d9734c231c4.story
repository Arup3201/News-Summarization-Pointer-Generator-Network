A teenage high school American football player has died after he was hit in a collision during a varsity game and suffered a fatal head injury.

Ridge Barden, a 'lineman' - someone who specialises in play at the line of scrimmage - from Phoenix's John C. Birdlebough High School, complained of a headache and later died.

The 16-year-old was face down after the play Friday 
and was able to sit up unaided, but he collapsed when he tried to stand.

His death has stunned his school community and comes at a time when youth sports are under scrutiny over whether enough is being done to protect young players' heads.

The Birdlebough team were playing at Homer, south of Syracuse, and the hit came about six minutes into the third quarter during a play, Homer police officer Donald Warner said.

An ambulance took Barden, who turned 16 last month, to hospital, 
and he was being transferred to a larger medical centre in Syracuse when
his condition deteriorated, Phoenix School District Superintendent Judy Belfield said.

The ambulance turned around, but doctors were unable to save the boy's life.

The team coaches didn't learn until well after the game that the boy's injuries were so severe and Belfield said: 'The coaches and trainers went over. He was talking. He rolled on his back by himself.'

Officials opened the high school on Saturday to students or staff who wanted to talk about what had happened.

'It just one of those freak things,' Belfield continued. 'The Homer players have to be feeling just as much sadness.'

The Homer Central School District posted a message on its website on Saturday morning saying the community had been 'deeply saddened and shares in the grief of the Phoenix School Community'.

Warner, who was working at the game, said police were investigating but there was no suspicion of criminal activity.

'It looks like just a bad accident,' he said.

Head injuries in football have been a concern across the country in recent years, with some medical evidence emerging to suggest that the equipment players use may not be enough to protect them from serious, long-term injuries.

A handful of high school students suffer fatal on-field injuries every autumn, according to the University of North Carolina's National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research.

A player at Frostburg State University, in Maryland, died after suffering a head injury in a practice in August.

Belfield said the school district sends its football helmets out to be reconditioned every year, and that each has to pass a safety inspection before the season begins.

She said: 'Over the course of the past few years, they have really tried to improve the protection of the head, but there is always a risk of injury or of death.'

She added that an investigation would be conducted to try to determine what went wrong.

In New York, a law signed this summer requires school coaches to bench student athletes who have symptoms of a concussion, a mild traumatic brain injury with symptoms such as dizziness or headaches.

Students can play again only after they are symptom-free for 24 hours and cleared in writing by a doctor.
