More than a billion people are long-sighted and suffer blurry vision when they try to carry out simple tasks like reading a book.

But a new procedure could provide an alternative to reading glasses for people with the age-related condition presbyopia.

It involves slicing the eye open and inserting a tiny lens under the cornea, the clear film that covers the front of the eyeball. 

More than a billion people are long-sighted and suffer blurry vision when they try and read a newspaper, for example. But a procedure could prove an alternative to reading glasses (stock image) for people with the age-related condition, called presbyopia by implanting an inlay into their cornea

Researchers told the annual meeting of the American Academy of Ophthalmology that the implanted  doughnut-shaped inlay improved near vision for 83 per cent of volunteers over the age of 40.

They said that after the operation, the majority of patients were able to read a newspaper without the aid of reading glasses – and the inlay didn’t disturb far distance vision needed for daily activities, such as driving.

The Kamra inlay measures 3.8 millimetres in diameter and has a 1.6 millimetres hole in the centre. It is undergoing clinical review.

Presbyopia affects more than one billion people worldwide - mostly over the age of 40.

As people age, the cornea becomes less flexible and bends in such a way that it becomes difficult to see up close.

While the most common remedy is wearing reading glasses, a host of new corneal inlay products are in development to treat the condition, with three types currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

The theoretical advantage of using corneal inlays over wearing reading glasses is that corneal inlays prevent the need for constantly putting on and taking off glasses, depending on whether the person needs to see near or far. However, all three inlays require an operation.

The procedure involves the eye being sliced open and a Kamra lens inserted into the cornea. There are already alternatives on the market, such as the Raindrop lens (illustrated) which is also inserted into a patient's eye during a medical procedure.

The operation to insert the implant lasts 10 minutes under local anaesthetic.

The new technique could replace laser eye surgery (stock image) which can leave some patients still needing glasses

So far, clinicians in the US, Europe and Asia have studied the effect of the lenses in 507 patients with presbyopia between the age of 40 and 60.

They checked up on the patients over three years and found that in 83 per cent of them, the Kamra lenses gave them 20/40 vision or better.

On average, patients gained 2.9 lines on a reading chart.

Past attempts at implanting corneal inlays have given patients hazy vision, although this was treatable with steroids.

But this more advanced procedure is reversible because the inlays can be removed.

Dr John Vukich, a professor in ophthalmology and vision sciences at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, said: ‘Corneal inlays represent a great opportunity to improve vision with a safety net of removability.’

While the Kamra lens and procedure has not yet been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) it is on sale in Europe, Asia and South America.

There are two other types of corneal inlays - Raindrop Near Vision Inlay and Presbia Flexivue Microlens, which are also in development for the US market.

As well as the Kamra implant, there is a similar one called a 'Raindrop' that is also waiting for approval from the FDA.

The Raindrop Near Vision Inlay is implanted underneath the cornea to correct vision.

The technique was pioneered in America, but has made its way across the Atlantic and is now being used at Space Healthcare in Royal Leamington Spa, Warwickshire.

It could replace laser surgery, which until now has been deemed the only long-term treatment, even though it leaves some recipients requiring reading glasses in dim light.

The procedure takes around 10 minutes, compared to laser surgery which takes approximately one hour.

Anaesthetic droplets are inserted into the patient's eye so they remain conscious throughout the procedure, as the implant is placed under a flap of the cornea.

It corrects near medium vision by changing the shape of the cornea, with the central section becoming steeper.

The procedure costs £2,495 and is not currently available on the NHS.
