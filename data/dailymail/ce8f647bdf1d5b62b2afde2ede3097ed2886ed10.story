A former government minister who resigned yesterday over the ‘intolerable’ pressure placed on his family by the new Commons expenses regime has been ridiculed today over his claim that £28,000 in rent is not enough.

Mark Simmonds, the former Foreign Office minister, said the Commons housing allowance would force to him to live in the ‘outer reaches of London’ which he was not prepared to do. 

But the MailOnline has found a number of luxury flats within half a mile of Westminster which he could easily afford from his taxpayer-funded housing allowance. 

There are also scores of four-bed family homes in London's sought-after suburbs - home to hundreds of thousands of Conservative voters - within Mr Simmonds' budget.

Labour MPs today accused the former minister of talking 'total nonsense' and said he was guilty of expecting taxpayers to pay for luxuries few other families could afford.

Within half a mile of Parliament there are at least seven luxury flats available for MPs to rent within their £20,000 a year housing allowance. Many of the flats are in complexes which boast private gyms and pools

Mark Simmonds resigned from the Government complaining that his family life had become 'intolerable'

Mr Simmonds has a budget of £20,600-a-year for himself and an extra £2,425 for each child if he wants to rent a property big enough for his family - even though they live in his Lincolnshire constituency of Boston and Skegness.

If the Tory MP insisted on bringing down his family for weekends, he has a number of options for accommodation close to Westminster.

For a home within easy walking distance from Westminster Mr Simmonds could rent a mid-terrace Georgian house conversion with three large double bedrooms, a big family kitchen, living room and a garden in Oval - less than 2 miles from Parliament. The house costs £24,444 a year.

If he was willing to use public transport, the allowance would get him a luxury four bed semi-detached property with large garden in Bromley, South London, for £27,000 a year.

Bromley – a core Conservative-stronghold in London’s commuter belt – is just 20 minutes away from Victoria station, which is just 15 minutes walk from Parliament.

Mr Simmonds earned £89,435 a year as a minister and employed his wife on up to £25,000 a year as his office secretary.

The family also made more than £500,000 after selling their taxpayer-funded London property in 2010 after the Commons expenses regime banned MPs from claiming mortgage interest on their second homes.

If Mr Simmonds opted for a one-bed flat for himself to stay in London, while his family stayed in his constituency his ‘generous’ Commons housing allowance would allow him to stay in the lap of luxury.

According to the online estate agents ‘rightmove’, Mr Simmonds could afford a one-bedroom apartment less than half a mile from Parliament.

The luxury, fully-furnished property allows access to a communal gardens and leisure facilities - including a pool and a gym.

If the former Foreign Office minister could cope with a 20 minute train ride from Bromley, he could rent a four bed house in the South London commuter belt

Another apartment just a stones throw from Westminster available in Mr Simmonds' price bracket is a 'beautiful one bedroom fully furnished apartment with a secure underground car parking space close to local amenities and St James' underground tube station'.

'The property was fully refurbished in 2009 and remains in excellent condition throughout. The property also has a private balcony that overlooks the gardens to the rear.'

According to the estate agents renting the property 'residents of Vestry Court enjoy exclusive use of the private swimming pool, Jacuzzi, sauna and gym facilities'.

It is 'conveniently located for access to London's West End, and Waterloo and Westminster underground stations', according to the estate agent.

Labour MP John Mann said Mr Simmonds was talking 'total nonsense'

Labour MP John Mann said Mr Simmonds’ claim he could not afford to live in London on the Commons housing allowance was ‘total nonsense’.

He said: ‘The £28,000 he can get is more than the average salary in his constituency. It’s simply untrue that you can’t rent in London for that much. It’s a poor excuse for going.’

Mr Mann also hit out at Mr Simmonds’ assumption that taxpayers should fork out so his family could stay in London and his constituency.

He said: ‘His children can’t be in two places at once while they are at school. They allowance is an essential living allowance and it is generous.’

Fellow Labour MP Grahame Morris added: ‘I think his comments will gain little public sympathy when under his government most working families, especially in London, are facing a cost of living crisis forcing ordinary people on much more modest incomes to live further away from their place of work and commute longer distances.

‘Perhaps as a minister he is also lamenting the loss of previous paid directorships which can be very lucrative.’

But Mr Simmonds insisted the current allowance ‘doesn’t stretch anywhere near the cost of renting a flat near Westminster’.

He said: ‘Now of course MPs want to get into the business of travelling extensively from Westminster to the outer reaches of London to rent a flat then that’s up to them, it’s not the lifestyle I want, it is not the lifestyle I have chosen for my family.’

He added: ‘I have to stay in a different hotel room every week and any parent would hate that – and I do.

‘The accommodation allowance needs to provide for families – and it doesn’t. When my children are on holiday they can’t come and stay with me in London - I can’t see them.’

‘It has a really negative impact on the quality of life. I am not the only one who feels like this, but I am the only one at the moment who is doing anything about it.’
