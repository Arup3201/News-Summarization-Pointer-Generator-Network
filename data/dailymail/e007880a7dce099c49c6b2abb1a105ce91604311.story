Sean Dyche's transfer dealings may extend into Europe for the first time this January, although the Burnley boss was bemused by suggestions he is about to bring an Ecuadorian to east Lancashire.

The Clarets' squad is the only one in the Barclays Premier League made up entirely of British and Irish players, with Dyche previously acknowledging the club did not have the scouting network in place to cast their net on to the continent.

That changed last month when former Everton and Manchester United scout Robbie Cooke was hired to take up the role of UK and international scout as one of last season's promoted clubs bid to adapt to life in the top flight.

Dyche brought in eight British and Irish players during the summer transfer window 

'It's well documented we were behind the curve with regards the recruitment system,' said Dyche.

'We had one but we weren't going into Europe. Now we are venturing over there.

'That doesn't mean we are going to sign anyone but we are beginning to get the background and trying to get depth of knowledge that's needed in recruitment.

'But there's no guarantees; they don't just grow on trees out there.

'There's this misconception that you go into Europe and there's thousands of players who are all brilliant for the Premier League. It's not so.

'We still have to define the ones that are right, we still have to align them with the team and what fits the team moving forward.'

While branching out into those avenues could see a host of new players linked with a move to Turf Moor, Dyche scoffed at the one potential new recruit who was suggested as a possible target.

Junior Sornoza, a 20-year-old attacking midfielder plying his trade in South America, was mooted as a player Burnley were keen on this week, which came as a surprise to Dyche.

'Who is that? That's news to me,' he added.

'It would be highly unlikely that (our scouting) goes that far afield. We're starting off building a base in England, going into Europe as the first marker and if and when there's time to go beyond that, we'll see. But certainly not at the moment, no.'

Dyche baulked at the fees commanded by British-based players over the summer and there could be a chance that he taps into a market which may offer cheaper alternatives when the transfer window reopens.

That could prevent him from finding the same frustrations as he found last summer, with the Clarets manager knowing January bargains will be hard to find closer to home.

'The British market has been a lot more unpredictable and a lot higher than it has been historically,' Dyche said.

'It's always been thought of as higher than going into Europe, which is why there are so many players from further afield coming into the English game, particularly at the Premier League level. We've found that it has been very, very tough.

'I can't see it going backwards. With the new TV deal, everyone tells me that's going to go up. There's every chance the fees, contracts, wages, will go up in turn. It's a tough challenge for us as a club.'
