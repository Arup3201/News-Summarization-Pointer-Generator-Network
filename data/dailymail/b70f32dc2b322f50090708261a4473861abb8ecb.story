Manchester United are hoping to announce Louis van Gaal as their new manager next week, with Ed Woodward conducting a conference call with investors on Thursday.

United have been tracking the Holland coach for weeks and are edging closer to revealing their new man.

Woodward claimed that wages are set to rise at Old Trafford this summer, while work is already 'being done' on signing new players.

Thanks for joining. Should be a very interesting few weeks at Manchester United. 

Manchester United chief executive Ed Woodward claims transfer deals are in the process of 'being done' at Old Trafford and that the club will be 'active' in the summer window. 

An announcement on Louis van Gaal becoming David Moyes' successor will be made 'in due course', while the cost of not qualifying for next season's Champions League will cost the club upwards of £30million. 

But despite that, they intend to spend big on wages, with a third quarter percentage increase in the 'high-teens' as a recruitment drives takes hold. 

And that concludes the conference call. Nothing specific on Louis van Gaal. 

Woodward: We will be active in the transfer market. Deals are being done, but we haven't committed yet. 

Moyes' compensation will be revealed in good time but is in the 'single digit millions'. 

There is no tangible link between investment in the squad and the company. 

Season tickets are selling well. 

Woodward indicates the goal at Manchester United is to qualify for the 2015-16 Champions League.

We knew that, but good to have it in black and white. 

Woodward says impact of not qualifying for Europe will cost club 'mid-£30m's' in 2015. 

'That relates to broadcast money. 

'Our aim absolutely is to get back into the Champions League.' 

'Due to appearance fees and negotiations, we expect the wage increase [as a percentage] to be high-teens, not mid-teens. We expect wages to go up in the fourth quarter.

'We expect there to be an inflation in player wages. We're looking at investing this summer anyway.'  

'We continue to support FFP.'

Wages expected to be higher than United had previously expected for the fourth quarter. 

United are reiterating that the third quarter revenue is a record for the club. 

'We finished a very disappointing seventh. Everyone at the club are working hard to ensure we perform as expected next year. 

'We're very grateful to Ryan Giggs for taking on the reins on an interim basis. 

'We're now focused on bringing in a new manager and expect to make an announcement in due course. In the meantime we continue to be active in the transfer market.'

Ah, here we go... there will be a Q&A session after an initial club presentation. We'll be summarising the best bits. 

Gone one o'clock and no sign! Scandal! 

Almost ready to kick off, we've been very politely informed. 

Chris Wheeler: Ryan Giggs has been offered the job of Louis van Gaal’s No 2 at Manchester United after holding secret talks at the Dutchman’s penthouse apartment.

Giggs was seen coming out of a hotel in the seaside town of Noordwijk, 20 miles southwest of Amsterdam, and it is understood that the discussions took place at Van Gaal’s luxury home a few hundred yards away.

Ian Ladyman: Manchester United will not name Louis van Gaal as their new manager until next week.

The Barclays Premier League club have agreed most of the details of the 62-year-old’s new contract at Old Trafford and had hoped to officially announce the appointment on Thursday.

It is understood, however, that United have not yet managed to agree upon all the specifics with their incoming manager.

The key nugget to take away from that announcement then is the fact that United's third quarter revenue is up 26 per cent to £115.5 million.

Almost one-and-a-half Gareth Bales. 

Oh, and the debt's down to £351.7m too. 

Manchester United say they have the financial power to reinforce the squad following their worst Premier League season.

The team went from champions to a seventh-place finish and fired manager David Moyes less than 10 months after succeeding Alex Ferguson.

But in the first three months of 2014, as United reached the Champions League quarterfinals and new sponsorship deals were made, revenue rose by 26 percent to £115.5 million.

United vice chairman Ed Woodward says 'impressive year over year growth' ensures they are in a 'healthy financial position to continue to invest in the squad.' 

Woodward says the club is 'working hard to ensure the team is back challenging for the title and trophies.'

Good afternoon all. This ought to be an interesting interlude to your day - Ed Woodward is holding the Manchester United PLC Earnings conference call at one o'clock. 

The chief executive will doubtless be asked tricky questions on David Moyes' sacking and the imminent arrival of Louis van Gaal. 

There are other issues enveloping the club at the moment - including player contracts - which may be brought up by investors.
