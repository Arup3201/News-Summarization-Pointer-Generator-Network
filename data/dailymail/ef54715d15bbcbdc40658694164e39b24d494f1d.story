England will intensify their preparations for Euro 2015 by spending a week at their summer base later this month.

The Football Association were criticised following the last two Under-21 European Championships in Denmark (2011) and Israel (2013) for failing to prepare properly and that was shown by results, as they failed to win any of their games at those tournaments.

This time, however, the FA have no intention of repeating such mistakes and that is why Gareth Southgate will take the Under-21s to Olomouc in a fortnight for a training camp ahead of the friendly against Czech Republic on March 27.

That game will be staged in Prague but England are going out early to get a first experience of the base they will use in June. England are in Group B, along with Portugal, Italy and Sweden, and will play two games in Olomouc.

The FA sent a delegation out to the Czech Republic as soon as the draw for the finals was made last November and are happy with the hotel they have chosen but they now want to test the pitches and other facilities ahead of the tournament.

Southgate will name his squad for the forthcoming friendlies against the hosts and Germany, at Middlesbrough on March 30, on Thursday week.
