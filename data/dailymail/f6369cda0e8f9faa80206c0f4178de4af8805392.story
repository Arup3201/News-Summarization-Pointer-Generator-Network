Death: Peter Barnes, 32, hung himself in the grounds of Cygnet Hospital in Wyke after he was let out for a cigarette by staff

A psychiatric patient was found hanged a few yards away from hospital after he was let out for a cigarette.

Peter Barnes, 32, vanished from Cygnet Hospital in Wyke, Yorkshire in October.

He was found hanged a week later just 30 yards from the hospital’s front door.

Mr Barnes was allowed out unescorted for a 30-minute cigarette break despite previously talking about killing himself, an inquest at Bradford Coroner's court heard.

A senior clinician at the hospital had not been told by nurses about marks seen on his neck or how he had been talking about ending his life hours before.

The inquest heard how one nurse told police investigating his disappearance, 'I think he will be sat somewhere with a couple of cans of Stella'.

Post-mortem examinations showed he was likely to have died just hours after he went missing.

Mr Barnes was let down by 'gross failures and neglect' at the hopsital on 13 October, 2011, the inquest heard.

Speaking today his mother, Karen Barnes, 54, from Lincoln, said she hoped lessons would be learned from her son's death

She said: 'At long last Peter’s voice has been heard through his inquest. We have heard what he was feeling - making himself heard was something he had to fight for all through his illness.

'He was failed by Cygnet. We now hope what happened to Peter and the outcome of the inquest will be used as a precedent and lesson to be learned stopping any other families going through the agony we have suffered.

'It is just heartbreaking these people are in the profession of looking after vulnerable people and yet they haven’t got any compassion.

'There is nothing they can see to make me feel any better.

Incident: Mr Barnes was a patient at Cygnet Hospital, Wyke, West Yorkshire

'A former member of staff came up to me and told me they had planted a tree in the grounds for Peter and one member of staff who died, and I just looked at her and thought that’s really apt isn’t it. Have they got no sense?'

Mother-of-three Mrs Barnes said her son suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and was psychotic.

She explained he was diagnosed at 16 and had been in and out of hospital since then.

She said he was put on an intensive care secure unit at Cygnet after he attacked a doctor. He was there for just over three weeks before he hung himself.

The inquest heard Dr Keith Rix had
allowed Mr Barnes unescorted leave because he hadn’t been warned that he 
had marks on his neck or had talked about killing himself.

Neither had those details been flagged up by nurses to the ward manager responsible for safety.

During the inquest the jury heard evidence from Donna Bingley, a senior nurse at the privately-run West Yorkshire hospital.

This
included a 999 call in which the nurse told the operator Mr Barnes had a 
long-history of violent behaviour and he could be of risk to
others when his medication wore off.

But she made no mention of potential self-harm.

Miss
Bingley told the inquest: 'I wasn’t demanding they get the helicopters 
out. I was just following procedure to report it to the police.'

The jury heard when the operator asked
her, 'So is there any genuine concern at all?' she had replied: 'I 
think really he will just have gone off and have a couple of cans of 
Stella or make his way home to Lincoln, but I think he will be sat 
somewhere with a couple of cans of Stella', adding, 'Usually they go up 
to the Co-op'.

Mother Mrs Barnes said it wasn’t until 
six days later an officer 'just happened' to pick the case up and 
brought it to her boss’ attention.

The next day they searched the 
grounds and found Peter’s body in ten minutes, Mrs Barnes said.

The jury ruled unanimously that Mr Barnes had taken his own life while the balance of his mind was disturbed.

Assistant Coroner Neil Cameron said he would write to the hospital about his concerns following the verdict.

The jury also stated the hospital’s systems and methods of communication ensuring Mr Barnes' clinician had all the information needed to decide whether or not to allow unescorted ground leave had been 'inadequate'. They said this led to an error which gave him the opportunity to take his own life.

The response of the hospital and its staff to his disappearance and the efforts they made to find him were 'untimely and inappropriate', they ruled.

The jury foreman concluded: 'His death was contributed to by neglect, namely by the aforementioned gross failures of hospital systems and the failure to communicate and identify significant events which led to him wrongly being granted unescorted ground leave.'

In a statement last night a Cygnet spokesman said: “We were struck during these proceedings by the love and care that Mr Barnes was given by his family all through his life and our thoughts are with his family and friends at what must be an incredibly difficult time.”

“We have already made numerous changes to further improve our services. Communication inside Wyke has been totally overhauled.”
