The statement released by West Midlands Police
said: ‘Daisy’s death has left a gaping hole in our lives. We are amazed
at how much one little girl touched so many people’s hearts.

‘We would like to thank everybody for 
their support - family, friends, all the staff at New Cross Hospital, 
and the police officers.’

The driver of the Honda Civic involved
in the incident in Wolverhampton was not arrested but has been spoken 
to by police officers, who are seeking witnesses.

Daisy had been playing outside her home with her parents and some of her new toys when she was hit by a car.

She had spent the day celebrating with 20 family and friends and going to a local park.

Mrs Brooks had earlier told how a joyful family celebration in a split second turned to tragedy.

She said: ‘She had had a lovely day. There were lots of her friends at the party.

‘They played pass the parcel and went
to the park. We would like to thank everybody for their support. Daisy 
will never be forgotten.’

Her
father Simon Davies, 37, added: ‘Daisy was a lovely little girl who 
always had a smile on her face. She was funny and cheeky.

‘Her
nickname was “Pud” because after she was born we bought her a musical 
Christmas pudding hat, and the name just stuck. We have still got that 
hat.’

Daisy was taken to hospital after the accident at 5pm on Saturday but died of her injuries hours later.

Mrs Davies said: ‘The doctors and nurses were brilliant.

‘They tried their best but sadly could not save her.’

Dozens of floral tributes and teddy bears have been left in the front garden at her home in Wolverhampton, some from fellow pupils and teachers at Springdale Infants School.

One in a child’s writing, decorated with pink hearts, read: ‘I’m so sad I’m not going to play with you again.’

Daisy had two sisters, Chelsea, 11, and Hollie, eight, and a brother, Liam, nine.

Police described her death as a ‘tragic accident’. Officers have spoken to the driver of the Honda Civic car but no one has been arrested.
