He has claimed that he fathered Kourtney Kardashian's son Mason amid a steamy love affair.

But before taking the case to court, Michael Girgenti reportedly wrote an impassioned letter to the reality star urging her to submit to a DNA test.

According to RadarOnline the letter, dated 23 April, stated that the 26-year-old male model wished to avoid dragging Kourtney and her partner Scott Disick to court.

'My attentions [sic] are not to hurt the family you've created with Scott,' Girgenti wrote.

'Please take this final request for a DNA test seriously,' he wrote before taking on a more stern tone: 'Because if you don't, I will be forced to take legal action and sue.'

He continued: 'I assure you I don't take being a father lightly. I will be a great father to Mason.'

Last week, Girgenti filed paperwork at a Los Angeles County Superior Court in
a bid to get joint custody of the three-year-old child 
alleging he had unprotected sex with the reality TV star nine months 
before Mason's birth.

life drama: Kourtney and boyfriend Scott Disick were seen

The lawsuit documents the alleged 
relationship between Kourtney and Michael, which he claims heated up in August 2008, and continued with months of texting in which she told him her relationship with Scott was 'on the 
outs' and 'she wanted to hang.'

According
to gossip website TMZ.com, Michael wants the judge to order DNA tests 
for Kourtney, Mason and her long-term boyfriend Scott Disick - 
who is father to her daughter Penelope, 13 months.

A hearing has been set for next month.

Furious: Kourtney said she was 'furious' when the allegations first emerged, and the model has now filed a claim with the court

Kourtney who in March was said to be 'furious' over Gigenti's claims has yet to comment personally on the fresh allegations. And her spokeswoman has not responded to requests for comment.

However her lawyer told TMZ.com on Friday that Gigenti's allegations are 'absurd'.

'This individual has been selling false and fabricated stories to the tabloids for years about Kourtney Kardashian and her son, Mason.  Scott Disick is Mason’s father,' Todd Wilson told the website.

'We have not seen the reported court filing, but we are informed that this individual has been seeking to get paid to publish his ridiculous pleading. 

'His claims are absurd and this is simply another shameful attempt to gain publicity and profit from fictional stories about my client.'

Photogenic: Kourtney and Michael met on a photo shoot in 2008, but the star's attorney says there was no further contact after that

The reality star was seen outside her
lawyer's office on Wednesday, no doubt seeking advice over the 
embarrassing and upsetting lawsuit.

Michael
claims they had full sex and as soon as she had given birth to Mason - 
born on 14 December 2009 - he tried contacting her.

The allegations first came to light 
in March earlier this year when he told In Touch magazine: 'After 
[Mason] was born, and I saw photos of him, I began to wonder.

'I would definitely want to acknowledge Mason if he's my kid - he deserves to know his real father.'

A
legal representative for the Kourtney & Kim Take Miami star previously branded the Chicago native's allegations 'preposterous and an
outrageous lie'.

So it must have come as a surprise that the model has now filed papers with the court.

In
addition to son Mason, the couple - who have been dating on and off for
seven years - have a baby daughter, Penelope Scotland, together.

Just last week it was reported that Kourtney was pregnant with her third child.

She
did not comment on the rumours, although was later seen eating sushi 
with her family - a food type pregnant women are advised to steer clear of due to the raw fish ingredients.

This is not the first time the extremely wealthy Kardashian family has been confronted by allegations of paternity.

Kourtney's younger sister Khloe, 28, 
has had to regularly deny rumours that their late father Robert 
Kardashian was not her biological father.

Their half-sister Kylie Jenner, 15, also recently hit back at reports that Bruce Jenner may not be her real father.
