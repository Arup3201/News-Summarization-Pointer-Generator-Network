His cousins have balanced balls and clapped their flippers for generations of crowds at the circus.

But this sea lion now has a stunt of his own.Â 

With unwavering balance and effortless cool, he surfed a crashing wave into the beach of Vancouver Island - astounding onlookers.

There was no need for a surf board as the pup assumed an elegant pose - with flippers in and head to the sky - and soared towards the Canadian shore.

People leaped for their cameras to capture the unconventional beach boy - who was followed by his troupe of 20.

They judged it perfectly - as the summer drew to a close and windy weather started picking up, the waves were at their prime.

After waiting for a huge swell, the playful mammal rushed to catch the curling water.

Off and away, he rode it for 50 to 100 metres before disappearing beneath the foam.

The clan of surfers have become obsessed with their new talent since they first discovered it last month.

Instead of splashing around the water, they follow a strict routine of daily 'runs' that last for 30 minutes.

Full time photographer and trained behavioural ecologist, Brad Hill, managed to capture the rare moment on camera on 22 August.

Brad said: 'The sea lion was definitely surfing, every sea lion that caught a wave coming at our direction stared at us for their entire ride and never broke eye contact.

'We watched the sea lions taking surfing runs for at least 30 minutes on this occasion, and the same the following day when we returned.

'The sea lions were being extremely selective of which waves they chose to work with, we even observed some waves with two lions surfing side-by-side, a few with three sea lions surfing and even one wave with four sea lions coming down together.

'When a sea lion completed its own run, it would instantly turn around and swim back and do it again and again, and again.

'It was really hard to watch these frolicking sea lions and not think they were surfing for any reason other than having old fashioned fun!'
