A Massachusetts couple have been charged with manslaughter for allegedly killing their 5-month-old daughter by giving her a bottle of formula with heroin in it.

Ryan Barry, 30, and Ashley Cyr, 26, both of Quincy, were arrested Friday. They pleaded not guilty and were ordered held on $200,000 cash bail.

The couple's daughter, Mya Barry, died in September 2011, when the family lived in Marshfield, a half-hour drive southeast of Quincy.

Police responded to a 911 call and found the baby on the living room floor with her grandmother performing CPR on her, Plymouth County District Attorney Tim Cruz's office said.

Baby Mya was rushed to South Shore Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead a short time later.

Police said they found 3 grams of heroin and hypodermic needles on a shelf in a bedroom shared by Barry, Cyr, the baby and her two sisters, ages 3 and 4.

Bad mother: Barry told police that he had seen Cyr snort heroin off a Dr. Seuss book and then leave the book on the floor

Prosecutor Frank Middleton said Barry told police that Cyr was reckless in her drug use and that he had seen her snort heroin off a Dr. Seuss book and then leave the book on the floor where the kids could get at it.

Middleton said in court that Barry told police that at around 7.30am on September 23, 2011, he had made the baby's last bottle by mixing 2 ounces of formula with 2 ounces of water. 

He said that when Barry was pressed on how the heroin could have gotten into the bottle he said maybe someone had cleaned a dirty syringe in the water bottle he used to make the formula.

Testing determined that the baby formula in the bottle contained heroin. An autopsy determined that the baby died from opiate poisoning.

A grand jury returned manslaughter indictments against Barry and Cyr Thursday. Cyr also was charged with one count of reckless endangerment of a child.

Middleton said in court that baby Mya 
was born addicted to heroin because her mother had used the drug on a 
daily basis during her pregnancy.

Barry's
lawyer, Liam Scully, said that it was unclear who put the heroin in the
baby's bottle and that Barry denies any wrongdoing.

'He was devastated by the death of his daughter and is coping with that tragedy the best that he can,' Scully said.

Excuse: Barry (right) told police that the heroin may have gotten into the formula he had prepared when someone had cleaned a dirty syringe in the water bottle he used

Cyr's lawyer didn't immediately return a call seeking comment Friday.

Barry and Cyr are due back in court November 8 for a pretrial conference.

The Boston Globe reported that Barry has had a number of run-ins with the law over the years. In 2006, he pleaded guilty to raping a girl younger than 16 years old during a drug- and alcohol-fueled party.

He was sentenced to 2 ½ years in prison, but served 15 months and was placed on three years’ probation.

Last April, the 30-year-old man also pleaded guilty to heroin possession.
