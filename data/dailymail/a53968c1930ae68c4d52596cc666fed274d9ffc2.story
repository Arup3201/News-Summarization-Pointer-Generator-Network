A teenage girl reported missing in February amid fears she’d
been lured into a prostitution ring was found standing in line for a television
shoot in Venice Beach on Friday.

Police say the girl, who ran away from her Aurora, Colorado
home February 5, was with friends and appeared unharmed.

‘I’m fine,’ the 18-year-old Raven Cassidy Furlong told an
NBCLA photographer Friday. ‘Everybody can leave me alone because I've been fine
and I am fine.’

'I'm fine': Raven Cassidy Furlong,(pictured) reported missing for two months, was spotted in Los Angeles, unharmed and with friends April 5

Police had already investigated a tip that Furlong had been
spotted in the Venice Beach area of Los Angeles.

"[She was] waiting in line with some friends, some
other people for a TV shoot," Sgt. Daniel Gonzalez of the Los Angeles
Police Department Pacific Division said.

Furlong was reportedly at a taping for NBC’s American Ninja
Warrior.

Police asked Furlong to come to the station for questioning
and, without resisting, she complied.

Eighteen: Furlong told police 'I'm fine' and since she turned 18 while listed as a missing person and police say she seemed unharmed, she was released

Furlong admitted to police that she was a runaway and the
subject of a search by her family.

Though she was 17-years-old when her family reported her
missing, Furlong is now 18 and told police she was in Los Angeles
voluntarily.

Police informed Furlong’s family that she’d been found.

‘She didn't appear to be under the influence of any alcohol or drugs. She didn't appear to be given us any type of coerced statements,’ said.Sgt. Gonzalez.

Not everyone agrees, however.

Furlong’s mother, Tonja Mahaffey, continues to believe her
daughter is a ‘scared victim of trafficking’ who lied
to the police about her well-being.

Convinced: Furlong's mom Tonja Mahaffey knows her runaway daughter was found but maintains she's the victim of coercion, possibly forced into the sex trade

‘I can tell that it’s her, but that’s not my daughter,’
Mahaffey told ABC 7 in Denver.

Mahaffey continues to post to a Facebook page she started
for her then missing daughter and says the family is still trying to get her
back.

The family plans to be on a radio show called Voices for
Justice April 8 and hope Furlong will call in to speak to them.

But Furlong maintained that she did not want to return to
Colorado and, at least for now, that’s the end of this story.

‘She's 18,’ said Sgt. Gonzalez, who removed Furlong from a
missing persons list. ‘She's an adult.’
