Janet Rogers, 94, who lay bruised and bloodied in the gutter for nearly three-and-a-half hours waiting for an ambulance

A 94-year-old woman was forced to lie in a gutter while she waited for an ambulance for more than three hours after she fell off her mobility scooter.

Janet Rogers, came off her scooter on a sloping pavement near her home in the village of Farndon, Nottinghamshire, badly bruising her head, arms and legs.

Her daughter, Jane Rogers, said an ambulance was called at about 11.50am but did not arrive until after 3.10pm.

She said that her frail mother was left lying on the road unable to move or have a drink on the advice of the emergency call operator.

Her daughter and carer, 64, also of Farndon, said it was disgraceful.

'I just thought it was horrendous,' she said.

'It was a very hot day. She was lying in the road on the gravel. She couldn’t move and she couldn’t have water.

'We explained she was 94 but were told the call was not a priority. I couldn’t believe it when we were told it wasn’t urgent. It was horrific.'

Mrs Rogers, who is recovering well, said: 'The pavement was on a slope and I just went over.

'I remember banging my head and there was blood everywhere.

”It was so hot in the road just lying there. I was glad of any help. I just had to wait.

First aiders from Farndon St Peter’s Primary School helped tend to Mrs Rogers and neighbours sheltered her with an umbrella and propped her up to keep her comfortable.

A lone paramedic arrived at about 2.30pm and when the ambulance eventually came it took her to King’s Mill Hospital, Sutton-in-Ashfield, Notts, not arriving there until about 4.30pm.

Mrs Rogers had a head scan and was patched up before being sent home at about 8pm.

The incident has left her with severe bruising on her face, cuts and bruises on her arms and legs and ripped the skin off one of her thumbs.

Jane Rogers said: 'It is a miracle she wasn’t more badly hurt. I don’t know how she didn’t break anything. '

'She is made of tough stuff. I think she will make 100.'

Jane Rogers said there should be better ambulance and hospital provision in Newark.

'Why we couldn’t have had an ambulance from Newark and gone to hospital in Newark, I don’t know,' she said.

Bridget Ashworth, who lived nearby, said: 'I went out to get some shopping and saw there had been some kind of accident, and when I came back three hours later the poor lady was still there, laid out.

'I couldn’t believe it. It’s disgusting.'

A spokesman for East Midlands Ambulance Service said: 'The service we provided to Janet clearly fell short of the high standard our patients should expect.

'We are very sorry that she had to wait so long for help.

'We are now investigating the circumstances to understand why the delay happened and as soon as we know the reasons, we will contact her direct with our findings.'
