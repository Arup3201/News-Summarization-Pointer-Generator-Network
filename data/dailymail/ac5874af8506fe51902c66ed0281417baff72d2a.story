Tony Abrahams, 47, was stabbed three times after he confronted burglars in his home

A teenage boy has appeared in court charged with the attempted murder of a father-of-three in his own home during a burglary.

The 16-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, stands accused over an attack on Tony Abrahams.

Mr Abrahams, aged 47 years, was stabbed repeatedly by intruders after his daughter was woken by them in her bedroom at 3.25am.

He confronted them and was attacked on his own landing.

The burglars then fled the red-brick home, in Luton, Bedfordshire.

Doctors described his condition as serious but stable following treatment to four knife wounds.

Detectives investigating the attack arrested the teenager in London.

He has also been charged with aggravated burglary of a rose gold watch, a Blackberry mobile phone, £240 pounds in cash and a set of car keys.

Following the appearance before Luton Youth Court the young defendant was remanded into secure accommodation, to appear before a judge at Luton Crown Court today.

Police were still appealing for anyone with information on the attack to contact them.

Mr Abrahams, said to be in a serious but stable condition, was taken to Luton and Dunstable Hospital after his wife Catrina, 52, and daughter raised the alarm at 3.25am.

 His  two daughters briefly appeared earlier this week to say: 'Dad is doing alright.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
