Britain's first gay parents have spoken of the horror as they thought they were going to die after becoming stranded in a flooded road.

Millionaires Barrie and Tony 
Drewitt-Barlow, who have had five children by a surrogate, were travelling back from Essex Fashion week when a river bank flooded and they became immersed in water 5ft deep.

They were rescued from the roof of their brand new Range Rover after clambering out of the window as the car started to fill up with water.

Today, Barrie told MailOnline: 'The car started filling up with water and it went dark. We had to climb out of the window. I thought I was going to die.'

The couple, wearing tuxedoes, were rescued just after 
midnight yesterday by a fire crew after Tony called 999.

It took approximately 15 firefighters nearly an hour to rescue them and take them to safety in Chelmsford, Essex.

Tony, 48, and Barrie, 43, were forced to abandon their possessions in the car, including a laptop and photo albums, which they say have now been stolen.

They are offering a £5,000 reward for anyone who finds them.

The fathers were heading back from filming with the Only Way is Essex stars at Essex Fashion Week.

Barrie told MailOnline: 'We had just finished a meal out with friends after the fashion week and were heading home. We had just dropped Saffron off at her friends house, thank God.

'We had driven down the lane only an hour and a half before and it was clear so we drove through the ford as normal when all of a sudden the bank flooded and water came at us spinning the car around three times.

'The car started filling up with water and it went dark. Tony called 999 and stayed on the phone with them until the fire services arrived.

'We had to climb out of the window. I thought I was going to die.'

'We went back yesterday to rescue some personal belongings from the boot, a couple of photo albums, clothes, and my laptop, but they had all been stolen. My laptop had all of our photos on.

'We have put a £5000 reward up for the return of the photos and laptop.'

Tony is suffering from shock and hypothermia at the moment from having over an hour on the roof.'

It took nearly an hour and 15 firefighters to get the couple to dry land

The incident happened on a lane near Danbury, Chelmsford, Essex at 00.13 yesterday morning.

As
a police helicopter used its searchlights, firefighters had to use an 
inflatable boat to rescue the men and row the fathers back to dry land.

A
spokesman from Essex Fire and Rescue Service told MailOnline yesterday: 'A fire 
crew found the men on their car in the flooded road at 00.13 this 
morning and took them to safety.'

The couple, from Maldon in Essex, first hit the headlines in 1999 when they became the first British same-sex couple to be named on their children's birth certificates.

Twins Aspen and Saffron were born to a surrogate mother in California.

Following
a ruling by an American court, they became the first British children 
to be registered as having two fathers and no mother.

Four years later, the Drewitt-Barlows used the same egg donor and a different surrogate to have another child, Orlando.

In 2010 the couple welcomed their fourth and fifth children into the world. Twin boys Dallas and Jasper were born to the same surrogate mother who carried Orlando.

The couple, who have made millions from cosmetic research, entered into a civil partnership in 2006.

The couple sold their clinical testing business in 1998 and found themselves swamped by same-sex couples seeking advice.

So with Tony’s clinical expertise, they set up the British Surrogacy Centre in Maldon, Essex, in February 2011, where they were able to share their surrogacy knowledge with others.

Last year, the couple, who have made 
millions from cosmetic research, were accused of fabricating the test 
results in clinical trials.

They were also accused of lying to an ethics committee by saying that 
Barrie was a nurse when he did not hold the appropriate qualifications.

Euroderm Research, which the couple ran, went into liquidation in March 2008. The company conducted tests for dermatological and cosmetic products.

The couple were cleared of all charges at Southwark Crown Court last year.

The couple would like to have another daughter to add to the family and take their total up to six children.
