An artist from Wales has become the latest face of the ‘NHS refugees’ forced to flee to England to get decent healthcare.

Mariana Robinson, 60, has a life-threatening pancreatic condition and needs a biopsy before it can be diagnosed and the correct treatment given.

But the Labour-run Health Service in Wales has left her waiting for months before she can even see a consultant.

Mariana Robinson, 60, from Wales, has a life-threatening pancreatic condition and is demanding the right to be treated on the NHS in England

In desperation she has been forced to borrow from friends to afford the fees to see a private doctor in Bristol, and now she is demanding the right to be treated on the NHS in England.

The Mail revealed two weeks ago that longer waiting times and poorer access to drugs mean thousands of Welsh patients are now flocking across the border to be treated in English hospitals.

The number of Welsh cancer patients doing so has quadrupled from just 3,471 a decade ago to 15,450 last year.

Mrs Robinson has now written to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who runs the NHS in England, to plead for his help.

She wrote: ‘Without timely NHS consultation, hundreds if not thousands of Welsh patients, particularly those on the borders, are either paying privately, changing their addresses, moving house or dying before they even get on a waiting list.’

The scandal was brought up in the Commons yesterday by Tory MP David Davies, who described his constituent Mrs Robinson as an ‘NHS refugee’.

The artist has a condition where only 10 per cent of her pancreas remains which, if it further deteriorates, could leave her with type 1 diabetes.

She lives in Llandogo in Monmouthshire, south-east Wales - just a couple of miles from the English border.

A private consultant in Bristol her that he would only be able to diagnose her condition after a biopsy - but her local NHS organisation, Aneurin Bevan health board, said it would not pay for the procedure in an English hospital.

She has been waiting since last October to even be given a date to see a consultant in Wales.

‘It has cost me £3,000 so far and I have had to borrow money from friends,’ she told the Mail. ‘I need regular tests and I am having to pay for them. I need a biopsy.

‘I am not well and I could do without all this hassle. The longer it takes, the more worried I am. I still have not seen a consultant.’

Mrs Robinson, who also has severe bowel problems, said she would only have to wait five or six weeks in England.

‘I blame the Labour-run assembly and the way it has squandered money on other projects and now have no money left,’ she said. ‘It looks as if the Welsh NHS is bankrupt, which is why they’re stalling people.

‘I live right on the border and Bristol is my nearest hospital and has the speciality I require. But they won’t pay for my treatment there - it’s monstrous.

‘There is absolutely no choice in Wales - you don’t know who you’re going to see, when or where.’

During Prime Minister’s questions yesterday, Mr Davies said: ‘My constituent Mariana Robinson is seeking the right to be treated by the English-run NHS.

During Prime Minister's questions yesterday, David Cameron accused Labour leader Ed Miliband of 'laughing' at the failings of the Welsh NHS

‘Would you investigate what can be done to help her and other NHS refugees who are seeking the higher standards and lower waiting times which are being delivered by this Government?’

Amid raucous scenes in the Commons, David Cameron accused Labour leader Ed Miliband of ‘laughing’ at the failings of the Welsh NHS.

‘Frankly what is happening to our NHS in Wales is a scandal and it is a scandal that is entirely the responsibility of the Labour Party who are running the Welsh Assembly government,’ he said.

‘They made the decision to cut NHS spending by 8 per cent in Wales. As a result they have not met an A&E target since 2009. I don’t know why Mr Miliband is laughing - it’s not funny, the state of the NHS in Wales.

‘If he had any gumption, if he had any backbone, he would get hold of the First Minister in Wales and he would tell him to start investing in the NHS in Wales.’

The Welsh NHS is worse than that in England because, unlike the Coalition which protected health spending in England, the devolved Labour-run government decided to cut it.

During Prime Minister's Questions, David Cameron said: 'What is happening to our NHS in Wales is a scandal and it is a scandal that is entirely the responsibility of the Labour Party who are running the Welsh Assembly government'

In addition, Welsh Labour health ministers rejected Tony Blair’s target regime and the introduction of private sector provision, both of which are credited with bringing down waiting times.

Almost 50 per cent of Welsh cancer patients must wait six weeks or more for vital scans and tests compared with a 1 per cent figure in England.

The exodus to England is also fuelled by a lack of access to the National Cancer Drugs Fund, which funds treatments rejected by the NHS or awaiting approval.

Last night Mr Davies said: ‘Mariana Robinson is one of a large number of patients contacting me, not satisfied with the standard of treatment on the NHS in Wales, and want the right to be treated by the Coalition-run NHS in England.

‘That’s not a reflection on doctors and nurses in Wales, it’s a reflection of the fact that Labour have failed to run the Health Service properly, with longer waiting times, and less access to cancer drugs. People are desperate to leave and be treated in England.’
