The South Beach, Florida, mansion once owned by Italian designer Gianni Versace - and the place he was fatally shot - is headed for the auction block.

The extravagant ten-bedroom home, known as Casa Casuarina, was originally built in 1930 and features a 54-foot long mosaic pool 
lined with 24-karat gold, numerous frescos, ornate 
statues, arched doorways and an open air courtyard.

Fisher Auction Company is handling the sale, which is scheduled for September 17.

Sold! Gianni Versace's former home in South Beach, known by most as Casa Casuarina, was sold at auction today to the firm behind fashion label Jordache for $41.5million

Design marvel: Though the designer behind Villa by Barton G, refurbished the 23,000 square foot space, the style is very much in keeping with the lavish tastes of its former owner

Palatial: Peter Loftin, a telecom entrepreneur, bought the mansion in 2000 and resided there before its conversion into a boutique hotel in 2009

The 23,000-square-foot mansion had 
previously been listed for $125million, before the price was slashed in 
November to $100million, and again in May to $75million.

In 1997, the 50-year-old Versace was 
killed in front of the property by a man who later committed suicide. 
Tourists can still routinely be spotted taking photos in front of the 
house.

The property had been operating as a ten-room boutique hotel but had closed.

The
 house - whose most recent owner was telecoms magnate Peter Loftin - had
 its asking price cut by $50million after failing to find a buyer for 
more than a year.

He initially asked $125million for 
the property, making it the most expensive house on the market when it 
was first put up for sale a year ago.

Bargain! The mansion had previously been listed for $125million, before the price was slashed in November to $100million, and again in May to $75million. Its last asking price before auction was $50million

Expansion: The home was totally remodelled by Versace himself after he fell in love with the property

Unique: There are not many homes as utterly lavish as the house where Versace lived until his death

Pool: But only an extravagant multi-millionaire could afford to buy the Miami Beach mansion

Dark past: It was outside this house where legendary designer Versace was killed by a lone gunman

But in November he was forced to take $25million off the asking price, and he then lowered it by another $25million six months later.

Mr
 Loftin bought the luxury mansion in 2000, three years after Versace's 
murder, and converted the residence into a boutique hotel and private 
club in 2009.

Those who have toured the incredible 
property maintain that the once gold-lined swimming pool and museum quality 
frescoes are just a few of the lavish features that contribute to the 
hefty price tag.

In fact, such is its value, property experts refer to the luxurious villa as a 'trophy property'.

Boutique: The Versace motif remains on the floor of one of the hotel suites, a tribute to the designer who spent $33million renovating and expanding the property after he bought it in 1992

Prints and patterns: The villa was originally built in the 1930s by architect Alden Freeman as an homage to the oldest existing house in the western hemisphere in Santo Domingo

Lavish: The hotel still features the murals and frescoes painted on the walls and ceilings by Mr Versace, a detail that contributes to the hefty price tag

Ocean view: Villa by Barton G looks out onto the Atlantic from its Miami Beach location, an exclusive section of the South Beach strip

A step in the wrong direction: Mr Versace was tragically killed at the entrance to Casa Casuarina in 1997 by Andrew Cunanan who committed suicide shortly after

The now legendary Italian designer 
bought Casa Casuarina in 1992 for just under $10million after supposedly passing by and falling in love with it.

Originally built in the 1930s by architect Alden Freeman, the Miami Beach property was somewhat dilapidated until Versace invested $33million into restoring and improving it.

Once an architect himself, the 
flamboyant designer added a 6,100-square-foot south wing and a 54-foot pool 
lined with 24 karat gold.

Grandeur: The couturier added a 6,100-square-foot south wing to the property and covered the courtyard in thousands upon thousands of individual mosaic tiles

Guest suite? The property cost Mr Versace $10million and though he plugged $33million of his own money into its renovation, after his death his family made a quick sale for only $20million to its most recent owner

Residential palace: The one-acre property features ten bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, seven fireplaces, a garage for 12 cars and a guesthouse

frescoes were painted across the property's walls and ceilings.

Icon: Missed by the fashion world, the late Gianni Versace was once an architect

Indeed it was Versace's pride 
and joy until the fateful June day of 1997 when Andrew Cunanan 
assassinated him in cold blood on the very steps of the house.

When Donatella Versace scrambled to sell
 off the designer's assets, Mr Loftin gained from a quick bargain and 
bought the villa for a cool $20million.

After residing there himself for a 
number of years, he turned the opulent property into a boutique hotel.

The property is now known as Villa
 by Barton G after the events impresario Barton G Weiss who renovated and re-styled it .

Nowadays, according to the hotel's website, the decor 'takes up style where fashion designer Gianni Versace left off.'

Boasting 23,400 square feet, the ornate 
house includes seven fireplaces, a guest house and a parking garage 
large enough for a dozen cars, and all within a one acre plot.

For the past three years hotel guests have enjoyed the surrounding attractions of Miami's historic Art Deco district while re-energizing from the day poolside or in one of two of the residence's lounges.
