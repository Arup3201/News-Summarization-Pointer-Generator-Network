Scent off: Justin Bieber with one of his fragrances. Elizabeth Arden has said its 28 per cent revenue drop is partly down to the poor performance of the singer's scents

From the Pope to reality TV star Joey Essex, it seems that most public figures have them.

But the allure of the celebrity scent seems to be waning with beauty giant Elizabeth Arden seeing a 28 per cent revenue drop because of a decline in their sales.

Furthermore, the company said the slump, which triggered a 25 per cent fall in share price, was largely due to the fragrances of pop stars Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift.

The cosmetic firm said its quarterly pre-tax loss to the end of June was £48m – the worst in the company’s 104 year history.

Wild child Bieber, who last week pleaded guilty to charges of careless driving and resisting arrest, had launched three perfumes by his 20th birthday in March this year.

His most recent scent, The Key (following on from Someday launched in 2011 and Girlfriend in 2012) is a ‘fruity floral’ mix of pink jasmine and sweet osmanthus blossom, which promises to ‘channel Justin’s authentic voice that inspires his millions of dedicated fans to believe – to believe in themselves, to believe in their connection with Justin, and most of all, to believe that their dreams will come true.’

However, with the singer’s delinquent behaviour and increasing brushes with the law - last month he pleaded no contest to a vandalism charge in California - it would appear his popularity, in terms of perfume at least, could be falling.

Meanwhile 24-year-old Swift’s scent Wonderstruck and its follow-on Wonderstruck Enchanted, is also creating big losses for Elizabeth Arden despite being on sale the UK for just £13.50.

The American singer says her products capture ‘the moment when you instantly feel a connection to someone, but then there’s that feeling of being completely enamoured — enchanted — when you know a little more about that someone and still feel that strong connection.’

This will hopefully be achieved thanks to a ‘charming and sparkling surprise of vibrant fruits, kissed by a bouquet of soft petals and a touch of sweet indulgence.’

Each year, more than 500 celebrity perfumes are released into an already highly saturated market, which began with the launch of Elizabeth Taylor’s White Diamonds for Elizabeth Arden in 1991 and went on to sell 60million bottles.

Sales were at the highest in 2011, when Bieber’s Someday was the biggest selling perfume in America – with one bottle sold every minute in the first week of its launch.

Slump: Taylor Swift’s scent Wonderstruck and its follow-on Wonderstruck Enchanted, is also creating big losses for Elizabeth Arden despite being on sale the UK for just £13.50

In addition to Bieber and Swift, Elizabeth Arden owns the brands of Britney Spears, Jennifer Aniston, Mariah Carey and rapper Nicki Minaj.

The company, which is having to cut 175 jobs because of the slump, said on Tuesday that half the loss was due to such products, adding in a statement: ‘The decline in sales of celebrity fragrances, particularly the Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift fragrances, was steeper than anticipated.’

Other celebrities with their own perfumes include former X-Factor judge Tulisa, Victoria and David Beckham, Madonna, Kylie Minogue and One Direction.

Most of the cast of The Only Way is Essex also have their own brands, including Joey Essex’s My Girl and Sam Faiers’ La Bella.

In 2012, it emerged that Pope Benedict XVI has commissioned celebrity Italian perfume maker Silvana Casoli, who created scents for Sting and Madonna, to create his own personal cologne.

Around of 75% of Elizabeth Arden’s sales come from perfumes, compared to its rival Estee Lauder which relies more on cosmetics.
