Actress Naomi Watts believes Princess 
Diana gave her ‘permission’ from beyond the grave to  play her in a new 
film about her love life.

The
British-Australian actress,  44, admits the claim will sound unusual, 
but says the experience left her feeling more comfortable in the title 
role of the movie Diana.

Playing the Princess was, says Watts, her hardest ever role.

Call from beyond: Naomi Watts found herself asking for 'permission' to play Princess Diana in the new biopic

‘I
kept wondering to myself “Would she like it?”,’ she reveals. ‘So I 
found myself constantly asking for her permission to carry on.  I had 
saturated myself with Diana and her life and I felt this enormous 
responsibility of playing this iconic woman.

‘It
felt like I was spending a lot  of time with her. There was one  
particular moment when I felt her permission was granted. That won’t 
sound right in print, I know.’

The
blonde actress, whose previous film roles have included The Impossible 
and Mulholland Drive, feared that she was not physically similar enough 
to Diana, who died in 1997.

‘There was a lot of hesitation on my part before I agreed to do it,’ she says in The Mail on Sunday’s Event magazine today.

‘Obviously I was taking on one of the most famous women of my  time, and an awful lot of pressure comes with that.

'She (Diana) had a very expressive face. And she had that sideways smile we all remember, and those big eyes and a strong, athletic walk,' said Naomi

‘You
want to get it right, and everybody is going to have an opinion  on the
film and how she should be portrayed. It’s very daunting.

‘But
then I also knew the best roles come with a risk. In the end, I decided
that I couldn’t not do it. This was a story that had to be told – it’s 
an important story – but it  was definitely the hardest thing  I’ve ever
done. It’s as close as I ever want to get to a character.’

The
biopic, which opens next month, focuses on the final two years of 
Diana’s life and includes details of her relationships following her 
divorce from Prince Charles – notably with Dodi Fayed and with heart 
surgeon Dr Hasnat Khan.

Dr 
Khan, played by Lost actor Naveen Andrews, met Diana in 1995 and their 
relationship is understood to have grown very intense – even talking of 
marriage together and starting a new life in Australia.

Producer
Robert Bernstein has explained how the film-makers approached the 
relationship sensitively after discussions with Hasnat and his family.

He
said: ‘The way we are treating the relationship is one of a romantic 
and tender nature, in keeping  with how we feel about Diana  and her 
life.

‘It’s a very 
aspirational, sympathetic portrait and not voyeuristic. Our sense of 
their relationship  was that it was very spiritual and sensitive, as 
well as difficult,  obviously. We are handling it very sensitively.’

Watts
adds that her own approach involved a great deal of research, including
meeting many of Diana’s friends. ‘It meant I could pick up little 
details and make sure I was doing it right,’ she says.

‘People
were unanimous in their praise of her extraordinary sense  of humour 
and her cheekiness.  They also all said she had quite a rebellious 
streak, something I always admire.’

Watts
believes  her own experience of losing her father at a young age helped
her to empathise with Diana’s sons Princes William and Harry.

Speaking
of the Princes, she adds: ‘I would hate to upset them. I hope they feel
good about it. It’s a  piece of history we’re all interested in and at 
some point the story had  to be told.’

Diana’s
secret affair with heart surgeon Hasnat Khan ended when they both 
realised that they couldn’t live a ‘normal’ life, says the film’s 
screenwriter, Stephen Jeffreys.

‘I
think Diana was very attracted to Hasnat because of what he did. He had
wonderful surgeon’s hands and eyes and she was tremendously excited to 
be near someone who was doing good work.

'However, in order to do that good work he couldn’t possibly be in the eye of a media storm.

‘When
you are doing 12-hour-long heart operations you can’t come out of that 
and then have a her towards him meant they couldn’t stay together.

'I
think that it was a relationship, which I’m sure we’ve all experienced,
where you go on longer with it than rationally you should.

‘You kind of know it’s not going to work and there are clear reasons why, but the heart overrules the head.’

Jeffreys,
who based his script on journalist Kate Snell’s book, Diana: Her Last 
Love, and his own extensive research, believes there was a chance that, 
had she lived, Diana and Khan would have got back together.

‘There
was an escape plan that they would go to South Africa or Australia when
the boys were older. But in the end I think it was a love affair that 
was defeated by practicalities.’

Jeffreys’
screenplay centres on the relationship between Khan and Diana. Her more
publicised romance with Dodi Fayed, who died in the same Paris car 
crash that killed her on August 31, 1997, only features briefly at the 
end of the film.

‘Our 
view is, that relationship is less important – it was a summer romance; 
having looked at what she said, you feel that it was a bit of fun for 
her.’
