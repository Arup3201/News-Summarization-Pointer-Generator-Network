A tender picture showing an Italian man cradling his frail grandmother who has Alzheimer's has touched the hearts of thousands of people in just a few days.

Gianuluca Murisciano posted a picture on his Facebook page of him holding his 87-year-old grandmother Antonia in his arms on December 31, and since then it has received over 400,000 likes. It has also been shared 37,000 times. 

In a caption that accompanies the picture Mr Murisciano writes that the moment was 'the best of my life' despite being heartbreakingly sad. His grandmother's condition is so bad, she often doesn't recognise her grandson, or mistakes him for his brother.

Mr Murisciano goes on to write that he shared the picture 'without shame or fear' to remind people that 'life should always be lived'.

His message for 2015, he wrote, was that people 'always be present' and that they not only 'protect and comfort' those around them, but also keep them 'happy and smiling with us'. 

He told Italian media that his beloved grandmother was not 'crying' in the picture, but was expressing her 'modesty'.

Mr Murisciano said he grew up in his grandparents' home, and it was now time to 'reciprocate' by caring for them where he could.
