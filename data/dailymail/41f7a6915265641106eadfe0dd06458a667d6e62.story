PSG forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic has become Sweden's all-time record goal scorer.

The 32-year-old netted a brace  in Sweden's friendly against Estonia to reach 50 international goals, overtaking Sven Rydell, who scored the last of his 49 goals against Finland in 1932.

After breaking the record, Ibrahimovic took of his shirt to reveal a message for the fans. It read: 'Ni gjorde det mojligt,' or: 'You made it all possible.'

Record holder: Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored his 50th international goal for Sweden after a brace against Estonia

No 1: He has now broken Sven Rydel's record of 49 goals for Sweden, but in double the number of games

1. Zlatan Ibrahimovic - 50 goals in 99 games

2. Sven Rydell - 49 goals in 43 games

3. Gunnar Nordhal - 43 goals in 33 games

4. Henrik Larsson - 37 goals in 106 games

5. Gunnar Gren - 32 goals in 57 games

6. Kennet Andersson - 31 goals in 83 games

7. Marcus Allback - 30 goals in 74 games

8. Martin Dahlin - 29 goals in 60 games

9. Tomas Brolin - 27 goals in 47 games

10. Agne Simonssen - 27 goals in 51 games

After making his international debut in 2001, Ibrahimovic scored his first goal for Sweden in his competitive debut - a 3-0 victory over Azerbaijan in a World Cup qualifier. 

Since then Sweden's enigmatic captain has gone on to score some of the most memorable goals in recent international history.

At the 2004 European Championships the then-Ajax forward scored arguably the goal of the tournament.

An acrobatic effort, the likes of which would become his trademark, found the net against Italy and helped engineer Ibrahimovic a move to Juventus. 

But his most memorable international goal came  in 2012.

Having already put three past a lacklustre England side, Ibrahimovic scored a spectacular 35-yard bicycle kick to embarrass Joe Hart and earn himself the 2013 FIFA Puskas Award for the best goal of the year.

Award: Ibrahimovic won the FIFA Puskas Award for his bicycle kick goal against England in 2012

Sweden's captain broke the record after scoring twice as his side beat Estonia 2-0 in a friendly in Solna.

It was fitting that the 50th goal should be as brazen as the man himself. 

Seb Larsson broke down the right before cutting the ball back. The PSG front-man held off the defender before back-heeling the ball past goalkeeper Sergei Pareiko. Ibrahimovic was then booked for removing his shirt in celebration.
