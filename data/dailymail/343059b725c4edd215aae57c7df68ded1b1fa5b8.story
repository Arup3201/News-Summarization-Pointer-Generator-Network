The UK Independence Party has benefited from a surge in membership in the last 12 months as Conservative  numbers have dipped, it emerged yesterday.

Ukip now has 32,500 members – up from 19,500 last January.

Nigel Farage’s party has been advancing in the polls and has been tipped to beat the Conservatives in the European elections to be held in May.

Conservative constituency membership has almost halved since David Cameron became leader in 2005 – from 253,600 to just 134,000.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage has hailed a rise of two thirds in his party's membership in the past 12 months

Nigel Farage's eurosceptic party said it was finishing 2013 with 32,500 members - up from 19,500 at the start of a year which has seen its profile rise significantly

Mr Farage said Ukip was re-engaging people who had given up on politics.

He
 added: ‘Many of our members are those who have never been a member of 
any political party before, but who see that it is Ukip who is 
challenging the establishment on issues such as open-door immigration, 
grammar schools and green taxes.’

If
 Ukip has a similar surge in membership over the coming  year, it could 
overtake the Liberal Democrats in its grassroots’ support.

The number of Lib Dems is at 43,000, more than a third lower than the 65,000 it had in 2010.Support for Labour has also slipped back to 187,537, down from when Ed Miliband became leader in 2010.

Ukip chairman Steve Crowther said: 'The narrative in Westminster seems to be that falling party membership is inevitable.

'Well in Ukip’s case the opposite is true: our membership is growing faster than ever.

'In May alone, the month that the council elections were held, Ukip membership went up by 2,500. We will now aim to continue that momentum and growth as we head into next year’s European Elections and the 2015 general election as well.'

Mr Farage - who has predicted a political 'earthquake' in May when his party is tipped by some to win the election - said it was re-engaging people who had 'given up on politics'.

'Many of our members are those who have never been a member of any political party before but who see that it is Ukip who is challenging the establishment on issues such as open door immigration, grammar schools and green taxes.'
