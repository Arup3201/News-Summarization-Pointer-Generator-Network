An Oregon legislator abruptly stepped down as House Republican leader last month because he feared someone would disclose he had visited a topless bar with colleagues, he has revealed.

Rep. Kevin Cameron, from Salem, admitted he had visited the sleazy bar while on a golfing trip to Palm Springs, California with six other Oregon Republicans in January this year.

The married lawmaker stepped down after hearing rumours that a colleague, who had been forced to resign over a sex scandal a month prior, was threatening to go public with the story.

'I am not proud personally of what I did 
at that point in time,' he told The Oregonian about 
the visit.

Speaking to the newspaper, he pointed out that the topless bar scandal was only part of the reason he quit his role on July 18.

His swift exit also came after his colleague, Rep. Matt Wingard, resigned as deputy leader in June and dropped his bid for another stint in office after a former aide accused him of sexual misconduct.

Wingard, who had also been on the Palm Springs trip, allegedly plied Samantha Berrier, then 20, with alcohol and forced her into an unwanted sexual relationship.

Accuser: Samantha Berrier, then 20, said Wingard gave her alcohol and forced her into a sexual relationship

Wingard has denied giving her alcohol 
while she was underage and claims that they had a short consensual relationship while she 
worked for him in 2009.

Cameron told Wingard that if he did not 
step down and pull out of the bid, Cameron would have to make a public 
demand that he do so, The Oregonian reported.

After Wingard stepped down, Cameron said he heard rumours the snubbed colleague was going to go public about his visit to a topless bar.

He said the Wingard scandal coupled with 'family and business pressures' that demanded his attention led to his resignation. He was replaced by Rep. Andy Olson of Albany.

Cameron took the Palm Springs trip with Wingard, House co-Speaker Bruce Hanna and Reps
Tim Freeman, Vic Gilliam, Patrick Sheehan and Matt Wand. All bar Wingard and Sheehan are married.

Several of the men told The Oregnian it was merely 'a personal 
vacation with friends'.

The men stayed at a $1 million four-bedroom, four-bath home house owned by Gilliam and his wife.

They had dinner together before heading to the bar featuring topless dancers, although they have refused to reveal who came up with the bright idea.

Hanna said their visit to the bar was no one's business - although he admitted he did regret it.

'Asking me a question like that would be
like me asking you what you wore as swimwear or not on your last 
vacation and how that affected your ability to do your job,' he told The Oregonian.

There is no indication that state or campaign money was involved on the holiday.

Just a few months later, Cameron learned about the relationship between Wingard and Berrier after the young woman 'poured her heart out' to Rachel Lucas, from the Washington County Republicans.

Lucas emailed Cameron who called her the next day. The allegations became public a month later and Wingard stepped down as deputy leader.

After Cameron told him to step down and Wingard pulled his name from the ballot, Cameron said he heard rumours Wingard was threatening to tell about the men's trip to the topless bar.

Wingard did not comment on the claims.

The embarrassing details surface as the Republicans are attempting to win a majority in the House, taking back control, which has been evenly split over the past two years.

Cameron had been in the seat since 2005, and had been leader since January 2011.

Despite his resignation, Cameron is continuing with his bid for a fifth term in District 19, which covers part of South Salem, Aumsville and Turner.
