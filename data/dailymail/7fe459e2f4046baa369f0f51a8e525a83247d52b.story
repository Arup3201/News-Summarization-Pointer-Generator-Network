Killer: Matthew Webster, 30, fatally shot Anna Alger, 31, after getting into an argument because he ran a red light and almost hit her car

A man has been arrested for shooting and killing a woman in a road rage incident in St. Albans, Vermont, on Wednesday.

The 31-year-old victim from Highgate, Anna Alger, who leaves behind a young daughter, was found with gunshot wounds in her back and head.

The
horrific killing happened at about 6pm after the suspect, Matthew Webster, 30, of 
Swanton, ran a red light at North Main and Lower Newton Street and 
nearly hit her car as she was coming off Lower Newton Road.

Police say Alger followed Webster and
when they got out of their cars to confront each other further up the 
road, about 400 yards from the St Albans Messenger building, he shot her
multiple times.

Alger was taken to Northwestern Medical Center by Amcare Ambulance where she died.

Webster was arrested a short distance away with the gun police say was used in the shooting.

Alger, who was a 2000 graduate of Missisquoi Valley Union High School, leaves behind a daughter who currently attends Highgate Elementary School.

Alger, who was employed at Peerless Clothing Co. in St. Albans, was engaged to her colleague, Patrick Dalley, according to her Facebook page.

Victim: Anna Alger, 31, died after being shot multiple times by Webster in a senseless road rage incident in St Albans, Vermont, on Wednesday evening

Road rage: Police have cordoned off the vehicles involved in the roadside shooting on North Main Street in St. Albans, in which Alger was killed. It is unclear which car belongs to whom

In court: Matthew Webster is led into court in St. Albans on Thursday. He pleaded not guilty to the charges of shooting and killing Anna Alger

Police cordoned off the area, which involved three cars - a gray Kia, a dark blue Ford Escort and an orange Subaru hatchback.

The front driver’s side tire on the 
Kia was flat, and the right turn signal was still blinking several hours
after the shooting. A door of the Escort was open.

What appeared to be shell casings and blood were visible near the cars.

Lt. Ron Hoague of the St. Albans Police Department said the incident was ‘pretty shocking’.

‘I've
been a police officer for 23 years now and I've seen violence of all 
different kinds, but even after all that, it's still shocking to see 
something like that happen to two people who seemed not to know each 
other until they met.’

Arrested: Police officers caught Webster not long after the incident occurred

Deadly route: Alger followed Webster down Main Street in St Albans after he almost hit her car. When they stopped their cars to confront one another he shot her

Debris: Personal effects are seen scattered on the ground in the wake of Wednesday's shooting

Crime scene: Vermont State Police investigate the location of the shooting in which mother of one, Anna Alger, died

Deadly wounds: The 31-year-old victim was found with bullet holes in her back and head

Personal issues: Police say problems at home may have pushed Webster to the breaking point and a complete stranger - Anna Alger - was caught in the middle

A witness, Nathan Elwood, said he heard the gunshots and found the woman with the deadly wounds.

‘You could see two bullet holes through the back that came out the back and it looked like she had been shot in the head,’ Elwood told WCAX.

Another witness, Kyle Gagne, filmed the arrest and posted it on Facebook, according to the Burlington Free Press.

A
woman identifying herself as Jill Marie Longley posted a comment 
saying: 'I saw the man and the woman standing outside of their cars and 
the seemed to be arguing.

'He started toward her and she put her hands up
and said something along the lines of ‘no, don’t'. I had been driving 
by at this time, and when I went past, I heard a shot.'

Witness: Nathan Elwood heard the gunshots and found Alger with bullet holes in her body. Another witness says she heard Alger plead with Webster to spare her life before he shot her

'Pretty shocking': Lt. Ron Hoague of the St. Albans Police Department says the incident was shocking because the two did not know each other

Police say Webster's wife was following her husband in another car and witnessed part of the incident.

They say problems at home may have pushed Webster to the breaking point and a complete stranger was caught in the middle.

Webster was cited in September 2012 for negligent operations after he crashed his car into another vehicle at the intersection of Woods Hill Road and Route 7 in Swanton.

According to the Vermont State Police press release, Webster was reported to be driving recklessly prior to the crash, passing two other vehicles before crashing into a third he attempted to overtake.

Webster was expected to be in court Thursday morning, where he will face second-degree homicide charges.
