Trisha after she joined ABC in Australia

When I was in my late twenties and living in Sydney, Australia, I had a job offer that ended up changing my life in more ways than one.

I'd moved to Australia in 1985 after meeting and marrying the politician Robert Nestdale. I began working in PR but then, when my marriage disintegrated, I started work as a reporter with ethnic TV channel SBS.

I'd wanted to be a journalist for years while I was an air hostess in the Middle East, so I'd already taken short courses and done some voluntary work at radio stations. 

My job at SBS, my first in television, really suited me and I very much enjoyed working in such a creative environment. So much so that after a year there I applied to be a reporter on a show called The 7.30 Report on ABC, a much bigger TV station with a huge national audience.

I had an interview, and then a few days later I was asked to meet the MD David Hill. 'Great,' I thought, 'I must be close to getting the job.' To my surprise, after a short chat with David he announced I was going to be Australia's first black TV presenter! I was shocked. I'd gone for a reporter's job, and now this!

But Australia in the 1980s wasn't as racially tolerant as it is now, so when the news got out it stirred up a huge media storm. Everyone had an opinion as to why a Pommie black female was on Australian TV.

Surely if a person of colour was going to be on television it should be someone from the indigenous Aborigine population?

I was living with my new fiancé, TV producer Mark Grieve, at the time and I remember having to lie on

But even though I loved my job and put 110 per cent into it, it didn't stop the sniping. In fact, the negative press only died down when Michael Parkinson wrote an article in a British newspaper accusing the Australians of being intolerant, which was picked up worldwide.

I worked on The 7.30 Report for a couple of years before setting up my own production company to make a chat show called Live It Up, which was then noticed by Anglia Television in Britain.

They were looking to replace Vanessa Feltz when she left her talk show, and they offered me my own show. Even though I was living in Australia, had two young girls and was about to marry my third husband, I leapt at the chance to get into TV in Britain, so I moved back to the UK and Trisha took off.

Now I'm doing my show in America, The Trisha Show, and I think that huge media storm helped toughen me up for the future, while the job at ABC set my career in motion.

I'm so glad it's still continuing - 26 years in the business is a huge achievement. I've fulfilled most of my ambitions now, but I'd still like to direct a movie. You never know what's around the corner. 

The Trisha Show will air here on 5USA next month. Trisha is patron of the Norwich Home-Start family charity; www.homestartnorwich.org.
