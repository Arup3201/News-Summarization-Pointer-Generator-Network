A riot broke out at a juvenile correctional facility in South Central Florida Saturday night over a Cup Noodles deal gone wrong.

According to Polk County Sheriff's spokesman Carrie Eleazer, two groups at the all-male facility Avon Park Youth Academy in Polk, Florida were engaging in a low-stakes game of basketball.

A group from St Petersburg was playing a group from Orlando. At stake: three packages of instant ramen.

But when the St Petersburg team lost, they refused to give over the the instant noodles, sparking a brawl between the two teams.

That fight started chaos at the private detention facility maintained by the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice, but run by the private correction company G4S which houses 138 juveniles.

Police were notified and the staff were immediately called out of the building since they are not equipped to deal with violence at the compounds.

'Employees are not allowed to have any specialty equipment to include pepper spray, which would have allowed them to deal with the fight before it escalated to a riot,' Eleazer said.

The riot wasn't contained until 12am the next day. Eleazer estimates that the rioting juveniles caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage.

Some juveniles gained access to an office building holding their records and set it on fire as well as setting a dumpster on fire. Eighteen of the 20 buildings on the compound were heavily damaged.

By the time authorities from several law enforcement agencies showed up, they were handcuffing all of the teens in 'flex' handcuffs.

None of the juveniles escaped. Seven detainees were injured in the riot including one broken leg.

Sixty-four of the juveniles were transported to the PCSO South County Jail in Frostproof where they were placed in state custody. They are being separated from the adult inmates. The rest stayed at the academy.

Eleazer says the Sheriff's office is investigating the riot and will be issuing felony charges to those involved.

None of the riot was caught on camera since the facility doesn't have surveillance monitors and the academy is in a rural area on the Avon Park Air Force Range.

The juveniles housed at the academy are considered 'moderate risk'. Juveniles sent to the academy are between the ages of 16 and 18 and stay an average of 270 days.
