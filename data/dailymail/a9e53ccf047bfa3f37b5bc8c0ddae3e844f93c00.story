Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou had hoped to open the first of his new supermarkets on the ground floor of his latest hotel complex but has been scuppered by local planning chiefs

The founder of easyJet is looking for a new location for his first budget supermarket after plans to open it Croydon, south London were thwarted by council planning bosses.

Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou wanted to launch his new 'easyFoodstore' chain on the ground floor of his new building, which is also set to become the latest in his easyHotel empire.

But the idea was ruled out at an early stage by local planning chiefs, who insisted the building was outside the borough's 'retail zone'.

Croydon will instead host a 'mock-up' store which will be used to test the idea on focus groups before it is potentially launched in other less-affluent areas of the capital.

Peckham, Woolwich, Catford and Thornton Heath have been mooted as potential locations for the first store, which could open as early as the end of this year if the response is good.

A spokesman for easyGroup insisted the plans were still at an early stage and no store was likely to open until the group had seen the response of focus groups to the trial store.

EasyGroup, run by Sir Stelios, owns the brand which is now licenced to a range of businesses, including a car hire company, an office space rental firm, a hotel chain and a network of gyms.

He remains the largest single shareholder in easyJet, which he founded in 1995.

Annoucing his plans to open supermarkets last year, he said: 'I have a feeling that there is a gap in the food retail market – a niche below some of the current budget operators such as Aldi and Lidl.'

He said of the store: 'Concentrating on affordable, basic "no-brand-name" packet and tinned foods at bargain prices, easyFoodstore underlines the need for additional reliable day-to-day provision of basic foodstuffs.'

He then set out his hopes that the former MetLife building the company had taken over in Croydon would combine the brand's hotels, offices, a gym and the first of his supermarkets.

The new supermarket was earmarked to open on the ground floor of the converted MetLife building in Croydon (pictured), which is due to be turned into an easyGym, easyHotel and easyOffice

But it emerged today that planners rejected his bid to install the new shop in the area, forcing him to look elsewhere.

The news came after Sir Stelios announced plans to list his budget hotel chain on the stock market on Friday.

His easyHotel business, which currently runs 20 hotels, wants to raise £60m in the move, the first flotation the tycoon has attempted since his airline floated in 2000.

The firm currently runs two hotels it owns, as well as having 17 franchised units. It operates in cities such as London, Dubai, and Johannesburg as well as Sir Stelios's native Cyprus.

Sir Stelios said: 'I see easyHotel as one of the best, most natural extensions of the easy brand from the airline. Easyhotel is raising money to accelerate growth at a much faster rate than I could have grown it as a private company.'
