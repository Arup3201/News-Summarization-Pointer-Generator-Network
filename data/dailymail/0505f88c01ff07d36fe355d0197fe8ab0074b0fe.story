Gabriel Aubry has been arrested for battery following a 'brutal' Thanksgiving Day brawl with Olivier Martinez.

The
model - who is the father of Halle Berry's four-year-old daughter Nahla
- reportedly attacked the actress' French fiance Olivier on Thursday 
morning when he was dropping the child back at Halle's house - but came 
off worse in the fight.

Police were called to the home and Gabriel
was taken to hospital for his injuries after suffering a broken rib, bruises to the face and a possible more serious head injury, TMZ reports.

Tense: Halle and Olivier, also pictured on Wednesday, recently lost a custody battle to take Nahla to his native France

Olivier has a possible broken hand and
neck injuries. He arrived at the same Los Angeles hospital for 
treatment as Gabriel around an hour after him, according to the website.

The drama went down inside Halle's home at around 10am after Gabriel dropped off their daughter Nahla in a custodial handover.

Martinez apparently approached Aubry and said: 'We have to move on,' - a reference to the recent custody battle which blocked Halle from moving to France with Nahla.

But Aubry responded by allegedly pushing Martinez and throwing a punch at his face.

Sources told TMZ the fight was 
'brutal' with the website describing a blow-by-blow account of
the melee: 'Olivier blocked [Gabriel's punch] and the punch 
struck him in the shoulder instead... Gabriel then pushed 
Olivier to the ground, a struggle ensued, ending when Olivier pinned 
Gabriel to the ground.'

In another twist, a judge has just 
issued an emergency protective order - meaning Gabriel has to stay 100 
yards away from Halle, Olivier and Nahla.

Martinez, who has apparently become
increasingly bitter during the custody battle, is said to be keen to 
press charges, TMZ reports.

Protective: Gabriel was concerned his relationship with his daughter would be damaged if she moved to France

A source told gossip website TMZ: 'Gabriel went nuts,' in front of Halle and other witnesses. It is not clear whether Nahla witnessed the fight.

However, details about the argument are unclear because both men were speaking in French.

Gabriel,
a French-Canadian model who lives and works in Los Angeles, had petitioned the
court to stop Halle's plans to move to France.

He argued it would give him limited access to his 
daughter, while the Cloud Atlas actress countered the privacy laws are 
stronger in France and would keep Nahla safe from the paparazzi.

Halle, 46
- who split with Gabriel in 2010 - and Olivier, had put their wedding 
plans on hold while the actress focused on her custody battle.

Just 24 hours earlier, Halle, Oliver and Gabriel all attended an early Thanksgiving celebration in Los Angeles with Nahla.

While Halle and Olivier picked up Nahla from school and took her to the party, her father took her home with him on Wednesday.

The Oscar winning actress looked 
strained as she left the event carrying a feathered headpiece and jacket
belonging to her daughter.

In her custody battle, Halle claimed 
that Los Angeles was not the ideal place for her daughter to grow up, 
due to the glare of the paparazzi.

Nahla in the middle: The child has been at the centre of the bitter feud

She has insisted that it was not an attempt to keep Nahla's model father away from her.

The Monster's Ball actress made a rare comment about her custody battle with Gabriel to InStyle magazine this month.

'There is turbulence, but this too shall pass,' she said.

Halle
and Gabriel split in April 2010 after more than four years of dating, 
and she soon began a relationship with actor Olivier. They confirmed 
their engagement in March.
