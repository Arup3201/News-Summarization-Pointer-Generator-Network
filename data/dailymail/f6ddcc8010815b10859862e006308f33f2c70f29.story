A man has died after falling through a grate on a Brooklyn sidewalk, reports claim.

The victim, believed to be a homeless man in his 30s, was walking down Bedford Avenue at 3pm on Sunday when he stepped on the metal trapdoor, which broke beneath his feet.

He fell 12 feet into the cellar of an abandoned building.

Police were seen carrying a dead body out of the basement, according the the New York Daily News.

The NYPD has yet to confirm the death.

'The thing just opened. He was walking. He wasn't paying attention,' witness Richie McCray, 50, told the Daily News. 

'The thing is loose. And he disappeared.'
