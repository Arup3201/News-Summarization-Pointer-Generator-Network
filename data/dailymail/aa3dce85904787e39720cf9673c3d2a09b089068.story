Barcelona's new coach Luis Enrique has told supporters it will not be a ‘tragedy’ if Luis Suarez misses the start of the season.

The club’s lawyers are hoping that FIFA will allow them to make a ‘fast-track’ appeal to the Court for Arbitration in Sport (CAS) in Lausanne in a bid to lift the ban on the player training with his new team-mates.

But Enrique put on a brave face 
at the club’s Joan Gamper training complex saying: 'It’s not a tragedy. 
It’s not ideal but it does not serve as any excuse. Another player will 
take his place with the Barcelona badge on his shirt and represent the 
club.

'The ideal situation 
is to have all the players at my disposal but we knew that he (Suarez) 
couldn’t train for four months when we signed him. The season is very 
long and there will be time for all players to play.'

Asked
 if the club had compromised its ‘More than a club’ slogan by signing a 
player banned by FIFA Sporting Director Andoni Zubizarreta said: 'The 
philosophy has never been about us claiming to be perfect.

'We
 accept human beings with all their imperfections. People get things 
right and they get things wrong and they can then have the capacity to 
learn from mistakes.

'In the
 history of this club we have had some good days and some bad days. What
 we have always done is learn from our mistakes and turn them into 
positives. I am sure that Luis will be a positive force for this club in
 the future.'

Barcelona’s 
situation is a delicate one because they can only use the fast-track 
appeal process with CAS if Fifa allow them to. If Fifa turn them down 
they would be forced into a much longer appeal process or have to seek 
redress in another court.

Zubizarreta
 said: 'Our lawyers tell us that we have to be very prudent in what we 
say about the matter. We have to give them time to mount the best case 
before we say any more about the issue.'

Lawyers
 working on behalf of the player are hopeful that the independent 
committee that banned Suarez from all football-related activity for four
 months went beyond the limits of its jurisdiction prohibiting him from 
working for his new employer.

They
 will also argue that because the player will need time after his 
four-month ban from training with team-mates to have a pre-season, the 
ban effectively becomes much longer and therefore punishes the player 
and the club more.

In his 
first press conference since Barça’s return to training the Zubizarreta 
also said that the futures of both Xavi Hernandez and Dani Alves 
remained up in the air and defended himself against criticism that he 
had dragged his feet over signing a new centre-back.

Barcelona
 have now gone five years without bringing in a new defender missing out
 on the likes of Javi Martinez, Thiago Silva and most recently David 
Luis along the way.

But
 Zubizarreta said: 'We are working to strengthen the centre of defence –
 but so are 90 percent of Europe’s top clubs. David Luis has been the 
only big movement in the market in this position so far but nothing else
 has happened. We have to look for players who are better than the ones 
we have.'

Midfielder Xavi is
 due back in training on July 24 just before the club spend five days at
 the FA’s St. George’s park. And defender Alves is due back in training 
on August 5 and both player’s future are uncertain.

Enrique said: 'I love Xavi, I’ve spoken to him and if he continues here
 then great.' While Zubizarreta added: 'Alves is one of ours. We will 
talk to him and see where we end up. Xavi and Alves have a contract but 
they have also earned the right to talk openly about their future and 
find the best solution for them.'

Ahead
 of his first pre-season as coach the Barcelona first team Luis Enrique 
was asked about the form of Leo Messi and a squad that last season 
looked bereft of leaders.

He
 said: 'I don’t think Messi is below par. We’ve got a good group here 
and among them is the best player in the world. You can’t choose 
leaders. They appear. I’m the leader of this team and I’m sure from my 
team other leaders will stand up.'

He
 also said that the signing of Suarez when he already has Neymar and 
Messi was a plus and not a problem.

He said: 'The better the players 
they give me the better it is for me. I’m delighted to have them but 
don’t forget about Rafinha and Pedro and the other players that we can 
play in attack. It’s not just about those three.'
