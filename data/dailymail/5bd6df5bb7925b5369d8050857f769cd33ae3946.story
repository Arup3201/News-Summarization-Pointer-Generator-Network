Archie Collicutt, 18, has been jailed for ten years after he admitted raping or sexually assaulting seven underage girls including one as young as 12

A teenager who attacked seven underage girls before threatening to kill them and their families to keep them quiet has been jailed for ten years.

Archie Collicutt, 18, befriended the Oxfordshire girls before sexually assaulting them, including one victim who was just 12 years old.

The attacks all took place between March 2012, when Collicutt was aged just 16, and September 2013 when he was finally caught.

Collicutt was jailed today after admitting rape, sexual assault, sexual activity with a child and  attempted rape of a child under 13 at Oxford Crown Court. 

In March 2012, aged just 16, Collicutt raped a 13-year-old girl and said he would kill her and her family if she told anyone about it.

In another incident in June 2013, Collicutt attempted to rape a 12-year-old girl and again threatened her and her family to stop her telling police.

The teenager, from Wilcote Riding, Finstock, was eventually arrested  in September 2013.

Detective Constable Ian Gibbard said: 'Collicutt deliberately took advantage of young girls, abusing them and threatening them in order to stop them telling anyone.

'We are pleased he took the opportunity to plead guilty and spare the victims from having to come to court, but that in no way makes up for what he did to them.

'I would like to take this opportunity to commend their bravery in coming forward to tell police what had happened to them.

'We will always take any allegations of sexual offences seriously and so I urge anyone who is a victim of offences like these, or knows someone who is, to get in touch and we will help in any way we can.'
