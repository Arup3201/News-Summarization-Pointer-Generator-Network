A Minnesota hospital has offered its ‘deep apologies’ to the family of a stillborn baby boy whose body was found by employees at an industrial laundry company.

The body of the baby, which was stillborn at 22 weeks, horrified workers at the Crothall Laundry in Red Wing when it fell out of a bed sheet on Tuesday afternoon.

Regions Hospital in St. Paul has described the incident as ‘an unfortunate event’ and claims the remains had been wrapped in linens in its morgue and were mistaken for laundry sent out for cleaning.

The Regions Hospital in St. Paul, Minnesota has offered its 'deep apologies' to the family of a stillborn baby boy whose body was found in sheets delivered to an industrial laundry company

The boy, who was stillborn late in the second trimester nearly two weeks ago, still had a tag on its ankle and was wearing a diaper.

Chris Boese, Regions’ chief nursing officer, told The Minneapolis Star-Tribune that the hospital had procedures to prevent such a mishandling, but that they had failed for some reason.

‘We are working to identify the gap in our system, and to make sure this does not happen again,’ said Boese.

The hospital is 'working to' notify the 
infant's family, but Boese said on Wednesday morning that the message had 
not yet been delivered. In addition, Regions has also offered to provide support and counseling to the employees of the linen service.

The hospital delivers 2,500 babies each 
year and about 2 stillborns each month. This is the first time infant 
remains have been lost, said Boese.

A family member of a laundry worker said the discovery occurred earlier on Tuesday morning. Staff were told not to say anything until the hospital was alerted.

By the time local police were called to the scene, hospital workers had already removed the body and linens from the laundry before officers arrived.

The hospital statement said that the immediate collection and securing of the remains was conducted 'according to proper procedures.'

It is not unusual for remains to stay in the morgue for an extended 
period of time depending on how the family wishes for the remains to 
treated.

The baby's body was found in hospital sheets delivered to the Crothall Laundry in Red Wing, Minnesota

Red Wing Police Chief Roger Pohlman said officers were shown a photo of the body and have interviewed witnesses at the laundry.

There is no indication of foul play in connection with the incident.

‘What
we have is that when they were preparing the laundry, a baby had fallen
out of a sheet, and that they had called the hospital where the laundry
had come from, and that they immediately sent people down to pick it 
up,’ said Pohlman.

‘It was after this had taken place that we received a call.’

Pohlman said his detectives have 
contacted St. Paul police to open a joint investigation. The Ramsey 
County medical examiner’s office will also be examining the remains.
