Granada coach Joaquin Caparros tore up Friday’s Marca front page in front of a packed press conference after it quoted him saying of Real Madrid visit on Saturday: 'All I ask for is that they don’t walk all over us.'

A furious Caparros began the press conference by holding the front page up before reporters and tearing to pieces.

He said: 'How can I face my players if they think I said this? All that’s missing is me asking God that they have mercy on us. People that know me know that I don’t give anyone anything.

'Do you think I would have said this? What a way to motivate my players and my supporters.'

Caparros had given Marca an interview ahead of Saturday's 3pm kick off in which he had said Real Madrid were the best side in Europe but the phrase 'Solo pido que no nos pasen por encima' translated literally as 'I only ask they don't pass over us' appeared as a quote in huge letters on Spain’s leading sports daily.

Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti, meanwhile, is aiming for his 11th straight victory in what is Real’s last game before the entertain Liverpool next week.

He could bring Gareth Bale back into the first team after the former Tottenham player returned from having missed the last two matches with a Gluteus problem.

Ancelotti whose only doubts ahead of the game are over Luka Modric and Pepe was asked if players would react badly to Bale’s return having won the Clasico and at Anfield so convincingly without him.

He said: 'I don’t think anyone could really be upset if he was picked. He was one of the best players for us last season and is one of the best players in the world.'
