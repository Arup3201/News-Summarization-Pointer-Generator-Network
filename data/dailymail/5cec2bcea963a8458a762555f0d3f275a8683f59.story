A florist claims that she has the most flooded home in Britain - caused by blocked drains which have swamped her garden for the last 40 years.

Elaine Hughes says her home, at the bottom of a hill in Chadwell Heath, north London, is flooded with filthy water every time it rains heavily.

For the last four decades, the 62-year-old has been unable to grow anything in her garden - which is left under water every few months.

Mrs Hughes (pictured) claims she has been unable to grow anything in her garden - which is regularly left under water

She believes run-off from blocked sewers at the top of the street ends up in her garden.

The grandmother, who has lived in the house since 1975, has been unable to have a lawn and grows all her plants in tall pots.

She said: 'It's all Thames Water's fault. The drain gets blocked and clogged up with grease and whatnot, and when it rains it floods my garden.

'They send a clean-up crew but they just spray disinfectant and leave. On hot days, my garden stinks.

'I've lost count of the number of times I've woken up to see my back garden covered in filth.

'It gets up to four or five inches above the paving stones - which are a good few inches above ground level anyway.'

Mrs Hughes does not feel safe letting her four-year-old granddaughter Lilly Deburgh-Car play outside, thanks to the filthy conditions.

She says she does not want to move because she likes her house and has always hoped that the problem would be sorted out.

'The bane of my life is Thames Water's attitude,' she said.

'They seem more content to spend more money cleaning up a mess than preventing one in the first place.

'And when they do come here, they don't do much apart from throw some disinfectant down and leave.'

Thames Water has confirmed there are a number of other properties on the street affected by sewer flooding.

A spokesperson said: 'The incident is caused by a build-up of cooking fat and grease blocking the sewer - as has been the case on previous occasions in this street.

'The blockage was cleared and the sewer immediately started flowing freely once again.'

There are currently no plans for a major overhaul of the sewage system in the area.
