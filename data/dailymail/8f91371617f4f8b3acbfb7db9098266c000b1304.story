Mould and buildings are usually an undesirable combination.

But one architect is set to transform a New York landmark by building a giant tower made of fungus.

It will be built from blocks composed of corn and fungus which will grow and mesh together.

Called Hy-Fi, the building (illustrated) will be built predominantly fugus bricks - as well as some light-reflecting ones -  and is set to open in June. It was designed by New York architect David Benjamin

The bricks will be composed of corn husks and mycelium - the vegetative part of fungus.

They will be grown in block-shaped moulds where roots will knit together to keep their shape.

Once used in the eco-friendly building, the 'self-assembling' fungus bricks will carry on growing and bond together to strengthen the overall structure.

The building will incorporate reflective bricks to throw light downwards onto the organic blocks so that they can carry on growing.

The Museum of Modern Art PS1 will host the eco-friendly organic structure, which has been designed to generate no waste and provide shade and seating for visitors to the gallery’s summer music concerts.

Called Hy-Fi, the building was designed by architect David Benjamin and will open this June.

The self-assembling' bricks will be made of a combination of corn husks and mycelium, which is the vegetative part of fungus.

The tower will be grown and return to the earth with hardly any environmental impact.

The shape of structure will be three open towers joined together and will include a bricks that will be coated with reflective film to bounce sunlight onto fungal root bricks below, to encourage them to grow

The two organic materials will be placed in block-shaped moulds where they will grow and once assembled, will continue to grow and mesh together, to strengthen the tower.

The shape of structure will be three open towers joined together and will include a bricks that will be coated with reflective film to bounce sunlight onto the fungal root bricks below, to encourage them to grow, The Verge reported.      

The structure’s strange shape is designed to push hot air upwards and draw colder air down to where people can sit and cool down, according to FastCo Design.

Pedro Gadanho, a curator in MoMA’s Department of Architecture and Design, said: ‘This material could really change the way people build.

‘It reinvents the most basic component of architecture - the brick - as both a material of the future and a classic trigger for open-ended design possibilities.’

Mr Benjamin, whose architecture firm, The Living, is based in New York, won the chance to build his organic structure at the gallery in the 15th Young Architects Programme competition, which demanded that designers create structures that do not create waste once their period of display is over.

His Hy-Fi design is almost carbon neutral in its construction and the reflective bricks will be returned to the company that makes the coating, while the other completely organic bricks will be composted.

Mr Benjamin told The New York Times: ‘We love the idea of testing new ideas by putting them out into the world so this is a huge opportunity for us.'
