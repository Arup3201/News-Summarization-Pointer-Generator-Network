Missing: Terry Dewayne Smith Jr went missing Saturday night while his step-brother was babysitting

Authorities searched for possible human remains on Wednesday at the home of an 11-year-old autistic boy who disappeared over the weekend -  but volunteers pledged to continue hunting for him in the scorching desert.

The home in Menifee, southern California was being treated as a crime scene and investigators were trying to determine whether remains were on the property, Mayor Scott Mann said in an email today.

Riverside County sheriff's detectives were led to the home shortly after 1am on Wednesday based on evidence indicating there might be a body there, Deputy Albert Martinez told the Riverside Press-Enterprise.

Details were not released but the Sheriff's Department suspended its search for Terry Dewayne Smith Jr.

'Our searchers are on standby. We are waiting to see what investigators find on the property,' Martinez  said.

Volunteers planned to continue searching the surrounding semi-rural area for the boy who was last seen on Saturday night.

'Until we have absolute confirmation from the sheriff directly, we will continue to do our job, which is to search,' said a posting on a Facebook page where the volunteer search was organized.

About 1,000 people, including sheriff's deputies on horseback, emergency workers and volunteers, hunted for him on Tuesday.

Authorities were concerned that he wandered away without food, water or his medication in an area 70 miles southeast of Los Angeles where temperatures have topped 100F.

In danger: Terry, who weighs 76 pounds and is 4'8", most likely did not take his medicine with him which will cause problems because he is a high-functioning autistic

The 4-foot-8 boy with sandy brown hair and brown eyes was last seen wearing blue basketball shorts. Local children were asked to not wear blue, to help avoid confusion.

Terry was last seen when he followed his 16-year-old step-brother, who told the boy to go home, the Desert Sun reported.

The boy's mother said she didn't realize he was missing until 10.30am the next day as she was out for the evening.

Terry's mother shared details of the boy's habits on the searchers' Facebook page. Without his medication, Terry may be 'over sensitive and may be walking on his tiptoes', the page said.

Searchers were also instructed to call him by his nickname 'Juju' because hearing his full name called out might cause him to believe he's in trouble and flee.

Neither Terry's mother nor his 
16-year-old step brother have spoke out publicly, nor have the police 
said why the teenager did not notice that his brother was missing 
sooner.

Investigators took 
quick action sending out the first search party on Sunday morning 
shortly after the boy's mother called to report him missing.

Sticking together: Hundreds of locals volunteered in Meniffe, California to try to raise awareness

High and low: Police searched on horseback and used bloodhounds to see if he was hiding in the nearby hills

The boy's father lives outside of California and has been ruled out as a suspect.

Police sent out hundreds of searching volunteers as well as police mounted on horseback and in helicopters.

'We too have a special needs child and we know how sometimes that they wander off and our hearts are breaking,' said volunteer Danielle Adamson.

Family friend Sophia Masih warned that if anyone spots Terry, who goes by the nickname Juju, they should approach him cautiously and try to initiate a conversation so that he begins to trust them.

'He acts and looks like he's seven,' she told The Press-Enterprise.

'Because he hasn't taken any of his medication his personality could be very angry, (so) no sudden movements or anything like that.'

Threat: The area has hit 100 degrees in recent days causing fears that he will be dehydrated
