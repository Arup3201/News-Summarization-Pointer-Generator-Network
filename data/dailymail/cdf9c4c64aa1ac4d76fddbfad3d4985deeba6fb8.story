Hayden Macey, 68, says Miss Westcott decided to ride 'unnecessarily slowly' along the narrow single track during his trial at Exeter Magistrates Court

A hunt protester drove his Land Rover into the back of a £90,000 racehorse during a moorland hunt, a court heard yesterday.

The horse’s female rider fell to the ground and had her throat grabbed by the driver, magistrates were told.

Hayden Macey, 68, is accused of assaulting huntswoman Michelle Westcott during a meeting of the Mid Devon hunt on Dartmoor.

Miss Westcott was riding a horse called According to Lawrence along a steep and narrow lane when the Land Rover started to approach from behind.

Prosecutor Sonia Croft said the vehicle was being driven by Mr Macey who was monitoring events as an ‘anti-hunt protester’.

She claimed Mr Macey blew his horn before striking the horse in the back of its legs, forcing the animal to move sharply forwards and then jolt sideways.

She said: ‘The Land Rover took the opportunity of squeezing past and pinning the horse against a stone wall.’

After the horse reared up and threw Miss Westcott to the ground, he allegedly stopped the vehicle, walked up to the rider and grabbed her by the throat.

Giving evidence Miss Westcott said the racehorse was not hers but she was used to riding it.

She confirmed that after the incident her leg and arm were injured and she could not put any weight on her leg for two weeks. The  horse’s back was strained.

And under cross examination she admitted that she had been walking along the lane rather than ‘trotting or cantering’.

However she denied obstructing the track with the horse, which she said was a calm rather than a ‘twitchy’ animal.

Another meeting at the Mid Devon Hunt. Mr Macey said he has been monitoring hunts for the last 30 years up to three times a week. His Land Rover was carrying a number of hunt monitors during the alleged attack

Meanwhile Mr Macey accused Miss Westcott of deciding to ride ‘unnecessarily slowly’ along the narrow single track.

He told Exeter Magistrates’ Court she was ‘quite deliberately holding us up and delaying us’ as they monitored the hunt.

Mr Macey, from Newton Abbot, Devon, said he has been monitoring hunts for the last 30 years up to three times a week.

His Land Rover was carrying a number of hunt monitors at the time of the incident.

He told magistrates that the  vehicle was stationary when Miss Westcott struck the roof of the car with her whip.

And his colleagues said the noise of the whip hitting the roof caused the thoroughbred racehorse to go backwards before rearing up and throwing her to the ground. Mr Macey also denied pinning her and the horse against a stone wall and said he had not been ‘frustrated and aggressive’ when obstructed by the rider.

He claimed there was no physical contact at all between him and the rider, and even accused Miss Westcott of verbally abusing him.

Mr Macey added: ‘The whole thing is utterly absurd, ridiculous and preposterous.

‘In 30 years I have received black eyes and broken ribs all because I campaign for animals.’

Fellow hunt monitor Sarah Wheeler saw the incident from the back of the vehicle.

She told the court that Miss Westcott swore at Mr Macey and raised her riding crop and that the defendant only raised his hands to protect his head.

But Miss Westcott stuck to her story when questioned, insisting that she had been trying to pull into a passing place when the driver beeped his car’s horn five times and then struck the horse on the back of its legs.

The court also heard that both Mr Macey and Miss Westcott gave differing accounts to police about the incident.

Mr Macey denies assaulting Miss Westcott and failing to report an accident.

The case continues.
