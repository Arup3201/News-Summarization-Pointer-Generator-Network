Hundreds of protesters caused chaos for Christmas shoppers at a London shopping centre last night with a mass demonstration over the death of American man Eric Garner, who died while being arrested in New York.

Up to 600 protesters gathered in the 1,883,700 sq ft mall in Shepherd’s Bush, west London, before lying down on the floor as part of the ‘die-in’ demonstration and chanting: ‘I can’t breathe’. 

Police arrested 76 people at the protest, which was over the death of Mr Garner – a 43-year-old black man who choked to death in New York City in July as he was arrested for selling loose, untaxed cigarettes.

Several shoppers said shops were forced to put their shutters down amid fears of damage by the protesters, while others claimed to be held outside of the mall by police who desperately tried to get the demonstration under control. 

Others expressed concerns about the 'intimidating' behaviour of some of the demonstrators, as well as the timing of the mass protest at the packed mall, which came just over three weeks before Christmas.

Anger: Protesters held a mass 'die-in' at the Westfield shopping centre in Shepherd's Bush, London. They aimed to raise awareness of the death of Eric Garner, a black man who died as he was arrested in New York

The participants chanted: 'I can't breathe' - Eric Garner's final words - in solidarity with U.S. protesters

London protest organisers wrote on Facebook that the event was being held to denounce 'the lack of consequences for Eric Garner's murderer, as well as against the institutionalised racism of police'

Shoppers described some of the masked protesters as 'intimidating bullies' after the protest last night

Shoppers took to Twitter to condemn the behaviour of some of the demonstrators at last night's protest

Stephanie Haigh ‏wrote on Twitter: 'I'm all for protests IF the reason is genuine but the scary masked idiots in Westfield tonight we're just intimidating bullies.'

Meanwhile, shopper Tom Bassindale said: 'Pretty awful behaviour by "protesters" at Westfield intimidating shoppers & staff. Police calm and efficient.'

Laura Kate ‏said: 'The protesters are inside Westfield now. Being neither calm nor particularly peaceful, from my observation. Blergh.'

And another, who took to Twitter, under the name @afterfuse, said: 'Just found out why I couldn't get into #Westfield AND got home 35mins late because of #Ferguson protest. Morons.' 

Shopper Alice Rose described Westfield as 'like a war zone', while another said: 'Well I went to Westfield the wrong day to do xmas shopping.' 

Another shopper, called Sophie, said on Twitter: 'Wow, the shops are starting to close their shutters #Westfield #icantbreathe #london2nyc #handsupdontshoot'.

The protest got underway at about 6pm  after an air horn signalled the start of the demonstration and all those involved began to lie down on the floor and start chanting: 'I can't breathe'.

Many shoppers could be seen stopping to watch the protest, which filled large sections of the mall. Others were reportedly held outside the shopping centre as police contained the demonstrators.

Thousands have protested in New York and elsewhere since the announcement last week that a grand jury would not indict a white police officer over Mr Garner's death.

Mr Garner repeatedly gasped 'I can't breathe' in an arrest that was captured on video prior to his death.

Police arrested a total of 76 in the vicinity of the Westfield mall in connection with the demonstration last night. All of those arrested were taken to various police stations across west and north London for questioning. 

Protesters, who police said broke away from the main group and attempted to get inside the centre, were arrested on suspicion of public order offences, with one man further arrested on suspicion of assault. 

Police were called to the mall to help control the protest, which ended up spilling outside of the centre

Police said a 'number of tactics - including a containment for the purpose of preventing violence and effecting arrests' were used to help control the demonstration in support of those protesting against Mr Garner's death

Officers patrolled the west London area surrounding the mall heavily last night following the mass protest

In a statement, Scotland Yard said the breakaway group assaulted security staff and caused damage to property during the demonstration.

London protest organisers, London Black Revs, wrote on Facebook that the event was being held to denounce 'the lack of consequences for Eric Garner's murderer, as well as against the institutionalised racism of police in both the U.S. and the UK, and the continued murders of black people that go unpunished'.

Metropolitan Police said they dealt with the protesters in London using tactics 'including a containment for the purpose of preventing violence and effecting arrests'.

A statement from the Met added: '76 people were subsequently arrested on suspicion of public order offences; one man was further arrested on suspicion of assault.

'They have been taken to various London police stations for questioning.'

Chief Superintendent Mark Bird, who was in charge of the policing operation, said: 'We will always work with those that wish to demonstrate lawfully - as the majority of protestors did yesterday.

'However, we will not tolerate the small minority that offer violence or commit other criminal acts, such as that witnessed outside Westfield yesterday evening.'

'So much respect to the people having manicures in Westfield who stood up and joined in chanting 'I can't breathe',' one user wrote on the social media site.

A spokesman for the shopping centre confirmed shops remained open throughout the demonstration.

The spokesman added: 'Westfield London worked closely with the MET to manage the protest for Eric Garner which took place on Wednesday evening. 

'To ensure the safety of shoppers, retailers and protesters, a designated area was provided outside Shepherd's Bush station however a group of protesters also gathered in the centre. 

'The first protest passed peacefully and protesters exited the centre.

'A small group of protesters later attempted to force entry to the centre past Westfield security. Members of this group were detained by MET police officers. 

'This is now a police matter. Throughout the protest the centre remained open and trading.' 

Police lined up outside the White City shopping mall, as the protest spilled out onto the surrounding streets

Many held placards saying 'solidarity with Ferguson' while others held signs which read 'I can't breathe'

Westfield said shops at the huge mall were able to stay open and continue trading despite the mass protest

The protests come after a grand jury's decision not to indict police over the death of Eric Garner in the U.S.
