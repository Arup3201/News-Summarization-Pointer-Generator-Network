The bloody sock worn by ex-Boston Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling during the 2004 World Series could fetch up to $600,000 at auction.

The sock will go up for live auction on Friday in New York by Texas-based Heritage Auctions.

A spokesman for the auction house predicts the bloody garment will fetch some significant cash.

Blood money: Curt Schilling's bloody sock, shown here during the 2004 World Series, is expected to fetch as much as $600,000

'This is obviously the first time we've ever offered a sock at auction,' Chris Ivy, Director of Sports Auctions for Heritage, told CNBC.

'But it relates to a very significant moment in the World Series.'

Schilling was wearing the sock when he pitched the baseball championship game on October 24, 2004 with a damaged tendon, which led to the bleeding.

Though he could barely walk, he pitched six innings, only allowing a single run.

That Game 2 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals paved the way for the Red Sox to secure their first championship in 86 years, ending the 'Curse of the Bambino' that has hung over the Boston team since 1918, when the Red Sox sold star slugger Babe Ruth to the Yankees.

The sock previously had been on loan to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.

It has been at Heritage's Dallas headquarters for several weeks and on display at the auction house's Manhattan office before it is sold.

Schilling is putting the sock up for auction given the retired MLB star has not found success in his post-baseball career.

Schilling's company, 38 Studios, was 
lured to Providence, Rhode Island, from Massachusetts with a $75million 
loan guarantee in 2010.

In May, it laid off all its employees and it filed for bankruptcy in June. 

The state is now likely responsible for some $100million related to the deal, including interest.

Schilling also had personally guaranteed loans to the company and listed the sock as bank collateral in a September filing with the Massachusetts secretary of state's office.

He has said he invested as much as $50million in 38 Studios and has lost all his baseball earnings.

He told WEEI-AM in Boston last year that possibly having to sell the sock was part of 'having to pay for your mistakes.'

'I'm obligated to try and make amends and, unfortunately, this is one of the byproducts of that,' he told the station.

The bloody sock is one of two that sent Schilling into the annals of baseball lore in 2004.

The
other was from Game 6 of the American League Championship Series, when 
Schilling pitched against the New York Yankees with an injured ankle.

That sock is said to have been discarded in the trash at Yankees Stadium.

The hall had had the sock since 2004.

Heritage
last May auctioned off the so-called 'Bill Buckner ball,' which rolled 
through the legs of the Red Sox first baseman in the 1986 World Series.

Ivy
said that item, like Schilling's sock, was listed at the time as being 
expected to bring in '$100,000-plus,' but it was sold to an anonymous 
bidder for $418,000.

'We wouldn't be surprised to see this do something in that range,' he said, estimating the sock could be sold for as much as $600,000.

Payment: Last year, Schilling told a radio station that he would possibly sell the sock as a part of 'having to pay for your mistakes'
