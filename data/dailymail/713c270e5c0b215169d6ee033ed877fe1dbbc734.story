A South Texas transgender student has been cut from his high school yearbook because the photo he submitted 'goes against community standards'.

Jeydon Loredo, 18, a senior who was born biologically female but has identified as male from a young age, submitted a yearbook portrait of himself wearing a tuxedo to La Feria Independent High School, near McAllen.

The boys at the school usually wear suits in their photos.

However Jeydon's mother, Stella Loredo, received a letter saying her son's picture had been rejected from the yearbook and that to be included he would need to wear a 'drape or blouse'.

Denied: Jeydon Loredo, 18, submitted this photo of himself for his high school yearbook. It was rejected

The South Poverty Law Center and Human Rights Campaign saying it is a civil rights violation and discrimination case, according to KGBT-TV.

The Loredo's lawyer, Alesdair Ittelson, said they will fight the school until the end.

'We are going to do whatever is necessary to make sure Jeydon's picture is in the yearbook and that he's in the yearbook in a tuxedo, like the other boys in his school,' Mr Ittelson said.

'We hope that we don't have to bring a federal lawsuit, but if it becomes necessary we absolutely will take it there.'

Stella Loredo said she was infuriated by the situation.

'We all support him, and for the school district to make this decision and say he is not male and not allowing this photo to be in there is infuriating,' she said.

Jeydon said he hopes to be part of the yearbook like every other kid in his school.

'When I found it was really upsetting to me,' he said.

Stella Loredo provided this letter showing why her son's picture was denied, citing it goes against 'community standards'

'I just want to be in the yearbook to be remembered years down the road, because people forget.'That's really all I want.'

La Feria Independent High School superintendent Ray Villarreal said a decision on the photo had not been made as they were ‘trying to work through it in the best interest of the student, the school and the community’.

Jeydon's lawyer, Alesdair Ittelson, accused Mr Villarreal of purposely not allowing the photo to be printed and said this contravened federal law.

He added he planned to speak to the institution’s lawyer so he could resolve the matter in a timely manner.
