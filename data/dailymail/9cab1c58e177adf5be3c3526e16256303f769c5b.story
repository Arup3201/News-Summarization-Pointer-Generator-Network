A neighbourly row over a 3ft garden fence has spilled over into the courts because a woman painted her side of a fence white.

Lyndsey Gagrica, 34, has been charged with criminal damage after her neighbours of 13 years reported her to police over the dispute.

Sue and David Ward, both 59, paid £80 for a fence to sit on top of a low wall in the front garden of their semi-detached home in Carlton, Nottingham, and spent a further £172 on council planning application fees.

Lyndsey Gagrica has been charged with criminal damage after painting her neighbour's fence white on the side facing her home in Carlton, Nottingham

The 3ft fence was erected on top of the low wall dividing the front gardens of the semi-detached houses

But the couple, who have lived in their home for 25 years, were incensed when Mrs Gagrica, a beautician, painted the side facing her house bright white in February.

The latest in a string of arguments between the neighbours was 'the straw that broke the camel's back', according to Mrs Ward, and they called the police.

Mrs Gagrica, who lives with her husband and daughter, was ordered to attend Carlton police station last month and has since been charged.

She will appear in front of Nottingham magistrates this month.

Mrs Gagrica said: 'They wouldn’t be able to see anything on my side. I don’t understand how it could be criminal damage.

'I was made to feel like a criminal for doing nothing more than picking up a tin and a brush.

'I even got some advice from Homebase as to what the best type of paint would be.

'I think it’s diabolical that they think I shouldn’t have any say in what my side of the fence looks like.'

Mrs Ward said the fence was put up to maintain the couple's privacy.

She said: 'I didn’t feel like I could go in the garden.

The Wards, who have lived in their home for 25 years, put the fence up for privacy

'Some of the white paint is dripping through on to my side, and I only have planning permission to have it brown.

'Every time I make any changes to my house, she will do something without asking us.

'This was the straw that broke the camel’s back. I just wanted someone with authority to tell her to leave us alone.'

The Wards said Mrs Gagrica had no right to alter the £80 fence, which also cost them £172 in planning permission fees

The Wards and the Gagricas have lived side by side in the Nottingham suburb for 13 years
