Deployed: Prince Harry after arriving in Afghanistan last week

The Taliban today said they were doing everything in their power to kidnap or assassinate Prince Harry during his tour of Afghanistan.

Just four days after the 27-year-old arrived in the volatile Helmand province, militants confirmed that he was one of their prime targets.

'We are using all our strength to get rid of him, either by killing or kidnapping,' Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told Reuters by telephone from an undisclosed location.

'We have informed our commanders in Helmand to do whatever they can to eliminate him,' Mujahid added, declining to go into detail on what he dubbed the 'Harry operations'.

The 27-year-old prince, who is third 
in line to the throne, took up his new role two weeks after he was 
photographed frolicking naked in Las Vegas.

Known in the military as Captain Harry Wales, he first served in Afghanistan in 2008 as an on-ground air controller.

But his tour was cut short when a news blackout, designed to protect him while on the front line, collapsed.

The Ministry of Defence has said the threat to Prince Harry's life in Afghanistan was less severe in helicopters.

He
arrived under cover of darkness last week to join the Apache unit which
has the highest 'kill rate' in the war. He will be based at Camp 
Bastion for four months.

Captain
Wales will be a co-pilot gunner 
during his four-month deployment, meaning he will fire the aircraft’s 
weapons.

Harry’s
arrival at Camp Bastion, where he will serve with 662 Squadron, 3 
Regiment Army Air Corps comes four weeks after a storm over his antics 
in Las Vegas.

Pictures emerged of the prince naked 
during an alcohol-fuelled game of strip billiards in his £5,100-a-night 
suite at the luxurious Encore Wynn Hotel.

Although
he was said to be letting off steam ahead of his deployment to 
Afghanistan, the third-in-line to the throne received a stern 
dressing-down by senior officers for his role in the frolics.

Senior figures within the Taliban have claimed they are prepared to negotiate a ceasefire with the West and abandon its links with al-Qaeda, it has emerged.

In a paper released by a British think-tank, four unnamed senior Taliban figures from the past and present say an emerging consensus is 'far more pragmatic' than has been made public before.

The paper, released by the Royal United Services Institute, suggests the Taliban council would consider a ceasefire following negotiations.

According to The Times, this would be in exchange for a role in Afghanistan's political future.

Harry – who has been dubbed ‘the 
party prince’ – was keen to return to Afghanistan after his first tour 
of duty was cut short  in 2008.

The prince had been secretly deployed
with the Household Cavalry as a forward air controller directing 
bombing strikes against insurgents for ten weeks.

His time there was cut short when news of his presence was leaked on foreign websites and he was brought back to Britain.

However,
Harry was so determined to do another tour of duty that he retrained as
an Apache pilot in the hope it would increase his chances of being 
redeployed.

The Queen and 
Prince of Wales were fully briefed about his return to the war zone.

Prince Charles was ‘immensely proud’ of his son, said St James’s Palace.

The Ministry of 
Defence confirmed the deployment after a threat assessment concluded 
that his presence in Helmand would not  put him or his comrades at 
greater risk.
