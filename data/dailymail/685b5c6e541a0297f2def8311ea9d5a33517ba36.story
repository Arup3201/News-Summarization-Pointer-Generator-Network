A South Carolina family are on track to break the GoFundMe.com record after raising more than $801,000 to help find a cure for their 4-year-old daughter's rare, terminal disorder.

In just a few short months, Glenn and Cara O'Neill's campaign has received enough donations to fully fund the medicine required for a clinical trial for their daughter Eliza's Sanfilippo syndrome that should hopefully take place later this year.

The deadly genetic disorder means Eliza lacks an enzyme to break down heparin sulfate, which naturally occurs in cells, causing it to build up over time and resulting in a variety of medical problems.Â

Big help: In just a few short months, the GoFundMe campaign has raised more than $801,000 for Eliza's care

While it's barely detectable in the little girl now, she will lose the ability to speak by her 5th birthday, and the O'Neills say she'll die before she reaches her 20s.

Faced with this prospect, the caring parents took to social media to help their daughter, given funding for rare diseases is hard to come by.

According to ABC News, researchers Doug McCarty and Haiyan Fu of Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, have been working on a cure for the disorder that affects one in 70,000 babies.

After about 16 years, they've found a gene therapy treatment that works in mice and are ready to test it in humans but they need $2 million in all to make the clinical trial happen.

So close: The family are merely thousands away from breaking the GoFundMe record, which is currently at $808,845 for Boston Marathon bombing victim Jeff Bauman

Desperate to make the most of this opportunity, Glenn O'Neill said he enlisted the help of filmmaker Benjamin Von Wong after he Googled 'how to make a viral video' and the pair shot a moving story about Eliza and her condition to launch their GoFundMe fundraiser.

Now, thanks to thousands of generous strangers the world over, they have raised enough for the drugs necessary to test the treatment on Eliza and other Sanfilippo sufferers.

'The first major step towards saving our daughter is complete,' the O'Neills said in a statement yesterday.

'The medicine will be ready in December and Eliza and others like her will have the chance to get the treatment they so desperately need.'

Not there yet: The O'Neills have a busy summer and fall ahead as they attempt to attract enough donations to pay for the clinical trial to be carried out - another $1 million

And they are merely thousands away from breaking the GoFundMe record, which is currently at $808,845 for Boston Marathon bombing victim Jeff Bauman.

Two other Boston Marathon bombing victims, Celeste and Sydney Corcoran, are in second place with $794,335.

'The O'Neill family's efforts are a true testament of two parents' unwavering love for their daughter, and the willingness to do whatever it takes to reach their goal,' GoFundMe CEO Brad Damphousse told ABC News of the impressive feat.

However, the family are not there yet. The O'Neills have a busy summer and fall ahead as they attempt to attract enough donations to pay for the trial to be carried out - another $1 million.

Overall, Eliza is doing well, her father told ABC News. Though they are desperate to hit their target.

'We do notice things related to the syndrome in the way that she processes information,' O'Neill said. 'She is not regressing on anything though and still learning - just at a slow pace and behind her peers.'
