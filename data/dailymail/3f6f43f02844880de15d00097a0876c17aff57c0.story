Taxpayer-paid executives running the Sellafield nuclear power plant billed £714 to chauffeur-drive a cat, expense claims revealed today.

Bosses at consortium Nuclear Management Partners (NMP) also used the perk to pay for flights to the US Masters golf tournament and Amazon purchases submitted without receipts.

NMP were brought in to decommission a nuclear plant at Sellafield in Cumbria, but senior staff have now been forced to hand back thousands of pounds after an audit of their claims between 2008 and 2012.

From more than 606 expense documents it emerged £236,781 of claims were requested without a proper description, £30,557 worth were purely for personal expenditure and £42,711 should not have been claimed at all.

Shocking: Executives brought in to decommission part of the Sellafield Nuclear plant in Cumbria put in a series of problematic expense claims, including £714 to taxi a cat

One executive claimed £714 for a 'repatriation' by taxi for themselves 'and the cat', another claimed £719 for Amazon buys without receipts and an £82-per-head gourmet dinner in France.

Other claims included a £2,795 on flights to the US Masters golf 
tournament in Augusta, Georgia, and a £2,316 Apple desktop computer.

Jamie Reed, Labour MP for Copeland in Cumbria, which contains Sellafield told City AM: 'A workforce that is being asked to accept many changes – including pay restraint – will have many questions.

'Taxis for cats and flights to the US Masters simply beggars belief.'

NNP said in a statement its management id not 'understand' a 'complicated and bureaucratic' expenses systems.

It came the day after it was revealed the same senior managers have pocketed more than £6million in bonuses over the last three years, despite a series of failings.

Executives seconded to Sellafield Ltd to have received bonuses ranging from £2 million to £2.5 million since 2009.

The taxpayer-funded bonuses for senior staff at the Sellafield site were paid for using funds from the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), the public non-departmental body which agreed the terms of the contract under which Sellafield Ltd operates.

Energy Minister Michael Fallon revealed that a total of £6.6 million was paid out in bonuses.

In the financial year 2009/10, NMP executives received £1,999,192; in 2010/11 the figure was £2,451,269 and in 2011/12 the executive bonus pot totalled £2,148,035.

The bonuses are likely to be the subject of much scrutiny after a series of setbacks at the site, which according to the firm's deputy managing director George Beveridge houses the most hazardous industrial building in western Europe.

A contract was awarded to NMP to run the Cumbrian site for up to a maximum of 17 years starting in 2009 - including a break clause after the first five years - in the belief that the private sector would be able to manage the site more efficiently.

But a report by the National Audit Office found that costs had spiralled from £47 billion, when it first started work on the site in 2009, to £67 billion by 2012 after key deadlines were missed.

In June, the company was fined £700,000 and ordered to pay more than £72,000 costs for sending bags of radioactive waste to a landfill site in Cumbria.

The bonuses were disclosed in answer to a parliamentary question from Margaret Ritchie, former leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP).

The South Down MP, who is also the SDLP's shadow spokewoman on energy, said: 'The Government and the NDA have serious questions to answer about this.

'It is unacceptable for this amount of public money to be paid in bonuses to a private consortium whose management of the decommissioning process at Sellafield has been so appalling.

'This is a consortium who in 2010/11 failed to meet targets in 12 of 14 major projects, yet in the same year senior executives received over £2 million in bonuses.'

The NDA is currently reviewing the performance of NMP and a decision on whether or not to extend the contract into its second term or make use of the break clause will be decided in due course.

A spokeswoman for NMP said: 'Whilst we do not disclose information on the private financial arrangements between Nuclear Management Partners (NMP) and its personnel, the bonus levels of Executive Directors seconded to Sellafield Ltd reflect the fee that NMP earns, based upon meeting performance targets agreed annually with the NDA.

'There is therefore a clear link between the payment of bonuses and performance. 2012/13 bonus levels - not included in the data quoted - were lower to reflect this year's performance in that financial year.

'The bonuses of NMP seconded Sellafield Ltd Executive Directors are included in the overall executive remuneration costs which are published each year in the Sellafield Ltd Annual Report and Accounts.'
