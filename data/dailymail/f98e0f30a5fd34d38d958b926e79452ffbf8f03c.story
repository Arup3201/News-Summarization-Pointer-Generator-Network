The nine skydivers who stared death in the face after two planes they were on collided 12,000 feet in the air said today it hasn't put them off the extreme sport because it is a 'part of who they are'.

What was supposed to be a moment of perfectly-timed air acrobatics and exhilarating free-falls turned into a terrifying jump-for-your-life situation when one Cessna suddenly sandwiched on top of the other - and it was all captured on camera.

The experienced skydivers, from Wisconsin, appeared on the Today show as the incredible footage from their helmet cams was played.

Wisconsin skydivers: When asked by Matt Lauer if they would get back into a plane again after their miraculous escape, all nine put up their hands with one women admitting she is more afraid of spiders

Amy Olson, left, remembers the pilot screaming at them to 'Go!', ordering them to jump. 'That's probably the worst, was hearing him scream,' she said through tears. 'It's pretty raw.'

Brave: This skydiver describes how me made his way over to the plane that was on fire (while free falling) to see if the pilot was OK

Calm under pressure: Blake the pilot describes flying his plane after the collision and landing it safely which, they joked, was one of his better landings

In one shot, tiny black figures can be made out free-falling through the sky as one of the planes fireballs in the distance, with large chunks of it breaking off.

When asked by Matt Lauer if they would get back into a plane again after their miraculous escape, all nine put up their hands with one women admitting she is more afraid of spiders that jumping.

'It's what we do. It's just part of who we are,' they explained.

Barry Sinnex revealed he tried to chase the plane that was on fire as he was free-falling to see if the pilot was OK and when he saw him jump from the plane, he chased him to make sure he could open his chute.

'Everybody else had parachutes on, so they were kind of on their own, so I chased the plane. I think Dan did too, he came down with me,' he said.

'We chased the airplane to see if the pilot got out. Once I saw the pilot bail out, I made sure he was going to open the parachute because he was a student.'

Patricia Roy said: 'I thought it was a joke at first. Obviously not a very funny or appropriate one. But it was all so surreal.

'I thought oh my God they're getting closer. I expected the other plane to move away.'

Incredible: Five of the skydivers involved in the Wisconsin plane crash on Saturday fall from the sky after the aircraft accidentally collided, causing one to erupt in flames

Impact: The skydivers were perched on the edge of the plane ready to jump as the other one hit, causing a massive fire bomb

Exact: This is the moment the two planes hit, sending two divers who were preparing to jump flying out of the aircraft

Daniel Chandler, who became wedged in between the two planes and almost collided with the propeller said: 'It was unpleasant. I had no time to react....The sound 
behind me, I'll never forget.

'And that's all I could do was try and stay
 forward and try not to move because I knew I was going to live where I 
was, or thought I could.'

Amy Olsen could not contain her 
emotions while recounting the collision. Through tears she said she 
remembers the pilot screaming at them 'Go!', ordering them to jump.

'That's probably the worst, was hearing him scream. It's pretty raw.'

Blake Weldan, who managed to fly one of the planes to safety and land perfectly at Richard I. Bong Airport in Douglas County, joked that it was one of his better landings and said he has no idea how the crash occurred.

'Everything was as it should have been,' he said.

'We were just kind of lucky that we were at the point where we were out of the airplane,' said 64-year-old flight instructor Mike Robinson, who was in the lead plane.

'If we'd been back in the rear of the airplane when they collided it might have been a little bit different.'

Both wings came off the lead plane in the collision and the pilot had to abandon the plane using a parachute on board.

He was the only one with reported injuries, suffering from cuts as he exited the burning plane.

Falling: One of the divers tumbles out of the plane just after impact

Once out of the plane, the skydivers had to carefully maneuver their chutes to stay out of the path of raining debris.

'We're
 in free fall, so we're falling about 120 miles miles an hour vertically
 down,' Mr Robinson said. 'But then we open our parachutes, and now all 
of a sudden they're falling faster than we are...Fortunately, everybody 
kept it together so they just avoided (the debris).'

All
 11 on board the two planes survived the collision. The only person 
injured was the pilot of the lead plane, who was taken to the hospital 
for minor injuries.

'He may need some stitches, but he's not seriously hurt,' Mr Robinson said.

Split apart: Both wings of the lead plane became detached and Robinson said he watched it crash to the ground in three pieces

Falling pieces: Several people in the Superior area reported seeing the plane falling to the ground but no one was injured by the debris

Miraculously, no one on the ground was injured by the falling wreckage - but plenty saw them crash to the ground.

Mike Plaunt lives in the area and often hears and sees the skydivers, but he noticed something was off about yesterday's jump.

'I
 went outside and looked and could see parachuters and a drop plane, and
 then there was something spiraling down. I couldn't identify what it 
was..it had a trail of smoke and I had never seen that before,' he said.

Happy to be alive: Two people hug after all 11 aboard the two planes landed safely

Quick thinking: The pilot of the tracking plane was able to land it safely, but the lead plane was not so lucky. It crashed to the ground in several piece. The pilot of that airplane escaped by parachute as well

While
 Mr Robinson still doesn't know why exactly the two planes collided, he 
believes the lead plane may have created unstable air for the tracking 
plane.

The Federal Aviation Administration will investigate the crash today.

It's
 still uncertain what will happen to the skydiving company, since they 
only owned the two planes. But it is the end of their season anyway.

Mr
 Robinson says the crash yesterday happened during the fourth jump of 
his day, and that he's done over 900 jumps in his lifetime.

'I'll remember this one more than most,' he said.
