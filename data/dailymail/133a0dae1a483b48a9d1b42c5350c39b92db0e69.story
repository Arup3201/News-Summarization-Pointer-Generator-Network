January was a quiet month for Brendan Rodgers in terms of transfers but there was one move Liverpool’s manager knew he had to make.

Having watched Jordon Ibe grow and develop in 24 demanding games on loan for Derby County, Rodgers felt compelled to bring him back to Merseyside and see if he could make a contribution in the frantic pursuit of a Champions League place.

It might have seemed an unusual decision, to give a 19-year-old with such little top flight experience such a big responsibility, but Rodgers’ thinking was clear. While staying in the East Midlands would have aided his education, why should another manager benefit when he could aid Liverpool?

And do not doubt that Rodgers rates him. He has regularly spoken of him in glowing terms, saying that if you turned up at Melwood and were unaware of who was who in his squad, you would have Ibe down as Portuguese or Spanish given his technical ability and skill.

‘We brought him back because with system we play (3-4-3), he can play in four positions,’ Rodgers explained ahead of this trip to Goodison Park. ‘There is greater chance for him to play. I felt for six months, he needed to go out and play consistently.

‘He went with Steve MacLaren at Derby, who is a very good coach and plays really good football. This was the ideal time to bring him back and he has matured really well. It is unfortunate he is not able to play in cup games but he has got incredible talent. My job is to nurture that.’

So back came Ibe and, true to his word, Rodgers has given him minutes, first at Aston Villa then against West Ham before, most significantly, unleashing him from the start in the frenzy of a Merseyside derby.

Rodgers isn’t afraid to make big calls nor does he ever consider age if he thinks a player is good enough, so with Lazar Markovic nursing a back problem, in came the England youth international, whose first Liverpool appearance in May 2013 came on the day Jamie Carragher retired.

If the game was a disappointment, one of the most ordinary, tame and mundane 90 minutes this grand old fixture has ever witnessed, Ibe most certainly wasn’t and he was responsible for providing the genuine moments of entertainment.

First there was electric charge down the right flank, then a chance arriving on to a Raheem Sterling cross before, most spectacularly of all, he cracked a drive against the side of a post from 25 yards after he had turned Bryan Oviedo one way then the other.

While others wanted too many touches and were deliberate with their passes, Ibe was constantly looking for a way to stamp his name on the game right until the very end. Fearless and exciting, this will not be the last we see of him. His future is certainly bright. 

Ibe could be part of a very bright future for Liverpool under Brendan Rodgers
