Angry residents have slammed Flagstaff city's use of clean drinking water to make snow for a two-day skiing event during the longest winter dry spell in the area's history.

For the second year in a row, officials have used 400,000 gallons of potable water to create snow for the Dew Downtown Flagstaff Urban Ski and Snowboard Festival in Arizona, happening this weekend.

While the city argues potable water is cleaner for snowboarders and skiers than reclaimed water, many residents say the practice is wasteful and bad for the environment.

Before

Dry: Flagstaff officials have been forced to make snow with clean water for an annual event because of low snowfall totals in the town

Arid: Officials say relatively low snow levels in Arizona left them with no choice but to manufacture snow so the profitable snow event could proceed

After

Outrage: Flagstaff residents are furious the city is using 440,000 gallons of potable water to create snow for the annual Dew Downtown Flagstaff Urban Ski and Snowboard Festival

Inefficient: Having failed to apply for a permit that would allow for the use of reclaimed water to make the snow, Flagstaff city officials used drinking water to create this snow ramp

By the numbers: Officials say the 400,000 gallons of potable water used to create this snow is a drop in the ocean compared with the 2.7 billion gallons delivered each year in Flagstaff

'Wasting 400,000 
gallons of water on a two-day event in the arid southwest is not a 
prudent use of our scarce resources,' environmental advocacy group, Friends of Flagstaff's Future, said.

'We
 hope to work with other community groups and our city to find 
opportunities that promote tourism and engage our community in fun 
activities but that are also aligned with principals of sustainability.'

Azdailyasun.com reported the U.S. Drought Monitor last month expanded drought conditions across northern Arizona, reclassifying the Flagstaff region as 'abnormally dry'.

In spite of this, the city of Flagstaff maintains the economic benefits of using potable water outweigh the environmental concerns.

The annual festival attracts hundreds of tourists each year keen to watch snowboarders and skiers compete.

According to Azfamily.com, the city reported a 19 percent increase in 
sales tax revenue during the past two events. Revenue from bed, board 
and beverage tax was also up by 13 percent.

Small business owners have backed the use of potable water, saying the tourist boom has helped improve their ailing operations.

'We
 just expanded our store now, so we have a lot more room for people to 
come through, and it helps with lunch and drink sales,' business owner Kevin Collins told azfamily.com.

'It brings people down here to the store and keeps us busy as well.'

Vino Loco owner Weston Miller said he sees a 30 percent boost in 
sales during the festival.

'It's kind of right out our back door, so it brings a lot of people in throughout the day drinking wine and beer,' he said.

City spokeswoman Kimberly Ott told azfamily.com 400,000 gallons is about
 an hour's worth of water supply for the entire community during the 
summer, and a drop in the ocean compared with the 2.7 billion gallons delivered each year in Flagstaff.

'It's a tough call and 
it's something that the city took really seriously when you have the 
water conservation concern, but you also have the economic benefit to 
the community,' Ott said.

Although Ott insisted the ongoing drought left the city with no option but to use fresh water 'to get the same (snow) base,' naztoday.com reported officials initially planned to use recycled water but didn't file their permit application on time.

Meanwhile, disgruntled residents firmly oppose the use of drinking water.

'We're
 in a huge drought,' Flagstaff local Geoffery
 Bishop said.

'There's absolutely no need for an 
event like this, in my opinion, at all during that time.

Alexa Vagnozzi agreed, saying the city has other options.

'I
 would prefer the more contaminated reclaimed water rather than the 
drinking water because we don't want to take away the drinking water 
from Flagstaff citizens or anything like that,' she said.

Profitable: The city reported a 19 percent increase in sales tax revenue during the past two events which they say offsets any environmental concerns of using drinking water to make snow for the event
