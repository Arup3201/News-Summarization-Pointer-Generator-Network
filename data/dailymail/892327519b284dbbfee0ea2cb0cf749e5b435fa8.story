David James continues to impress for new side Kerala Blasters as he kept a fourth consecutive clean sheet in a 1-0 win at Delhi Dynamos on Sunday.

The former England keeper was in inspired form as the visitors moved up to third in the Indian Super League, after Penn Orji's goal was enough to see off a Delhi side containing Juventus legend Alessandro Del Piero.

James humbly acknowledged praise aimed towards him in the post-match press conference, while insisting it is the collective team effort which is the recipe for their current success.

He told ISL.com: 'We all are playing unbelievingly well. Today, we made many clearances and tackles and that's what we need to do.

'If every individual in the team has the desire of not conceding, then, that desire translates to the entire team as a unit to not concede.'

The 44-year-old also heaped praise on the Delhi supporters, hailing them as the 'best around'.

'At the end of the game we go over to them and thank them for coming, regardless of a win, loss or draw. 

'We look forward to the next match in Kochi among the 50,000 fans. I recommend you bring some earplugs for the game.'
