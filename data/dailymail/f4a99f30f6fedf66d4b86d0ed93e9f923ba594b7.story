Toro Rosso teenage prodigy Max Verstappen has earned lavish praise from all within the team following his first proper day behind the wheel.

The 16-year-old, announced as a driver for next season by the Faenza-based squad last month, was left embarrassed a few days later when he crashed the car on a demonstration run in his native Rotterdam.

On Wednesday, in a bid to earn his superlicence necessary to compete in F1, Verstappen did not put a wheel out of place around the Adria International Raceway in north-eastern Italy.

Verstappen completed 148 laps of the circuit, clocking up just over 395 kilometres in a two-year-old car, enough to gain the superlicence, but more importantly earning the respect of his future employers.

Sporting director Steve Nielsen said: 'In his first real test in a Formula One car, Max did a very competent job.

'He gave the impression he has been driving a Formula One car for quite a while, not like someone on their first day behind the wheel.

'He made no mistakes all day, seemed confident, and once he was told something he remembered it. In general, he coped very well with this first test.'

Race engineer Xevi Pujolar added: 'We worked through various procedures that make up a race weekend. He was very focused and precise and learned quickly, without having to ask many questions.

'Once we were able to fit slicks (tyres), he got used to the car in the dry and built up his speed, while we tried various fuel levels, replicating both qualifying and race trim, doing a mix of short and long runs.

'For a first day, it was very impressive.'

As for Verstappen, he naturally savoured his experience, and is now itching to drive again, with the team planning a couple of runs in Friday practice sessions in the remaining grands prix this year.

Verstappen said: 'I was looking forward to my first drive in a Formula One car on a proper track and I really enjoyed it.

'It was a good opportunity to work with Xevi, who will be my race engineer next year, as well as having a chance to get used to all the buttons on the steering wheel.

'I think it went well and I can't wait to get back into a Formula One car as soon as possible.'
