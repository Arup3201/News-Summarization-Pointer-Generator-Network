Stephanie Sanpher died of meningitis in February four days after being taken into hospital following a two-hour delay by ambulance staff

A paramedic stopped to have a cigarette before arranging for an ambulance to take a dying teenager to hospital.

The unnamed crew member arrived in a rapid response vehicle to treat Stephanie Sanpher, 13, after she collapsed at home.

He wrongly assumed she was just upset after an argument at school, despite her mother Joanne pointing out red marks on her body – a classic sign of meningitis.

The paramedic then calmly smoked a cigarette in front of the Miss Sanpher, 37, before finally calling an ambulance – 41 minutes after he arrived. It then took a further 29 minutes for the ambulance to reach the house.

Stephanie went into cardiac arrest shortly after arriving at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King’s Lynn, and died four days later. A post-mortem examination revealed she had died from complications caused by acute meningococcal disease.

Miss Sanpher yesterday said she had asked East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust to take the paramedic off duty after her daughter’s death, but was told he had done everything necessary to treat ‘anxiety’.

Describing the paramedic’s visit, she said he had checked Stephanie upstairs before coming into the living room. ‘He obviously saw my e-cigarette on the side,’ she said. ‘He sparked up a fag, asked to use my landline and leant out of the window and dialled my GP.

‘He was more interested in telling me that she was putting this on and wanted attention rather than actually treating her.’

Miss Sanpher, who also has an 11-year-old son, said the paramedic simply told her to ‘cover up’ the lesions on her daughter’s body, before showing her photos of his own children. 

The single mother had rung 999 at 12.07pm on January 31 after her daughter collapsed at home in Dersingham, Norfolk, an inquest heard this week.

Stephanie was off school after the red marks appeared on her body and she complained of a sore throat. The paramedic arrived at 12.11pm and was told about a dispute she had had with another pupil.

The teenager, who was epileptic, had suffered a seizure but was conscious and the inquest heard she was not showing typical meningitis symptoms. Nonetheless, the delays meant she did not reach hospital until 1.31pm.

Her condition deteriorated rapidly and she had to be resuscitated following a heart attack. She was moved to Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge where she suffered another heart attack and died on February 4.

Norfolk coroner Jacqueline Lake recorded a verdict of death by natural causes on Monday. She also recommended that all response crews working for the trust carry equipment to test for meningitis and have refresher courses on the disease.

A spokesman for the trust said it was looking into the recommendations, adding that the paramedic ‘has been subject to disciplinary proceedings and supportive learning’. He also said it is ‘against policy’ for staff to smoke while attending a patient.
