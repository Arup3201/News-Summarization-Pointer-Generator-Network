Ireland are set to roar against France on Saturday with Joe Schmidt poised to recall three Test Lions to his starting line-up and add a fourth to the bench when he names his team on Thursday.

The Ireland head coach will recall Johnny Sexton, Sean O’Brien and Jamie Heaslip to the starting XV, while Cian Healy will be among the replacements.

However, it appeared Schmidt was willing to wait on a Wednesday night medical update (and this morning’s training session) before making a final call on whether to include yet another 2013 Lion in Ulster’s Rory Best.

Having comfortably seen off Italy in Rome, the Kiwi will be confident the inclusions of Sexton, Heaslip and O’Brien from the start — with Healy as a replacement — can give a timely boost to Ireland’s Six Nations title defence.

This Saturday will be Sexton’s first match of any kind since Ireland beat Australia 12 weeks ago, the out-half getting stood down in the interim by a French neurologist and ordered to rest following repeated concussion.

He will replace Ian Keatley, his Roman deputy, who slips out of the squad as Ian Madigan’s greater versatility across the back line means he will again provide this weekend’s No 10 bench cover.

Heaslip, who had been nursing a shoulder problem since the start of January, was left out for the game in Rome despite being declared fit in the latter part of last week.

But he will now return to his familiar No 8 role at the expense of Jordi Murphy after missing his first Six Nations match since 2011.

The inclusion of Sexton and Heaslip in today’s 2pm team announcement at Carton House will be no surprise, but Schmidt is willing to give O’Brien a second chance to play his first Test since November 2013 following last Saturday’s aborted comeback in Italy.

O’Brien, who twice had shoulder reconstruction surgery in 2014, had been chosen to start at Stadio Olimpico but pulled up lame in the pre-match warm-up with a tight hamstring, an 11th-hour development that resulted in Schmidt hurriedly promoting replacement Tommy O’Donnell to the starting line-up.

Like his Munster team-mate Keatley, O’Donnell has dropped from the starting XV in Rome out of the matchday squad entirely.

Healy, who trained fully on February 3 for the first time in 17 weeks following hamstring surgery, is poised to feature in his first Test since the title win in Paris last March — the loosehead taking over from James Cronin in the replacements.

And he may yet be joined on the bench by Best. The Ulster hooker has not trained fully since suffering a concussion in Rome last Saturday and must prove his readiness if he is to keep back-up Sean Cronin out of the No 2 shirt.

Meanwhile, France have made just one change from the side that laboured to a dull opening-round victory over Scotland last Saturday.

Head coach Philippe Saint-Andre has replaced injured loosehead Alexandre Menini with Eddy Ben Arous, Sexton’s Top 14 team-mate at Racing Metro.

Vincent Debaty comes onto the bench, where he will likely be used as a late impact substitute.
