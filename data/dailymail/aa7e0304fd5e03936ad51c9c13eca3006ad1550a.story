Dejan Lovren was cursing his luck on Twitter on Friday after failing to obtain a visa in time to join his new Liverpool team-mates on their tour of America.

The centre-back, who joined the Reds in a £20million move from Southampton, attended the U.S. embassy in London but was unable to obtain the mandatory visa before Liverpool head home from the States next week.

And he tweeted: 'l am disappointed that l can not be with the team #stupidvisa #YNWA'

Going nowhere: Liverpool's Dejan Lovren has been unable to ontain a visa for the Reds' tour of America

Speaking to Croatian sports newspaper Sportske novosti, Lovren said: 'Unfortunately I could not get a visa straight away. 

'Therefore I can not join my team-mates in the U.S. I am sad because of that.'

The 25-year-old, who was told he would have had to wait 10 days for the necessary visa, will instead train with the Under 21s until the Liverpool first-team returns to Merseyside.

'Of course it's not good that I have not joined the team's preparations in the U.S.' said the defender.

'However, I have plenty of days until their return from the tour.

'I will train with the Under 21 team in Liverpool. Brendan Rodgers will send a programme for me to practice.' 

All smiles: Lovren joined Liverpool in a £20million move from Southampton earlier this month

Lovren has joined former Southampton team-mates Rickie Lambert and Adam Lallana at Anfield this summer while manager Rodgers has also signed Benfica wideman Lazar Markovic and Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Emre Can following Luis Suarez's £75million departure to Barcelona.

The Reds take on Premier League rivals Manchester City in New York on Wednesday.
