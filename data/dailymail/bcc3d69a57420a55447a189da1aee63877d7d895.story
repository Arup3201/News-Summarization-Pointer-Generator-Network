Hugh Grant announced on Twitter that he was the proud father of a new baby boy

In a candid interview he explained that he liked his daughter 'very much', but said that she hasn’t changed his life.

He said in March last year: '(People) said never let anyone know, but the baby period is not that exciting. But I am excited, actually.

'I thought, well, I'll bluff through - but very little bluffing has been required.

'I like my daughter very much. Fantastic. Has she changed my life? I'm not sure. Not yet. Not massively, no. But I'm absolutely thrilled to have had her, I really am.

'And I feel a better person. There probably is some truth that one of our main functions on the planet is to reproduce, because it feels like more of an achievement than it should do.'

Grant has starred in films including About A Boy and Notting Hill.

The
 actor, who has never married, dated Elizabeth Hurley for 13 years 
before they split in 2000, five years after he was caught cheating with

It's not the first time the popular actor has taken to Twitter to talk about his private life.

In December he admitted he was a 'pain in the a**' during an appearance on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.

He made a very public confession by taking to his Twitter account and wrote: 'Turns out my inner crab got the better of me with TV producer in 09.

'Unforgivable. J Stewart correct to give me kicking.'

The Music and Lyrics actor was blasted by Stewart for being rude to his staff and Jon says he will never be invited back.

Speaking at a fundraiser for the Montclair Film Festival in New Jersey last year,  the presenter said: 'He's giving everyone s*** the whole time, and he's a big pain in the a**. And we've had dictators on the show.
