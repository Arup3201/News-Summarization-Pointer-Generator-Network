Prolific: Nigella Lawson is continuously sharing pictures of meals out with followers on Twitter

It is a commonplace sight in Britain’s high-end restaurants.

A customer, delighted with their meal, photographs their plate of food and posts it on Twitter.

The snapshots are sometimes labelled ‘food porn’ by their aficionados.

But far from enjoying the free publicity, agitated French chefs have pledged to ban cameras in their restaurants, claiming it is the height of bad manners and an infringement of their ‘intellectual property’.

A group of top chefs have criticised diners for ruining the surprise for future diners and tipping off rivals about their food presentation.

Chef Alexandre Gauthier, 34, who runs the Grenouillere restaurant in La Madelaine-sous-Montreuil, in northern France, said diners often appeared more interested in photographing their food than eating it.

He has now introduced menus with a picture of a camera with a line through it to dissuade diners from posting photos of their food on social networking sites.

He said: ‘They used to come and take pictures of themselves and their family, their grandmother, whoever, as a souvenir.

'Now they take pictures of the food, they put it on Facebook or Twitter, they comment. And then the food is cold.’

Mr Gauthier said he had seen customers rearrange tables in order to capture their food at the best angle, before setting off a stream of flashes from their camera.

He added: ‘I would like people to be living in the present. Tweet about the meal beforehand, tweet about it afterwards, but in between stop and eat.’

Gilles Goujon, who runs a three Michelin-starred restaurant, L’Auberge du Vieux Puits, in Fontjoncouse, in southern France, said: ‘If people take a photo and put it out on social media, it takes away the surprise.

Robin Lawley recently posed pictures of her meal to Instagram - a practice which French chefs are trying to ban

‘It takes away a little bit of my intellectual property too. Someone could copy me.

‘Plus a photo taken on an average smartphone is rarely a great image. It doesn’t give the best impression of our work. It’s annoying.’

He complained that his signature dish ‘oeuf de poule pourri de truffles’, chicken egg laden with truffles, was now often pictured on social media.

Mr Goujon said he wanted to ban the practice but did not want to appear rude himself.

‘It’s difficult to forbid it. I’m looking for a sentence to write but I haven’t yet found the right words that won’t be too shocking’, he said.

Several restaurants in New York have already banned mobile phones for the same reason.

Michel Roux Jr, head chef of the two Michelin-starred Le Gavroche in Mayfair, central London, has also previously criticised the practice.

He said: ‘It should be flattering, but it annoys me when I see people taking photos of their food.

‘It’s disruptive for the people around them and it spoils that person’s enjoyment of the meal. Personally, I think it’s incredibly poor manners.’

One chef says he has seen diners move tables to take a picture, ruining the atmosphere for other diners

But it seems not all British chefs agree with their French counterparts.

Nigella Lawson tweets pictures of her food non-stop, including when she is dining out.

She previously took a photograph of herself at Scott’s in Mayfair, writing: ‘Lunchtime treat at Scott’s restaurant – oysters! 3 Cornish natives & 3 West Mersea natives. Glorious.’

Scott’s would later be the scene of her infamous contretemps with former husband Charles Saatchi.

Meanwhile, rapper Professor Green tweeted pictures of each of the courses of his £195 meal at the Fat Duck while on a date with his now-wife, Millie Mackintosh.

His wife also regularly tweets about her food and posted a photograph of a fish dish at 202 London, in Notting Hill, describing it as a ‘dream’.

Television presenter Philip Schofield is also a fan of food tweets, and posted a photo himself eating the ‘sound of the sea’ from the tasting menu at Heston Blumenthal’s Fat Duck restaurant in Bray, Berks, during a meal to celebrate his brother’s birthday.
