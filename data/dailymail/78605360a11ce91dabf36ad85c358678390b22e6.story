The cost of having a PO Box address is to rise by a staggering 30 per cent tomorrow – hitting small businesses, charities and sports clubs.

Consumer groups say they have only just found out about the increase from £170 to £222 as the news was buried in the small print when the Royal Mail announced price hikes for stamps, which also come into effect tomorrow.

The latest rise means that the annual cost of a PO Box has soared almost fourfold since 2009, when it cost just  £62 a year.

Hikes: Royal Mail has increased the cost of sending post to a PO Box fourfold since 2009

Consumer watchdog Which? said: ‘Many people use PO Boxes to keep their business and personal correspondence separate.

'They have been stunned by  the size of the increase.’

One reader of Which? wrote: ‘This is frankly obscene! I feel like I have  been attacked, mobbed.

'I do understand that prices need to go up, and usually  do go up, but by this much? This is outrageous.’

Royal Mail says it has lost £1 billion on its core postal business over the past  four years as it is delivering fewer  letters but to more addresses.

Part of the price rise on PO Boxes is due to the introduction of VAT on the service.

The Royal Mail admitted the rise would be ‘difficult’ but said: ‘We have thought very carefully about the impact on our customers and on our own business.’

Meanwhile stores are bracing themselves for a last-minute rush to buy stamps today, before the cost of  first-class postage rises from 46p to 60p, and second-class from 36p to 50p.

Going up: Royal Mail is to be given the freedom to set its own prices for first-class stamps

The hikes come after an overhaul of the rules governing Royal Mail, which the Government plans to privatise from 2013, was announced by communications regulator Ofcom.

It follows an Ofcom consultation from October, last year, which endorsed the removal of price constrictions.

The Ofcom changes actually mean Royal Mail can charge as much as it likes for first class stamps, while second class stamps have been capped at 55p at today's prices, rising with inflation - a potential 53 per increase.

As the nation's 'Universal Service Provider' of postal services, Royal Mail will continue to be constrained on what it can charge for second class post - but at 55p, Ofcom has set the cap at the very top end of the price range put forward in the October consultation.

The cap, which can rise with inflation each year, will extend to second class small parcel and large letters up to 2kg in weight.

The overhaul has been prompted by a financial crisis at Royal Mail. The service, which is currently owned by the state, has faced increased competition from private delivery firms and a collapse in postal demand as individuals and businesses move to electronic communications, including email and social media.  

Moya Greene, chief executive of Royal Mail, said in March this year:  'We know how hard it is for households and businesses when our economy is as tough as it is now. No-one likes to raise prices in the current economic climate but, regretfully, we have no option.

'Royal Mail has lost £1 billion over the last four years; the sustainability of the service is now at risk. Price increases are needed to return the Universal Service to sustainability.'
