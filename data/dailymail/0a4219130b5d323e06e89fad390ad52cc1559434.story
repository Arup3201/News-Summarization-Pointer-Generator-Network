What would happen if the moon was replaced by various planets in the sky?

One YouTube user has taken a look at this hypothetical scenario - and the results are rather impressive.

In a video they show how moving the planets closer would fill our sky with stunning views - and it reveals just how large some of the planets are compared to the moon.

A YouTube user from Alabama has illustrated planets in the night sky (Saturn shown). They illustrated how the planets would look in the moon's position. The video reveals how large some would appear in hypothetical scenario. If it did happen, it's unlikely Earth would survive the close encounters

The video was created by YouTube user Yeti Dynamics.

‘This is a visualization of what it might be like if the Moon was replaced with some of the other planets at the same distance as our moon,’ they explain.

Moon: 1,080 miles (1,738km)

Mars: 2,111 miles (3,397km)

Venus: 3,761 miles (6,052km)

Neptune (equatorial): 15,701 miles (25,269km)

Uranus (equatorial): 15,882 miles (25,559km) 

Saturn (equatorial, not including rings): 37,449 miles (60,268km)

Jupiter (equatorial): 44,422 miles (71,490km) 

In order the video shows Mars, Venus, Neptune, Uranus, Jupiter and Saturn in place of the moon.

Mercury is purposefully left off as it is a similar size to the moon ‘and hence is boring.’

With our moon measuring a paltry 1,738km in radius, the other planets dwarf it in size when shown in its position about 240,000 miles (384,000km) from Earth.

Mars, for instance, is about twice the size, with a radius of 1,080 miles (3,397km).

Uranus is about 25 times larger at 15,882 miles (25,559km) in radius, while Jupiter completely outclasses it with a radius of 44,422 miles 71,490km).

Interestingly, some of the moons of the planets would also be in a collision course with Earth.

Dione, for example, which orbits Saturn at a distance of 235,000 miles (377,000km), would likely impact Earth if Saturn were in place of the moon.

Here Saturn is seen, pictured by Voyager 1 in 1980, with its moons Tethys (bottom left) and Dione (middle). If Saturn were in the position of the moon, it's likely that Dione would impact Earth at some point - although of course the scenario is only hypothetical

Another interesting effect would be the gravitational influence on Earth if the planets were placed that close.

They could strip away our atmosphere and cause huge tides and volcanoes.

If Jupiter were the planet in the moon's position, it’s likely Earth would not even survive intact, being close enough to possibly be ripped apart and form a ring around the gas giant.

A second video also reveals what the moon would look like if it were in the position of the ISS.

 

With our moon measuring a paltry 1,738km in radius, the other planets dwarf it in size when shown in its position about 240,000 miles (384,000km) from Earth (illustration shown)

At an orbital height of just 255 miles (415km), the ISS is relatively close to Earth.

But place the moon there and it would fill most of the sky as Earth rotates, blocking out the sun and sending the planet into darkness for long portions.

Of course, all of these scenarios are merely hypothetical and just a light-hearted look at the solar system.

But they do help to illustrated the different sizes of objects in Earth’s vicinity.
