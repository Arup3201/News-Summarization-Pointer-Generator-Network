Three Chinese separatists who were involved in an a knife attack that killed 31 people at a train station last year have been executed.

The three men, Iskandar Ehet, Turgun Tohtunyaz and Hasayn Muhammad were all put to death for their role in the attack at Kuming railway station, which also saw more than 140 people wounded.

The Supreme People's Court confirmed that the executions had taken place after the men were convicted of 'leading a terrorist organisation and intentional homicide' in September.

The attack also left 141 people injured and Chinese state run media dubbed the incident as 'China's 9/11' 

China uses both lethal injection and firing squad for executions, but the method used this time was not specified.

The attack in Kunming, in the south western province of Yunnan, was dubbed as 'China's 9/11' by state-run media.

Dressed in black and wielding long knives and machetes, several assailants stormed the station on March 1, 2014 seemingly hacking at anyone in sight.

Distressing photos circulating online showed bodies, pools of blood and abandoned luggage scattered across the terminal floor in the wake of what authorities termed an 'organised, premeditated, violent terrorist attack'.

A female attacker, Patigul Tohti, was pregnant at the time of her arrest and was sentenced to life in prison.

Police shot four other assailants dead at the time of incident.

Beijing blamed the attack on 'separatists' from the resource-rich far western Xinjiang region, where at least 200 people have died in attacks and clashes between locals and security forces over the last year.

The remote autonomous region, which borders Central Asia, is home to the mostly Muslim Uighur minority.

But campaign groups have accused China of preventing the men from having a fair trial.

Dilxat Raxit, a spokesman for the Munich-based World Uyghur Congress said: 'China is using the death penalty for political means in order to avoid the root cause of the problem.'

'The defendants did not get a dignified trial and China used this event to incite discrimination against Uighurs.'

However, China has vowed to step up punishment of 'violent terrorists', and is drafting its first-ever anti-terrorism law.

Chinese courts convicted 712 people on terrorism-related charges last year, an increase of more than 13 per cent, according to chief justice Zhou Qiang.

The country executes more people than the rest of the world combined, according to rights organisations, and put an estimated 2,400 people to death in 2013.
