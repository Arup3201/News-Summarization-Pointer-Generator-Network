Each August 9, socialite, fiction writer and former countess Ava Roosevelt pauses to thank fate for keeping her from the house of actress Sharon Tate on the night she was brutally murdered by the Manson Family.

Roosevelt is convinced that if it weren't for a malfunction in her silver Rolls Royce and an early morning photo shoot that prevented her from attending Tate's party, she would have become Manson's sixth victim that fateful night.

The former wife of a French count, Mia Farrow's brother, President Franklin Roosevelt's grandson and a steel heir sat down this week for an interview with the New York Post to talk about her brush with death on the eve of the 45th anniversary of the Manson massacre. 

Lucky: Ava Roosevelt, 66, a one-time model and author, has opened up about how she escaped being killed inside the home of Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski in August 1969 by the Manson sect 

Life-saving malfunction: Roosevelt said a faulty gas gauge on her 1955 Rolls Roiyce Silver Down (similar to the one pictured) kept her from driving to Sharon Tate's party in Beverly Hills on August 9, 1969

Roosevelt, who was close friends with director Roman Polanski and his wife, Sharon Tate, had been invited to the couple's mansion in Beverly Hills on August 9, 1969, just hours before Manson's cohorts descended on the house, slaying the heavily pregnant actress and four others.

'I've always said to myself how incredibly lucky I am,' she told the Post. 

Roosevelt, 66, was 19 years old at the time of the murders. She described the 26-year-old Tate as her 'older sister.'

‘The last words Sharon said to me were “I love you and come to see me. Try to come after dinner.” She sounded happy,’ Roosevelt recalled.

Tragic: Tate, whom Roosevelt described as her big sister, was stabbed to death 16 times by Manson's followers

But a faulty gas gauge on Roosevelt’s 1955 Rolls Royce Silver Dawn spoiled her plan to attend the gathering.

The following morning, the 19-year-old model also had an early morning screen test for Alberto VO5 commercial, so Roosevelt decided to stay at home.

What happened next inside the Polanski-Tate home has been well-documented: cult leader Charles Manson's followers entered the mansion and one by one slaughtered Tate, Vojtek Frykowski, Gibby Folger, Jay Sebring and Stephen Parent.

The next day, the murderous gang dispatched businessman Leno La Bianca and his wife, Rosemary, in their Los Angeles home.

Roman Polanski was away in London at the time of the murders. When he returned, Roosevelt said  the young husband and father-to-be was utterly devastated.

‘He was barely standing up. I have never seen anyone grieving like that,’ she recalled.

Looking back on the notorious cult killings, Roosevelt said her very close call left her a changed woman.

Ms Roosevelt has spent the past half-century traveling the world, with sojourns in Poland, Paris, New York and the Bahamas.

Living life to the fullest: Roosevelt, pictured left and right with documentarian Wendy Lee, was the wife of a French count, a steel heir, Mia Farrow's brother and FDR's grandson; she traveled the world, got an education from the Sorbonne and wrote a novel in 2011

She currently divides her time between Norfolk, Connecticut, and Palm Beach, Florida.

In 2011, the Sorbonne- and Columbia-educated ex-countess published a romantic thriller titled The Racing Heart about a supermodel who finds herself embroiled in a plot to kill the president to the United States.
