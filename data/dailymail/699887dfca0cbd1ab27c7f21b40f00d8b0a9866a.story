The South Carolina woman who drove into the sea in an alleged attempt to kill her three children also tried to harm her unborn child, a court in Florida heard.

Ebony Wilkerson, who is 28 weeks pregnant, was seen ‘beating her stomach with her fists’ after her arrest.

The 32-year-old was taken to a psychiatric ward where she has been kept for observation after being sectioned under the Baker Act.

'Dangerous': Pregnant Ebony Wilkerson, seen at her bail hearing on Monday March 17, allegedly 'punched her stomach with her fists' after her arrest

Details of the latest violence came at a bond hearing for Wilkerson.

She has been charged with attempted murder after driving her minivan into the ocean at Daytona Beach, Florida.

Her three children, aged three, nine and 10, were rescued by witnesses and lifeguards.

Authorities said Wilkerson, who had driven from her home in South Carolina, deliberately drove into the ocean while her three kids were strapped inside.

Details of her attempt to harm her unborn child came from State Attorney R.J. Larizza who said Wilkerson was taken to a psychiatric ward when she was seen ‘beating her stomach with her fists’ after her arrest.

He told a court her unborn child was at risk saying she was ‘helpless’.

Chief Assistant Public Defender Craig S. Dyer suggested Wilkerson's actions resulted from inhumane conditions.

He said at the time she was being held naked in an isolation cell.

Dyer argued that Wilkerson should have her $1.2m bond suspended and she should be admitted to Halifax Health for care.

‘I believe that Mrs. Wilkerson can be helped,’ said Dr. James Moore, a psychiatrist. He described Wilkerson's detention as so restrictive that it will complicate mental health treatment.

‘She's limited in her ability even for such things as getting fresh air,’

The judge also heard from Dr. Pamela Carbiener, an obstetrics and gynecology specialist, who said Wilkerson's pregnancy is complicated by several factors and she has risk factors for premature birth.

‘I think she has significant high-risk issues,’ Carbiener said.

Judge Leah Case declined to release Wilkerson to the hospital.

According to the Orlando Sentinel, she set a March 25 follow-up hearing, inviting the defense to provide case law supporting its proposal.

Wilkerson's family has said she drove into the water days after leaving her husband, following 14 years of abuse in South Carolina.

Her children have told investigators she had been behaving erratically since arriving in Florida.

Tourists on the beach caught the horrifying ordeal on camera, and the footage shows that Wilkerson was physically able to escape the vehicle.

In video taken by Simon Besner, a 
tourist from Canada, the woman can be seen outside the van as lifeguards
 try to pull her children from the vehicle.

Witnesses
 described her hopping out of the car window as her screaming children 
remained seat-belted in the back. Waves nearly pushed her 
under the van.

'It was a bit terrifying,' said Besner.

Never again: Doug Krane never thought he'd hear Wilkerson's name again after his wife's death - then she allegedly tried to kill her children

Survivor: Krane's infant son survived the crash that claimed the life of his young mother

Krane says last week's incident could have been prevented if Wilkerson had been held responsible for the wreck that killed his wife

In the video, several men frantically 
try to get to the third and youngest child through the hatchback and the driver's 
side door as waves lap over the front of the minivan.

The small child is eventually pulled to safety.

Another tourist described watching with horror.

'My
 friend pointed out that there was a car getting really close to the 
beach and actually started driving on the water,' Taylor Quintin 
visiting the area from Vermont told Local 6.

'I saw a kid in the back waving his arms around screaming, 'Help us! Help us!' And the car kept going deeper.'

'That's
 when I saw a guy from the beach run over next to the car and take out 
two small children and walk them back up. Another guy ran out and 
brought a little toddler out of the car'.

Many added that there was no way the incident was an accident.

Leonard
 R. Ross, an attorney representing Wilkerson's husband, Lutful Ronjon, 
released the following statement late Monday: ‘My client continues to 
pray for his wife's wellbeing and sincerely hopes that mental health 
professionals will address her issues.’

Last week is was revealed that Wilkerson had been involved in a car crash that claimed a woman's life in 2007.

Evidence: Ebony Wilkerson's car (right) can be seen veering from the sand toward the ocean

Police say Wilkerson, who is pregnant, locked the doors of her 2012 Honda Odyssey, put up the windows and told her three frightened children - ages 3, 9 and 10 - to close their eyes and go to sleep as she drove into the ocean

Rescue: The dramatic moment the children were plucked to safety was filmed by Simon Besner

Race against time: The rescuers managed to grab all the children from the car as it was submerged in the surf

Jennifer
 Krane, had just given birth when she and husband Dough were slammed 
into by Ebony Wilkerson on a freeway near Fort Lauderdale.

On
 the day of the deadly wreck, Wilkerson was going northbound on Interstate 
95 when she switched lanes and slammed into the rear of a Nissan 
operated by Doug Krane, who was driving with his wife and infant son in the car.

The
 impact sent Krane's car skidding across the road and into a concrete 
barrier. Jennifer Krane suffered critical injuries in the collision and 
died several days later.

Wilkerson
 was cited for improper lane change, lost her license for a year and was
 ordered to serve 132 hours of community service, according to court 
records.

Doug Krane told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell
 that if Wilkerson had been punished more severely for the wreck that 
killed his wife, perhaps last week's incident could have been avoided.

'I
 didn't think id ever hear her name again,' Krane said of the news that 
Wilkerson allegedly had tried to kill her children. 'I was shocked, and 
when I first found it was her it did bring tears to my eyes because 
something could have been done earlier.'

Krane describes Wilkerson as 'weaving in and out of traffic' before hitting his vehicle from behind.

'She
 got into the lane to the right of us and somehow got a little bit 
behind us and then...like you see on cops, she hit us from right behind 
the back right tire and did like the pit maneuver and instead of 
stopping on the spot she tried to keep going,' he said 'I think the only
 reason she ended up stopping was because her car wouldn't go anywhere.'

'But
 then when she got to the hospital she wasn't very nice to anybody,' he 
said. 'They said she was the nastiest person they'd ever dealt with.'
