A chain of clinics has been found guilty of misleading women by claiming it could detect early signs of breast cancer with its thermal imaging screening service.

Breast Angels, based in Liverpool, operates seven clinics across the country offering thermal image body scans to detect a range of abnormalities.

The firm’s website highlights the fact that at least one woman used the breast screening results to opt for homeopathic treatment for cancer rather than surgery to remove a tumour.

Breast Angels, based at the Homeopathic Clinic in Crosby, Liverpool, claimed its thermal scans could detect breast cancer, but an advertising watchdog says it has no evidence to support it

The firm ran an advertisement for its Medical Thermal Imaging, which offered  ‘100% Safe Breast Screening’.

The text added: ‘Thermography can detect active breast abnormality before it’s possible with mammography ...  Medically recognised’.

The advertisement in the What Doctors Don’t Tell You magazine backed up its message for worried women by carrying a banner which stated ‘Breast Cancer Awareness Month’.

The company claims that its thermography screening is more effective than the mammography used by NHS doctors to detect cancer.

Its ad also boasted it is a safer because it does not involve using radiation to screen the breast.

The company said abnormalities associated with an early cancer releases nitrous oxide into the body which can be picked up by its thermal image scanners.

The firm argued that because this process occurs early in the development of a cancer it would not be picked up by mammography.

However, the company was unable to provide any medical evidence or studies to back up its claims.

The ASA said: ‘Because the advertiser did not provide robust evidence to substantiate the claim that thermography could detect active breast abnormalities which also compared its efficacy with mammography or that it was medically recognised, we concluded the ad was misleading.’

It ruled: ‘The ad must not appear again in its current form.  We told Medical Thermal Imaging Ltd to hold robust evidence before making efficacy claims.’

Medical Thermal Imaging charges women £195 for two breast screening sessions three months apart which are designed to measure any changes. The results are sent to doctors in the USA to be assessed.

Phillip Hughes and his wife Rosa, who are both trained as clinical thermographers, travel to seven clinics around the country to carry out screenings.

Mr Hughes rejected the ASA assessment process as ‘unfair’.

He said: ‘We provided them with a long list of medical studies and papers demonstrating that thermal imaging for breast screening works, but they do not have a single medically-qualified expert who can properly assess these.’

Mr Hughes insisted his company has successfully identified early onset of cancer in women who would be too young to be given the mammograms normally carried out by the NHS.

Routine mammograms are offered to women over 50.

Leading breast cancer surgeon Professor Kefah Mokbel said ‘Based on research to date, there is no evidence whatsoever that thermal imaging is effective in screening for breast cancer and it should be discouraged.’

Prof Mokbel, who works at St George’s Hospital, London and the London Breast Institute, said there was a danger that women would be falsely reassured by negative results and deterred from using proven screening methods.

‘The scientific community regard this as an invalid tool in screening for breast cancer’ he added.
