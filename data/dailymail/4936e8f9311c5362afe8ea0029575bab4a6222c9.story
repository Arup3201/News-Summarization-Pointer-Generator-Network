Death's door: Connor Holloway, 14, lay unconscious for nearly 12 hours in a hospital's high dependency ward after collapsing just seconds after taking a legal high called Sensate

A mother has released this distressing photograph of her 14-year-old son as he lay unconscious in a hospital fighting for his life after taking a legal high.

Doctors feared Connor Holloway could stop breathing at any moment as he remained in a coma-like state for nearly 12 hours.

The schoolboy from Southampton, Hampshire, had been rushed to hospital after he collapsed within seconds of smoking a legal high called Sensate.

His distraught mother Emma Holloway, who constantly remained at his bedside, said she had feared the worst when her son started suffering fits and his heart rate plummeted.

Miss Holloway had earlier received a phone call from Connor’s friend who said he had fallen ill at his house on Saturday after taking a legal high which had been bought from a headshop in Southampton.

The 33-year-old said: ‘I went inside and found him collapsed on the floor. He was lifeless. I thought he would come round but he didn’t.’

Connor was rushed to Southampton General Hospital in Hampshire by ambulance where he was treated in the high dependency ward.

The mother-of-five added: ‘Doctors were talking about putting him into a medicated coma.

‘They feared he may have brain damage and could not give a time scale of when he would wake up.’

Connor said he experimented with the drug, bought in a shop called Up in Smoke in Southampton by his friend’s 23-year-old sibling, because he thought its legal status meant it was safe.

But within a few moments he began feeling unwell.

The schoolboy said: ‘I only had a tiny bit. It was instant - I just felt sick and fuzzy and could not see properly.

‘I went downstairs to put my head under the tap and that was the last thing I remember.’

Warning: Connor's mother Emma has released the distressing image of her son in hospital to draw attention to the dangers of legal highs

His next memory was waking up nearly 12 hours later in hospital.

After the distressing incident, Mrs Holloway is demanding that controversial ‘legal highs’ - which killed 99 people in Britain last year - are banned.

She has spoken out about her son’s potentially fatal ordeal in the hope of warning others about the dangers of legal highs.

‘When I realise how close he came to dying it is shocking and I feel so angry.

‘I can’t believe how dangerous it is. It should be banned immediately,’ she said.

‘It needs to stop because the next person is not going to be as lucky as Connor.’

Following the incident, Jaz Singh, who runs Up in Smoke, said he would remove the drug from his shelves.

He claimed that Sensate was actually an air freshener and that there was a warning on the packet marked ‘not for human consumption’.

Mr Singh added: ‘I have been selling the product for six months and have not had any problems.’

‘We run a strict over-18s policy and challenge anyone under 25. I will be taking it off the shelves and will not be selling that product.’

However, Maryon Stewart, whose 21-year-old daughter Hester died after taking a legal high, said that legal high shops like Up In Smoke needed to be shut down immediately.

Mrs Stewart, who set up the Angelus Foundation to raise awareness about the dangers of legal highs, said ‘They are taking us all for fools. They are making a mint while young people gamble with their lives.

‘The packets say ‘Not for Human Consumption’ but these shops also sell every kind of smoking device. It is high time this vile trade was removed from our high streets.’

There are hundreds of head shops which have sprung up in high streets in recent years and there are around 690 online sellers based in Britain.

In England, 6,486 people were treated in 2011-12 for abusing legal highs, an increase of 39 per cent compared with five years previously.

Deaths involving legal highs in England and Wales increased by 80 per cent last year from 29 in 2011 to 52 in 2012 - one every week -with a further 47 deaths in Scotland.

Despite the growing number of deaths the government appears powerless to act and campaigners warn that a new legal high hits our streets every week.

In the past three years, more than 150 new substances have emerged and are widely available online and in high street shops, but struggling authorities have managed to ban just one in ten.
