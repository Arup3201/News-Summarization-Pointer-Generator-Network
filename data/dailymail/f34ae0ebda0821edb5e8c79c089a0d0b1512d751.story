Over the next couple of weeks, and especially when England play Costa Roca in Belo Horizonte on June 24, you will hear a lot about a game played in the same city which is seen as the biggest World Cup shock of all time – USA 1-0 England in 1950. In particular you will hear the name Joe Gaetjens.

I spent a lot of time researching this particular game for my book ‘Is He All That?’ and concluded that while the FA let the national team down, it’s a result that should never have stood.

The circumstances of the game render it meaningless in my view and in no way should the result be regarded as the biggest upset in football history.

Disaster: England goalkeeper Bert Williams looks on helplessly as he is beaten by Joe Gaetjens

Horror: Sir Alf Ramsey (right) played as England suffered an embarrassing 1-0 defeat at the hands of the USA

Firstly let’s assess the England team at that time – they were brilliant. In 1948 they went to Italy and won 4-0 in Turin against the double world champions. It was so easy that Stanley Matthews stood in the corner with the ball at his feet and combed his hair with his hands as he waited for the well-beaten Italians to challenge him.

But in Brazil two years later, the pomposity of the FA at that time was so out of control they decided to send Matthews – comfortably England’s best player – to an exhibition tour of north America rather than take him to the World Cup.

So Matthews sailed to Canada for the first ‘showpiece’ game, then took the train to New York for the second match, but he was injured. The FA XI beat a USA national team 1-0, an ironic contrast to what would happen later in Belo Horizonte. He then flew to Brazil via Trinidad.

Having missed England’s first ever World Cup match - they beat Chile 2-0 - Matthews then sat in the stands in Belo Horizonte to watch the USA defeat.

The Grimsby fishmonger Arthur Drewry picked the team in his role as FA selector (he would later become a FIFA president). Seemingly the main thing the England manager Walter Winterbottom did at the World Cup was don an apron and teach the chefs at the Luxor Hotel in Rio how to fry eggs after they had served up a black and burnt mess on a plate to the players.

But the FA’s buffoonery was not the reason this result was a joke.

Three of the victorious players did not have USA citizenship, including the goalscorer Gaetjens. FIFA allowed them to play on the promise that they would all get citizenship after the tournament. However, the USA captain that day Ed McIlvenny failed to ever become a US citizen. To make it worse for England, he was Scottish.

As a bizarre aside, Scotland qualified but refused to go to this World Cup because they had failed to win the Home Championship after a fortunate England win at Hampden Park.

These ‘ringers’ were brought in when the Americans realised they had a team that was likely to be humiliated at the World Cup. In 1948, when England went to Italy and won 4-0, the USA had lost to the Italians 9-0. They had actually been semi-finalists in 1930 and wanted to protect that proud history - not be remembered for embarrassing results.

So they hunted for good players whether they were American or not. Gaetjens was from Haiti. He was found washing pots and studying in Brooklyn, and he only met his World Cup team-mates two days before they travelled to the tournament.

The goal itself was a joke: Walter Bahr hit an awful shot - some thought it was a cross – which was one of only two efforts they had in the 90 minutes, and according to most accounts of the game I’ve read, it hit the oblivious Gaetjens on the back of the head and went in. Alf Ramsey played in the game and said: ‘He (Gaetjens) ducked to avoid the ball.’

Three-and-a-half years after scoring that goal Gaetjens played in a World Cup qualifier for the country of his birth Haiti. So much for being an American citizen.

It was a crazy result, and it is wheeled out as some sort of symbol of English uselessness when there are far better examples of that from World Cup history; the whole 2010 campaign under Fabio Capello springs to mind. It was a lucky win for the USA - their goalkeeper Frank Borghi literally never kicked a ball in the game, because he was useless with his feet; England hit the bar at least five times. It was a watershed for the English FA’s superior attitude (this was the first World Cup they bothered to enter) and the USA team had a few ringers.

Even though I believe the result shouldn’t have stood, and by fielding non-US citizens I believe the Americans cheated, I am glad that Gaetjens is seen as the hero. His life ended in tragedy. His family were members of the Haitian aristocracy, and when the dictator Papa Doc Duvalier tightened his grip on the country, his vicious army, the Tonton Macoutes, snatched Gaetjens as he started a day’s work at the dry-cleaning business he owned.

He was taken to Fort Dimanche, the notorious prison where inmates were tortured - sometimes sexually - and murdered. It is widely believed that ‘men were sent there to die’. It was a torture and death chamber, where 40 men were crowded into rooms measuring just a few square feet. They ate gruel off the floor, and they drank only the water they were hosed down with.

One American journalist said this: ‘Most men do not leave Fort Dimanche; if they are not beaten to death they die of tuberculosis, dysentery, or having the blood sucked from them by scores of vermin.’His relatives never heard from him again. It is believed he is one of the 30,000 or more executed by Papa Doc.

So hail Gaetjens as a hero, but bear in mind the context and circumstances of that USA victory over England in Belo Horizonte in 1950.
