A senior citizens' center told MailOnline today that it has tried to lure a group of troublesome pensioners away from a branch of McDonald's where they have spending sunrise to sunset hogging booths - but that they refuse to leave. 

President of the Flushing Senior Center Kwang Kim said on Wednesday that he provides coffee and snacks for the senior citizens 
from 8.30am to 5pm every day but that 'they don't come'.

Staff at the McDonald's franchise in New York are becoming increasingly frustrated with the Korean pensioners who pass hours gossiping at the window-seat tables amid piles of newspapers but buying very little. Some of the gang eat meals at the seniors' center - then head for the golden arches.

A McDonald's branch in Flushing, Queens is battling a group of elderly Koreans whom they say hog the tables for hours on end but buy very little

Mr Kim even undercuts McDonald's budget prices by asking just a 25c donation for the refreshments.

He
 said: 'I think they like it [McDonald's] because it allows them to have
 their own chats away from the senior center. It gives them independence
 and freedom.'

Management 
have been forced to call police to move on the ever-evolving group as 
they are driving away business. Some customers have asked for refunds 
because there is nowhere to sit.

Sun Kim, 64, who was enjoying a coffee, fries and reading newspapers with a group of six friends in McDonald's, told MailOnline that she understood it was bad for business but that they needed a place to go.

She said: 'It is open so early and stays open until after dark when it's late. It's warm and the old people like to have a place to meet and talk together.'

The elderly Koreans' allegiance to 
the neon-lit branch is especially peculiar because of the other options 
available to the chatty seniors.

The elderly patrons return to the McDonald's because they enjoy the long opening hours and find it convenient, patrons said today

The Korean
 Community Service Center in Flushing also offers breakfast and lunch for the
 elderly every day along with language and exercise classes.

Mr 
Kim said that although he understands that McDonald's must have trade, some seniors told him that the fast-food joint wants them to 
drink their coffee in 20 minutes which he thinks is too short a time 
period for elderly people.

The
 president also offered to provide buses for groups of elderly people to
 join them at the seniors' center which has locations in Flushing and 
Corona.

However Sun Kim told MailOnline that the senior center was not open for long enough to suit her and her friends' needs.

The battle between the pensioners and McDonald's has escalated over the past few months with the 
police receiving four 911 calls since November about the group.

A police source said that people usually leave when asked by officers without any problems.

The McDonald's in Flushing is the popular hang-out spot for some of the elderly Korean community in the area

However the defiant patrons admit that they just take a walk around the block and come back in again.

Police
 could prosecute patrons for trespassing if they refused to leave and 
the restaurant requested, but hope the matter could be worked out before
 that stage.

It appears that the group of men, and some women, are drawn to the McDonald's on the corner of Parsons and Northern Boulevards, because it offers a convenient meeting spot from their homes.

However beyond these reasons, many cannot explain why they love to meet at McDonald's so much.

Local people admit they bypass the location - which only has around ten booths and a few counter places - because there are never any seats.

Lynn Hall, who was pushing an elderly woman in wheelchair whom she cares for, said they head to a McDonald's further away because it is always so busy.

She says: 'Some people sit there all day long and and there's no room for the wheelchair.'

Flushing resident Miriam said: 'I think that place must do no business. People go there to read the  newspaper. I go shopping for two, three hours and it's always the same people sitting in the same places when I return.'

The elderly people sometimes alternate with a Burger 
King nearby on Northern Boulevard which has more space and community 
boards inside for customers in English, Chinese and Korean.

Jack Bert, who owns the Flushing McDonald's franchise, said in a statement: 
'I'm sure you can imagine any business would find this situation to be 
difficult when customers prevent other customers from enjoying the 
restaurant.

'We 
continue to work to resolve this situation and create an environment so 
customers who wish to enjoy this restaurant have the ability to do so.'
