A 16-year-old mother and her boyfriend shot dead a man during an attempted theft of a PlayStation the victim was trying to sell them after putting an advert on Craigslist.

The teenager's 16-moth-old baby was just a few feet away at the time of the botched robbery and shooting of 28-year-old Daniel John Zeitz in Sandy Springs, Georgia.

The girl, whose name has not been released, and Nathaniel Vivian, 20, met Mr Zeitz in an apartment parking lot, posing as potential buyers, after he advertised his PS4 on Craigslist.

Police said Vivian, who was in the driver's seat of the car, struggled with Mr Zeitz for the PlayStation while he was standing outside the vehicle.

During the struggle the girl fired a shot from a .25 caliber handgun, Atlanta Journal Constitution reported. The bullet passed through Vivian's hand and struck Mr Zeitz in the side of his chest, wounding him fatally.

The couple were later arrested when they went to Northside Hospital for treatment of Vivian's gunshot wound to the hand.

Sandy Springs police Sgt. Ron Momon said: 'Brookhaven police were at the hospital interviewing the injured man, who told them he was a victim of a crime in Brookhaven, but later told them he was shot while he and his girlfriend were at the Legends of Dunwoody Apartments to rob a man of his PS4 video gaming system that was advertised on Craigslist.'

Nathaniel Vivian, 20, is being held without bond in the Fulton County Jail following the shooting

'Detectives also learned that the juvenile's infant child, approximately 16 months [old], was in the back seat of the car during the robbery and shooting,' he added.

The baby was later turned over to the girl's relatives and the teenager remained in custody. Vivian is being held without bond in the Fulton County Jail.

The Fulton County district attorney's office yesterday released a statement saying that the 16-year-old girl would be charged as an adult.

'This case has been forwarded to our office for review,' it said. 'After consulting with the Sandy Springs Police Department, we have determined that the suspects in this matter should be prosecuted together. As such, we have decided to seek prosecution against the 16-year-old minor as an adult.'

Sgt. Momon said Vivian did not have an adult criminal record prior to the robbery and shooting and also said he did not know if Vivian was the father of the 16-month-old child.

Mr Zeitz, from Roswell, was known by the name 'Phobos' in online gaming circles. One of his online gaming teammates set up a Go Fund Me page to raise money for  funeral expenses. By Wednesday, the page had raised close to $17,000.

One person wrote: 'I am so sorry for your loss. I can't even begin to imagine what your family and friends are going through. Your sons [sic] life was worth a million times more than a PS4.'
