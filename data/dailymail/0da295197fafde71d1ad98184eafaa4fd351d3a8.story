A couple are celebrating the birth of their 17th baby.

Christi Cason, 42, and husband Dave, 46, welcomed their newest arrival, Vaughn, on Tuesday.

And despite having one of the biggest families in the United States, the proud parents have not ruled out having more.

Christi and Dave Cason gave birth to their 17th child, Vaughn, this week and did not rule out having another

Mrs Cason, who herself has 19 children, two from a previous relationship, has expressed a desire to have twins

Born at Rancho Springs Medical 
Center in Murrieta, California, Vaughn was the couple's second largest 
baby - born at 8lb 6oz.

Mr Cason said: 'Although I've been at Christi's side for 16 births I'm still blown away at welcoming new life into the world.

'It's an amazing experience - I cry every time.'

He added: 'The labour seemed to go really well but Christi is so experienced she makes it look easier than it is.'

The pair announced Mrs Cason's pregnancy earlier this year after being prescribed a fertility drug.

This followed 20 months of heartache for the couple in which they suffered two miscarriages.

Mrs Cason, who is a master at stretching her husband's $80,000 (£50,000) a year income, decided she wanted a 17th baby 
just five months after youngest Nathaniel, two, was born.

But sadly, despite falling pregnant within three months, Christi lost the baby just before her 12 week scan.

The couple tried again for a year 
without success, then, in September 2012, Mrs Cason's GP suggested she 
take Clomid, which stimulates the hormones necessary for ovulation.

Just
three months later, in November 2012, the couple were overjoyed when she 
fell pregnant. But tragically, just three days before Christmas, she 
miscarried again at nine weeks.

Although devastated, they were determined to try again, and now have Vaughn.

The couple, from Lake Elsinore, 
California, are already parents to Dalton, 20, Austin, 18, Bailey, 16, 
Gage, 15, Kaylee, 13, Harper, 12, Emma, 11, Rebekah, nine, Trevor, 
eight, Walker, seven, Morgan, six, Laura, five, Sawyer, three, and 
Nathaniel, two.

The mother also has two children, Jessica, 23, and Chad, 21, from a previous relationship.

The couple also celebrated becoming 
grandparents for the first time this year, after 
Jessica gave birth to baby Jaedyn, who Mrs Cason will be baby-sitting
for while Jessica is at work.

While expecting baby number 16, the Casons decorated their van with this message which says '100% home grown'

With so many children, the family eat up to 16 boxes of cereal and eight loaves of bread a week.

They also go through two gallons of milk a day and sit at an 11ft-long table.

Their weekly shop includes 14 gallons of milk, 8kg of hamburger meat, 7lb of chicken and three-dozen eggs - costing £250.

The couple have been forced to defend having so many children in the past.

Mrs Cason said: 'Dave earns $80,000 
(£50,000) a year and I'm good at managing the budget. One baby won't 
cost much more, we have most stuff.

'We do lots of fun things together as a family, like driving into the mountains singing songs on the way, or going to the beach.

'Even though we can't afford vacations, with a big family there are always so many other things you can do to have fun.

'Dave and I always make sure we have time for each child individually.'

Speaking at the time of falling pregnant with Vaughn, she said she'd still like twins.

'I think I've still got time for three more,' she said.

'Twenty kids would be an amazing achievement. I can't imagine a time when I stop changing nappies.'

Mrs Cason said it would be an 'amazing achievement' to have 20 children during her pregnancy with Vaughn (pictured)
