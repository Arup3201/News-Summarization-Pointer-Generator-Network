The missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 dropped to as low as 12,000ft in what could have been a cabin emergency before it disappeared from the radar, it has emerged.

As the exhaustive search continues in the Indian Ocean for the missing Boeing 777-200, an official revealed the doomed passenger jet made a sharp turn over the South China Sea which ‘seemed to be intentional’.

The plane's last confirmed position, picked up by Malaysian military radar, was at 2.15am Malaysia time (1815 GMT March 7) about 200 nautical miles north-west of Malaysia's Penang island, roughly an hour after it diverted from its scheduled route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

Radar tracking shows the aircraft changed altitude after making the ‘intentional’ sharp left turn as it headed toward the Strait of Malacca, a source close to the investigation said.

The anonymous official, who is not authorised to speak to the media, told CNN that flying at 12,000 feet in the heavily trafficked air corridor would’ve kept the missing jet out of sight of other aircraft.

Mary Schiavo, an aviation analyst and former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation, told the international broadcaster the new information was ‘highly significant’.

She said: ‘It explains so many pieces that didn't fit together before.

‘Now, if we have a scenario where something happened, the plane made a dramatic turn and dropped from 35,000 feet to 12,000 feet, this scenario would fit what a pilot would do in the event of a catastrophic on-board event, such as a rapid decompression, a fire, an explosion.

‘That's what you would have to do, descend, get down and turn around and try to get back to an airport that could accommodate an ailing plane.’

It raises questions over what might have happened in the plane’s cockpit to cause such a drop in altitude.

However, it is not yet clear how long it took the plane to descend to 12,000 feet, which officials will now be desperate to uncover.

Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss says the search operation is 'clutching' at new information after it was revealed new French satellite images were taken 850km from the current target zone

The new information comes after France said it was investigating a possible sighting of debris in the south Indian Ocean.

Officials are hoping the new data will help them solve the disappearance of the plane, which went missing with 239 people on board on March 8, and has quickly become one of the world's great aviation mysteries.

France's Foreign Ministry said yesterday that a satellite image taken 850 kilometres from the current search site in the Indian Ocean indicated floating debris in the water.

Satellite images previously issued by Australia and China have proved futile in the search so far with Chinese officials withdrawing their data last week after admitting to ‘mistakenly’ releasing it.

And search planes have so far failed to locate two objects that Australia said it had identified in the Indian Ocean, about 1,500 miles south east of Perth.

However, the new information from France has promoted authorities to widen the search area in the hunt for the doomed airliner.

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority's rescue coordination centre said the search area was expanded from 59,000 to 68,500 square kilometres (22,800-26,400 square miles) to include the new separate area uncovered by the French data.

It comes amid concerns of rain hampering the search, which has been buoyed by the addition of two Chinese Ilyushin IL-76 planes, increasing the number of aircraft involved from eight to 10.

There are also concerns about Tropical Cyclone Gillian bearing down on the Australian northwest coast which Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said ‘could stir up less favourable weather’.

The search could deteriorate rapidly this morning, with rain forecast in in the search area, about 2,500 kilometres (1,550 miles) southwest of Perth.

Officials will be worried about bad weather hindering the search, especially after Minister Truss described Sunday as a ‘fruitless day’ which delivered ‘nothing of note’.

He said: 'It is a very difficult task.

'The weather yesterday wasn't too bad, although there was early morning fog.

'Today we expect the weather to deteriorate and of course the forecasts ahead are not all that good.

'So it's going to be a challenge but we'll stick at it.'

He also described the search operation as 'clutching' at information, as flight and sea crews prepared to embark on their fifth day of sweeps in the target zone some 2,500km off the coast of Perth.

Acting Prime Minister of Australia Warren Truss speaks to the media at the RAAF Pearce Base, where he said the search for MH370 would continue 'while there's still hope' and until officials were certain it was 'futile'

'The French sighting is a piece of new material because that is in a completely different location.

That is about 850 kilometres north of our current search area,' Mr Truss told ABC Radio.

'That's not in the area that had been identified as the most likely place where the aircraft may have entered the sea. But having said all that we've got to check out all the options.

'We're just, I guess, clutching at whatever little piece of information comes along to try and find a place where we might be able to concentrate the efforts.'

Today's search, bolstered by 10 aircraft, including three civil planes, two Ilyushin IL-76 aircraft from China and two P3 Orions from Japan, has been split into two areas within the same proximity of the southern Indian Ocean covering 22,800sq miles.

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority said the aircraft will also search for possible objects in an area about 2,500 kilometres (1,550 miles) southwest of Perth.

Malaysian authorities have not ruled out any possible explanation for what happened to the jet, but have said the evidence so far suggests it was deliberately turned back across Malaysia to the Strait of Malacca, with its communications systems disabled.

They are unsure what happened next. Police are considering the possibilities of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board.
