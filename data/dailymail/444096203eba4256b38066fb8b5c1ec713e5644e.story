Police have launched an investigation after a video of a person doing burnouts around a small child standing in a playground  was posted online.

The footage shows the silver sedan speeding around a swing set, believed to be in Te Kuiti in New Zealand, as a dog runs dangerously close alongside the car and the young boy calls out.

At the end of the video a female voice can be heard saying 'That's enough'.

Video posted on Facebook shows a car silver sedan doing doughnuts around a playground in Te Kuiti, New Zealand while a young child stands in the middle and watches

The video was posted to Facebook but has since been taken down, the Waikato Times reported.

Local police were alerted to the footage, filmed at Mangaokewa Reserve, by the newspaper.

A New Zealand Police spokeswoman said an investigation was underway and police were talking to a number of people in relation to the video.

'At this stage it is too early to determine what course of action will be taken,' she told MailOnline.

'It is disappointing to see this type of behaviour occurring in any place but particularly in a public place which is frequently used by families with children.

'There is a high risk to the public and the driver as things can quite easily go wrong.'

Mangaokewa Reserve is a public park with play areas, picnic spots and a bush walking track. 

The footage, which has been taken down, also shows a dog running dangerously close to the car

Police are now trying to contact the driver and the person who posted the video online
