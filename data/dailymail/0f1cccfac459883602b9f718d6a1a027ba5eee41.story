Is your name Bob, Jim, Ron or Bill? If so, you're likely to be a man in demand after new research revealed that having a shortened name increases your appeal among the opposite sex.

Women who call themselves Jen, Val, Debs and Jo are also set to benefit as the effect is the same regardless of sex.

Overall, the new study found that shorter names had greater appeal than longer ones in a huge 72 per cent of cases.

Women did have a slight advantage though: while 79 per cent of men found shortened names appealing, the same was true for just 69 per cent of female respondents.

The study was conducted by online dating site Badoo, which studied the approaches made by its 190 million users and compared the number of emails sent to those who used shortened versions of their names to those who used their full names.

'Attractiveness online is not only about looks,' says a spokesperson for Badoo. 'Even the length of your name, it seems, may also make a surprising difference.'

'Your name says a huge amount about you,' says Jo Hemmings, a behavioural psychologist and dating coach.

'People with abbreviated names appear more approachable and friendlier; less intimidating. A diminutive name gives a sense of warmth and informality.”

In the UK, men with who used diminutives such as Mike, 
Matt, Phil or Chris attracted more female approaches per head than those
named Michael, Matthew, Philip or Christopher respectively.

Likewise, women called Sue, Mandy or Sam attracted more male advances than those named Susan, Amanda or Samantha.

The
general preference for short names, particularly for men, can also be 
seen in romantic novels whose square-jawed heroes typically have brief 
and often one-syllable names.   

In fact, the 
length of your name affects not only your allure but also your income as 
another recent study found.

Studies
of marriage records also show that your choice of husband or wife is 
influenced by the sound of their name.

'People are slightly more 
likely to marry people whose names sound like their own, even if the 
similarity is just sharing a first initial,' writes psychologist 
Jonathan Haidt in his book The Happiness Hypothesis.

So,
men named Dennis are more likely than others to marry women named 
Denise, while women named Louise are often drawn to men named Louis 
or even Laurence. 

Not only does your name reveal how popular you are with the opposite sex and how well you are paid, it can also give clues to how you're perceived by your friends.

A new study has found that men called Dave are seen to be the most loyal by friends and the same is true for women named Claire and Emma.

For advice, men are most likely to turn to friends named John but when life gets tough, it's friends named Steve, Dan or Peter that they most want to see.

Women, meanwhile, are likely to have known a friend called Sarah for the longest amount of time but will turn to friends named Becky, Joanne or Nicola when they need help.

The research, which was conducted by Jagermeister, also found that a fifth of British people see their best friends at least once a week, with one in three saying their best friends are more important to them than family members.

Dr Rebecca Spelman, a psychologist at the Private Therapy Clinic comments: 'The way in which names can influence someone’s personality is a self-fulfilling prophecy and without recognising it, we build a mental image and certain expectations of what a person is like based on their name.

'Meeting another 'Dave' will lead to a subconscious consideration about the original acquaintance, that in turn, helps hone the belief that he, too possesses similar qualities.

'Interestingly many parents name their children after a person they particularly like.  Some names happen to be more successful than others and some sound more attractive.

'So it seems that the names that have the best influence on people’s lives keep getting reused again and again.'
