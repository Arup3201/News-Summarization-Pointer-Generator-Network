It has long been assumed that J. Crew Factory simply sells old, unwanted stock at a heavily discounted price. But these 'deals' might not be what they seem.

Rather, the outlet store is actually selling knock-offs of its own products, creating a separate line of lower-quality goods that look similar to what can be found in the main retail store.

According to Buzzfeed, most outlet items from J. Crew, Gap and even Off 5th are simply 'based on (full-price) products sold in previous seasons'.

Spot the difference: J. Crew's linen Carrie Dot 
dress from last summer, $148 (left) is available online at J. Crew 
Factory for $104.50 (right), however the outlet dress is made from cotton and 
features a mismatched seam

Saks Fifth Avenue factory store, Off 5th, even admitted to investors last year that only 10per cent of the outlet merchandise is leftover Saks inventory.

With 25per cent of the factory stock made up of private-label goods from brands like Rag and Bone and Alice + Olivia, the rest, 65per cent, is actually merchandise created specifically for Off 5th by 'brand-appropriate' vendors.

Nordstrom Rack, the department store's popular discount store, does this too.

The company notes in a press release: 'The Rack carries merchandise from Nordstrom stores and Nordstrom.com, as well as specially-purchased items from many of the top brands sold at Nordstrom.'

Close match: J. Crew's Darby striped loafers, $168 (left) feature leather soles and are made in Italy; the J. Crew Factory version, $74.50 (right) features a man-made sole with slight style differences

Flower power: Last summer's Punk Floral Print scoop dress, made from silk dupioni, retailed at J. Crew for $178 (left); the near identical dress is selling at J. Crew Factory for $74.50, but it is made from polyester

To an untrained eye, J. Crew Factory's version looks like it is the same dress, just two seasons old. But in fact, the near identical dress, selling for $74.50, is made from polyester.

Items sold at the J. Crew Factory, both online and in store, will often use the same prints as full-priced items, but the fabric can be markedly different.

Take for example, last summer's Punk Floral Print scoop dress, which was made from silk dupioni and retailed at J. Crew for $178.

To an untrained eye, J. Crew Factory's version looks like it is the same dress, just two seasons old. But in fact, the near identical dress, selling for $74.50, is made from polyester.

Similarly, J. Crew's well-known linen Carrie Dot dress from last summer ($148) is also available online at J. Crew Factory. However, the outlet dress ($104.50) is made from cotton, and unlike the full-priced version, a mismatched seam can be found at the back.

LearnVest noted that retailers recognize the profitability of attracting people who are looking for a deal, so they are building an industry around outlet shopping that is completely separate from their regular business

These 'potentially misleading marketing practices by outlet stores' are now being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission after four members of Congress looked at 'the difficulty in identifying made-for-outlet goods' and the 'deceptive reference pricing.'

And J. Crew isn't alone. Bebe told investors that it sustains its outlets with 65per cent made-for-outlet merchandise, while American Eagle has said it anticipates carrying 75per cent made-for-factory items starting this year.

Under Armour said in September that its outlets carry 75per cent made-for-outlet goods, while Coach and high-end luggage maker Tumi have said 85per cent of their outlet goods are made-for-factory.

LearnVest noted in 2011 that as retailers have begun to recognize the profitability of attracting Americans -- and even tourists -- who are looking for a deal, they are now building an industry around outlet shopping that is completely separate from their regular business.

Saks Fifth Avenue factory store, Off 5th, admitted to investors last year that only 10per cent of the outlet merchandise is leftover Saks inventory

An outlet buyer for a luxury department store in New York, who wished to remain anonymous, explained: 'I would guess that only about 10-15per cent of our outletâ€™s stock was actually items that the main store carried. The rest of it was merchandise we bought or produced for the outlets.'

While there are sometimes ways to tell whether the merchandise came from a full-price store or whether it's a cheaper version of the real thing -- J.Crew Factory puts two some dots on its tags and the Gap outlet marks its products with three dots -- customers continue to feel duped.

'I personally am unhappy with the way J. Crew is handling their outlet merchandise,' said one commenter named Courtney on the blog J. Crew Aficionada. 'Don't get me started on the outlet t-shirts that look very similar to the perfect fit t's, but they tend to lose their shape and pill.'

She continued: 'I was at the outlet last weekend and I decided to try on a pair of cropped black "mini pants" and as a put my leg into the pantleg it split from inseam to knee. (The size I tried on is one larger then I usually wear in the retail store -- it's all they had). This wasn't an error of size, but quality.'
