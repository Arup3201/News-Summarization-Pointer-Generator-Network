A 23-year-old Virginia woman was struck and killed by a valet-driven vehicle - two days before she celebrated her second wedding anniversary.

Josephine Stone, an aspiring journalist, was struck on Friday night by a vehicle being driven to the Hilton Garden Inn garage in downtown Richmond by a parking attendant, police say.

Charges are pending against the driver.

Tragic: Josephine Stone, 23, was struck and killed by a valet car on Friday - two days before celebrating her second wedding anniversary

The Richmond-Times Dispatch reports 
Mrs Stone was walking along North Fifth Street from 
Penny Lane Pub at approximately 10pm, when she stopped to greet friends and former 
co-workers.

Reports suggest she was heading to a show at The National on East Broad 
Street. She had reportedly planned to return to the local pub after the concert, and had left some of her possessions behind.

Police said the matter had been referred to the Richmond Commonwealth's Attorney's Office for review.

Further details regarding the incident had not been released at press time.

The woman's husband, John Stone,  told WTVR.com he spent the weekend planning a 
memorial in her honour, instead of the couple's anniversary 
celebration.

'We had a little ceremony at the end of the Halloween parade and got married,' he said, recalling their wedding.

'She's the love of my life. I don't know what I am going to do without her.'

He told the website they met working 
at the Penny Lane Pub. After graduating cum laude from Virginia 
Commonwealth University last spring with degrees in journalism and 
English, she left to start work as a technical writer for health 
benefits company Wellpoint.

Mr Stone said most recently the couple had started an online magazine together.

A memorial service was held in her 
honour on Monday afternoon at Bon Air Baptist Church in Chesterfield, 
led by Chaplain Rich Underhill, a family friend.

There, some of the two hundred people who gathered to pay tribute, spoke 
of her memory, reports the Richmond-Times Dispatch.

Some cited her 'incredible sense of humour', her 'infectious laugh', and spoke of the 'great future' that lied ahead for her.

David Taborelli, Mrs Stone's uncle and 
godfather, recalled her childhood. 'She was smiling and happy from day one,' he said.

'She became a successful woman. To have so much
success at such an early age is mind-blowing to me. She lived up to her
potential.'
