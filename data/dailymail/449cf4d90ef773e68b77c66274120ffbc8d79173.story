A 72-year-old woman got a shocker Sunday when her Dell laptop exploded on her while sitting at her desk .

Loretta Luff of Langhorne Manor, Pennsylvania says she was in the middle washing of loads of laundry when she sat down at her living room desk to check emails and play spider solitaire on the 6-year-old laptop, a gift from her daughter.

Unexpectedly, the laptop blew backwards and send battery acid flying as far as six to eight feet away.

'The next thing I knew, my shirt was on fire, I grabbed that and took that off and I think that's when I singed my hair,' Mrs Luff told CBS Philly.

Shock: Loretta Luff of Langhorne Manor, Pennsylvania was using her computer Sunday when it unexpectedly exploded and sprayed battery acid across her living room. Mrs Luff was taken to the hospital and treated for first- and second-degree chemical burns

Power: Langhorne-Middletown Fire Company Chief Frank Farry says it appears the six-year-old computer's battery pack exploded and caused the fire. On the right, burn spots are visible on the floor near Mrs Luff's living room desk

When she got up, Mrs Luff stepped on a mini fire that started, burning her foot.

Mrs Luff was able to douse the patches of flames erupting all over the carpet with water from her toy poodles' dog bowl, and responding firefighters put out the rest of the hot spots. 

Mrs Luff was taken to the hospital where she was treated for first- and second-degree chemical burns to her face, arm and foot. She was released later that night.

Langhorne- Middletown Fire Company Chief Frank Farry says he's been fighiting fires for 25 years and has never seen anything like a computer explode. He says it appears the battery back inside the computer went off like a bomb, but that it's too early to know for sure what caused the fire.

Chief Farry also said the neighborhood suffered a power outage earlier in the day and that the laptop was plugged into an extension cord at the time.

Faulty battery? Mrs Luff holds up what remains 
of her computer's battery. Dells says laptop owners can increase the 
chance of fire if they replace batteries from a third-party company. Mrs
 Luff says she replaced the battery three years ago, but is not sure 
where it came from

Incendiary: The battery acid sprayed onto Mrs Luff's cotton tank-top, and lit it on fire

Dell has issued a statement saying they are investigating the incident, but that lithium-ion batteries rarely explode.

'It's also important to note that, in our product documentation, Dell tells customers that “using an incompatible battery or a third-party battery may increase the risk of fire or explosion and that they should replace the battery only with a battery purchased from Dell that is designed to work with their Dell computer.”'

Mrs Luff admits she replaced the computer's battery about three years ago, but isn't sure if it came from the company.

She says she's just glad she was at home when the computer exploded, as she fears it could have burned the house down if it weren't for her quick action.

When she gets a new computer, she's going to be taking the battery out every night.

'I would never take the chance of happening a second time because I was lucky this time,' she said.
