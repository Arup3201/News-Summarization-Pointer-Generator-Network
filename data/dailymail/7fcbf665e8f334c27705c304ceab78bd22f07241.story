A financial adviser was recorded on an answer machine strangling his university girlfriend after a 12-hour row by text message was jailed for more than seven years today.

Carmen Miron Buchacra, 28 - known as Gaby - can be heard begging for her life on a voicemail recording as her partner  Paul Keene, 32, strangled her and repeatedly punched her in the face.

The fatal attack came after the pair had sent bitter and angry text messages to each other when Keene was out drinking and Ms Buchacra was caring for their baby.

She accused him on not wanting to spend time with their child and threatened to take their daughter, then 11-weeks-old, away from him.

Carmen Miron-Buchacra's last words and cries for help were recorded as she was strangled and punched in the face by her partner Paul Keene

The terrified mother called a friend when Keene arrived at their home following his all-day drinking binge at a boules match.

But her friend was out of signal and the phone went straight to voicemail - recording for eight minutes and 29 seconds as Keene killed Gaby with an electrical flex.

Gaby, an 'outstanding and gifted' PhD student in postgenomic biosciences at Bath University's Department of Biochemistry, can be heard pleading with Keene as their 11-week-old baby lay in a cot nearby.

The voicemail recorded Keene repeatedly punching Gaby in the face and strangling her before she gasps 'please don't' - and falls silent.

Keene was arrested after police discovered Gaby's body at the couple's flat in Bath, Somerset.

He was acquitted of murder after a trial at Bristol Crown Court last December but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of loss of control.

Keene wiped tears from his eyes yesterday as he was jailed for seven years and four months at Bristol Magistrates Court.

Mr Justice Eder told him: 'You hit Gaby and after a sustained, prolonged and savage attack you eventually killed her.

'It was probably caused by you strangling her with an electric cable around the neck.

'It was a vicious attack that lasted several minutes, we know this because she had many injuries on her face, arms, body and legs and there was blood spattered on one of the drawers.

'But also it was recorded on a friend's voicemail.

'I accept what caused you to lose self control was the cumulative effect of emotional abuse by Gaby over a significant period.

'In particular the threat to take away your daughter that you loved and that you would not be a part of their lives.

'The sentence can and should be imposed to reflect the horrifying circumstances which you inflicted on Gabby.'

Gaby had called friend Ben Jones for help when Keene arrived at their home following a work game of boules with investment firm Advance Investments.

Keene turned up at the flat and Gaby was forced to let him in, where he shouted at her and launched his fatal attack

But Ben was on a train and out of signal - meaning Gaby's last moments and the horrific killing was recorded on his answerphone.

Mother-of-one Gaby can be heard pleading for her life as Keene punches her, telling her to shut up or 'you will be dead'.

He can be heard snarling: 'Why are you crying?

'What the f*** is your problem? What have I done to you today? Carry on like this and I'm going to end up in prison because you will be dead.

'I may kill you because you are a f****** t***.'

During the trial Michael Fitton, QC, prosecuting, told how Keene first tried to strangle Gaby using a dressing gown cord before switching to an electrical cable to ensure her death.

He told the jury: 'Her last words were, 'please don't', then silence.

'When he took hold of the dressing gown cord and wrapped it around her neck he was clearly trying to kill her.

'When he failed in that attempt and reached for the electrical cable he was showing a persistence to kill her that is at odds with his defence.'

He said the couple, who were engaged, had exchanged a 12-hour long series of angry text messages on the day of Gaby's death, June 23 this year.

Keene, who gave evidence at his trial, told the jury he lost control and could not remember what happened when he killed Gaby at their home

Gaby accused Keene of not wanting to spend time with her and their baby daughter, Eleanor, and told him not to return home.

But Keene turned up at the flat and Gaby was forced to let him in, calling friend Ben for help - but he lost signal during the call as he was travelling on the train.

Gaby tried to call again but was diverted to Ben's voicemail, leaving the phone recording as Keene launched his fatal attack.

It is believed that Gaby died during the phone call, which began at 10.46pm.

Adam Vaitilingam, QC, defending, said: 'This was a relationship in which there was psychological bullying.

'There was plainly an in balance which resulted in Mr Keene being belittled by the deceased.

'The nature of the psychological bullying was very much on and off.

'He was walking on egg shells a lot of the time, things would be terrific and then they would go badly wrong.

'He would be, as it were, ostracised for significant periods. This was a period of low level emotional abuse.

'It went on for a considerable period of time, which culminated in the threat to take a child.'

Keene, who gave evidence at his trial, told the jury he lost control and could not remember what happened when he killed Gaby, from Mexico.

He also claimed he had no recollection of what happened in the hour and ten minutes between killing Gaby and calling 999.

The financial advisor told officers he had drunk nine bottles of ale, a bottle of cider and a glass of rose wine during the boules tournament.

Her family described the 'indescribable ache' in their hearts.

Their statement said: 'Gaby was a beautiful person, inside and out. She spread love, peace and laughter amongst those who were lucky to have met her.

'Her departure has left an indescribable ache in our hearts; an ache that only her baby girl has been able to alleviate over the past few months.

'Gaby's life was full of dreams, hopes and professional and personal accomplishments, where becoming a mother was the biggest of them all, her life was abruptly and unjustly taken.

'Her death has caused amongst all of our family great sorrow and pain, she was an extraordinary daughter, a wonderful sister, a thoughtful friend, but most of all, she was an outstanding mother.

'Our family has had to deal with the fact that nothing will bring us back our beloved Gaby.

'It is up to us now, however, to keep her always close to our hearts and always in our minds.'

They added: '"The actions of one person have affected the lives of the ones who loved and cared for Gaby unconditionally.

'Nobody has the right to take someone's life, especially when there is an innocent baby in the line who has now been left without her mother who welcomed her into the world with so much love and so much expectation.

'Gaby's intentions were always to better herself professionally and personally, to have a family and to provide for her daughter.

'All that we have left is to remember her with love and tenderness but most of all, to provide her biggest treasure, Ellie Mae, with the love and care that Gaby would have wanted for her.'
