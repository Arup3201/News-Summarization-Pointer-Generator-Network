Expelled: Jordan Ford was accused of abusing a teacher online after he was told off for dying his hair

When he was suspended after turning up for school with a dyed red mohican hairstyle, Jordan Ford decided to take revenge.

The 14-year-old searched his head teacher’s Facebook page and found an old picture of her with her hair dyed a bright colour.

Jordan then posted the photograph, showing Keziah Featherstone dressed flamboyantly to promote World Book Day, on Facebook.

Underneath the image of Miss Featherstone in a yellow and green dress, fluorescent pink Dr Martens boots, purple hair and wearing fake tattoos, he wrote: ‘This is not an example to set to other students.’

The posting attracted 50 comments, many of them abusive, and as a result Jordan was expelled from Bridge Learning Campus in Whitchurch, Bristol. The academy school said he had been excluded permanently for inciting abuse on Facebook and failing to apologise.

It claims Jordan posted a number of derogatory comments about Miss Featherstone’s looks and weight. The school’s chief executive Mark Davies said the post encouraged other students to cyber bully a member of staff.

But Jordan’s parents Patricia Hedges, 43, and John Ford, 46, defended their son. Mr Ford said: ‘My wife went up to the school to see if there was any chance of him going back but because he is a bit of a clown they were looking for an excuse to get rid of him.

‘We think it’s unfair. He dyed his hair red and the school made a really big thing of it but there are teachers up there with coloured hair.

‘You can’t even go to the council [to appeal against the expulsion] because the school is an academy.’

Mrs Hedges, a mother of four, said of the posting of Miss Featherstone’s picture by her son: ‘If she doesn’t want this, she should have private settings.

‘The other children commenting said much worse stuff but Jordan is the only one punished. He’s no angel but I just want him back in education.’

Jordan was first told off about his hair shortly before half-term in October, when he turned up with the red mohican.

The Year Nine student was told that he needed to alter the style before returning to school after the week-long break.

But because his hair was still auburn, he was suspended from class for three days. It was then he took to Facebook to express his anger, using the picture of Miss Featherstone in fancy dress to promote reading. It is believed the photograph was taken before she joined Bridge.

After teachers discovered the post, Jordan was temporarily excluded before Christmas.

He was permanently excluded on January 5 and sent to another school but is now completing his studies from home.

Jordan has since apologised for the Facebook post and said that he wishes to return to Bridge. He said: ‘I regret doing it. I have apologised. I shook Mr Davies’ hand and said I was sorry.’

Mr Davies said: ‘His actions were against the morals of the school. It invaded a person’s private space and he copied pictures from a staff member’s personal Facebook profile.’

Mr Davies said Jordan had refused to take part in meetings with Miss Featherstone over the postings, which were now being investigated by police as ‘malicious communications’.
