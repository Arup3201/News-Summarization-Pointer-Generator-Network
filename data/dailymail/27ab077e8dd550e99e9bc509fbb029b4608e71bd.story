A California woman has been charged with ‘theft by false pretenses’ after she allegedly tricked people into giving her money and gifts by falsely claiming she had breast cancer.

Cristina Lagman, 39, of Homeland used Facebook to string along hundreds of 'friends' and well-wishers with regular updates on her struggle along with photos of herself with no hair and wearing breast cancer awareness T-shirts.

'I am so scared … I have fought really hard … I don’t think I really believed it might really take me till today,” Lagman wrote on February 2.

'I’m down to possibly just weeks … my children and parents are in their own worlds and I’m left with the burden of dying by myself,' read another post.

Kindhearted supporters established a GoFundMe page and even organized a fund-raising event on her behalf at the Aces Comedy Club in Murrieta. 

It was after the fundraiser that some people started to become suspicious about Lagman's condition. 

'Cristina was happy, frolicking around, drinking quite a bit, passing donation bags around, and I thought her behavior was odd since she had said she only had four to six weeks of life left,' said Valerie Cortes, who'd previously been one of her strongest supporters. 

Lagman raised suspicions when she took a cross country road trip rather than spending time with her kids

Rather than using the money raised to help prepare her teenage children for a life without their mother, Lagman took a cross-country road trip and asked for gift cards for restaurants and spa treatments.

'She was going drinking every night and partying like a rock star,' Cortes, who had personally donated about $250 in cash and gift cards, told ABC10.

Cortes also noticed that a photo that purported to show Lagman receiving chemotherapy was actually a stock photograph posted widely online. 

'One of the things she said to all of us was that she was in stage 5 and stage 5 doesn't exist,' said Cortes.

With suspicions growing, Cortes confronted Lagman for proof of her illness and she was promptly 'unfriended'. 

‘People started hitting her up on Facebook and asking her to prove that she really had cancer, and as they did that she would start deleting them on Facebook,’ comedy club owner Rocky Osborne told KTLA.

Cortes reported Lagman - who remains very much alive and well - to Murrieta police who charged her on October 21.

It is estimated that she received around $3,000 in donations and gifts from duped givers, court records show. 

Lagman has denied the allegations and maintains that she does have cancer – although she is now doing better. 

'That’s how cancer is,' she said. 'Every day people are told they’re not going to make it and miracles happen. 

'I’ve done nothing, nothing illegal whatsoever.'

Lagman is due in court for arraignment on December 2. She is already on probation for a 2013 embezzlement conviction and was also convicted of welfare fraud in 2012.
