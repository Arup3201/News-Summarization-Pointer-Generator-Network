President Obama sat down to talks with Ukraine's Petro Poroshenko in the White House Thursday, making a pledge to continue mobilizing the international community to reach a diplomatic solution to the crisis in Ukraine.

Obama, however, stopped short of offering his Eastern European counterpart lethal military aid he had been asking for.  

President Poroshenko, who met with Obama in the Oval Office, said he hoped the ceasefire in his country would lead to a broader peace.

He told reporters later that he was satisfied with the assistance that Washington was providing to Ukraine.

Pleased: Poroshenko later told reporters he was satisfied with the outcome of his meeting with the president 

The two world leaders met in the Oval Office, sitting side by side in an apparent show of support for the Ukraine against Moscow.

Obama praised Poroshenko's leadership, describing it as 'critical, at a very, very important time in Ukraine's history.'

‘Unfortunately, what we have also seen is Russian aggression, first in Crimea and most recently in portions of eastern Ukraine,’ he added.

Mr Obama also hit out at Russia for violating Ukraine's sovereignty and accused Vladimir Putin's government of trying to undermine Poroshenko's reforms, reported AFP via Yahoo News. 

At the conclusion of the bilateral talks, Mr Poroshenko spoke to reporters outside the West Wing but would not say whether he had asked Obama to send the Ukrainian forces weapons to fight against insurgents.

'I asked the president to increase the cooperation in security and defense and I received a positive answer,' he said.

Earlier in the day, Poroshenko  appealed to the U.S. Congress for a broad spectrum of military aid, more sanctions and a special security
status.

Poroshenko was on a visit to Washington DC to bolster US support for his strategy in handling Russian-backed separatists.

'I strongly encourage the United States to give Ukraine a
special security and defense status which reflects the highest
level of interaction with non-NATO allies,' Poroshenko said in
an emotional speech to the House of Representatives and Senate. 

He was interrupted frequently by applause and standing ovations.

Poroshenko asked for more aid for Ukraine's military, going
beyond equipment such as night-vision goggles that Washington
has already sent.

'They need more political support throughout the world. They
need more military equipment, both lethal and non-lethal,' he
said.

'Blankets, night-vision goggles are also important, but one
cannot win the war with blankets,' he said.

Poroshenko also pushed for more sanctions against Russia for
its seizure of Crimea from Ukraine and backing of the separatist
movement.

'I also asked that the United States be forceful and reflect
its principles with the respect of further sanctions against the
aggressor,' Poroshenko said.

As Poroshenko visited the U.S. Capitol, President Barack
Obama's administration pledged $53 million in fresh aid to
Ukraine for its struggle against Russia's incursion, including
counter-mortar radar equipment.
