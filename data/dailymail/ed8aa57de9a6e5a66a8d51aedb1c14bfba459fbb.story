The British mother involved in a £1.6million cocaine smuggling plot is back home after spending a year behind bars in a Bali jail.

While her co-conspirator, grandmother Lindsay Sandiford, has been left languishing on death row, Rachel Dougall has been reunited with her daughter, Kitty, 7, who has no idea why she vanished for so long.

Dougall has been freed after serving a year in the squalid Kerobokan Prison.

Speaking yesterday as she left her mother’s flat in Brighton for a break with Kitty, she said her daughter’s welfare was her priority.

She was later seen drinking beers with friends on a yacht on Brighton Marina.

Speaking outside her home, Dougall said: 
‘I want to spend a week or so with my daughter before I think about 
saying anything about what happened to me in Bali.

‘Naturally I want to keep Kitty out of this. She is the most important person to me.’

At one stage Rachel Dougall feared she 
would face the firing squad after Sandiford accused her of being part of
a British ‘gang of four’ involved in a major drug smuggling racket.

In contrast to the welcome home balloons that greeted Dougall, Sandiford is still in Kerobokan while her lawyers work on the final appeals against her death penalty.

She was one of four Britons arrested last May over a 10.6lb stash of cocaine brought from Bangkok.

Dougall, pictured with Ponder after their arrest, has previously said she feared she would be executed for drugs offences but instead received only a 12-month sentence for failing to report a crime

All four initially faced possible death sentences for trafficking.

But while Sandiford, 56, who gave evidence against her co-conspirators after being arrested at Bali airport was put on death row, Dougall got just one year for failing to report a crime.

Dougall lived in Bali in a luxury three-bedroom villa with a large swimming pool and marble floors that she shared with her daughter and partner Julian Ponder, 44.

British antique dealer Ponder - the syndicate's alleged ringleader - got six years for possession of 23g cocaine that was found in the villa but was cleared of smuggling. 

Paul Beales, 41, was sentenced to four years for possession.

Dougall’s release came as a former fellow inmate claimed that Ponder arranged huge bribes to get himself, Dougall, Beales and Indian national Nanda Gopal off trafficking charges.

Sandiford was sentenced to death for drug smuggling but prosecutors have appealed against the death penalty

The former inmate claims it was confirmed to him in a conversation in Kerobokan that sums averaging ‘around $350,000 (£231,000) each’ had been paid to have the trafficking charges against the four reduced.

No money was apparently paid on behalf of Sandiford, whose death sentence is being challenged in a final appeal before the Supreme Court in Jakarta.

Speaking to The Mail on Sunday on condition of anonymity, the former inmate offering to testify on Sandiford’s behalf said he had come forward because he felt she had been treated unjustly.

In an unusual step, prosecutors – who asked for a 15-year jail term for Sandiford at her trial – have also appealed against the death penalty.

A decision on the appeal is expected in the next two months. 

Sandiford sits next to packets of drugs found in her suitcase. An inmate has claimed that Ponder arranged a large bribe to ensure reduced sentences for himself and Dougall but no bribe was paid for Sandiford who is facing execution
