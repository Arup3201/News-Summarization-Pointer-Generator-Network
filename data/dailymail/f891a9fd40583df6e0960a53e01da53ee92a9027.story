A renowned microsculptor has crafted what may be the world's smallest ever piece of art - inside a hollowed-out strand of hair.

Willard Wigan created his tiniest work to date using a microscopic flake of gold from a chain and a speck of his own stubble.

The steady-handed artist brushed his face after a shave before working on the dot of hair which had become embedded in his fingerprint.

Willard Wigan created his tiniest work to date using a microscopic flake of gold from a chain and a speck of his own stubble

The Orange County chopper - which measures just 3 microns - is smaller than a human blood cell and only visible through a microscope

The 55-year-old then painstakingly hollowed out the stubble before shaping a detailed chopper motorbike inside it by working in between heartbeats.

Using microscopic fragments of diamond which he adapted into a tool, Mr Wigan spent 16 hours a day over a five-week period producing the remarkable piece at his studio in Birmingham.

It is so small that even the pulse in his finger could have crushed the sculpture altogether.

The incredible artist - who saw his achievements honoured by the Queen in 2007, with an MBE - has been baffling scientists with his intricate work for more than 10 years.

But he says his latest piece has surprised even himself.

He said today: 'Creating the smallest sculptures in the world wasn't enough for me. I wanted to push myself to another level - and go even smaller.

'This is the tiniest thing I have ever done and by far the most complicated. The bike is made up of about 12 individual specks of gold.

'I wanted to go beyond human expectations - but I wanted to personally challenge myself.

'It drove me mad to do. I burst a blood vessel in my eye staring so hard through the microscope,' said Mr Wigan

'I dabbed my finger on my chin after shaving and took the tiniest piece of stubble in between my fingerprint.

'It drove me mad to do - I burst a blood vessel in my eye staring so hard through the microscope.

'It has been one of my most challenging projects ever. I have surpassed what I even thought I was capable of.

'I see the hair as a little road - and I've always loved those Orange County choppers.

'But not even a dust-mite could ride this bike.'

Mr Wigan - who shot to fame with his tiny pinhead sculptures including the Incredible Hulk and the Obamas - will be exhibiting his latest work throughout Europe, China and the U.S. throughout the year.

He added: 'My mother always told me the smaller you go - the bigger your name would be.

'She kept pushing me - so I pushed myself.

'A lot of people are aware of my work but they would never have seen anything like this before.'
