Families are typically £728 a year worse off than 12 months ago, a study showed yesterday.

The decline – more severe than during the 2008 recession – comes amid warnings that the cost of living squeeze is about to get worse.

The monthly Asda Income Tracker claims ‘families have never had it so tough’ with a 7.9 per cent fall in average household discretionary spending.

This means that after covering must-pay bills for food, heat, light, and the mortgage or rent, the average family is left with just £162 a week for everything else.

The figures are a further blow to claims that the economy is in recovery and come at the same time as British supermarkets launch a vicious price war to capture customers' diminishing spending

Asda's Income Tracker found that the average family now has £162 disposable income per week, a 7.9 per cent fall since last year

For someone on average earnings, the £14 a week fall equates to a pay cut of around £1,000 a year.

The figures are the worst in the 
four-year history of the study, while the current cost of living squeeze
is said to be the longest and deepest for at least 60 years.

Two other studies confirm the 
situation has profound consequences for families and the wider economy.

The Prudential found one third of those with a company pension scheme 
have stopped making contributions because they cannot afford them, so 
threatening poverty in old age.

Price cuts: Tesco has slashed 3,000 prices to appeal to cash-strapped consumers

And the CBI said high street sales are down on this time last year, which could push some retailers over the edge.

The Asda study found nine in ten of 
us say things are tougher now than they were this time last year. 
Customers say utilities and fuel costs are the biggest pressure on 
income.

The official CPI measure of inflation
rose from 4.4 per cent in July to 4.5 per cent in August. These 
increases are way ahead of an average 2 per cent rise in incomes and 
pensions in the past year, which means Britons are getting poorer by the
week.

Asda offered some relief to consumers
by announcing a 2p a litre cut in the price of petrol and diesel. It 
was immediately followed by Tesco and Morrisons.

Sainsbury’s said it was cutting fuel prices at many stores by ‘up to’ 2p per litre.

Asda’s fuel price cut means there 
will be a national price cap across all its 188 petrol stations of 
130.7p a litre for unleaded and 135.7 for diesel.

The income tracker is compiled in 
partnership with the Centre for Economics and Business Research, whose 
managing economist, Charles Davis, warned there may be worse to come. 
‘Rising unemployment has added further pressure to household finances in
recent months, compounding the squeeze on spending power caused by high
inflation and weak earnings growth,’ he said.

‘Family spending power has fallen 
sharply compared with a year ago. With the UK economy in a particularly 
precarious state at the moment, things could get worse before they get 
better.’

Asda asked customers what the 
Government should do to help people. Four in five said action to put 
money into people’s pockets should be top of the agenda. Two in five 
wanted a freeze on energy bills and a quarter wanted a cut in fuel duty.
