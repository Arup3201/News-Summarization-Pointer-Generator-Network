When Sonya Gore's estranged husband asked her on Facebook if they could get back together, she set him a challenge that doubled as punishment.

She forced Ivan Lewis to post a photo of himself on the social media site holding a hand-written note that read, 'I cheated on my wife!!! (and she was ugly!!!)'.

But proving that hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, the 40-year-old said she would only get back with Lewis if his embarrassing September 22 post attracted 10,000 likes.

Revenge: Sonya Gore, left, said she pushed Ivan Lewis, right, to post the note because she wanted him to feel the same humiliation he put her through due to his cheating

The post already has more than 8,000 likes, although Gore said she is 'not making the decision [to reconcile] solely on that.'

The couple reportedly separated just 10 months after marrying in February 2010 due to Lewis' serial cheating.

But Lewis recently asked Gore on Facebook if she would 'marry him again', prompting Gore to propose the online apology.

'I 
wrote the post out myself,' Gore told News One. 'Before he posted the post up, he 
asked me to marry him again on Facebook and I’m like ‘Well, if you want 
to put that on Facebook then you need to say that you cheated and put 
that on Facebook.' '

Gore said she was with Lewis at his computer when he posted the 
admission, and wanted him to feel the same 
humiliation she felt as a result of his cheating. 

'If he loves me, he loves me,' she said.

Motivation: This is the Facebook post that inspired jilted wife Sonya Gore to force her estranged husband Ivan Lewis to declare his cheating ways

Gore told NewsOne that she wanted to divorce Lewis and even sought legal advice on the decision, but she had a change of heart following her straying hubby's online declarations.

However, the online response to the public shaming has been divided.

Lewis' supporters congratulated him for 'manning up', including one that said: 'I don't know you but I salute you for being a man and admitting to your mistake and being willing to that the embarrassment to prove to your lady that you're willing to go the extra mile.'

Even Gore jumped in to defend her man, writing: 'It takes a man to do what he has done he gotta here all the jokes from his so called friends an family an he set that a side to prove his love for me what girl would not want that?'

However many criticized and ridiculed the couple's 'attention-seeking' behavior and warned that Lewis probably hasn't changed.
