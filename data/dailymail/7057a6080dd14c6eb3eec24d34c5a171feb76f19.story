The senior vice-president of a legal insurance company is suing Google over her corporate photo and mocking comments that were published on a satirical website.

SexyExecs.blogspot.com is a Google-hosted blog that takes company headshots of business executives and adds humorous, sometimes offensive, commentary. 

Ann Dieleman, Chief Marketing and Business Development Officer at ARAG North America, filed a lawsuit against Google last week over the photo that they say the internet giant has refused to take down.

Unfair: Ann Dieleman and her company, have filed a copyright suit over this post on a blog hosted by Google

Dieleman's picture appeared on the site in December 2009, with critical comments about her appearance and gums.

The posting added: 'Sadly, Ann doesnt hold up to the sort of advanced, high levels of scrutiny people are subjected to these days.

It's not us doing this, it's celebrity-obsessed media culture. Blame Heat magazine.'

Challenge: Ann Dieleman says she is asserting her legal rights and Google have refused to remove the offending picture

ARAG, based in Des Moines, and Dieleman say they have tried and failed to get Google to take down the picture - so they took out a copyright suit against the company on December 31, 2013.

'We've followed the appropriate procedures to remove the content.

'However, after continued back and forth it was time to assert my legal rights,' Dieleman said, reported by the Des Moines Register.

'Given I've spent the majority of my 
career educating and empowering people to protect their rights, I didn't
 feel it would be right to ignore protection of my own when this 
situation arose,' she continued.

Dieleman and her company, both named in last week's suit, claim that the site invited unfavorable comments on the picture.

They say they informed Google in September 2012 that SexyExecs' use of the corporate photo infringed their copyright.

According to the court documents, Google responded later that month saying they had decided not to remove the content.

'As always, we encourage you to resolve any disputes directly with the 
blogger in question,' Google emailed back, as stated in the suit.

But Dieleman and ARAG have continued with legal proceedings.

Target: Kevin Cooney, Corporate Vice President & Chief Information Officer at Xilinx, also gets the treatment. Underneath his photo it reads: False teeth? Eyes look suspicious as well. And no way are those actual ears.'

'Sometimes life takes us by surprise and impacts us professionally and personally,' she said in a statement.

'This
 reinforces why I'm so committed to ARAG's mission of enabling every 
citizen – not just those who can afford it – to assert their legal 
rights.'

SexyExecs has not been updated since May 2011, but Dieleman is not the only executive who might feel aggrieved by the site.

A picture of Rick Hamada, president of Avnet, has the comment: 'If you're going to do a combover, Rick, you need to start combing from further down.'
