The 10-year-old girl whose body was found stuffed in a trash can had been starved to death by her parents, it was revealed today.

The victim, Emani Moss, was found on Saturday after her guilt-ridden father called 911 and said he was about to commit suicide.

At the time, Eman Moss told officers that his daughter swallowed poison and he and his wife dumped the girl's body in the garbage and tried burning it in panic.

Now police have concluded that the 10-year-old had not been given anything to eat for more than a week before her death.

The
Atlanta Journal Constitution reports that the arrest warrant affidavit 
says that the girl's father an stepmother Tiffany Moss 'caused the death
of the victim...by denying the victim enough food to live.'

Investigators confirmed that the girl had not eaten since October 24.

The
girl's father reportedly called police and told them that he was about 
to kill himself because of the guilt he felt from his daughter's death.

He was not forthcoming with the true reason for his guilt, however, claiming his daughter 'drank some kind of chemical'.

Though
he initially said the girl's body was inside the apartment beside him, 
officers responding to the scene found the deranged man outside his 
apartment, he then pointed to a trash can across the parking lot.

Eman Moss told police 'he panicked and did not know what to do' after his daughter died.

The
Atlanta Journal constitution says that he later told police that he put
Emani's body in the trash can in front of their Lawrenceville apartment
building and then tried burning the corpse.

Officers
were on the scene Monday morning and WSBTV said that the girl's body 
had yet to be removed from the garbage can, but they were waiting for 
the medical examiner to arrive.

Both Eman and Tiffany Moss face felony charges of murder, first-degree child cruelty and concealing a death.
