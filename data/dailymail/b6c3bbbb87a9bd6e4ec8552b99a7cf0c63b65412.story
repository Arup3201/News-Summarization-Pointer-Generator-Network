Rant: Ukip's Robert Ray argued with police officers after being caught drink-driving in a hotel car park

A Ukip councillor launched a 2am drunken tirade at police after attending a fundraiser with Nigel Farage and declared: 'Do you know who I am?'

Robert Ray, 65, was caught drink-driving by the officers in the car park of a four-star Essex hotel where he had been socialising with the party leader.

Ray has apologised after he was fined £600 and handed a 19-month driving ban - but insisted he was only moving the car to help his collapsed wife.

A court heard she died three months later, although it was not explained whether her death and the car park collapse were linked. 

The councillor, who previously made headlines when he was outed as a 1977 National Front candidate, was at the Orsett Hall country hotel last June in Thurrock, Essex, where he sits a borough councillor.

Basildon Magistrates' Court heard staff advised him not to drive in his drunken state before calling police when they saw Ray walk towards his silver Peugeot 406 in the car park.

It led to an angry confrontation which ended in Ray being breathalysed and recording a score of 75mg of alcohol in 100ml of breath - more than twice the drink-drive limit of 35mg. 

Samantha Doyle, prosecuting, said: 'The officers told him they had received a call and asked him if he had been drinking. He told them he "had had a couple".

'Mr Ray then became agitated and gestured at the officers and shouted that he had been at an event with Nigel Farage, adding: "Do you know who I am? I am a prominent person and a councillor. I am a powerful man." 

Ray refused to take a breathalyser test and was arrested as his wife lay ill at the side of the car.

Miss Doyle added: 'Mr Ray told them he wasn't on the road, but he was told if he didn't consent to a breath test he would be arrested. He refused - the time was 2.15am.

'Mr Ray was ranting and raving and told the officers he knew the police commissioner and the chief constable. He was arrested and an ambulance was called.'  

Apology: Basildon magistrates heard Ray was trying to help his wife Maggie (with him right), also a Ukip councillor, who had collapsed between two parked cars. She died three months after the incident

Jeremy Sirrell, mitigating, argued his client had never intended to drive but was merely moving his car to treat his wife, who had fallen heavily between two parked cars.

'What happened was that his wife fell down and was on the floor at the side of the car,' said Mr Sirrell. 'Mr Ray was not able to get to her to help her because of where it was parked.

'Inevitably he had to move the car and was doing so when the police arrived.

'He was upset at being questioned by the police because he felt he was within his rights to drive the vehicle, because Orsett Hall is not a public place and there is case law to that effect.

'He does accept he drove the car, but only to move it to get to his wife, to help her.'

Ray's wife Maggie O'Keefe-Ray, also a Ukip councillor, collapsed from a brain haemorrhage two months after the incident and later died.

Fundraiser: Ray was 'ranting and raving' outside the four-star Orsett Hall hotel in Thurrock, Essex (above)

The court did not hear whether her collapse outside the fundraiser in June and her death, which happened in September, were linked. 

Ray, from South Ockendon, Essex, was fined £600, ordered to pay costs of £500 and a victim surcharge of £60. He was also banned from driving for 19 months. 

The councillor released a short statement through Ukip which said: 'I deeply regret this unfortunate incident which was entirely out of character and I apologise to all of my residents.'

A spokesman said Ray is now facing a disciplinary procedure within the party.

The councillor made headlines in September 2013 when it was revealed he had stood as a candidate for the National Front in Newham, east London, in 1977. 

Ray said at the time he had severed all ties with the party decades ago and openly declared his past when he joined Ukip.
