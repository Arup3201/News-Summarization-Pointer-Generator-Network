A Tennessee woman is facing multiple charges including attempted first-degree murder for driving around shooting at people, leading  a police chase, and pointing her gun at an officer.

Julia Shields, 45, drove around a Chattanooga neighborhood Friday just before 4pm dressed in body armor, randomly shooting into vehicles, WRCB reports.

Officers responded to a call from two victims who said Shields pulled up to their vehicle at a stop sign in a dark colored sedan and began firing into the car. No one was reportedly hurt.

Soon, police received several calls about the woman firing into other vehicles or pointing a loaded gun at drivers, threatening to shoot, as she drove by, WCYB reports. 

A witness told WRCB that Shields approached a vehicle with her window down, poised to shoot.

'She had black baseball cap on,' the witness said. 'Her hair was frizzy and pulled back. And I just saw, like, a silver  9 millimeter pointed outside.'

She allegedly fired into two vehicles, and pointed her gun threateningly at several others.

Officers found Shields in a church parking lot and when the patrol cars approached, Shields fled, leading the officers on a chase.

Shields pointed her gun at motorists as she passed them while leading the police chase, WDEF reports.

Flee: After her shooting spree, Shields parked her sedan in this church parking lot only to flee when cops found her

Chase: Photographed is Highway 153 and Hixson Pike where Shields alleged led officers on a police chase

She led the officers down Highway 153 and Hixson Pike, according to WDEF. 

The short chase ended at an intersection where Shields allegedly pointed her gun at an officer.

Shields was taken into custody without incident or injury and charged with three counts of attempted first-degree murder, seven counts of aggravated assault, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, felony evading arrest, and felony reckless endangerment, according to WRCB.

As of Saturday night, Shields was being held at the Hamilton County Jail, according to WCYB.
