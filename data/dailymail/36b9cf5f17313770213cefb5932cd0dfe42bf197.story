Thousands of bears are being detained in minute cages for the entirety of their lives and forced to endure regular painful procedures so that their bile can be regularly harvested.

At least 20,000 of the once majestic mammals are estimated to be trapped in bear bile facilities across Vietnam, Korea, China, Laos and Myanmar, according to Luke Nicholson, a regional project manager for World Animal Protection.

'They sit in metal cages that are elevated off the ground and they are denied basic animal welfare conditions,' Mr Nicholson, who has travelled to Vietnam at least five times in the last year to visit these facilities and negotiate with governments, told Daily Mail Australia.

At least 20,000 bears like this one, are estimated to be trapped in bear bile facilities across Vietnam, Korea, China, Laos and Myanmar

The are mostly kept in cages no larger than a telephone booth for the entirety of their lives, fed unnatural diets and put through torturous procedures so that their bile can be regularly harvested 

'It's very hard to go back and see the same bear in that same cage and see that he's getting older and yet he's done nothing over the last few years except sit in that cage,' Luke Nicholson, a regional project manager for World Animal Protection, said

'I've been doing this for a number of years now and it's very hard to go back and see the same bear in that same cage and see that he's getting older and yet he's done nothing over the last few years except sit in that cage.

'It's distressing. It upsets me greatly. Bile facilities are horrible places.'

The bile 'farm' business revolves around the demand for bear bile, which is extracted from the animal's liver before being turned into powders, ointments and capsules.

'Bile, or Ursodeoxycholic acid, is an organic product that actually does have some pharmaceutical and therapeutic value - but nothing outside what you can achieve from a paracetamol,' Mr Nicholson said. 

The bile facilities, such as the one pictured, are located throughout Asia and are regulated by different laws, depending on the country 

Methods of bile extraction also vary from country to country: This bear, in Vietnam, is knocked out with a strong tranquilliser each month before a large syringe or catheter is inserted deep into his gall bladder

In South Korea, where it is legal to breed bears and slaughter them at 10 years of age for the sole purpose of extracting bile, the mammals are bred and caged for their entire lives before being killed. The bile (pictured in the clear bottle) is then extracted or the gall bladder harvested

'There's no excuse or reason why these animals should be suffering for what can be replaced by herbal and synthetic alternatives.

'The myths and traditional Asian medicinal belief is that it can be used to cure a number of ailments; hangovers are a common one in Vietnam and it has also been suggested that it can ease suffering from liver disease and damage. It's often added to things like haemorrhoid creams and it has even been called a cure all – some people believe it can cure cancer.'

Aside from 'medicinal purposes', the fluid is also used for entertainment purposes, according to World Animal Protection, and is drunk to demonstrate affluence. In recent years it has also been added to various lifestyle and beauty products such as energy drinks, toothpaste and shampoo.

To extract the bile, the bears are mostly subject to torturous procedures, which vary from country to country due to the different laws that are in place. 

The bile is used in a wide range of products. Pictured: Liquid bear bile and bile flakes that have been dried

'Bile, or Ursodeoxycholic acid, is an organic product that actually does have some pharmaceutical and therapeutic value - but nothing outside what you can achieve from a paracetamol,' Mr Nicholson said

In Vietnam, Mr Nicholson said it is 'legal to keep bears, but illegal to exploit them for commercial purposes' and therefore illegal to extract bile from a live bear and sell the products.

However there is a lack of compliance with these laws in the country, and the most common technique of bile extraction involves knocking the bear out with a powerful tranquillizer each month before inserting a large syringe or catheter deep into the bear's gall bladder to extract the bile.

In South Korea, where it is legal to breed bears and slaughter them at 10 years of age for the sole purpose of extracting bile, the mammals are bred and caged for their entire lives before being killed. The bile is then extracted or the gall bladder harvested.

In China, where it is also legal to own a captive bear and extract its bile, the most common technique involves 'farmers' luring the animals into minute cages where they can barely move before piercing through the bear's abdominal wall into the gall bladder to create a permanent hole. 

Mr Nicholson is part of a team currently negotiating with the governments in South Korea and Vietnam to help bring an end to the industry

'In South Korea we are actually progressing quite well. We are currently looking at property rights issues concerning those bears and compensating farmers to exit the industry - and that's looking promising,' he said

He added: 'In Vietnam we are working to progress towards improved legislation and policy so no new bears are able to enter the industry'

Typical Chinese methods of bile extraction involve creating a permanent hole in the bear's abdominal wall and gall bladder which is regularly prevented from healing, causing extreme pain and medical problems

'A steel needle is then inserted into the hole and the bile is drained at regular intervals. Alternatively a "free dripping fistula technique" is used whereby a tube is then passed into the gall bladder, typically twice daily, to extract the bile,' World Animal Protection explains.

'Either way the wound is painful and bile can seep back into the abdomen, causing severe infection. The hole in their abdominal wall is regularly prevented from healing - this not only causes extreme pain but can lead to inflammation, abscesses, gall bladder stones and infections.'

In most of the countries, the animals spend their entire lives in cages no larger than a telephone booth and often scar themselves from repeatedly hitting themselves against the bars in frustration.

Unnatural diets, including rice or vegetable gruel, as well as their constant cramped conditions, lead to agonising health problems.

The organisation is working alongside the government in each of these countries to improve legislative outcome for bears.

A bear's paw sits in a jar of fluid at a Vietnamese stall: Mr Nicholson urges anyone who wants to know how they can help, to avoid taking part in activities in which wildlife is exploited

'Souvenirs, trinkets, tiger teeth, riding of elephants - all these sort of things have a negative impact on the welfare of wild animals – people need to think what their actions are doing to animals,' he said 

Mr Nicholson is part of a team currently negotiating with the government in South Korea to ban the breeding of bears which he said would 'signal an end to the industry'. 

'In South Korea we are actually progressing quite well. We are currently looking at property rights issues concerning those bears and compensating farmers to exit the industry - and that's looking promising,' he said.

'In Vietnam we are working to progress towards improved legislation and policy so no new bears are able to enter the industry, but until we can have a quantified number of captive numbers, which we hope for by 2015, it's hard to say or indicate the end date for the industry.'
