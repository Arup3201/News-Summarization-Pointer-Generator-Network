Two criminals have gone on the run after escaping from open prison, including one who was jailed for firearms offences.

Philip Stephenson, 33, and Gareth Robinson, 24, fled HMP Kirkham in Lancashire together yesterday.

Stephenson was serving a sentence for firearms offences while Robinson was in prison for burglary, Greater Manchester Police said.

Stephenson, according to the Oldham Chronicle, had been charged with selling or transferring an illegal firearm and possession of five rounds of live ammunition.

They are believed to have got into a silver Volkswagen Golf before heading to the Oldham area, where they are both originally from.

Detective Chief Inspector John Mazzolai said: 'Neither of these men has been seen since they escaped from prison on Saturday.

Michael Wheatley, who earned the nickname 'Skull Cracker' after pistol-whipping his victims, went on the run in May before being recaptured

'They are not to be approached by members of the public, but if anyone sees them or knows of their whereabouts, please contact GMP on 101 immediately.

'If you would prefer to pass on information anonymously, then you can do this by calling Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

'I would also like to remind people that if anyone is found to be assisting or harbouring these wanted men, they too will face being arrested and a possible prison sentence of their own.

'So please get in touch if you know where they are.'

There has been a flurry of controversy over open prisons after a spate of inmates went on the run.

In the most high-profile case, Michael Wheatley, who is known as the 'Skull Cracker', carried out a raid on a building society while on the run from HMP Standford Hill in Kent in May.

Wheatley is believed to have caught a train from HMP Standford Hill, Kent, to London where he raided the Chelsea Building Society in Sunbury-on-Thames.

He was arrested in Tower Hamlets, east London, where he is originally from, after a five-day manhunt.

He was given the nickname 'Skull Cracker' after pistol-whipping several of his victims, including a 73-year-old woman.
