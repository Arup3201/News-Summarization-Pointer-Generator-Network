Councils are using CCTV-style cameras to catch parents who park illegally when dropping off or picking up pupils from school.

The cameras are timed to switch on during the school run and zoom in on the number plates of parents who stop in restricted zones.

They then record footage of the registration number and parking sign and send it as a ‘video and data package’ to councils.

Target: Parents on the school run will be hit with fines from CCTV-style cameras that are currently being trailed by councils across the country (library image)

This information can help local 
authorities issue fines of up to £120 to families who stop outside 
schools to let their children out.

The
surveillance system is being made available to councils across the 
country for £16,000 by the manufacturer Videalert, which specialises in 
traffic management.

Bosses 
at the firm say five councils in London and at least two others outside 
the capital are testing the system, but refused to say which they were.

Surveillance: CCTV-style cameras, similar to this one in London, are to be trialled by several councils across the country

The
firm says it developed the system after being approached by a council 
concerned about the safety of pupils in the chaos outside school gates.

According to insurance industry figures, more than 1,000 children a month are injured on roads around British schools.

Tim
Daniels, a Videalert director, said: ‘Head teachers had been 
complaining about the parking outside their schools and worrying about 
the safety of children.

‘Since
the first trials started over the summer we have been inundated with 
requests from other councils across the country asking about the 
system.’

Yesterday, Enfield
Council confirmed that it had launched a pilot of the technology but 
said it was too early to decide whether to buy it.

The system has angered motoring campaigners, who said it would give councils another chance to use parents as cash cows.

Alex
Henney, the general secretary of the National Motorists Action Group, 
claimed the cameras were illegal because government guidance said they 
should not be used routinely.

The
Scottish actor Tom Conti, 71, who drops his grandchild off at school in
London, compared the camera system to surveillance by the Stasi.

He said: ‘The councils are doing this for revenue. To target parents is frankly disgusting.’

Mr Daniels said his system was three times cheaper than camera cars, which were often used to police school parking.

He
told The Sunday Times: ‘Our system can be fixed to existing street 
furniture and programmed to look for specific school-gate offences such 
as parking on a zigzag line for more than three seconds.’

Anger: Eric Pickles has hit out at councils who were using parking enforcement powers as a 'cash cow' instead of a way to curb crime

It
comes after a number of ‘lollipop rage’ incidents outside schools, 
where parents have become involved in disputes about parking and other 
issues.

According to the Local Government Association, There were 7,000 such incidents in 2011, up from 1,400 in 2008.

But
Department for Transport guidance says CCTV should only be used to 
enforce parking rules when it is impractical to use traffic wardens.

When
CCTV is used, drivers only find out they have been caught when a fixed 
penalty ticket drops through their letter box some time later, making it
harder to challenge the fine.

Brandon Lewis, Local Government Minister said: 'The law is clear. Parking is not a tax or cash cow for local councils. This Government wants to rein in over-zealous parking enforcement, including stopping the use of CCTV spy cameras for parking, so it focuses on supporting sensible drivers, not raising money.

'Public confidence is strengthened in CCTV if it is used to tackle serious crime, not to raise money for council coffers by penalising parents dropping off kids on the school run.'

Councils
are on track to make £635million profit from parking this year - with 
income from fines and penalties alone topping £340million.

Earlier
this year, Eric Pickles hit out at councils who were using parking 
enforcement powers as a ‘cash cow’ instead of a way to curb crime.

The Communities and Local Government Secretary said that councils using parking to supplement their income were acting ‘outside the law’ and should be stopped.

He
said: ‘We are worried that what is happening in local authorities is 
they are using parking fines as a kind of a cash cow from motorists. The
legislation is very clear, you cannot do so.’
