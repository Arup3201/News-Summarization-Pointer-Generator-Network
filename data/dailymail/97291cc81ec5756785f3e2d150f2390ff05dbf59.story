As judgement day approaches for many of his players, Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal spent Wednesday evening dining out in the city.

The Dutchman was accompanied by his wife Truus at San Carlo, a restaurant favoured by footballers and the famous ranging from Mario Balotelli to Rhianna.

Another recent arrival in Manchester, Frank Lampard, was also seen enjoying the Italian cuisine and celebrity ambience  as he prepares for a short-term loan spell at rivals Manchester City.

Van Gaal only arrived back in Manchester on Tuesday after returning from the club's unbeaten pre-season tour of the United States, leaving him very little time to become accustomed to his new surroundings.

The 62-year-old has stated that he would run the rule over all his players on tour before making a decision on their futures - leaving the likes of Anderson, Nani, Javier Hernandez and Wilfried Zaha sweating.

The Dutchman has admitted he wants to sign new defenders before the season starts, but he concedes landing his targets will prove hard.

'Manchester United shall buy players when we can improve our selection,' the United manager said.

'And it's a lot more difficult than you think'.
