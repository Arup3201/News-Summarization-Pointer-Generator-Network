The family of a five-year-old girl who was shot dead while sitting on her grandfather's lap have donated her heart to save the life of another child. 

Laylah Petersen was killed when a dozen bullets were fired at her Milwaukee home.

One entered through the wall and hit her in the head while she sat on the couch.

Investigators said there was no clear motive for the shooting and they needed the public's help to find those responsible.

During an emotional press conference, Police Chief Edward Flynn said he would keep a photo of the victim in his chest pocket, next to the photos of his own grandchildren, until suspects are arrested.

Tragic: Laylah Petersen, five, was shot and killed Thursday when two gunmen opened fire on her Milwaukee home as she sat on her grandfather's lap

Helping save a life: Her family have announced that her heart is being donated so another child has the chance to survive 

'She is going to be in our hearts, like her little baby heart is going to be in somebody else's,' he said.

'We know that as awful as this event has been, she is going to live on and save a life.'

No arrests have been made in the Thursday evening shooting. Investigators have said they don't believe anyone in the home, where Laylah was being raised by her grandparents, was being targeted. 

Flynn said officers were getting good tips and canvassing the neighborhood for witnesses. He urged anyone with possible information to come forward, saying 'at this point, rumors are as helpful as facts.' 

He said the house may have been mistakenly targeted, but that several theories were being explored. Without elaborating, he said investigators were having some success with physical evidence and were 'in a different place today than we were yesterday.' Police have said officers found a dozen casings at the scene, and were looking into whether more than one handgun was used.

Message: During the conference family spokesman Richard Schwoegler III said Laylah's heart had been donated and urged faith-based organizations to take to the streets to build relationships with troubled people 

The chief said his officers 'are not going to rest until we find the perpetrators of this vicious crime to justice.'

Laylah's relatives tearfully hugged officers during Saturday's news conference, and her aunt, Tracy Martinez, said family was especially grateful to the first officers on the scene.

Family spokesman Richard Schwoegler III said Laylah's heart had been donated. He also urged faith-based organizations to take to the streets in an effort build relationships with troubled people. Flynn said so far 11 children under the age of 13 have been shot this year in Milwaukee, compared to two last year.

A funeral is planned for Wednesday. A reward of up to $5,000 is being offered for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the case.

Father: Laylah's father, Robert Petersen, said he was trying to better himself so he could give his children, who were being raised by their grandparents at the time, the life they deserved

Aunt: Amanda Legler, Laylah's aunt, spoke through tears in front of the Milwaukee home and demanded justice for her slain niece 

Police said officers had no previous calls to the home, and they don't believe anyone living there was targeted.

'We believe that this bullet read, 'To whom it may concern.' And that concerns all of us, and that should concern everybody in our community,' Capt. Aaron Raap said during a news conference on Friday. 'If you saw something, say something. If you hear something, say something.'

Raap said initial descriptions of the shootings as being 'targeted' referred to the fact that all 12 bullets fired hit the house. Officers found a dozen casings at the scene, and were looking into whether more than one handgun was used. They also were interviewing witnesses and seeking any possible surveillance video.

Rapp said in a conference on Friday that investigators are 'vigorously following up on leads' but officials are 'befuddled' as to the motive behind the crime, according to Fox6Now.  

Police Chief Edward Flynn said two young children were being raised by their grandparents in the house, where people left flowers, toys and other items in a makeshift memorial for the little girl Friday.

'This is a stable, loving, working family in a stable working-class neighborhood where everybody is trying to do the right thing,' Flynn said.

Wild Child: Legler said that Laylah was a 'wild child,' 'full of life, and the 'happiest child you'll ever meet'

Vigil: A Facebook page indicates that a candlelight vigil will be held for the child Sunday

In an interview with Fox, Laylah's father, Robert Petersen, said his daughter was his 'whole life' and described her as 'the sweetest little girl, so smart and so beautiful.'

'I've never felt this pain in my life,' Petersen said. 'All I've been trying to do is better myself so one day I can take [my children] and give them the life that they deserve.'

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has offered a reward of up to $5,000 for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the case. 

'There is no reason conceivable that I can think of that would explain this wanton, violent act,' Flynn told reporters Thursday night. 'We are going to find (the shooters). We are going to arrest them. And they are going to jail.' 

Shots: Twelve shots burst through the home Thursday at 6pm and one of the bullets pierced a wall then struck the five-year-old in the head

Reward: The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has offered a reward of up to $5,000 for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the case of the shooting that took place in the child's Milwaukee home (above)

Laylah's aunt Amanda Legler, spoke in front of the home saying that Laylah was a 'wild child' and 'full of life.'

'Just last week we went trick-or-treating and she told me Ti-Ti Manna, I love you more than science,' Lelger told the Journal Sentinel. 'That was just Laylah, she was so bizarre and so cute. She was just the happiest child you'll ever meet.' 

A Facebook page indicates that a candlelight vigil will be held for the girl on Sunday. 

Laylah is the third child under age 13 whose death was considered a homicide this year in Milwaukee, Lt. Mark Stanmeyer said. But the city has seen fewer homicides this year than last, 76 compared to 93 at the same time in 2013. At this point last year, four children under 13 had been killed.
