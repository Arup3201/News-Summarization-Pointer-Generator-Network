Arrogant and reckless, bankers at UBS nicknamed one another the ‘three muscateers’, ‘superman’ and ‘Captain Caos’ as they rigged a crucial City interest rate.

And yesterday their corruption cost their City of London employer a fine of nearly £1billion.

Watchdogs said rigging the Libor interest rate – used to calculate the mortgages of millions – was ‘routine, widespread and condoned by a number of managers’ at UBS.

UBS has been fined nearly £1bn for the Libor-rigging scandal which included a record £160m fine from the FSA

The regulators also said the behaviour
of some staff was ‘even more serious’ than what happened at Barclays – 
fined £290million earlier this year for rigging Libor.

A string of compromising emails reveal
the UBS bankers’ congratulatory nicknames, though it appeared that, 
despite their huge salaries, they were as reckless with their spelling 
as they were with the bank’s cash.

An Italian judge has found four international banks guilty of fraud in a case involving the sale of derivatives to the city of Milan and ordered the confiscation of €88 million.

Judge Oscar Magi on Wednesday convicted Deutsche Bank, UBS, JP Morgan and Depfa Bank, as well as nine current and former bankers.

In Italy, institutions may be held responsible as well individuals.

The individuals received suspended sentences of six months to eight months.

The banks have denied wrongdoing.

Prosecutors allege that the city of Milan lost €105million as part of the sale of bonds totaling €1.69billion between 2005 and 2007.

Prosecutor Alfredo Robledo said the verdict recognized the importance of 'the fundamental principal of transparency on the part of banks in contracts with public administrations.'

A 40-page report from the Financial 
Services Authority condemns staff at UBS for Libor rigging between 
January 2005 and December 2010.

The regulator fined UBS £160million, with the remainder of the total fine split between Swiss and US regulators.

The FSA said that staff fixed Libor 
rates to benefit their own trading activities. They also rigged Libor 
during the financial crisis to make the bank appear stronger than it 
was.

They set up fictitious and ‘corrupt’ 
transactions to pay each other for Libor-rigging and, said the FSA, 
awareness of such wrongdoing went as high as managerial level.

The City watchdog said their 
activities ‘undermined the integrity’ of the benchmark rate, which is 
used to calculate financial transactions worth more than £300trillion, 
including mortgage rates.

Extracts from messages exchanged between UBS staff reveal their astonishing arrogance.

In one, ‘Trader A’ asks a broker at 
another firm to help him set a high rate, addressing his friend as 
‘superman’ and urging him to ‘be a hero today’.

A broker at another bank accepted the 
challenge of rigging Libor with glee, telling Trader A he was ‘putting 
the captain caos outfit on as we speak’. Trader A was named as one of 
‘three muscateers’.

Such was the regularity of 
manipulation that one banker, in response to a single request to fix 
Libor, replied ‘Standing order, sir?’

The FSA said misconduct at UBS was 'extensive and widespread' with traders routinely trying to benefit their trading positions

Sergio Ermotti, chief executive of UBS, said the group had 'taken decisive and appropriate actions' following the probe

The FSA said the UBS case was 
‘considerably more serious than Barclays’ because the wrongdoing was 
more widespread and senior managers were aware of it. It raised 
particular concern over one exchange, in which a UBS trader offered to 
pay a broker friend if he will leave the rate unchanged.

The trader wrote: ‘I’ll pay you, you know, 50,000 dollars, 100,000 dollars ...whatever you want. I’m a man of my word.’

Such rewards were arranged through 
so-called ‘wash trades’, risk-free trades that cancelled each other out 
but generated ‘illicit fees’ of more than £170,000 for brokers.

The traders quoted in the FSA’s report
have not been named, but two UBS staff – 33-year-old Briton Tom Hayes 
and Roger Darin, 41, based in Switzerland – were yesterday charged in 
the US with conspiracy to fix Libor. They face the prospect of 
extradition.

The FSA said the behaviour at UBS showed a ‘total disregard for proper standards’.

Some 40 staff were involved in making 
more than 1,000 ‘improper requests’, while a further 70 would have been 
aware of the wrongdoing.

UBS chief Sergio Ermotti said: ‘We deeply regret this inappropriate and unethical behaviour.’

The revelations are another blow to 
the Swiss bank’s deals reputation, after trader Kweku Adoboli was found 
guilty of fraud earlier this year after his bad deals lost £1.4billion.

The Financial Services Bill, which 
received Royal Assent yesterday creates a criminal offence for making 
‘misleading statements’ in relation to benchmark rates such as Libor.

Andrew Tyrie MP, who is leading the 
Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, said the FSA report had 
exposed ‘collusion, corruption and much else besides.’
