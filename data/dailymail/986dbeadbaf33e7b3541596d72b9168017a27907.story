Killed: An Audi driver, named locally as Delano Moore (pictured), died when his car hit a double-decker bus, injuring 13 people

An Audi driver who died when his car hit a double-decker bus, injuring 13 people was 'racing' another car at 110mph, according to the bus driver.

The driver, named locally as father-of-three Delano Moore, 25, died when when his blue A4 was involved in an accident with a bus in Clapton, east London, at around 2.20am today.

He was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash, while his front seat passenger was fighting for his life in hospital tonight, where doctors described his condition as 'critical'.

Two other men in their twenties, who were in the back of the car, were also taken to hospital after they had to be cut free from the wreckage of the car by firefighters. 

They are both described as 'serious but stable'.

Ten people on the N38 bus were treated as 'walking wounded', Scotland Yard 
said, and some were taken to hospital, including a man in his 60s who had injured his back.

Police are appealing for witnesses to the crash, and are particularly keen to trace the driver of the second car involved.

A colleague of the bus driver, who suffered a suspected broken leg and a cut to the head in the collision, said two cars were racing down Lea Bridge Road when one collided head on with the oncoming bus.

In a text to other bus drivers, the colleague said: 'The N38 was travelling towards Walthamstow at 20mph.

'Two cars were racing at between 90mph and 110mph as the N38 was approaching an island.

'The gap was closing in as one car tried to take over another car, where the car went head on with the bus.

'One passenger in the car flew through the windscreen, the driver died and the passenger survived.

'The bus driver was left with a bleeding head, the car was demolished.'

Another bus driver added: 'The driver of the N38 is fine, though he’s had a broken leg and a few stitches.

'It was in no way his fault.'

Shondi Davis, the mother of Mr Moore's three daughters arrived at the crash scene with friends to pay tribute to him, laying flowers at the roadside along with bottles of Guinness in his memory.

'I got the call at 5am, I was crying, I'm still in shock. No one believes this has happened to him,' she said.

'I spoke to him yesterday on the phone.

'But he's at peace now, and we're here to pay our respects.

'He worked at Morrisons in Chingford.

'He was a loving father who'll never be forgotten. His daughters are the spitting image of him.

'He was a partier, he was always out enjoying himself, he was very loud.

'It was an accident as far as I know, I don't know if he was racing.'

A message attached to flowers at the scene read: 'Larn, Babe, I got ya and the girls. Always with me Babe, love xx'

Another read: 'To my darlin baby dad, I love you so much, me and your angels. Gone but never forgotten RIP xxx'

The Metropolitan police have not commented on the racing claims.

A
 Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Police were called at around 2.20am 
today to reports of a car in collision with a Route N38 bus in Lea 
Bridge Road with the junction of Essex Wharf.

'London Ambulance Service and London Fire Brigade were also called to the scene.

'The
 male driver was pronounced dead at the scene of the collision. Another 
man who was in the car was taken to an east London hospital where his 
condition is described as critical.

'Two
 further men who were in the back of the car suffered injuries. They are
 in a serious but stable condition at an east London hospital. The four 
men are believed to be in their early to mid-twenties.

'The bus was travelling toward Whipps Cross.

Casualties: Three others in the car were also injured, one critically, while 10 people on the N38 bus were treated as 'walking wounded'

'Ambulance
 crews also treated about 10 walking wounded who were passengers on the 
bus. A number of those were taken to hospital by another bus supplied by
 Transport for London. We await further details but it is thought they 
all suffered minor injuries.

'It
 is believed that the car was travelling with or closely behind another 
vehicle along Lea Bridge Road. The driver of this second vehicle may be a
 vital witness and is urged to contact police.

'The Serious Collision Investigation Unit at Chadwell Heath is investigating. There have been no arrests.'

Witnesses
 said they heard a 'loud bang', that 'sounded like an explosion' before 
seeing the Audi, alleged to have been speeding on the wrong side of the 
road, 'practically under the bus'.

The
 three others in the car were also injured, one critically, while 10 
people on the N38 bus were treated as 'walking wounded', Scotland Yard 
said, and some were taken to hospital.

Wreck: One man in the car died, another was critically injured and the two men in the back had to be cut free by fire crews

A security guard at the former Lea Bridge Depot opposite the scene of the crash dialled 999 after he saw the crash.

'I heard a loud bang at about 1.55am and came out to investigate,' said the witness, who asked not to be named.

'I
 saw a car had collided with a night bus on the opposite side of the 
road. The car was practically under the bus on the driver’s side. The 
driver was dead.

'It was chaos. There were people standing around injured and climbing out of the bus. 

'I called the police and the paramedics and they came to the scene quickly.'

According to police sources, the car may have been speeding on the wrong side of the road, with the crash coming as the bus swerved to avoid it.

'When officers arrived at the scene the bus was 
very close to the verge, suggesting it may have swerved to try and avoid
 the car,' said the source.

Crash: The accident took place in Lea Bridge Road, at the junction with Essex Wharf in Clapton, east London. The N38 night bus was travelling towards Walthamstow Central when the accident took place

Asked if the car may have been trying to overtake another vehicle at speed, he said: 'We are not ruling out that possibility.'

He added: 'This is another tragedy of someone dying on the nation’s roads.

'This was a very serious accident so it is too soon to apportion blame.

'We will be going through the evidence with a fine tooth comb before we reach any conclusions.'

He added the road would be re-opened later today, once the clean-up operation was finished.

Fire
 crews from Homerton and Bethnal Green were also called to the crash 
site, and had to cut free the two passengers from the back of the car.

Roads
 from Chatsworth Road with the junction of Lea Bridge Road to Orient Way
 with the junction with Lea Bridge Road were closed and motorists were 
advised to avoid the area.

Anyone with information or who witnessed the collision is asked to call police on 101.

Damage: Rose Friggi, a mother-of-two who lives near the crash site said the collision 'sounded like an explosion'

This morning a wrecked blue car thought to be an Audi lay across a central reservation next to traffic lights close to the Lee Valley Ice Centre.

The N38, with destination of Walthamstow Central on the front, stood nearby, its left front corner crumpled and its right side angled into a grassy verge.

Rose Friggi, 32, a mother-of-two from nearby Paradise Park, said she heard what sounded like an explosion during the night.

'I was up in the night because my baby was sick,' she said.

'I heard what sounded like an explosion. My husband went to work at about 3am and he said there were police cars and a helicopter at the scene.'

Mike Weston, TfL’s Director of Buses, said: 'Our sympathies go out to the family and friends of the person who died after a car collided with a route N38 double deck bus at around 2.20 this morning on Lea Bridge Road at the junction of Essex Wharf, Clapton, E5.

'The emergency services attended the scene. TfL, the bus operator (Arriva) and the police will now undertake a full investigation into this incident.'

The road remained closed in both directions this morning, and four bus routes were diverted as a result of the closure.
