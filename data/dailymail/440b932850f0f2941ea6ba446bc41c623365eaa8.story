The Nationalists are running an offensive misogynistic campaign against female unionists such as J K Rowling, one of Labour's big beasts said today.

John Reid, the former Defence Secretary, accused the Yes side of employing the 'language of abuse' at women who speak up for the maintenance of the 300-year Union. 

And he criticised Alex Salmond's supporters of organising mass rallies and 'street mobs' to intimidate No campaigners.

 It comes a day after Lord Reid accused the Yes campaign of being anti-English for dubbing MPs who travelled to Scotland last week as Team Westminster. 

Harry Potter author J K Rowling was subjected to obscene online abuse from so-called 'cybernats' earlier this year after donating £1million to the No campaign. 

She was labelled a 'specky b******', a 'Union cow bag' and a 'disgrace' by fervent nationalists. Businesswoman Michelle Mone has also been attacked for warning of the dangers of Scottish independence. 

Lord Reid also criticised Nationalists for their rallies accusing the BBC of bias after its political editor Nick Robinson posed tough questions to Mr Salmond. 

 The former Labour Cabinet minister said: 'The language that I worry about is the language of abuse towards not only men, but women in particular - J K Rowling, Michelle Mone, the opponents of separatism. 

'The online abuse, the fact they are now demanding that reporters doing their jobs are sacked, the mass rallies, the street mobs - that's what worries me. 

'Thankfully I don't think that is anything that is anywhere near the heart of the vast majority of Scottish people. 

'I think we should conduct our arguments in a robust fashion but be careful in the language we use.' 

Lord Reid was speaking at a rally in Glasgow to highlight how independence would put thousands of shipbuilding jobs on the Clyde at risk. 

He described Mr Salmond as a 'used car salesman' who would not be straight with workers on the Clyde that their jobs could be at risk if the Union is broken.

Mr Reid also criticised SNP supporters for calling for BBC journalist Nick Robinson to be sacked

 'The interesting thing is that among the people who come to see the workers here in the west of Scotland there has been one notable absence - the First Minister of Scotland,' he said. 

'He will not come and look the workers in the eye despite repeated requests. 'I've got a simple message. What would you say to a used car salesman who would not look you in the eye when selling you a car? You would no thanks - thanks, but no thanks. 

'And that's the simple message to people in Scotland over the next few days. A No vote is one to protect jobs, to create more jobs in the future, for our children and our grandchildren.' 

Lord Reid said jobs would be under threat because the UK would no longer commission warships from a foreign country - and because an independent Scotland would not need them. 

'The amount of money that Alex Salmond is going to spend on defence is going to come nowhere near what the UK puts in,' he said. 'The United Kingdom has never built a warship in its life outside the UK - why would it suddenly do that to please Alex Salmond?'

Yesterday, Lord Reid attacked the Yes campaign for describing dozens of English and Welsh MPs who travelled up to Scotland last week to support 'No' as 'Team Westminster'. 

'We know what they meant by Team Westminster, don't we? They meant English. 'You cannot build a decent, prosperous Scottish society on the basis of resentment.'
