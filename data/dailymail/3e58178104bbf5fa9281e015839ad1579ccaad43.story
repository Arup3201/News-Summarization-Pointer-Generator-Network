Their love grew through a shared passion for cycling and yesterday Sarah and Barney Storey were the undisputed golden couple of the Velodrome as they completed a Paralympic double.

Swimmer-turned-cyclist Sarah won her second gold of the Games in the C4/5 500m time-trial.

Earlier her able-bodied husband Barney picked up his own gold as a pilot when he guided visually impaired Scottish cyclist Neil Fachie to victory in the tandem one-kilometre time-trial.

The Velodrome crowd raised the roof to
roar Sarah to victory, just two days after she won the C5 
three-kilometre individual pursuit.

Trailing on her first lap of the 
women’s individual cycling time trial, the deafening cheers willed her 
on to smash her personal best time of 36.997 secs.

Sarah, 34, who has born with a partly 
formed left hand, said afterwards: ‘To come away with the gold medal at 
the end of my competition here at the Velodrome and hear that roar again
was just so proud, absolutely amazing.

‘If you move, everyone cheers. It feels like your own family has grown by 6,000 people. It was amazing.

‘It’s an incredible venue and I feel so lucky to have won in front of these fans.

‘I can’t remember the race. All I can remember is thinking I had to peddle as quick as I can.

‘To knock 0.4 seconds off my personal best was incredible. I just can’t tell you how excited I am.

Spectators with guide dogs were told yesterday that they could not be guaranteed their chosen seats at Paralympic venues.

The warning came after David Blunkett was forced to move by a ‘stroppy’ official when he attended last week’s opening ceremony with his guide dog, Cosby.

The former Home Secretary, 65, said he was made to sit in an ‘exposed, blustery gantry’ rather than his reserved spot.

But Games organisers Locog insisted the official had done nothing wrong – and said other guide dog owners might also be barred from the seats they had reserved at busy venues.

Instead, they may be moved ‘to allow dog and owner more room’.

Recalling his experience,  Mr Blunkett said that he felt  the official’s decision was  made ‘more out of panic than considered judgment’.

Just hours before her nail-biting 
finale she witnessed her husband Barney race to victory with his 
partially sighted partner Neil Fachie, setting a blistering pace in the 
blind and visually impaired tandem 1km time-trial.

The pair clocked an able-bodied world 
record to beat Spain’s Jose Enrique Porto and Jose Antonio Villanueva to
take gold witht he fastest time ever recorded on a tandem.

A beaming Storey said of her husband’s triumph: ‘I was so over moon watching Barney and then it was my turn.

‘They rode superbly, and now I am so pleased with that.’

Barney said he was delighted to have 
bagged a gold before his wife claimed her second of the Games: ‘I had to
try to do something to keep the male end up in the Storey household,’ 
he joked.

Sarah will now turn her attention to the road race and road time-trial at Brands Hatch next week.

A double gold there will see her equal Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson’s British female record of 11 Paralympic gold medals.

Her victory came on a Super Saturday, 
after ParalympicsGB brought their medal total to 28, putting them second
in the table with eight golds, 11 silvers and nine bronze medals.

Such is her natural ability, until 
December Storey was also in contention for a place at the Olympics as 
part of the team pursuit squad.

Organisers apologised yesterday for a scoring blunder that caused the wrong medals to be awarded in the women’s discus competition.

Just hours after Ukraine’s Mariia Pomazan received her gold medal on the first morning of the Games, it was confirmed the placings in the F35/36 category were incorrect – and she was relegated to second place.

China’s Wu Qing was promoted to the gold medal position from silver, while her compatriot, Bao Jiongyu, dropped from bronze to fourth.

Australia’s Katherine Proudfoot, was upgraded from fifth to third.

Chris Holmes, Locog director of Paralympic integration, said:  ‘Omega has explained what the  issue was in terms of the loading  of the correct data, it’s been worked through and resolved and obviously Omega and we also apologise for  that. We are confident that it won’t occur again.’

The trio of Dani King, Laura Trott and
Joanna Rowsell were eventually preferred and justified their selection 
by winning gold in a world record time.

But Storey wasted no time dwelling on 
the disappointment of being unable to join South African Blade runner 
Oscar Pistorius in the elite club of athletes who have represented their
country in both the Paralympic and Olympic Games.

On Wednesday she swept to victory in 
the C5 Pursuit final to win Great Britain’s first Paralympic gold of 
London 2012 and the eighth of her own career, breaking a world record 
for the 72nd time in her career in qualifying.

Blessed with a natural athletic 
prowess she has never allowed her disability to stop her playing sport 
as a child. ‘I just carried on as normal,’ she recalled. 

‘Netball at 
school, cricket in the back garden. I just learned to catch with one 
hand before I learned to catch with two.

Twenty years ago, as a shy and nervous
teenager, Sarah Bailey as she was then known, took part in her first 
Paralympics in Barcelona as a swimmer. She returned home two weeks later
with six medals, including two golds.

She has had to fight against her share
of prejudice though. When she returned from the 1996 Atlanta 
Paralympics to start at Leeds University with a haul of five Paralympic 
gold medals it still cut little ice in some quarters.

She tried to enrol at the town’s 
swimming club, but was turned away by the head coach on the grounds that
he ‘didn’t work with disabled swimmers’.

She was reduced to training 
with ‘the naughty kids’ who were only there because their parents made 
them go.

Storey’s solution was to train at her home in Stockport and 
commute to Leeds for her studies. The stress of it was so great that she
was struck down with chronic fatigue.

Still, ‘what doesn’t kill you’ 
she says, ‘only makes you stronger’.

She only turned to cycling in 2005 
after an ear infection ended her swimming career.

In a recent interview,
Sarah played down the challenges she has faced: ‘People get different 
things thrown at them in their lives.

‘Challenges are personal. What one 
finds easy, another finds difficult. I am not brave or courageous. I am 
just an athlete.’

After changing sports, Barney and Sarah met, not 
unexpectedly, through cycling in 2004 and married three years later.

She credits her husband with playing  a major role in her transformation from swimmer to cyclist.

She said: ‘His expertise in cycling is just phenomenal.

‘Before he was a tandem pilot he was an able-bodied solo cycling sprinter, riding World Cup events, spring grand prix in Europe.

‘Barney’s got an immense knowledge and background in cycling.

‘And when I came along, this big-shouldered raw swimmer, he just taught me everything I know.’

Sarah’s Paralympic tally now  
includes nine medals won at Games, 20 World Championship golds across 
two sports, and 23 European Championship titles.

She said of her latest 
success: ‘To compete in a home Games like this with all the crowds is a 
dream come true and I feel honoured to have been here.’
