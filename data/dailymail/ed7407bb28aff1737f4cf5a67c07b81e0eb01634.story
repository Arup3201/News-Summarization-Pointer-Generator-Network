New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie says no one will be getting naked when Prince Harry visits New Jersey in May.

A listener asked Christie on a radio call-in show Monday if there are any plans to make sure the prince behaves.

Christie says he'll be with Harry the entire time and that Queen Elizabeth II knows she can trust her grandson with the governor of New Jersey.

No nudity: Gov. Chris Christie has promised to keep an eye on Prince Harry to ensure there will be no mad antics when he visits the state in May

On his last U.S. visit, the third-in-line to the British throne was caught frolicking in the nude with a woman in Las Vegas after an alleged game of strip billiards. The governor says lots of young people make mistakes.

Christie, speaking on TownSquare Media's ‘Ask the Governor’ program, says he's thrilled the prince wants to see the damage caused by Superstorm Sandy and be helpful.

The 28-year-old prince will visit Washington, Denver, Colorado Springs, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut in a week-long trip which he hopes will highlight the work of his charities, particularly those supporting injured servicemen and women.

He will also be on official business on behalf of the British Government, helping to promote trade, commerce and tourism abroad.

Naughty prince: On his last trip to America, Prince Harry visited Las Vegas for a scandalous lads' holiday which ended in tabloid headlines

Christie will be showing the prince the damage caused by Superstorm Sandy, as he did with President Obama

Harry is still living down his last trip to the US, last August, 
when he enjoyed a ‘lads’ holiday’ in Las Vegas and was photographed 
naked playing a game of ‘strip billiards’ with a party of women in his 
£5,000-a-night hotel suite.

He has refused to apologise publicly for his antics, which caused huge embarrassment to the Royal Family, but has admitted that he let them down.

But last year he also completed his first, hugely successful, official solo royal tour to the Caribbean and Brazil, where he won admiration for his warmth and enthusiasm, dancing in the streets with locals and doing his best to race Usain Bolt, the fastest man on Earth.

According to sources, Harry, who recently returned from four months in Afghanistan as an Apache attack helicopter pilot, will undertake this latest trip in his own ‘indomitable style’.

It is sure to be a draw for royal fans as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who are expecting their first child in July, will not travel abroad this year, palace sources have confirmed.

Prince's cause: The 28-year-old Royal will also play in a polo tournament on behalf of Sentebale, the organisation he personally set up to help Aids orphans in Lesotho which he visited last month

Harry’s trip begins in Washington DC 
on May 9 with a visit to an exhibition on Capitol Hill to publicise the 
work of landmine clearance charity HALO trust.

He will also make a pilgrimage to the Arlington National Cemetery and aides have not ruled out a meeting with President Obama.

The main focus of the trip, however, 
will be the 2013 Warrior Games in Colorado Springs which will see more 
than 200 wounded servicemen, including a 35-strong British team, compete
in seven sports.

Harry will then fly on to New Jersey 
to visit an area affected by last year’s Hurricane Sandy and carry out 
several engagements in New York.

The highlight of this part of the trip 
is an event to publicise the GREAT Campaign, led by the Department for 
Culture, Media and Sport, to promote Britain.

Mischief managed: When in Vegas, Prince Harry, right, caused controversy when he was photographed naked with a group of women in his £5,000 a night hotel suite

And no trip to New York would  be 
complete without the prince attending, and perhaps trying his hand at, a
game of baseball.

He will end his tour on May 15 by playing in the 
Sentebale Polo Cup in Greenwich, Connecticut, a huge fundraising event 
for his charity.

Harry will travel on commercial 
flights to and from the US and will be accompanied by five staff, plus 
security.

The cost of the trip will be met largely by his charities but 
in part by taxpayers as he will be conducting some official business.

Fortunately for his security team 
there will be little chance for time off  – and certainly no visits to 
Las Vegas – as he needs to return to the UK to resume his military 
duties.

Close to heart: Prince Harry's trip will focus on his many charities, particularly those involving the rehabilitation of soldiers injured in service
