Rosie Huntington-Whiteley may be a household name, but her younger brother Toby is hot on her heels.

The 24-year-old hunk makes his television debut tonight in an ad for  Jacamo, showing off his dashing good looks in T-shirts and puffer jackets from the menswear brand's latest collection.

It may be decidedly less revealing than Toby's first campaign for Jacamo, in which he posed topless in a range of swimwear, but there's still no shortage of eye candy.

In the ad, which was filmed in Manchester, the 6ft 4in personal trainer is seen perusing a record store while sporting a navy blue jacket, his hair swooped back in a debonair style.

Another scene sees him posing in a black and white T-shirt, rolling up one sleeve to showcase his sizeable arm muscles. 

While it's not quite a feature length film, Toby showcases acting skills that could see him following his sister into Hollywood movies.

The Jacamo pieces modelled by Toby range price from £15  to £40

Jacamo spokesperson Cath Ryan said of the new ad: 'This is an extremely exciting time for Jacamo as we concentrate more on fashion and what makes men look and feel good.

'Toby was really excited to be involved and, with genetics already on his side, we knew he'd be a natural.' 

Toby may be new to modelling, but it looks like he may well have a thriving career ahead of him.

He has previously posted pictures of himself modeling on his Instagram account, where he also shares photos of his diet and exercise routine.

The Jacamo pieces modelled by Toby range in price from £15 for a monochrome T-shirt to £40 for a navy blue bomber jacket.

Toby first made waves in the modelling world in January with the launch of Jacamo's SS15 campaign.

In the ad, he showed he is every bit as body-confident as his sister, displaying his enviable abs in a pair of floral summer trunks.

Meanwhile,  Rosie is best known as a Victoria's Secret Angel as well as the face - and body - of Marks & Spencer's Autograph lingerie line.

The stunning blonde, who has been dating Jason Statham since 2010, has also tried her hand at acting, playing the role of Carly Spencer in 2011 film Transformers: Dark of the Moon.
