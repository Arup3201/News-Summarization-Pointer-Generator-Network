Waste: Britons will receive almost £50-worth of presents that they dislike this year

It's an all too familiar scenario - family opens presents, dislikes several of them, and mother shoves gifts to the back of a cupboard, never to be seen again.

If there's a receipt, the presents are returned and if not, they are given to someone else the year after.

But don't feel too bad for giving the wrong gift -  an incredible £2.1billion-worth of unwanted presents have been handed over this year alone.

The top three most unwanted gifts were clothing, at 30 per cent, closely followed by beauty products and toiletries at 29 per cent and trinkets and ornaments at 19 per cent.

Research by classified ads website Gumtree.com reveals the average UK adult will have received two unwanted presents, worth £43.50 in total.

Those most guilty of giving gift 
bloopers are friends, who account for 19 per cent of givers, mothers, accounting for 11 per cent, work 
colleagues, 10 per cent, and mothers-in-law at nine per cent.

But when it comes to showing our true feelings about presents, two-thirds of adults are too polite to say what they really think.

A brave six per cent will ask for the receipt, four per cent will politely admit that 
they don't like the gift and two per cent will say exactly what they
 think.

In the days after Christmas, one in five unwanted presents find themselves hidden away in the back of a cupboard.

A further 22 per cent are given to someone else as a gift and two per cent are thrown away.

Nearly
 half of adults would consider selling unwanted presents 
online, putting the money towards something that they really want.

Hamish Stone, from Gumtree.com, said: 'It's clear that some well-meaning friends and relatives have got it quite wrong.

'We'd urge anyone that wants to put their unwanted presents to good use to consider selling them online.'
