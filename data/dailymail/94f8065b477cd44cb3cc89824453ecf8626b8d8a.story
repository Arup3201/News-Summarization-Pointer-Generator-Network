Millions of commuters face fresh misery next week as London Underground workers plan a 72-hour walkout.

The strikes, which come a week ahead of the mayoral election, stretch over four days and will involve the people who maintain and upgrade the tracks who are unhappy with negotiations over pensions and benefits.

The Rail, Maritime and Transport 
union, which represents around 1,000 staff on the Tube Lines contracts, 
said its members will walk out at 4pm on Tuesday until the same time on 
Friday.

Maintenance workers on London Underground are set to take part in a walkout stretching over four days in a row over pensions and benefits

RMT general secretary Bob Crow said: 
'RMT members have delivered a massive mandate for action following a 
straightforward demand for parity with other Tube staff.

'This
dispute is about justice and about ensuring that all groups of staff 
under the umbrella of London Underground receive the same rights and 
benefits, and our members have no choice but to strike to secure those 
basic rights.

The staff work on the Piccadilly, 
Northern and Jubilee lines and provide a number of services, including 
emergency repairs, across the entire network.

Militant: Bob Crow says the strike is a bid to get parity with other Tube staff

The
row is over union demands for all Tube Lines staff to be allowed to 
join the Transport for London pension scheme and receive the same travel
concessions as those who work for London Underground.

RMT officials said the strike will have a 'widespread” impact on Tube services across the network.

The announcement follows a 4-1 vote in favour of industrial action in a ballot of union members.

Colin Stanbridge, chief executive of London Chamber of Commerce, said: 'The last thing London businesses need at the minute is another Tube strike costing millions in lost business and damaging the city's reputation especially with just 100 days to go to the Olympics.

'The RMT should call off this needless strike and work to find a settlement before any damage is done.'

Mr Crow continued: 'We have gone through all the negotiating channels but Tube Lines has refused to budge and have refused to engage in meaningful talks and that pig-headed approach has raised the temperature on the shop floor and has resulted in this strike action being called.

'Former Metronet employees have been allowed back into the Transport for London pension fund and now also have the same travel facilities as other LU employees.

'Tube Lines is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Transport for London and there is simply no excuse for refusing to give equal pension and pass rights.

'The union remains ready to talk, and 
the strong mandate for this industrial action shows Tube Lines and TfL 
the depth of anger there is over this blatant lack of fairness and 
justice.'

Tube Lines operations director Lee Jones said: 'A strike on this issue is completely unnecessary and will not achieve anything.

'We
urge the RMT leadership to end their strike threat and return to talks,
as it will only be resolved through constructive discussion.

'The
RMT's ballot showed that less than 44 per cent of its members voted in 
favour of strike action. Any action would be by maintenance staff, not 
Tube drivers and station staff.

The lines affected include the Jubilee, Piccadilly and Northern lines

Tens of thousands of NHS workers will 
take industrial action and other forms of protest next month in the 
continuing bitter row over pensions.

Unite said its 100,000 health service members will walk out on May 10, a
day after the Queen’s Speech, which is expected to include a 
Parliamentary Bill on the Government’s controversial reforms.

Other workers are expected to join the strike and there could be further industrial action in June.

Unite said its NHS members, including health visitors, pharmacists and 
paramedics, face paying an average of £30 a month more for their 
pensions.

The dispute has been raging for well over a year and sparked a strike by
more than 1.5 million public sector workers last November.

Unite said it expected other public sector unions to join the May 10 
action as part of the continuing campaign of opposition to the 
Government’s changes.

Officials pointed out that the pension reforms came against a backdrop 
of pay freezes and cuts in the public sector, and the prospect of 
regional pay being introduced.

National officer Rachael Maskell said: 'The Government is picking the 
pockets of health workers by an average of £30 a month in order to pay 
for pension changes which will see people having to work longer to get 
less.

'This disgraceful attack comes against a backdrop of pay freezes and the
threat of regional pay in the public sector. In the face of continued 
attacks, health workers will be stepping up their campaign and looking 
to join other public sector workers in taking action on May 10.'

Unite’s health members voted by more than 9-1 to reject the pension changes.

'Should
a strike go ahead, we have plans in place which will enable London 
Underground to operate Tube services on all three lines and to minimise 
any disruption.'

Earlier this month it was revealed that London Underground drivers could earn an extra £6,000 in bonus payments for working during the Olympics this summer.

Drivers are also in line for overtime payments, and enhanced pay packets for shifts which extend beyond 1.30am.

Previously, MPs have condemned payments to drivers as a 'bribe' and accused the unions of holding the public to ransom.

Underground drivers have been offered the latest terms by transport chiefs for a period covering nine weeks to the end of the Paralympics, according to a document seen by the Evening Standard.

A spokesman for London Mayor Boris Johnson said: 'It will come as no surprise to Londoners that, a week before the mayoral election, Ken Livingstone's RMT friend Bob Crow is trying to hit hard-working Londoners and businesses.'

Mr Livingstone's deputy mayoral running mate, Val Shawcross, said: 'The failure of Boris Johnson and the RMT to resolve their differences comes at a huge cost to Londoners. Now millions of Tube users are facing the huge inconvenience and disruption that comes with a Tube strike.

'It has been 1,444 days since Boris Johnson was elected and he has still not bothered to meet representatives of the Tube unions to discuss his manifesto promise to implement a no-strike deal.

'Boris Johnson's failure to get a grip of the Tube has led to more Tube strikes in the last four years than in the previous eight years.'

Caroline Pidgeon, Liberal Democrat chairman of London Assembly's Transport Committee, said: 'This is a dispute between Tube Lines and the RMT.

'For the RMT to try and involve innocent Tube users in an internal disagreement is totally out of order, especially given the damage it will do to London's economy.

'Both sides should get back round a table, hammer out a solution and the RMT should stop posturing.'
