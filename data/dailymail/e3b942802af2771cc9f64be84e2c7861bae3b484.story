Thinking up names for children is always a tricky decision for any parents.

But when one expectant mother gave birth in the back of the family car on the way to hospital, the proud parents did not look any further for inspiration.

Instead, the baby girl was given the distinctive middle name Zafira after the Vauxhall people carrier which she was born in.

Inspiration: Corin and Paul Stokes gave their daughter the unique middle name of Zafira after she was born in the popular Vauxhall people carrier on the way to hospital

Corin Stokes, 31, gave birth to Lyla May Zafira Stokes on her way to Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, in the early hours of Sunday morning.

Mrs Stokes, from Royston, Hertfordshire, delivered the baby herself in the back seat as shocked husband Paul drove.

She said: 'It's not the sort of thing you expect to happen.

'But I knew she wouldn't be long as my other children have all been early.'

Emergency: Mrs Stokes, 31, delivered the baby herself in the back seat as husband Paul rushed the young family to hospital

The mum-of-three added: 'We were driving through Harston and my husband just kept going because he thought we had a bit of time left.

Engine:                     1.6i

'It was a bit of a shock for him when I leaned forward holding a baby. I wasn't really scared.

'It just happened and adrenaline took over. We'd called ahead to the hospital because it was the middle of the night.

'But I don't think the message got through because when we got there the hospital was all locked up.

'When the midwife came down she wasn't expecting me to be carrying a baby wrapped in a blanket.'

Mum and baby are both doing well and Lyla is now home with big brother Liam, four, and sister Freya, two.

Birth: Lyla May Zafira Stokes was born in the back of a Vauxhall Zafira similar to this

Corin said they gave Lyla a distinctive middle name to mark her bizarre birth.

'We'd already decided on May and Paul wanted to add Zafira after what happened.' she said.

'It'll certainly be a good story to tell her when she's older.'
