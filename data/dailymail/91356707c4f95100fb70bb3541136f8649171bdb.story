On Tuesdays and Fridays, they stay awake, get together and smoke tobacco until dawn in a bid to ward off evil spirits.

These spectacular photos show the people of Bolivia's indigenous Aymara nation, who live in the vast, remote plains of the Altiplano plateau.

The residents, who don elaborate costumes  for an array of daily rituals, live according to 'alien but beautiful' traditions that have flourished for centuries.

These include the worship of Catholic figures alongside traditional spirits, such as Pachamama, 'earth mother', and Supay, 'god of the underworld'.

Theatrical: These include the worship of Catholic figures alongside traditional spirits, such as Pachamama, 'earth mother', and Supay, 'god of the underworld'

Performing a ritual: The Aymara believe that people are more vulnerable to harmful spirits and 'the evil eye' on Tuesdays and Fridays, so must protect themselves

Following tradition: To do this, they must not fall asleep before the next day and instead, gather with their friends to 'converse, discuss together and smoke tobacco'

They believe that ordinary people are more vulnerable to harmful spirits and 'the evil eye' on Tuesdays and Fridays, so must protect themselves.

To do this, they must not fall asleep before the next day and instead, gather with their friends to 'converse, discuss together and smoke tobacco'.

Swiss photographer Raphaël Verona, who captured the striking photos of the Aymara alongside Thomas Rousset, explained: 'Tuesdays and Fridays, sorcerers invoke and liberate harmful forces in this world.

'The air becomes saturated with these cruel designs that become almost palpable. When exhaling the smoke, you send back the air charged with evil spells to the sender.

'You must also constantly pay homage to the spirits. There is a great variety of different spirits, such as Pachamama, Supay and the Virgin Mary.'

The Aymara's rituals often involve offerings of coca leaves, alcohol, cigarettes, threads of dyed wool, sugar and molded figures to the spirits.

Mr Verona, who has recently released a book on the indigenous Aymara nation, Waska Tatay,, spent several months documenting its 'beautiful' culture' in South America.

He told CNN Spanish colonialists were behind the nation's worship of both Catholic deities and traditional spirits,  who are seen as neither wholly good nor wholly bad, and can be powerful allies.

He added that the Aymara 'live with both Catholicism and animism, both in modernity and their ancestral traditions', saying: 'They visit the Yatiri, the priest, to pay homage to deities or give prophesies when they are applying for visas, or for assistance in businesses matters.'

Religious: They also take part in traditional ceremonies, such as Tinku and Oruo, which feature striking outfits. Above, a woman offers another object to the spirits

Goods: These offerings to the Catholic and Aymara spirits include money, nut shells, an ornate gold statue and small models of a house, a bus and a green frog

Striking: Mr Verona the Spanish colonial influence was behind the nation's worship of both Catholic deities and traditional spirits. Above, a woman poses on a tree

Residents: He said the Aymara 'live with both Catholicism and animism, both in modernity and their ancestral traditions', saying: 'They visit the Yatiri, the priest, to pay homage to deities or give prophesies when they are applying for visas, or for assistance in businesses matters'.

And interestingly, he said that residents appear to perceive traditional stories 'as true as the people talking to you at this moment'.

'If you ask someone if Supay, the god of the mines and the underworld, lives, they will say, "of course", because they heard stories about it. So myths come to life very strongly in this society,' he said.

These myths include the story of the evil spirit Kari Kari, who reportedly targets his victims on public transport, before 'taking advantage of moments of sleep or provoking drowsiness to achieve his ends'.

In his book, Mr Verona says of Kari Kari: 'He starts by blowing a powder of human bones over his victim's face that generates unusual dreams.

Strong belief: Interestingly, Mr Verona added that residents appeared to perceive traditional, centuries-old stories 'as true as the people talking to you at this moment'

Daily life: 'Myths come to life very strongly in this society,' said Mr Verona, from Switzerland. Above, an Aymara man is seen dressed in traditional clothing in his home

Strange: The Aymara worship Catholic deities alongside traditional spirits, such as Pachamama and Supay. Above, an unusual decoration is seen in an Aymara home

Natural: This man, who is pictured wearing an elaborate outfit and a mask, is among many Aymara who live according to traditions that have flourished for centuries

'He then makes an incision in his abdomen with a flaked blade - nowadays, people even talk of a syringe - to extract a little bit of fat. 

He continues: 'No one knows why he behaves in such a way.' but adds: 'All of us know someone who has been one of his victims.'
