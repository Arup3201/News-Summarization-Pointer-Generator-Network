West Ham have stepped ahead of Valencia in their efforts to sign Anderlecht's Cheikhou Kouyate.

The 24-year-old can play in defence or midfield and has been pondering offers from both clubs after bids of Â£7million were accepted.

Manager Sam Allardyce was instructed by Hammers co-owners David Gold and David Sullivan to provide more entertainment next season.

As a consequence Teddy Sheringham has returned to Upton Park as an attacking coach, while Argentinian striker Mauro Zarate has arrived on a three-year contract from Velez Sarsfield.

But Allardyce is also keen to shore up his defence in order to push up the Premier League next season.

Manchester City defenders Joleon Lescott and Micah Richards and goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon have also been linked.

On the move: Micah Richards is expected to leave Man City this summer
