Ukip county organiser Paul Lovegrove has served two prison sentences - one for wounding with intent in 1996 and one for actual bodily harm in 2000

Ukip has been plunged into crisis after senior activists and a general election candidate quit over the violent past of a local organiser.

Nigel Farage has given his '100 per cent' backing to county organiser Paul Lovegrove after a storm sparked by his previous convictions for assault.

The row has seen Don Jerrard quit as Ukip candidate in Fareham and sent shockwaves across the party in Hampshire, where Mr Lovegrove is in charge of the election campaign.

Mr Lovegrove has served two prison sentences - one for wounding with intent in 1996 and one for actual bodily harm in 2000, the Portsmouth News reported.

His past has been the subject of heated rows at Ukip meetings, culminating in Mr Jerrard abandoning plans to stand at the election.

Former Portsmouth City Councillor Paul Godier and ex-Fareham and Gosport chairman Bob Ingram have also left the party, blaming Mr Lovegrove's criminal past.

He was jailed for two years when he got into a fight over a family feud and grabbed a bread knife before slashing a man across the face. He served a year behind bars.

He received a number of criminal convictions for drug possession but then went to college in an attempt to turn his life around.

However, he then got into a fight with a man but fled to Spain to avoid a charge of actual bodily harm.

With his partner he had two children on the Costa Del Sol, before returning to England after five years.

He claims he was later beaten up in Guildford, and was charged with an allegation of sexual assault at knifepoint.

He was cleared of this offence at a trial but was jailed for 12 months for the earlier actual bodily harm charge.

However, Mr Farage is standing by Mr Lovegrove, insisting 'people deserve a second chance in life'.

He told the newspaper: 'Mr Lovegrove may have fallen off the rails earlier in his life but he is now totally reformed and we are standing by him 100 per cent. We knew about his past.

'With any political party, having people from all walks of life is a bonus. After all you can't have every party full of Oxbridge graduates.'

Mr Farage added: 'You get divisions in all political parties but it does not affect what we stand for and we stand for the normal working class person. We are more united, focused and more able to get on with the job.'

Ukip had its eye on the Fareham seat after former minister Mark Hoban announced he would not be standing as the Tory candidate.

But the campaign has been thrown into down by Mr Jerrard's resignation. He said that 'no decent person would have anything to do with' Mr Lovegrove.

'I won't have anything to do with them. It is a shambles. They are in turmoil because they don't know what to do. They have not spoken to the people on the ground, the people that have made these complaints.

'It is a clear case of being in a hole and them digging as fast as they can and it's obvious they have something to hide.

'They are a total shambles, all of their own making.'

Mr Lovegrove says he never hid his criminal convictions after becoming county organiser on January 12.

He said: 'Honesty gets you a long way. People don't like it. They find it scary.

'I am everything they despise as I can talk from experience. I have lived through all of these things. Who can represent us? It's got to be one of us.

'It is a shame they are trying to drag someone down who is a real son of this city. Ukip have put their money where their mouth is by supporting me.

'I am a product of this country they claim to govern so well.

'I have learnt from my mistakes - they happened 10 and 20 years ago and if we have never made any mistakes to learn by then how can we lead?

'I have had the pleasure and pain of life experiences which I hope to pass on through politics.

'I was born with a plastic spoon in my mouth, like most people. The people in politics come from a different world. They don't have any idea.'
