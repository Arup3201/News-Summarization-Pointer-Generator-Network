Lawyers have pledged to stage a second strike to undermine the Government’s legal aid shake-up after Justice Secretary Chris Grayling published a final raft of reforms.

Members of the Criminal Bar Association will bring the court system to a halt when they take part in a nationwide walkout next Friday in protest at the cuts.

They insist the reductions in fees paid by the taxpayer will stop bright legal brains becoming criminal lawyers. Some junior barristers earn as little as £13,000 a year, their leaders said.

Lawyers have pledged to stage a second strike to undermine the Government¿s legal aid shake-up after Justice Secretary Chris Grayling published a final raft of reforms

Lawyers on strike outside the Old Bailey last month were branded the most elite picket line in the history of British industrial relations.

Their cause was undermined after one young barrister was pictured clutching a £1,100 Mulberry handbag, though she later claimed it had been a gift from her mother.

Legal hackles are up because the Ministry of Justice is slashing £215million from the annual £2.1billion legal aid bill. The cuts target the fees paid to barristers defending criminals.

Among the most contentious proposals is a 17 per cent cut in litigators’ fees to be phased in from next month.

Yesterday barristers lashed out at the Government for pressing ahead with ‘significant’ legal aid cuts.

Nicholas Lavender, chairman of the Bar Council, which represents barristers in England and Wales, said: ‘We are bitterly disappointed that, despite a sustained campaign emphasising that these proposals are contrary to the public interest, the Government is pressing ahead with significant cuts to legal aid for advocacy in the Crown Court.

‘These cuts are financially unnecessary, will cause significant damage to the justice system and to our international reputation for upholding the rule of law, and will drive skilled and experienced advocates away from publicly-funded criminal work.’

Alongside plans to cut legal aid fees, Mr Grayling announced measures aimed at supporting lawyers through the period of transition.

They include plans to overhaul fees paid to defence lawyers so they no longer lose out when a case heard in the Crown Court, which could have been heard in the magistrates’ court, is dropped by the prosecution.

Mr Grayling also announced plans to bring in interim payments to help with lawyers’ cash flow in long trials.

He said: ‘This Government is dealing with an unprecedented financial challenge and I have no choice but to look for the savings I have to make across the full range of the Ministry of Justice’s work.

‘I cannot exempt legal aid from this but that doesn’t mean I don’t understand how challenging these reductions will be.’

Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said: ‘Legal aid is a lifeline to many of the most vulnerable in our society. A civilised society needs a system of legal aid to ensure access to justice for everyone.’
