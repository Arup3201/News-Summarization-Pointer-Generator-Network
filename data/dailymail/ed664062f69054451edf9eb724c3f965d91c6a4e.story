Incredible footage of a mass pile-up, involving around 40 cars on a snow-covered highway, has been released - and miraculously, no one died.

The crashes occurred on Highway 41/45 near Germantown, Wisconsin on Sunday and continued for around five minutes.

Several cars skidded off the road onto a grass verge, while many others crashed as they sped towards the carnage, unable to stop fast enough in the wintry conditions.

The mass pile-up, involving around 40 cars, happened on a snow-covered highway in Wisconsin on Sunday

The crashes occurred on Highway 41/45 near Germantown and continued for around five minutes. People stood on the road, despite police warnings not to do so

Twelve people were injured, according to police, but miraculously there were no fatalities

Twelve people were injured, according to Germantown police, who said they were amazed by the number of motorists who remained standing on the road.

Officer Tim Miller, who was en route to another crash, said: 'If people watch Nascar, and they watch the Daytona 500 or Talledega, where they wait for what’s called the Big Crash, where all the cars crash because they’re all so close together, that’s what this was like - only there was nobody there to stop it with a yellow flag and slow all the other cars down.

'It just kept going and going and going. I mean that’s what was helpless about it,' he told the Inquisitr.

Up to half the motorists fled the scene, while others just stood around on the highway despite being cautioned not to do so.

Officer Tim Miller said the crashes just kept 'going and going and going'

Captain Mike Snow, of the Germantown police, said: 'Stay in your vehicle, and certainly, keep your seatbelt fastened.

'Make sure everybody in the vehicle has their seatbelt fastened.'

'Only after members of law enforcement have secured the scene, and permitted you to exit, should you leave your vehicle,' he told Fox 11.

The video was released by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation.

Further down the highway, a 67-year-old man was killed in a pile-up involving 40 cars.

Emergency personnel respond to an accident on southbound Interstate 43 in Mequon, Wisconsin on Sunday

A powerful storm that crept across the country dropped snow, freezing rain and sleet on the Mid-Atlantic region and headed northeast on Sunday.

The storm forced the cancellation of thousands of flights across the U.S. and slowed traffic on roads, leading to a number of accidents, including a fatal crash on the Pennsylvania Turnpike near Morgantown that led to a series of fender-benders involving 50 cars that stranded some motorists for up to seven hours.

More than two dozen vehicles were involved in another series of crashes on nearby Interstate 78.

And early this month, 30 people were injured when an icy bridge caused a massive pile-up of 70 cars, two tractor-trailers and one box trailer in Worcester, Massachusetts.
