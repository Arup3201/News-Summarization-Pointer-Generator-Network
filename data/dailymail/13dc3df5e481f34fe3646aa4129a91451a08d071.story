It was once a field of dreams but Michigan’s Pontiac Silverdome is now somewhat of a nightmarish vision.

Matt Ervin flew a drone of the stadium to capture haunting images of its crumbling interiors. 

Only patches of turf remain on the pitch and remnants from the tumbled down roof lay scattered everywhere. Although there's room for more than 80,311 people and 12,000 cars, the empty parking lot has a graveyard-like feel with cracks running through the tarmac.

The sports venue - which sits on a 127 acre plot - cost $55.7 million to build back in the early Seventies. It has been closed for almost three years now and developers are yet to announce what the future plans will be.

Neglected: Triple Investment Properties bought the Silverdome in 2009 for $583,000, but plans to turn it into a soccer stadium never happened

Disrepair: Last month the final sections of the Silverdome's Teflon-covered roof dropped to the field

Flashback: In its heyday the Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan, hosted the Super Bowl, a pope, the NBA finals, Led Zeppelin, Elvis, WrestleMania and dozens of other world-class acts and sporting events 

Ervin, who captured the Silverdome looking in a sorry state, said: 'Sad to see this stadium in this condition . . . it really needs to go now.'  

In its heyday the arena hosted the Super Bowl, a pope, the NBA finals, Led Zeppelin, Elvis, WrestleMania and dozens of other world-class acts and sporting events. Almost 100,000 people would pack into the house.

But that all changed in 2002, when the NFL team moved to Ford Field in Detroit and the Silverdome soon fell into disrepair.

The stadium has had an uncertain fate ever since, as the city tried to find use for it - including monster truck rallies, boxing matches and as a drive-in theater - and the population in Pontiac dwindled.

Triple Investment Properties bought the Silverdome in 2009 for $583,000, but plans to turn it into a soccer stadium never materialized.

'They had a half-a-million-dollar soccer field they bought that was put in there as well as paying for maintenance of $1.5 million a year up until the roof caved in,' said Jim Passeno of RJM Auctioneers, who in June organized a nine day auction that raised about $500,000.

Turf that still featured the Lions' logo from both end zones was auctioned for $1,600 each, while copper wiring proved very popular and raised $500,000.

Now, what once was one of the premier venues in the world is a tattered, empty reminder of the stadium's memorable past - and of the dismal economy in Michigan.

Last fall Michigan's sometimes harsh weather put pay to the final sections of the old stadium's Teflon-covered roof which just dropped to the field.

Carcass: An auction at the stadium in June raised about $500,000 including selling turf that still featured the Lions' logo from both end zones which was auctioned for $1,600 each, while the sale of copper wiring raised $500,000
