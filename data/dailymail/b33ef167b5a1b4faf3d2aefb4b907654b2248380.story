E.T. The Extra Terrestrial from 1982 in which the alien stranded on Earth. The film, directed by Steven Spielberg, won four Oscars: best sound, best score, best sound effects and best visual effects. It was nominated for Best Picture but lost to Gandhi

A nostalgic nation has voted the 1980s the best decade for films with ET the Extra-Terrestrial taking the top spot as the best-loved childhood movie.

According to a survey, Steven Spielberg, who directed and co-produced the 1982 classic, is also the UK’s favourite director.

Action and adventure was the most popular film genre with romance trailing behind comedy and science fiction for preferred viewing.

The poll commissioned to mark the launch of Samsung Smart TV’s S Recommendation technology found that the film people couldn’t get enough of and voted to watch again and again was The Shawshank Redemption.

And the line: 'Frankly my dear, I don’t give a damn' from Gone With The Wind was chosen by one in 10 people as the best film quote.

While tastes may vary, 72% of people chose relaxation and escapism as the reason why they watch movies on average two to four times a month.

If it was easier to find films they liked, 30% of people said they would see more movies and more than a third of people use trial and error to decide what to watch.

E.T. won four Oscars: best sound, best score, best sound effects and best visual effects. It was nominated for ‘Best Picture’ but lost to Gandhi.

Action over romance: the film people couldn't get enough of, according to a survey, and which they voted to watch again and again was The Shawshank Redemption starring Tim Robbins (pictured right) and Morgan Freeman (left).

In school playgrounds across Britain, children imitated the catchphrase ‘ET phone home.’

Unlike many successful films exploited by Hollywood, Spielberg never made a sequel to ET.

While a follow-up script was written -
in which ET’s friend Elliot is kidnapped by evil aliens - Spielberg 
decided against a sequel feeling it would ‘rob the original of its 
virginity’.

One of ET’s biggest fans was the late pop singer Michael Jackson, who cited it as his favourite movie.

The OnePoll survey asked 1,500 people about their favourite films.
