It’s an egg that would make the mother of all omelettes, being more than 100 times the size of a chicken egg.

The giant partly-fossilised egg of an elephant bird is being put up for auction at Christie's and is 30cm high and 21cm in diameter.

The elephant bird, which resembled an 11-foot-tall ostrich, is thought to have been hunted to extinction in Madagascar between the 14th and 17th centuries.

Examples of whole eggs are extremely rare and it is likely to fetch up to £30,000.

More than 260 lots will go under the hammer in the Travel, Science and History sale at Christies, including curiosities of natural history, globes, scientific instruments, rare books and maps, alongside paintings and works of art from the ages of exploration.

Occasionally subfossilised elephant bird eggs are found intact and the National Geographic Society in Washington holds a specimen of an Aepyornis egg which was given to Luis Marden in 1967.

The specimen is intact and contains the skeleton of the unborn bird.

In Denver, the Museum of Nature and Science holds two intact eggs, one of which is currently on display. Another giant Aepyornis egg is on show at the Harvard Museum of Natural History in Cambridge, while a cast of the egg is preserved at the Grant Museum of Zoology at London University.

David
Attenborough owns an almost complete eggshell, dating from 6-700 CE, 
which he pieced together from fragments that were given to him while 
making his 1961 BBC series Zoo Quest to Madagascar.

In March 2011, the BBC aired the 
60-minute documentary Attenborough and the Giant Egg, presented by 
Attenborough, about his personal scientific quest to discover the 
secrets of the elephant bird and its egg.

There is also an intact specimen of 
an elephant bird's egg on display at the Delaware Museum of Natural 
History as well as another in London’s Natural History Museum, London.

The
Melbourne Museum in Australia has two elephant bird eggs. The first was
acquired for £100 by Professor Frederick McCoy in June 1862, and is an 
intact example.

In 1950 it was subjected to radiological examination, although disappointingly it revealed no traces of embryonic material.

It is widely believed that the 
extinction of Aepyornis was a result of human activity. The birds were 
initially widespread, occurring from the northern to the southern tip of
Madagascar.

One theory states that humans hunted 
the elephant birds to extinction in a very short time for such a large 
landmass (the blitzkrieg hypothesis). There is indeed evidence that they
were hunted and their preferred habitats destroyed.

Their eggs may have been particularly vulnerable. A recent archaeological study found remains of eggshells among the remains of human fires, suggesting that the eggs regularly provided meals for entire families.

Elephant birds are an extinct family of flightless birds found only on the island of Madagascar and comprising the genera Aepyornis and Mullerornis.

They are among the heaviest known birds (Dromornis stirtoni of Australia reached a similar weight). The reasons for and timings of their extinctions remain unclear, although there are written accounts of elephant bird sightings on the island in the 17th century.

The famous explorer and traveller Marco Polo mentions very large birds in his accounts of his journeys to the East during the 12th–13th centuries.

These earlier accounts are today believed to describe elephant birds.

Aepyornis was at the time the world's largest bird, believed to have been more than 3 m (10 ft) tall and weighing close to 400 kg (880 lb).

The egg volume can be up to 160 times greater than a chicken egg.
