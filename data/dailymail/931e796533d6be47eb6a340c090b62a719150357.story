A disgraced darts star drove his estranged wife to the brink of suicide after he repeatedly harassed her, a court heard today.

Chris Mason, known by fans as 'Mace the Ace', admitted breaching a non-molestation order which banned him from contacting his wife of 14-years Lorna.

The former darts champion has previously been hauled before the courts after pleading guilty to assaulting Lorna, 39, and threatening to slit her throat.

He admitted breaching the order when he emailed Lorna three times in a month over a dispute about an insurance claim.

Mason was handed a restraining order banning him from having any contact with Lorna - unless through his solicitors - until April 2016.

Wolverhampton Magistrates' Court heard since he attacked her in October last year Lorna had suffered with depression and was suicidal.

Prosecutor Jayne Youngs said: 'They are going through a divorce which he is making life difficult and the process has made her ill and she has had a nervous breakdown and is on depression medication.

'She does not think she is coping and says if it carries on like this she will have another breakdown. If it wasn’t for her daughter she would end her life because of this defendant.

'The three emails sent were not received until later on due to her internet being down and they were to do with insurance.

'She has made a statement where she 
says she was with her husband for 14 years and several of them she 
suffered domestic violence and on one occasion he was arrested.

'On
 October 10 she was issued a non-molestation order at the family court. 
He was not to contact her except through their solicitors.

'She says she does not feel comfortable with him contacting her and no matter what she does he will find a way to contact her.'

As well as the restraining order Mason was also ordered to pay £85 costs and a £60 victim surcharge. He was also told to carry out 50 hours unpaid work.

The court heard Mason, from Hednesford, Staffordshire, breached the order by contacting Lorna three times between February and March this year.

Chairwoman of the bench Catherine Hazenberg told him: 'We accept you were frustrated but you have breached the order three times.

'We will impose a restraining order on top of the non-molestation order and we want to make it certain you do not contact Lorna Mason in any way, shape or form, except through solicitors, it is your responsibility.

'This will be for a period of two years to protect Lorna Mason.'

The court heard Mason contacted Lorna after he received an insurance claim relating to a car which they owned before he walked out on her in 2007.

Richard Quinn, defending, said: 'My client has no issues with his relationship breaking down. When it did, he left the marital home and everything in it, including a motor vehicle to her (Lorna Mason).

'It is alleged that she has formed a relationship with another gentleman and that vehicle was involved in a road traffic accident.

'It is alleged the driver of that vehicle was the male that the complainant is with and was guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol.

'An insurance claim, which is suspected to be fraudulent, was then made, I can’t say any more than that, but as the owner of the vehicle, my client was contacted by an insurance company daily to find out who the driver was.

Chris Mason began his career in the British Darts Organisation making his World Championship debut in 1996. He lost 0–3 to Andy Fordham.

After a brief stint in the World Darts Council in 1996, he enjoyed his best achievement in the 1999 World Championship to reach the semi-final.

Mason's last appearance at Lakeside was a first round defeat to Mervyn King in 2001.

In 2002, he decided to switch from the BDO to the Professional Darts Corporation in time to play at the PDC World Championships again in 2002, but he lost in the first round to Dave Askew.

He took time out from the game to deal with his personal issues and his enforced absence caused him to miss most tournaments in 2003 and 2004 - but he returned to play in the 2004 World Grand Prix in October and reached the quarter-finals.

'After not being able to find out, purely out of frustration he e-mailed the claimant on three separate occasions in a non-threatening way to try and resolve the matter, although she failed to respond and that, ultimately was that.

'He has complied in the past and has been sober for six months and three weeks now, he is turning his life around.'

Mason, of Hednesford, Staffordshire, was on the brink of stardom when he won the prestigious Scottish Open in 1995, Irish Masters in 2000 and English Open in 2001.

But his life began to unravel after he reached the quarter-finals of the PDC World Championships in 2003.

In 2003 Mason was jailed for three years after he attacked a father-of-two with a hammer after a row about a dog.

He also caused a stir when he tried to fight darts rival Phil 'The Power' Taylor after a bust-up at a World Championship match in 2007.

In the same year he was poised to appear on Celebrity Big Brother but pulled out at the last minute.

In June 2010 he was exposed as a benefits cheat when he admitted failing to declare £45,000 of winnings while claiming housing and council tax benefit in Stoke-on-Trent.

He retired from the sport in 2011 and now regularly appears as a darts pundit on ITV.
