A social housing resident has been booted out of his home over his litter-strewn and overgrown back garden.

Kevin Kime's backyard had bags full of 'rotting smelly rubbish' and was covered in pieces of plastic sheeting and broken fencing. His lawn was also overrun with brambles while a broken basketball hoop had been propped up against the against a fence and an old table and chairs were almost hidden underneath the pile of black bags.

The 47-year-old had been warned two years ago to clean up his overgrown plot but social housing bosses lost patience after making a surprise inspection.

Kevin Kime has been kicked out of his home for having this overgrown and untidy garden 

Nottingham City Homes (NCH), which runs council housing in the city, booted Kime out of his semi-detached house in Romilay Close, Beeston, two weeks ago.

The eviction was the first in the city for over seven years and the social housing group had to get in professional cleaners to clear the garden and wash the interior.

NCH had successfully applied to Nottingham County Court for an Outright Possession Order against Kime, claiming he had persistently breached his tenancy agreement which states residents must 'make sure their gardens are maintained, tidy and free of rubbish'.

Gill Moy, director of housing at NCH, said: 'Our tenancy agreement is very clear that the customers are responsible for maintaining their gardens.

'Mr Kime's failure to act left the judge with no option but to conclude that it was unlikely there would be any improvement in the condition of the garden, so he granted us an outright possession order to evict Mr Kime from his home.'

Residents on the well-maintained Lenton Abbey estate yesterday expressed their relief Kime had been given his marching orders.

The 47 year-old was warned two years ago to clean up his act but when inspectors from Nottingham City Homes conducted a surprise visit, they found the garden in a state

Neighbour Jeremy Phillips, 43, said: 'It was horrible to live next to. 'At first glance it was just brambles but if you looked closer you could see that there was furniture buried under bags of rotting, smelly rubbish.

'I can't imagine how they lived in there. If the outside looked like that and they were dumping rubbish out I wonder how jammed full the inside must have been.'

Emma Turner, 23, who lives three doors down from the property, added: 'You didn't really see him much, I can't imagine they would have shown their face often to us knowing the state of that garden.

'It was an eyesore, I just hope someone will be brought in who looks after it better.

'Maybe they need some help now, if they had a warning two years ago and still couldn't help themselves you wonder if there's a bigger issue.' 

Michael Edwards, 22, who rents a bedroom in a nearby house, said: 'That can't have been nice to live next to.

'I know for most people looking after a garden isn't a top priority, but that's just ridiculous.'

And shop worker David Winchester, 27, added: 'That does look out of order, but I don't know if kicking someone out of their home for that is a bit extreme.'

Neighbours have expressed their relief at Kime's eviction who had let his garden become overgrown and litter strewn

The garden has now been restored after a team of cleaners cleared the rubbish and cut back the overgrown brambles and hedges.

Local councillor Sam Webster said: 'Gardens that are left completely neglected have an impact on other residents and bring down the area. From time to time we get feedback from residents in Lenton Abbey and they ask for more robust action in serious cases.'

One neighbour on Romilay Court said: 'I noticed it didn't look great when I cut part of the hedge down but it didn't smell or anything like that.'

And another resident added: 'You didn't notice the problem because of the high hedges but these pictures do look pretty bad.' 

NCH had served Mr Kime an injunction in December 2012 compelling him to clean up the garden but when he failed to do so the county court issued an Outright Possession Order.

A spokesman said: 'Despite assurances to NCH officers that he would make improvements by required deadlines, he did not stick to these timescales or made little or no improvement to his garden.

'The agreement all tenants sign up to states that they agree to be responsible for making sure their gardens, yards and hedges are maintained, tidy and free of rubbish at all times.

'This includes grass, plants, bushes, hedges and trees.'
