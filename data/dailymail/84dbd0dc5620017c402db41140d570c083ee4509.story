Eating an apple a day does not actually keep the doctor away - but it might stop you going to your pharmacist.

Researchers looked at data on 8,399 US adults and initially found evidence to support the proverb.

They discovered that those who had one small apple a day had a nine per cent lower chance of visiting the doctor several times a year.

However when they adjusted their statistics for other factors, their conclusions changed.

The University of Michigan researchers adjusted for ways that ‘apple eaters might be very different from everyone else,’ such as how they were less likely to smoke and be more educated.

Eating an apple a day does not actually keep the doctor away - but it might stop you going to your pharmacist. Apple eaters were less likely to use prescription medicines, researchers found

Considering those factors, the study found that people who eat an apple a day were just as likely as everyone else to go to doctors.

They were also just as likely to stay overnight in a hospital or visit a mental health professional.

Apple eaters were, however, less likely to use prescription medication.

Of the 8,399 adults who took part in the study 753, or nine per cent, ate an apple a day while 7,646, or 91 per cent, did not.

Lead author Matthew Davis, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan's school of nursing, said: ‘Our findings suggest that the promotion of apple consumption may have limited benefit in reducing national health care spending.

‘In the age of evidence-based assertions, however, there may be merit to saying: ‘An apple a day keeps the pharmacist away.'’

Apples have long been known to promote good health and contain vitamin C, which aids the immune system.

They also reduce tooth decay by cleaning the teeth and may even protect your brain cells from conditions like Alzheimer’s.

The proverb about eating an apple a day can be traced back to Pembrokeshire in the 1860s where it was said by locals.

Apple eaters were less likely to use prescription medicines, less likely to smoke and more educated than non-apple eaters, researchers found

The original version is said to be: ‘Eat an apple on going to bed, and you’ll keep the doctor from earning his bread’.

Over the years it became: ‘An apple a day, no doctor to pay’ and: ‘An apple a days sends the doctor away’.

The modern use of the phrase was first recorded in 1922.

Wendy Brannen, director of public relations for the US Apple Association, said that the research should not put people off eating apples.

She said: ‘While we appreciate the University of Michigan (a top apple-growing state, by the way) took the time to put the "apple a day" adage to the test, it's foolish to even imply you shouldn't enjoy a daily apple for your health when centuries of advice and stacks of current research would imply otherwise.’
