A serial rapist broke into a celebratory dance after he was released from a West Australian prison, despite a judge saying he was at high risk of re-offending.

Patrick Alfred Dennis Comeagain is now a free man and could not contain his joy while pushing a trolley of his belongings through the automatic doors of Casuarina Prison with a smile plastered across his face.

On Thursday, Justice Ralph Simmons approved the 41-year-old's released into the community, but imposed a strict 10-year supervision order on the man - requiring him to wear a GPS tracker, comply to a strict curfew and not to have contact with a child under the age of 16.

Patrick Alfred Dennis Comeagain has spent 14 years in prison, including time for raping a nine-year-old girl and two women

Comeagain has spent 14 years - most of his adult life - in prison and claims to have sexually assaulted 41 people, including men, women and children. He spent six of those years as a declared sex offender after the introduction of the Western Australia's tough sex offender laws.

Nine News reported he was convicted of sexually assaulting a nine-year-old girl in 1994. He raped a woman five weeks after being released on parole and 37 days after that he raped another woman in her home.

Justice Simmons imposed 43 conditions on Comeagain and said although there was a risk of re-offending, he wished the 41-year-old well.

Comeagain thanked Justice Simmons and said he would make the most of the opportunity.

Western Australia Police Minister Liza Harvey said she strongly disagreed with Comeagain's release.

'The court has decided to do this, but the DDP [Director of Public Prosecutions] opposed it, police oppose it,' she told Nine News.

'We are bound by the decision of the court.

'I can only imagine [his victims'] horror in seeing this person released. I share it.'

Comeagain was raised in the Mullewa and Geraldton regions of Western Australia.

Comeagain has had five episodes of serious sexual offending, starting in 1987 when he was 15.

He has also committed offences of a non-sexual nature.

Previous annual reviews of his dangerous sex offender status, it has been noted there had been very few occasions following his release from prison when Comeagain had not re-offended shortly after.
