The former head of transportation 
security says a new policy that allows small knives on commercial planes
doesn't go far enough, and should include weapons such as 'battle axes'
and 'machetes.'

Kip Hawley, the former chief of the 
Transportation Security Administration, said anything that wouldn't be 
able to harm an aircraft's functionality should be allowed on board.

'In retrospect, I should have done 
the same thing,' Hawley told CNN of the rule, which has caused widespread 
confusion and outrage, especially among the families of
victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

Kip Hawley, the former chief of TSA, says a new policy that allows small knives on commercial planes doesn't go far enough, and should include weapons such as 'battle axes' and 'machetes'

New rules: Flight attendants are balking at the new changes that will lift a number of prohibited items and allow travelers to carry on small knives on board

Remaining restrictions: TSA officials hope that by keeping some banned it will instill less fear in flyers

'They ought to let everything on that
is sharp and pointy,' Hawley said. 'Battle axes, machetes ... bring 
anything you want that is pointy and sharp because while you may be able
to commit an act of violence, you will not be able to take over the 
plane. It is as simple as that.'

Hawley added, 'So my position would 
be, bravo on the 2.6 inch knife. But why not take it all the way and 
then really clean up the checkpoint where officers are focusing on bombs
and toxins, which are things that can destroy an airplane. And it would
smooth the process, cost less money, and be better security.'

The TSA's announcement of the new policy has upset many families who lost loved ones in the 9/11 terror attacks.

'I'm really horrified and I would say
the majority of 9/11 family members are really shocked by it,' said 
Sally Regenhard, the mother of firefighter Christian Regenhard who died 
trying to save people in the World Trade Center.

The TSA said effective April 25, it 
would allow small knives with blades that are 2.36 inches or less in 
length and less than 1/2 inch wide.

Explaining why axes and machetes 
wouldn't do harm on an airplane, Hawley said, 'What are you going to do 
when you get on board with a battle ax? Are you pull out your battle ax 
and say, "I'm taking over the airplane?" You may be able to cut one or 
two people, but pretty soon you would be down in the aisle and the 
battle ax would be used on you.'

He added, 'You can commit acts of violence on an aircraft with what is allowed now. With a Coke can, a key, a ruler, and some duct tape, you can make a 12-inch razor-sharp sword. And every eighth-grader would be able to do that.'

Ms Regenhard told MailOnline about a recent flight she took to Los Angeles where the security screener stopped her because she had a small container of yogurt onto a flight.

'Yogurt's more dangerous than a pen knife and a golf club!' she said.

'I am vehemently against anyone bringing a pen knife. I don't think there is another 9/11 family who doesn't get on a plane with a lot of trepidation and fear.

'I always think of 9/11. I always think "Is there someone on here who is going to be here who is going to be a terrorist?"'

Another relative, Debra Burlingame, says small pocketknives can be just as lethal as the box cutters that are still banned.

Ms Burlingame's brother was the pilot of the hijacked plane that crashed into the Pentagon on September 11, 2001. The hijackers wielded box cutters.

The families of victims are not the only ones who are upset: the former colleagues of victims are as well.

Specific: The TSA says that the changes reflect the findings of their recent review of security measures

Exemptions: Only certain bats are allowed but many think it is premature to allow any at all

The Association of Professional 
Flight attendants 'categorically rejects a proposal to allow knives of 
any kind in the cabin,' and they don't understand why 'such a momentous 
decision' was made without any consultation.

As
for some of the larger items that they will now allow, like the sports 
equipment, increases 'the potential for passengers getting hit with 
these items during boarding and deplaning. It's a recipe for disaster,' 
said the APFA representative.

'This is part of an overall Risk-Based
Security approach, which allows Transportation Security officers to 
better focus their efforts on finding higher-threat items such as 
explosives,' he said.

Hawley said he understands and respects their opposition, 'but from a security strategy point of view this is absolutely the right decision.'

'The air marshals and the flight attendants have legitimate concerns, certainly, for their own safety, but the threat of taking over a plane with a small, sharp instrument is zero,' Hawley said. 'You cannot necessarily prevent violence on an airplane, but that is not the TSA's mission. TSA's mission is to prevent a successful, catastrophic terrorist attack, and you cannot get a successful, catastrophic terrorist attack with a small knife or a Wiffle ball bat.'

Travelers will now be allowed to bring 
golf clubs, ski poles and even small knives on planes with them since 
aviation officials have announced significant security changes.

Other items that will be allowed on 
board again as part of a passenger's carry-on luggage include billiard 
cues, ski poles, hockey sticks and lacrosse sticks.

Items that had been prohibited like razors, box cutters or knives with a fixed blade are still not allowed on board.

The restrictions about liquids are 
still in place as well, meaning that anything under 3-ounces must be 
declared at the security checkpoint.

Loosening the reins: TSA officials have changed their stance on certain banned objects which will now be allowed on planes starting on April 25

No longer a threat? Billiard cues and lacrosse sticks will be allowed on board now

The 
Flight Attendants Union Coalition, which represents nearly 90,000 flight
attendants from carriers across the country, called the decision a 
'poor and shortsighted decision' by the TSA.

'As the last line of defense in the cabin
and key aviation partners, we believe that these proposed changes will 
further endanger the lives of all flight attendants and the passengers 
we work so hard to keep safe and secure,' the coalition said in a 
statement.

TSA spokesman David Castelveter said the
decision was made to bring U.S. regulations more in line with 
International Civil Aviation Organization standards and would also help 
provide a better experience for travelers.

Castelveter said the TSA has implemented a
number of safety measures including reinforced cockpit doors, allowing 
some pilots to be armed and federal air marshals on board airplanes. He 
said those measures would help ensure safety of the passengers and crew.
