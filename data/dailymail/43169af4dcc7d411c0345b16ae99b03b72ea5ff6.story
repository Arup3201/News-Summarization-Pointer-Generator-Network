In one corner, the mouthy puncher. In the other, the educated boxer.

After three years of petty squabbling, cheap insults and idle threats, a line will finally be drawn under one of British boxing's most bitter of rivalries.

When first Nathan Cleverly and then Tony Bellew clamber through the ropes, both men will finally be free to do what they crave most: hurt each other.

Nathan Cleverly and Tony Bellew continued their hostilities at the weigh-in on Friday afternoon

Opinion remains split down the middle as to which will conquer. Repeat or revenge?

This is the classic clash of the hard-hitting puncher against the skilled boxer.

While the waters will be muddied when the inevitable red mist descends, Bellew's only chance of victory is surely the knockout. One he intends to be brutal.

He says: 'I hope I don't put him out with one shot. I want it to be painful. After he's fought me he's not going to want to box any more.'

Bellew, apparently rejuvenated at cruiserweight, has shown glimpses of why he was branded the 'Bomber' as an amateur with two stoppage victories this year.

Cleverly received a hostile reception in Liverpool but remained focused at the weigh-in on Friday

Although Cleverly has followed suit, his foes were of a lower calibre. Indeed, as a world champion, he stopped just two of his six challengers. And in the first meeting in 2011 – a fight, incidentally that history has made much closer than the reality – it was Cleverly who out-boxed the more crude Bellew.

And the Welshman says: 'A lot of people have him as the favourite because he’s the naturally bigger guy.

'I feel comfortable, strong, sharp and fit. I’ll beat this guy. I’ll bring the speed, I’ll bring the stamina. He can bring his power – I’ve already tested it and I’ve taken it with ease. Has he become this King Kong puncher overnight?'

Both men stand at a crossroads but each is made from different fibres.

Bellew is a fighting man and knows little else; he insists he would fight for free.

Cleverly, who won three major titles while studying maths at university, is less limited.

The question mark hanging over him is his mentality.

Does he have the heart for another war after being broken down piece by piece against Sergey Kovalev 15 months ago?

Bellew insists not.

He says: 'He will say anything to convince himself at this moment in time. He's probably telling himself he's going to knock me out, he's going to do this and that, but reality is striking home with him and it's striking home very quickly.'

Cleverly is dismissive.

Bellew soaked up the atmosphere before he hit the scales in front of the local Liverpool crowd

The Liverpool crowd was orchestrated by Bellew who clearly relished the limelight in his hometown

He says: 'I've got such a good academic brain and I could have a comfortable life outside boxing. I could turn my hand to many other things but its boxing I've decided to do and to stick to because I've worked too hard to just throw in the towel; I've come too far.

'I'm on the verge of big things again so to throw it away at this stage would be a real shame and something I could never forgive so for me its about giving it another crack and going to get another world title. That's my goal and that's what I've set out to do.'

These men pride themselves on being different but in reality share more than they care to admit.

Neither can afford defeat. Both have changed trainer following heavy defeats. Both are almost two stone heavier than three years prior.

But only one will achieve closure in front of a sold-out Echo Arena crowd.

The puncher or the boxer? I predict the latter, a repeat performance from Cleverly. And heartbreak for Bellew.
