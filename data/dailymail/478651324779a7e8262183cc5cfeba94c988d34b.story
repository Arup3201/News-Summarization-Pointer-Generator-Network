From the construction of its fragile bone structure, to the development of individual organs and the sprouting of feathers - this video may make you think twice about eating quail eggs.

A doctor from Lisbon created the time-lapse movie of a developing quail embryo using more than 1,000 separate images taken using a microscope.

It has now been awarded first place in the third annual Nikon Instruments Small World in Motion photomicrography competition.

A doctor from Lisbon has created a time-lapse movie, pictured, of a developing quail embryo using more than 1,000 
separate images taken using a microscope. It has now been awarded first place in the third annual Nikon Instruments Small World in Motion photomicrography competition

The Nikon International Small World 
Competition launched in 1975 to celebrate photographers who use a light 
microscope, also known as photomicrographers.

In 2011, Nikon announced it would start accepting movies taken through the microscope as a new category.

This category, called Small World in Motion accepts any video or digital time-lapse photography taken through the microscope.

Photographers
 can use any type of light microscopy technique, including phase 
contrast, polarised light, fluorescence, interference contrast, 
darkfield, confocal, deconvolution, and mixed techniques, as well as 
record any subject matter.

The winning embryo video was made by Dr. Gabriel G. Martins of The Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia and CBA in Lisbon.

His 3D reconstruction of the embryo includes ‘virtual’ slices taken during 10 days of in-egg gestation.

Michael Weber of The Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics in Germany won second place with his video showing the beating heart of a two-day old zebrafish embryo. 

Michael Weber of The Max Planck Institute
 of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics in Germany won second place with
 his video showing the beating heart of a two-day old zebrafish embryo, pictured. The heart is only 250 micrometres big, or just slightly larger than the diameter of a human hair

It was reconstructed in 3D after being captured using light sheet fluorescence microscopy in the living zebrafish.

The heart is only 250 micrometres big, or just slightly larger than the diameter of a human hair.

In one shot, viewers can see the movement of blood cells through the heart and its adjacent vessels.

Third place went to Dr. Lin Shao of 
the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Janelia Farm Research Campus for 
his video of a live HeLa, or cancer, cell.

It
 shows, for the first time, the inner details of the mitochondria in a 
living cell within a 3D image and was created using 50 time points.

‘Once again, Nikon received an incredible number of entries for Small World in Motion, but this year’s crop of winners showcase truly incredible and ground-breaking techniques that push the boundaries of imaging,’ said Eric Flem, communications and CRM manager, for Nikon Instruments.

‘These videos embrace the very spirit of this competition, which aims to remind us all that cutting-edge science and imaging are not only happening every day, but can be artistically intriguing as well.’

Nikon Small World in Motion awarded three winners with a first, second, and third place prize, and will award an additional 10 entries with honourable mentions throughout 2014.

The judges were science educator and journalist Cara Santa Maria and Michael W. Davidson, Director of the Optical and Magneto-Optical Imaging Center at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory at Florida State University.

First place: Dr. Gabriel G. Martins of The Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia and CBA in Lisbon

Second place: Michael Weber of The Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics in Germany 

Third place: Dr. Lin Shao of
