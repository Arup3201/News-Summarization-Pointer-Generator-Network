Brazil came from behind to see off France in a friendly at the Stade de France, with goals from Oscar, Neymar, and Luis Gustavo.

France had taken the lead through a Raphael Varane header, and looked to be in total control before Chelsea star Oscar's well-worked equaliser, but the visitors fought back strongly in the second half, and could have scored more as the game wore on.

Barcelona's Neymar who already had 42 goals for his country before this game, made it 43, firing past Steve Mandanda from an angle which will have disappointed the French keeper, before Wolfsburg defensive midfielder Luis Gustavo was given the run of the penalty area to head home from a corner.

France, on the other hand, threatened most from set pieces, and Karim Benzema, Moussa Sissoko and Varane could easily have added further goals for the hosts, as Brazil looked panicky whenever a decent cross arrived in their box.   

As tends to be the way with such friendlies, there was no great intensity to the play, but, in flashes there was real quality, and Oscar's equaliser epitomised that.

The Chelsea man, operating from the left, played a lovely one-two with Roberto Firmino before arriving fractions ahead of a defender to poke past Mandanda. 

You might say it was a goal worthy of a World Cup final, but, 17 years after these two sides contested one on the same ground, it had to make do with turning the tide in a friendly.

France had actually started the brighter, and should have been ahead after just eight minutes, Karim Benzema denied by a brilliant save from Jefferson, but he really should have scored his header from three yards.

Brazil, with Manchester United target Firmino playing up front alongside talismanic captain Neymar, failed to find their best play early on, limited for the most part to long shots. 

Firmino in particular was keen to get a strike away from range, but while he twice worked Mandanda with powerful drives, neither could seriously have been said to overstretch the Marseille stopper.

Indeed, while Mandanda made several flashy saves throughout the game, denying Luis Gustavo, Willian and Oscar in the second half, he was rarely able to stop efforts that came from within his side's eighteen-yard box.

Neymar, oscillating between the subtle touches we are used to seeing from him and a clear inability to cope with the slippery surface, should really have been the first to fire past the France keeper, after Oscar had capitalised on a mistake from Morgan Schneiderlin, but having squared up Varane, his shot lacked power and direction.

Just moments later he was punished for his wastefulness, with Varane powering home a header that sparked comparison's to Zinedine Zidane's goal in the 1998 final. 

In truth it owed much to Patrice Evra blocking off defenders, and the majority of the Brazilians standing still as Mathieu Valbuena's corner came over, but the Real Madrid centre back still did well to direct his header into the far corner. 

But France were never able to fully capitalise on Brazilian frailties again, Varane failing to poke home after a free kick, and Benzema blazing over the bar. Debutant Nabil Fekir came closest from open play after coming off the bench, but sent his shot just wide.

As the almost obligatory substitutions poured off the bench the game lost momentum, but for Dunga, there were real signs of encouragement. Brazil were always dangerous on the counter attack, with Willian a particular danger, and, set pieces aside, they looked solid defensively.

This was not the free flowing football that Brazilian sides are famed for, but, for the second time under Dunga, Brazil look tough to beat.
