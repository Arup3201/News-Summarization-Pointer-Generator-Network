With a heartfelt message of pride written across the back of his jacket and a huge grin on his face, this is the emotional moment that four-year-old James Gray-McNicol greeted his soldier father as he took part in a homecoming parade.

James had not seen Private Lee McNicol for six months before he safely returned from Afghanistan in March but waited until his father's regiment enjoyed a hero's welcome yesterday to show him just how proud he is. 

Hundreds of people turned out for the final homecoming parade of the 1st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland through Dumfries yesterday.

Proud: James Gray McNicol, 4, greets his dad Private Lee McNicol of 1st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland on their last homecoming parade in Dumfries yesterday

James and his mum Angela Gray-McNicol, 28, decided to surprise Lee, 27, by making a hooded top embroidered with the words 'My Dad’s my hero.'

He also borrowed his father’s hat and wore a miniature kilt as he accompanied Angela and his one-year-old brother Daniel to the parade.

The youngster clearly could not contain his excitement at seeing his father as the parade ended, and ran from the crowd to give him a big hug.

Delighted father-of-two Lee said: 'It was absolutely fantastic, especially to see the wee man in his kilt.'

Salute: James was delighted to see his father Lee when he returned from a tour of Afghanistan

Show of support: James, four, had 'My Dad's My Hero' embroidered on his top and the badge of his father's regiment

James's Mother Angela added: 'It was very proud and emotional seeing them.

'James was in a kilt and a hoodie with "My dad’s my hero" on the back, and on the front he had a 1 Scots badge and a picture of him with his dad

'It was a big surprise for Lee. Once the parade had finished, James hadn’t seen his dad then he saw him and ran up to him.

'It tore at my heart strings, it was so emotional. I am so proud. It was very, very hard when Lee was away.'

The battalion returned home in March, but the homecoming parade was postponed in April because of the death of Margaret Thatcher.

Commanding Officer Lt Col Ben Wrench said: 'This is the battalion’s final parade and I am immensely proud of the soldiers.'

Lee is now to take up a role in military transport, but is first owed four weeks’ leave to spend time with his family.
