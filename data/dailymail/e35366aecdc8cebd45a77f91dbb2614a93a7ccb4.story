A six-year-old boy has stunned doctors by taking his first steps - despite battling a brain tumour which left him unlikely to ever walk.

Joshua Humphreys was just two years old when he was diagnosed with a benign tumour that had been growing inside his brain even before he was born.

The tumour delayed his development as a toddler - meaning he hadn’t started learning to walk.

He also suffered from tremors and also had to wear nappies until the age of five.

But Joshua has defied the odds by taking his first few steps with the aid of a walking frame and has even set his sights on completing a 2km charity run this weekend.

His mother Lisa, from Altrincham, Greater Manchester, said: ‘Joshua has dealt with everything so well and is such a brave little boy, he is amazing.

‘The doctors couldn’t promise us that he would ever walk, but ever since he got his walking frame it has allowed him to be so much more independent.

‘He walks like a toddler and is very unsteady on his feet, so it is a real struggle for him, but he is very determined.’

She added:  ‘I couldn’t believe it when he said he wanted to run a marathon - we were just having breakfast one morning and he turned to me and said “mummy, I want to do a marathon”.

‘And it is amazing as it has all been entirely his choice - he decided he wanted to do it and that he wanted to raise money for The Christie Hospital where he receives treatment.

In early 2010 Joshua had surgery to remove the tumour but he then had to have another operation in May 2010 because doctors were worried that they had not managed to remove all of the tumour the first time

‘I did have to let him down gently though and tell him he couldn’t do a marathon, but we sat down together and decided on the Mini Manchester 2km run.

‘He is going to do it all on his own with his frame and said that if he isn’t too tired at the end he wants to cross the finish line without his walker, just holding his dad’s hand.’

Joshua's parents first became concerned when he was two, when they realised he was taking a long time to learn to walk.

Mrs Humphreys and her husband Colin, 37, took him to see countless doctors, but were repeatedly reassured that he would learn in time.

But, unconvinced, they took him to see a neurologist who delivered the heartbreaking news in December 2010 that Joshua had a brain tumour and needed immediate surgery.

In September 2010 Joshua's parents were told his tumour had returned and he had chemotherapy to shrink it

Joshua was rushed into theatre on New Year’s Eve to reduce the fluid on his brain, before undergoing a 12 hour operation a few weeks later to ‘debulk’ the tumour.

He then went under the knife again in May 2010 after surgeons realised they may have missed some of the growth.

Then at a routine check-up in September 2010, the family - who had since welcomed baby girl Phoebe, now three - received heart-breaking news that Joshua’s tumour had returned.

Mrs Humphreys: ‘When Joshua was first diagnosed he was only two, so he didn’t really understand what was going on.

‘It was terrifying when we found out that he had been living with a tumour for so long - I felt like I was to blame in some way for it because it had started during pregnancy.

‘And watching our baby go through chemotherapy was awful. He was extremely ill from it and couldn’t eat at all - he had to be fed through a tube in his tummy.

Joshua is now planning to take part in a sponsored 2km run to raise money for the hospital that treats him

‘He lost all of his hair and looked so pale and fragile. And they had to reduce it after a year as he just couldn’t deal with the dosage.

‘It was a horrible time for us a family.

‘And poor Phoebe was just a new-born baby and was being passed from pillar to post as we were spending so much time in the hospital with Joshua which was really difficult.’

Joshua is now in remission, but has to go back to hospital for scans every six months.

Normally, benign tumours can be treated just with surgery.

However, if they return, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are sometimes used to shrink them.

Joshua is taking part in the Mini Manchester Run on Saturday May 17, and has already raised more than £600 for The Christie Hospital, in Manchester.
