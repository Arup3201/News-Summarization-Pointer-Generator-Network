An adventurous cat has been reunited with her owner after she was found two months after going missing - almost 500 miles from home.

Mystery surrounds how Gypsy found her way from her home in Portsmouth, Hampshire, all the way up to Motherwell in Scotland.

But her relived owner Lisa Chamberlain thinks her beloved pet may have inadvertently hitched a seven-and-a-half hour ride on a delivery truck.

She said: 'I couldn't believe it when I got the call from the SPCA (Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) up in Scotland.

'They said Gypsy is really underweight but is good in herself.

'No one knows what might have happened. Maybe she accidentally got on a lorry or something, who knows.'

Gypsy was discovered crying in Motherwell by a woman who took her to the nearest Scottish SPCA centre in Hamilton, Lanarkshire.

Staff there looked after the cat by providing her with food and water after it emerged she had lost three quarters of her body weight.

Gypsy's travels began when Lisa left her bathroom window open on August 20.

Having fed and watered her three cats by 8.30pm, she settled down for the evening and only realised her black and brown feline was missing the next morning.

She said: 'Every evening I get my cats in before I have a bath. However, after I'd finished, I left the bathroom window open.

'I must have left the bathroom door open and she must have escaped out of the window.'

But, much to the delight of her family, almost nine weeks after she went missing, Gypsy was safely returned at 11pm last night by courier.

Lorraine Alba, assistant manager at the Scottish SPCA's Lanarkshire Animal Rescue and Rehoming Centre in Hamilton, said: 'When Gypsy arrived in our care we scanned her for a microchip.

'We were very surprised to learn her owner lived in Portsmouth.

'We're not entirely sure how she ended up in Motherwell but it's possible she jumped in a delivery van or on to a train.

'Gypsy went missing in August so her owner was understandably delighted to learn she had been found, albeit over 400 miles from home.

'This is a fantastic example of the benefits of microchipping as it's highly unlikely we would have been able to trace Gypsy's owner had she not been chipped.

'After two nights in our care, Gypsy was safely returned back home to Portsmouth.'

Gypsy is the second cat inside a week to have travelled north of the border after nine-year-old silver tabby Pablo was found in Fife.

Nine-year-old silver tabby Pablo disappeared from Brockley, south London, last October, with distraught owner Siobhan Campbell giving him up for dead

But last week the cat strolled into a branch of TSB bank in Rosyth, Fife, after learning how to activate the automatic door.

Shocked staff only noticed their new guest after he settled down for a nap on an armchair.

Workers handed him in to the Cats Protection charity, and when he was checked for a microchip it revealed he was 449 miles from home.

His ownerâ€™s mother Kate Partridge said she could not believe her ears when she took the call - though she admitted that Pablo - nicknamed Six Dinner Sid after a children's book - has always been a 'character'.
