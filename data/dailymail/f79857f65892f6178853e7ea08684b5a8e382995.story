As children they were inseparable, not just cousins but the best of friends.

As adults, Laura Plane and Jade Popplewell have shared a unique experience, fighting breast cancer together.

The cousins, both 34 and from Plymouth, endure chemotherapy together, go to hospital appointments with one another and step in to help when the other is facing a tough day.

But while Jade should be given the all-clear later this year, Laura's future is less certain.

Her disease is incurable having spread to her bones and spine.

Cousins and best friends, Laura Plane, second left and Jade Popplewell, third left, are both fighting cancer. Laura was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2009, while Jade was diagnosed this year

The cousins, both now 34, were inseparable as children and are now helping each other through their disease. Jade credits Laura's tireless campaigning with encouraging her to check her breasts and detect her lump early enough for life-saving treatment. Doctors have said she should be cancer-free by the end of the year

The day Laura called her cousin to tell her the devastating news, Jade revealed she too had found a lump.

She credits Laura's diagnosis and tireless campaigning, encouraging women to regularly check their breasts, with her early diagnosis - in time for life-saving treatment.  

Laura, a teacher, did not detect the tumours in her breast until the largest had grown to measure 7cm. 

She said: 'I found my cancer too late, but if everything goes to plan, Jade will be one of the lucky ones, I'm so pleased for her.'

Laura discovered that her cancer had spread in February last year - at the same time that Jade had discovered a lump.

 Laura, who supports the charity CoppaFeel, said: 'When I found out that Jade had cancer too I couldn't believe that life could be so cruel.

'We're not just cousins - we're best friends - so the news was horrendous.

'But when we realised that her cancer was treatable because it had been discovered so early, it was a relief.

'To know that my work with CoppaFeel made Jade aware of the importance of checking your breasts was fantastic.

Jade said: 'Before Laura had cancer I never checked my breasts, I didn't know I needed to.

But for Laura, left, the future is less certain. In February last year, after suffering back pain, scans revealed her cancer had returned and spread to her bones and spine. Doctors have told her the disease is now incurable

Laura (right, aged six) discovered her cancer had spread in February last year - at the same time that Jade (left, also six) had discovered a lump in her breast

'But with her charity work, she showed me how important it was.

'I was away working on a cruise ship when I found the lump while showering.

'Laura had Skyped me to tell me about her secondary cancer and in the same conversation I told her I'd found a lump.

'We were both so emotional - not only was I going through cancer, but so was my best friend.

'But if it wasn't for Laura, I wouldn't have found the lump as early as I did, she's helped to save my life.'

Laura was first diagnosed with cancer five years ago.

She said: 'I found it in March 2009 - I wasn't particularly checking my boobs, I think something just felt different.

'The idea of cancer never even crossed my mind.

'I hardly told anyone as I didn't want people to worry, but on a friend's hen do I told Jade.

'She told me to get it checked out, so I went to the doctors and was eventually told I had cancer.

'The day I found out Jade and I had planned to go to a Kings of Leon concert - Jade said we didn't have to go but I was determined to live my life as normal as possible despite having cancer so we went anyway.

'It was that point that I decided I was going to carry on as normal no matter what, and I have done ever since.'

Laura was given the all clear from breast cancer in 2010 - she returned to work and got involved with CoppaFeel.

But when her back began to ache almost four years later, doctors sent her for another scan.

The cousins said they have always been close, growing up and holidaying together. But Jade (far right and top left) said fighting cancer together has brought them even closer 

Jade said: 'Laura had skyped me to tell me about her secondary cancer and in the same conversation I told her I'd found a lump.'We were both so emotional - not only was I going through cancer, but so was my best friend'

Laura (far left and far right) now has regular scans to monitor her disease, which is currently stable 

Laura (right) said: 'I live my life normally - I still work, I have as much fun as I possibly can.' She has helped to raise more than £20,000 for the charity CoppaFeel, which encourages women to regularly check their breasts

Charity CoppaFeel say there is no right or wrong way for a woman to check her breasts.

They advise women to know the signs and symptoms of breast cancer, check their breasts regularly and seek medical advice if a woman notices something that is abnormal for them.

The charity advises to look out for:

One in eight women will experience breast cancer in their lifetime, with 400 men being diagnosed every year. 

Doctors revealed that the cancer had spread to Laura's bones and spine. It was then they told her the disease was incurable. 

'I knew I could go one way or the other,' she said. 'I could either focus on what was wrong with me, or I could live my life.

'I now have regular scans to monitor the cancer and its growth and at the moment it's stable, but obviously it won't go away.

'But I live my life normally - I still work, I have as much fun as I possibly can, and so far we've raised more than £20,000 for CoppaFeel.'

Now, the cousins continue to support each other throughout their illness.

Jade said: 'On the days where I'm not so good, Laura will come round to mine, armed with sweets and DVDs, and chill out on the sofa, and I'll do the same for her.

'And if we're both feeling particularly good, we'll make sure we make the most of it and have fun.

'We go to hospitals and chemo with each other, we're always together. 

'We've always been close, we grew up together and spent holidays together, but now we're even closer.

Jade is pictured with friends after having her head shaved. She said: 'I feel incredibly grateful to Laura for making me realise how important it was to check my breasts. My cancer was grade three aggressive, so if I hadn't have found it as early as I did, I may not be here'

'We both know exactly what the other is going through, so it's great to have someone to talk too.

'Because Laura has been through it all before she could tell me what to expect and prepare for it all.

'She gives me tips about wigs and things like that - just small things that make life a bit easier.

'I feel incredibly grateful to Laura for making me realise how important it was to check my breasts.

'My cancer was grade three aggressive, so if I hadn't have found it as early as I did, I may not be here.'

Laura said: 'Early detection is just so important,' she said. 'When I found my lump it was 7cm, but when Jade found hers it was just 2.5cm.

'Now Jade is undergoing treatment and should be cancer free very soon, whereas for me there is no cure.

'Now I go around to schools and various groups to educate people on checking their breasts.

'Jade and I are proof that it can make a real difference.

'I always be thankful that I've played some part in ensuring my cousin is going to be ok.'

As a result of her work with CoppaFeel, Laura won the Pride of Britain award for the South West region and will attend the finals in London next month.
