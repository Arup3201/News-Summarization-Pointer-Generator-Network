A technology tycoon, his wife and four of their grandchildren died of smoke inhalation and extreme heat in an enormous fire at their opulent mansion in Annapolis.

The remains of Don and Sandra Pyle and grandchildren Alexis, eight, Kaitlyn, seven, Charlotte, eight, and Wesley, six, were pulled from the huge Maryland property.

It caught fire in the early morning of January 19, and burned for hours after a faulty electrical point set a huge, dry Christmas tree on fire.

Maryland's Chief Medical Examiner confirmed Tuesday that the deaths of all six were due to 'smoke inhalation and thermal injuries'.

Though the four children share a surname - Boone - they were cousins from different branches of the family. Aleix and Kaitlyn were sisters; Charlotte and Wesley were also siblings.

Neither set of parents was in the house at the time of the fire. Surviving members of the Pyle and Boone families declined to comment when approached by the Baltimore Sun.

Fire chiefs in Annapolis had earlier revealed that the 16,000 square foot home, valued at $9million, was razed to the ground after a dried-out, 15ft Christmas tree caught fire at around 3am.

According to investigators, the dried-out tree was cut down 65 days before it caught fire, and had been standing in the so-called Great Room of the house for more than a month. 

Intense: The blaze, which began in the small hours of 19 January, continued to burn in parts for more than a day

Still going: Investigators are still trying to work out how the fire spread so quickly through the home

The family was asleep in the house, having just been out to the Medieval Times themed restaurant, when a faulty electrical fitting gave off a spark which set alight the tree, which was surrounded by dry needles.

Officials said smoke detectors would have sounded, but that the house had no sprinkler system to fight the blaze, as it was built before they became a legal requirement.

It is not clear how much sprinklers would have helped had they been there. The fire department continues to investigate how the fire spread so quickly through the house.

Part of the probe, which is being carried out by federal investigators as well as Anne Arundel County's Fire Department, will involve buying similar and drying them out in a bid to recreate the blaze.

Asleep: Fire officials said all six victims were sleeping when the house set alight around 3am

Though the families did not speak after the latest information was released, an earlier statement thanked investigators and spoke of their personal sense of loss.

It said: 'The brave members of these organizations have faced dangerous conditions and heart-breaking discoveries, but they have repeatedly amazed us with their professionalism, respect for our family, and dedication to their work

'We believe that life is about making memories. As we work through our pain and loss, the memories we made with our family will sustain us. We ask for continued respect of our need for time and privacy as we struggle to begin healing.'
