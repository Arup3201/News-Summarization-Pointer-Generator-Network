Murder: Susan Buckley (pictured) killed her on-off boyfriend in a row over Christmas presents

A woman has been jailed for life after she murdered her on-off boyfriend in a drunken row over presents on Christmas Day.

Susan Buckley left Geoffrey Carter with two stab wounds and a black eye before setting his flat alight, leaving him to die from the fumes as he lay passed out on his bed.

The 57-year-old was seen covered in soot and screaming for help outside the flat in Walsall, West Midlands.

Buckley denied murder throughout the trial, but was convicted by a jury - with the judge saying she had the opportunity to put the fire out.

She will serve at least 17 years before she can be considered for parole.

Wolverhampton Crown Court heard Buckley and her 58-year-old boyfriend had been in an on-off, love-hate relationship for 27 years before the argument.

The affair was a stormy one. Both drank heavily and would often argue and assault each other, police said.

Things came to a head on Christmas Eve last year, when the couple started drinking and arguing, continuing into the early hours of Christmas Day.

In the afternoon, Buckley threw a coat at Mr Carter together with a Christmas present he had bought for her.

Forensic evidence showed Buckley then used
 a naked flame to ignite clothes at the home of Mr Carter, which set a lounge chair alight.

Firefighters were called at around 5.30pm. When they searched the flat, they found Mr Carter lying unconscious on a bed.

He was taken to Walsall Manor Hospital but died of smoke inhalation an hour later.

A
 post mortem showed Mr Carter had died of smoke inhalation. He was 
also found to have two knife wounds to his arms and a black eye.

Judge John Wait told Buckley today: 'Geoffrey Carter was at the time of his 
death, through drink, incapable of assisting himself, though not 
otherwise vulnerable.

'This fire was started in a block of flats and it put others, the other occupants and officers from the fire service, at risk.

'Geoffrey
 Carter had not been in contact with his family for some time but his 
death has come as a terrible shock to his daughter.

'It is evident from what she has said that the last month has been very difficult for her.'

Detective Inspector Gary Plant, of West Midlands Police, said: 'Susan Buckley deliberately set fire to the inside of Geoffrey Carter’s
 flat, after she assaulted him following a further argument between the 
couple.

'The sentence reflects the serious nature of her actions.

'By
 doing what she did, she took Geoffrey Carter's life; but, if the fire 
hadn’t been controlled as quickly as it was, the lives of others within 
the block could also have been taken.

'Susan
 now has time to reflect upon her actions during the time of her 
custodial sentence and the impact it will have upon the rest of her 
life.'
