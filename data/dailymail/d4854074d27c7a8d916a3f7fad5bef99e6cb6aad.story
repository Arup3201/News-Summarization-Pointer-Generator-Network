An IT expert has fitted a barcode to his father's gravestone which when scanned reveals the story of the war hero's part in the Arctic Convoys of the Second World War.

Developer Joe Davies used QR code technology to install the barcode on the headstone, giving those who visit former Merchant Seaman Charles Davies's final resting place, an interactive guide of his life.

Anyone with a smartphone or tablet computer can scan the barcode, which then takes them to a specially created memorial webpage on the site Forever Missed.

Brainwave: Mr Davies came up with the idea after using the QR technology in his job to help people learn more about plants in public parks

Mr Davies died last year at the age of 91. The former seaman took part in the Arctic Convoys, dubbed the Suicide Missions by many taking part, and survived the infamous PQ17 'journey to hell'.

His son came up with the idea to tell his father's life story in this unique way, after using the technology to tell people in public parks more about the plants and trees.

Mr Davies, of Bridgend, South Wales, said: 'After using the codes to tell people 
more about plants it struck me how easy it would be to use it tell 
people about what an incredible life my father had.

'I had the code and website address engraved on to a plaque which could be attached to the headstone’s plinth.

'I made some inquiries and there were no issues about this code going on the headstone.

'So when we had it made I asked the stonemason if they could cut out an indentation so the plaque could be set in place.'

The webpage tells how Charles James Davies was born, one of seven children, in 1921 near Pontypridd in South Wales.

It goes on to reveal how he survived some of the darkest days of the Second World War, being hunted by German U-boats.

Friends share their memories of the former seaman and links guide people to other websites detailing more information about the deadly Arctic Convoys.

Certificates of proficiency as a merchant seaman gunner are posted on the site and video clips of family tributes given at his funeral are also included.

Mr Davies, said: 'You can encrypt any information into a QR code.

'The more dense the code is, the more information you can cram into it.

'When I was younger I didn’t have the greatest relationship with my father - but that changed in my early 20s and we became best friends.

'He is a very interesting character and went through a heck of a lot during the war. That really had a massive influence on him as a person.'

QR codes were designed in the motoring industry to track cars during the manufacturing process.

More recently they have been used for marketing and advertising campaigns, allowing owners of mobiles, smart phones and tablets to download information about products.

The North Atlantic Fleet sailed from the UK to the North Russian ports of Murmansk and Archangel to aid Russian Allies between 1941 and 1945.

The Arctic Convoys were called ‘the Suicide Missions’ by many of those men who sailed on them.

Merchant
 ships with supplies and ammunition were escorted by British Royal Naval
 ships and aircraft carriers. These supplies were vital to the war 
effort as German forces had Russia completely blockaded.

With
 German u-boats and aircraft intent on stopping supplies to Russia many 
ships were lost and over 3,000 young men perished in the icy waters of 
the North Atlantic, their bodies never to be recovered.

Supplies came initially solely from British sources with a greatly increasing quantity from America from January 1942.

Allied supplies transported to Russia included 7,411 aircraft, 4,932 anti-tank guns and 5,218 tanks.

For
 Prime Minister Winston Churchill, these supplies were a vital 
demonstration of Allied solidarity. He did however call the Arctic 
Convoys The Worst Journey in the World

With
 a total of 78 Convoys to Russia, Loch Ewe in Wester Ross, Scotland, was
 where 19 of the convoys departed, a further 23 left from Liverpool, The
 Clyde (Glasgow), Oban and Reykjavik (Iceland).

There were 36 convoys from Russia to the UK.
