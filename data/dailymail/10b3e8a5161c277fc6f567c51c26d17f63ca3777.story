This is the heart-stopping moment a daredevil kayaker plunges down a 65ft waterfall - captured from a one of a kind spectacular bird’s-eye view.

Photographer Tim Kemple rigged ropes across canyons to capture the vertigo-inducing views as the kayakers freefall down the monster drop.

Adventure-loving trio Erik Boomer, Tyler Bradt, and Galen Volckhausen spent 10 days hurtling down powerful waterfalls of up to 130ft in height on a trip to Tlapacoyan, Mexico.

Mr Kemple,from Salt Lake City, US, hung within touching distance of the kayakers as they plummeted over the waters edge.

He joined
a team of filmmakers - Anson Fogel, Skip Armstrong, and Blake Hendrix -
to capture the incredible views and turned the trip into a short 
film called ‘Cascada’.

His 
stunning vantage points show the heart-in-mouth views the gutsy kayakers
are faced with as they freefall down the monster drops like never seen 
before.

Mr Kemple said:
'The narrow, gorge-like nature of the two big rivers in Tlapacoyan 
meant there were opportunities to set up a line across the canyons.

'We didn’t expect how great it would look and with a little creativity how frequently we could pull it off.

'I could have touched the paddlers as they went by - we were literally dangling a few feet away from the lip of the waterfall.

'The
idea of this view, looking straight down the waterfall, was definitely 
one of those shots that we talked about before arriving in Mexico.

'We
weren’t the first people to shoot images in Tlapacoyan but that became 
the challenge - how could we use light, perspective, and creativity to 
capture images that people hadn’t seen anywhere before?

'Kayaking waterfalls is a
one-take situation. Even if the paddlers enter the water cleanly, it 
hurts, like getting punched in the face.'

Tyler
Bradt - who holds the world record plunge in a kayak off the 186ft 
Palouse Falls in 2009 - broke his back just two years ago on the 95ft 
Abiqua Falls in Oregon, USA.

He
said: 'Breaking my back hit the reset button for me in my waterfall 
running. I had to start back at the beginning and work up.

'This was the first time I finally felt right to run big waterfalls after over 18 months of striving to get back to that spot.

'Tim and the team captured the critical moment when everything goes right or everything goes wrong during the fall.

Team: Blake Hendrix, Tim Kemple, Tyler Bradt, Erik Boomer, Skip Armstrong, Anson Fogel, Galen Volckhausen

'It’s important for waterfall kayakers to land precisely and that is influenced by their actions at the lip of the waterfall and into the first 20 feet of free fall.

'At this moment I was focused on setting my angle correctly. Some of the beauty of waterfall running is a separation from thoughts and the purity of existing in complete presence with such an amazing force of nature.'
