Danielle Miles tried to set fire to Zorbas kebab shop in Saxmundham, Suffolk after she arrived late for an order

A furious mum who set fire to a kebab shop because it closed before she could get her chips has been jailed for 28 months.

Danielle Miles, 26, rang Zorba's takeaway to order her late-night meal at 10pm after she’d been out drinking, a court heard yesterday.

But the mum-of-three did not arrived to collect her food until nearly 11.20pm - minutes after the kebab shop closed.

Ipswich Crown Court heard Miles then stood outside screaming 'I want my chips' and threatening to set the town centre takeaway shop alight.

Godfried Duah, prosecuting, told the court  that Miles then pushed burning paper through the letterbox.

Members of staff who lived at the kebab shop in Saxmundham, Suffolk, saw Miles laughing.

Mr Duah said an employee rushed to put out the fire as she ran off.

The incident caused £50 damage to the door on November 11, the court heard.

Prosecutors said lives would have been put at risk if the fire had spread to neighbouring properties or if gas canisters near the front door had been ignited.

Miles, of Saxmundham, admitted arson being reckless as to whether lives would be endangered and was jailed for 28 months.

Workers at Zorba's kebas had to run to put out the fire, which caused £50 worth of damage

Roger Thomson, defending, said Miles has three children aged five and under and she deeply regretted what she had done.

Mr Thomson said Miles had been drinking regularly and using cannabis but had cut down on both since launching the arson attack.

He accepted Miles had set fire to the door and hurled abuse at workers inside as they watched her.

'It was done in their sight and there was no chance of it succeeding,' stressed Mr Thomson.

He said Miles had been on medication for depression at the time.

The kebab shop's owners have said they suffered from a spate of vandalism attacks from late-night drinkers.

In January this year, they even offered a reward of 'kebabs for life' for information about who had vandalised their outlet in nearby Framlingham.
