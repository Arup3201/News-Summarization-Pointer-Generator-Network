Brooklyn Beckham has been left disappointed in his attempts to secure an Arsenal scholarship.

The 15-year-old is enrolled at the club's Hale End academy and was hoping to be handed a two-year term to continue with the Gunners.

However, it is understood the teenager will not be retained next season, ending his tenure with Arsenal.

The news comes as a surprise after Beckham was called up into the club's Under 18 side earlier this month.

However, Sportsmail can reveal that Beckham was one of only a few Under 16 and Under 17 players still at the club's Hale End academy that weekend as the rest travelled to the Al Kass youth tournament in Qatar.

And many at the club's Hale End academy saw his promotion as more of a case of default rather than merit.

Beckham will remain at the club, however, until the end of the season. It is unclear whether the teenager will look to find a new club.

Having started later at Arsenal's academy than the majority of other youngsters at Hale End, Beckham was always playing catch up.

Despite the decision not to retain him, Arsenal youth coaches still rate the teenager highly, but feel other players in his right midfield position are more advanced in their development at the club.

They also feel Beckham can still make the professional grade at another club.

His brothers Romeo and Cruz are also enrolled at Hale End. Cruz, 10, is said to be the most promising of the Beckham brothers.
