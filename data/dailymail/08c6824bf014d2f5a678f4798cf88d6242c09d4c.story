If taxis are too expensive, and trains are too unreliable how about flying a dragon to work, or taking a ride on the Loch Ness Monster?

Of course, these transport options aren’t real, but you can now virtually see how long these journeys would take on Google Maps.

These Google Easter Eggs were added to celebrate the launch of public transport routes on the service across the UK.

The latest Google Easter Eggs were added to the service celebrate the launch of public transport routes across the UK. According to the tongue-in-cheek directions, travelling from the Brecon Beacons to Snowdon in Wales would take 21 minutes by dragon (pictured)

Travelling from the Brecon Beacons to Snowdon in Wales would take 21 minutes by dragon.

Riding 
Nessie between Fort Augustus and Urquhart Castle, which sit on Loch Ness
 in Inverness, Scotland, would take 28 minutes - four minutes faster than 
taking the bus.

Punting between Magdalene College and Mathematical Bridge in
 Cambridge takes 45 minutes, 
versus 18 minutes on the UNI4 bus.

While Magdalen College to Wolfson College on a punt in Oxford, weaving around the River Cherwell, takes 1 hour 32 minutes.

And it takes 1 hour 16 minutes to travel along the 
M4 between Windsor Castle, and Buckingham Palace.

Other hidden journey options include punting between the colleges of Cambridge and Oxford University, as well as riding a Royal carriage between Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace.

According to the tongue-in-cheek directions, travelling from the Brecon Beacons to Snowdon in Wales takes 21 minutes by dragon - the country’s national symbol.

Meanwhile, riding the mythical Nessie between Fort Augustus and Urquhart Castle, which sit on Loch Ness in Inverness, Scotland, takes 28 minutes - four minutes faster than taking the bus.

On the other hand, punting between Magdalene College and Mathematical Bridge in Cambridge is a much slower mode of transport and takes45 minutes, versus 18 minutes on the UNI4 bus.

This is still quicker than punting between the colleges of Oxford, however.

Magdalen College to Wolfson College, weaving around the River Cherwell, takes 1 hour 32 minutes.

And if you want to be treated like the Queen and avoid National Rail, Google has revealed it takes 1 hour 16 minutes to travel along the M4 between Windsor Castle, and Buckingham Palace.

This is a minute faster, and ultimately more comfortable, than travelling by train.

Other hidden gems in Google Maps include a place on the southern point of Half Moon Island, Antarctica that has blue roads.

When the Pegman is dragged on to these roads, he turns into a penguin.

In 2010, if travellers asked for directions between Japan and China, Google told users to ‘jetski across the Pacific Ocean’, but this appears to have been removed.

If you want to be treated like the Queen and avoid National Rail, Google has revealed it would take 1 hour 16 minutes to travel along the M4 between Windsor Castle, and Buckingham Palace on a Royal carriage - one minute faster than taking the train

Last week, Google updated its Maps service to include an extra 17,000 public transport routes around the UK.

National rail data and public transport information is already available on Google Maps in cities, including London, but this latest update extends it to the rest of the country.

Google Maps for Public Transport now features route details for buses, trains, tubes, trams and ferries.

It shows real-time departures and reveals how many interchanges there will be.

For each journey, the app compares all the available routes via the different transport modes, including walking and driving, to see which is the quickest or easiest.
