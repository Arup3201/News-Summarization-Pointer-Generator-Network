The newly deposed Premier of New South Wales has gone missing after being blacklisted from the official welcoming ceremony for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

In an embarrassing turn of events for Sydney's image, Mr O'Farrell was scheduled to greet the royal couple at Sydney airport and the Opera house just four hours after he was deposed from his position as state political leader over a scandal heard in a corruption inquiry over the gift of a (£1,600) $3,000 bottle of red wine.

But the state's former leader has gone hiatus since stepping down, with his staff stating they 'have no idea where he is'.

Toughing it out: The newly deposed Premier of New South Wales says he will still greet the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in Sydney this afternoon, just four hours after stepping down as political leader

Duke and Duchess of Cambridge Kate and William are greeted by Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and his wife Margie, among others, upon arriving in Sydney with Prince George this afternoon

Mr O’Farrell and his wife, Rosemary, were due to take part in the official line-up meeting the Duke and Duchess and their son, as well co-hosting a subsequent reception at Sydney Opera House.

When the MailOnline contacted Mr O'Farrell's office this morning to ask whether he would still be attending the ceremony this afternoon, a spokesman said everything was 'businesss as usual'.

But it was later revealed the former premier was struck off the guest list following his humiliating public statement after a corruption hearing, which could result in perjury charges.

A spokesman for Mr O'Farrell later told the MailOnline they 'weren't quite sure where he is'.

'We have no idea where he is...honestly I wouldn't be able to find out,' the spokesman said.

He also said Mr O'Farrell's public relations team, which normally handle media requests, 'didn't want to take any calls until everything has been sorted out'.

The debacle didn't seem to faze Kate and Wills - nor their gorgeous eight-month-old Prince George - who stepped off the RAAF B737 at 2.35pm looking thrilled to be in Australia.

The couple, who will be in Australia for 10 days, will visit Uluru (Ayers Rock), watch life savers on Manly Bay and visit the world famous Taronga Zoo with George, where a Bilby Enclosure is being named after the little prince.

First today, however, was a formal welcome at the airport by Australian Governor General Sir Peter Cosgrove and his wife Lady Cosgrove.

The couple will host William, Kate and George at Admiralty House, their official residence in Kirribilli, during their stay in Sydney.

Also present was the Governor of New South Wales, Her Excellency Professor the Honourable Marie Bashir, Prime Minister Tony Abbott and his wife, Margie.

First stop: Crowds are already gathered at the Sydney Opera House to catch a glimpse pf the royal couple who are due to be greeted by the Barry O'Farrell inside the concert hall just hours after he has stepped down as state political leader

Standing firm: despite resigning as Premier of New South Wales, Barry O'Farrell will still meet the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge this afternoon, although it is unclear how he will be introduced to the royal couple

A political storm had been brewing since Tuesday when Mr O'Farrell appeared as a witness before the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) and denied he had received a bottle of Australia's most famous red wine, Penfolds Grange Hermitage as a gift.

The 1959 vintage bottle of Grange had reportedly been given to the Premier by the head of Australian Water Holdings, Nick Di Giromalo, who has links with the family of Eddie Obeid, a corrupt former politician currently under investigation.

In evidence before the corruption hearing, Mr O'Farrell denied and his wife Rosemary received the wine in April 2011, saying they had been on holidays that Easter.

However, the ICAC traced a telephone call from Mr O'Farrell to Mr Di Giromalo around that time.

Both Mr O'Farrell and Rosemary O'Farrell are due to welcome William and Kate to Australia when they touch down at Sydney Airport, and again at a reception at Sydney Opera House before 400 invited guests.

Mr O'Farrell's office at the NSW State Parliament told the MailOnline that 'at this stage' the now ex-Premier and his wife planned to go ahead with meeting and greeting the royal couple.

It is unclear how Mr O'Farrell and his wife will be introduced to the Duke and Duchess.
