'My leg just started going on fire,' he told ABC.

'I had to rip my pants off. A couple of people actually said they could smell my body burning.

'It felt like when you're branding a bull or something like that.' 

Mr Johnson was left with a huge wound on his upper left thigh and now has to have his bandages changed twice a day by nurses.

Experts have said the phones can explode if their circuit boards are damaged or a different charger is used.
