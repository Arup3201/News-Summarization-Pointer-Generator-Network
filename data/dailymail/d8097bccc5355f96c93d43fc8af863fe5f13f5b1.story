Understatement is not a concept that famed fashion designer Valentino Garavani is familiar with, which is what makes these newly released images inside the designer's private spaces such a fantastical feast for the eyes.

Crystal chandeliers, lavish tableware, glitzy objets d'art and plenty of porcelain fuse together to create the most opulent of settings.

The images form part of a new book, At the Emperor's Table, a stunning visual and written account of Valentino's world and entertaining style.

The images give a glimpse inside the iconic designer's French chateau, Swiss ski chalet, luxury yacht as well as his London apartment.

As fashion editor and former American Vogue editor-at-large  André Leon Talley writes in the book's introduction, 'Valentino Garavani designs his luncheons and dinners, in all of his homes, the way he has created crescendos and allegros vivace throughout his forty-plus-year career as one of the greatest haute couture designers and high-fashion leaders in the world.'

Beauty and entertaining have long been passions of Valentino. 'I am in love with beauty,' he admits in the book's opening. 'I have always loved beautiful objects.' 

Though Talley, previously fashion editor of US Vogue and now its editor-at-large, writes that despite the supremely sumptuous settings, Valentino's excellence as a host is defined by the warmth he creates for his guests. 

The crown jewel of Valentino's residential repertoire is the Chateau de Wideville, a historic chateau outside of Paris

'When you enter his world, you enter the world of luxury; you enter a rare and opulent, yet warm space,' says Talley. 

Talking of his own experience as Valentino's guest he writes, that the atmosphere evokes 'the joy of sharing, and the joy of delivering a magnificent dining experience in a setting of wonder and originality; sharing with family, friends and guests; sharing good conversation that is quite often animated; and sharing beautiful flowers, especially from Valentino's own gardens.'

Photographed by renowned Italian photographer Oberto Gili, the book, published by Assouline, is organized by residence, and invites the reader to enjoy various table settings and recipes specific to each home.

On the designers yacht, T.M. Blue One, guests are served Mediterranean-inspired cuisine atop custom, seafaring-themed dinner service sets.

'I love sharing the things in my life with my friends,' Valentino says. Among all of these luxurious homes, the crown jewel of Valentino's residential repertoire is the Chateau de Wideville, a historic chateau outside of Paris that is admittedly Valentino's favorite. 

There, meals inspired by Italian home cooking, such as risotto Milanese, are presented amongst his collection of rare Meissen swans. 

The new book by that showcases Valentino's entertaining style 

'I love antique china sets, like Meissen, Russian, or from P.K. Selesia, a German company from the 1930s' he states. 

Though regardless of residence or number of guests, you won't catch Valentino using the cheap stuff. 

'I am very often alone and enjoying my houses,' Valentino says. 'Entertaining thirty or one is the same; the food has to be on a beautiful plate.' 

Valentino  founded his eponymous fashion house in Rome in the late 1950s and has since established an illustrious career designing for the world's most glamorous women, from royalty to Hollywood icons, including Jackie O, Elizabeth Taylor and modern-day muses like Gwyneth Paltrow and Anne Hathaway. 

From his start designing dresses, Valentino and long-time business partner Giancarlo Giammetti built the Valentino brand into an international empire, now one of the most iconic fashion brands in the world.

Though Valentino retired from fashion in 2008, his influence on fashion is still very much present.
