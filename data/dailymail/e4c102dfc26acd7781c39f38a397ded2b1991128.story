It all began with a joke but resulted in an incredible cash windfall for a 23-year-old, who has used the opportunity to treat his mother who raised him single-handedly.

In January Sydney-based Mat Carpenter, then 22, made global headlines with his kooky business idea to help people get revenge by shipping envelopes filled with glitter to their enemies.

He was astonished when the website, ShipYourEnemiesGlitter.com went viral, attracting so much attention that just ten days after its inception he sold the website for an incredible six-figure sum. 

'I was blown away by the success of the website,' Mr Carpenter told Daily Mail Australia.

'I was completely unaware of how successful the idea was going to become. 

'I started off with no glitter & no envelopes which sort of shows you how much I didn't believe in what I thought was a stupid idea.'

His mother had no idea where she was or what was in store as she was led over to the car

He sold the domain for $US 85,000. Although he joked it was the equivalent of '$11 in Australia', incredibly Carpenter pocketed over $AUD 100 000

Rather than indulging himself with a lavish lifestyle, the first thing Mr Carpenter wanted to do was take the chance to thank his mother.

Mr Carpenter bought his mother her first ever new car for her birthday to say thank you for her sacrifices for her children.

'Buying a car for mum was a no brainer,' Mr Carpenter told Daily Mail Australia. 

'Her old car was (rubbish) that only liked to work when it could be bothered which is basically a lazier version of me. 

'When you're growing up with a single parent & see them working three or four jobs at a time just to put a roof over your head it's extremely rewarding to give back.'

The brains behind the business left his mum speechless after she was blindfolded and driven 40 minutes to the car yard for the amazing surprise.

The 23-year-old's mum had been relying on family and friends to drive her to and from work after her car broke down three months ago and she couldn't afford to get it fixed.

The footage shows his mother blindfolded in the front seat of the car throughout the 40-minute trip.

With a glass of wine in hand, she gets into the spirit by grooving to the music on the radio.

'Mum, where do you think you are right now?' Mathew asks.

'I have no idea,' she replies.

'Do you know where we're going?'

'Nup,' says Ms Carpenter, making dance moves in her seat.

'She's drunk,' a female voice can be heard to say.

She couldn't believe her eyes when she saw her first ever brand new car in front of her

Difficult to grasp what was happening, his mother silently walked over to the car

As she is guided by her daughter to the car she comments that it: 'it feels like we have gone around in a circle' when Mathew confirms that she had.

He then says 'mum take your blindfold off' which she does and turns away after being blinded by the sunlight.

Mathew goes on to proudly announce the generous gift: 'mum this is your brand new car.'

His mother managed to say 'oh my god' in between her jaw dropping to the floor and clapping her hands in delight.

Difficult to grasp what was happening, she silently walked to the car.

She slowly gets in the pink vehicle and looked around in a state of shock when Mathew asked her if she liked his kind deed.

'Oh my god it's amazing,' she eventually said looking in awe at her first ever brand new car. 

It's an incredible start for the young entrepreneur who clearly has a lot of promise - particularly when it comes to quirky concepts. 

'My plans going forward is to continue on with my New Years resolution of working on more projects,' he said.

'I'm currently developing a mobile application for both Android & iOS and we'll be accepting BETA users at the end of this month. 

'I can't go into too much detail but as you can imagine any project I'm involved with is going to be a bit offbeat.'
