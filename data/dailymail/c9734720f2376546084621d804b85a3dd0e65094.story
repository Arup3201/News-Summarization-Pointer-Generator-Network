Motorists have won a landmark judgement after the High Court ruled it illegal for a cash-strapped council to hike parking charges as a revenue-raising stealth ‘tax’ to subsidise its other services.

Motoring groups said the ruling was ‘fantastic news’ which had major implications for millions of drivers because it would stop local authorities across the country ‘picking on drivers’ to fill their empty coffers by imposing similar illegal parking ‘taxes’.

A High Court judge ruled Barnet council in north London acted unlawfully when it increased the cost of residents' parking permits and visitor vouchers in controlled parking zones (CPZs) to raise revenue.

Objectors complained that the increases had made parking in Barnet's quiet residential streets 'more expensive than parking outside Harrods' and were ‘picking the pockets’ of residents'.

Fight: Barnet resident David Attfield led the legal action against the council's unfair parking charges

They argued that around 10 per cent of Barnet residents, who lived in CPZs, were heavily subsidising transport services for the whole borough and that the parking hikes were designed by the council to fund expenditure on road maintenance, subsised concessionary fares and other road transport costs.

Mrs Justice Lang  agreed, declaring at London's High Court that the 1984 Road Traffic Regulation Act ‘is not a fiscal measure and does not authorise the authority to use its powers to charge local residents for parking in order to raise surplus revenue for other transport purposes’.

The judge ruled that Barnet had misinterpreted the law when it concluded that it was lawful for the council 'to budget for a surplus (of parking charges) at any level which it considered appropriate in order to generate income for other transport purposes which it wished to fund.'

Residents in the borough had originally faced residential parking charges of £20 for a first car and 35p each for visitor vouchers.

Those charges were increased in 2006 to £40 and £1. But in 2011 they soared to £100 and £4 - among the highest controlled parking zone charges in London.

The ruling is believed by experts to be 
the first successful legal challenge against the level of parking 
charges set by a local authority. It could see thousands of Barnet 
residents reclaim millions of pounds in unlawfully collected charges.

Campaign: Barnet CPZ Action group led the fight against the council

More significantly it could lead to many more legal challenges and prevent similar actions.

Professor Stephen Glaister is director of the RAC Foundation which had given evidence backing the residents. He said: ‘Our position has now been vindicated.

‘This is fantastic news for drivers. The law is explicit - parking charges are about managing congestion, not raising revenue.

'If there is a surplus collected then there are strict rules on what it can be used for. Why did Barnet ever think it had an arguable case to pick on one group of residents to shoulder an additional tax?’.’

Professor Glaister said he had some sympathy with cash-strapped councils, but added: ’But we have no sympathy for attempts to make up the shortfall by arbitrarily picking on drivers. That view has now been backed by the courts.

‘Councils thinking of turning to motorists to balance the books would do well to read the judgement and put their heads back below the parapet. This ruling will be felt by hundreds of local authorities and benefit millions of drivers.’

The ruling was achieved by the Barnet CPZ Action group, made up of residents from the borough, including solicitor David Attfield, who brought the lead case.

Mr Attfield, from East Finchley, won the quashing of the council's decision in February 2011 to dramatically increase the charges with effect from April 2011.

The judge rejected arguments put forward by council lawyers that it had powers under section 45 of the 1984 Act to raise a surplus from parking charges for transport functions.

There were no parking charges in Mr 
Attfield's quiet residential road until the Controlled-Parking Zone CPZ 
was first introduced in 2001 to prevent tube commuters parking in local 
streets.

The judge 
ordered the council to repay the parking charges unlawfully obtained 
from Mr Attfield, plus his legal costs, opening the way for other 
residents to seek their money back.

The
judge formally rejected Barnet's application to appeal against her 
ruling, but the council can still ask the Court of Appeal to hear the 
case. Mrs Justice Lang said her orders against Barnet would be stayed 
until the appeal court makes a decision.

Unfair: The cash-strapped council put the cost of permits up by up to 300 per cent to raise money for other projects

Mr Attfield, a 46-year-old father of two, said after his victory: ‘Barnet Council has been caught picking the pockets of residents. They were being made to contribute disproportionately to a range of services such as road repairs and the provision of bus passes across the borough.

'Simply holding a summer BBQ or a children's party could cost £40 in parking charges. An elderly person enjoying regular visits from a relative could face an annual cost of £800.

‘Today's judgment confirms that 
Parliament never intended local authorities to take a large cut every 
time a book club meets, mums get together for coffee or a washing 
machine is repaired.’

It 
was regrettable that Barnet spent more than two years, and tens of 
thousands of pounds defending actions ‘which they should have known were
legally and morally wrong,’ he said.

Mr
Attfield's solicitor, Andrew Brookes, a partner at London law firm 
Anthony Gold, said his client stood to gain just £120 rebate and was not
motivated by money: ‘He was motivated by this being a matter of 
principle and his concern for all the people who could clearly not 
afford this astronomical hike in fees.’

He
added: 'It is a tribute to David's commitment and tenacity that he was 
not prepared to give up as he encountered many bureaucratic or legal 
obstacles along the way. This ruling now clearly proves that Barnet 
Council, rather than funding parking through its fees, as the Government
intended when it passed the law, was raising money for illegitimate and
unlawful purposes.’

Barnet council leader, Richard 
Cornelius, conceded that the increase in charges had been carried out 
‘too abruptly and rather charmlessly’, but said there would be an 
appeal.

Targeted: Residents who lived in the controlled parking zones around Barnet High Street had to pay the 'stealth tax' to the council

Brandon Lewis, Minister for Local Government, said: ‘This Government has been very clear that parking charges are not, and should not be, a town hall stealth tax on local residents. We have scrapped the Labour Government's guidance which pressured councils to hike up parking charges.

Indeed, making sure that car parking charges are reasonable is an important way in which councils can help support their local high streets and local shops.’

Some councils have also been criticised for appearing to use cash raised from on-street parking and fines to subsidise other services.  Any which are found to be doing so may also face legal challenges on similar grounds.

The RAC Foundation noted: ‘No on-street charges can be levied to raise revenue

‘The power to make charges for parking is defined by law to be for “relieving or preventing congestion of traffic”.

‘There are also more general powers to manage parking for safety and amenity but these do not also permit charging.’

It said: ‘The law is quite clear that local authorities may only impose charges for controlling congestion. They have no power to impose charges in order to raise money for any other purpose.’

Currently Barnet residents can buy two types of visitor vouchers for friends or tradespeople needing to park near their homes.

A book of 12 ‘half-day’ vouchers, which last up to four hours,  and 
costs £26.40 – averaging £2.20 each or a book of 12 all-day vouchers 
which costs £49.92, averaging £4.16 each.
