Newcastle have made a £3million bid for Tottenham and Queens Park Rangers target Jamaal Lascelles. 

The 20-year-old was left out of Nottingham Forest's friendly with West Brom at the weekend and is keen on a move to the North East rather than a switch to London.

The England Under 20 international is one of the hottest prospects outside the Barclays Premier League and has attracted interest from a host of top-flight clubs. 

Newcastle have also enquired about goalkeeper Karl Darlow at Forest who has been watched by Liverpool and Tottenham. Darlow is 23 and he and Lascelles could be loaned back depending on other signings.
