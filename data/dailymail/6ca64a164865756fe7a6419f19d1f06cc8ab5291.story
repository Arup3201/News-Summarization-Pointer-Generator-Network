New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has called on anti-police protesters to stand down until after the funeral for two slain Brooklyn officers, but his plea has fallen on deaf ears.

Civil rights activists led by Reverend Al Sharpton were quick to dismiss de Blasio's request issued Monday and vowed to carry on protests stemming from the decisions of two separate grand juries not to indict police officers responsible for the killings of Michael Brown in Missouri and Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York. .

'It's a time for everyone to put aside political debates, put aside protests, put aside all of the things we will talk about in due time,’ de Blasio said in a speech to a charity with close ties to the New York Police Department.

The mayor has faced sharp criticism from law enforcement officials for siding with demonstrators in the days after officers Rafael Ramos, 40, and his partner, Wenjian Liu, 28, were gunned down in cold blood while sitting in their patrol car in East New York Saturday.

Their deaths heightened tensions that had been coursing for months between City Hall, the police department and the reform-minded protesters who voted for de Blasio in large numbers.

Even de Blasio's assurance on Monday that he would attend the slain officers' funerals, normally an unquestioned mayoral duty, took on a political charge.

Earlier this month, the city's largest police union said the mayor had abandoned the police and urged members to sign a letter insisting that the mayor stay away from their funeral should they be killed while on duty.

Police identified the killer as Ismaaiyl Brinsley, who wrote online that he planned to avenge the deaths of Garner and Brown, who were both unarmed black men killed by white officers. Brinsley killed himself with a shot to the head soon after.

‘Let's comfort these families, let's see them through these funerals,’ de Blasio said in his speech, hours after visiting the officers' grieving families with Bill Bratton, the police commissioner. ‘Then debate can begin again.’

But Al Sharpton said de Blasio's call was too vague to heed.

Not listening: Rev Al Sharpton said de Blasio's request to suspend protests was too ill-defined 

An activist group denounced the mayor's plea as an ‘outrageous’ attempt to ‘chill’ free expression. Pictured here is a man holding a protest sign during a demonstration against police violcence in Grand Central Station Monday

Protesters plan to continue their activities, despite claims from the NYPD that the officers' killer was inspired by the anti-police movement 

‘Is a vigil a protest? Is a rally?’ Sharpton said in a telephone interview, calling de Blasio's comments ‘an ill-defined request.’

Sharpton, who joined Garner's relatives over the weekend to denounce the slaying of the officers, said he would not change planned prayer vigils at the scene of Garner's death and elsewhere over the coming days to mark the family's first Christmas without him.

The Answer Coalition, an activist group, denounced the mayor's plea as an ‘outrageous’ attempt to ‘chill’ free expression. It said it had no intention of cancelling a long-planned protest march on Tuesday evening.

At least one small candle-light vigil called for by a separate coalition of groups took place in Brooklyn on Monday evening, an organizer said.

De Blasio's remarks came two days after his tense relationship with the city's police unions and rank-and-file officers hit its lowest ebb when two union leaders said the mayor had 'blood on his hands' for the officers' deaths.

The Patrolmen's Benevolent Association and the Sergeant's Benevolent Association have accused de Blasio, a Democrat who ran for office on a platform of police reform, of helping incite a loathing of police through public remarks noting that he understood some of the protesters' grievances.

Even if protesters say they will not be quieted, the heads of the city's police unions had agreed to suspend any lobbying efforts tied to the protests until after both officers are buried, Bratton said.

Rank-and-file officers have taken to social media sites and message boards to express their frustration with the mayor. 

On sites like PoliceOne and Thee Rant, officers wrote anonymous posts calling on de Blasio to stay away from the slain cops' funerals.

'A little too little. A little too late,' wrote user Interceptor828. 'I am wondering if he feels that it is worth a confrontation showing up to a funeral no one wants him at.'

Another user by the moniker otjkid ranted at the mayor: 'Back peddling too late . You hate us. Get lost. All of sudden you support us with 400 million dollars for what? Cameras lol. Bratton you kissing this guys a*** is disgusting.'

Investigators said a video on Brinsley's cell phone showed him filming a protest against excessive police force at New York's Union Square Park.

Rejecting the unions' arguments, de Blasio said the attack should not be tied to the recent protests, which in New York have been largely peaceful. But some protesters said the mayor sent the opposite message by using Brinsley's actions as a reason to temporarily stop protests.

De Blasio has been on shaky ground with the police department since before he assumed office last January.

During the mayoral campaign, the populist Democrat spoke out against the Bloomberg administration's controversial stop-and-frisk policy, accusing police of disproportionately targeting young black men for random searches. 

De Blasio also has strong ties to Al Sharpton, who has organized numerous rallies protesting against mistreatment of inner city black men at the hands of police officers.

Politico wrote that during the campaign last year, de Blasio's aides were convinced that members of his security detail made up of police officers were listening in on his private conversations inside his city-assigned car.

According to an unnamed former staffer of the mayor's, de Blasio would leave the vehicle to make sure the officers were not eavesdropping on him
