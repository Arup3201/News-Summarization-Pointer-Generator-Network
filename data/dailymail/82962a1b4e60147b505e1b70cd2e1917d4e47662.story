Kelly Brook cooked up a storm in a set of sexy pictures for her new underwear range for New Look last week.

Now the curvy Celebrity Juice presenter, 33, has put some clothes on for her latest venture with the High Street fashion brand: a festive clothing line.

Oozing vampish glamour, Kelly models three glitzy looks in new images and behind the scenes footage including a fitted black £40 dress with daring thigh split.

Kelly wears dress (£39.99) necklace (£12.99) and shoes (£29.99) from her New Look Christmas collection

Materials include plush velvet, shimmering sequins and on-trend Aztec brocade.

Kelly's
latest partywear range aims to be a modern take on 
glamour and features eye-catching details such as jewelled necklines 
and bold shoulder detailing.

Alongside fail-safe black, she has worked with rich wine-tones and metallic effects for extra festive dazzle.

The collection features everything from cute shorts and svelte midi-length pencil skirts to hit-the-floor evening gowns.

Stand-out
pieces include a sequined jumpsuit suspended from delicate 
lingerie-like shoulder-straps. The same pretty shoulder-strap detailing 
appears on dresses and camisole tops.

In the behind the scenes video for FashTag TV, Kelly says she is not a 'typical model shape' and that it's nice when she gets people messaging her with thanks.

'I'm not a size zero. There should be different body shapes representing different bodies,' she says.

In terms of inspiration for her New Look ranges, Kelly says she look to everything from music videos, movies, and the catwalk - especially Giles.

Her Christmas clothing collection in particular, she says, is inspired by Balmain.

'It has strong details, collars, shoulders... very 80s power woman. It's a strong, powerful look.'

The TV presenter says her personal style idols include Lana Del Rey and Lily Allen.

'I love Lana's videos, style, music - everything about her. She's got that Old Hollywood vibe,' she says.

Meanwhile, she admires Allen's fifties dresses, converse and gold hoops combo look.

'Chav meets fifties meets Hollywood, that's my vibe,' says Kelly.

The model, actress and presenter admits she is slightly less confident how she is a bit older, as she is competing against 20-year-olds, but she doesn't let that put her down.

'I’m very accepting of getting older and I don’t know if there’s anything I’d want to change,' she tells the Express.

'My
body’s changing naturally anyway and it’s not like I want to look 20 
again. I just want to look healthy and happy. If you’re a good person, 
happy and confident, then it comes through in your eyes.'

Her festive fashion pieces include high heeled platform shoes (£29.99) and glitzy clutch bags (from £19.99)

Kelly is proud to represent shapes other than size zero in the modelling world

She says her new clothing line, featuring strong shoulders for an 80s look, is inspired by Balmain

As well as the £39.99 twist-front maxi
dress, that could hold its own on any red carpet, 
there's a modern prom frock combining black bodice and gold 
sequin skirt with a chic filmy organza overlay, for 
£44.99.

Accessories such as hot heels in lace 
or glimmering glitter at £29.99, and must-have box-bags or 
clutches, from £19.99, complete the New Look Christmas party look.

Kelly, who is single after splitting up with on-off love Danny Cipriani, is spending some time in Los Angeles.

She seems to have moved on from her break-up though after getting close to Gethin Jones. The model was spotted on a dinner date with Daybreak presenter, 35, in Los Angeles.

She was also seen leaving his apartment, where he has been living while looking for work in the United States.
