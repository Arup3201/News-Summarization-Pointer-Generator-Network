A high school teacher in Utah has been charged with rape for allegedly having a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old student who was able to accurately describe tattoos on her body and the layout of her home.

Brianne Altice, 34, an English teacher at Davis High School in Kaysville, Utah, was charged in Farmington's 2nd District Court with three counts of rape, a first-degree felony.

The 17-year-old boy admitted to investigators in November that he had had sex with Altice on three occasions between January of 2012 and October of 2013.

Altice's husband filed for divorce in November, according to court records.

'The defendant occupied a position of special trust in relation'. to the juvenile, prosecutors wrote.

Altice was originally arrested in October. Altice was believed to have had sex with a 17-year-old on many occasions, including at her South Weber home and at a park, a Davis County Jail report states.

The teen was allegedly able to accurately describe the layout of Altice's home to detectives as well as tattoos on her body.

She has been placed on paid administrative leave by the Davis School District in October pending the outcome of the investigation.

Police have said there may be other potential victims.

The 17-year-old boy, a student at Davis High School, admitted to investigators on Monday that he had had sex with Altice at least seven times between January of 2012 and October of 2013

Altice was only hired by the high school last August, but had previously worked for other schools in the district since 2004.

‘Anytime a story surfaces like this ... I think it all causes us concern because these are members of the community that are held to a higher standard,’ district spokesman Chris Williams told Deseret News.

Altice is the fourth Utah teacher currently facing charges of sexually abusing children.
