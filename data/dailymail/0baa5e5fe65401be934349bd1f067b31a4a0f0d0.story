Failure. That was England’s abrupt summary of this result. There were no excuses or caveats, no attempts to sugar-coat another narrow loss. In their eyes, it amounted to failure. Again.

Amid valid concerns about English decision-making under pressure on the field, there could be no questioning their clarity of thought in the aftermath of this second Test as they sifted through the wreckage of a series defeat.

If the national team are to have genuine hope of winning the World Cup next year it is imperative that the inquest is harsh at times like this and the initial indications are that it certainly will be.

As was the case in Auckland a week earlier there was no great pride after a fall, despite the late rearguard action which turned a procession into a photo-finish.

Falling short: England front rowers David Wilson, Joe Marler and Rob Webber trudge after All Blacks loss

Over and out: Julian Savea scores a try to increase New Zealand's lead against England

Catch me if you can: Ben Smith scored a try for New Zealand against England

Two tries in the closing stages, after
 the All Black storm had blown over, amounted to a distortion of the 
true picture. Having roared ahead through Marland Yarde’s early try, 
England ultimately  finished a distant second, despite the tight margin 
on the scoreboard.

Mike 
Brown touched down during that late, face-saving fightback but he 
avoided the temptation to paper over the cracks in the tourists’  
performance. ‘We are not going to start applauding failure,’ said the  
Harlequins full back. ‘We don’t applaud mediocrity. We are in a business
 where winning counts. If we want to win a World Cup, we’ve got to beat 
teams like New Zealand. It’s a tough second week in a row where we’ve 
pushed the No 1 team in the world and been a fingertip away from turning
 them over.’

Regrets 
primarily related to the tendency for a fog to envelop English minds 
when they needed 20-20 vision. Too often the wrong option was taken. 
While their opponents demonstrated supreme decision-making and clinical 
precision at crucial moments, Stuart Lancaster’s men could not respond 
in kind.

Asked to identify 
the ‘one per cent’ factors that continue to separate these teams, 
England captain Chris Robshaw said: ‘They take their chances, it’s as 
simple as that. There isn’t any secret recipe. We’re getting better and 
better and it will click, but it takes time.’

There
 was a sense on Saturday night of stereotypes being shattered as England
 were left to curse their habit of being too gung-ho in possession. A 
nation still largely pigeon-holed around the world for relying on a big 
pack and a quality goal-kicker were berating themselves for an excess of
 adventure and failing to retain composure.

Promise: England made an encouraging start when Marland Yarde scored an early try

Lacking: England were unable to build on the good start and capitalise on the early try though

Match-winners: Julian Savea and Ben Smith celebrate their convincing victory against England

Make sure: Ma'a Nonu added a third try to put the All Blacks well in control of the game

Regroup: England learnt a lot about themselves during the rollercoaster ride against New Zealand

When
 Brown was asked about  the shortcomings that must be  rectified in 
Saturday’s final Test in  Hamilton, he said: ‘Taking different decisions
 in different areas. We probably played around a bit too much in the 
middle of the field. It is great we are showing the ambition but it’s 
about understanding when it’s the right time, when it’s not.’

With
 hindsight, England were left to rue the fact that when Billy  
Twelvetrees tried to force an offload in the 43rd minute, it definitely 
was not the right time to do so.

In
 the blink of an eye, a promising position for the tourists became a 
telling strike at the other end as Aaron Cruden swept clear and sent 
magnificent full back Ben Smith, an Otago local, away to score.

Invariably,
 the All Blacks made the right decision, even when operating in tight 
spaces on the short side where their near-flawless  technique and 
telepathy were there for all to see. The same could not be said for 
England.

Running man: Billy Twelvetrees of England skips past Ma'a Nonu during the first-half

In the book: Owen Farrell, centre, is shown the yellow card by referee Jaco Peyper

In the first half, 
the visitors had spread mayhem in the Kiwi defence but with several men 
forming an overlap on the right, Danny Care passed to an isolated 
Robshaw on the left and the scoring chance was squandered.

Just
 before the break, England should have taken their lead to 17-3 but Manu
 Tuilagi was unable to blast through Smith’s tackle after breaking clear
 down the right and Brown couldn’t quite catch up in support to take an 
inside pass.

These are the 
tiny margins separating the world’s leading Test team and their pursuers
 who find themselves chasing Kiwi vapour trails.

When
 the All Blacks smelt  blood after half-time, they found attacking gears
 that take them to heights beyond the reach of  England and every other 
country — at least for now.

Pace: Manu Tuilagi was moved onto the wing by Stuart Lancaster in a bold move

Formidable: New Zealand stand for their national anthem ahead of the game at the Forsyth Barr Stadium

Ma’a
 Nonu was involved in the move that led to Julian Savea’s 50th-minute 
try and the centre then assumed the role of finisher as midfield partner
 Conrad Smith went into his familiar safe-cracking mode to open up 
England’s defence. The home No 13 showcased the sort of nous and 
awareness that England must add to their expanding repertoire in the 
next 12 months.

‘Decision-making
 is the final step we have to take,’ said Lancaster. Fair comment. His 
team rallied with late tries by Brown and Chris Ashton but it didn’t 
alter the impression of a global hierarchy being reasserted.

Now England must somehow summon the will to snatch a consolation win five days from now.

They are desperate to depart  with something to show for their  spirited efforts.

‘We’ve got another chance to  finish this tour with a bit of pride,’ said Brown.

‘By pushing a team like this on their home patch we showed how far we’ve come — but we’re judged on wins.’
