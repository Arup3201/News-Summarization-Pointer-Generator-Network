House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner is expected to announce a new investigation this week into the emails Hillary Clinton sent while she was Secretary of State.

Clinton has been under fire after it was revealed she used a personal email account - hrd22@clintonemail.com - instead of a government one while leading the State Department.

At a press conference last week, Clinton said all of her 'work-related' emails from the personal account were delivered to the State Department after a 'thorough' review.

But top House Republicans told ABC News that Boehner plans to further investigate after Clinton admitted to destroying more than 31,000 emails that were deemed personal. 

A question-and-answer document distributed by Clinton states that 30,490 emails were designated as 'work-related', while 31,380 were determined to be 'private and personal'.

Clinton said that subjects of the personal emails varied from planning her daughter Chelsea's wedding to her mother's funeral. 

She added that she had deleted the personal emails because she did not feel there was any reason to save them. 

Clinton acknowledged that it 'would've been better' if she had used a second email account and carried a second phone but at the time had opted for the 'convenience' of only having to carry one device for all her emails.

She also noted that the 'vast majority' of her work emails were sent to government email addresses and were thus 'captured and preserved immediately' on the State Department's system.  

Clinton has asked the State Department to make her work-related emails public.  

The personal email address surfaced as multiple congressional panels investigated the 2012 attack on a US diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya, during Clinton's State Department tenure.

A special House Committee exclusively focused on auditing the executive branch's response to the 2012 Benghazi terror attack is subpoenaing emails from Clinton's personal account.  

Republican Representative Trey Gowdy, the head of the committee, said he wants Clinton to testify about her email practices before Congress by April. 

'Who gets to decide what's personal and what's public?' he said on Fox News. 'I just can't trust her lawyers to make the determination that the public is getting everything they're entitled to.'

As for Clinton, she said believes most people will understand that 'no one' wants their personal emails made public and will 'respect  that privacy'.
