A daughter has been ordered today to repay at least £290,000 into her dead mother's estate after a top judge ruled that she had unintentionally exerted ‘undue influence’ over the widow.

Susan Burbidge, 47, was 
locked in a bitter legal war with her brothers and other family members 
over cash and property transfers made to her from her mother Phyllis 
Hart in the year before she died.

In an acrimonious and enormously costly
High Court struggle, her brothers, Ken and Paul Hart, accused Mrs Burbidge of 
taking control of their 'vulnerable' 86-year-old mother’s finances in the months 
before her death in 2008.

However she said she bore the burden 
of looking after Mrs Hart and that her brother Ken stopped visiting her 
and did not send flowers on Mother's Day.

Judge Sir William Blackburne today 
acquitted Mrs Burbidge of any conscious wrong-doing, but said that her 
'relationship of influence' over mother cast doubt on whether the pensioner’s generosity came from her own free will.

In a ruling which 
represents a financial catastrophe for Susan and her husband Brian, the 
judge expressed ‘real concern’ that Phyllis had not ‘really understood’ 
the many letters she signed shortly before her death.

He
said that Phyllis’s gifts to her daughter ‘called for an explanation’ 
and that Susan had failed to convince him that her mother appreciated 
exactly what she was doing and was acting ‘fully independently’.

Although
Susan paid £410,000 into Mrs Hart's estate before the case hit court, 
the ruling means she must pay back the balance of what her mother gave 
her, at least £290,000.

The judge ruled that her brothers and 
her mother’s other heirs should be in the same position they would have 
been in had the gifts never been made.

During the eight-day case, Mrs 
Burbidge had vehemently denied she was out to get as much of the estate 
as she could and insisted she only ever had her mother’s best interests 
at heart.

She said of her 
brothers: 'We didn’t get on. I didn’t like the way they treated mum. It 
upset mum and I was incredibly protective of mum. The only thing I was 
protective of was my mother.

'My
aim where mum was concerned was to make sure that, in her last few 
years of life, she was happy; that she wasn’t left on her own.

'It was for me to look after mum and make sure she was OK. That was my intention.'

The court heard Mrs Hart, who lived 
in Upton, Poole, until the final year of her life, inherited the 
£1million-plus estate when her husband Ernest, who had a successful 
marquee business, died in 2005.

Ken Hart, 67, of Poole, claimed that,
by 2007, his mother was increasingly under the influence of his sister 
and denied that he had in any way neglected his filial duties.

He said he had been working long hours and had done his best to keep in touch when she moved house during her final year.

He previously said in court that his mother was a
'good woman and housewife' but claimed she 'could not make up her mind 
about anything' - even when it came to choosing her own curtains.

And she had no idea about financial matters, he told the court.

Tension was already building within 
the family after Phyllis announced the previous year that she was 
transferring part of the company's business premises to Susan, the court
heard.

The brothers' lawyers say that, by the 
time of Phyllis's death, nearly everything her husband had left her - 
valued at over £1million - had been transferred to Susan Burbidge and her 
husband Brian, subject to an 'unsigned loan agreement' that the couple 
would pay back £410,000 into her estate.

Mrs Burbidge's barrister, Paul Emmerson, 
suggested that Kenneth had succeeded in 'alienating' his mother, who had
become increasingly 'angry and bitter' at his apparent indifference.

Ruling on the case today, Sir William 
said all the witnesses in the case had tried to speak honestly about 
events as they saw them and that there had been no conscious wrong-doing
in Mrs Burbidge’s dealings with her mother.

However,
he concluded: 'I am left at the end of the day with a real concern as 
to whether Phyllis really understood the many letters that went out 
under her signature.

'Even 
if, contrary to the evidence, Phyllis did fully understand what she was 
doing and fully intended to act as she did, the question remains, was what she did the result of the exercise of an independent will?'

Emphasising
the relationship of trust and reliance between mother and daughter, he 
concluded: 'At the end of the day it is for Susan to persuade me that 
her mother was acting fully independently of this undue influence. I am 
not persuaded that she was.'
