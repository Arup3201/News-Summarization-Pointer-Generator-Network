This isn't the first altercation Solo has had with police. Reports show police were called to a disturbance at her Kirkland home in the early hours on Nov. 12, 2012, with her then-boyfriend Jerramy Stevens (pictured with Solo in 2013) arrested pending domestic violence charges. Stevens was released and the couple were married the following day

'They entered and contacted several persons; one being Hope A Stevens (Solo) who appeared intoxicated and upset.'

Authorities said Solo's 17-year-old nephew and her sister had visible injuries.

'After receiving statements of the persons involved, Officers determined that Solo was the primary aggressor and had instigated the assault,' the report said.

Kirkland police Lt. Mike Murray said there was 'a big party going on at her house'.

'It was an out-of-control situation' Lt. Murray told The Times.

Solo was processed at the SCORE misdemeanor jail in South King County on on Saturday morning on two counts of investigation of domestic violence assault.

The sister has not been identified, however Solo has a half-sister named Terry.

This not Solo's first run-in with police for domestic violence.

In November 2012, Stevens, then her boyfriend, was arrested for allegedly assaulting Solo.

A stun gun was said to have been used to diffuse the situation.

Stevens,
 who played college football for the University of Washington, was 
released without charge because of insufficient evidence in the case.

Stevens and Solo were married the following day.

Solo's late father, Jeffrey Solo, had two children, Terry and David, before divorcing his wife.

He then remarried and had Hope and her brother, Marcus.

In her 2012 biography, Solo: A Memoir Of Hope, she wrote of her tumultuous family relationships.

'My family doesn't do happy endings,' Solo said in the book.

'We do sad endings or frustrating endings or no endings at all.

'We are hardwired to expect the next interruption or disappearance or broken promise.'

Solo's father was also arrested for kidnapping her and her brother when she was seven.

Her parents had divorced the year prior.

She has previously spoken about how her dad picked her and her brother from their home in Richland, Washington - where they lived with her mother, Judy - to go to a baseball game in a nearby town.

However Jeffrey Solo continued to drive to Seattle, where the three stayed in a hotel for several days.

Hope and her brother believed it was a vacation, until their father was arrested at a bank.

In her professional life, Solo has played on two gold-medal winning Olympic women’s teams and appeared Dancing With The Stars.

According to The New York Post, the Seattle Reign is scheduled to play on Sunday against the Western New York Flash in Rochester. 

'We are aware of the situation,' US Soccer said in a statement to the paper.

'At this point, we don’t have any further comments.'
