These young Bengal Tigers went from having a ferocious cat fight to a cat nap after tiring each other out in a heated battle.

With a swat of an enormous paw and a fearsome flash of teeth, this pair of young tigers were captured fighting tooth and claw at the Bandhavgarh National Park in India.

But despite appearing to be a serious battle, the teenage tigers were actually just flexing their muscles with a bit of playful posturing.

Me-ouch: The duo get precariously close to the edge of a lake as they snap and swipe at each other

Their play-fight saw them leaping and dancing around one another - batting out with their huge paws and even appearing to wrestle at one point.

The protracted tussle saw them go head-to-head on land, but their antics gradually drove them ever close to a nearby pool.

Eventually, the oblivious pair landed in it with a splash.

However, even that wasn't enough to cool their fun and they simply continued their fight in the water.

Eventually, however, the pair appeared to have worn themselves out.

They then flopped down on the bank of the pool side by side for a restorative snooze.
