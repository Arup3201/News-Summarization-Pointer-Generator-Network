Manslaughter charges against two men accused of killing a chef during a gay clingfilm bondage session have been dropped but they remain on trial accused of negligence.

Alun Williams, 47, died from a heart attack brought on by overheating and dehydration  after being wrapped up like a mummy in clingfilm and plastic sheeting in an extreme form of sadomasochism.

The P&O Ferries head chef, who lived with his girlfriend in Shepherdswell, Kent, had an interest in bondage and mummification and would meet men online for sex, Canterbury Crown Court heard.

Lesser charges: Richard Bowler, 35, (left) and David Connor, 23, (right) both of Canterbury, Kent, have had manslaughter charges against them in relation to the death of gay chef Alun Williams, but still face a lesser manslaughter by gross negligence charge

Richard Bowler, 35, and David Connor, 23, both of Canterbury, Kent, both denied manslaughter after he was found dead at the pair's flat in Dover, Kent, on August 20 last year.

And after hearing legal arguments Judge Adele Williams ruled the pair should only face the lesser charge of manslaughter by gross negligence.

The prosecution allege that having wrapped him in clingfilm they owed him 'a duty of care' but failed to take reasonable steps to ensure he was safe and well.

The jury has heard how Mr Williams had been friends with Bowler, who has cerebral palsy which affects his co-ordination and movement, for five years and had met for sex after using various gay websites. 

In August, Mr Williams went upstairs to Bowler’s flat above a hairdressers salon where he was bound in clingfilm and PVC and a hood.

Tests on Mr Williams, who had worked for P&O Ferries for 30 years, later revealed he had taken a cocktail of drugs including the horse tranquiliser ketamine.

The court has previously heard that he had lay dead for several hours before the pair realised what had happened.

Bowler, after making a phone call to his brother and texting his sister-in-law for help, phoned the police at 5.53am and told them he had been involved in a 'kinky sex session' with a friend who was wrapped up and had stopped breathing, the court heard.

He was put through to the ambulance service and told them that Mr Williams had taken the drug ketamine.

The jury was also played the 999 call made to the police by Bowler shortly before 6am.

He is heard telling the call handler: 'It's a bit embarrassing.

'It's my friend, he's called Alun. I have known him for five years.

'I'm gay, he's gay. We had a bit of a kinky sex game and he's stopped breathing.'

Discovery: Mr Williams was found dead at the pair's flat in Dover, Kent, on August 20 last year

Connor can be heard in the background as Bowler makes the call.

Bowler tells the operator: 'He's on my bed, he's wrapped up in a PVC sheet with tape and that.

'He's got clingfilm wrapped around his body and I have got a text message on my phone stating that's what he likes.'

The trial then heard Bowler's call after he was transferred to an ambulance service operator who told him how to carry out CPR.

When paramedics arrived they discovered the bed covered in black plastic and Bowler performing CPR on Mr Williams.

The trial has heard Connor, who worked as a live-in carer for Bowler, allegedly told police Bowler planned to fly abroad after realising Mr Williams had died.

He told police: 'I tried to calm Richard down. He was saying he wanted to kill himself, because of his self pity.

'Then he wanted to call up for tickets. I think he actually went onto his laptop to check out how much the tickets were as well.

Investigation: Police found drugs including ketamine, cocaine, methamphetamine and amyl nitrate, otherwise known as poppers, in Mr Williams' rucksack, the court was told

'I talked him out of not doing that as well. I think he said he wanted to fly to Malaga and also get some alcohol.'

Connor claimed he had been playing football at Sandwich earlier in the day and had returned to the flat.

He later admitted that he took part in wrapping Mr Williams in Clingfilm in the hope of earning some money.

Police found drugs including ketamine, cocaine, methamphetamine and amyl nitrate, otherwise known as poppers, in Mr Williams' rucksack, the court was told.

They also found a gas mask and ties in his bag, the court heard.

Sex toys, masking tape, duct tape, black plastic sheeting and cling film were also found in the flat, the jury heard.

A laptop found in Mr Williams' car showed he had an interest in bondage and mummification, the court heard.

A post-mortem examination on Mr Williams' body confirmed that he had died suddenly following body wrapping while under the influence of ketamine and methamphetamine.

The jury heard how despite having a female partner, Mr Williams enjoyed meetings 'for the purpose of gay sex'.

Bowler and Connor both deny the remaining charge against them. 

The defence case is expected to be heard tomorrow and the trial is expected to end next week.
