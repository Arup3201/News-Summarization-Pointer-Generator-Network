The father of a brother and sister killed in a deliberate fire at their flat has died in hospital, police said last night.

Eight-year-old Bridget Sharkey and her brother Thomas, 21, died after the blaze at their home in the early hours of last Sunday.

Their parents, Thomas Sharkey, 55, and Angela, 46, suffered serious burns and were taken to hospital.

Thomas Sharkey, 55, has passed away after he and his wife Angela, 46, suffered serious burns following a blaze at their family home last weekend

Police, who have launched a murder investigation involving 50 officers, confirmed that Mr Sharkey died in hospital yesterday morning.

The fire broke out in the living room of the family’s home in Helensburgh, Argyll and Bute, and quickly spread, trapping them.

Mr Sharkey had been seen hanging out of the window shouting for help.

His son was found dead at the scene and the rest of the family were taken to hospital where Bridget died a short time later.

The rest of the family were taken by ambulance to Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, Renfrewshire where Bridget died a short time later.

Thomas Sharkey, 55, and Angela, 46, suffered serious burns and smoke inhalation.

Mr Sharkey was told of his children's deaths on Tuesday although Angela remains sedated.

Fifty officers are involved in the investigation and yesterday, police set up an email address for information in a bid to catch the killers.

Tragedy: Thomas Sharkey, 21, and his eight-year-old sister Bridget, who were killed in a house fire in Helensburgh, near Glasgow. Police have now launched a murder investigation

Earlier this week Valerie McFadyen, Mr Sharkey's sister, read a statement on behalf of the family.

Speaking
at the town's police station, she said: 'The entire family have been 
left shattered, devastated and now angry by the deaths of our darling 
Bridget and Thomas.

'Golf 
was Thomas's life and all his family and friends aspired to be as good 
as he was. His smile lit up every room and he always found the best in 
everyone he met.

'We always thought he would be famous for his golf and not for the tragic way he died.'

Prior to Mr Sharkey's death Chief Inspector Fergus Byrne said: 'They will have to wake up and learn this dreadful news. My thoughts are very much with the family at this very difficult time.

'It's an absolutely dreadful and tragic event. Right now there is no clear motivation. We are looking at all aspects of the background of the people concerned to see if there is a motive there that perhaps could shed some light and point us to the people responsible.

'We have spoken to the wider family. They are aware of these dreadful circumstances and obviously that will be part of our ongoing inquiry.'

Eight-year-old Bridget is 
believed to have died after coming home from a planned sleepover because
she missed her parents.

The heat of the blaze caused a 
downstairs window to explode and left an area of severe scorching around
the front door of the property in Scott Court.

Thomas was in the
country after returning from the U.S. where he has a Golfing 
Scholarship at Georgia Southern University.

Parish
priest Father Peter Lennon, of St Joseph's Church in Helensburgh, said:
'It is dreadful. The wee girl was an absolute gem, the boy I didn't 
know as well because he was in America on this scholarship.

'She made her first Communion in May. She was like the other girls, when they were out playing she always had good fun.

'I didn't know the parents very well, but they came to church and were a good family.

'I have spoken to their relatives. They are just shocked.'

Father Lennon said he told his congregation yesterday morning.

He said: 'There was a deadly silence when I announced it. Most of them knew there had been a fire and most of them knew who had been involved, but to hear of the deaths was devastating. There was just silence.'

Thomas Sharkey won a golf scholarship
to Georgia Southern University in the U.S. after leaving Our 
Lady and Saint Patrick's High in Dumbarton in 2008.

In his biography on the Georgia 
Southern Eagles website, he described himself as 'ambitious and 
competitive', adding that his grandfather and father were the biggest 
influence on his athletics career for teaching him golf.

Thomas Sharkey was 'hard-working and conscientious' while his sister was 'beautiful, talented and enthusiastic', their headteacher said today.

Ann Chalmers, headteacher St Joseph's
primary school in Helensburgh, where both siblings were pupils, said: 
'We are absolutely devastated and saddened to hear Bridget and Thomas 
have died. Bridget was ready to start primary five in August. Bridget 
was a beautiful child, very talented, an excellent all-rounder and 
enthusiastic pupil who was a lovely singer, dancer and artist.

'Bridget was a very happy and popular girl. She will be sorely missed by all at St Joseph's primary.

'Thomas also attended St Joseph's for primary schooling. He was a great pupil, was very hardworking and conscientious.

'It
is so tragic to lose two fine young people who had everything to live 
for. Our thoughts and prayers are very much with them and their families
and friends.'

Strathclyde Police Area Commander, Chief Inspector Fergus Byrne, said a murder investigation had been launched.

'Extensive inquiries have been 
ongoing all day at the scene, including a full crime scene forensic 
investigation by forensic scientists, fire service and Strathclyde 
Police,' he said.

'This investigation is continuing, 
however, we believe that this fire was started intentionally and the 
deaths are now being treated as murder.'

Forensic investigation: A police officer stands guard near the property where the family died

Police said that post-mortem 
examinations will be carried out in due course to establish the exact 
cause of death but that the deaths are being treated as murder.

The officer in charge of the 
investigation, Detective Chief Inspector Anne McKerchar said: 'This is a
tragic event made worse by the fact that it was a deliberate act.'

One neighbour, who did not wish to be
named, said: "They had lived there a few years and were a nice normal 
family. It is terrible. It makes any problems the rest of us might have 
seem insignificant.'

A police helicopter was brought in to take aerial photographs while officers continued their investigations.

Crimestoppers has put up a £10,000 
reward for information which leads to the arrest and conviction of 
whoever committed the crime.

The email address for the investigation is operationendeavour@strathclyde.pnn.police.uk.

Officers
have also set up an additional phone number for the incident room. 
People can now call 01389 822 059 or 01389 822 162 to get through to the
investigation team.
