Draped in the blue velvet robes of the Order of the Garter and with a plumed hat in his hands, at first glance the Duke of Winsdsor looks every inch a king.

But in this extraordinary photograph – which has never been seen before - the silver-haired former Edward VIII is not posing in state in one of the royal palaces of Britain.

Instead, he stands squinting in the sun in the back garden of his French country house, replacing the ceremonial garter around his calf with a blue ribbon.

The Duke of Windsor poses in his Order of the Garter robes in a photograph that has never been seen before

This picture is part of a stash of three photo albums capturing  decades of the duke's life with wife Wallis Simpson, the Duchess of Windsor, which has remained hidden until now.

It appears in the new issue of Hello! magazine, along with earlier photographs from the albums, that are being published for the first time.

Filled with intimate shots up to the former king's death in 1972, the three albums  give a hitherto-unseen glimpse into Edward's life as Prince of Wales, King Edward VIII and then duke.

After the duke's death in 1972 they passed into the possession of his gardener, Henri Gay, 90, who said he had a close working relationship with his royal employer.

Mr Gay told the magazine: 'We shared a passion for gardening and nature that cut across the difference in our social backgrounds.'

The caption notes he was depicted as the Prince of Wales, and the picture is a water colour replica of an artist's oil painting which hung in the Guildhall Portsmouth measuring 9ft by 6ft

Mr Gay, who is retired and lives near Montpelier, was head gardener at Le Moulin de la Tuilerie, the Windsor's country retreat southwest of Paris, for seven years from 1966. 

He told Hello! that after the duke's death in 1972, the duchess gave him the photo albums  on her last visit to the house before it was sold - and she generously left him $10,000 in her will.

For him, the volumes initially held sentimental value but as the years passed he began to realise their historical significance.

The intimate snaps of the Duke of Windsor are in this issue of Hello! Magazine

The gardener, who worked for the couple with his wife Renee, said he was the photographer behind the picture of the older, silver-haired duke posing in the historic garb in front of, what looks like, a farm building.

Mr Gay said: 'On one occasion he called me over to take a picture of him in his robes. 

'It was in the garden where he had installed a mini-golf course. He loved mini-golf.' 

Interestingly, two parts of the official ceremonial robes are missing: he is not wearing the gold link-chain 'collar' and he has tied a blue ribbon around his leg rather than the official garter.

According to Hello!, the first album of the collection passed to Mr Gay, is labeled The Fort after the Duke's home in Windsor, Fort Belvedere and seems to track his growing passion for the thin, abrasive American woman, as she features in almost every shot. 

Other snaps capture Edward's brief time as king as well as a Mediterranean cruise he took with Wallis. 

The photos are just another glimpse into the life one of the most controversial royals who courted scandal with his fast-living set in the 1930s and refused to assume a life of duty when he became king.

In fact, on becoming king  20 January 193l, he caused a constitutional crisis just months into his reign by seeking to marry Wallis Simpson, an American socialite who had divorced one man and was trying to divorce another.

Preferring to marry Wallis, Edward abdicated after 326 days, becoming the shortest-reigning monarch in British history.

In an address to the nation, he said: 'I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as king as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love.' 

After his abdication, his younger brother Albert took the throne - and the name George VI - while his wife Elizabeth became queen, and their eldest daughter Elizabeth, first in line for the throne.

The newly-titled Duke of Windsor married Wallis in a private ceremony on 3 June, 1937, at Château de Candé near Tours, France.

The new king forbade any members of the royal family to attend the wedding and denied the Duchess of Windsor the styling of 'Her Royal Highness', which added to the strained relationship between the Windsors and the rest of the royals. 

Edward hoped to settle in Britain after a couple of years of exile in France but his brother George VI threatened to cut off his allowance if he returned to Britain without an invitation.

During the war, he was installed as the Governor of the Bahamas but afterwards he and the duchess returned to France where they spent the rest of their lives, becoming international socialites in Paris and New York.

While relaxing at Le Moulin, the only property the couple would own, Edward and Wallis hosted the biggest stars of the day including Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, Aristotle Onassis, Maria Callas, Marlene Dietrich and Cecil Beaton. 

The Duke and Duchess of Windsor and the era in which they lived continues to fascinate, with Madonna's film W.E focusing on the couple's love affair and the Oscar-winning King's Speech highlighting the relationship between his brother the Duke of York and then George VI and his speech therapist.

The Order of the Garter is the oldest British Order of Chivalry and was founded by Edward III in 1348.

It is said to have been founded when at a court ball, a lady lost one of her garters and King Edward bent down, picked it up and - amid blushes and laughter - tied it around his own leg with the remark: 'Honi soit qui mal y pense' which means, 'Shame on him who thinks this evil'.

The phrase is  now the Order's motto.

The Order consists of the monarch and 24 knights and honours men and women (permitted to join the order in 1987) who have served the nation or the sovereign. 

Members of the royal family are also permitted to join in addition to the 24 knights and include Prince Philip, Prince Charles, Princess Anne, Duke of York, Earl of Wessex and Duke of Cambridge.

St George is the order's patron saint and St George's Chapel, Windsor is its spiritual home.

The ceremonial robes have changed and evolved over the years but today the insignia includes the following items:
