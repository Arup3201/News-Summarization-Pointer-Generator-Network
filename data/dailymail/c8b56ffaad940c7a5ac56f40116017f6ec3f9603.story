A 14-year-old girl has miraculously survived after being struck by two fast-moving cars as she jaywalked across a busy California road.

Surveillance cameras above the intersection by Santa Ana College captured the shocking incident, which left the girl with leg injuries on Monday afternoon.

The youngster tried to cross multiple lanes at 17th and Bristol streets even though there was a red signal for pedestrians, and halfway across the road, she was hit by a red pickup truck.

Danger: A teenage girl is hit by a red truck as she crosses a busy intersection in Santa Ana on Monday

Struck: She then falls forward in front of a black Cadillac, which then hits her again and comes to a stop

The impact threw her into the path of a dark sedan, believed to be a black Cadillac, which then knocked her forward into the road as the traffic came to a stop.

The girl can be seen trying to stand before her legs crumple beneath her, according to footage released to KTLA on Tuesday.

The truck stopped further down the
 road but the driver returned to the vehicle and drove away, police 
said. A witnessed followed him from the scene and called police and he 
was arrested.

He was identified as 32-year-old Adan Camacho from Santa Ana and he was booked 
into jail for felony hit-and-run and driving without a valid license.

Hurt: The girl tries to walk but she collapses. She suffered leg injuries but has been released from hospital

The driver of the black Cadillac climbed out of the vehicle to help the girl collect her belongings.

Arrest: One of the drivers, Adan Camacho, was caught and charged with felony hit-and-run

But when officers arrived, the driver never identified herself as being involved and left the scene.

Police are now searching for this driver, who also faces felony hit-and-run charges.

'Had both drivers stayed at the scene, this would have been the 14-year-old's fault. She was responsible for what happened,' Santa Ana Police Department Cpl. Anthony Bertagna told KTLA.

'She crossed against the red … Obviously he didn’t see her. She jetted out in front of him.'

He added that they were hoping to identify the second driver.

'She actually picks up the victim's backpack and appears to be looking into her care, and then for whatever reason, she gets back into her car and leaves the scene without identifying herself as being involved in the accident,' Bertagna said.

'We’re hoping she'll come forward and we can straighten this out.'

Camacho is due in court Wednesday. The girl was released from hospital on Tuesday.
