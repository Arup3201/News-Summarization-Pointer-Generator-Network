Mo Farah is facing serious questions about pictures that have emerged of him alongside convicted doper Hamza Driouch.

The double Olympic champion features in a series of snaps posted on social media which appear to show him running alongside the banned former world junior 1500m champion in Ethiopia last month, and sharing a minibus back from training there. 

Qatari Driouch is serving a two-year ban that began on New Year’s Eve for irregularities in his biological passport and IAAF rules state banned athletes are prohibited from ‘participating in any capacity … in a training camp, exhibition or practice’.

Farah’s agent Ricky Simms told the Daily Telegraph: ‘Mo was in Ethiopia by himself. He hired some local athletes to pace for him during his workouts and he wasn’t part of any other training group. It’s not unusual for people to jump in. He has not got any association with any other athletes that may be out there.’

But Sportsmail has obtained pictures posted by Driouch on his Facebook page which appear to show him in a minibus with Farah and other athletes, and two of him training with Farah. Driouch's Instagram account was switched to private on Saturday morning.

Farah’s own Twitter account also has a picture posted on January 20 which appears to show them running together, and the IAAF are certain to want to find answers about why one of the world’s most high-profile athletes was training alongside a runner who is banned. 

Farah flew from Ethiopia to the UK to compete in Birmingham, where he broke the two-mile world record last weekend. He claimed he is feeling better than ever at this stage of the season and credits switching his training base from Kenya to higher altitude in Ethiopia.

‘I am definitely in the best shape of my life,’ he said.

Farah's agent Simms refused to comment when contacted by Sportsmail.
