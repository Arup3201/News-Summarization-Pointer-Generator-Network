Health authorities are running tests on five people who came in contact with a horse that died from the Hendra virus in northern NSW.

The 31-year-old stockhorse gelding died on Thursday night and the NSW Health Department has since confirmed the animal was infected with the deadly virus.

Authorities have quarantined the property, west of Murwillumbah on the state's north coast, to run tests on the horse's stablemates.

The horse was found in a dam earlier on Thursday and had been treated by a private veterinarian for very low body temperature prior to its death.

'Three people who handled the horse plus the veterinarian and an assistant are being assessed and monitored by NSW Health,' NSW deputy chief vet Therese Wright said.

It's the first case of Hendra discovered in NSW this year.

No horses have moved off the property in recent weeks and there are no dogs or cats about, according to Ms Wright.

The paddock where the horse was kept 'has regular flying fox activity'.

Horses are believed to contract the Hendra virus from feed contaminated by urine, saliva or birthing fluids from flying foxes.

'Do not place feed and water under trees and cover feed and water containers with a shelter so they cannot be contaminated from above,' Ms Wright said.

Hendra virus was found in four horses and a dog across four separate mid-north coast properties last year.

'Winter is the season when horses have been infected with Hendra in NSW in the past so now is the time to get a vaccine booster for your horse,' Ms Wright said.

In Queensland four people have been killed by Hendra virus since 1994.

In December, councils across the state were given permission to trim trees and use smoke, lights and loud noises to drive flying fox colonies away from urban areas without needing a permit.

'If a horse becomes sick, owners should contact their veterinarian immediately,' Ms Wright said.
