Companies are accessing people’s private health information through their smartphone apps, it is claimed.

The firms are harvesting information via popular health and fitness apps available in the UK including jogging app MapMyRun.

The apps are used by fitness fans to track their exercise sessions and record information such as running times.

Privacy problems: Many popular apps that record fitness levels are passing on information to insurance companies

Many will be unaware that their details are being passed on to companies including advertisers and digital analytic groups.

Research published yesterday suggests that that the 20 most visited apps transmit information to a web of nearly 70 companies.

The findings, by web analytics and privacy group Evidon, have been criticised by campaigners who said it presented a ‘stark warning’ to users of the apps.

Emma Carr of Big Brother Watch, said: ‘With some applications’ terms and conditions reading longer than a Shakespearean play, it is no wonder that the developers are able to hide behind small print and legal jargon.

‘If people don’t understand what is happening to their personal information, how are they supposed to make an informed choice about whether to use a service?

‘The developers of these sorts of applications are putting their own interests before the privacy of their users, highlighting that consumers need proper protection from terms and conditions that are either too intrusive or too unclear to understand.’

The study comes after another investigation found creators of smartphone apps were not explaining privacy risk to customers properly.

Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, an advocacy group, found ‘considerable privacy risks’ not described in privacy policies when they analysed 43 popular health and fitness apps.

The report read: ‘Consumers should not assume any of their data are private in the mobile app environment - even health data that they consider sensitive.’

The Evidon study found that information from MapMyRun, which allows joggers to record the length and pace of their running, is passed on to third parties.

Data was passed to 11 different firms, including advertising companies, some of which are subsidiaries of Google, and other digital analytics and tracking groups.

Experts are now warning that it may set a dangerous precedent and allow companies to use the information against people in future.

Risk: The research showed that very few customers understood their details were being passed on to third parties

If health and fitness information were to be passed to insurance companies, they could use it to set premium prices.

Leon Atkinson-Derman, chief executive of Winkpass Creations, maker of a menstrual cycle tracking app called iPeriod, said insurance companies were a real threat.

He told the Financial Times: ‘If an insurance company were to want to buy iPeriod, I’d say no.‘The fact of the matter is, insurance companies are trying to learn things about people and use it against them.’

MapMyFitness, another exercise app, already earns half of its revenue from partnerships with insurance companies and says it benefits its users.

It built a special platform for US-based company Humana, which mimics the fitness and calorie tracking features of MapMyFitness, the first of its kind for an insurance company.

Humana offers this to the members of its employee health plans. When users meet certain fitness benchmarks, they are offered discounts on premiums or certain employers offer rewards such as holidays.

Many of the app and third party companies say they do not sell information about their users and any user information transmitted is not personally identifiable.

They say information is more typically used to improve their own apps.

However, some companies, including iPeriod, are exploring ways of using personal data inputted into apps to target advertising at users.

For example, a woman who records in the app that she gets headaches before her period could soon receive an ad for a pain reliever at just the right time of the month.
