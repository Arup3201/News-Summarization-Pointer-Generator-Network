It's a feeling every Sunday League footballer knows - you watch a Premier League game and think 'I'm better than some of those players'.

Well now amateurs in the third tier of the Sunderland Sunday League have the chance to prove it, as they go up against former Sunderland and Middlesbrough midfielder Julio Arca.

Arca, 33, made his debut last weekend for The Willow Pond FC, scoring in a 2-2 draw against Hylton Road Carpets Elite. 

Big signing: The former professional made his debut for the Sunday League team last weekend

Experience: Arca played for Middlesbrough for seven years after six seasons with Sunderland

The Argentine ex-pro, who played twice for his country at U-20 level, retired from professional football in 2013 after over a decade playing in the North East, making more than 300 league appearances.

But he told the Middlesbrough Evening Gazette that after his retirement he missed the game, so he has started playing for fun.

'My routine changed a great deal when I stopped,' he said. 'Playing professionally is not something you forget in one day. I miss it.

'The lads asked me a couple of years ago if I would play for them when I retired and I always said I would.

Quality: The midfielder says it will take time for his new team to adapt to his playing style 

The midfielder enjoyed his debut, and the post-match drinks, but says it will take some time for his new teammates to adapt to his game. 

'Playing is great for me, it gets me out of the house. And I also enjoy a couple of drinks with the lads after the match.'

'It will take me a little while to get into it. The lads will also need a little time to get used to the way I play.'

In the meantime, it's a great chance for the sunday footballers of Sunderland to get one over on their former hero.

For the love of the game: Arca says he will enjoy playing with the team, and going for a drink afterwards
