Legal fight: Beth Warren arriving at the High Court today where she is arguing the destruction of her husband's sperm should be delayed

A grieving widow who needs more time to decide whether she wants her dead husband's baby is at the High Court today to stop his frozen sperm being destroyed.

Beth Warren, 26, will ask a judge to ignore a time limit imposed by the UK fertility regulator who says she must use Warren Brewer's sample to conceive by next April.

Before ski instructor Mr Brewer died of a brain tumour in February 2012 they agreed they wanted two children, so he had his sperm frozen for use after he was gone.

They married in a hospice six weeks before he died.

But unless the High Court agrees to them being kept for longer than usual, they will be destroyed in 14 months.

Ms Warren said coping with the 
personal trauma of the loss of her husband, and her brother in a car crash weeks later, made it impossible for her to make any 
decisions about her future within the timescale.

Her legal team will argue it should be extended 
so she can make a choice in her own time.

'I'm exhausted but it's 
not a fight I can give up - Warren said he wanted to give me this 
chance. I need to do this,' she said previously.

Mr Brewer had signed consent forms allowing the storage of his sperm so Ms Warren could conceive after his death, known as post-mortem conception, but on a time-limited basis after which the samples are set to be destroyed.

Mrs Warren, who took her husband’s Christian name as her surname after his death, wants to be financially secure before bringing a child into the world.

The physiotherapist from Birmingham said: ‘I am still trying to make myself happy again – you don’t have a child because you are lonely and heartbroken'.

Mrs Warren, who put her studies and career on hold to care for her dying husband, said: ‘We just fell head over heels in love. It was a long time ago that we made plans that when we are engaged and married we would have children.

‘Ideally we’d have a boy and a girl and we talked about names. I am just trying to do the right thing.’

Tough: Beth says when her husband Warren died her brother was killed weeks later, leaving her unable to take the decision about when to start a family

Argument: The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority says it has 'every sympathy' with Ms Warren but says that they have 'no discretion' over the timings

Mrs Warren added: 'I have the full support of Warren’s family in my legal battle and in whatever decision I make, and they have told me how proud they are of how I am dealing with the situation.'

The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) has said it has 'no discretion to extend the storage period beyond that to which her husband gave written consent'.

The issue will now be determined by family division judge Mrs Justice Hogg.

Jenni Richards QC, for Mrs Warren, told the judge that Mr Brewer had wanted to ensure that his sperm could be used by his wife after his death.

And she said Mrs Warren was not yet 'emotionally, physically or practically' ready to conceive.

'There is no ambiguity or lack of clarity about what Warren wanted,' said Ms Richards. 'His wishes and intentions are clear. He signed every form he was given to sign.'

And Mrs Warren, 28, told the court: 'I am sure there is absolutely no way he wanted to limit my choices in this situation.'

Mrs Warren, who uses her late husband's first name as her surname, added: 'All we knew was every form we were ever given we read and we filled in and we signed it. I found it quite confusing.'

Mrs Justice Hogg is due to hear arguments from lawyers representing the HFEA this afternoon.She said she would not make a decision today.

A woman who fought a similar legal fight nearly 20 years ago was in court to offer Mrs Warren support.

In the mid-1990s, Diane Blood, a 47-year-old writer from Worksop, Nottinghamshire, won the right to use her late husband's sperm to try for a child they had planned together before his sudden death from meningitis.

'Mrs Warren got in touch with me,' Mrs Blood, who has two sons aged 15 and 11, told journalists. 'I hope she wins.'
