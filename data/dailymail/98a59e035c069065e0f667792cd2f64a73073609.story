A Baltimore Orioles fan got an unexpected surprise when he stopped to help a motorist trapped in an overturned truck and realized the man helping him was one of his sporting idols.

Diehard Orioles fan Mike Soukup was driving southbound on the Baltimore-Washington Parkway on Monday afternoon when he saw the accident and decided to pull over and help.

Soukup, 55, started to help one man try to push the truck back on its wheels and after four or five others joined in they were able to get the truck upright.

When Soukup turned to congratulate the achievement with the man next to him - the one who was the first on the scene - he recognized him as Orioles corner infielder Chris Davis.

'I turned to high five the guy for a good job done getting this truck up, and I thought to myself, "Man, that looks like Chris Davis,"' Soukup told The Baltimore Sun. 

Davis received a 25-game suspension on Friday for a second failed drug test for an amphetamine that he later revealed was Adderall.

'When I said, "Chris?" and he said, "Yeah," back, he did it as if I was saying it to my best friend Bob,' said Soukup.

Soukup posted about the chance meeting with one of his sporting idols on his Facebook page

'He was a real nice guy. He talked to everybody. He talked to the EMTs. But he should wear the No. 19 all the time just so we can tell.' 

Medics transported three individuals to Maryland Shock Trauma Center and a 61-year-old man was transported to Shock Trauma with serious injuries that were not considered life threatening.

Soukup, a local musician who lives in Severn, also told Davis he thought he got 'screwed' by Major League Baseball, and he said Davis told him he appreciated his sentiment. 

'He’s pretty much my favorite Oriole. He seems to be a real nice humble guy who just happens to hit a ball really far. 

'I was supposed to make more stops on my way home, but I thought, I can’t. I’ve got to go home and tell my wife about this because my cell phone wasn’t working.' 

A spokesman for the Orioles confirmed that Davis was listed as a witness in a police report and signed a statement about what happened.
