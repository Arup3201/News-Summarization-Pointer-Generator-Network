An elderly couple is believed to have been killed after a house fire in the early hours of this morning.

Firefighters have confirmed that two people died in the blaze in Carlton, near Stockton-on-Tees, and neighbours say they believe the victims to be 'frail' pensioners.

The fire, which blew out the windows of the semi-detached property and melted guttering, was described by emergency workers as 'severe'.

Neighbours described being woken by the rescue operation with dozens of 999 vehicles on the scene.

The windows of the house were blown out in the fire which has been described as 'severe'

Police and fire officers have started an investigation to establish the cause of the blaze which broke out at 5am

The Teesside Gazette said the couple were elderly with one neighbour describing them as being 'frail'.

Phillip
Wall, 27, told the newspaper: 'I was woken up at about 5am. We thought 
the street was being evacuated for some reason there was so many 
emergency vehicles about.

'I've never seen a house fire before. It's a shock - something you don't think will happen.'

One witness described the house saying the windows at the back of the house had blown out.

A
pensioner living nearby said: 'It's very sad and upsetting. They were a
nice couple who had lived in the village a lot of years.'

A spokesman for Cleveland Fire Brigade said: 'There has been a severe fire and unfortunately two people have died.

'Five fire appliances from Stockton, Thornaby and Middlesbrough stations attended.

'We are still trying to locate the next of kin.'

Cleveland Fire Brigade and Cleveland Police, who also attended this morning, will conduct an investigation into the cause of the fire.

Cleveland Police would not confirm the gender of the pair and said the investigation was in its very early stages.

The smashed windows and melted guttering reveal just how fierce the fire was that killed the couple

The road has been closed off while emergency services deal with the clean-up operation

Pensioner Joan Richardson, who lives near the property, said the community would pull together.

She said: 'Everybody is quite shocked. You don't expect this in a small rural village. It is a very friendly village, everybody speaks to everybody, it is a good community.

'Everbody will pull together whatever the circumstances. People are very caring, it's a very good young community, there is a good cross section. I am amazed I didn't hear it it.'

The property is on Carlton Village Road facing The Smiths pub.

An employee at the pub, who declined to be named, said: 'I did video it. It was something big, there were lots of units here. It is right opposite the pub. It was about 5am, just before dawn.'
