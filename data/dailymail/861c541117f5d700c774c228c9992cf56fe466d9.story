A takeaway owner has been banned from running any food businesses after inspectors found his restaurant was caked in grime with mouse droppings on the kitchen table.

Council workers said Indian Ocean restaurant in Portsmouth had no hot running water, rotting food thrown into an outside yard, and pots kept on the floor next to rat poison.

The sink in the fast food outlet was covered in limescale, the utensils were not clean, and inspectors heard from one customer who saw a mouse running into the kitchen.

Disgusting: Mouse droppings are pictured on a shelf inside the Indian Ocean takeaway in Portsmouth, where a diner witnesses a live rodent running into the kitchen

Rotting: Food inspectors were called to the takeaway where they found no hot running water and food left to decompose in the yard outside (pictured)

Stomach churning: The owner of Indian Ocean was banned from running a food business for life after inspectors said the grime-caked walls showed no cleaning had been done for some time

Shocking pictures from behind the kitchen doors reveal chefs' aprons covered with dried food, a light switch blackened with dirt, and a filthy phone used for taking orders in the kitchen.

More pictures show the store room where some of the food was kept is cluttered and dirty, while there are mouse droppings on work surfaces and the floor.

Paul Fairley, prosecuting, said: 'The accumulation of food, dirt and debris made it quite clear to the inspector that no cleaning at all had been done for some time.

'Clearly there was a very real risk of cross-contamination.'

Punished: Matab Uddin, who appeared on behalf of the business in court, was fined £6,700 for multiple health and safety breaches (pictured, more rotting food and mouse droppings)

Blackened: This phone was used by chefs to take delivery orders, and was also located in the kitchen

Messy: The store room where sacks of rice were left together with cleaning implements. Pans were also found being stored on the floor next to rat poison

Takeaway co-director Matab Uddin appeared in court on behalf of the business and pleaded guilty to six counts of breaching health and safety laws.

Mr Uddin was fined more than £6,700 and given a hygiene prohibition order banning him from running any food business.

Cllr Robert New, cabinet member for environment and community safety, said: 'We want people to be able to go out and eat a meal without fearing that their health will be harmed.

Revolting: Chefs' whites covered with dried food are pictured hanging from a hook inside the grotty eatery

Grimy: Even the toilet inside the restaurant had not been property cleaned when inspectors paid their visit

The Indian Ocean takeaway has now been closed and the owner banned from running any food businesses

'We work with restaurants to help them achieve high standards, but if they put customers at risk like this we will not hesitate to take court action..'

Mr Uddin pleaded guilty to not maintaining premises in a clean condition, not maintaining premises in good repair and to having inadequate hand washing facilities.

He also admitted failing to put in place, implement and maintain food safety procedures.
