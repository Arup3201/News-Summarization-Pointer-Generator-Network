Dan Davidson was nicknamed the 'fat one' during his party years when he would knock back a bottle of vodka in a weekend.

The 26-year-old joiner would easily consume 6,000 calories in a day, while eating nothing but fast food and his weight shot up to 17st.

He knew things had to change when he went on holiday to Majorca and was too embarrassed to take off his top when he went swimming.

Dan Davidson from Grimsby went on a drastic fitness programme after being labelled The Fat One. He lost 24 per cent of his body fat in just a year and celebrated with a David-Beckham style underwear photoshoot 

To make matters worse, his girlfriend Rachel Brown, 30, was a  gym instructor with a toned physique.

Dan, from Grimsby, knew that the only way to match Rachel's figure was by completely transforming his life.

He gave up his alcohol binges and went from being overweight to a body builder in just over a year.

The father-of-two said: 'I still cannot believe how I have changed. 

'The key for me was giving up the booze, if I was on the lash, I would be eating all of the wrong things and bingeing on fast food. 

'I could easily get through 6,000 calories in a day and would drink a bottle of vodka over a weekend. 

Dan Davidson went from 17st to 14st with a vigorous gym routine and strict diet 

'I was still going to the gym during this time but it was making no difference to my body shape. 

'I had man boobs and hated the way I looked. 

'The low point for me was when a lass pointed at me and said I was, 'the fat one.'' 

That was the trigger which prompted Dan to get serious about fitness.

He changed his diet - swapping his favourite Coco Pops and takeaways for a high protein diet of grilled chicken and fish.

Dave combined his new diet and exercise with protein shakes to help bulk up muscle 

He also started taking Forza T5s - the supplements which helped Made In Chelsea star Spencer Matthews lose two stone  to get in shape for his Men's Health magazine cover.

Over the next year, Dan lost four stone - going from 17st to  13st.

His 'vodka belly' disappeared quickly as he lost six inches from his waist - down from 36in to 30in.

But the biggest change was in his body fat ratio - which went down from 30 per cent to 6 per cent.

After finally felt confident about his body, Dan bought a studio photoshoot where he posed in his underwear like David Beckham.

Dan's body transformation means that he finally feels comfortable alongside his gym instructor girlfriend Rachel Brown

He said: 'I loved posing for the pictures. A few people have joked that I look like Becks in his kecks. 

'I have worked so hard to get the body of my dreams and I don't see why I shouldn't celebrate that success.' 

Dan said taking the supplements had really helped him to lose weight.

He explained: 'They were the key to losing a lot of that fat including my man boobs. They really help you to burn calories more effectively by speeding up your metabolism.'
