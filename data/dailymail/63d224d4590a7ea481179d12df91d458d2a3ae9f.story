Meet the Brisbane-based drummer who rocks out on an incredible one of a kind drumset with 26 drums, 34 cymbals and 18 foot pedals, valued at $75,000.

Grant Collins, 45, uses the 80 piece drumset to compose his one man solo performances, describing his works sound like his 'very own orchestra'.

The master drummer uses both his hands and feet to play different parts, bringing out multiple voices from within the drumset to create an orchestral affect in his compositions.

Known for his One Man Percussion Orchestra, the show has seen him go global with tours and sell-out concerts through Europe, USA, Australia and Asia

After being told by his music teacher at the age of 10 that he was too old to start a career in drumming, Grant picked up a pair of sticks in his late teens and followed his passion, which led to his first paid professional gig on his 20th birthday in 1989.

One gig was all it took and Grant decided to quit his job and degree in computer programming to pursue his love of music and a life as a professional musician.

Grant has since traveled the world with his One Man Percussion Orchestra, with sell-out concerts through Europe, USA, Australia and Asia. He also teaches children in schools both here and overseas.

'I love sharing my passion for drums with kids and showing them how much fun drumming can be regardless of age or skill level,' he said.

During his school workshops, Grant shows students the techniques of drumming, by performing works from his solo repertoire and getting them involved in a very practical way.

'You're never too old to start an instrument and you don't have to do it at a professional level to enjoy it,' he said.

'If you have the love and passion, you can easily pick up a guitar for example and play three chords, it all goes from there.'

Grant graduated on Thursday with a Doctorate of Musical Arts from the Queensland Conservatorium Griffith University and is hoping to use his doctorate award to share his passion of drumming at a university level.

His broad influences come from a vast array of styles including jazz, country, rock, Latin and classical music's, just to name a few.

Despite all of his musical achievements, Grant said his biggest accomplishment by far is being a parent with his wife Jen to their 11-month-old son, Jax

Grant uses all four limbs when he plays and he sees the drumset as capable of more than just an accommpanying instrument for a rock band.

Through his hard work, practice, passion and successful solo concerts around the globe, Grant has changed the stereotypical views on drumming.

'There are so many misconceptions about the drums, but they have incredible potential to captivate audiences on a world stage as a contemporary solo instrument,' he said.

'Not everyone has had an opportunity to experience or understand the concept of solo drumming and the different sounds that can be generated from the instrument'.

Grant's passion lies in pushing the boundaries of solo performance on the drumset and creating ground breaking compositional works.
