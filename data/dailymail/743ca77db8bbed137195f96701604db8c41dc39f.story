The territorial dispute between China and Japan over the East China Sea 
Islands escalated today as two Chinese patrol ships arrived near the 
islands known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China.

The Beijing-sent vessels are a display of China’s outrage over Tokyo's 
£16.4m purchase of the largely barren islands from their private owners last week.

The quarrel over the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands, which are also claimed by 
Taiwan,
has been heating up in recent months after the governor of Tokyo 
proposed buying the islands and developing them.

Senkaku or Diaoyu: The islands in the East China Sea have long been the centre of a dispute between China and Japan which has escalated after the latter's purchase this week

Swift response: In reaction to the news of the Japanese central government's £16.4m purchase of the largely barren islands from their private owner, Beijing sent two patrol boats to the area

But Japan's central government announced its own deal this week with the
Japanese family it recognizes as the owner.

Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Osamu Fujimura told reporters the government budgeted 2.05 billion yen 
(£16.4 million) for the purchase ‘to maintain the Senkakus peacefully 
and stably.’

The central government does not plan to develop the islands, going against Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara’s plans.

‘Ishihara put the national government in a very difficult spot. He 
pushed them into doing this now,’ said Sheila Smith, a senior fellow at 
the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington.

But she said this was a ‘good outcome’ as Japan cannot afford to let the
dispute hinder its vital ties with China, its top trading partner.

Ms Smith said Tokyo needs to be able to work through problems with Beijing in order to maintain that trade serves both nations

But Beijing sees the purchase as an affront to its claims and its past 
calls for negotiations and, despite Tokyo’s attempts to calm the dispute, responded with fury.

‘The determination and the will of the Chinese government and military 
to safeguard their territorial integrity are firm,’ Chinese Defense 
Ministry spokesman Geng Yansheng said in a statement.

‘We are closely 
monitoring the development of the situation and reserve the right to 
take necessary measures.’

Carlyle Thayer, an expert on regional security at the University of New 
South Wales in Australia, said the sending of the Chinese patrol boats 
‘ups the stakes’ although it is unlikely that the Chinese boats would go
within the 12 nautical miles around the islands that are considered Japanese territorial waters.

‘It's a tit-for-tat response because China is extremely sensitive about sovereignty matters,’ he said.

Japan's coast guard said it has not taken any special measures in 
response to the Chinese patrol boats although it continues to monitor 
the situation.

'Japan has a pretty robust navy, a very strong and active professional 
coast guard. It's all posturing. It's a game of who blinks first,’ 
Thayer said.

Beijing's anger has been accompanied by heated reporting in China's 
state media with a commentator in the People's Liberation Army 
Daily called Japan's move ‘the 
most blatant challenge to China's sovereignty since the end of World War
II.’

China on Tuesday also started broadcasting a daily marine weather 
report for the islands.

About a dozen protesters gathered outside the Japanese Embassy in Beijing chanting, ’Japan, get out of China.’

The protests have spread, with a number of people waving placards and 
the Chinese flag and shouted ‘Defend the Diaoyu Islands’ outside the 
Japanese Consulate General in southern Guangzhou and about 200 people 
marched in Weihai in Shandong province, singing the national anthem, 
local media reported.

Top Japanese government officials maintain that the flare-up hasn't 
affected official ties with China, although Deputy Prime Minister 
Katsuya Okada acknowledged that emotions on both sides were being fanned
by activists.

China also has announced coordinates marking out the waters off the Diaoyu Islands that it considers its territory.

The coordinates are another step, along with recent announcements of 
China's intention to use law enforcement vessels, to defend its 
sovereignty claim, said Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, northeast Asia 
project director for the International Crisis Group.

‘It's primarily about being seen as taking action to pave the way for further actions to assert China's sovereignty,’ she said.

In Tokyo, Gov. Ishihara renewed his calls for the islands to be developed for future use by fishermen.

‘It appears that the matter is decided,‘ he told reporters. ‘They say 
they won't do anything, but China's leaders are still criticizing the 
plan."

Ishihara said he was freezing the 1.4 billion yen (£11.2 million) 
donated toward his purchase plan for the islands and would only release 
the funds to the government once it was clear whether a port or other 
facilities would be built.

He also suggested that Japan cooperate with the Philippines and Vietnam,
which also have disputes with China in the South China Sea.

‘We shouldn't see this as an issue that only concerns Japan,’ he said.

Japan has claimed the islands since 1895. The U.S. took jurisdiction after World War II and turned them over to Japan in 1972.
