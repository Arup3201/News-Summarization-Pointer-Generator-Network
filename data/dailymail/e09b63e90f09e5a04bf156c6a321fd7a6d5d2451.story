France’s First Lady is consumed by a 
‘thirst for revenge’ against Francois Hollande’s former partner which 
the president is unable to contain, an author claims.

In a devastating book, Valerie 
Trierweiler is portrayed as an emotional woman who relies on alcohol to 
steady herself for public appearances.

She earned the nickname The 
Rottweiler earlier this year when she tweeted her support for a 
candidate running for election against Segolene Royal, Mr Hollande’s ex.

Miss Royal, the mother of Mr Hollande’s four children, described the message as a ‘poisonous stab in the back’.

However, Miss Trierweiler, 47, a 
journalist with Paris Match magazine, is still looking for revenge after
Miss Royal warned her off the French president  when she learned of 
their affair in 2005.

Miss Royal, a senior Socialist Party 
politician at the time, allegedly called the reporter into her office 
and said: ‘Everyone says you are Francois’s mistress – it is unbearable
for me.’

She then tried to get Miss 
Trierweiler sacked from her job covering the Socialists, so the 
journalist would not have any excuse to approach Mr Hollande.

But Miss Trierweiler ignored the 
plea, and continued the affair until Mr Hollande and Miss Royal 
officially split after 30 years together in 2007.

The book, Entre Deux Feux (Between 
Two Fires), by investigative journalists Anne Rosencher and Anna Cabana,
confirms that President Hollande’s messy love life was almost 
impossible to manage.

At one point in 2007 he even 
considered trying to get back together with Miss Royal while she was 
running for the French presidency.

Miss Cabana said Miss Trierweiler’s 
tweet supporting Olivier Falorni over Miss Royal in parliamentary 
elections earlier this year was the ‘umpteenth act in a drama which has 
been going on for ten years’.

‘Valerie Trierweiler suffered in the shadows and was in fear of Segolene Royal, who threatened her professionally – she tried to get her fired – and personally.

‘Until the summer of 2007, Hollande floated between the two women. Today (Miss Trierweiler) has won but the thirst for revenge continues. The tweet is a symptom of this.’

Although Mr Hollande’s own ‘psychodrama’ love triangle has  already spawned three books, Entre Deux Feux is seen by many as the best sourced, with contacts at the heart of the French presidency.

Miss Trierweiler is depicted throughout as a nervous, paranoid woman who, on the advice of a friend, drinks at least half a glass of wine before public appearances.

Former conservative minister Rachida Dati also points out that Nicolas Sarkozy always held his wife’s hand in public, whereas Mr Hollande barely touches Miss Trierweiler.

If Miss Trierweiler did not feel as though she was getting enough attention from the president she would ‘dramatically disappear’, with Mr Hollande continually asking: ‘Where’s Valerie?’, says the book.

It also reveals the infamous tweet was sent from her Elysee Palace office after she argued with Mr Hollande because he wanted to give Miss Royal a job in his government.

The book even claims the journalist has ‘banned’ Mr Hollande from making Miss Royal a minister.

Miss Trierweiler has kept a low profile in recent weeks, carrying out few duties and making no public statements.
