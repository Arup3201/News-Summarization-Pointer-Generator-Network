After years of innuendo, speculation and accusations, Lance Armstrong is to take the route of many a disgraced public figure and offer himself up for a no-holds-barred interview with Oprah Winfrey.

A special 90-minute episode of 'Oprah's Next Chapter' will air on January 17th on Winfrey's OWN network and it is widely expected Armstrong, 41, will give an emotional account of the alleged doping scandal and use of performance enhancing drugs that has ruined his once glittering career.

The timing of the interview at his home in Austin, Texas will raise eyebrows as it comes just days after reports suggested that the cyclist is considering admitting publicly that he consistently cheated throughout his decade at the top of his sport in which he became a hero to millions.

Lance Armstrong speaking with Oprah Winfrey in 2005 - The one time cycling legend is to give his first ever no-hold-barred interview with the chat-show queen on January 17th

According to a release posted on 
Oprah's website on Tuesday, it's the first interview with Armstrong 
since his athletic career crumbled under the weight of a massive report 
by USADA detailing allegations of drug use by the famous cyclist and 
teammates on his U.S. Postal Service teams.

It's
unclear if the interview at Armstrong's home in Austin, Texas, has 
already been taped. Nicole Nichols, a spokeswoman for Oprah Winfrey 
Network & Harpo Studios, declined comment.

Armstrong
has strongly denied the doping charges that led to him being stripped 
of his seven Tour de France titles, but The New York Times reported 
Friday he has told associates he is considering admitting the use of 
PEDS.

The newspaper report 
cited anonymous sources, and Armstrong attorney Tim Herman told The 
Associated Press that night that he had no knowledge of Armstrong 
considering a confession.

Earlier
Tuesday, '60 Minutes Sports' reported the head of the U.S. Anti-Doping 
Agency told the show a representative for Armstrong offered the agency a
'donation' in excess of $150,000 several years before an investigation 
by the organization led to the loss of Armstrong's Tour de France 
titles.

In an interview for
the premiere airing on Showtime on Wednesday night, USADA CEO Travis 
Tygart said he was 'stunned' when he received the offer in 2004.

Lance Armstrong has agreed to a tell-all interview with Oprah Winfrey where he will address allegations that he used performance-enhancing drugs during his cycling career

'It was a clear conflict of interest for USADA,' Tygart said. 'We had no hesitation in rejecting that offer.'

Herman denied such an offer was made.

'No truth to that story,' Herman wrote Tuesday in an email to the AP. 'First Lance heard of it was today. He never made any such contribution or suggestion.'

Tygart was traveling and did not respond to requests from the AP for comment. USADA spokeswoman Annie Skinner said Tygart's comments from the interview were accurate.

In it, he reiterates what he told the AP last fall: That he was surprised when federal investigators abruptly shut down their two-year probe into Armstrong and his business dealings, then refused to share any of the evidence they had gathered.

'You'll have to ask the feds why they shut down,' Tygart told the AP. 'They enforce federal criminal laws. We enforce sports anti-doping violations. They're totally separate. We've done our job.'

Lance Armstrong is expected to deliver candid and clear comments on the allegations of performance enhancing drug use that have dogged his entire career and subsequent retirement

This dramatic news comes just two days after it was reported that Armstrong may be considering a change in course, dropping his years of denials and admitting that he used performance-enhancing drugs - even though such a move might be unwise.

The New York Times, citing anonymous sources, reported late Friday that Armstrong has told associates he is thinking about the move.

However, Armstrong attorney Tim Herman says that the cyclist hasn't reached out to USADA chief executive Travis Tygart and David Howman, director general of the World Anti-Doping Agency.

A USADA spokeswoman declined comment on Saturday, while Howman was quoted by the Sunday Star-Times in New Zealand, where he is vacationing, saying Armstrong has not approached his group.

Armstrong's attorney, Tim Herman, denied such an offer was made, saying: 'No truth to that story. First Lance heard of it was today. He never made any such contribution or suggestion'

USADA stripped Armstrong of his seven 
Tour de France titles last year and issued a report portraying the 
cyclist as the leader of a sophisticated doping operation on his winning
teams.

Public confessions and apologies have been the route of redemption for several athletes who have gotten in trouble.

For example, Tiger Woods said he was 
sorry for cheating on his wife in televised speech, and baseball slugger
Mark McGwire eventually admitted to steroid use. Yet Armstrong faces 
serious legal entanglements those megastars didn't, and a confession to 
doping could end up complicating matters for Armstrong - not making them
easier.

The U.S. Department of Justice is 
considering whether to join a federal whistle-blower lawsuit filed by 
former Armstrong teammate Floyd Landis alleging fraud against the U.S. 
Postal Service during the years the agency sponsored Armstrong's teams.

A Dallas-based promotions company has 
also said it wants to recover several million dollars paid to Armstrong 
in bonuses for winning the Tour de France. And the British newspaper The
Sunday Times is suing to recover about $500,000 paid to Armstrong to 
settle a libel lawsuit.

Despite damning evidence Armstrong has yet to admit any wrongdoing although that could be about to change

Armstrong has testified under oath 
that he never used performance-enhancing drugs, which could 
theoretically lead to charges if he confessed. Former U.S. track star 
Marion Jones spent several months in federal prison for lying to 
investigators about her drug use.

And after so many years of vehement 
denials and sworn statements that he never doped, at this point, what 
would Armstrong gain from a confession? There would be no guarantee that
his personal sponsors would return or that the public would accept it.

Is the public even interested in an Amrstrong confession?

Gene Grabowski, executive vice 
president of Levick, a Washington, D.C.-based crisis and issues 
management firm, said 'it may be too little, too late because he's been 
denying it for so long.'

A confession would only work to 
salvage Armstrong's reputation if he accepted full responsibility and 
blamed no one else, Grabowski said. And it would have to include some 
public act of atonement.

'If he does all three, he has a shot,' Grabowski said. 'You have to show people you are willing to pay a price.'

The New York Times reported the 
41-year-old Armstrong may be considering a confession in an attempt to 
reduce his lifetime ban from cycling and Olympic sport so he can return 
to competing in triathlons and elite running events.

Armstrong lost most of his personal 
sponsorship worth tens of millions of dollars after USADA issued its 
report and he left the board of the Livestrong cancer-fighting charity 
he founded in 1997. He is still worth about a reported $100 million.

Livestrong might be one reason to 
issue an apology. The charity supports cancer patients and still faces 
an image problem because of its association with its famous founder.

And if Armstrong did confess, the corporate sponsors who abandoned him might support him again, Grabowski said.

More allegations: The chief of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency said that a representative for Armstrong offered the agency in excess of $150,000 several years before the doping investigation

Armstrong was accused last October of running 'the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen'

'They'll do what the public does,' Grabowski said.

Betsy Andreu, the wife of former 
Armstrong teammate Frankie Andreu, was one of the first to publicly 
accuse Armstrong of using performance-enhancing drugs.

She dismissed a potential confession from Armstrong as self-serving and too late.

'Sorry, your chance is over. You're 
banned for life. It's not with an asterisk, that because you are Lance 
Armstrong you get to come back,' Andreu said. 'He does not belong in 
sport.'

According to the code, an athlete might be eligible for a reduced punishment if he fully confesses and details how he doped, who helped him dope and how he got away with doping.

Armstrong has been keeping a low profile since doping revelations ruined his once illustrious career and reputation.

In November he was spotted canoeing in the warm Pacific waters just off Hawaii. The holiday island has become a regular destination for Armstrong to seek refuge, as he throws himself into training for Ironman Triathlon events.

An Ironman Triathlon consists of a 
2.4-mile swim, a 112-mile bicycle ride and a marathon 26.2-mile run, 
raced in that order and without a break. Most Ironman events have a 
strict time limit of 17 hours to complete the race.
