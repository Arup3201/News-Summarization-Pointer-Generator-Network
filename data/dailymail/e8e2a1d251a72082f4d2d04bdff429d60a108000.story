This towering castle is fit for a tiny king or queen.

With a height of 39ft, the sandcastle designed by American artist Rusty Croft is vying for the world record for the tallest one ever built.

It took nearly a week to construct the castle – using 20 truckloads of sand – in the Brazilian city of Niteroi, across the Guanabara Bay from Rio de Janeiro.

It took nearly a week and 20 truckloads of sand to construct the castle, which has incredible detail

With elaborate detail the massive beach sculpture puts  the tiny sandcastles that most holidaymakers build when they’re sunning on a beach to shame.

A team from Guinness World Records is visiting the statue to measure it and confirm whether it is a record breaker.

After it is measured, the sandcastle, built from special material that can withstand winds and rain, will be destroyed. 

After it is measured the sandcastle will be destroyed on a beach in the Brazilian city of Niteroi

Impressive scenery: Rio de Janeiro's Christ the Redeemer is visible in the background

Mr Croft, who builds sandcastles around the world, constructed this palace with the support of two American companies looking to promote their brands in Brazil.

His professional career began in 1997 when he was part of a team that created the record-setting Lost City of Atlantis sand sculpture.

He is now a co-owner of California-based Sand Guys, which is hired to create sand sculptures for the likes of Yahoo!, Google, Facebook and other companies.
