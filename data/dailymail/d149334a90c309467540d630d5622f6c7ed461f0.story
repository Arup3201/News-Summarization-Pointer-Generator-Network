With a slender waist and curves in all the right places, Marilyn Monroe’s physique has long been coveted by women – and admired by men.

But it seems the classic hourglass figure that the star epitomised could be on borrowed time.

The waist size of the average British woman has increased by more than seven inches since the 1950s, research has found, giving her more in common with a rectangle than an hourglass.

Marilyn Monroe's physique has long been coveted by women - and admired by men. But it seems the classic hourglass figure that the star epitomised could be on borrowed time

Christina Hendricks is famed for her curvy hourglass physique, but British women are getting further and further away from this ideal, with waist sizes increasing by 7in since the 1950s

The hourglass figures of Man Men characters January Jones, left, Elisabeth Moss, centre, and Christina Hendricks, right, are now largely a thing of the past in the UK, with waist sizes ever increasing

For a perfect hourglass figure, a 
woman’s hip and bust must be of equal size, with a narrow tapered waist.
But a study has found that this shape is becoming increasingly rare.

In 1951, the average woman’s waist was 27 inches, with her bust and hips around ten inches larger.

But researchers who surveyed 5,500 
women found the average waist now measures 34 inches. Hip and bust 
dimensions, meanwhile, have grown by only an inch, leaving them just 
four inches larger than the waist.

As a result, almost half of British 
women are now classed as a ‘rectangle’ – with little difference between 
bust, waist and hip measurements.

The data compiled for women's sizes 
showed that while the average waist size has increased by more than 25 
percent, women's hips and busts haven't seen increases on the same scale.

This
has led to a change in women's figures from svelte hourglass to a 
more rotund, stout shape. -  and 38 per cent of women in Britain being classed as overweight.

Women
in the UK now weigh 7.5 lbs more than they did in 1951 - and even though 
they are 1.5in taller this still shows a general trend to higher 
BMI and greater levels of obesity nowadays.

Audrey Hepburn had a figure typical of the 1950s, while Kelly Brook has a body typical of 2013

The changing shape of British women: As well as larger wasitlines they have grown by 1.5in and are an average of 7.5lb heavier than women in 1951

Since Mad Men season six - a series 
based on the 1960s world of advertising - premiered on 7 April, one 
Harley Street clinic has reported a 40 per cent increased interest in 
body-sculpting waistline-reduction treatments from women wishing to 
emulate Hendricks' shape.

Donnamarie McBride, beauty director at LoveLite, said:
'Our most popular treatment with our Lipoglaze system is the "Mad Men 
waistline" and since the show came back on to TV we've been inundated 
with bookings.

'The reason why it's in such demand is because the waistline is one of the hardest areas to shift weight.

'Even with regular work-outs and a good diet this is often the last area that a women will lose fatty tissue.'
