Hero: Watersports instructor Charlie Toogood brought a runaway speedboat under control in Padstow and saved the lives of four members of a family

The 'hero' watersports instructor who risked his life by leaping on to an out of control speedboat that killed a father and daughter was revealed as an experienced former RNLI lifeboat volunteer today.

Charlie Toogood, 32, jumped from his own rib into the £60,000 vessel which had thrown the six members of the Milligan 
family into the Camel estuary on Sunday - leaving two of them dead and two 
severely injured.

He and a friend sped to the rescue in another boat after seeing them in the sea off Padstow in Cornwall.

They drew level with the stricken vessel as it raced round in circles, allowing Mr Toogood to jump into it.

He then managed to stop the engine and halt the boat.

Charlie was an RNLI crew volunteer at Rock lifeboat station for eight 
years - and only finished two years ago because of business commitments.

He is a married father of a five-month-old daughter and runs the Camel Ski School, 
which rents out equipment for Cornish holidaymakers.

Today he spoke about the incident for the first time, and said that it was important to remember the those who died or were hurt in the tragedy.

'There were many "heroes" in this tragic incident, all of whom did a remarkable job in difficult circumstances,' he said in a statement through the RNLI.

'However, now is a time to solely reflect on the bereaved and injured family members and their wider family and friends.

'My thoughts are with them all and will be for a long time to come.

'I have nothing more to add and would hope that our community can now be
left to deal with this tragedy in own own way and in peace and quiet.'

Sky TV executive Nick Milligan, 51, and his eight-year-old daughter Emily were killed after they were run over by the out-of-control vessel.

His yoga-teacher wife Victoria, 41, and their four-year-old son Kit both face losing their legs from 'life-changing' wounds caused by the £60,000 craft's propeller.

The couple's other children Olivia, 10, and Amber 12, are in hospital after being injured when they were thrown from their boat and hit.

Aftermath: An amateur video showing the empty speedboat out of control at Padstow shortly after the fatal incident

Danger: The boat was completely out of control following the incident in Padstow, Cornwall, on Bank Holiday Sunday

Bravery: The video, filmed from the shore, shows Mr Toogood jumping on to the speedboat

Meanwhile the Milligan family are 'as well as can be hoped', Nick's elder 
brother said today.

Mark Milligan spoke briefly outside the family home in London this afternoon.

'The investigation is on going. The family is doing as well as they can,' the 53-year-old said.

Asked about the condition of Mr Milligan’s wife Victoria and son Kit, Mr Milligan said: 'They are still being treated.

'I’ve seen the children, they’re all doing as well as you can hope for'.

He added that 'Lots of people have been very understanding' when asked about the support offered to the family.

He said he was at his brother’s detached house situated next to Wandsworth Common, 'to handle (his brother’s) affairs'.

Instructor: Mr Toogood, 32, intervened to prevent further disaster after the speedboat killed two people

Experienced: Mr Toogood runs his own business hiring out boats to holidaymakers in Cornwall

Mr Toogood's actions are credited with saving the lives of Nick Milligan’s remaining family, with police and coastguards having
praised Mr Toogood’s ‘incredible seamanship and bravery’ which prevented
further tragedy during the horrifying accident.

Matt Pavitt, from the North Cornwall Coastguard, said: ‘He managed to manoeuvre his boat alongside the vessel which was going round and round in circles, picked his moment and jumped.’

Detective Superintendent Jim Colwell added: ‘Without the brave and heroic efforts of local people and holidaymakers in the minutes immediately after this incident in assisting the family while they were in the water, I’m confident that this would have been far worse in terms of the overall death toll.’ 

Mr Toogood, a married father in his early 30s, had last night declined to talk about his heroics but his mother Sarah said he was ‘in a bit of a state’.

Another friend added: ‘He is devastated. Everyone is rightly calling  him a hero, but he felt he was helpless that he couldn’t do more to save the others.’ 

Teenager Will Jones was named as the helmsman of Mr Toogood’s boat. His sister Amy said: ‘My brother is still very shaken up from it all.’

Hundreds
of holidaymakers watched in horror as the speedboat then raced round in
circles, its propeller slashing the helpless victims and turning the 
water 'red with blood'.

Mr Jones, 19, later wrote on Facebook: 'After today the next few days are going to be very difficult to process. Thoughts are with those who are involved in the accident.'

Maria Chase wrote on Facebook: 'We 
were down in Padstow today and saw the tragedy and saw a hero who saved 
more lives by jumping on to an out-of-control speedboat from another 
boat.

'He deserves a medal, whoever he was.'

Another, Charlotte Jacobs, wrote to 
the RNLI on Twitter: 'We witnessed incredible bravery in Padstow today 
during the tragic accident that unfolded. The men involved deserve 
medals.'
