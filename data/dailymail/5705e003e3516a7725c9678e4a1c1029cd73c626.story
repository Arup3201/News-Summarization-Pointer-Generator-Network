Two years after a devastating earthquake, Haiti is struggling to rebuild its ravaged buildings and hundreds of thousands of victims remain homeless.

The 7.0 magnitude quake on January 12, 2010, lasted only a few seconds but killed around 300,000 people and left more than 1.5million without homes.

Since then, however, reconstruction has been painfully slow, with squalid tent camps housing more than a half a million people in the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince.

As it was: The stunning structure before the disaster

As the country holds solemn 
ceremonies at massive grave sites to remember the dead from Haiti's 
worst-ever natural disaster, President Michel Martelly has vowed to 
redouble government efforts to help people rebuild their lives.

'This
year is a year when we will really start rebuilding physically but also
rebuilding the hope and the future of the Haitian people,' he said.

He
also announced new efforts backed by the Canadian government to 
relocate some 20,000 people from tent encampments only blocks from the 
still crumpled presidential palace.

Canada said it was contributing $20million to the relocation effort in one of the world's poorest countries.

In
the first event of Thursday's remembrance, Martelly plans to inaugurate
a new university donated by Haiti's neighbour, the Dominican 
Republic.

Located
near the two countries' shared border, the Roi Henri Christophe 
University will be one of Haiti's biggest buildings and Martelly hopes 
the event will send a signal the country is taking steps forward.  He is attending Thursday's opening with former U.S. President Bill Clinton, a UN Special Envoy to Haiti.

Clean up: While this street has been partially cleared of debris, only half of the roads on Port au Prince have been cleared of concrete, steel and other debris

Services throughout the deeply religious country saw women in white dresses and men in dark suits walking to church through streets which were unusually quiet on what is a national holiday of remembrance.

Memorial services were planned at a UN base and the site north of the capital where thousands of quake victims are buried.

Despite billions of dollars of international donations and aid pledges, many Haitians say they see few tangible results of the recovery and reconstruction effort.          

Just over half of the piles of concrete, steel and other debris littering the capital of Port-au-Prince and its surrounding areas has been cleared.

This is in stark contrast to the regions of Japan struck by last year's devastating tsunami.

Just six months after the huge wave struck, many areas had been totally cleared of all debris and were ready for rebuilding of homes and shops.

Haitians, meanwhile, also complain about a lack of housing and jobs two years after the quake.

Overseas disability charity CBM  says that for hundreds of thousands of Haitians the earthquake still dictates their lives: living in temporary shelters, they are 'unemployed and, above all, are marked by the 
physical and psychological consequences of the disaster'. 

Government officials point to post-quake projects such as a $257million industrial park being built on Haiti's northwest coast and a program to stimulate agriculture production as evidence some progress is being made. 

Contrast: The town of Onagawa, in the Japanese region of Miyagi, was devastated by the tsunami which struck in March 2011 (top picture).  Yet six months later the entire area had been cleared of rubble and was ready for rebuilding
