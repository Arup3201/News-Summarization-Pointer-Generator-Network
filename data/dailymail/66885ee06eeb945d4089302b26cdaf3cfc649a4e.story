Influential: Jimmy Wales, co-founder of Wikipedia, has been asked to take on an unpaid role advising civil servants

One of the co-founders of Wikipedia has been asked to advise the Government on how Whitehall can make policy decisions more transparent, it emerged today.

Jimmy Wales, 45, will become an unpaid adviser across all government departments, helping civil servants develop 'innovative' new technology.

Mr Wales is expected to also advise civil servants on how the public can be better engaged through the internet as part of 'open government' initiatives.

Mr Wales co-founded Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia that can be edited by anyone, in 2001 with philosopher Larry Sanger.

According to the latest figures, Wikipedia is now the world's sixth-most visited website, with more than 400milllion people viewing it every month.

A Whitehall source told the Daily Telegraph last night that Mr Wales was one of a number of unpaid advisers being brought into advise civil servants.

The Florida-based former futures trader will 'help to deliver new ways that we can (harness) the internet and technology' the source added.

It is unclear how long he will be an advising civil servants for, or who appointed him to the role.

The announcement of the advisory role for Mr Wales follows several online 'crowdsourcing' initiatives launched by the Tory-Lib Dem coalition.

Not long after taking office, ministers revived the e-petitions website launched under the previous government.

Other initiatives have included Number 10's Red Tape Challenge, which asked people to nominate regulations for disposal, and a 'crowdsourcing' exercise asking public sector workers to submit suggestions on how to reduce wasteful spending as part of the Comprehensive Spending Review.

The Government is also working on placing all its services and data on to a single site dubbed www.gov.uk.

Success story: Since its launch in 2001, Wikipedia has become the sixth-most visited website, with more than 400milllion people viewing it every month

Mr Wales's appointment was announced by Rohan Silva, a senior Downing Street aide to Prime Minister David Cameron, last night at the South by Southwest technology conference in Austin, Texas.

In a talk, Mr Silva, reportedly told the audience that the government wanted to 'usher in the age of open source government'.

'(We) must use new technology to recast politics for the 21st century,' he said in a lecture entitled the Open Source Government, Enterprise and Innovation.

The appointment comes just days after it was revealed that MPs and their staff are tweaking their Wikipedia pages in bid to hide embarrassing information.

The Bureau of Investigative Journalism discovered almost 10,000 individual examples of people inside the Houses of Parliament directly editing Wikipedia articles.

The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, which carried out the investigation on behalf of the Independent, found that nearly one in six MPs have had their online Wikipedia entries changed from within Parliament.

Dozens of the alterations appeared to be attempts to erase embarrassing or disputed allegations made during the 2009 expenses scandal.
