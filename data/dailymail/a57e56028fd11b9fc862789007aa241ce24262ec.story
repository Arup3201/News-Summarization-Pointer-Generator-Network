Sergio Perez has issued an apology following his ill-advised comments about Susie Wolff.Â 

The Mexican was asked whether he'd enjoy driving alongside a female team-mate ahead of this weekend''s British Grand Prix, to which he replied: 'No, they are better off in the kitchen.'

But Perez moved to rectify his comments with a statement on his website on Saturday. 'I feel really ashamed by the way my words have been distorted about the opportunity of racing side by side with a woman,' Perez, who qualified seventh, said.

Back to business: Sergio Perez will start the British Grand Prix in seventh place on Sunday

'I want to be absolutely clear that my intention was not to offend anybody, and my comment does not reflect a 'macho' posture on my behalf.

'I recognise that my comment, even though it was intended as a joke, was absolutely out of place and also unacceptable.

'With Susie Wolff I have a very close friendship and I admire her greatly for her determination; I wish her the best of luck as a person and as a professional driver.'

Wolff, who became the first female racer in 22 years at a grand prix weekend after she took to the cockpit of her Williams in Friday's practice session, didn't appear offended by Perez's remarks.

'Saw some comments made by Sergio Perez as I was making dinner in the kitchen last night,' Wolff said.

'Please give him a break. His comments were taken completely out of context. Anyway, as my family will tell you, I drive better than I cook.'

All eyes were on Wolff on Friday, but her full Formula One debut lasted just four laps and 21 minutes after she was forced to stop on track with an oil-pressure problem.

The 31-year-old Briton will be given a chance to rectify her disappointing showing in practice for the German Grand Prix later this month.
