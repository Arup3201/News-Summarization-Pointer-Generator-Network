If you feel like you spend more time at the airport each year, that is because you do.

British air passengers suffered increased delays on flights last summer and families heading to Orlando in Florida endured the longest hold-ups.

The number of charter flights into and out of major UK airports that were on time dipped from 79 per cent in summer 2013 to 71 per cent in summer 2014, according to new statistics from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).

Families suffered more delays and longer waits last summer than the precious year

Flight punctuality also fell for scheduled flights, dropping from 80 per cent on time in summer 2013 to just 75 per cent last year.

The figures covered departures from 10 UK airports - Heathrow, Gatwick, Luton, Stansted, London City, Manchester, Birmingham, Newcastle, Edinburgh and Glasgow - during the summer period from July to September.

As well as the frequency, the length of the delays are also getting longer.

Both charter and scheduled flights suffered delays according to the Civil Aviation Authority statistics

The average delay to charter flights was 18 minutes in 2014 compared with 16 minutes in summer 2014. 

Average delays to scheduled flights rose from 12 minutes in summer 2013 to 14 minutes last summer.

There was a 2.3 per cent increase in the number of scheduled flights monitored in summer 2014 compared with the previous summer, while the number of scheduled flights monitored rose 0.6 per cent in summer 2014.

Flights to Orlando suffered the most delays, with an average wait of 31.9 minutes

Of the busiest 75 scheduled international destinations, Rotterdam in Holland recorded the highest on-time performance, with 87.6 per cent, and the lowest average delay, of 7.5 minutes.

Flights to and from Pisa in Italy achieved the lowest on-time performance, with 49.9 per cent.
