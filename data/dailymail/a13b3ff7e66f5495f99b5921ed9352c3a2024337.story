Magnus Carlsen has become the highest-rated chess player in history

He's been making all the right moves in the world of chess since the age of five and now Norwegian sensation Magnus Carlsen has become the game's highest-rated player ever.

The 22-year-old world number one has finally surpassed legendary Russian grandmaster Gary Kasparov's 12-year-old tally to be earn the prestigious accolade.

Known as the 'Mozart of chess' for the raw ability he demonstrated from a young age, Carlsen achieved his goal by defeating English player Luke McShane at the London Chess Classic this week.

Kasparov had previously claimed that his record rating of 2,851 was impossible to beat, but with victory over McShane, Carlsen nudged his own total to 2,857.4 points.

In typically understated fashion Carlsen, who has been world number one since he took the crown at the age of 19, said his win over McShane was a 'great start to the tournament' and he was satisfied with the record.

Ratings are determined through performance and they predict how likely a player is to beat a rival. Points are allocated accordingly.

Carlsen's manager Espen Agdestein said he didn't anticipate his client would be devoting any time to enjoying a few glasses of champagne to celebrate the landmark because he was 'a bit boring in that regard'.

The part-time model reportedly picks up a cool £933,000 a year from chess having developed a passion for the game when his father taught him how to play at the age of five.

Carlsen says his first goal in the game 
was to beat his sister, then his father. He progressed quickly and 
became an International grandmaster at the age of 13, the youngest at 
the time.

In October 2009, during the Nanjing Pearl Spring tournament, he became the fifth chess player in the history to achieve an Elo-rating over 2800 – by far the youngest to do so. That year he also became The World Blitz Chess champion.

In 2009 he took on 'The World' in a game of chess. Hikaru Nakamura (U.S.), Maxime Vachier-Lagrave (France) and Judit Polgar (Hungary) made suggestions to a live vote on the internet

On paper, The World had a reasonable chance, but with three players advising it's difficult to form a coherent plan.

In a King's Indian defence Carlsen could have won in a mundane way, but instead he finished in striking fashion, his passed pawns on the queenside proving unstoppable.

Carlsen started his recent game over McShane with the in-vogue Berlin defence and McShane went for a symmetrical set up that gave him a slight advantage when the middle game arrived.

Not one to shy away from complexities, Carlsen created chances for himself in the queen and minor piece endgame after coming back from the jaws of defeat. He avenged a loss at the hands of McShane in 2010 at the same venue.
