Charging an electric car could be as simple as finding a place to park it, as early as next year.

A pilot scheme being rolled out in New York City will see a handful of wireless charging stations, that look like manhole covers, for electric vehicles.

The start-up, based in the city, aims to make charging electric vehicles faster and easier with its wireless technology and app for drivers.

HEVO's manhole points use 
electromagnetic resonance to transfer electricity to the car's charging 
coil.

This negates the need for wires.

HEVO's technology claims to charge vehicles at greater distances than other 
wireless charging stations.

They currently still  take between 
eight and 12 hours to fully charge a vehicle.

HEVO Power has collaborated with New York University to bring the project to an area near Washington Park Square early next year.

The company's website says: 'The durable, embedded hardware unit will be deployed as a sustainable infrastructure device in city streets, parking lots and garages, motor pools, highways and other highly trafficked areas.'

While electric vehicles charging points are gradually being rolled out in some U.S. Cities (as well as in the UK,) it can take hours to charge a vehicle, which is not always practical.

HEVO's manhole points use electromagnetic resonance to transfer electricity to the car's charging coil - negating the need for wires - at greater distances than other wireless charging stations, although while they are faster, they currently still take between eight and 12 hours to fully charge a vehicle.

While they might be suitable for long-stay car parks or driveways, the firm envisions that in the future the intelligent manhole covers could be placed in rows along a traffic lane to top up cars' power while they are in motion.  

HEVO's founder, Jeremy McCool, told Fast Company there could be 'a small strip at every yard or so that has another wireless charging plate, so as you go down the street you're collecting a charge'.

The start-up's website says: 'It is the aim of HEVO today is to accelerate the 
adoption of electric vehicles through the deployment of our wireless 
charging network. 

'By offering a wireless charging option for electric 
vehicles, HEVO will provide a safe, fast and cost affordable method of 
charging electric vehicles that eliminates the hazards and inconveniences associated 
with plug-in charging.â€‹'

A HEVO app lets users find vacant parking spots in which to charge their cars as well as tell them the perfect position to park over the intelligent manholes (centre) so their car recharges in the most efficient way possible. It also tells them how much power their vehicle has

The company said its 'green parking' and 'green loading zones' will give commuters access to reliable, premium parking locations and cost-competitive power, while the range of commercial fleets will be extended and reduce traffic congestion.

There is also a HEVO app that lets users find vacant parking spots in which to charge their cars as well as tell them the perfect position to park over the intelligent manholes so their car recharges in the most efficient way possible.

A 'pay it!' feature allows users of the charging point to pay their electricity bill, while a power meter shows the vehicle's charging progress so users can check on their car's power remotely.

'HEVO Power Stations provides the peace-of-mind and reliability of opportunistic charging to electric vehicle owners who are discouraged by range anxiety, limited public charging locations and higher associated vehicle costs,' the company said.

The young company is talking to PepsiCo 
about the potential to create a system to charge its fleets of electric 
delivery lorries, placing charging points at loading zones to charge 
lorries when they are stocking up on supplies and making sure they do 
not have to deviate from their delivery routes, Popsci reported.
