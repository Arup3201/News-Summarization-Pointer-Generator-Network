Watchdog? Edward Snowden gave his first interview since outing himself famously as the NSA leaker. In it, he called out the American media for being complacent toward government power grabs

In his first interview since he outed himself as the source of leaked NSA documents, Edward Snowden said the media has given the government a free pass to grow unchecked power ever since the attacks of September 11.

‘[It] ended up costing the public dearly,’ the 30-year-old newly minted Russia resident told the New York Times in a Q&A published Tuesday.

Snowden’s interview  focused on journalists and the media, which he said need to wake up to the realities of surveillance. ‘Any unencrypted message sent over the Internet is being delivered to every intelligence service in the world,’ he said.

Snowden’s Q&A was, of course, 
done through encrypted emails. Laura Poitras, the documentary filmmaker 
who helped Snowden spill his secrets, served as intermediary, having won
 the former NSA contractor’s trust months ago.

‘Laura was more suspicious of me than I was of her, and I’m famously paranoid,’ Snowden told Times reporter Peter Maass.

Poitras may have reason to be suspicious.

Snowden,
 in describing his methods for choosing a reporter to work with while 
searching for a way to tell the world what he knew, said that basically 
all emails are possible targets for government surveillance.

Middle man: Laura Poitras helped Snowden leak what he knew. She also acted as intermediary between the New York Times and Snowden, who claimed nearly all emails from the media wind up in the hands of government agencies

Those from news organizations, he suggested, are all the more likely to be read.

'Assume
 that your adversary is capable of a trillion guesses per second,' he 
wrote to Poitras at the start of their work together, a relationship the New York Times documents alongside the Snowden interview.

‘In
 the wake of this year’s disclosures,’ he said, invoking the information
 about the NSA he himself leaked, ‘it should be clear that unencrypted 
journalist-source communication is unforgivably reckless.’

But
 Snowden, who had his American passport revoked in June and was recently
 granted asylum by the Russian government after weeks in territorial 
limbo, simultaneously faulted media outlets for being too permissive 
about government misdeeds in the post-9/11.

'Assume that your adversary is capable of a trillion guesses per second': While saying media has dropped the ball, Snowden warns that they, too, are being watched

‘The
 most important news outlets in America abdicated their role as a check 
to power,’ Snowden told the paper of record, ‘for fear of being seen as 
unpatriotic and punished in the market during a period of heightened 
nationalism. From a business perspective, this was the obvious strategy,
 but what benefited the institutions ended up costing the public 
dearly.’

But for all their complacency, Snowden says, big media organizations are slowly returning to the way they once were.

‘The major outlets are still only beginning to recover from this cold period,’ he said.

Snowden’s own actions, meanwhile, have surely hastened the process.

He said mainstream media is only just beginning to question government surveillance tactics, a change his actions have likely helped speed up
