He is too young to order his own drink, let alone to ask for an alcoholic one.

But at a gathering to mark his second birthday, restaurant staff helped Sonny Rees celebrate by serving him a large measure of whisky.

Despite grimacing every time he took a sip, he managed to drink enough of the 40% ABV spirit to become intoxicated, say his parents.

They only realised that he was 
probably not drinking fruit juice when they noticed his expression as he
drank the whisky and water through a straw.

Immediately after tasting the drink 
herself, worried mother Nina sought medical advice and took her son to 
the casualty department of the nearest hospital. He was monitored and 
later discharged.

Yesterday Mrs Rees, 34, said the 
incident at their local branch of restaurant chain Frankie and Benny’s 
had wrecked her son’s birthday celebrations.

All had started well enough. Sonny was
given a toy car by staff, and the family were eating their meals when 
they noticed the boy was pulling a strange face every time he swallowed 
what was supposed to be lime juice with water.

Mrs Rees, a teacher, said: ‘When I 
took a sip it was the unmistakable taste of whisky. No wonder he was 
pulling a face. I was panicking because he’d drunk quite a lot and I’d 
been encouraging him. Sonny had taken about ten sips – he was obviously 
intoxicated.

‘I asked to see the manager and said, 
“Have you given my child whisky?” She said, “Of course not”, but then 
she tried it and she knew there had been a horrible mistake.’  She said 
the manager apologised  and offered to get some water. However, Mrs Rees
telephoned NHS Direct which told her to get her son medical attention.

She said: ‘They checked him over in 
the hospital and they could see he was a bit drunk. But he’s two so he 
jabbers all the time anyway.

‘The doctor reassured me that alcohol 
passes quickly through the system and he would be fine. It’s a good job 
it wasn’t something sweet like peach schnapps because he might have 
liked that and guzzled the lot.’

Mrs Rees and her husband  Howell, an 
IT manager with South Wales Police, then took their only child home to 
Pontarddulais, near Swansea, where he vomited but has since recovered.

The family was given a 50 per cent 
discount on their meal bill. Mrs Rees said: ‘I’m very disappointed with 
Frankie and Benny’s – they ruined our day. We spent most of Sonny’s 
birthday in hospital with him.’

It is believed Frankie and Benny’s was
also hosting a stag do and staff mixed up Sonny’s drink with a whisky 
and water ordered by one of that group. A spokesman said: ‘The company 
is incredibly sorry. It was a human error and we are putting measures in
place to ensure it never happens again.’
