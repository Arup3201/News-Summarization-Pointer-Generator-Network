UEFA president Michel Platini has strongly supported FA chairman Greg Dyke’s campaign for more home grown players in the Premier League.

Dyke revealed on Monday that he wanted to increase the minimum number of homegrown players in club squads from eight to 12 in order to help the England team.

Platini, speaking after being elected unopposed for a third term at the UEFA Congress in Vienna, is the best possible ally for Dyke, who is sure to face formidable opposition from the all-powerful Premier League.

Greg Dyke wants more homegrown players in Premier League teams, raising the number per squad from eight to 12.

But only three current squads fall short of that number, though many of their homegrown players have yet to play for the first team.

Chelsea (11):

Cesc Fabregas, Gary Cahill, John Terry, Nathan Ake, Andreas Christensen, Jeremie Boga, Mitchell Beeney, Dominic Solanke, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Isaiah Brown, Jamal Blackman.

Tottenham (9):

Kyle Walker, Danny Rose, Andros Townsend, Ryan Mason, Harry Kane, Nabil Bentaleb, Ben Davies, Harry Winks, Joshua Onomah.

Manchester City (8):

Joe Hart, James Milner, Frank Lampard, Gael Clichy, Richard Wright, Dedryck Boyata, Bersant Celina, Jose Pozo.

Platini said: ‘This is a position we defend. We’re not only talking about England, we’re talking all of Europe. Mr Dyke’s struggle with the FA is something we share and we agree with him. With the new leader of the European Commission (Jean-Claude Juncker), it is important we establish close relations to see how we can protect homegrown, grassroots young players.

‘We share the same perspective. We will work hand in hand to defend an idea that we think is the right one. There is free flow of workers in Europe but there are some things that doesn’t apply to, like in this case.’

UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino was also enthusiastic about Dyke’s mission.

He said: ‘It’s fantastic. Eight out of 25 (the number of home-grown players that currently must be included in a Champions League squad) is not as many as it should be. So whatever move in favour of increasing homegrown players is something we can only support. Congratulations to England.’

Dyke’s proposals have irritated the Premier League who never like being dictated to by the FA. Dyke said on Tuesday: ‘We’re open to discussions and I’d like to persuade some of the clubs this is an issue.’

Dyke's plans also include 'home-grown' players having to train in England for three years before the age of 18

Manchester United director David Gill said the proposals needed 'to be discussed by all the stakeholders'

It could make for some tension between Dyke and the Premier League at the club summit tomorrow, especially as the Professional Game representatives on the FA Board had advised Dyke (left) last week not to go public.

Manchester United director David Gill sits on the UEFA ExCo and will join the FIFA ExCo in May after his election on Tuesday as the British vice-president. Gill, who is also a PL representative on the FA board, said: ‘It’s a relevant thing to look at, but it needs to be discussed by all the stakeholders.’

Michael Carrick said he would love more homegrown players to get opportunities but admitted it is difficult

Carrick said that the system doesn't always work in favour of players like it has for Harry Kane of late

United and England midfielder Michael Carrick said: ‘We’d all love more homegrown, British players to get opportunities. It’s difficult. There are two sides to the argument: you’ve got to be good enough to get the chance in the first place but someone’s got to give you that chance.

‘Someone like Harry Kane is the perfect example of how we’d all like it to be. He gets his chance and takes it and has elevated himself to another level.

‘But it doesn’t always work like that. Plenty of times you look at young lads and think, he’s got a chance but it doesn’t quite work.’

England team-mate Gary Cahill said: ‘I agree with some aspects. I think it’s important to have a mixture. I love to see young players getting opportunities. But I’m respectful of the fact that the Premier League is one of the best leagues in the world and it attracts some of the top players.

‘Fans want to see exciting players and top clubs want top players and sometimes they are overseas. It is a matter of getting that balance.’

Ritchie Humphreys, the PFA chairman and an FA Commission member, said: ‘Any foreign player who comes to this country we welcome. But we also have a duty of care to our national game and to young homegrown players.

‘Everything we are working towards on the FA Commission is with the aim of making our national side more competitive at elite level. The PFA supports that.’
