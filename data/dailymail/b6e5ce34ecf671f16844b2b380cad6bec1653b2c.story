Camille Grammer’s ‘abusive’ ex-boyfriend Dimitri has made a
string of lewd claims against the reality star - insisting that she
‘enjoyed’ having a hot dog stuffed in her mouth.

Dimitri Charalambopoulos is suing Camille for defamation following claims that he assaulted her last year.

This has led to the pair becoming embroiled in a massive
legal battle – with both parties insisting they have been damaged by the other.

The couple have detailed their fiery, two-year romance
in suits and counter-suits – and Camille has now filed a 'Slapp' motion to get
Dimitri's case thrown out of court and put an end to the bitter legal wrangling
once and for all.

The extent of their fractious relationship is alleged in
Camille's counter-suit, which states: 'During their relationship,
Counter-Defendant was verbally abusive, rude and argumentative on numerous
occasions, often in the presence of others...his behavior was typically worse
when he was consuming alcohol.

'For example, during a trip to Hawaii, Counter-Defendant and
Grammer went to a bar where Counter- Defendant proceeded to take multiple
shots. When Grammer asked Counter-Defendant to stop taking shots,
Counter-Defendant berated Grammer, shoved a hot dog into her mouth and said
something to the effect that she enjoyed having a hot dog in her mouth.'

In his defamation suit, Dimitri, who hails from
Texas, denies 'shoving' the hot dog and berating Camille, but, 'admits that
during adult conversation with friends he said Defendant enjoyed having a hot
dog in her mouth.'

He is also accusing the former Real Housewives Of Beverly
Hills star of lying about an alleged hotel-room blowout they are supposed to
have had late last year.

Camille alleges that Dimitri assaulted her during their stay
at The ZaZa hotel in Houston, Texas in October just days after she had surgery
for endometrial cancer and provided a court with photos of her bruised face
following the alleged altercation.

In January, she was granted a three-year restraining order.

However, Dimitri alleges that he immediately left the
couple's hotel room after Camille accused him of cheating on her.

And he claims that Camille concocted an entire fight;
smudging her make-up and pulling hair from her hairbrush and placing it around
the room. He also stated the bruises seen on her wrists were caused by her anastasologist.

Phones were also found disconnected and ripped from the wall.

Dimitri further claims that the alleged incident took place
after he had nursed her back to health following her cancer surgery, during
which he even helped her with showering and 'draining her catheter bag'.

The charges were put in front of a Grand Jury in Texas in May, however, the jury did not find sufficient evidence to indict Dimitri..

Dimitri insists his life has been ruined by Camille's
claims.

Dimitri is now suing his ex for defamation, malicious
prosecution, fraud and more, with the lawsuit, filed by his attorney Guy
Fisher, stating that no fight occurred.

Meanwhile, Camille's counter-suit also claims that shortly
after her surgery, Dimitri presented her with a 'post-surgery present', adding:
'He made a big point of opening his hands and slipping a ring onto her finger.

'For a day or two, he seemed amused that Grammer was wearing
his ring. As Grammer became more lucid, she looked down and realized, to great
embarrassment, that Counter-Defendant's ring had a plastic penis on it and that
she had been wearing it in front of her family and the hospital staff.'

For his version of events, Dimitri says he gave Camille the
ring to cheer her up following her surgery 'because it was consistent with an
inside joke they had during their relationship.

'However, no other person was in the room when the ring was
given to Defendant and Defendant took it off her finger very soon after the
joke was made. No family member or doctor was in the room when Defendant wore
the ring on her finger unless Defendant intentionally put the ring back on her
finger when Dimitri was not in the room.'

Camille is now recovering from her cancer treatment and in
June posted a hospital photo taken during her recovery from radical
hysterectomy surgery last October.

'Me the night after my to 5hr radical hysterectomy. My dad
took the pic & said I looked like a nun. #awereness #Cancer,' she captioned
the photo, in which she is bundled up in bed sheets with a hair net over her
blonde locks and an oxygen tube in her nose.

On August 8, Camille's legal team, led by top Los Angeles attorney Larry
Stein, filed a Slapp motion to dismiss Dimitri's defamation case.

However, a source told MailOnline today: 'We hope that the
court agrees there is no merit to Dimitri's claims.'

A judge has already granted a restraining order which found
that Dimitri committed this assault - despite the fact Dimitri filed against it, the judge found in Camille's favor.

The source added: ''She is more than happy to turn her medical records in and
the pictures - that proves the assault, But she just doesn't want to have every
medical record regarding her cancer become a matter of public record.

'It is difficult enough that she found herself in this
situation.'

It has been reported that Camille has hired bodyguards and increased
security in the wake of the alleged incident.

And the source told MailOnline: 'Camille wants nothing to do
with Dimitri, if he hadn't brought a suit against her, she would never have
bothered with a civil suit against him.

'She is doing this because he sued her and she's not just
going to sit back.'

Asked how Camille, a mother-of-three and the ex-wife of
Cheers star Kelsey Grammer, was faring, the source said: 'She's doing quite
well, she went through quite an ordeal, this has been a very difficult
time for her.'

A spokesman for Camille declined to comment, while a representative for Dimitri was unavailable.
