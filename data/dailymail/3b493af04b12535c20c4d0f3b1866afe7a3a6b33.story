West Ham have made a formal approach for Sunderland's Connor Wickham.

As revealed by Sportmail last week, the striker has yet to be offered a new contract by the Black Cats, despite manager Gus Poyet issuing a 'sign or leave' ultimatum to the player.

West Ham and Newcastle were alerted to his situation and the Londoners are now in discussions over a fee. Sunderland want to recoup the £8million they paid Ipswich Town three years ago but the Hammers' valuation is nearer £5m.

Wickham has never agitated for a move away from the Stadium of Light but has been forced to assess his options with Sunderland having not given him a new deal to consider.

The 21-year-old's current contract expires next summer and it now appears likely he will leave the club.

Wickham scored the goals which kept Sunderland in the Premier League last season and, with the squad light on attacking options, his departure would be a blow on the eve of the season.

North-East rivals Newcastle are also keen on Wickham but Sunderland would be reluctant to let him join the Magpies in light of Jack Colback's move to Tyneside earlier this summer.
