Edinson Cavani was one of three players sent off as injury-hit Paris St Germain beat struggling RC Lens 3-1 in a heated Ligue 1 game at the Stade de France on Friday.

The Uruguay international was booked after celebrating with a gun toting gesture and was then shown a red card after arguing with the referee. At one point, the striker appears to touch the official.  

PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has criticised the controversial decision, insisting that punishments given for such celebrations are bad for French football.

'It is the media's job to speak about the referee,' he said to Canal +.

'Cavani does not deserve that red card. And why has he got a yellow before? He always does the same celebration.

'This is not normal and it is not good for French football if we want to develop. It is a bad situation for everyone.'

Nonetheless, the Parisiens moved up to second in the standings with 18 points from 10 games, four adrift of Olympique de Marseille who have a game in hand. 

Lens, who were hosting the match at the Stade de France as their Bollaert stadium is closed for renovation ahead of Euro 2016, went ahead on 10 minutes when Adama Coulibaly fired home from the edge of the box.

PSG, without injured striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic and centre backs Thiago Silva, David Luiz and Marquinhos, hit back in the 28th minute when Yohan Cabaye found the back of the net with a 20-metre strike from Maxwell's pass.

The Brazilian full back doubled the tally six minutes later with a clever 25-metre lob.

Things got worse for promoted Lens in the 54th minute when Jean-Philippe Gbamin was sent off for a second bookable offence after he pushed Edinson Cavani in the box.

The Uruguay striker converted the resulting penalty to put PSG 3-1 up, just before himself being sent off for touching the referee's arm.

Lens finished the game with nine men when Jerome Le Moigne was dismissed after picking up a second yellow card on 59 minutes.

The result left Lens in 18th place with eight points from 10 matches.

'There were some incidents which meant that, unfortunately, the match lost a lot of interest in the second half,' PSG coach Laurent Blanc said. 'At 10 against nine, the teams canceled each other out and it wasn't a great match.' 

There is also now another name on PSG's injury list, with midfielder Blaise Matuidi limping off with a thigh injury in the 20th minute.

'It's been a difficult start to the season for us in terms of injuries,' Blanc said. 'Our medical staff has a lot to do at the moment.'
