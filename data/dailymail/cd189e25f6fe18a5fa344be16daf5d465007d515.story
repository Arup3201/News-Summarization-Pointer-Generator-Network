The body of a Perth man is believed to have been located in Nepalese mountains after he was reported missing six months ago.

Matt Allpress, 23, had been on a solo 10-day hiking trek in Nepal’s Annapurna region and missed his flight home on November 14 last year.

Human remains were located on Saturday by two local Nepalese people foraging in the mountains above Sikles, about one hour off the main track.

Police located several personal items belonging to Mr Allpress including his ATM card, 120 Nepalese rupees, a jacket, pocket diary and iPhone. 

''The investigation has been intensified further after the family members and friends identified his personal items which were found there on Saturday,' acting chief district officer Arjun Sharma told the The Himalayan Times. 

Mr Allpress' mother Margaret is currently in Nepal but said she was waiting for authorities to return from the search area in Sikles to find out more.

His father is on his way to Nepal from Western Australia.

The Allpress family last heard from their son on November 3 when he sent a message from a guesthouse in Sikles saying he would be 'out of contact for 9-11 days, heading to a place called Dudh Pokhari, then I'm back in time for my flight into Sydney on November 14.'

Mr Allpress was listed as a missing person on November 17 after his family raised the alarm when he didn't arrive in Sydney and failed to alert anyone that he had missed his flight.

His family flew to Nepal to help the search efforts by following his planned route, organising three helicopter searches and contracting a private search and rescue dogs group.

Mr Allpress had moved to Europe for 18 months after graduating from Curtin University in Western Australia with a creative design degree. 

He was on his way back to Australia when he made the scheduled stop in Nepal to undertake the trek through the Annapurna region. 

Mr Allpress' friends and family had remained optimistic of finding him alive by creating a social media campaign using the hashtag #FindMatt to help locate him and update followers on the search efforts.

The team raised almost $10,000 in December to help fund the expensive helicopter and dog searches.

A Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade spokeswoman said Australian officials in Canberra and Kathmandu were continuing to provide consular assistance to the Allpress family.
