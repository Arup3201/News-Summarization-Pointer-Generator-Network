A man blackmailed a terrified Muslim teenager into handing over more than £15,000 worth of her mother’s jewellery to stop him exposing a sex tape of her on Facebook.

Aamir Khan, 20, told the 16-year-old girl that he had covertly filmed her during an intimate encounter with him in his car.

He then made demands for money and gold, threatening to post the footage on Facebook and send a copy to her parents.

'Cynical betrayal': Aamir Khan blackmailed a Muslim teenager, 16, into handing over more than £15,000 worth of family jewellery to stop him exposing her in a sex tape on Facebook, Leicester Crown Court (pictured) heard

The victim was so frightened of her parents finding out that she took jewellery, including irreplaceable family heirlooms, and handed them to Khan through her bedroom window on several occasions.

The Muslim girl was so ashamed that she considered running away from home and killing herself, Leicester Crown Court heard.

Khan, of Spinney Hills, Leicester, admitted blackmail and was sentenced to three years and seven months youth detention.

Judge Michael Pert QC described Khan’s actions as ‘wicked’ and a ‘cynical betrayal’.

He said: ‘The blackmail happened in 2009 when you were 18 and she was 16. It's of some significance you both come from a background where the shame of teenage sex would have more impact than perhaps it might in other circles.

‘You made a number of demands over several weeks, cynically and brutally. 

‘She would have been mortified of photographs going on Facebook and her parents getting to know. There has to be a deterrent sentence.

‘People must realise what an appalling crime this is and how members of society view it with disgust.’

He said Khan only admitted his wrongdoing after a long delay, on the day of the trial.

Judge
 Pert said: ‘You hoped to get away with it and didn't plead guilty until
 the last minute, causing the victim more anguish about whether she'd 
have to say what had happened in court - and then be called a liar.’

A pre-sentence report on Khan described him as ‘controlling and manipulative’.

Jonathan Eley, prosecuting, said after the sexual encounter with the victim the defendant dropped her off in his car.

Khan casually remarked: ‘It's a good thing Blackberrys [phones] have cameras.’

A few minutes later he phoned the girl, saying he had filmed what had happened, the court heard.

Mr
 Eley said: ‘He told her to get money or he'd post a copy of the film 
through her letterbox and put it on Facebook so her family would see 
what kind of daughter they had.’

‘The family had high value, high carat jewellery and she took rings, bangles and chains.

'Wicked' threats: Khan made demands for money and gold, threatening to post the tape on Facebook and mail a copy to her parents  after telling the victim he had covertly filmed an intimate encounter with her

‘The
 next night the defendant collected it from her window. He later falsely
 claimed half of it was fake and demanded more gold and made more 
threats about the video.

‘A day or so later he took more bangles, chains and necklaces with family names on them.’

He told her he needed the money to recompense someone for damage he caused to a car, and later demanded more gold because he needed to spend money on his own vehicle.

Mr Eley said: ‘She told him it was all gone. He then sent her a message saying he'd given the video to a colleague who knew where she lived and demanded £500.’

There was a burglary a few weeks later at the house, by persons unknown.

The victim's sister suspected something was wrong and found incriminating phone messages from Khan to her sister, demanding gold.

The girl confessed to her family, who have had rallied round to support her, said Mr Eley.

No video footage was ever recovered and it is believed no sexual encounter was ever recorded. None of the jewellery, worth £15,000, has been found.

In a victim personal statement, the girl said she thought about running away and ending her life because of the ‘whole nightmare for me and my family’.

Judge Pert made a restraining order banning Khan from any contact with the victim or her family.

Anthony Rimmer, mitigating, said: ‘It was an unsophisticated blackmail. He's shown genuine remorse and realises the shame and abhorrence it's caused to the girl's family.

‘He wishes he could turn the clock back.’
