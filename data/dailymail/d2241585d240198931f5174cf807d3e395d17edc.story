An Oklahoma man faces multiple rape charges over a game of truth or dare he allegedly played with two underage girls that turned sexual on more than one occasion. 

Authorities in Moore say 20-year-old Danny Hilton would 'dare' the two girls - ages 14 and 15 - to perform sex acts on both him and on each other.

One of the girls eventually told her mother.

Court documents obtained by news9.com show that one of the incidents occurred in February in Hilton's bedroom at his parents' home. The girls later told authorities that Hilton encouraged them to accept various 'dares' that were sexual in nature.

Dare: Authorities say Danny Hilton would 'dare' the two girls to perform sex acts on him and on each other

When police interviewed the two girls, they were told about at least three other incidents involving the 15-year-old dating back to August of 2013.

The 15-year-old told police that she successfully fought off one of Hilton's alleged sexual attacks.

Hilton's father claims the incidents happened in his son's bedroom when he was either sleeping or not at home. 

When Hilton's father confronted him about the allegations, he denied them. The elder Hilton then kicked his son out of his house.

Truth: Hilton admitted to authorities that he played the game with the two girls, and to having sexual contact with them

In a subsequent interview with police, Hilton admitted to playing the game with the two girls, and to the sex acts, according to court documents.

Despite admitting to the alleged crime, people have taken to social media to support - or defend - the alleged sexual predator.

In one Facebook post, Ramona Ager - an Oklahoma woman who identifies herself on social media as being an employee of a company called Raising the Standard Ministries - questions whether the two girls are actually victims.

'I'm not saying that he shouldn't be held accountable but this BOY is just barely out of HIS teens himself! and I don't think these girls are as "innocent" as they are portraying to be,' she posted on a local news website 'I think they are making him the scapegoat and "playing the victim".... if I truly felt like I was violated, I certainly would NOT go back even ONE time much less "several times".... now this young man is labeled FOR LIFE as a sex offender...... smh.'

Hilton currently is in the Cleveland County Jail on three counts of second-degree rape and two counts of forcible sodomy.
