A man who has served ten years of a life prison sentence for murder, has been released after his wife tracked down the true killer.

Nguyen Thanh Chan, 52, was given the maximum term for the murder and robbery of a woman in August 2003 despite a lack of hard evidence linking him to the attack.

After a failed appeal the Supreme People's Court of Vietnam, the innocent man feared he would spend the rest of his life behind bars.

Reunited: Chan was able to return home to his wife, who secured his release with a ten-year long campaign

But in July this year, Thanh Chan's wife Thi Chien, who has campaigned tirelessly since her husband's imprisonment, gave police the name of the man she believed to be behind the attack.

In a petition, she said Ly Nguyen Chung, a 25-year-old from the same village as the couple, was the murderer.

Acting on information, police interviewed Chung's step-mother and brother, both of whom said they believed their relative was the killer.

Chung, who was 14 at the time of the attack, went on the run in Thailand and China but has handed himself in to a police station in Dak Lak province and pleaded guilty to the murder.

President Sang of Vietnam ordered the case be retried and has requested an investigation.

Speaking after his release Chan said: 'I feel as if I am born again

'During the past 10 years in prison, I always hoped that I would be vindicated one day'

The trial of Ly Nguyen Chung, begins tomorrow. Because of his age at the time of the murder, will be tried as a child.
