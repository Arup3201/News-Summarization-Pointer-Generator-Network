These are the eery family portraits of unknowns found strewn amongst the carnage of Japan's Tsunami.

Emergency services salvaged over 750,000 images in Yamamoto and returned most of them to their owners as they helped clear up the aftermath of the deadly natural disaster.

But over 30,000 were damaged beyond recognition, with the incumbents' faces often spookily washed away by the millions of tonnes of water that spilled onto the land.

Of the 750,000 images found in Yamamoto, over 30,000 were damaged beyond recognition

Emergency services salvaged over 750,000 images in Yamamoto and returned most of them to their owners, this is one of the unlucky ones

Dozens of snaps show people in happier times - smiling, playing, laughing - but crucially their identities have been lost to the devastating effects of the water.

Holiday snaps, weddings, baby births and children's birthdays - all documented in the striking series of images found discarded about the coastal town at the heart of the disaster zone.

In one poignant image a suburban 
street, completely obliterated by the surging tides, can be seen before 
the diaster - but with the middle water damaged leaving a simply white 
space.

Volunteer group Salvage memory decided to take ownership of the images and turn them into a permanent memorial to the victims.

The missing images now form an exhibition currently showing in New York

Professional photographer, Munemasa Takahashi, has taken it upon himself to photograph the 30,000 untraceable snaps.

The exhibition hopes to reunite the photographs to their original owners

Sako Shimizu, who was luckily in Tokyo when the disaster occurred, said: 'They stir up and sear people's imagination because of the water damage.

'Although the faces are mostly unrecognisable, you can tell that they capture happy moments.

'The disaster affected everyone. Most of the victims are just statistics which lessen the feelings towards them.

'But these photos make viewers think of them and remember them on a more personal level, and hope they survived the disaster.

Volunteers numbering nearly 500 are 
still helping authorities sieve through the bundles of images rescued - 
and are using social media to help trace those seen in them.

Sako added: 'One of our volunteers is actually from Yamamoto where all the images were recovered from.

'He was thankfully out of town on a 
business trip and his house was too badly affected by the tsunami. But 
the earthquake that followed partially destroyed it.

'His wife and five-year-old daughter evacuated from their town up north to Hakkaido. He is still faced with living away from his family.

He, alongside the other volunteers, 
have created an exhibit to display the poignant photos and are using the
money raised to help support victims in Yamamoto.

The exhibit will be on display in New York between April 2 and April 27.

'It is also very strange for him as 
he knew lots of the people in the images, but didn't know if they were 
alive or safe and well.'

Another
Japanese nuclear reactor was taken off line for maintenance on Monday, 
leaving the country with only one of its 54 reactors operational 
following last year's devastating earthquake and tsunami.

The
last reactor is expected to be shut down by early May, raising the 
possibility of power shortages across the nation as demand increases in 
the hot summer months.The 
No. 6 reactor at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa complex was taken off line early
Monday by the Tokyo Electric Power Co.

The utility also runs the plant 
in Fukushima, northeast of Tokyo, that suffered meltdowns, explosions 
and radiation leaks after the March 11 quake and tsunami.Japanese
reactors are taken off line every 13 months for regular checks.

With 
concerns over nuclear safety high following the Fukushima crisis, none 
of the reactors that have been shut down for checks, and none that were 
already off line at the time of the disaster, have been allowed to 
restart. The last reactor, 
on the northern island of Hokkaido, will be shut down in May.

The timing
for when any reactors will be restarted remains unclear. Before
the crisis, Japan depended on nuclear power for one-third of its 
electricity. Japan's government wants to restart reactors as soon as 
'stress tests' prove they are safe, but faces strong public opposition.

Local leaders, fearing a political backlash, are reluctant to give their
approval.Authorities have
required all reactors to undergo the stress tests and make necessary 
modifications to improve safety. The stress tests, similar to those used
in France and elsewhere in Europe, are designed to assess how well the 
plants can withstand earthquakes, tsunamis, storms, loss of power and 
other crises.

Prime 
Minister Yoshihiko Noda has promised to reduce Japan's reliance on 
nuclear power over time and plans to lay out a new energy policy by the 
summer.

In the meantime, 
Japan has temporarily turned to oil and coal generation plants to make 
up for the shortfall, and businesses have been required to reduce 
electricity use to help with conservation efforts.
