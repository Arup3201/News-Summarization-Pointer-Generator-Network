Tottenham boss Maurico Pochettino says the club are expecting big things from Erik Lamela after his two goals helped secure a first win for the new manager.

The former Roma striker struck twice in the first half before Andros Townsend sealed a 3-2 pre-season friendly victory over MLS side Toronto.

The Spurs club-record £30million signing was hampered by a series of injuries last year but Pochettino hopes he now has the opportunity to excel.

The ex Southampton boss said: ‘We expect a lot from him, he’s an unbelievable player.

‘He needs to show us that he deserves to play, but at the moment we are happy with his performance.’

Lamela, who made just nine Barclays Premier League appearances in an injury-hit campaign last season, says he is now fit and raring to go.

He said: ‘I felt like I was able to play a good 45 minutes. Overall I think the team did really well and I’m happy with the performance today.

‘I had an unfortunate injury last season that kept me out of play for quite some time.

'In the same way, it’s helped me emotionally and morally to get better and work harder towards this season.’

New signing Ben Davies sported the No 33 shirt in his first appearance for the club, just hours after sealing his move from Swansea.

Pochettino said: 'The season is very long and we need to stay deep at every position.

‘Ben Davies is important for us because he’s good competition for Danny Rose on the left side. He’s a young player, but he has good experience in the Premier League.’
