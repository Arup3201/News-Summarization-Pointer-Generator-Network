'Throw open the doors': Mr Murdoch said Australia needed more immigrants to be competitive. His speech in Sydney broke his support for the government

Australia should throw open its doors to immigrants to make the country more competitive, media mogul Rupert Murdoch has said.

In contrast to his backing for the new government's tough policy on asylum seekers, Mr Murdoch said immigration would help the country become more competitive.

The diversity created by immigration, and the ties it brings with other nations, particularly in Asia, would help give Australia a leg-up as it seeks trade relationships, the head of News Corp explained.

'Australia is on its way to becoming 
what may be the world's most diverse nation,' Mr Murdoch said in a 
speech to the Lowy Institute think tank in Sydney. 'This is an 
incredible political advantage.'

Mr Murdoch compared Australia with 
the United States, which he said was being 'racked by self-defeating 
debate over immigration policy'.

The steady flow of refugee boats is a
hot political issue in Australia, polarising voters, while stoking 
tension with neighbours like Indonesia and Sri Lanka.

The new conservative, Liberal-led 
coalition government came to power partly on the back of a tough 
campaign against asylum seekers, following a relaxation of border 
policies by the former Labor government that resulted in a rise in the 
number of boats.

But its hardline border security policies have been criticised by the United Nations.

News Corp's media outlets in Australia were staunch supporters of Prime Minister Tony Abbott, with his best-selling Daily Telegraph tabloid urging readers to 'Kick This Mob Out' over a photo of former Labor leader Kevin Rudd.

Mr Murdoch's support for immigration did
come with a caveat. Newcomers, he said, should abide by Australia's 
values, institutions and way of life.

'There is still a strand among some parts of Australian society who seem to value every culture except our own,' he said.

Revelations about phone-hacking engulfed News Corp during the summer of 2011, forcing Murdoch to close the 168-year-old News of the World.

Rebekah Brooks, Murdoch's former British newspaper chief, and others went on trial in London this week accused of conspiring to illegally access voicemail messages on mobile phones.

News of the World ex-chief correspondent Neville Thurlbeck, former assistant news editor James Weatherup, and ex-news editor Greg Miskiw pleaded guilty to conspiracy to intercept communications at earlier hearings.
