The first camera that can see round corners has been shown off by MIT researchers.

People lurking behind a wall - or buried after an earthquake - can clearly be seen in 3D using the camera, which fires ultrafast laser pulses at walls 'behind' the area that can't be seen, to capture a ghostly 3D reflection.

The camera 'bounces' ultrafast laser pulses off a wall behind a hidden subject - and computers inside 'rebuild' the information into a 3D image of what's hidden

The technique is similar to using a mirror to see round a corner - but instead of a mirror, the 'reflection' is reconstructed from laser light that scatters back off a wall.

The camera 'times' the beams of light as
they bounce back to its sensors, and builds an image, which is slightly
wobbly, but precise to ranges of just one centimetre.

Ramesh Raskar and colleagues used ultrafast pulsed lasers in the research published in Nature Communications - the incredibly rapid laser bursts allow them to time the light as it 'returns' to the camera, building a 3D model.

The system performs the procedure several times, bouncing light off several different spots on the wall, so that it enters the room at several different angles.

The detector, too, measures the returning light at different angles. By comparing the times at which returning light strikes different parts of the detector, the system can piece together a picture of the room.

'Four years ago, when I talked to people in ultrafast optics about using femtosecond lasers for room-sized scenes, they said it was totally ridiculous,' says Ramesh Raskar, an associate professor at the MIT Media Lab, who led the new research.

The team use repeated laser bursts to build a 3D image of the 'hidden areas' of rooms

Raska hopes that a future version of the system could be used by emergency responders - firefighters looking for people in burning buildings or police determining whether rooms are safe to enter - or by vehicle navigation systems, which could bounce light off the ground to look around blind corners.
