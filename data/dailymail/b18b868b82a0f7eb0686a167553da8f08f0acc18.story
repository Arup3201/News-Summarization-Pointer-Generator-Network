Colombia striker Jackson Martinez has revealed he would find it difficult to turn down a move to Arsenal - the club he supported as a young boy.

The Gunners have been linked with a series of strikers this summer including Bayern Munich's Mario Mandzukic and AC Milan centre forward Mario Balotelli, but Martinez is believed to be Arsene Wenger's preferred choice.

The 27-year-old has helped take Columbia to the quarter-finals of the World Cup where they face hosts Brazil on Friday.

The clinical finisher has scored 60 goals in 91 games for his current club Porto and carries a £35million buyout clause in his contract - a fee that Wenger is reportedly willing to pay.

Martinez said: 'I know that there have been discussions, but still no agreements.

'My agent is taking care of my future, right now I'm at the World Cup and only after the World Cup I'll evaluate proposals.

'As a child I cheered for Arsenal, they play a game that suits me. If I had the occasion to play there, I would say yes.'

The Gunners are in need of reinforcements up front with Olivier Giroud toiling alone for most of last season while they have also released Nicklas Bendtner and seen a return for Real Sociedad's Carlos Vela collapse.
