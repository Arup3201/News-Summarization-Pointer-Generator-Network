A little girl got the surprise of her life when her blanket and stuffed animal lambie were returned to her in the mail after she thought she'd lost them forever.

Seven-year-old Reagan Porter, from Eden Prairie, Minnesota, was vacationing with her parents in Montgomery, Texas, when she accidentally left her precious cargo behind.

Fortunately, a caring employee at La Torretta Lake Resort, where the Porters had been staying, made it her mission to return the items to their rightful owner.

Reunited: Seven-year-old Reagan Porter, from Eden Prairie, Minnesota, got the surprise of her life when her blanket and stuffed animal lambie were returned to her after she believed she'd lost them forever

Lost and found: Reagan was vacationing with her parents in Montgomery, Texas, when she accidentally left her precious cargo behind. Thankfully, hotel employee Christina Cooper went the extra mile to find them

Christina Cooper, 25, the resort's loss-prevention lead supervisor, told ABC News that Mr Porter called her the day he and his family checked out in the hopes that she could return the toys to his daughter.

After an initial search, she failed to find them and assumed they'd gotten mixed up in laundry.

But about a month later, Mrs Cooper - who has a three-year-old son of her own - checked the housekeeping bin once more and discovered what she had been looking for.

Eager to put a smile on little Reagan's face, she found the Porters' information and called them immediately. The girl's father answered.

Personal touch: Not only did she send the things back to Reagan, but she attached a note to her from the lambie that read: 'I missed you and I love you and I'm so glad to see you'

'You could just hear it in his voice 
before I even said anything,' the hotel employee explained. 'I could tell he was 
hoping it would be about her lost stuffed animal.'

Not only did she want to return the beloved things to Reagan, but Mrs Cooper also decided to go the extra mile to make the little girl especially happy.

'I had asked the dad if I could address 
the box to his daughter, because you know how kids get when they receive 
things in the mail,' she explained.

'And I also asked if I could attach a
 note to the lamb doll that would seem like he was talking to her.'

On the note, the thoughtful mother-of-one wrote: 'I missed you and I love you and I'm so glad to see you.'

Her efforts undoubtedly paid off; in a heartwarming moment that was captured on video, Reagan is seen opening a package to find her lambie and blanket inside, and her jubilant squealing says it all.
