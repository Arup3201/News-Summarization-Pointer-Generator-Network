A father who was run over by his own car after it took off with him beneath it to the witness of his three young boys is hospitalized in critical condition this week.

Paul Pattison had climbed beneath his Jeep trying to jump start it on a Summerville, South Carolina road when it took off on Sunday afternoon while carrying his children, the oldest aged 11.

'He had to get up underneath it and start it with a screwdriver by touching the solenoid's together and just that split second he didn't put it back in park from drive,' James Libby, his friend of 25 years told WCSC.

Horrific accident: Paul Pattison, a father of three young boys, had climbed beneath his Jeep trying to jump start it when it took off running over his chest and head

It was a move Mr Libby said his friend had done dozens of times before, but this time, most likely rushed because of traffic, he forgot to put it in park.

Taking off, the vehicle rolled directly over the father and into a roadside ditch.

The wheels stopped spinning only after his oldest son, aged 11, hopped into the front seat and shifted it into park.

'Unfortunately, the vehicle ran over his chest and head area. He has some brain trauma,' said Mr Libby.

Tragic mistake: A family friend said that Mr Pattison forgot to put his vehicle in park after it stalled on this road and before he climbed beneath it to get it going again

The coincidence of an off-duty EMS worker driving behind Mr Pattison along with his airlift to a nearby hospital are what Mr Libby credits for saving his friend's life.

But visiting him in hospital after his surgery on Monday and seeing the extent of his injuries he said left him not only 'mortified,' but 'terrified for him and for his kids.'

'He was hooked up to a lot of machinery, he was obviously hurting,' said Mr Libby. 'I'd like to think that he knew I was there. They had him doped up pretty good on medication so he wasn't talking.'

Son's quick thinking: Pictured with two of his three young boys, it was his oldest son, aged 11, who jumped in the passenger seat and put the car in park as its wheels spun in a ditch

It was a state trooper and Mr Pattison's young children that told him everything that had happened.

'It's just terrible what's happened to him and his family over this. They really need the help and prayers of all the people around here to help Paul get through this,' he said.

Further helping the father and his family in their time of need, Mr Libby has set up a trust fund for Mr Pattisonâ€™s wife at their local Suntrust bank.

The boys' school is also holding a fundraiser.
