Germany’s express delivery company, Deutsche Post (DHL), is testing a drone that could be used to deliver urgently needed goods such as medicine to remote locations in the future.

The debut of the yellow remote-controlled helicopter follows the debut of Amazon's octocopter, which could be used to deliver packages to its customers in the future, replacing postmen and cutting the delivery times of its goods.

The German firm’s small quadcopter flew a package of medicine from a pharmacy in the city of Bonn to the company’s headquarters on the other side of the Rhine river.

DHL said its yellow drone would be used to delivery urgently needed goods such as medicine to remote locations. The aircraft can carry approximately six-and-a-half pounds and has four propellers

The aircraft can carry approximately six-and-a-half pounds (three kilograms) and has four propellers, while Amazon’s robot has eight.

DHL’s yellow drone is known as the ‘Paketkopter’ and flew at a height of 50 metres for one kilometre, taking just two minutes to complete its journey, The Local reported.

Two men controlled the vehicle using a remote control, but the company said technology is available to send the drones to a specified location using GPS alone.

DHL’s spokesman, Thomas Kutsch, said the 
flights all this week are strictly a research project to see if the 
technology works and there are no plans yet to start actual drone 
deliveries.

The test flights required permission from local aviation authorities.

Amazon plans to deliver goods to customers by drone within five years, despite legal obstacles in the U.S.

Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, said that he wants to use octocoptors to replace postmen and cut delivery times to just 30 minutes.

Customers would have their order dropped onto their front lawn by the machine which would fly through the air from a nearby warehouse with it clasped in a metal grabber.

Speaking to US TV network CBS, Bezos said: ‘I know this looks like science fiction. It’s not.’

Bezos’ claims raise the prospect of a future where drones travel across the sky all the time ferrying post around - and perhaps one day even letters, too.  

In the interview Bezos said that the drones would be able to carry goods up to 5lb in weight, which covers 86 per cent of the items that the company delivers.

Bezos said that he wants to launch the ‘Amazon Prime Air’ service within four to five years, though that will almost certainly be in the US before anywhere else.

This ruling paves the way for companies, including Amazon, to use drones to deliver goods commercially across the United States, pictured. However, companies may still come up against regulations that prohibit any aircraft to fly autonomously, without anyone at the controls
