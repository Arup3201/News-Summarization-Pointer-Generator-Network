Embattled Toronto Mayor Rob Ford has another scandal on his hands after Toronto police arrested his occasional driver and security guard.

Alexander Lisi, 35, was arrested on Tuesday evening during a raid on an Etobicoke dry-cleaning store.

Mayor Rob Ford says he’s 'very surprised' that the man who works for him occasionally is now facing multiple drug charges.

Liability? Barely a week goes by without the Mayor of Toronto Rob Ford being involved in some scandal or other

On bail: Alexander Lisi, friend and occasional driver of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, leaves Old City Hall court in Toronto after being granted bail on drug charges

In a statement, Toronto police said 
they made the arrests when executing a search warrant in connection with
an ongoing criminal investigation.

Lisi is described in reports as a member of Ford’s entourage, but does not serve an official role in the mayor's office.

He has been charged with trafficking and possession marijuana and conspiracy to commit an indictable offence.

Yesterday,
Mayor Ford held a brief news conference at a gas station near his home 
telling reporters that he considers Lisi 'a friend.'

Out on bail: Alexander Lisi, has been charged with trafficking and possession of marijuana, according to Toronto police

In the past, Ford has said that Lisi is 'straight as an arrow.'

'He’s
a friend, he’s a good guy and I don’t throw my friends under the bus,' 
Mr Ford said. 'I’ve never once seen the guy drink, never once seen him 
do drugs.'

Ford said he was 'very surprised' by the charges, but said he could not say much else because the matter 'is before the courts.'

Lisi was released on $5,000 bail along with Jamshid Bahrami, who is reportedly the owner of the dry cleaners.

Bahrami is charged with three offenses, including possession of cocaine.

Both men are scheduled to appear in court on November 12th.

Scandal: A still image allegedly taken from the video given to the Globe and Mail and Gawker.com purportedly shows Ford with two men, one of whom is believed to have been murdered over the video

Lisi’s
name first came to public attention in August, when it was reported 
that he and other associates of Rob Ford were under investigation for 
their alleged efforts to retrieve a well-known but little-seen cellphone
video that reportedly appears to show Ford smoking crack.

Ford
was consumed by a sea of media speculation in May of this year after 
rumors of the video surfaced, but he adamantly claimed that it didn't 
exist.

A still image - allegedly taken from the video - purportedly shows Ford with three men.

Pout: Vacated by his communications staffers and facing drug allegations, Ford has clearly seen better days

Some critics called on Ford to step down, but he has vowed to seek re-election next year.

The mayor has been embroiled in almost weekly controversies about his behavior since being elected in 2010.

The
Toronto Star reported earlier this year that the mayor was asked to 
leave a gala fundraiser for wounded Canadian soldiers because he 
appeared intoxicated.

During
his campaign for mayor, Rob Ford vehemently denied a 1999 arrest for 
marijuana possession in Florida, but later acknowledged it was true 
after he was presented with evidence.

He pleaded guilty to driving under the influence and failing to give a breath sample to police.

While
in office, he has been accused of flouting conflict of interest rules 
and making obscene gestures at residents from his car.
