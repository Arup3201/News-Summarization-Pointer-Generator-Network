The student who has stated he does not want to be identified because he fears for his safety, says there's 'no doubt' he saved a life by disarming the gunman. The next day the school suspended him for three days.

A pupil who was also riding the bus at the time but who did not want to be identified said: 'I think he was really going to shoot him right then and there.'

According to Fox4Now.com the student was suspended for his role in an 'incident' where a weapon was present and given an "emergency suspension.'

The student says the struggle began as he grappled with a football player who was threatening to shoot a teammate he had been arguing with.

He grabbed the .22 caliber RG-14 revolver away from the suspect.

'It's dumb,' he said. 'How they going to suspend me for doing the right thing?'

The teen's mother has been speaking to local media: 'If they wouldn't of did what they had to do on that bus,' she said, 'I think there would have been a lot of fatalities.'

Investigation: Other witnesses on the bus say there would have been fatalities had the teenager not intervened

Police reports state the suspected gunman was arrested and charged with possession of a firearm on school property and assault with a deadly weapon without intent to kill.

Sergeant David Valez of the Lee County Sheriff's Office said an investigation into the incident is ongoing.

Authorities have said there was no video available of the tussle because school bus surveillance cameras weren't working.

No comment: The school is refusing to discuss the incident but the suspected gunman has been arrested and charged with possession of a firearm on school property and assault with a deadly weapon

The school has also refused to comment on the incident 'We cannot discuss specifics involving students,' said district spokesman Alberto Rodriguez in a statement. 'Florida law allows the principal to suspend a student immediately pending a hearing.'

The teen who wrestled the gun away has been told he can return to school tomorrow.
