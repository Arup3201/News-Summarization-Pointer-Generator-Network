It's a big, bad world out there. But for one tiny turtle it clearly proved to be a little too frightening for exploration just yet.

The nervous creature hatched from its egg but then stayed there for two more days, peering at the outside world before finally emerging.

The
Keeled Box Turtle, which is native to south east Asia, is endangered 
due to over collection in the wild for food and the pet trade.

The little creature was hatched at the Tennessee Aquarium in America, which houses 75 different species of turtle.

The
Keeled Box Turtle has a very brittle shell and it is not uncommon for 
the parents to crush them by accident. This one broke a hole in its 
shell after a 126-day incubation period but then stayed in there for 
another two days.

Senior 
herpetologist at the aquarium Bill Hughes said: 'Unlike other endangered
turtles reared at the aquarium this year, this recent addition was 
rather slow to venture into the world.

'Spiny
Turtles just come right out, but this turtle seemed content to open one
end of the egg and look out at the world from inside the shell. This 
baby turtle hatched after an incubation period lasting 126 days.

'It stayed there for two days before emerging.'

It
is the first time that the aquarium has successfully hatched a Keeled 
Box Turtle and it is one of only about 20 in accredited zoos and 
aquariums in the entire US.

Rare: The Keeled Box Turtle, native to south east Asia, is endangered due to over collection in the wild for food and the pet trade

Keeled
Box Turtles get their common names from the three raised ridges, or 
'keels' running the length of their shells. The edge of the shell has a 
number of sharp spikes near the tail.

They are mainly carnivorous and terrestrial, living near water rather than in it and adults grow up to seven inches long.

The
species is native to China, India, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam. Like many
other Southeast Asian Turtles, keeled box Turtles have been 
over-collected in the wild for food, medicine and the pet trade.

Several
conservation organisations are working to protect the remaining wild 
populations from illegal trade, while zoos and aquariums are working 
toward increasing assurance populations in human care. This assures that
the species does not go extinct if these animals disappear in the wild.

The Tennessee Aquarium
has one of the largest turtle collections on public display with more 
than 500 individuals representing 75 species. The Aquarium now has six 
Keeled Box Turtles. There are three adults, one male and two females, 
this new baby and a pair of young Keeled Box Turtles.
