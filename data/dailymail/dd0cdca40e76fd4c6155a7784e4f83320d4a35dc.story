A woman was found guilty of culpable negligent manslaughter Friday for referring another woman to a transgendered phony nurse for illicit silicone buttocks injections that prosecutors say killed her in 2012.

Natasha Stewart, of suburban Memphis, Tenn., was found guilty Friday in Jackson, Miss., in the death of 37-year-old Karima Gordon of Atlanta, who prosecutors say died at the hands of Morris Garner, who now refers to herself as Tracey Lynn Garner after gender reassignment surgeries.

Ms Stewart had been charged with 'depraved-heart' murder, defined as a 'callous disregard for human life' resulting in death, which carries a maximum penalty of life in prison, and conspiracy to commit murder, but was found guilty of lesser charges.

Jurors ultimately also convicted Ms Stewart of conspiracy to commit culpable negligent manslaughter. She faces up to 20 years in prison for each charge. A sentencing date has not yet been set.

The former adult entertainer showed little emotion when the verdict was read. She was found not guilty on the charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.

Authorities say Stewart, also known as Pebbelz Da Model, took $200 for referring Ms Gordon to the alleged injector and falsely represented that the injector was a nurse. Miss Garner faces life in prison for her role in the scheme.

Ms Gordon died only days after the silicone used in the faulty injected found its way into her lungs.

Ms Stewart testified Friday that Ms Gordon was insecure about her body and wanted help fixing previously botched buttocks enhancements. Ms Stewart said she connected Ms Gordon with Miss Garner to help her out, not for money, but she said Ms Gordon insisted on paying her the finder's fee.

Stewart also testified that she thought the woman performing the injections at a Jackson house was indeed a registered nurse and had gotten the injections herself more than 20 times over seven years.

'She told me that she was an RN,' Ms Stewart testified.

Miss Garner is charged with depraved-heart murder in the deaths of Ms Gordon and another woman, Marilyn Hale of Selma, Ala. She has pleaded not guilty. Her trial is scheduled for March.

Emails introduced Friday in Ms Stewart's case showed that Ms Gordon was a fan of the entertainer's and was persistent in asking for help to get buttocks injections at least as far back as 2010.

The two were introduced by another woman known only as 'pebbles.'

'I won't give up my mission to ultimately achieve a tastefully great butt enhancement,' Ms Gordon wrote in one of the messages.

Anglean Barber, testified Thursday that she and Ms Gordon flew to New York to meet Ms Stewart in February 2012 and that the woman later referred them to Ms Garner.

Ms Barber said she and Ms Gordon wanted the same kind of buttocks enhancement that Ms Stewart had gotten with hopes of becoming models in the hip-hop industry.

The two women drove to Ms Garner's house in Jackson on March 16, 2012, with plans to get the injections, Ms Barber testified.

Ms Barber said she was unsettled by the supposed nurse's appearance and decided not to get the injections. Her friend Ms Gordon fell ill during the car ride back to Atlanta in the hours after the procedure.

The phony nurse then told Ms Gordon to take cough syrup during a phone call asking what was wrong, according to court documents.

A doctor testified Thursday that Ms Gordon died in a Georgia hospital on March 24, 2012, of silicone embolism in her lungs.

During closing arguments, Ms Stewart's attorney, Kevin Camp, said that the jury should find his client not guilty because 'nobody knew that this situation was going to cause any imminent death.'

Prosecutors, however, argued that Ms Stewart charged money and lied when she told Ms Gordon that the person performing the injections was a registered nurse.

The Gordon case was one of a handful that shocked the nation over the past few years. Also charged with murder were Loretta Cheek and Oneal Ron Morris, who also provided backroom cosmetic surgical procedures that killed unwitting victims.
