The results of Monday's Champions League draw may have been unsurprising to Manchester City director of football Txiki Begiristain, with his side being picked to face Barcelona at the same stage for the second year running.

Although City aren't the only English side facing familiar opposition as Chelsea must travel to Paris Saint Germain - their opponents in last season's quarter final.

With that in mind, Sportsmail brings you all you need to know about the upcoming fixtures in the last 16 of Europe's most prestigious club tournament.

Manchester City have been drawn against Barcelona in the last 16 for the second consecutive season 

Distance: 860 miles

Flight Time: 2 hrs 12 mins 

Man City wins: 0

Draws: 0

Barcelona wins: 2

Manchester City vs Barcelona: Tuesday February 24, 2015 - The Etihad Stadium (second leg: Wednesday, March 18 - Nou Camp)

MANAGER: Luis Enrique 

STAR MAN: Lionel Messi. Helped shred City’s defence when the sides met last season and can do so again. Being outshone by Cristiano Ronaldo but still has 21 goals so far this campaign.

Luis Suarez was great to watch in the Premier League and will make his return to England against City

ONE TO WATCH: Neymar. After his World Cup injury heartache, the Brazil star is taking it out on Spanish defences. He has 14 goals in 18 games this season.

FAMILIAR FACE: Luis Suarez. Back in England just months after leaving Liverpool. Suarez has taken time to settle but is now part of a fearsome attacking trio.

Last year’s last-16 tie was the first time the two sides had met. Barcelona took control in the first leg when Martin Demichelis saw red on the way to a 2-0 loss. City improved in the return match at the Nou Camp but could still only manage a 2-1 defeat. 

Ibrahimovic is an undeniable force and was on fantastic form when PSG met Barcelona at the Nou Camp

Distance: 213 miles

Flight Time: 53 mins 

Chelsea wins: 2

Draws: 1

PSG wins: 1

PSG vs Chelsea: Tuesday February 17, 2015 - Parc des Princes (second leg: Wednesday, March 11 - Stamford Bridge) 

MANAGER: Laurent Blanc

STAR MAN: Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Injured when the teams met in April but is the club’s joint-top scorer this season.

ONE TO WATCH: Lucas Moura. Lightning fast and has six goals this season, second only to Ibrahimovic and Edinson Cavani (both 12).

FAMILIAR FACE: Yohan Cabaye. Left Newcastle in January and is now one of a host of midfield options for PSG. 

The teams met in last year’s quarter final, with Chelsea going through after a 2-0 home win reversed the damage done by a 3-1 defeat in Paris. Their previous meetings came in the 2004-05 group stage during Jose Mourinho’s first spell.

Dimitar Berbatov will be one of a number of familiar faces when he returns to face Arsenal in February

Arsenal vs Monaco: Wednesday February 25, 2015 - The Emirates (second leg: Tuesday, March 17 - Stade Louis II)

MANAGER: Leonardo Jardim

Distance: 641 miles

Flight Time: 1 hr 58 mins

The sides have never met in a competitive game.

STAR MAN: Dimitar Berbatov. Not set the world alight since his January move with five goals in 17 games this season. Still a classy player, though.

ONE TO WATCH: Joao Moutinho. He and James Rodriguez cost £60m in 2013. Rodriguez has left but Moutinho still runs the Monaco midfield.

FAMILIAR FACE: Ricardo Carvalho. Former Chelsea defensive stalwart Carvalho has been at Monaco since 2013.

Joao Moutinho has been an an anchor in the centre of the park for Monoco since his move in 2013
