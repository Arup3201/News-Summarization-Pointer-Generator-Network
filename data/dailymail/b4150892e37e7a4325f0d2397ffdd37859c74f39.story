Deborah Norville is celebrating 20 years at Inside Edition - and tells how her heartbreak at being separated from her family while on the road led to her joining the show.

The mother of three freely admits she put her backpack to rest after filming one particularly gut-wrenching news story.

The two-time Emmy winner, 56, says: 'I had extra pages in my passport because I was travelling so much. I was in Brazil and my little boy called me crying 'mommy, please come home'.

'We were on a story about a woman who kidnapped back her son in violation of an agreement with her ex husband in Tunisia,' she says: 'We were with these former Delta Force commandos, all very cloak and dagger, whom she had hired after exhausting every resource, spending her last dollar and selling her furniture to finance these efforts.'

Mommy and me: Deborah Norville and her newborn daughter in 1997

Waiting for the mother and son, Deborah said they eventually arrived four hours late after being detained by the border authorities in Tunisia. She said: 'When they put the key in the motor to crank up the boat, it didn't start, they had come in on fumes.

'And that really hit me, because here I am, 5,000 miles away from my own child and this woman has given up everything to be reunited with hers. 

Happily married to husband Karl Wellner since 1987, Deborah added: 'For me, this was an epiphany, as a journalist that was a really cool story and it hit on a number of levels, but for me personally, as a mom, a woman and a wife, it was like 'what are you doing this for? when are you going to grow up?

'This is great, you're going to cool places, you're doing nifty stuff, but you have a husband and a son and you may have a two or a four-year-deal with CBS news, but you have a lifetime contract with these people, and that's when I called my agent and said 'when my deal is up I need something where I am an anchor, by anchor, I mean glued, rooted to a show.

'CBS was offering me the evening weekend anchor job, but I would have still been on the road during the week, so that's when I thanked them and went to Inside Edition.' 

The willowy blonde, who was one of Joan Rivers' best friends', started on Inside Edition, succeeding Bill O’Reilly, on March 5, 1995. 

Inside Edition remains a steady ship in the network sea, averaging 4.7 million viewers last November, second only to Entertainment Tonight.

Deborah revealed: 'I actually wrote into my contract you cannot travel more than a certain number of days, but I've never come close to that as I'm stuck in the studio!

'I thought 'If I'm going to have a long career, I need to be successful for whoever I work for, but also successful as a person'.'  

Friends in high places: Deborah Norville with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 

Beloved pal: Deborah Norville, her husband Karl Wellner and Joan Rivers. Deborah gave a eulogy at Joan's funeral following her death in September 

The young girl from Dalton, Georgia, had no expectations of a career where she would end up interviewing the British Prime Minister in front of the nation.

But from winning Junior Miss to shining as the only journalist to interview President Jimmy Carter when he returned to his home state of Georgia in 1979 when she still a college senior, it was clear that Deborah was a natural.

Her star rose, and she joined the Today show in September 1989 on the newsdesk and took over from Jane Pauley as co-anchor in October 1989.

Moments she cherishes include interviewing British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in October 1990, just weeks after Saddam Hussein had invaded Kuwait. 

'How long will we have?', the Iron Lady asked, to which Deborah replied: 'Unfortunately, Madame Prime Minister, this is live TV, so we'll have four or five minutes if we're lucky.'

'Oh, so you'd like my answers snappy', Mrs Thatcher said, and as Deborah recounts: 'She very snappily proceed to tell me that over dinner the night before, she and President George HW Bush decided while it would be nice if there was a UN resolution authorizing the invasion of Iraq, it wasn't necessary, and that Britain and the US were prepared to go in and defend Kuwait.

'As a reporter, you have moments when that bell goes off in your head, but the bell was going off around the world, on wire machines - yes, those still existed - that the US and UK were prepared to unilaterally defend Kuwait.'

'That', Deborah says, a touch modestly, 'was cool.'

But viewers quickly complained there no chemistry between Deborah and co-host Bryant Gumbel, and soon after Deborah went on maternity leave to have her first son Niki in February 1991, it was announced she would not be returning, Katie Couric taking her place instead.

Rebounding, Deborah got her own radio show with ABC radio network, which launched in September 1991 and then joined CBS news in 1993, first on Street Stories then on America Tonight.

Fascinating: For Inside Edition in 2000, Deborah Norville spent a week in prison in North Carolina 

Hard-going: Deborah said she met women with harrowing stories during her time in prison - including one teenager who had grown up with drug-addict parents and another whose teeth were rotted away due to crack

One of Deborah's most defining TV moments came when she was incarcerated for a week on Inside Edition in February 2000.

She laughed: 'The idea actually has its roots as one of the executives was a fan of the HBO show OZ and so they went to the Federal Prison system and said 'we want to put Deborah in jail' and the Federal Prison, to my everlasting gratitude, said 'no, we won't take her'.

However, the execs then called every single department of corrections 'Not even Aslaka would take me on', Deborah says: 'I thought I was off the hook!'

But they soon found a sheriff in Davidson, North Carolina, who ran what he called 'the toughest jail in America'.

Deborah said: 'He said 'she don't get out till I say she gets out!'. They put me in there for a week and it was like cuckoo land.

'There were six beds, at one point i think we were up to 18 in there. It was a real window on what American jails were like. 

Junior Miss! With a talent for sewing, Deborah Norville's road to success started when she entered the Whitfield Co. (GA) Junior Miss Pageant in 1975 - and won

Budding reporter: Deborah Norville as a young journalist 

'One woman was in there for attempted murder. The story, to hear her tell it, was that her boyfriend spontaneously combusted. The prosecution seemed to feel that gasoline and a match were somehow involved.'

A teenager, who had grown up in a house with crack-addict parents who had once sold her bedroom furniture for drugs, was in armed robbery with intent to kill to fund her own drug addiction. She thought that LSD was not a drug.

Deborah said: 'There was another woman, she pulled her mouth back and she showed me where her molars should have been, but the dental material was all gone and nothing was left by the fillings which is what crack will do, it's same as meth mouth. I'm pretty sure she lost brain material as well.'

Admitting it was a 'high impact stunt', Deborah said: 'I'll be damned if I'll let them make me a pawn in a stunt. I wanted there to be some journalism there, and in fact at that point, when they put me in jail, the jail population in America was rising at a rate of nine per cent a year, that's staggering.

'And I was able to show there's nothing happening in jail that's going to prevent any of these people from doing any of the activities that got them there in the first place.' 

As for the future, Deborah said: 'I love what I do, we do great work at Inside Edition - and here's to another 20 years!'

Today anchor: Deborah Norville rose to the ranks of the Today show co-anchor, seen here with fellow co-anchor Bryant Gumbel. She left the NBC show in 1991 soon after the birth of her first son
