More than a dozen people have been injured in an explosion at a Massachusetts a gentlemen's club.

The multistory building in Springfield was leveled and numerous other properties were damaged in the blast that was felt miles away and sent bricks and glass flying through downtown streets.

Firefighters were called to the building at around 4:20pm to investigate a gas leak but 40 minutes after they arrived the building blew up.

No one was killed in the explosion, according to a spokesman for Springfield Mayor Domenic Sarno.

At least 16 people, including firefighters, a police officer and gas company employees, were being evaluated at Baystate Medical Center and another nearby hospital.

None of the victims had critical injuries and none of the injuries were burns.

A hospital spokesman said that the worst injuries at this time appear to be facial cuts, but they are worried about some concussions. One firefighter had fallen into a nearby manhole following the blast.

Emergency crews evacuated the area, which is filled with homes and businesses, including the Scores Gentlemen's Club.

Scores of people were forced to leave a six-story apartment building that was buckling after the blast.

The explosion in a downtown area of 
Springfield, 90 miles west of Boston, blew out all windows in a 
three-block radius, leaving three more buildings damaged beyond repair.

Police Sgt. John Delaney described the devastation left by the gas blast as looking like a 'missile strike.'

Massachusetts Lt. Gov. Tim Murray said it was 'a miracle' no one was killed.

Area resident Wayne Davis, who lives a block away, said he felt his apartment building shake.

'I was laying down in bed, and I started feeling the building shaking and creaking,' he said.

The Navy veteran said the boom from the explosion was louder than anything he'd ever heard, including the sound of a jet landing on an aircraft carrier.

Another Springfield resident, who witnessed the blast from a barbershop, told WWLP-TV he heard a loud explosion that knocked him off his feet. He said he looked up the street and saw one building severely damaged.

Firefighters say they're investigating how the blast happened.
