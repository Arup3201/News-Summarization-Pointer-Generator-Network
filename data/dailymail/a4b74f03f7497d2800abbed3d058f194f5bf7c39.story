An ambulance crew took forty-one minutes to reach a critically ill six week old baby because they finished their break before responding to the emergency 999 call.

Thomas Passant died for four minutes after suffering a cardiac arrest and he continues to fight for his life at Birmingham Children's Hospital two weeks after he stopped breathing and started to turn blue at his home.

The child has endured 14 hours of open heart surgery in 11 days since his parents' emergency call to West Midlands Ambulance Service - and now faces a potential life of disability.

His grandfather, Paul Passant, a former fireman from Bridgnorth, Wolverhampton, has 
now vowed to 'fight until his last breath' to improve ambulance services
so no family ever have to endure the same heartache.

Ambulance bosses have now confirmed that the mercy crew which responded to the family's 999 call could not be dispatched until they had finished their break.

They had opted to take 'undisturbed breaks', which meant they did not show up on the operator's system at the time.

Mr Passant, a 56 year-old fire risk assessor, said: 'I understand that they have got to have breaks, but, if years ago when I was a fire officer, I had sat outside someone's burning house and told them I was just going to finish my sandwich, I don't think they would have been at all pleased.

'They knew how critically ill Thomas was and how important time was. I think it's disgusting.'

A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service said: 'The crews work 12-hour shifts and obviously have the right to a meal break. Individual staff can request that their break is not disturbed, meaning that they will not show up as an available ambulance to send to jobs. The service is duty bound to honour that choice.

'The crew that was sent to Thomas was on an undisturbed break when the 999 call came through. As soon as it was over, they were shown as available and sent to Bridgnorth.'

Mr Passant spent much of Christmas drumming up support for his Return Our Ambulance Service to Bridgnorth campaign which he said he promised Thomas he would win while his grandson was on a life support machine.

He spent nine days - including Christmas Eve night - to get people to sign his petition and has collected around 2,000 signatures in just nine days.

He said he does not want another family to suffer such heartache.

He said: 'It is always going to be in
our minds that the damage that has been done to Thomas's heart was 
caused by the hold-up of the ambulance service.

'My grandson will have a disability and he's going to miss out on so much. It is breaking our hearts.

'If we had an ambulance in Bridgnorth he could have been in hospital in half an hour.

'He wouldn't have gone into cardiac arrest, and he wouldn't have gone into respiratory arrest in the ambulance on the way over.

'I
won't stop. I promised Thomas when he was fighting for his life on a 
machine that I will fight until my last breath so another family will 
not have to go through what we have gone through. I feel the service 
Thomas got was what you'd expect in a third world country.'

'There
are days when we don't have any paramedic cover in Bridgnorth at all. 
People are really angry. The support I have had from the whole town is 
amazing.'

Thomas has endured 14 hours of open heart surgery in 11 days since his parents emergency call to West Midlands Ambulance Service

Surrounded by tubes, Thomas has two injections every day to prevent another devastating blood clot from developing on his heart.

Now aged eight weeks, his sports-loving family have been told that he will never be able to kick a ball around with his friends or take part in any contact sport.

His parents, Kate Oram and Matthew, dialled 999 at 12.47pm on December 17 from their home in Bridgnorth, Shrosphire.

The family waited for 15 minutes for help from a community paramedic, despite living just 300 yards away from the mercy base in Stourbridge Road, where the family claim 24/7 cover was promised when the town's ambulance station was closed in April.

They say there was no-one working in Bridgnorth so a community paramedic had to travel from nearby Tweedale.

It took until 13.28pm for an ambulance to respond to their life-saving call because it had to travel from Donnington.

Thomas was initially taken to Princess Royal Hospital in Telford.

Mr Passant said: 'Thomas was struggling to breathe and his breathing was really rapid. You could see his little chest going up and down, and he was going blue at the lips.

'As soon as he got into the Princess Royal Hospital he went into cardiac arrest and Kate, Matthew and my wife Christine watched for three hours as anaesthetists desperately tried to provide him with oxygen. There was blood pouring out of his mouth. It was the most awful thing to witness.'

Doctors at the Telford hospital spent eight hours stabilising Thomas before he was transferred to Birmingham Children's Hospital.

The next day he underwent his first six hours of open-heart surgery, and two more the day after, as doctors closed his tiny chest back up.

But the family's heartache was far from over.

A week after his first operation doctors discovered a leak in one of Thomas's heart valves had worsened and that the already weak baby would need to go back under the knife.

'We thought he was doing really well but then he took a turn for the worse,' Paul said.

'Two doctors were trying to get lines into him with drugs and adrenaline but they couldn't get them into his little arms or legs.

The family still have a pile of unopened Christmas presents ready to open with baby Thomas

'In the end they managed to get two canulas into his head and it was a good job because he crashed right at that moment.'

Thomas was taken in for four more hours of surgery to replace his mitral valve with an artificial valve and then endured another two hours to close his chest again.

He will need a further operation around the age of 12 to have the artificial valve replaced with a larger one as he grows.

'I had a little, weak smile off him the other day and it was just heartbreaking,' Mr Passant said. 'He's been through such a lot but he's a real fighter.'

Mr Passant said the ambulance response time was slower than that of a vet attending his elderly mother's dog Oscar.

He added: 'It's absolutely ridiculous that a vet can get to a sick dog within 15 minutes but it takes them almost an hour to get a baby to hospital.'

The family have also started raising funds for Birmingham Children's Hospital and GBP450 has already been donated to their appeal from a quiz night at the Crown Hotel in Bridgnorth.

A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service said: 'Due to the level of demand at the time of the call, every ambulance in Shropshire was committed to a patient.

'The Community Paramedic arrived 15 minutes after the start of the call and began to treat the boy.

'Throughout all this time, the control room continued to search for an available ambulance.

'It is also important to note that at the time of the call to Stourbridge Road, an elderly woman who had suffered a stroke in Bridgnorth, was already being tended to by an ambulance crew and was taken to Princess Royal Hospital, becoming available at 1.42pm.

'There would not have been an ambulance available in Bridgnorth and an ambulance would have been called in from elsewhere to tend to the boy. The response would not have been quicker; it could even have been longer.'Â
