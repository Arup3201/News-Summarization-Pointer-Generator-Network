A former hedge fund boss is taking 
the biggest gamble of his life by opening the country’s newest and 
largest vineyard – with plans to produce one million bottles of fizz a 
year.

Mark Driver, 47, and a team of 30, 
will attempt to take on the French at their own game, producing quality 
sparkling wine to rival the best Champagne has to offer.

His picturesque 400-acre plot, 
nestled on a south-facing slope, near the coast at Alfriston, East 
Sussex, is just 88 miles as the crow flies from Champagne in France, and has a very 
similar soil and climate.

The Rathfinny Estate will be one of 
the largest single site vineyards in Europe and aims to capitalise on 
the booming demand - both nationally and internationally - for high 
quality English sparkling wine.

England currently produces only four million bottles of wine each year - which is actually less than we consume each day.

Mr Driver, father-of-four, said: 'A 
lot of people don’t realise that English wine producers are making some 
of the best sparkling wine in the world. Ridgeview, another local Sussex
producer, won the prestigious Decanter award in 2010 for its sparkling 
wine, the first time the award has been won outside of France.

'So, we know it can be done. We hope that opening such a large operation will help put English wine on the map.

'I want Rathfinny to be sold not just
in the best restaurants in London, but in Paris, New York, Beijing and 
Hong Kong as well,’ he said.

He said that his aim was to produce 
sparkling wine that compared favourably with the likes of Bollinger and 
Pol Roger, with a retail price of around £25 to £26. He said they would 
be using the same methods and grapes as they do in Champagne, so the 
wine should be similar, although a touch fruitier.

Mr Driver, whose usual dress as a 
stockbroker and then co-manager of a hedge fund, was a suit and tie, now
finds he spends a lot of time traipsing about in wellies on his 400 
acre site, which he bought in October 2010. His ambitious plans are even
more astounding, considering that he is in the middle of a degree – in 
wine-making.

'I was lucky enough to be able to 
step down from my job and venture into something new. I’ve always been 
interested in wine, I’ve drunk a lot of it over the years, and I have a 
small, but growing, collection. It was from a personal interest that I 
decided to consider the idea of a vineyard

'The other students find it very 
amusing that I am opening up the largest vineyard in the country, when I
haven’t even finished my studies,’ said Mr Driver. 'However, I think 
they believe it is great news for the industry and for them as I may be 
employing some of them in the future.’

Mr Driver said that he hadn’t 
anticipated buying land until after his degree at Plumpton College, but 
when the Rathfinny estate came up for sale the opportunity was too good 
to miss.

'We were originally looking for a 250
acre site, because we wanted the vineyard to be commercially viable, 
not just a hobby, so we needed a large plot of land. When this farm came
up, we jumped at it.

'We were incredibly lucky, as sites 
like this do not come up for sale very often in this part of the world,’
said Mr Driver, who is employing 30 people full-time and will need up 
to 200 seasonal workers to help pick the grapes.

Vision: This ruined farmhouse will be restored to its former glory and used as accommodation for workers when they come to pick the grapes

Mists and mellow fruitfulness: Mr Driver said the chance to buy the Rathfinny estate was too good an opportunity to miss

The planting of the four varieties of grapes - Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier and Riesling –started this week.

Around 50 acres of grapes will be planted a year until 2020, when the full 400 acres will be under vine.

The first still wine could appear as early as next year, with sparkling hitting the shelves in 2016 or 2017.

'We will produce small amounts of 
still wine, but this is going to be a predominately sparkling wine 
vineyard.

High quality Sussex sparkling wine requires at least three 
years of bottle fermentation, so everyone will have to be patient while 
they wait,' said Mr Driver.

To help him with the wine production,
Cameron Roucher, estate manager at Rathfinny, moved 12,000 miles from 
New Zealand to be part of the ambitious project.

'You couldn’t really 
ask for a better location than this for growing sparkling wine grapes. 
The soil, the climate, the geography - they are all perfect,’ he said.

A state-of-the-art winery will be 
completed by the summer of 2013. A staff hostel is also being built to 
accommodate seasonal workers, who will be needed during harvest and 
during the winter to maintain the vines.

The hostel, which uses reclaimed old flint barns, is due to be completed in time for the winter of next year.

Rathfinny has also hired Jonathan 
Médard, a renowned French winemaker, who has spent the last ten years 
working in California, to oversee the design and construction of the new
winery as well as make all of the wines.

Joining Mark and Sarah Driver on the project are Cameron Roucher from New Zealand as vineyard manager and Frenchman Jonathan Medard, winemaker

'The soil, the climate, the geography - they are all perfect, says estate manager Cameron Roucher

Working with Natural England and the 
National Trust, a programme of improvements is being made to enhance the
local natural habitat while reviving and reclaiming the natural chalk 
grass downland and creating wildlife corridors to improve biodiversity.

A
new walk, the Rathfinny Trail, is being established, allowing the 
public access to parts of the Estate.

One of Rathfinny’s aims is to provide a sustainable built infrastructure to support the vineyard.

Buildings feature locally-sourced oak
and flint. A renewable energy strategy is being implemented based on 
photovoltaic cells so that each building is energy self-sufficient.

Ground water is being sourced from the Estate’s own bore hole, purified to removed calcium and microbes.

Can we compare? The vineyards of Ville Dommange, in the Champagne region of France are about to face competition from English sparkling wine

The waste water used within the wine 
making process will be treated on site and released back onto the land. 
New windbreaks using indigenous hedge plants and trees are being grown 
to manage the micro-conditions on the slopes of the vineyard.

Rathfinny is also funding the 
construction of a new Wine Research Centre at Plumpton College, part of 
Brighton University, to support the development of skills that the 
English wine industry will require as it grows.

Mr Driver said: 'The Rathfinny 
project is not just about making wine: we are committed to supporting 
the wider ambitions of the English wine industry and that means 
nurturing the skills it requires to fulfill its potential.

'You’ll find that every major wine 
area is supported by a research centre, which is why I was so keen to 
invest in one at Plumpton. We will need skilled workers in this area as 
the industry takes off.

'I do believe we are at the beginning
of an emerging industry in southern England and I know the local people
here are very supportive of what we are trying to do. We have also had 
encouragement from other local wine producers too. All we need to do is 
convince people in London and across the country to buy English.’

As for the winemakers across the Channel, they are 'intrigued’ to see what we are doing here, said Mr Driver.

'Several French vineyard owners are trying to purchase or rent land here because it is much cheaper than in Champagne.’

Now, all there is to do for Mark and his wife Sarah, is to watch the grapes grow and cross their fingers for some good weather.

So, as a former stockbroker and hedge fund manager, how risky is this venture?

'Of course, we have done a lot of 
research, we know the land is perfect for sparkling wine, we’ve brought 
in some experts to help, and we’re feeling very confident. But of 
course, the one thing we can’t control is the vagaries of the English 
weather,’ he said.
