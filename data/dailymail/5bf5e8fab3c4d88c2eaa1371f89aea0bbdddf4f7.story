Donelle Trotman, a father-of-two in his thirties from New York's Staten Island, underwent a series of tests by doctors who couldn't figure out his mysterious symptoms - major weight gain concentrated only to his upper body, as well as skin problems and crippling fatigue - but it was a medical intern who solved the riddle when he noticed unusual tell-tale stretch marks on his arms.

Luckily for Mr Trotman, who told Today he had never been 'skinny', but never been 'overweight' before got sick, surgery to remove the mass was successful, and doctors expect him to make a full recovery within a year.

Mr Trotman first starting gaining weight three years ago. He was 180lbs when he was 18, but after his illness took hold, he rocketed up to 366lbs.

Cushing's disease is caused by a tumor on the pituitary gland, located at the base of the brain.

It triggers excess levels of the steroid cortisol to be released in the body.

Symptoms include upper body obesity, a swollen face, acne, skin bruising and purple stretch marks.

Untreated, Cushing's disease can be fatal, but the prognosis is good if the growth is surgically removed in time.

The disease affects fewer than 50,000 people in the U.S. each year.

'I doubled, like, I got a whole person on me,' he said. 'It was just specific places; my stomach, under my arms, my back of my neck, my face, the bottom of my back.

'My legs stayed the same for a long time.'

Despite running and lifting weights, he continued to expand, and was soon so tired all the time that even chewing left him out of breath.

Unbeknownst to Mr Trotman, the tumor on his pituitary gland was causing his brain to produce vast amounts of a natural steroid called cortisol.

Mr Trotman went to New York's Lennox Hill hospital after he started experiencing double vision, but a slew of tests got doctors nowhere.

It was a medical intern who one day noticed his unusual stretch marks and suggested he could be suffering from Cushing's disease, which affects fewer than 50,000 people in the U.S. each year, and is fatal unless treated in time.

Clue: Mr Trotman underwent a series of tests by doctors, but it was a medical intern who solved the mystery when he noticed unusual tell-tale stretch marks on Mr Trotman's arms

Since undergoing surgery to remove the growth, Mr Trotman has been gradually losing weight and returning to normal.

'It's wonderful,' he says. 'Every day it's just like I feel a little stronger.'

There is an eight to ten per cent chase the disease will return, but if so, Mr Trotman will be able to catch it quickly.
