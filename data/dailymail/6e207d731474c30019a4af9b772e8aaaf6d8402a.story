A doctor has accused her surgeon husband of sexual assault after he allegedly slipped her a powerful sedative, a court heard today.

Dr Alonna Norberg testified that Dr Jon 
Norberg told her the drug was Diprivan - and that she did not know it 
was another name for propofol, a strong anesthetic.

Propofol gained notoriety in the trial of Conrad Murray, the doctor convicted in the death of pop star Michael Jackson.

On the stand: Dr Alonna Norberg testified in a North Dakota court today that her husband Dr Jon Norberg drugged and sexually assaulted her at their home in Fargo, North Dakota

Alonna Norberg said she wasn't practicing medicine at the time and only found out later that propofol and Diprivan are the same product.

She told the court in Fargo, North Dakota, that her husband 
gave her the drug three times via an intravenous chest tube in 2010 because she was in chronic pain.

Last week, she told the court that it was 'true horror' when she awoke in June last year to find she was unable to breathe because her husband was engaged in oral sex with her, according to the Grandforksherald.com.

'I felt like I was choking and it was like I was suffocating,' Alonna she said, adding that moments later she blacked out.

She said she never consented for him to give her the drug nor did she consent to have sex while she was taking it.

Mr Norberg, an orthopedic hand surgeon, 
has pleaded not guilty to charges of felony gross sexual imposition for 
which he could serve life in prison.

The surgeon is also charged with reckless endangerment for which he could spend five years in jail.

Dr Jon Norberg says his wife made up 
the story to use in a looming divorce and child custody case.

He also 
said that she made the allegations up to detract from her psychiatric 
issues and dependency on prescription drugs.

His defense attorney Robert Hoy questioned Alonna Norberg's credibility during cross-examination saying that she took dozens of pain and sleeping medications.

The trial is expected to last for two weeks.
