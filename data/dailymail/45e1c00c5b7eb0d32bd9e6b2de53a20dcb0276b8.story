It may be called 'Scotchy Scotch Scotch' but, alas, there is no actual alcohol in the new Ben & Jerry's that has both cult comedy lovers and sweettooths alike licking their lips.

In celebration of the long-awaited release of Will Ferrell's Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues (released in theatres Dec. 20), the iconic ice cream makers today launched a special flavor dedicated to San Diego's most hapless TV anchor, Ron Burgundy.

The latest in a recent spate of special edition releases, the creamy concoction is described as 'butterscotch ice cream with ribbons of butterscotch swirl' and is completely whiskey-free.

Fans of the original, Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy - which has become one of the most-quoted comedies since its release in 2004 - will be quick to recall the name  of the dessert comes from a memorable scene from the gag reel where Ferrell's beloved character is drinking on-air.

'I love scotch. Scotchy scotch scotch. Here it goes down, down into my belly,' Burgundy says.

Officially unveiled this morning at New York City's Pier 36, Burgundy 'himself' is quoted on the press release as saying he hopes Ben and Jerry's consider his other suggestions.

'Malt liquor marshmallow, well liquor bourbon peanut butter and cheap white wine sherbert,' the release said.

The launch event featured a performance by Nutty The Water-skiing Squirrel, another standout from the original movie, followed by the appearance of a ice cream truck that had been converted into a Channel 4 news truck.

Inside the truck were a scrum of Ron Burgundy lookalikes that served samples of the ice cream.

'We especially enjoyed the sampling process over the last several months to find the perfect Scotchy Scotch Scotch flavor,' said Ben & Jerry's marketing head, Lisa Sholk.

Ben & Jerry's are no strangers to bringing out limited batches, although their most recent efforts have been based on enforcing civil rights.

Earlier this year in Australia, the company renamed their legendary Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough to 'I Dough, I Dough' as a stance on marriage equality.

Since their launch 35 years ago, Ben & Jerry's have become known for such advocacy.

In 1989 they were one of the first companies in the US to extend full benefits to unmarried partners of their partners, including those of the same sex.

In 2009 the flavor known as 'Chubby Hubby' was renamed 'Hubby Hubby' to celebrate gay marriage legalisation in Ben & Jerry's home state of Vermont.

Then last year in the UK they launched Apple-y Ever After' to support same-sex marriage legislation.

'As a social justice company, we’re immensely proud to support an issue that embodies so many of our core values,' Ben & Jerry's brand champion Kalli Swaik said at the time.

'We champion equality above all else, believing that everyone in a loving relationship should be able to mark their commitment to each other in marriage, regardless of gender or sexual orientation.'

'Scotchy Scotch Scotch' will be available at Ben & Jerry's stores for the next few weeks.
