The woman hired to clean up Rutgers' scandal-scarred athletic program quit her job at Tennessee 16 years ago over accusations that she put her volleyball team through a storm of humiliation and fear, a scathing report has claimed.

Julie Hermann, who was hired as Rutgers' athletic director on May 15, was reportedly the subject of a letter from former players who said she ruled through humiliation, fear and emotional abuse.

'The mental cruelty that we as a team 
have suffered is unbearable,' the players said about Hermann, 
Rutgers' new athletic director who had served as the No. 2 
athletic administrator at Louisville.

Under the microscope: Julie Hermann, Rutgers' new athletic director, says she doesn't remember the letter that accused her of taking jabs at her former volleyball players' weight, and calling them whores and learning disabled

The Star-Ledger reported Saturday night on its website yesterday that all 15 of the Tennessee team members said Hermann called them 'whores, alcoholics and learning disabled.'

They wrote: 'It has been unanimously decided that this is an irreconcilable issue.'

The players told The Star-Ledger that Hermann absorbed the words and said: 'I choose not to coach you guys.'

The 49-year-old Hermann, set to take over the Rutgers' program June 17, told The Star-Ledger she didn't remember the letter.

The newspaper said that when it was read to her by phone Wednesday, she replied, 'Wow.'

Hermann, the first woman to head Rutgers' athletic program and one of three female ADs at the 124 schools that make up college football's top tier, has promised a restart for the program following the ouster of its men's basketball coach and the resignation of other officials.

She is set to replace Tim Pernetti, who quit last month after the firing of basketball coach Mike Rice.

Axed: Former Rutgers coach Mike Rice was fired on April 3 after a video emerged of him shoving players and berating them with insults and gay slurs

Angry: The video, which was screened by ESPN, showed several moments when Mr Rice angrily pushed, shoved and grabbed his players during practices

Admission: Tim Pernetti, pictured right with Rice, has admitted that his decision to suspend Rice in December - and not fire him - was the wrong move

The video showed numerous clips of Rice firing basketballs at players, hitting them in the back, legs, feet and shoulders.

It also showed him grabbing players by their jerseys and yanking them around the court. Rice can also be heard yelling obscenities and using anti-gay slurs.

The controversy went public in April when ESPN aired the videos and Rutgers President Robert Barchi admitted he didn't view the video in the fall.

Rice was fired and Pernetti, assistant 
coach Jimmy Martelli and interim senior vice president and university 
counsel John Wolf resigned.

Whistleblower: The video was provided to ESPN by Eric Murdock, a former NBA player who also served as Rutgers' director of player development from 2010-2012

Anger: In this clip, Mr Rice, in white, is seen gesturing aggressively towards one of the Rutgers players

Slurs: In one portion of the video, Rice unloads a homophobic rant against one of his players, saying: 'You f***ing fairy! You're a f***ing f****t!'Â 

After a series of interviews with many of the former Tennessee players about Hermann, The Star-Ledger said: 'Their accounts depict a coach who thought nothing of demeaning them, who would ridicule and laugh at them over their weight and their performances, sometimes forcing players to do 100 sideline pushups during games, who punished them after losses by making them wear their workout clothes inside out in public or not allowing them to shower or eat, and who pitted them against one another, cutting down particular players with the whole team watching, and through gossip.

'Several women said playing for Hermann had driven them into depression and counseling, and that her conduct had sullied the experience of playing Division I volleyball.'

The Star-Ledger asked Hermann about the players' lingering grievances.

'I never heard any of this, never name-calling them or anything like that whatsoever,' she told the newspaper. 'None of this is familiar to me.'

Rutgers will join the Big Ten in 2014.

When push comes to shove: Pernetti insisted yesterday that he issued an 'appropriate' suspension after he was shown the tape and conducted an investigation into the matter
