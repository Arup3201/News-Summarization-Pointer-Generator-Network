US tycoon Donald Trump's first Scottish boutique hotel has been given the highest possible rating by tourism body VisitScotland.

Macleod House and Lodge, located next to the Trump International Golf Links course in Balmedie, Aberdeenshire, has been awarded five star status.

The sprawling mansion, which has been extensively renovated to turn it into a 19 bedroom luxury hotel, sits just a hundred yards from the tycoon's championship 18-hole links course.

Sarah Malone, Executive Vice President of Trump International, said they were ‘thrilled’ to be given the top rating for accommodation in Scotland.

She said: ‘Mr Trump has invested millions in the renovation and restoration of a really important, historic building in the north-east of Scotland.

‘It is right in the heart of our estate.

‘We've built this entire service from scratch and we pride ourselves on hiring the best staff possible - those that have a natural aptitude for hospitality.

‘We want to take care of the whole guest experience and pay attention to the smallest of details.

‘We know that the standards with VisitScotland are very high so we are thrilled that they have recognised us with the highest award.’

Macleod House and Lodge was opened with little fanfare at the end of 2013, but has seen a steady stream of guests - including Mr Trump himself and his golfing friends from America.

And when the Scottish Open was hosted at Royal Aberdeen earlier this year, the hotel welcomed world class golfers including Justin Rose, Phil Mickelson and Rory McIlroy.

The spacious mansion house has been carefully restored and upgraded to offer the highest level of guest accommodation, dining, bar and lounge facilities.

As well as vast rooms featuring period pieces and bathrooms decked out in Italian marble, the opulent hotel features a number of other features.

The restaurant and bar offer a wide range of options that were highly praised by VisitScotland - giving Macleod House top marks for food and beverages.

Ms Malone said: ‘We believe we have the best in Scotland on our doorsteps and it's all those little things that make the difference. It all adds up.

‘We are absolutely delighted for the team that work around the clock, this is great recognition for them and their hard work.’

And Ms Malone said that this winter should see work start on a permanent clubhouse at the golf course.

The building would replace the current temporary clubhouse set up after the course opened two years ago.

Philip Smith, VisitScotland's regional director, said the five star status gave visitors the assurance that they would get a top-notch experience.

Mr Smith said: ‘Golf tourism is hugely important to the region - and indeed Scotland - and I would like to congratulate everyone at Trump International Golf Links on this marvellous achievement.

‘Five-star status shows visitors, many of whom come from overseas, that they can expect a fantastic and enjoyable experience.’

The Trump International Golf Links course opened in July 2012 and is now in its second full season of play.

Mr Trump previously vowed to halt all further developments on the 200-acre resort, collectively known as the Menie Estate, until a final decision was made on an offshore windfarm near the site.

The property developer insists the proposed 11-turbine windfarm would spoil the view from his links golf course.

But he made the decision to carry on with plans to build a permanent clubhouse earlier this year despite losing his battle to block the windfarm being built.

The billionaire said it would be ‘disrespectful’ not to go ahead with building the £5million pound clubhouse, which is expected to be completed by late spring/early summer 2015.
