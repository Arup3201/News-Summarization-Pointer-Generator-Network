He was one of Britain’s best-loved comedians, not to mention a favourite of the Queen.

But Tommy Cooper’s legion of fans may struggle to see the funny side of a new drama film – which depicts the legendary fez-wearing entertainer as a violent alcoholic.

Tommy Cooper: Not Like That, Like This will be broadcast on ITV on Monday evening to mark the 30th anniversary of the star’s death.

But rather than focus on his career, the two-hour biopic concentrates on his 17-year affair with his assistant Mary Fieldhouse, his battle with alcoholism and episodes of domestic violence.

The drama, written by Simon Nye who penned 1990s sitcom Men Behaving Badly, stars Shameless actor David Threlfall as Cooper, and is the most high-profile film to focus on the comedian’s private life.

In one scene, Cooper and his wife Gwen, who is played by actress Amanda Redman, are shown having a drunken brawl in the street after she suspects he is having an affair – during which he is shown punching her in the face.

Later in the programme his mistress is shown with a bruise on her cheek after refusing to give him more alcohol after a night of heavy drinking.

However, both Nye and Miss Redman have defended the film, saying it is ‘respectful’ to Cooper.

It is also understood that the comedian’s daughter Vicky helped with the research for the drama, and gave it her blessing.

Nye said Cooper’s violence towards his wife and mistress, along with his reputation as a big drinker, are all well-known.

Asked if he felt any reservations about including the scenes of domestic violence because of the comic’s status as a national treasure, the writer said: ‘It’s on record, it is not something that we invented. So I hope that we did it in a delicate way and didn’t make it unnecessary.

‘You don’t want people who don’t know Tommy’s comedy to go away thinking he was a wife-beater. But he was physical, and he was physical with his wife, who gave as good as she got.

‘So that relationship worked and he did try to replicate that in a way with Mary, and she wasn’t the same person, so it looked actually worse than it was.

‘Drink was obviously a huge influence, and although he got very good at handling his drink, the quantities were enormous.’

Cooper died of a heart attack live on stage in front of millions of viewers, during a performance on the London Weekend Television variety show at Her Majesty’s Theatre in 1984, when he was aged just 63.

During his career he developed an alcohol problem while struggling to deal with stage fright.

Miss Redman, 56, said she hoped the drama will not upset the comedian’s fans, adding: ‘We’ve tried to be respectful and not dishonour Tommy. We see the stress the man was under and the fact that he did indeed love two people at the same time. It might be hard to grasp, but he did.

‘Some viewers may be quite shocked by this and think, “I’m seeing him in a new light”, but that would be a shame.

‘It doesn’t detract from what he was to the public – one of our greatest comedians.’

Clive Greenaway, who runs the Tommy Cooper Fan Club, said yesterday: ‘The film will obviously be dramatised. I haven’t seen it, but I don’t think they needed to go down that road.

‘They could have celebrated his life and career, which saw him become one of Britain’s highest-paid entertainers. He was a favourite of the Queen.’
