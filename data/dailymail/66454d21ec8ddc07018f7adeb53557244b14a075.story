It was one of the deadliest attacks during World War Two leaving more than 100,000 people dead and destroying large parts of Tokyo but is often forgotten from history.

Now 70 years on, new before and after pictures have been released showing how the Japanese capital recovered after the firebomb strike that killed more than Nagasaki in a single night.

On March 10, 1945, U.S. B-29 bombers flew over Tokyo in the dead of night, dumping massive payloads of cluster bombs.

The raids left a fifth of Tokyo smouldering under an expanse of charred bodies and rubble.

Around 104,500 people died in the attack, making it the deadliest conventional air raid ever, worse than Nagasaki and on par with Hiroshima.

But the attack, and similar ones that followed in more than 60 other Japanese cities, have received little attention and were eclipsed by the atomic bombings and Japan's postwar rush to rebuild.

Where earlier raids targeted aircraft factories and military facilities, the Tokyo firebombing was aimed largely at civilians, in places including Tokyo's downtown Shitamachi area, where people lived in traditional wood and paper homes at densities sometimes exceeding 100,000 people per square mile.

Exhausted residents also chose to pull blankets over their heads and sleep when air-raid sirens blew instead of heading to shelters turned icy by an unusually cold winter.

Haruyo Nihei, was just eight when the bombs fell and was among many survivors who kept silent about that night until recently.

A half-century passed before she even shared her experiences with her own son.

Despite the massive bombing campaign, the Kamiya Bar, left, and the Matsuya Asakusa department store, right, remained standing 

Today, the bar and the department store still remain as commuters in Tokyo cross the road outside the two buildings, which are still in use 

She said: 'Our parents would just say, "That's a different era."

'They wouldn't talk about it. And I figured my own family wouldn't understand.' 

Ms Nihei, now 78, was mesmerised as she watched the attack from a railway embankment.

She added: 'It was a blazing firestorm. I saw a baby catch fire on its mother's back. and she couldn't put out the fire.

'I saw a horse being led by its owner. The horse balked and the cargo on its back caught fire, then its tail, and it burned alive, as the owner just stood there and burned with it.'

Masaharu Ohtake, then 13, fled his family's noodle shop with a friend.

Turned back by firefighters, they headed toward Tokyo Bay and again were ordered back and they crouched in a factory yard, waiting as flames consumed their neighborhood.

He explained: 'We saw a fire truck heaped with a mountain of bones. It was hard to understand how so many bodies could be piled up like that.'

Survivors also speak of the hush as dawn broke over a wasteland of corpses and debris, studded by chimneys of bathhouses and small factories.

It estimated that 333,000 people were killed in total, including the 80,000 killed in the August 6 Hiroshima atomic-bomb attack and 40,000 at Nagasaki three days later.

The bombing campaign set a military precedent for targeting civilian areas that persisted into the Korean and Vietnam wars and beyond. But the non-atomic attacks have been largely overlooked.

Mark Selden, a Cornell University history professor said: 'Both governments, the press, media, radio, even novelists... decided the crucial story was the atomic bomb.

'This allowed them to avoid addressing some very important questions.' 

Destruction: The Matsuya Asakusa department store days after the firebomb campaign saw 2,000 tonnes of explosives dropped on Tokyo 

Exactly 70 years ago on March 9, 1945, American warplanes launched a huge firebomb campaign against Japan by dropping 2,000 tonnes of explosives over Tokyo.

The raids targeted a 16 square mile area across the Japanese capital, killing 104,500 civilians, making it the deadliest conventional air raid ever.

The campaign began early on March 9, when U.S. Air Force crews met on islands off the coast of Japan for a military briefing.

The plan was to attack Tokyo at a low level that evening using aircraft that were stripped of all of their guns.

The decrease in weight meant that the planes were able to increase their bomb load capacity and speed when flying.

It is believed that U.S. General Curtis LeMay said they were going to deliver a 'big firecracker'.

The firebombing was aimed largely at civilians, in places including Tokyo's downtown Shitamachi area, where people lived in traditional wood and paper homes at densities sometimes exceeding 100,000 people per square mile.

Around 334 bombers were used in the raid and exhausted residents chose to pull blankets over their heads and sleep when air-raid sirens blew instead of heading to shelters turned icy by an unusually cold winter.

This meant that there was huge human carnage with the smell of burning flesh even making the pilots grab oxygen masks to stop themselves from vomiting.

From January 1944 to August 1945, the U.S. dropped 157,000 tons of bombs on Japanese cities, according to the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey.

It estimated that 333,000 people were killed, including the 80,000 killed in the August 6 Hiroshima atomic-bomb attack and 40,000 at Nagasaki three days later.
