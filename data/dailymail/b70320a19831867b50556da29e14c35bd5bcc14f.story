Olympic athletes are providing fitness data in exchange for high-tech gadgets that record sleep, diet and exercise patterns to help improve their performance.

Health technology companies are using the athletes’ results to develop tracking devices for the burgeoning fitness and weightloss markets.

The track cycling team from the US are testing a sleep monitor, a glucose monitor - which can help diabetics manage blood sugar - and genetic reports on their nutritional needs and muscular capacity.

Setting records: Athletes taking part in the Games are sharing information on their sleep, diet and exercise patterns to help improve fitness gadgets

The companies are hoping the Games will increase the exposure for their products, many of which have only been recently developed.

Sky Christopherson is a consultant to the 
team and founder of the Optimized Athlete - which analyses patterns in health data to improve athletes' results.

He told Mail Online: 'We provide valuable feedback 
to the companies regarding feature requests that the athletes might 
have.

'Our focus is generating insights 
about how all components of performance are interrelated so we can 
identify patterns leading to highly individualised training plans.

'Ultimately our goal is to apply these insights to consumers to help with breakthroughs in health and fitness.'

He discovered there was an optimum 
amount of deep sleep associated with more powerful performances on the 
bike track, and has recommended night-time snacks that do not cause big fluctuations in blood sugar levels.

DexCom has donated its
 continuous glucose monitors to several US athletes.

President Kevin Sayer told the FInancial Times: 'These are early-phase trials to see how
 it works. We’re open to 
learn.'

Zeo has given 
the US athletes a sleep tracking device. Chief executive Ben Rubin said: 'Olympic athletes are on the leading 
edge of performance. You can expect perfect compliance, which leads to 
perfect data.

'We seek to understand their 
sleep first, then trickle those findings down to everyday athletes and 
ordinary folks.'

The athletes are also using genetic reports from Pathway Genomics, which indicate nutritional needs and muscular capacity.
