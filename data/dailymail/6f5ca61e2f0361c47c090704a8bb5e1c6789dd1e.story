Their statuesque legs and elegant necks make giraffes the world's tallest creatures.

Handy when reaching to browse the leaves and buds on the highest treetops, the animal's long limbs can prove a hindrance when engaging in a battle with a rival beast.

Ferocious bull giraffes are often spotted on the African plains, battling it out in a display of dominance to claim mating rights.

As they faced up, one of the impressive animals lashed out, whacking his opponent with his powerful limb.

In a bid to dodge the impact the other ducked, stumbling before swinging around and getting in a twist.

Giraffes are capable of generating a huge amount of force and are able to knock an opponent to the ground with a single strike.

But in this instance the clumsy pair ended up entwined with one another.

Despite looking like a savage dual, contests such as these don't usually prove dangerous and end when one animal gives in and walks away.
