The ISHD said it wants 'lone wolf' attackers to go after the military members and 'kill them wherever you find them'.

The list did appear to match up with information which was available online, TheBlaze reported. 

The posting read: 'With the huge amount of data we have from various different servers and databases, we have decided to leak 100 addresses so that our brothers in America can deal with you.

'And now we have made it easy for you by giving you addresses, all you need to do is take the final step, so what are you waiting for?

'Kill them in their own lands, behead them in their own homes, stab them to death as they walk their streets thinking that they are safe.' 

A Defense official said most of the information on the list could be found in public records and on social media

The Defense Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are looking into the matter, the New York Times reported. 

An official told the paper most of the information on the list could be found in public records, residential address search sites and on social media.

Many of the personnel on the list were mentioned in news articles about air strikes on ISIS. 

A defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said: 'I can't confirm the validity of the information, but we are looking into it.

'We always encourage our personnel to exercise appropriate OPSEC [operations security] and force protection procedures.'
