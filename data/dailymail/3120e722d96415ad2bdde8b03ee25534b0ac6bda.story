For most people, caravans and motorhomes may feel like a rather outdated mode of transport.

But there is nothing old fashioned out this model. In fact, with an eye-watering price tag of £500,000, it costs more than most homes.

And what’s more, the Caravisio caravan also comes with the kind of mod-cons that wouldn’t look out of place in a luxury yacht.

On the road: The luxury caravan comes with an incredible £500,000 price tag

A spokesman for designers Knaus Tabbert described the futuristic vehicle as 'the future of caravanning'

The caravan, which is 9m (29.5ft) long and 2.5m (8.2ft) wide, is controlled through a hi-tech app, which regulates lighting, sound and heating.

It was officially unveiled for the first time on Monday at the UK's national Motorhome and Caravan Show at Birmingham's NEC.

The app, which uses finger print-activated biometric technology for security, was created by the German company Knaus Tabbert who spent £88,000 designing it.

In good weather the back of the caravan opens up to form an outdoor terrace while inside, the rear wall can be turned into a giant cinema screen.

At a cost of £500,000, the Caravisio caravan will cost more than most homes. It could go on sale in two years

In good weather, the back of the caravan can be opened up to form an outdoor terrace with seating area

There is even a specialised wine cooler compartment on board, as well as a frosted ‘smart glass’ dual-paned sliding door.

The cone-shape of the caravan make it more aerodynamic and is roomy enough for two single beds which can be turned into a King-size double.

The water system is controlled using a touch-screen display in the bathroom, which is located next to the front cockpit.

The prototype caravan, which took two years to develop, has a fibreglass shell, and could go one sale within two years.

Alex Wehrmann, spokesman for Knaus, said: ‘The Caravisio is an exciting new concept caravan that demonstrates what the future of caravanning really could look like.

‘Styled on a luxury yacht and designed to offer the ultimate in comfort and functionally, the back fully opens up with a verandah and awning to bring the outdoors inside.

‘A smart glass screen enables the TV to be projected outside, bringing a whole new element to caravanning.

‘It's not for sale, but if someone was to offer us £500,000 maybe we'd be able to develop another.’

Also being displayed at the national show is the world's first electric campervan.

The frosted glass screen can be turned into a cinema-style screen with films projected onto it

The Caravisio caravan features a frosted ‘smart glass’ dual-paned sliding door, which can become see-through

The 'smart glass' technology can switch between being frosted or see-through at the touch of a button and doubles up as a cinema screen

The Nissan e-NV200 has a top speed of 76mph, a range of 106 miles, and its battery can be recharged to 80 per cent capacity in half an hour.

The show features more than 400 exhibitors and was opened by former F1 world champion Nigel Mansell who has been a keen caravan enthusiast for more than 50 years.

The caravan and motorhome industry is responsible for generating £6billion each year for the UK economy.

In Britain, there are currently 550,000 touring caravans, 350,000 static-caravan holiday homes and 205,000 motorhomes.
