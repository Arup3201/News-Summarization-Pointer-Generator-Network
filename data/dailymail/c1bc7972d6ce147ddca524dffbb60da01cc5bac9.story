Pop-up testing centres have made major progress toward reaching the target of eliminating HIV in NSW by 2020.

The results come through in 30 minutes at the centres where you can walk-in or book while other clinics have doubled of the amount of testing in the past 18 months.

The data shows a pop-up clinic at Mardi Gras this year tested a higher proportion of men with high-risk sexual behaviours and found HIV in two per cent - double the average rate.

NSW is on the right track towards eradicating HIV with pop-up centres such as this clinic on Oxford St in Darlinghurst in March

Professor Andrew Grulich, from the University of NSW’s Kirby Institute for Infection and Immunity in Society, praised these results as impressive.

‘There are are big clinics in inner Sydney which have doubled their testing rates with some who were testing more than 1,000 a quarter, which has jumped up to 2,000,’ he said. ‘I think it's a tribute to how these centres have re-organised themselves internally to be able to do big volume testing, which is making a difference.'

The highest proportion of gay men in nearly 20 years are now getting tested for HIV,  with many attending the pop-up centre on Oxford St during Mardi Gras

The figures show the proportion of people diagnosed with low CD4 cell counts is decreasing, meaning fewer people have the virus for long periods of time before it is detected.

NSW chief medical officer Dr Kerry Chant said she was confident the 2020 target would be met, but more needed to be done.
