A suspicious shipment containing 18 severed human heads was discovered at a U.S. airport yesterday.

Customs agents found the human heads, still covered in skin, at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, but have declined to further discuss their condition.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection are currently investigating whether the foreign shipment are legitimate medical specimens.

Customs agents made a grisly discovery of 18 human heads Monday at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport

Meanwhile, the human body parts were sent to he Cook County Medical Examiner’s office for inspection.

The Department of Homeland Security confirmed that the heads were shipped from outside U.S. borders but declined to specify exact location, nor indicate where or to whom they were destined.

The heads appear to be medical samples at first blush, Brian Bell, spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security told Chicago Herald Sun.

‘There’s no issue with the transportation of body parts for medical purposes, there’s nothing against the law that says you cannot ship them, provided you have the right documentation.

‘Everybody here is “Oh my gosh, you got a box of heads” and everybody thinks that it’s unheard of.

‘It is a potentially legitimate medical shipment. We’ve seen it at various ports in the nation.'

Mysterious: Officials said no foul play was suspected

Local authorities said no foul play was suspected in the shipment, but will be investigating the matter further.

The heads may have been ordered by Cook County Medical Examiner’s office but the office have yet to 
comment any further than a confirmation that the body parts have been 
received.

In 2010, a shipment of 60 human heads
and parts of heads, wrapped with duct tape and stuffed in plastic 
containers, was seized at an Arkansas airport.

Investigators said the heads appeared to be medical specimens.

Authorities believed the specimens were part underground market for human body parts.
