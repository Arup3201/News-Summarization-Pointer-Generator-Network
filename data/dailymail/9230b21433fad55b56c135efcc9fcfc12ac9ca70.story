Basketball superstar LeBron James has sent cupcakes to his neighbours to apologise for the ruckus caused by the announcement of his Ohio homecoming earlier this month.Â 

Cleveland Cavaliers fans and journalists arrived en masse to the NBA star's home in Akron to await his decision on whether he would come back to Ohio or stay with the Miami Heat. A commotion ensued, and police were called to direct traffic.
