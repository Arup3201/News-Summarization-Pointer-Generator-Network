It's a delicacy usually consumed in small portions. But Andy Murray is such a fan of sushi he is able to eat 50 portions in one sitting.

High in protein and carbohydrates, the fish-based diet  has helped the British number one build up an imposing 6ft 3in, 13½ stone frame.

Without the extra rations the Scot’s punishing schedule would see him lose around 8kg of muscle in a year.

More than a mouthful: Andy Murray seeks out sushi wherever he play and can put away an incredible 50 portions in a single sitting

He needs to eat within an hour of the end of a match and makes sure his team has tracked down a high-quality sushi restaurant wherever he plays.

At Wimbledon he has been known to put sushi in an ice cooler so he can have it brought to him at the end of a late game.

Murray puts away an astonishing 6,000 calories a day washed down with at least six litres of water

He also eats large quantities of red 
meat, pasta and rice spread over six meals in a day. Breakfast is a 
yoghurt and a peanut butter bagel with a protein shake.

The 6,000 calories a day are washed down with at least six litres of water. Alcohol, processed foods and sugar are avoided at all costs.

The energy-rich meals are burned off throughout the day during his tennis sessions, hot Bikram yoga, stretches and weight training.

Nino Severino, who has coached top British players, says: ‘Andy is such a physical player that every time he slams down his foot he is basically ripping his body to shreds.

He then needs to replenish the lost protein because that’s a big element of rebuilding.

Players like sushi because it tastes fresh and is not fried.

‘There’s something called a glycaemic window. The body needs the carbohydrates and protein to replenish the muscles and the liver with glycogen. The rice helps that process.’

The Australian Institute of Sport has recommended sushi for all its athletes in the past and tennis ace Serena Williams and baseball star Alex Rodriguez are fans.

Scientists believe the benefits of sushi are one reason the Japanese are among the healthiest nations in the world.

The omega-3 fatty acids in fish are linked to heart protection and improved circulation and rice is a good source of protein.

Meanwhile, the seaweed wrapped around the rolls is rich in iodine. But despite its healthy reputation, the Japanese food came under attack recently from those who say it is worse than a McDonalds takeaway.

Critics say many sushi rolls contain very little fish and are laced with fatty mayonnaise – not to mention filled with processed carbohydrates.

Soy sauce, which often accompanies a sushi lunch, contains high salt levels – as does otherwise healthy miso soup.
