A retired accountant who was allegedly beaten to death at his £1million home by a prostitute had rowed with other escorts in the past, a court heard today. 

The body of Winston Fernandez, 69, lay undiscovered for almost a month after £600-a-night Russian prostitute Natalia Woolley, 38, allegedly kicked him to death.

Guildford Crown Court today heard how 
the widower had got into rows with other call girls in the past and had 
bank cards and other items stolen from him.

'Not doing the business': Retired Winston Fernandez, 69, who was allegedly beaten to death by Russian escort Natalia Woolley, 38, had complained to his handyman about the behaviour of his prostitutes the day he died

Mr Fernandez, who allegedly kept 
records of the girls and their chest sizes, complained to his handyman 
that he was annoyed at the prostitutes 'not doing the business' just hours before he died.

Jurors previously heard the Mr Fernandez and escort Woolley got into a fight 
during an appointment at Mr Fernandez’s house in Epsom, Surrey, after 
she arrived at 7.30pm on January 16 this year.

The Russian-born escort claims he had locked her in and she hit and kicked him in 
self-defence in her bid to escape.

Jurors heard how the 
69-year-old had become a regular client of escort agencies towards the 
end of his life and had been prescribed Viagra.

He suffered from numerous medical 
conditions, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, skin 
ailments, a fungal infection and cramp. He also had weak limbs and 
shuffled when he walked.

He also suffered from depression and 
possibly bipolar disorder but his main problem was an addiction to 
alcohol which saw him drink large amounts of beer and wine.

Even seven years before he died, the retired accountant was drinking three litres of wine a day.

Mr Fernandez sought companionship with
the female escorts after his wife passed away in 2000 and he became 
estranged from his sons.

Mr Fernandez spoke about the 
prostitutes to handyman Alan Horsman when he visited his house, in 
Ewell, Surrey, on January 16 - the day prosecutors believed he died.

Mr Horsman later informed police: 'He 
told me he had three call girls come round. He said two of them had not 
done the business and they had taken his money and went.

'One did do the business. He seemed annoyed about it.'

Emma Johnson, who saw Mr Fernandez a 
number of times and early on January 16 during her four months as an 
escort, described him as 'a nice, lonely man'.

Ms Johnson, who used the name Emily Jane while working for Diamond Escorts, said he had told her about a girl called Ruby.

She said: 'He said she had gone 
downstairs to the guest toilet and she had been gone for quite a while 
and he called out and eventually went downstairs and she had stolen a 
briefcase with some bank cards in it and this had been reported to 
Surrey Police.

'He was quite open about the fact that
he would see other escorts and he would actually write down on pieces 
of paper their names and their chest size and almost compare what he had
purchased.'

'Sexy and curvaceous': The call girl - who plied her trade under the aliases Lenka and Alice - is alleged to have broken 17 of the old man's ribs and fractured the bones in his windpipe in the brutal assault before cutting his phone lines as she left

Ms Johnson went to see Mr Fernandez in the early hours of January 16, spending two hours with him.

She and her driver took him to a supermarket to buy whisky and to go to a cashpoint before they returned to his house.

She said: 'He was quite slow. He 
needed help. It wasn’t because he was drunk. I think he would have 
needed that much help even if he wasn’t.

'I always thought to myself he wasn’t that healthy.'

She admitted he could be controlling 
by noting down how long a girl had been with him and would insist on 
being the person to contact their agency when the girl arrived.

Under cross examination by David 
Lederman QC, for the defence, she admitted that he was deteriorating 
during the brief time she knew him.

She said he had seemed stressed 
because of a pending court case connected to his drunkenness but that 
when she left he was asleep and 'looked quite content'.

She added: 'I know he could be tricky. I just blame that on alcohol, but I never had any problems with him personally.'

Suzanna Fariday, the operations 
manager for Diamond Escorts, would dispatch girls to clients and spoke 
to Winston Fernandez on numerous occasions.

She said: 'He became a regular client.
He started using us around November, then from December he started 
booking a lot of girls from our agency.'

She confirmed that after seeing Emily 
Jane between 4.15 and 6.15am on January 16, Mr Fernandez had then called
at 7pm to book another girl, Nicole.

However, he called again an hour later to cancel the booking.

She remembered her conversations with 
him, telling the court: 'To me he sounded like a very lonely old man who
has been drinking quite a bit.

'He was really nice. He liked to share his story about his family with us.

'He was a nice man. He was not horrible to us. We sent lots of girls. We didn’t have problems.'

Jurors have heard how Mr Fernandez had
suffered multiple injuries, including bruises from his head to his 
legs, with 17 broken ribs and two fractures to bones in his neck.

Prosecutors allege they were caused by kicking and stamping and cannot be explained by the account Woolley gave to police.

The trial, before Judge Christopher Critchlow at Guildford Crown Court, continues.

Woolley, from West Kensington, London, denies a single count of murder.
