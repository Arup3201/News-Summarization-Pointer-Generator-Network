Thomas Menino, the former mayor of Boston who shepherded his city through its darkest hour after a terrorist attack at the Boston Marathon, has died of cancer at age 71.

Menino was the longest-serving mayor in the city's history. He led City Hall for consecutive terms in city hall and reshaped the Back Bay into a modern, gleaming metropolis during his tenure. 

His tenure began 1993 and ended in January. He was diagnosed with cancer shortly after leaving office and handing over the reigns to Marty Walsh.

Last week, he announced that he was suspending his book tour and halting cancer treatments so that he could spend more time with his family. 

Former Boston Mayor Thomas Menino has died of cancer. He was diagnosed shortly after leaving office in January - but it didn't stop him from attending the first Boston Marathon after the 2013 terrorist attacks

Leader: Menino was in the hospital recovering from surgery when the Boston Marathon bombs went off. He checked himself out against his doctor's orders so that he could be at the first press conference

He died peacefully in the company of his family from advanced cancer. 

On April 15, 2013, less than three weeks after he announced that he would not seek a sixth term as mayor, two homemade bombs exploded near the finish line of the Boston Marathon - the city's marquee event. 

Three people were killed and more than 260 injured. Many lost limbs and were horribly maimed by the crude explosives packed with ball bearings. 

Menino was in a hospital recovering from surgery from a broken leg when the bombings struck. He checked himself out against doctor's orders so that he could attend the first press conference. 

During the ensuing manhunt for the terrorists and havoc that briefly led to the entire city going into lockdown and public transit shutting down, Menino was a calming presence.

He hoisted himself out of his wheelchair during one public event after the bombings so that he could stand behind the podium and declare: 'We are one Boston. No adversity, no challenge, nothing can tear down the resilience in the heart of this city and its people.' 

Menino dramatically hoisted himself out of his wheelchair three days after the bombing so that he could stand at Cathedral Holy Cross and declare: 'We are one Boston. No adversity, no challenge, nothing can tear down the resilience in the heart of this city and its people'

Menino was City Council President and was appointed Acting Mayor when President Bill Clinton named his predecessor to an ambassadorship

Visionary: Menino told developers who brought him the initial design of 111 Huntington Avenue: 'Guys, flat roofs don’t make it.' He personally approved the crown that ultimately topped the building

President Barack Obama: 'Bold, big-hearted, and Boston strong, Tom was the embodiment of the city he loved and led for more than two decades. As Boston’s longest-serving mayor, Tom helped make his hometown the vibrant, welcoming, world-class place it is today. His legacy lives on in every neighborhood he helped revitalize, every school he helped turn around, and every community he helped make a safer, better place to live.' 

Secretary of State John Kerry: 'Others talked, Tommy worked. Crime fell, population rose, the skyline became world-class, schools got better, the financial, academic, and medical sectors thrived, and neighborhoods became more diverse. It was in those neighborhoods that Mayor Menino made his mark.His example for 20 years as Mayor taught us all a lot about people and politics, and his example the last year taught us even more about grace and grit.'

Boston Mayor Marty Walks: 'To any who had come to know him, it is no surprise that more than half of Boston had a direct interaction with Tom Menino. No man possessed a greater love for our City, and his dedicated life in service to Boston and her people and changed the face of the City.'

Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg: 'Tom Menino was a terrific mayor and a close partner for me. I got to know Tom well as we worked together to keep cities safe from gun violence. In 2006, we formed Mayors Against Illegal Guns -- and what began as a meeting of 15 mayors ultimately became a coalition of more than 1,000 mayors from around the country.'

US Senator Elizabeth Warren: 'The City of Boston lost a great fighter today. Mayor Tom Menino used his big heart, his strong voice, and his fierce determination to shape every corner of the city. Bruce and I send our prayers to Mayor Menino’s wife Angela, to his family, and to all Bostonians. Our mayor is gone, but he lives on in every neighborhood in Boston.' 

A liberal Democrat in a liberal Democratic city, Menino helped found Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which has stepped up its gun control campaign in the wake of the school massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. 

However, he also worked to appeal to conservative voters in East Boston and won each re-election by landslide margins of at least 15 points. 

He was City Counsel President in 1993 when President Bill Clinton named Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn as US Ambassador the Vatican. Menino was named acting mayor by default. 

The Boston Globe reports that a community newspaper at the time declared him 'Action Mayor Tom Menino' and Mineno liked the the misspelling so much that he vowed to live up to it. 

He won the 1993 election by a landslide, becoming the city's first Italian-American to run City Hall.

In his tenure as mayor, he oversaw a remarkable transformation in Boston. He used the city's wealth of elite universities to help recruit high-tech and financial firms that brought high-paying jobs. 

He oversaw the construction of gleaming skyscrapers that transformed the skyline of Boston's Back Bay. 

When the developers proposed a 36-story tower next to the Prudential Tower, he vetoed the initial design and told them: 'Guys, flat roofs don’t make it.'

He then personally approved the illuminated crown design that makes 111 Huntington one of the most recognizable towers in the city.

Menino was known for his folksy down-to-earth style. He often got tongue-tied while making speeches and was known as 'Mumbles Menino' for his gaffs. 

But even as he worked to redevelop and redefine Boston, he prided himself on being a man of the people. 

The Globe reports that fully half of Bostonians said in a recent poll that they had personally met Menino - a remarkable feat in a city of nearly 650,000 people.

He was known for showing up and strolling through some of the city's toughest and far-flung neighborhoods. 

He attended hundreds, perhaps thousands, of ribbon cutting ceremonies - from burrito shops to community centers to mulltimillion-dollar skyscrapers.
