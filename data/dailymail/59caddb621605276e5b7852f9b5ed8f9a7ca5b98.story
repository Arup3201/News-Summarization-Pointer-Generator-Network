An elderly man is lucky to be alive after foolishly attempting to drive his low slung $75,000 Corvette through extremely dangerous floodwaters in Arizona.

The incident happened on Sunday morning after a storm rolled through the Phoenix area bringing half an inch of rain and heavy runoff from nearby mountains filled the usually dry wash.

While most drivers turned around when the saw the approaching waters, the unidentified man attempted to keep driving his sports car but ended up getting carried downstream.

The man and his prized 2013 limited 60th anniversary edition Corvette were washed nearly a mile down a flooded wash before they got stuck.

Witnesses describe seeing the car - almost totally submerged - floating under a bridge before traveling another 40 yards and stopping by a tree.

‘He stood on that tree until the water subsided enough where they could walk him out,’ local resident Marissa Creager told Fox 10.

A spokesperson for rescuers Phoenix Fire Station 8 said the man was fortunate to have escaped with his life.

The sports car was carried about a mile down a flooded wash before stopping by some trees where it continues to sit

'He's very lucky his car stayed upright, he's very lucky his car hung up on a tree, because the circumstances could have been very different for him,' says Phoenix Fire Capt. Jeff Schripsema.

Authorities said they rescued several motorists who became trapped in their vehicles on Sunday as they tried to drive through the floodwaters. No injuries were reported.

An unknown number of homes in an area of western Scottsdale were inundated, officials said.

The downpour prompted the shutdown of 
U.S. 60 in Tempe. State Route 88 northeast of Apache Junction and state 
Route 238 west of the Pinal County community of Maricopa were also 
closed.

On Saturday, southeast Tucson experienced flash flooding from a storm that brought about three-fourths of an inch of rain.

The storm led to several downed electric power lines in Tucson and two water rescue efforts.

A woman in her 40s who was under a Tucson bridge was swept away into a wash by floodwaters. The woman was able to get out of the water on her own and was then taken to a hospital.

In a separate incident, three children 
who were playing in a wash that wasn't running became trapped on a sand 
island by a rush of flood waters. The children, ages 8, 10 and 12, were 
rescued.
