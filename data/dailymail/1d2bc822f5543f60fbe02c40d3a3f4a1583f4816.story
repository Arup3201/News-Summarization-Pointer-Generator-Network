Rising obesity levels are forcing health bosses to spend millions of pounds adapting hospitals and buying specialist equipment to handle larger patients

Rising obesity levels are forcing health bosses to spend millions of pounds adapting hospitals and buying specialist equipment to handle larger patients.

Money is being been spent on reinforced beds, wider corridors and even larger morgue fridges as a result of the obesity epidemic. 

Hospitals spent an estimated £5.5million over the past three years, according to the Daily Telegraph which used Freedom of Information information from two thirds of NHS trusts.

The figure will prompt concern about the cost of dealing with the UK’s obesity epidemic, with campaigners describing the increasing financial burden on the health service as ‘unsustainable’.

Around a quarter of adults in the UK are classed as obese – the second highest rate in Europe - and a further 40 per cent are overweight.

But the financial burden on the NHS is likely to deepen in the future as obesity rates continue to soar.

Information provided by hospital trusts across England and Wales revealed that bosses have ordered corridors to be widened and operating theatre doors reinforced to cope with heavier patients.

Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King’s Lynn forked out £30,000 on a storage fridge for the dead bodies of obese patients.

At Yeovil District Hospital NHS Trust, a bariatric body cooling system that cools the bodies of obese patients who cannot fit in mortuary fridges was purchased for £15,000.

Overall, the figures reveal the NHS spent £2million on bariatric equipment and adjustments in the last year, while around £1.68 million was spent the previous year.

The NHS already spends an estimated £5.1billion a year treating obesity-related illnesses.

Attempts to deal with the problem have led to unusual clinical decisions, with the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence recently advising doctors to refer obese patients to Weigh Watchers classes.

The National Obesity Forum’s Tam Fry said that costs are likely to continue rising.

He told the newspaper: ‘We are not seeing the end of the obesity problem and people are getting fatter.

‘It has got to such a point that so much now has to be widened and strengthened. That runs to beds, hoists, wheelchairs and operating tables. And it also includes ambulances, morgues and crematoriums.’

Mr Fry added: ‘I think these costs will continue to increase. The problem is what we saw as “big” 20 years ago is now normal.’

Dr Aseem Malhotra, a director of Action on Sugar, said: ‘Inaction is not an option. I think diets should be made part of health policy.‘We need to tackle the root cause, the food environment - otherwise we will be crippled by the cost.’

A spokesman for NHS England said that it did not comment on the spending choices of individual trusts and clinical commissioning groups.
