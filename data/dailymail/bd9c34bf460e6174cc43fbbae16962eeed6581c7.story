Britons fighting for the so-called Islamic State insurgency in Iraq and Syria have called on fanatics in the UK to launch a campaign of assassination against key figures, it was claimed today.

Messages posted on the micro-blogging site Twitter are said to be offering addresses of VIP targets in the UK to potential jihadists still living in this country.

It comes as a law student accused of targeting former Labour prime minister Tony Blair faces a retrial after a jury was discharged in Britain's first secret terror trial.

VIP hitlist: Junaid Hussein, 20, from Birmingham, who was jailed in 2012 for hacking Tony Blair's office computer and has since become a prominent Islamic State tweeter, is said to be one of those urging attacks

The Sun claims an investigation has revealed Britons in Syria have a hitlist of prominent 'non-believers' whose names and addresses are on offer to extremists.

Junaid Hussein, 20, from Birmingham, is said to be one of those urging attacks. He was previously jailed for six months in 2012 for hacking Blair's office computer, then publishing the former PM's adress and National Insurance number on the Internet.

Now he is thought to be among a group of Britons dubbed The Beatles believed to be responsible for beheading five Westerners in propaganda videos.

The Sun claims Hussein, who goes by the nom de guerre Abu Hussain Al Britani, reposted a message from another Briton, known as Abu Dujana, last Friday calling for people to 'do something' to prominent non-believers.

The message, which MailOnline was unable to independently verify, was said to read: 'Whoo wants 2 do something 2 some top kaffirss, we gt addresses 4 u.'

Extremist: Hussein is said to be in the  group of Britons known as The Beatles, including the so-called Jihadi John, left, who have executed five Western hostages. In a separate case, a jury was this week discharged  in the secret trial of a man accused of planning to murder Tony Blair, right

It comes as police blunders enabled one of hate preacher Anjem Choudary’s top henchmen to skip bail and flee to Syria with his family.

Siddhartha Dhar, 31, disappeared less than 24 hours after being freed on police bail by Scotland Yard detectives investigating Choudary’s inner circle.

Dhar, a darling of TV interviewers repeatedly given a platform on the BBC to promote his radical views, had publicly stated that he wanted to live under the Islamic State.

In a separate case, this week a jury was discharged in the secret trial of suspected Islamic extremist Erol Incedal, 26, who is accused of planning to murder Blair. 

Incedal denied charges of preparing an act of terrorism, believed to be a bomb attack or machinegun rampage. He faces a retrial.
