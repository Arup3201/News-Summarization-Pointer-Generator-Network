The Japanese Grand Prix  top 10 in Suzuka as shown by our live leaderboard

It was one of Lewis Hamilton’s stellar drives, the kind that lifts people off their seats to marvel at what sport at its best is all about.

He was brave and relentless and skilled in a rain-splattered Japanese Grand Prix, seizing one of the finer of his 30 race victories by hunting down and passing his championship rival Nico Rosberg.

But within minutes of the win, his face was sombre, his words grave, as he waited in the ante-room ahead of the podium ceremony. Rosberg had just whispered in his team-mate’s ear the news that Jules Bianchi of Marussia had been seriously injured. 

Although the seriousness of Bianchi’s condition was not entirely known, the podium men — Hamilton, runner-up Rosberg and third-placed Sebastian Vettel of Red Bull — refrained from spraying the champagne.

In the fading light of a drab, sodden day, even Hamilton’s pyrotechnical driving had found sombre context.

The whole benighted weekend had been beset by talk of the incoming weather — a super-typhoon called Phanfone. Would it tip an oceanful of water over the track at 3pm local time, the scheduled start of the race?

The rain was incessant but only pitter-pattering down all day. As the cars were driven from the garage to the grid only Sergio Perez slipped off the track; the rest got round easily enough.

As they waited to start, the rain markedly intensified. The teams prepared their cars under gazebos, turning the grid into a tented village. Puddles glistened even in the gloom. Rivulets ran across the track. Fans in ponchos were soaked to the marrow.

1. Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) - 266

2. Nico Rosberg (Mercedes) - 256

3. Daniel Ricciardo (Red Bull) - 196

4. Sebastian Vettel (Red Bull) - 136

5. Fernando Alonso (Ferrari) - 133 

So the race started behind the safety car. It was a reasonable decision but even at this stately pace, Marcus Ericsson’s Caterham slid off. Hamilton came on to the radio to ask the team to tell Rosberg not to stop suddenly, so poor was the visibility.

Perhaps rather cautiously, race director Charlie Whiting called for a red flag after only two laps. There was a 20-minute delay during which the Ferris wheel next to the track was the only wheel that turned. The race finally restarted, again behind the safety car.

Hamilton was not keen on this artificial brake racing. In increasingly exasperated tones, he made it clear he thought conditions sufficiently good to take the safety car away.

‘Charlie, the track is fine,’ he said, addressing Whiting directly. Hamilton’s almost self-destructive blindness to danger is one of his finest traits as a sportsman.

Not everybody agreed with his gung-ho promptings. Felipe Massa of Williams complained animatedly that the conditions were unsafe. Whiting waited a little longer before withdrawing the safety car.

Now Hamilton was a dog off his lead. Ahead of him was Rosberg, who took pole position brilliantly in the dry on Saturday but was now being harried every lap by the other Mercedes.

So it was no surprise when Hamilton passed him by coming out of the final chicane on lap 29 more cleanly, closing on his quarry on the straight and going round him on the outside of the first corner. It was clean, hard racing. There was no reprise of the Senna-Prost chicanery.

‘I was pushing to get by Nico,’ said Hamilton. ‘I had the DRS (overtaking device) open and I forgot to take it off. When I went into the corner the rear end stepped out. It was very, very close but I saved it.’

Once he was ahead, he simply blitzed away to open up a 10-point gap at the top of the world championship standings with four races remaining.

He takes the momentum of three victories on the bounce into next Sunday’s inaugural Russian Grand Prix, although the absurdity of double scoring at the final race in Abu Dhabi renders his advantage less significant than it should be.

The race was brought to a premature end when Bianchi slid off as he exited Dunlop, the long left-hander seventh corner, and hit the crane that was trying to lift Adrian Sutil’s Sauber off the track. A safety car was deployed before the rising concern over his condition — and possibly the worsening light — caused the race to be brought to an end six laps early. The conditions were bad, but the typhoon stayed away.

An honourable mention should go to Jenson Button, the supreme tactician, who was first in for intermediate tyres after the restart and finished an impressive fifth for McLaren.

It was a timely reminder of the Briton’s ageless skills, with Fernando Alonso linked with his seat if, as expected, the Spaniard leaves Ferrari to be replaced by Vettel, who announced this weekend that he is moving from Red Bull.

However, Alonso, it seems, may instead opt for a year out of the sport. His race ended after three laps with a suspected electrical failure. He was taken back to the garage on a scooter and threw his hands up in a resigned shrug.
