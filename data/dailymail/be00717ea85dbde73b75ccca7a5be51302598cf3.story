A £14,000-a-year prep school attended by Prince Charles could be closed after it was found to be unsafe, and children were lagging behind in their mathematics and writing skills.

Hill House Independent Junior School in Kensington in west London was rated 'inadequate' in every single category by Ofsted inspectors and its fate will now be decided by ministers who will review the report.

An inspection of the exclusive  school, where alumni include Prince Charles and singer Lily Allen, criticised it for breaching health and safety measures as well as failing to ensure its young students make adequate progress.

Hill House was also criticised for focusing on getting older pupils to practice entry tests for secondary schools at the expense of teaching them in depth about their subjects.

The family run school, which is based at several houses in Kensington and Chelsea, has previously been described as 'eccentric' in the Good Schools Guide. It has almost 1,000 pupils who attend from the age of four to 11.

The Department for Education said the next stage in the process is for ministers to review the report. 

A spokesman said 'all options' remained open, despite the school's independent status. This includes closure or helping leaders come up with an action plan to improve.

Among the criticisms leveled at the school by inspectors, who visited at the beginning of December last year, was the poor educational attainment by pupils. 

The report said: 'Too few pupils make adequate progress across the school, particularly in writing and mathematics.

'Leaders and proprietors do not have the capacity to secure essential improvements. They are not taking any action to secure effective teaching. They do not know if pupils are making the progress of which they are capable.' 

Behaviour and safety of pupils also achieved a blistering 'inadequate' rating by inspectors. 

While pupils were regarded as polite with 'excellent manners' and generally good behaviour, their safety was raised as a concern. 

Inspectors highlighted poor attention paid to health and safety. It said 'The safety of pupils and adults is compromised on some of the school sites. 

The report branded fire evacuation procedures 'flawed', with records lacking detail and staff lacking training to deal with problems.

It said the supervision of children was sometimes 'lax' and some fire exits could be a hazard. 

Ofsted inspectors rated the school as 'inadequate' in each of the five categories of leadership and management; behaviour and safety of pupils; quality of teaching; achievement of pupils; early years provision.

The prep school was ranked as inadequate in all five areas that were inspected by Ofsted in December 

A spokesman from the Department for Education said: 'We have just received a copy of Ofsted's published report following an inspection at Hill House International Junior School.  

'Ministers are studying that report and will confirm their decisions about regulatory action shortly. 

'It would be wrong to take any decisions until we have studied the findings, but all options remain open - including closure.

'We have repeatedly demonstrated for all types of school that we will not hesitate to take tough action if required.'

The school was founded in 1956 by the late Lieutenant Colonel Stuart Townend, and has been run by his son Richard for the last 13 years, supported by his wife. 

Hill House International Junior School was founded in London in 1951 by the late Lieutenant Colonel Stuart Townend.

It is now run out of several houses in Kensington and Chelsea, and has a site in Switzerland. 

Five years later in 1956 Prince Charles went to the school - the first time an heir to the throne had attended a school outside the Royal household.

The Queen, Prince Philip and Princess Anne visited the school for sports day in 1957. 

After his time at Hill House, Prince Charles was enrolled at Cheam Preparatory School in Berkshire and later was moved to Gordonstoun in Scotland.

Girls were first accepted into Hill House in 1981 and Lily Allen is a former pupil. 

The school offers trips to Switzerland as well as the chance to practice sport at the Duke of York’s Barracks in Chelsea.

Pupils have gone on to win scholarships at a number of exclusive schools including Cheltenham Ladies' College, Eton and Harrow. 

Scholarships have also been awarded to pupils to study overseas including at St Mary’s Waverley in Johannesberg and New Canaan Country School, Connecticut. 

Hill House was founded in London in 1951 

While it offers trips to Switzerland and sports practice at the Duke of York’s Barracks in Chelsea, as well as compulsory swimming lessons, inspectors were less than encouraged by the way teachers ensure pupils make progress.

The report said: 'Teachers do not routinely assess pupils’ progress in lessons. They do not ask searching questions to probe pupils’ understanding in order to adjust the activity and secure pupils’ better engagement and progress.

It added: 'Older pupils do not learn in depth across a range of subjects. They spent much of their time practising test papers to secure a place in the school of their choice.'

On its website the school lists a number of scholarships won by its pupils at exclusive schools including Cheltenham Ladies College, Harrow and Eton College.  

Inspectors also said that because the school measures pupils against its own system of attainment it is not possible to compare this with national achievement of children.  

Richard Townend, who now runs the school, has attacked the inspectors' findings, insisting that pupils attending the school are kept safe.

In a letter to parents, he said : 'As I go around the school, I see happy children enjoying being at school, working hard and making great progress in a safe environment.'

He added: 'We provide opportunities in art, music, drama and sport which others envy.

'Each Wednesday, the assembly astonishes visitors with its display of talent in our school and the feeling of corporate warmth, friendliness and support of the whole Hill House family - pupils, parents and tutors. These are things of the greatest value.'

Mr Townend added: 'The school will explore in detail every criticism they have made and correct anything which needs attention'.

The school has already asked the firm Capita to report on the school's health and safety standards and is holding a security audit.

It was last inspected in December 2012, when it was rated 'good.' 

An emergency inspection last May, carried out at the request of the Department for Education, found the quality of education was effective but the school was failing to meet safety requirements, the Evening Standard reported.
