Oscar Pistorius’s former girlfriend has revealed her fears that he would kill her, and spoken of his 'angry and possessive rages'.

Samantha Taylor, who dated the paralympian for 18-months, claims he made her sit on a naughty step as he shouted at her, and once drove his Porsche at 200mph as a 'punishment' for an argument.

The 20-year-old student said she was once so scared that he would shoot her, she hid his gun. It was to be the same weapon he later used in the fatal shooting of his model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.

Pistorius, 27, was cleared of the murder of Miss Steenkamp yesterday, but today faces jail for shooting her dead.

Oscar Pistorius flies the flag for South Africa at the 2012 Olympic Games in London. At the time he was in a stormy relationship with Samantha Taylor, 20, who has now spoken of his 'angry and possessive rages'.

Before
 he got together with Miss Steenkamp, Pistorius had spent a 
year-and-a-half dating Cape Town marketing student Miss Taylor.

She told the Mirror she feared he would kill her and even once hid his gun. She said she was also left with 
bruises and scars after she alleges he bit and pinched her.

But Miss Taylor said it was not only physical violence that she suffered at the Blade Runner's hands - she claimed she was also tortured mentally by him.

She said: 'Oscar used to lock me in his house and then go out. I had no food, I couldn’t get out. It was dangerous.' She alleges that he would often stay out all night after locking her in.

'There for two tragedies but not the third': Reeva's parents June and Barry Steenkamp (above) said they nearly lost their daughter twice - once after nearly bleeding to death from tonsil surgery and then in a riding accident

She said he left her terrified after he drove his Porsche at up to 200mph to 'punish' her.

One night, she claims, the athlete became so drunk that he set his floor on fire and danced around it. After slipping, she said he cut his lip and chipped his tooth - later convincing himself that she had hit him.

It was then, she said, she became convinced he would shoot her.

She told the paper: 'I had to hide his gun, I was so scared of him.

'But because he was so drunk he thought I’d beaten him up. He started screaming at me.'

While he was with Miss Taylor, Pistorius was linked with numerous other women, including Russian model Anastassia Khozissova.

When
 it became clear that Pistorius and Steenkamp were dating, Miss Taylor 
earlier said: 'Oscar has such a way with women. She’s probably not the only one 
he’s got.'

Miss Taylor went on to tell South Africa's City Press newspaper that 'Oscar is certainly not what people think he is.'

Pistorius will find out today if he is guilty of the manslaughter of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp during a Valentine's Day shooting at his home in Pretoria.

The double-amputee broke down in court yesterday as he was cleared of two murder charges, but judge Thokozile Masipa hinted the 27-year-old may be convicted of a lesser charge of culpable homicide after describing his actions as 'negligent' on the night she died.

The 27-year-old athlete broke down as judge Masipa said there was not enough evidence to support prosecution claims Pistorius intended to kill the law graduate-turned-model last year.

But the judge appeared to indicate he will be convicted of culpable homicide - the South African equivalent of the UK's manslaughter charge - when he returns to court today, describing Pistorius as being "negligent" in killing 29-year-old Ms Steenkamp.

She told the court in Pretoria, which included members of both the defendant's and the victim's families, that Pistorius acted 'hastily' with 'too much force' when he fired four bullets through his toilet door in the early hours of February 14 2013. Pistorius was also described by the judge as a 'very poor witness', who 'lost his composure' during cross-examination.

At the age of five, Reeva nearly bled to death after suffering complications when she had her tonsils taken out

The athlete, dubbed Blade Runner due to his prosthetic limbs, has always admitted he shot Ms Steenkamp, though he told police he simply mistook his girlfriend for intruders.

Delivering her verdict yesterday, judge Masipa criticised Pistorius' decision to reach for his 9mm pistol and fire it through the toilet cubicle in his home rather than raise the alarm or fire a warning shot.

She said: 'If the accused, for example, had awoken in the middle of the night and in darkness seen a silhouette by his bed and in a panic shot at that figure, only to find it was the deceased, his conduct would have been understandable and perhaps excusable.'

She added: 'The accused had reasonable time to think, reflect and conduct himself.

'I'm not persuaded that a reasonable person with the same disability would have fired the four shots.'The accused knew there was a person behind the toilet door, he chose to use a firearm.

'I am of the view the accused acted too hastily and used too much force. It is clear his conduct is negligent.'
