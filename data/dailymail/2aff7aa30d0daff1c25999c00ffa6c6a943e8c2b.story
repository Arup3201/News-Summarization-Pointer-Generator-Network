Guarding the Queen’s home is a serious and solemn duty.

So it’s a good thing Her Majesty was not around to see this soldier apparently pirouetting on the forecourt of Buckingham Palace.

In his red tunic and bearskin, the Grenadier Guard was filmed seemingly trying to ease the boredom of his two-hour shift with a series of remarkably elegant dance moves.

Now, how can I relieve the boredom? The soldier muses at his sentry box

His antics delighted tourists but the Army and Ministry of Defence were not amused. He could now face disciplinary action. 

The Queen was not in residence at the time as she is currently holidaying in Scotland.

But a spokesman for the Ministry of Defence confirmed to the Mail last night that they were aware of the film and have launched an internal investigation.

She said: ‘Anyone who is found to fall short of the Army’s high standards can expect to face appropriate action.’

Initial enquiries have suggested that the film is not a hoax.

The three-minute clip was posted online last month and appears to have been filmed recently as a notice advertising the annual Summer Opening of the palace’s State Rooms can be seen in the foreground.

How about a twirl@ Ridle on shoulder, he launched into a pirouette

It shows the solider, dressed in his red tunic and bearskin with its white Grenadier plume, attempting to alleviate the boredom of his two-hour guard shift with a series of silly stunts.

Marching up and down, he first bends down to pick up something from the gravel forecourt which he then puts in his pocket.

He then proceeds to walk very slowly – freezing at one point – before launching into a comical speed walk.

On his next turn he pretends to polish his guard box with his knuckles as walks past.

The antics do not end there, however, as the soldier walks with a hip-swinging strut before launching into his tour de force: a series of three, remarkably elegant, pirouettes - not once but twice.

A group of English tourists can clearly be heard laughing in the background, marvelling at the guardsman’s antics. One child says: ‘Look at him spinning. That’s really silly. Do you think he will get told off for it by the policeman?’

Strictly not allowed: Dancing on duty, the guard turns his back

He then retreats to his box but not before he gestures a thumbs-up to what appears to be his fellow guardsman on the other side of the portico, scratches his nose and leans theatrically to one side.

Although the footage is hugely amusing, a military source said senior officers would take a dim view of the soldier’s slapstick.

‘He is there to guard Buckingham Palace not provide horseplay for tourists,’ said one yesterday.

It is likely that he will be either confined to barracks or see his pay docked.

The Grenadier Guards – motto: Honi soit qui mal y pense, Shame Upon He Who Thinks Evil Of It – was formed in 1656 by the exiled King Charles II and are stationed at Wellington Barracks in London.

It is one of seven regiments that make up the Household Division, which has provided The Queen (or King’s) Guard since the 17th Century.

Four sentry guards are posted immediately outside the palace when the Queen is residence, which is reduced to two when she is at Windsor Castle or holidaying on one of the estates.

Well, that livened up the day: Back at the sentry box

A sentry will be on duty at their post for a two hour period. Every 10 minutes he comes to attention, slopes arms and does a march of 15 paces across the area of the post. Each sentry will do this four to five times before halting.

He will then shoulder his arms and stand ‘at ease’.

Orders for sentry duty read out before each two-hour ‘tour of duty’, make it clear that: ‘You may not eat, sleep, smoke, stand easy, sit or lie down during your tour of duty.’

Members of The Queen’s Guard not simply ceremonial soldiers, however. As well as providing sentries day and night, they also patrol the grounds of the Palace.

Like many of their fellow regiments, the Grenadier Guards are also professional infantry soldiers deployed on operations across the globe.

In a statement the Army told the Mail yesterday: ‘We are aware of the video. Anyone who is found to fall short of the Army’s high standards can expect to face appropriate action.’

A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ‘We have no comment to make. It is a matter for the Ministry of Defence and his regiment.’
