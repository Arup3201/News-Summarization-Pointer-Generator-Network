Human hair has been identified in fossilised hyena poo - a finding suggesting that our ancestors were eaten by the predatory animals.

The fossil was discovered a few years ago at Gladysvale cave in South Africa, but has only recently been analysed by scientists, who identified the hair.

African researchers believe the hyenas either actively hunted our ancestors living 257,000-years-ago or scavenged some dead bodies, ingesting hair.

Gladysvale Cave, is a fossil-bearing cave located about 13 km Northeast of the well known South African hominid-bearing sites of Sterkfontein and Swartkrans and about 45 km North-Northwest of the City of Johannesburg, South Africa. 

It is a complex cave system made up of several underground chambers reaching a depth of about 65 metres.

It is situated within the Cradle of Humankind World Heritage Site.

Many thousands of fossils have been recovered from the Gladysvale deposits including rare remains of hominids.

Almost a quarter of a million bones have been recovered from the external Gladysvale deposits since excavations began in 1992.

Fossils recovered include antelope, giant zebra, carnivores including extinct wolves, monkeys and hominids attributed to Australopithecus africanus and early Homo.

However, they have not ruled out that the animal just fancied a snack of human hair that it found somewhere, Discovery News reported.

The fossilised faeces was part of a 'hyena latrine' discovered in a cave located in the Sterkfontein Valley in South Africa, according to researchers at the University of Witwatersrand.

Gladysvale is a complex cave system made up of several underground chambers reaching a depth of about 65 metres.

Phillip Taru and Lucinda Backwell, authors of the research  published in the Journal of Archaeological Science, said brown hyenas roamed the savannah grasslands, like they do today.

Other hairs demonstrated that the animals shared their environment with warthogs, zebra, impala, and kudu, as well as hominins - a tribe of our ancestors.

The scientists focused on examining scale patterns and cross sections of hair to identify the fossilised hairs.

The researchers said: 'A lack of hair scales has been documented in human hair subject to pathology.

They even suggested that our ancestors had many a bad hair day, because of  'abrasion of the hair resulting from inhabiting rock crevices' that could have reduced the number of scales found on the hairs.

A total of 48 hairs were extracted from 
the 12 fossils using fine tweezers and were examined using a scanning 
electron microscope.

They identified the origins of the hairs using standard guides as well as comparing them to a collection of samples from 15 indigenous southern African mammals.

The findings support previous tentative identifications of fossilised human hairs and give scientists a better picture of the local Middle Pleistocene mammal community as well as an insight into the  environment in which archaic and emerging modern humans in the interior of the African subcontinent lived.
