Barrie Whitehead was caught on CCTV stealing from greetings cards

A postal worker said he stole the 'odd fiver' from greeting cards because he was being bullied at work, a court has heard.

Barrie Whitehead helped himself in full view of CCTV cameras because he wanted to be caught and sacked from his job of 20 years.

Manchester Crown Court was told that the 53-year-old was subjected to 'childish' homophobic taunts after he and his wife were seen socialising with friends in the gay area of the city.

Depressed and 'isolated' from his workmates, he began looting small sums from mail at the depot where he worked around last Christmas.

Confronted with the incriminating footage, Whitehead told investigators his behaviour was 'a cry for help'.

He went on to admit stealing £62 in cash and £30 in gift vouchers and was given a 26-week sentence, suspended for a year, with 60 hours unpaid work.

Bernadette Baxter, prosecuting, told Manchester Crown Court that earlier this year staff at the Manchester Mail Centre, Oldham Road, Ancoats, became 'suspicious' of Whitehead's activities and launched a surveillance operation.

In the early hours of January 28 he was observed opening a greetings card and pocketing the contents.

Four dummy packages were put his way as a trap. He took the bait, and was seen opening three of them with a small blade. In the interviews that followed Whitehead made 'full and frank admissions', the court heard, saying he had been stealing for about a month.

Miss Baxter said: 'The defendant said he couldn't give any particular reason why he had stolen those items from the post, he wasn't in any particular financial difficulty.

'He did say he was suffering from depression, that he had been bullied at work and saw it himself as something of a cry for help.'

Alistair Reid, defending, said while the offence was in a 'special category' because of the 'trust' placed in Royal Mail staff, Whitehead had been a model employee for many years.

'This is somebody who has, in his early 50s, taken such an outrageous step in full view of CCTV, effectively knowing he would be caught and identified.

'On the face of it it's hard to accept that bullying of such a childish nature has led to this - the difficulty is that he is a very withdrawn and timid man, who simply does not have the capacity to stand up to these bullies or report it to his line manager.

'In the cold light of day that is what he should have done. Instead he's internalised these difficulties, become extremely withdrawn, to the point where he'd retreat to his car for isolation at lunchtime.

'He didn't inform his family until he was investigated and suspended,' Mr Reid added.

The court heard that Whitehead, of Heaton Street, Prestwich, had lost his job and now worked as a maintenance operative at McDonalds.

Sentencing, and ordering him to pay £200 prosecution costs, Judge Atherton said: 'It's the meanest sort of theft, not very much money, but people have trust they can put the odd £5 or £10 in greeting cards. There might be a child looking forward to some extra pocket money and (Whitehead) comes along and steals it - and calls it a cry for help.'
