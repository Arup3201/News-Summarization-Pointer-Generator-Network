The cartoonist behind the legendary French comic strip Asterix has come out of retirement to pay tribute to the victims of the Charlie Hebdo attack.

Albert Uderzo released two new drawings in solidarity with the cartoonists killed on Wednesday, which he shared on the official Asterix Twitter account.

One shows Asterix declare: 'Moi aussi je suis un Charlie' - which translates to 'I too am a Charlie'.

The other sketch shows main characters Asterix and Obelix bowing their heads in grief with their hats in their hands.

Asterix holds a rose in one hand, and their pet Dogmatix looks back over his shoulder with sadness.

The 87-year-old cartoonist told Le Figaro: 'Charlie [Hebdo] and Asterix have nothing to do with each other obviously.

'I simply want to express my affection for those designers who have paid with their lives.'

'Young designers are on hand now and I wish them courage. They keep in mind this terrible thing came to their colleagues that no one could expect.'

French media reported that 'At the age of 87, Uderzo takes his pen for #CharlieHebdo' on Twitter

He also expressed his anger at the attack, adding: 'How can you do such appalling actions? How can people who say humans can they kill people they do not know.'

Since the attack, cartoonists across the world have flooded the internet with powerful drawings in defiance of the armed gunmen who attempted to silence the satirical French newspaper Charlie Hebdo.

Using the hashtag #jesuischarlie, meaning I am Charlie in French, artists shared their own powerful and often satirical sketches to advocate for free press, denounce violence and mourn their innocent colleagues from the French publication.

Tonight, 'Paris est Charlie' (Paris is Charlie) was projected onto the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, in tribute to the victims.

Elsewhere, people paid their respects by holding banners reading 'Je suis Charlie' and observed a minute's silence in remembrance. 

In Cannes, a giant banner saying 'Je suis Charlie' was displayed over the Palais des Festivals facade and people were pictured holding signs with the same message outside.
