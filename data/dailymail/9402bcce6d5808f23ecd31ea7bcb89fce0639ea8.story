A convicted killer was tonight on the loose after he escaped from an open prison.

Alan Giles was in the open part of the multiple-category HMP Hewell in Redditch, Worcestershire, serving two life sentences for the murder and kidnap of 16-year-old student Kevin Ricketts in 1995.

The 56-year-old, who previously worked as a builder and is originally from Oldbury, West Midlands, absconded yesterday - and West Mercia Police officers are now desperately trying to track him down.

Giles was described as white, 5ft 9in height and of proportionate build, with short grey hair and blue eyes. He has a scar on the right of his forehead and another small one by his left eye.

He has tattoos of an eagle on his back and a swallow, shark and flower on his left arm. The murderer was described by police as an ‘expert digger’ at the time of the killing.

He became the ninth killer in Britain to be put behind bars despite no trace of a victim’s body. But in 1998, Giles phoned police from his cell to confess to the killing and where he had buried the body.

After spending hours excavating earth in the back garden of a house in Edgbaston, West Midlands, forensic anthropologists recovered a body 5ft below the surface, hidden by thick undergrowth.

Prison: HMP Hewell in Redditch, Worcestershire - which can hold 1,261 prisoners - was given a scathing report by the HM Inspectorate of Prisons in April, which said it was unacceptably dirty

Dental records and x-rays confirmed 
the body was of Mr Ricketts, but it was too decomposed to find a cause 
of death. At an inquest, a transcript was read out of the interview 
between Giles and police.

HMP Hewell - which is governed by 
Stephanie Roberts-Bibby and can hold 1,261 prisoners - was given a 
scathing report by the HM Inspectorate of Prisons in April, which said 
it was unacceptably dirty.

The
report, based on an inspection in November 2012, added that there were 
high levels of assaults, many inmates found it easy to get hold of drugs
and some staff seemed to lack motivation.

It
also said: ‘Some communal areas were filthy even after they had been 
“cleaned” by wing cleaners, and waste was thrown out of cells into the 
exercise yards below, which went unchallenged.’

The
prison said 'decisive action' had been taken, and the National Offender
Management Service said the management team had been strengthened.

It read: ‘I don’t know whether I grabbed 
him with one hand or two hands. You just lose it. I probably grabbed him
round the throat. A struggle broke out. I left him on the ground, where I showed you, in the garden.’

He went on to say that he had hit the student from Quinton, Birmingham, with a piece of wood, but it was not clear whether that had killed him.

Detective Inspector John Cashion of West Mercia Police said: ‘We have a dedicated investigation team working expeditiously to locate and apprehend Giles and to that end we are also liaising with our colleagues in West Midlands Police and in the Prison Service.

‘We have information that gives us concern for his welfare and it is important that we trace him as soon as possible. It should be borne in mind that Giles was in an open part of the prison when he went missing.  

‘However we would appeal to anyone who sees him not to approach him but to contact police immediately on 999. Furthermore, we would urge anyone who may be helping him or sheltering him to contact us without delay.’

A Ministry of Justice spokesman told MailOnline: ‘The level of absconding from open prisons in 2012/13 was the second lowest since records began.

Troubles: The HMIP report, based on an inspection in November 2012, added that there were high levels of assaults, many inmates found it easy to get hold of drugs and some staff seemed to lack motivation

‘Absconds are still 13 per cent lower 
under this Government. We are not complacent about this issue and are 
looking at ways in which the risk of absconding can be reduced further.

‘We
are committed to ensuring that risk to the public is minimised. All 
those located in open conditions have been rigorously risk assessed and 
categorised as being of low risk to the public.’

Giles was believed to have been wearing a grey jumper, blue jeans and white trainers. He has had recent contact with family in the West Midlands and most of his friends are in the same area.

HMP Hewell was created by an amalgamation of the three former prisons on this site, Blakenhurst, Brockhill and Hewell Grange, in June 2008. The prison formerly known as Brockhill has since closed.
