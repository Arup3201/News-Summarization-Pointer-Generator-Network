Earlier this week, a visibly pregnant Duchess of Cambridge wowed guests at a Kensington Palace charity event, with a stunning sheer polka dot top which she teamed with a neat belt and a shimmering knee-length skirt.

But although she looked a million dollars, her outfit came with the considerably lower price tag of £89 - the cost of the glamorous semi-sheer top by Hobbs chosen for the event.

And it isn't the first time that Kate has stepped out in High Street. Zara, where prices for dresses average out at £50, and Whistles, which offers T-shirts for £40 and dresses for £120, are among her favourites as are Topshop and Reiss.

High street meets high-end: The Duchess of Cambridge teamed an £89 Hobbs top with a Jenny Packham skirt at last night's Place2be charity event - just the latest example of how she uses simple styling tricks to make her low-cost labels look a million dollars

But while low-cost looks might have been bought for bargain prices, on the Duchess, they look anything but high street, thanks in no small part to her judicious use of accessories and penchant for teaming budget buys with designer splurges. 

Her appearance at the Place2be charity event was no exception. Joining the £89 Hobbs bargain was a billowing silk skirt by top designer Jenny Packham, a patent leather belt and, of course, her stunning sapphire and diamond engagement ring.

The Duchess' latest high street outing is the continuation of a trend that began the moment she joined the royal family in 2011 and chose a simple Zara dress for her going away outfit.

She teamed the £49.99 pleated blue number with a pair of £129.99 wedge pumps by another of her favourite high street brands, L.K. Bennett, while the fitted black jacket that completed the ensemble had been tailored just for her.

A month later, at Prince Philip's 90th birthday celebrations, the dress appeared again, this time with a designer Jane Troughton coat.

Diamonds are a girl's best friend: To open an art room in North London, she chose a £225 kingfisher blue dress by LK Bennett and added £1,200 amethyst and diamond drop earrings by her favourite jeweller Kiki McDonough (left) Blign bling: Kate looked radiant in another high street design from Whistles at the National Portrait Gallery, she paired the Sofia Rae dress with dazzling earrings once owned by Princess Diana (right)

Since then, she has stepped out in a whole host of high street numbers, whether the Petit Bateau striped top she wore to watch Prince William play polo earlier this year, or the tailored Zara jacket sported during the royal visit to New Zealand.

Again and again, the Duchess has mixed high fashion with high street style, although many of her purchases - among them the designer bargains she picks up at the Bicester Village outlet centre - are later tailored to ensure they fit perfectly.

But could there be more to the Duchess' high-low wardrobe than her love of a bargain? Fashion writer Simon Glazin thinks a desire to please a public fed up with watching high-spending politicians splash out could also be a factor.

'There has been lots written about the Duchess and Prince William's spending,' he explains. 'It's likely to be the reason why she is thrifty with her wardrobe and often recycles dresses and coats. Even a Princess has to dress on a budget.'

Deja-vu: Kate's cornflower blue Zara Dress that she wore the day after announcing her engagement to Prince William sold out and she proved to be the frugal Duchess when the dress appeared again just a month later at Prince Philip's 90th birthday celebrations. She updated it with a swanky Jane Troughton coat, right

Luxe it up: The Duchess of Cambridge visited the 1st Battalion Irish Guards at the St. Patricks Day Parade at Mons Barracks Aldershot in March wearing a  £279 Hobbs coat and £400 Emmy shoes and clutch, which was £290 by the same designer 

And it certainly seems to be working, with the Duchess named the UK's third most popular royal after Prince Harry and the Queen in a recent YouGov poll.

Her love of British brands has also won her acclaim from the UK's fashion industry with her relentless championing of labels like Alexander McQueen, Goat and Jenny Packham giving business a noticeable boost.

But while she's no stranger to designer fashion, the high street, whether her Topshop maternity dresses or L.K Bennett 'Sledge' shoes, remains a favourite. 

'We're lucky in the UK to have one of the best high streets in the world,' adds Glazin, 'and it's good to see a royal appreciate it too. Kate has obviously worked out that designer pieces plus high street buys adds up to super-stylish - and she looks better than ever for it.'

Mixing it up: For a trip to the Warner Brothers' Studio when she was pregnant with Prince George, right, she teamed a £38 Topshop dress with a more high-end Ralph Lauren blazer

Style icons collide: Kate met Michelle Obama  at Buckingham Palace in 2011 wearing a £175 Beige Shola shift dress from Reiss, £160 LK Bennett shoes and a pricier Anya
Hindmarch clutch bag, which cost £259

Clever styling: Kate looked a million dollars on the red carpet at the Princes Trust concert wearing a short figure-hugging black and tan dress costing just £69.99 from Zara, which she teamed with a Ralph Lauren blazer
