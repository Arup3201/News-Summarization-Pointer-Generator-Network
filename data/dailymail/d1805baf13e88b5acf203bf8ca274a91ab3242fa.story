Football legend Alfredo Di Stefano, 86, has announced plans to marry a woman 50 years his junior.

The Argentine said he will marry his Costa Rican personal assistant Gina Gonzalez, 36, this month and hopes Florentino Perez, president of his old club Real Madrid, will be best man.

Di Stefano, whose wife Sara died in 2005, admitted his six children might not be happy at the news but that he did not care what they thought. 

He added: ‘I’m in love. I’m 86 years old but I’ve got a young heart.’

The former footballer met Ms Gonzalez
when she helped him prepare his autobiography in 2007 and said he won 
her over with his 'sense of humour'.

She now works as his secretary, manager and representative.

The wedding is expected to take place in less than a month’s time.

Di Stefano added: 'I am interested in my life and nothing else. And not making a lot of trouble.

'They
are going to have a go at me but I will take it with sincerity. If any 
wants to ask me then let them do it and I will explain it to them.'

European player of the year in 1957 
and 1959, Di Stefano helped guide Real to five successive European Cups 
from 1956 to 1960 – scoring in each final.

He scored a hat trick when Real Madrid side won the 1960 European Cup Final
in Glasgow 7-3, widely regarded as one of the best ever matches.

In recent years he has had health problems and often appears in public in a wheelchair.
