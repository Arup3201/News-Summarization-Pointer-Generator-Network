Mesut Ozil will be carpeted by Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger after being spotted in a Berlin nightclub just hours after missing the club’s game at Newcastle because he had a cold.

The German international, the club’s £42.5million record signing, was left out of the match-day squad because he felt under the weather. And Wenger gave him permission to fly back to his homeland early to prepare for tomorrow’s friendly against Australia.

But instead of nursing his illness he was pictured in a club on Saturday night.

His decision to go out partying leaves question marks over his omission from the squad to face John Carver's side on Saturday.

And manager  Wenger will remind the club's record signing of his responsibilities in a face-to-face meeting when he returns from international duty following Sunday's Euro 2016 qualifier in Georgia.

Ozil would probably have travelled to Germany after the clash at St James’ Park anyway, but his actions after being allowed time off will leave Arsenal’s management unimpressed. 

Wenger rarely lets players who tarnish the club's reputation get away without, at the very least, a stern talking to.

Goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny was fined after being caught smoking in the dressing room following the New Year's Day loss at Southampton.

Likewise, Wenger has warned midfielder Jack Wilshere over his conduct after he was twice photographed with a cigarette.

After a mediocre start to his Arsenal career since joining from Real Madrid in 2013, Ozil is slowly starting to find his form.

Despite being caught out over the weekend, Ozil is still likely to start against Liverpool after the international break.
