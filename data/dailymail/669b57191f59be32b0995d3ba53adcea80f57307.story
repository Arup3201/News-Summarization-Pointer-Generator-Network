The widow of a man who died from cancer of the penis has urged others not to be embarrassed about getting suspicious symptoms checked out.

Chris Barber was just 52 when he succumbed to the disease - having been too shy to admit his symptoms before it was too late.

Now his wife Anita Barber is determined that no more men die of shame.

Chris Barber was just 52 when he succumbed to cancer of the penis - having been too embarrassed to admit his symptoms in the early stages.  His wife Anita, 51, is now determined to ensure no more men 'die of shame'

She said: 'My brave husband could not find the words to talk about his illness, but I am hoping that in doing so, more lives will be saved.'

Mrs Barber, 51, from Fakenham, Norfolk, said: 'I am haunted by the fact that more could have been done - had Chris not been too embarrassed to talk about his symptoms earlier.

‘Men should not die because of embarrassment and shame. We talk about breast cancer and testicular cancer, so why not this? 

She added: ‘Women are usually happy to talk about their bodies, but men are much more reserved and I honestly feel that attitude is costing lives and because of what happened to Chris I want to help change that.’ 

‘We’d been married for 32 years. We were looking forward to retiring together, we should have been growing old together. 

‘I couldn’t stop thinking about the early days and if it could have been different if he’d sought help and been diagnosed quicker?'

Since his death two years ago, Mrs Barber and the couple’s three daughters, Kerry Kid, 33, Sharon Jermy, 29, and Katie Finn, 26, have supported the Norfolk-based Blue Ribbon Foundation to raise awareness of male cancers.

Mrs Barber, who works as a GPs receptionist, said her husband (here on daughter Kerry's wedding day) put off seeing his doctor for weeks after experiencing pain in his genitals. It was six months before he sought help 

The aim is to encourage men to seek medical advice without shame and embarrassment.

Mrs Barber, who works as a GPs receptionist, said her husband put off seeing his doctor for weeks after experiencing pain in his genitals.

She said: ‘I noticed him wincing when he pulled his underwear and trousers on.

Bleeding

A red rash under the foreskin

Flat growths of brownish colour

Difficulty in drawing back the foreskin

Unusual smelling discharge from under the foreskin

Unexplained change in colour of the skin

Swollen lymph nodes in the groin area

‘When I pushed him he admitted things were uncomfortable below  - he was experiencing irritation and discomfort dressing - but he brushed it off as nothing and carried on as normal.

'Later it become difficult to move his foreskin and the first procedure he underwent was a circumcision. 

'I urged him to see our GP, but like most men, Chris put it off.

‘He said he was too busy at work to take time off but I began to suspect he was also embarrassed too.’ 

Mrs Barber says her husband, then aged 41, was a very private man. ‘He was a carpenter and worked in a male dominated environment. 

'He was a very strong and solid man and just wouldn’t have felt comfortable talking about intimate parts of his body.’

It wasn’t until six months later, in January 2001, that she tired of her husband’s procrastinating, rang their GP herself. 

She says: ‘I offered to go with him but he looked horrified so we agreed he would go alone. He came back after saying he’d need a minor operation and we both felt relieved that it was being dealt with.’ 

Mr Barber was 'a very strong and solid man and just wouldn’t have felt comfortable talking about intimate parts of his body', his widow said 

Following surgery the couple assumed that was the end of the matter, but after a follow up appointment Mr Barber returned to the couple’s home ashen faced. 

His wife said: ‘He told me that they had performed a biopsy of cells taken from the circumcision and these had been found to be cancerous. 

July 2000: His symptoms began

January 2001: Finally went to GP at  wife's insistence. Underwent circumcision and biopsy few weeks later, which revealed cancerous cells.

2003: Developed ulcers on his penis and returned to the GP

2004: Had more skin removed and began six-monthly check-ups   

November 2008: Had portion of his penis removed and reconstructive surgery 

February 2010: MRI scan showed cancer  had spread to his pelvis

August 2009: Starts chemotherapy    

October 2011: Passes away due to the disease 

‘I was shocked, I’d never even heard of cancer of the penis.’

But medics assured the couple they were confident all the cells had been removed.

However a few months later, Mr Barber developed ulcers on his penis. This time he went straight to the GP, who diagnosed cancer of the penis.

More surgery at the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital followed but the diseased tissue kept reappearing over the following years. 

Mrs Barber said: ‘It nagged in my mind that treatment had been delayed because he was too embarrassed to see the doctor. I wished I had pushed him into going sooner.’ 

By November 2008, consultants decided drastic action to try and keep the cancer at bay was the only option - and decided to amputate a portion of the organ.

 Mrs Barber recalls: ‘I gripped his hand but he didn’t flinch at all. I knew to him it was the ultimate indignity but he was determined to keep strong and brave for me. ‘I told him I didn’t care about anything as long as he was well.’ 

Despite the severity of his condition, Mr Barber continued to insist to his daughters he was fine. 

‘That was typical of him, he would not have wanted his girls to worry about him,' said his wife.

'As far as he was concerned it was his job to worry about them, not the other way around.’ 

Despite battling chemo that left him exhausted and sick, Mr Barber wrote a speech and walked daughter Sharon down the aisle on her wedding day

Mr Barber was such a private man that he told colleagues the reason for his hospital appointments was a bad leg - rather than his rare cancer 

When he needed to take time off for hospital appointments, he told colleagues he had a bad leg - because he was too embarrassed to admit the truth.'

The seven- hour operation to remove a portion of his penis and lymph nodes in the groin was a success and he underwent reconstructive surgery at the same time. 

Mrs Barber said: ‘He really didn’t look any different too me and when he was strong enough, intimacy was normal - but that really had been the least of my worries.’ 

But in early 2010 Mr Barber reported pain in his hips and thighs and was sent for a CT scan - with devastating results. 

It revealed a tumour on his pelvis and a consultant confirmed the cancer had spread and was now incurable. 

Mrs Barber said: ‘I broke down in tears when he said the only option was treatment to try and extend his life.

'But Chris just asked when could he start - I had never seen such bravery and courage.’ 

Mr Barber succumbed to the disease in October 2011, after battling an infection in hospital

The family are now supporting the Norfolk-based Blue Ribbon Foundation to raise awareness of male cancers. When daughter Katie married in June last year, the logo featured strongly in honour of her father 

His family rallied as he began chemotherapy and, fearing the worst, his daughter Sharon brought  forward her wedding day.

'She wanted her father to give her away and we didn’t know how much time he had left. Despite battling chemo that left him exhausted and sick, he wrote a speech and walked her down the aisle. He later told me he wouldn't have missed it for the world.' 

Over the following months, the father-of-three's health faded and in October 2011 he was admitted to hospital battling an infection. 

When treatment failed, his family was warned they were losing him. Mrs Barber and her daughters kept vigil, sleeping in their cars at the hospital to be nearer to him. 

It was daughter Sharon who was sleeping in a chair by his bedside when she woke to see her father had stopped breathing in his sleep. 

Her mother said: ‘She phoned us and we raced upstairs to her. It was typical of Chris to go quietly in his sleep with no fuss. It was the way he would have wanted. ‘I kissed him and told him how much I loved him.’ 

Mrs Barber said: ‘It was Katie’s way of having her father involved in her day and I know he would have been bursting with pride'

But as she planned his funeral Mrs Barber felt cheated - and wished her husband had sought treatment sooner.' 

So when fellow cancer patient Mel Lacey - whom Chris had grown close to in hospital - launched a charity to raise awareness of male cancers, Mrs Barber and her daughters offered their support.

The aim of the Blue Ribbon Foundation is to encourage men to seek medical advice without shame and embarrassment.

When daughter Katie married in June last year, the Blue Ribbon logo featured strongly in honour of her father. 

Mrs Barber said: ‘It was Katie’s way of having her father involved in her day and I know he would have been bursting with pride. 

‘Chris was the best husband and father we could ever have wished for. But he just couldn’t talk about his illness. That’s why we are doing it for him, because no more men like Chris should die of shame. '
