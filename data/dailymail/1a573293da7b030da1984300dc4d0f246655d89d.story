Steve Jobs played many roles in his lifetime, from entrepreneur to visionary. He introduced the personal computer in 1984 and then kept re-inventing technology right up to his death.

But here he is in a role that has never been seen before - playing American President Franklin D. Roosevelt in a spoof video aimed to inspire Apple's troops.

Jobs gamely plays the role - capturing FDR's trademark smile, on a set which mimics the President's office right right down to the President's cigarette-holder.

The video spoofs off Apple's iconic '1984' advert, which six months earlier had played at the American Superbowl and introduced the Apple Macintosh to the public.

In the original Superbowl video, directed by 
Ridley Scott, Apple pitched itself in a good vs evil battle against 
Microsoft, positioning Apple as a spunky, creative force which was going
to knock down the grey drones that used Bill Gates's software.

The
iconic imagery, dramatic overtones and sharp digs at Microsoft ensured Apple entered the public consciousness as the quirky game-changing company, and the advert became a metaphor for the 
company that has never died - even if, ironically, Apple today has become a lot more 'Big Brother'-like.

Six
months later, in the summer of 84, Apple held a summer retreat in 
Hawaii for the company's sales team. and a 29-year-old Steve Jobs 
stepped up to play FDR.

The nine-minute video was shown once and never seen again - until today, when a copy of the video was given to website NetworkWorld
by former Apple employee Craig Elliott.

He had held to a copy of the 
video, decided to 
share it with the world after realising how rare it is.

It's good to talk: 20 years after Jobs answered the phone as FDR, the Apple leader revolutionised the mobile phone industry with the iPhone

Very
tongue-in-cheek, the video starts with the same dramatic overtones as 
the Superbowl advert, with an announcer speaking over black-and-white 
footage: 'On January 24, 1984, Apple Computer introduced Macintosh. And 
we saw why 1984 was like ... 1944'.

Even
if this is just a corporate video to raise morale, the production 
values are huge- a rumoured $50,000 was spent on the nine-minute video.

Dozens of extras rush 
around a mock Apple army base as, on this occasion, they prepare to do 
battle with arch-enemy is IBM, the 'big blue mono-blob'.

While he could be a tyrannical boss, Jobs was known for his sense of humour.

He would often launch Apple events with a skit or video, and when he first 
launched the iPhone, in front of an auditorium of hundreds, he rang the 
local Starbucks and ordered a thousand coffees, before quickly hanging 
up with a 'sorry, wrong number'.

This is not the only found-footage of Steve Jobs to turn up this month: An hour-long 'lost' interview with Steve Jobs will be released in U.S. cinemas next week.The footage, filmed in 1995, was an interview between Jobs and technology writer Mark Stephens. Small snippets have been aired before but the video has never been seen in its entirety.
