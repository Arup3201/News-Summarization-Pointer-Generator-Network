A paramedic has dodged a disciplinary hearing after he left a heart attack victim to die in the back of an ambulance when his shift was over.

Senior clinician Andrew Orme abandoned ailing pensioner Norma Davies, 63, in May last year.

A hearing heard he failed to take adequate observations before leaving and left the pensioner with a technician and a driver who were ill-equipped to help her.

She died en route to the hospital.

It was the Merseyside paramedic's second major blunder, after he had failed to notice two-year-old Lewis Urmson-Brown had been badly injured in a playground accident in 2008.

After just a 15-minute assessment, Orme said the young boy did not need urgent hospital treatment and offered his worried parents little advice.

The toddler lost consciousness during the night and died with a blood clot weighing 56 grams.

Orme was hauled before the Health Professions Council for misconduct in 2010, but was given just a four-year caution and freed to continue treating patients.

However, after the latest incident, Orme has now quit as a paramedic. 

Orme avoided a second disciplinary hearing this week, choosing instead to remove himself from the register of approved medical professionals and effectively end his own career.

HCPC panel chair Helen Carter said a full hearing was not in the public interest, and would risk upsetting relatives of Mrs Davies.

'The balance falls in favour of permitting the voluntary removal, particularly as there is an unequivocal admission of the allegations and it will be known that Mr Orme will no longer be on the paramedic part of the HCPC register and will no longer be able to practise as a paramedic', she said.

Ms Carter also noted that parts of the hearing would have been restricted to discuss Orme's health problems.

The paramedic first landed in trouble six years ago, when two-year-old Lewis Urmson-Brown died after banging his head in a playground in Runcorn, Cheshire.

Parents Michelle Urmson and Chris Brown were both arrested on suspicion of murder, but when the injuries were investigated, the attention swung on to Orme.

Ms Urmson had noticed a small cut on her son's head and dialled 999 for help, telling the operator Lewis had 'gone floppy'.

Orme saw the boy for just 15 minutes at their Runcorn home but missed the injury and failed to advice the couple to check on their son at regular intervals during the night.

The disciplinary hearing in 2010 was told by Orme's representative, Ray Carrick, that he was 'a very very valuable asset to the community'.

'This is a good paramedic sitting next to me,' Mr Carrick claimed.

Melinka Berridge, for the HPC, had said: 'There's overwhelming evidence that Mr Orme had the competence to perform the task but simply chose not to do so.'

The Merseyside paramedic was given a four-year caution to mark the 'serious' failings, but was allowed to continue working without restrictions with the North West Ambulance Service NHS Trust.

He admitted a string of failings prior to the latest hearing and wrote to the panel asking to be struck off the register.

He admitted failing to provide adequate care to Ms Davies, including failing to perform an ECG, failing to enquire about her past medical history and leaving her with junior staff despite her critical condition.

He further admitted leaving the scene before the ambulance had gone to hospital, failing to travel with the patient to hospital and failing to provide an adequate handover to the attending crew.

Orme has agreed not to apply to be readmitted to the HCPC register following the voluntary removal of his name from it.
