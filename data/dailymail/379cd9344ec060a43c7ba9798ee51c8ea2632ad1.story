Newsnight host Emily Maitlis has sent a series of angry tweets deriding acclaimed director Spike Jonze after he took her on in an interview about his new film.

The bizarre spat followed an appearance by Jonze on the BBC's flagship news programme during which he tried to press Maitlis for her opinion on the Oscar-nominated film Her.

Jonze, 44, first asked her if she had even seen it and then repeatedly asked if the film, starring 
Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson, had 'moved' her.

The romantic drama stars Phoenix as 
Theodore, a lonely writer who develops an unlikely relationship with his
 newly-purchased computer operating system that's designed to meet his 
every need.

Maitlis eventually admitted it had moved her before Jonze had pressed on: 'Tell me, what moved 
you, Emily?'

The journalist replied: 'Our audience want to hear from 
you, not me.'

Later, Maitlis, who has 30,000 followers on Twitter, branded his film a 'sad, male fetish fantasy of disembodied female who does his bidding'.

Her next tweet compared Her to the hit Oscar-winning film Lost in Translation, a film made Jonze's ex-wife, Sofia Coppola.

She said: 'Like lost in translation for mood but nowhere near as good.'

Speaking via a video link from Hollywood, Jonze even questioned whether Maitlis had seen the film

Maitlis then retweeted a series of comments made by other posters on the interview.

James Thornton said: 'What a c*** Spike Jonze made of himself. over-precious a***. happy to 
get PR, then surprised focus on obvious conceit of the film.'

And James Forster said: 'I was considering watching 'Her' but not now after that interview. Just play ball Spike for f*** sake!'

Jonze's reaction is not known: he has not tweeted since 2009.

The Newsnight exchange follows another row between interviewer and film director last month.

Quentin Tarantino launched an extraordinary tirade at Krishnan Guru-Murthy after refusing to answer questions about movie violence.

The
 Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction director erupted when the Channel 4 News 
presenter asked whether there was a link between 
scenes in his notoriously bloody films and real-life attacks.

Tarantino,
 49, snapped: ‘Don’t ask me a question like that – I’m not biting. I 
refuse your question. I’m not your slave and you’re not my master.'
