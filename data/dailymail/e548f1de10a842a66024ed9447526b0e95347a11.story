Gay Pride parades stepped off around the world on Sunday, in cities large and small.

In the U.S., rainbow flags lined the streets of New York City's Fifth Avenue. Politicians including Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio were among those walking along a lavender line painted on the avenue from midtown Manhattan to the West Village.

de Blasio was seen wearing a rainbow tie and waving, as he appeared next to his wife, Chirlane McCray.

March participants wore an array of colorful costumes, many of which included rainbow items and accessories.

This year, Laverne Cox of hit Netflix series Orange is the New Black, Jonathan Groff of HBO series Looking, and Rea Carey, Executive Director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, served as Grand Marshals in New York.

Boy Scouts, along with a chapter of Scouts for Equality, also appeared in the march.

The march was broadcast live on YouTube, under the name #Pridecast.

Over 1 million attendees were expected in New York, CBS2 reported.

Marchers are commemorating the 45th anniversary of the Stonewall Inn riots that took place in June 1969, which are credited with launching the modern gay rights movement.

In Chicago, as many as 1 million people were expected to pack the streets of the city's North Side for the first gay pride parade since Illinois legalized gay marriage last month.

Charlie Gurion, who with David Wilk in February became the first couple in Cook County to get a same-sex marriage license, said there was a different feel to the parade this year.

'I think there is definitely like an even more sense of pride now knowing that in Illinois you can legally get married now,' Gurion said, as he posed for photograph after photograph with Wilk at the parade. 'I think it is a huge thing and everybody's over the moon that they can do it now.'

From the East Coast to the Midwest and the Pacific, seven more states legalized same-sex marriage, boosting the total to 19, plus Washington, D.C. The Obama administration moved vigorously to extend federal benefits to married gay couples. And in 17 consecutive court decisions, federal and state judges have upheld the right of gays to marry. Not a single ruling has gone the other way.

Parades were planned Sunday across the U.S., including in San Francisco, Minneapolis, Seattle and Houston. Humbler celebrations were being held in smaller towns and cities such as Augusta, Georgia, and Floyd, Virginia, while festivals were held Saturday in France, Spain, Mexico and Peru.

Among the marchers Sunday in New York were cousins Yaseena Oatis, 20, and Shayna Melendez, 22, from Plainfield, New Jersey.

'We're walking to celebrate, to be embraced being who we are around people who are like us, free to express ourselves,' Oatis said. 'Everybody has a different story about how they came out as gay, but we're all here.'
