'King of his castle': Former lawyer Paul Baxendale-Walker insists he was within his rights to build a helipad in his garden

For years the retired lawyers and businessmen of Hersham have enjoyed the peace and calm of their genteel village.

Until, that is, the arrival of adult TV boss Paul Baxendale-Walker.

The entrepreneur is building a helipad in the grounds of the £6million mansion he has bought in the heart of the Surrey stockbroker belt.

Residents are outraged, saying the concrete landing site is an eyesore and the resultant noise will wreck their quality of life.

But Oxford-educated Mr Baxendale-Walker, who sometimes stars in his pornographic films, is convinced he has done nothing wrong.

Responding to his Hersham neighbours’ concerns, the 48-year-old said: ‘Every Englishman’s home is his castle.

I am completely entitled to have a helipad on my land.

If they want a lift, they can just ask me.’

He bought six-bedroom Burleigh House earlier this year from a property developer.

It is near the prestigious Burhill Golf Club and is described by estate agents as ‘a sophisticated, welcoming house, designed in the style of a traditional English country residence’.

The helipad is being built on two acres once owned by a part of the Burhill group, which was founded in 1926 to manage the estates of Lord Iveagh, boss of the Guinness empire.

A covenant on the land says it must stay as a paddock.

‘We believe the helipad is totally inappropriate,’ said a spokesman for the Burhill Group. ‘We are taking legal action and it is now in our solicitors’ hands.’

Luxury: Mr Baxendale-Walker tore down the existing property to build a modern mansion in the village of Hersham

'Eyesore': Neighbours said they had hoped the film boss was turning the paddock into a Japanese garden - in fact he was installing a helipad

Malcolm Groom, 62, a retired oil and gas lawyer who lives next to Burleigh House, was one of the first to complain.

‘People like Baxendale-Walker choose 
this lovely area because of its quiet serenity and peacefulness and the 
moment they arrive they destroy what it is they were looking for,’ he 
said.

‘He says he can do what he wants with
his castle but what about our castle?’

Colourful character: Mr Baxendale-Walker, seen at a Loaded Magazine event in London, said he would be happy to give his disgruntled neighbours a lift in his helicopter

His wife Kim said she had 
discovered that a helicopter can land 28 times a year without 
permission.

Jean Connell and her husband John, a 
former chairman of The Distillers Company, have lived in their house 
next to the paddock for 50 years.

Mrs Connell said: ‘A few years ago it was a peaceful little backwater here.

‘Now if this man is going to be 
allowed to get away with it you will have helicopters coming in, their 
friends arriving.

He has got money coming out of his ears.

He has got a 
Harley Davidson and a stretch limousine.

‘Nothing bothers him and he thinks 
with all of his money he can get away with it.

He hasn’t even moved in 
yet.

We’re both in our 80s and want to have a peaceful old age.’

An Elmbridge council spokesman said 
an enforcement investigation had been opened but suggested that planning
permission would not be necessary.

Mr Baxendale-Walker, who was struck 
off as a solicitor six years ago, has varied  business interests which 
used to include Bluebird Films.

He uses the pseudonym Paul Chaplin 
and appeared as the character Jo-Kerr in a blue spoof of the Batman 
franchise called Katwoman.

Earlier this year he bought the lads 
magazine Loaded from administrators and announced the launch of Loaded 
TV, which would include an adult channel.

He is also a tax adviser.
