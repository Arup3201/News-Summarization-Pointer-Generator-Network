GIVE SNOWDROPS A CHANCE

Snowdrops will be pushing their little noses up out of the ground pretty soon. Early varieties such as Galanthus elwesii may be budding or even carry open flowers. If you have snowdrops growing where evergreen herbaceous plants such as epimediums or pulmonarias grow, it may help to clear away some of the leaves to give the snowdrops space.

Do this tactfully, removing only moribund or unsightly foliage. Take care not to walk on the ground where you know snowdrops are planted. The emerging shoots are vulnerable and could be crushed.

Take special care with epimediums. The wiry stems must be cut, rather than pulled. If you try to pull the leaves off, next spring's flowers will come away with the stems and leaves.

PROTECT YOUR HOLLY

Birds are getting hungry now and holly berries are magnets for winter thrushes. One doesn't want to rob the poor things but if you plan to gather your own holly for Christmas decorations, it may be wise to protect a small part of your tree with fleece until you've gathered what you need.

If you buy your holly, birds may pinch the berries from that, too, especially if you leave it somewhere tempting. Stand holly branches in a can or bucket of water to keep them fresh and leave them out in the cold and wet until you need them for decorations.

PRUNE THOSE BLACKCURRANTS

Blackcurrants produce their best fruit on stems which grew from the base of the plant last summer.

To maximise next year's crop, prune them now.

On mature bushes — more than four years old — remove any thin, weedy stems. Then, beginning with the oldest, cut a third of all basal stems back to the bottom of the plant.

Make sure you leave an evenly distributed number of stems, preferably with a hollowed-out centre of the bush. That will enable air to circulate more freely among the branches and for the fruits to receive maximum light. On young bushes, less than four years old, prune fewer old stems away and be sure to leave six-eight sturdy young stems on each plant.

Plant some gift ideas

Presents the green-fingered would just love to find under the tree 

Buying presents for a specialist is almost impossible. What would you choose for a golfer or an angler if you knew nothing about either hobby? Gardeners can be tricky, too, but here are some goodies that any gardener would be delighted to unwrap on Christmas morning.

FINE CUTS

Secateurs are garden essentials, and Swissmade Felco ones are still the best. They come in various shapes and sizes, but my favourites have articulated handles and are widely available in left or right-handed models. Model '10' (pictured) is for southpaws while '7' is for right-handers.

Felco 7 from £44.90, Felco 10 from £56, amazon.co.uk.

KEEP ON TRUGGING

PRETTY though they are, there's nothing twee about traditional wooden trug baskets. No container is handier for carrying flowers and produce to the house or for transporting hand tools. Trug Makers sells several sizes, including a brilliantly designed shallow trug, 'The Daffodil', for elegantly carrying flowers.

The Daffodil trug, £35.80, trugmakers.co.uk.

CONTAINED JOY

Every garden benefits from some well-planted containers, and classic lead planting boxes look superb. Few can afford (or lift) the real thing, but there are convincing lookalikes. A 30cm cube fibreclay box can cost as little as £25 from most garden centres. For something larger, Floraselect's 97 x 22cm Chelsea trough is a beauty.

Glass-fibre faux lead Chelsea trough (pictured), £109.99, floraselect.net.

HAND IN GLOVE

Garden gloves must protect from prickles but be sensitive enough for fine pruning. That's a tall order but Showa 310 Gripper Gloves (right) come close to meeting those requirements and cost £2.95 a pair from JUSTWORKGLOVEs. If you prefer disposables, try its Green-Dex biodegradable Nitrile gloves at £16.20 per 100 (boxed).

FLOWERING CHRISTMAS TREE

Not a conifer but an indoor azalea trained into a 50-60cm Christmas-tree shape. Available in red or white, they arrive covered in buds and ready to bloom. Mine, now in its second year, is repotted and flowering beautifully.

LIGHTEN UP

Solar power and LED technology have resulted in a huge range of low-energy garden lights. Some are rather naff-looking and shed feeble light, but a stylish solar table lamp is perfect for outdoor socialising during the warmer months of the year. I particularly like this basket one from Homebase (below left).

WINDOWSILL GARDENS

A heated windowsill propagator is the next best thing to a greenhouse. Cuttings root readily in the cosy conditions, and with the bottom heat, seeds will pop up with amazing speed. Two Wests offers the compact Fab4 (pictured), which uses only 10 watts.

FORK OUT

My spear & Jackson Neverbend hand fork and trowel set is more than 20 years old, used almost daily but still good as new. They have polished stainless-steel business ends — though the shine has long gone — and comfortable wooden handles. The angled or 'tanged' shafts keep the handles clear of the ground when working.

Spear & Jackson gift sets, such as a triple one at £18.99, are available from amazon.co.uk.

HEDGE FUND

If you have more than a few yards of hedging, make life easy with a cordless hedge trimmer. The Bosch AHS 48 LI has an impressive 48cm blade, capable of cutting stems up to 15mm thick. That's fine for most regularly maintained hedges. A threehour charge gives about 50 minutes running time.

Bosch AHS 48 LI, £99.99, homebase.co.uk.

BLOWING HOT AND COLD

For gardeners who like to keep a tag on frost levels or heatwaves, the Digital Min Max Thermometer by TFA is perfect. The numbers are easy to read and it's in an attractive grey casing.

Digital Min Max Thermometer, £24.95, thermometerspecialist.co.uk.

WELLY NICE

For fashion-conscious gardeners who like to slip their beautfully pedicured feet into the ultimate hautecouture of welly fashion, Le Chameau's Chasseur Leather boots are a snip at £340 (outofthecity.co.uk). For the rest of us, Dunlop Dee (right) is more the thing.

Dunlop Dee Calf Wellies, £14.99, expworkwear.co.uk.

BOOK WORM

The Gardener's Garden by Phaidon (pictured) is a compendium of the world's finest — compiled by such eminent garden designers as Dan Pearson and Madison Cox. This visual feast is not exactly a snip but you'll find inspiration on every page.
