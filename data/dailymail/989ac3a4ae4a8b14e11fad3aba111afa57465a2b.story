A bride-to-be was murdered by her fiance with a 'single devastating punch' during a drunken argument over whether to take a bus or a taxi home after a night out, a court heard today.

Caroline Finegan, 29, crumpled to the ground like a 'bag of potatoes' after Ryan Ingham, 26, ran at her at full pelt before striking her in the face, it was alleged.

One eye witness claimed Ingham had run at the victim and hit her a 'like car travelling at 40mph' before he started to shake her 'like a rag doll' as she lay on the ground in an act of 'wanton thuggery.'

The force of the punch broke Miss Finegan's nose, her eye socket and swiveled her head so violently that it tore blood vessels in her neck.

Trial: Ryan Ingham, 26, is accused of murdering his fiancee, Caroline Finegan, 29, with a single punch

But when Ingham rang the emergency services he could be heard telling her to 'get up' and even suggested she was faking her injuries, it was alleged.

During a 999 call as Miss Finegan lay dying, Ingham was heard telling her: 'Hello, wakey wakey. Oi monkey, get up, look you bashed your head. What you doing, your belly is showing.'

When paramedics arrived at the scene near Shudehill bus station in Manchester city centre at around 1am on January 16 this year, Miss Finegan was not breathing. She was pronounced dead later that day in hospital.

Manchester Crown Court was told that the bingo hall worker, who had five children from previous relationships, had met father of six Ingham in August last year, becoming engaged to him three months later.

In January they went for a night out together at Churchill's pub in Manchester city centre.

CCTV captured the pair as they appeared to be arguing after leaving the pub to make their way home to Stockport.

The couple were seen initially heading towards a bus station, before speaking separately to a taxi driver.

Eyewitness Anthony O'Connor, who had just left work after a shift at Manchester Cathedral, said he heard a woman shouting and saw a man run past him, towards her.

He said: 'He ran at her at a really full speed and then came into contact with her and with the punch she completely fell to the ground.

'The one thing that affects me that time - and to this day - is the way she fell to the ground. The only way I can describe it is if you had a bag of potatoes and if you drop them and they crumple. That is how she fell.

'As far as I am aware, the life left her instantly. She completely collapsed into the road. He did not stop running and ran four or five steps after.'

He went on: 'It was like someone hitting her in a motor car at about 40mph...

'He came back and immediately picked her up by the arms and that scene was horrific and it disturbed me. He dragged her onto the pavement and as he was dragging her her blouse was pulled up and her skirt was coming down.

'I said to myself "What a way for a human being to go." There was total disrespect for human life. It was horrendous. He started to shake her like a rag doll.

'I think it was a total attack of thuggery. He had no respect of human life and not respect for that girl. It was wanton thuggery. There is no excuse for it.'

The court heard that Ingham rang 999 claiming he was 'ex-army' and saying he was qualified to carry out first aid on the battlefield. When asked by the operator what caused the fall he said: 'I don't know because we were arguing.

'I ran over to her and next thing I know she was being a mong, lying on the floor, because we were about to get a taxi home. We were arguing about getting a taxi home. It is superficial. I am ex-army. I have got my battlefield first aid.'

He told the 999 operator: 'She is in no danger. She is just p*****. I do not know if she is faking it or not.'

CT scans later revealed extensive subarachnoid bleeding in Miss Finegan's brain. At 6.19pm on January 16 she was pronounced dead.

Francis McEntee, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant got into an argument with Miss Finegan possibly over whether they should take a taxi or bus to get home - the consequence which was to say he ran some distance up the road of Shudehill and struck his girlfriend with a devastating blow which she never recovered from.

'The blow he struck was sufficient to cause a fracture to her right eye socket and break her nose on the right hand side. The examination of these injuries speaks to the force that defendant used.'

Ingham of Blackley, Manchester initially said Miss Finegan had passed out and fallen over but later admitted they had been 'bickering' about whether to get a bus or taxi home.

He denies murder but admits manslaughter.

The trial continues.
