Brooke Mueller is reported to have been babbling about ‘mafia connections’ when she was forced into psychiatric care earlier this month under suspicion of heavy drug abuse.

When police arrived at her Los Angeles home on May 1 the 35-year-old was ranting about an imaginary FBI investigation of her ex Charlie Sheen.

The mother-of-two claimed she was an informant for the Federal Bureau and was going to bring her former husband down with her secret information.

According to TMZ, law enforcement arrived at her home after receiving a 911 call from a man who claimed Brooke had assaulted him.

Sources told the gossip website that officers on the scene believed that she was inebriated and appeared to not have slept for days.

Her children, four-year-old twin boys Bob and Max who she shares with Sheen, were present in the house during the incident.

Police called the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services, who were reported have had an open case on the troubled mother.

Upon making the call to Family Services officers took Brooke into custody under a section 5150 – a California Welfare and Institutions Code that deems an individual to have a mental disorder making them a danger to themselves and others.

Brooke was placed under a three-day psychiatric hold and was later sent to rehab.

Meanwhile, Brooke is said to be 
concerned that her child support - a whopping $55,000 a month - will be 
cut off by Sheen as their children are in the temporary custody of 
Denise Richards.

A source told RadarOnline.com: ‘One 
of the reasons she had her lawyer go to court on Friday to ask the judge
to strip Denise Richards of temporary guardianship of Bob and Max - and
have them placed with her brother - is because she is afraid that 
Charlie is going to cut off child support.’

The rehab veteran’s sole source of 
income are the child support checks, as the source explained: ‘Brooke 
hasn’t worked in years and is unable to keep a job because of her 
addiction to drugs.

‘Brooke doesn’t have any money saved and lives month-to-month on the child support.’

Despite being denied spouse support 
in her divorce from the movie star she did receive a $757,000 settlement
as well as $1 million from the sale of their home.

But Sheen has no plans to cut her off
just yet as the source said: ‘Charlie will reassess the child support 
issue with Brooke in the next few months and see where things stand. He 
wants her to get the help she needs.’

Although, his other ex wife Denise is an entirely different story.

Sheen is reported have offered to give Richards more money for taking care of his two children while their mother Brooke is in rehab. But the actress politely declined.

The show of gratitude comes after Sheen flew Denise home to Los Angeles from New York in a private jet so she could see her children on Mother’s Day.

The Anger Management star also pays Denise $55,000 a month in child support, but wanted to give her more as she tended to his four-year-old twins from his marriage to Brooke.

A source told RadarOnline.com: ‘Charlie is extremely generous, and wanted to make sure having the twins in Denise’s care didn’t place a financial strain on her.

‘Denise was thankful for the offer, but declined because she has the financial means to take care of them herself. She isn’t doing this for the money.’

Taking its toll? Denise looked very slender as she clutched the hand of one of Charlie's sons while picking up her daughters from their gymnastics class in Los Angeles

And Sheen is aware of just how fortunate he is to have the gorgeous actress in his life.

The same insider explained: ‘There have been many times over the last year that Charlie has said the best thing he ever did was marrying and having children with Denise, but the worst thing was ever letting her go.

‘Denise is the one person in his life that he truly trusts.’

The 42-year-old is intent upon providing the best possible environment for the boys but it isn’t easy, as the source explained: ‘Five kids under the age of nine in one house is chaos at times, but Denise manages.’

Adding, ‘All of the kids are thriving and love each other.’

While Richards won’t take more money for her act of kindness she did gleefully accept his offer to fly her home for Mother’s Day.

The Wild Things actress was ‘bummed to miss her special holiday on Sunday as she was in New York City to film her TV show Twisted.

But her former husband - with whom she shares two daughters, Sam, nine, and seven-year-old Lola - had his exclusive plane whisk her back to Los Angeles the same day so she could be with her kids.

Denise wrote on Twitter: ‘Greatest ex @charliesheen my mom's day gift flying me home on his plane so I can take the kids to school.’

The 42-year-old beauty married the Hot Shots star in 2002, but their union ended acrimoniously in 2006 and Denise later filed a restraining order against her ex-spouse.

However, the former lovers repaired their relationship for the sake of their kids and in recent years have grown very close.

The Starship Troopers actress - who also has a two-year-old adopted daughter, Eloise - was recently granted temporary custody of Charlie's two children with his third wife, who was placed under an involuntary psychiatric hold amid allegations of drug use.
