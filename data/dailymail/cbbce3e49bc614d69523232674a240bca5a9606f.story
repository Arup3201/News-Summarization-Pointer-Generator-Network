Amanda Knox did not tell her former lover and co-accused Raffaele Sollecito she had become engaged, his father has revealed.

In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, Sollecito's father revealed Knox had not told his son she was set to tie the knot.

Knox, 27, will reportedly marry Colin Sutherland, a 27-year-old musician who wrote to her while she was in an Italian prison and who she has known since middle school.

Meanwhile, a legal back and forth continues in Italy as Knox and her co-defendant and ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito fight back against their 2014 re-conviction by an Italian upper court for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher.

Sollecito's father, Francesco Sollecito, revealed Knox had not told his son she was set to tie the knot

The news of Knox's engagement was first reported in a Seattle Times column on Wednesday. 

Columnist Jonathan Martin writes that Knox confirmed the engagement to him via email but said no more. No date has been set for the nuptials.

Her ex-boyfriend's father, Francesco Sollecito said: ‘Neither of us knew about it. But then Raffaele has not spoken to her lately. He is not in regular contact with her.

‘But if it is true, then he is happy for her, it’s evident that she has found the right person. We are very happy for her.’ 

Doctor Sollecito said his son is currently in a relationship with Italian girlfriend air-hostess Greta Menegaldo.

However, they only see each other ‘from time to time’ as his son is very busy working with his lawyers and preparing for his final appeal next month.

Now that he has passed his degree, he has also been working as a computer engineer, Dr Sollecito said.

Raffaelle Sollecito previously said Knox was his ‘first love’ and they were ‘living in a fairytale’ when the horrific murder took place.

He later suggested they marry to give him the same protection she enjoys as a U.S. citizen, according to reports. Amanda refused.

Before her current love was revealed in September, Knox was known to be living in Seattle with her classical guitarist then-boyfriend James Terrano.

Sutherland once lived in Brooklyn but has since moved back to Seattle, where he and Knox attended middle school. 

She's now working at a Seattle bookstore and as a writer for the West Seattle Herald. Meanwhile, her case is headed back into the Italian courts once again in March.

Sollecito and Knox were first found guilty of murder in November 2009.

The killers' convictions were later quashed after experts said forensic evidence had been contaminated and they were released. 

Prosecutors then appealed that finding and the case was re-tried in March 2013. In January last year a court upheld the original verdict.

It seems unlikely Knox, who now lives in the U.S., will ever return to jail for the crime as she has repeatedly refused to return to Italy. Since the last verdict, Sollecito, 30, has stayed in Italy.
