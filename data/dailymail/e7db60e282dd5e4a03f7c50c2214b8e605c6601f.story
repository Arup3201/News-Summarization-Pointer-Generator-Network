Two brothers who attacked the cousin of former Strictly Come Dancing star Laila Rouass and left him to drown in a reservoir have been found guilty of manslaughter. 

Amran Chowdhury, 27, and his brother Misba, 24, were convicted of killing 20-year-old Ibrahim Gharib, whose body was pulled from the Shadwell Basin in east London in March 2010.

The jury was told that Mr Gharib, the cousin of actress Ms Rouass, had been with his girlfriend Seema Uddin, then 17, when the couple were set upon by a gang, including the Chowdhury brothers.

Guilty: Brothers Amran Chowdhary, 27, (left) and Misba Chowdhary, 24, (with his brother) were convicted of the killing of 20-year-old Ibrahim Gharib (right), who drowned in the Shadwell Basin in east London in 2010

Miss Uddin was knocked unconscious when she was hit by a bottle, the court was told, while Mr Gharib ended up in the freezing water. 

Two passers by had tried to rescue him from, but were thwarted by the cold, and his body was recovered the following morning by a police underwater search team. 

Although no witnesses saw Mr Gharib go in the water, the Chowdhury brothers were convicted of manslaughter at the Old Bailey on Friday for taking part in the attack.

Star: Mr Gharib was the cousin of actress Laila Rouass, who came fourth in the BBC’s Strictly Come Dancing in 2009, and starred in Footballers Wives and Holby City

They will be sentenced on a date to be set later this week.

After Mr Gharib’s death Ms Rouass, who starred in Footballers Wives and Holby City is now engaged to snooker player Ronnie O’Sullivan, said her family were ‘devastated’.

‘It’s a terrible waste of life,’ added Ms Rouass, who came fourth in the BBC’s Strictly Come Dancing in 2009.

Former couple: Amran Chowdhury’s (left) ex-girlfriend Steffi Rai, 26, (right) was convicted of perverting the course of justice by trying to help him evade the police

Amran Chowdhury’s ex-girlfriend Steffi Rai, 26, was convicted of perverting the course of justice by trying to help him evade the police. She will be sentenced on 3 October.

During the trial the court was told that Mr Gharib had gone to the dock basin with Miss Uddin, who he had been dating for just a week, on the evening of March 18, 2010.

Convicted: Rai, (pictured) who drove Amran Chowdary to Birmingham after the attack, will be sentenced next month

John McGuinness QC, prosecuting, said: ‘While these two young people were passing time together that evening, talking, chatting, drinking, they were set upon by a group of men - probably a group of five young men.

‘Two of the group were the Chowdhury brothers.

‘There is no eyewitness who saw Ibrahim Ghrib go into the water, not even Seema Uddin.

‘Nevertheless, it is the case for the prosecution that his death was not an accident.’

Mr Gharib was found floating in the water at around 9.30pm. He had bruises on his right cheek and right elbow and tests showed he was two and a half times over the drink drive limit.

A post mortem examination revealed he had drowned in the 30ft-deep water. 

Detectives found Amran Chowdhury's mobile phone in a nearby street, and although he admitted being there that night, he denied any involvement in the attack.

He had spent the night in a local hotel before Rai drove him to Birmingham.

Misba Chowdhury told police he spent the whole evening looking after his parents at the home he shared with his family, not far from the reservoir.

The brothers, both of Ilford, Essex, had both denied manslaughter and the alternative charge of affray, while Rai, of Queensway, Birmingham, denied perverting the course of justice.

Detective Constable Darrell Etchells, the investigating officer from the Homicide and Major Crime Command, said: ‘Today’s convictions mark the end of a long and extensive investigation to bring to justice those responsible for Ibrahim’s death.

‘No motive has ever been discovered for the attack but I hope Ibrahim’s family can find some peace in the fact that the jury are satisfied the Chowdhury brothers were responsible for his death.’
