A Coast Guard member shot two colleagues at a Cape Cod condo complex early Thursday, lit a car on fire to hamper police, planted fake bombs and then opened fire on officers, authorities said.

The episode, which police chief in the town of Bourne called 'crazy and hectic,' left one woman dead, another woman and an officer wounded, and the suspect in custody.

Coast Guard spokesman Ross Ruddell said both women involved were stationed on Cape Cod, while the suspected gunman was a man stationed in Virginia. 

Ruddell said he could not disclose the names of the victims or how they knew each other, but the suspect has been identified as Adrian Loya, 31, of Chesapeake, Virginia.

Ambush: Massachusetts police say Adrian Loya, 31 (center), shot two of his female colleagues at a condo complex in Bourne early this morning, killing one, before opening fire during a police ambush, hitting one officer. Loya also set fire to a car to block the only road into the complex and set up fake bombs, police say

The incident began about 2.15am amid reports of a vehicle on fire, but it quickly escalated into a 'crazy and hectic' scene, Bourne police Chief Dennis Woodside said. 

Police say Loya set fire to the vehicle to block the only road into the condo complex, and that he also set up devices resembling bombs, authorities said. 

Officers made their way around the burning vehicle on foot but were pinned down by gunfire, O'Keefe said.

One officer was shot in the back below his bulletproof vest during the ambush.

He took cover between two vehicles, but his fellow officers were unable to reach him.

Woodside described the officer as a veteran with at least 10 years of service.

After a half-hour standoff, Loya finally gave himself in to police and was arrested about 2.45am. 

Even then, police remained wary, because they were not aware if there were other gunmen.

Inside the complex, the surviving female victim had called 911.

Police entered the condo and found the other victim dead. 

The state police bomb squad examined the devices and determined they were all fakes that contained no explosives, Massachusetts State Police spokesman David Procopio said.

According to CBS Boston, Loya drove from his base in Chesapeake, Virginia, to Bourne on Tuesday and checked into a local hotel.

He then left the hotel about 2am Thursday and drove to the Cape Cod complex, where he burst into the victims' condo and started shooting.

He was armed with two rifles and a handgun, CBS reported. 

Loya reportedly had a previous relationship with one of the victims.

Loya pleaded not guilty to charges including murder, armed assault, home invasion and assault and battery of a police officer on Thursday afternoon during an arraignment in Falmouth District Court.

A judge ordered Loya to be held without bail and to undergo a mental health examination, and also ordered the file sealed.

Cape and Islands District Attorney Michael O'Keefe and Loya's attorney, J. Drew Segadelli, didn't discuss details of the case during the court hearing. 

Afterward, Segadelli said Loya and the two women had some type of relationship but said he couldn't comment further because the file was sealed.

Investigation: Police said the bomb squad responded to examine items suspected of being hoax devices found there, allegedly placed by the shooting suspect, who was taken into custody

The wounded officer was carried through the woods and snow by colleagues so he could be taken to the hospital, where he was stabilized and improving, the chief said.

Residents were at first told to stay inside their units, but Woodside later said the area was safe.

He did not disclose any other details or a motive, and it was unclear when the suspect would be arraigned.

The Coast Guard was helping in the investigation.

'Today the Coast Guard family suffered a tragic loss,' Coast Guard Rear Adm. Linda Fagan said in a statement. 

'We have chaplains and counselors on site to support friends and families affected by this crime. 

'My thoughts and prayers are with everyone who has been touched by today's sad event.'
