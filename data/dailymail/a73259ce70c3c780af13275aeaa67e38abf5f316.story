A mother is counting her blessings after surviving a bite from one of the most venomous snakes in the world.

Yvonne Lorch was trying to move an eastern brown snake away from her cat, who was toying with it in the living room of her southeast Queensland home, when the deadly serpent lashed out and bit her hand on Wednesday afternoon.

Unaware of the danger, she took it across to the next-door neighbour’s house, who insisted she call an ambulance and find out what breed of snake it was.

When ambulance staff arrived they said it was a non-venomous python or tree-snake, but Ms Lorch's daughter Lisa Hetherington resolved to get a second opinion, messaging local snake catcher Richie Gilbert an image of the snake.

‘We called an ambulance, and they told her it was a python or a tree snake. I wanted to make sure so I contacted an expert,’ Ms Everington told Daily Mail Australia.

The snake catcher quickly called back to clarify it was in fact an eastern brown snake, the second most venomous serpent in the world. 

‘We were in the hospital when he called. It was quite a shock, mum was pretty shaken,’ she said.

But a stroke of luck meant the snake had inflicted a dry bite, meaning it didn’t inject any venom.

‘She definitely feels pretty blessed. It just goes to show it never hurts to get a second opinion,’ said Ms Everington.

Yvonne’s daughter Lisa Everrington decided to double check with local snake catcher Richie Gilbert if the snake was a venomous species

Sunshine Coast Snake Catcher Richie shared the image on Facebook with the following message:

‘She is one very, very luck lady and she should buy a lotto ticket first thing tomorrow morning.’

Native to Eastern Australia, the eastern brown snake is notorious for its speed and aggression, rising in an upright S-shape when provoked.

Their venom can cause convulsions, paralysis and cardiac arrest. If left untreated, the bites can be fatal.
