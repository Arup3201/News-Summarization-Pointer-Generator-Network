Killed: Ibragim Todashev, 27, was shot and killed by FBI agents in May, more than a month after the Boston Marathon bombing

A Florida prosecutor has cleared an FBI agent of any criminal wrongdoing in the fatal shooting of a Chechen man as he was being questioned about a Boston Marathon bombing suspect.

Two law enforcement officials with knowledge of the investigation said Friday that State Attorney Jeff Ashton won't bring charges against the agent.

Ibragim Todashev, a 27-year-old mixed martial arts fighter, was killed in Orlando in May while FBI agents and Massachusetts state troopers questioned him about his friendship with suspected Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev.

Officials originally said Todashev 
lunged at an agent with a knife while he was being questioned. They 
later said it was no longer clear what happened.

Federal
 prosecutors have said in court filings that Todashev named Tsarnaev as a
 participant in an earlier triple homicide in Massachusetts. The filings
 were made in the case against Tsarnaev's brother, surviving bombing 
suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.

According
 to the filings, Todashev told investigators Tamerlan Tsarnaev 
participated in a triple slaying in Waltham on September 11, 2011.

Connections: FBI agents and Massachusetts state troopers questioned him about his friendship with suspected Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev

In that case, three men were found in an apartment with their necks slit and their bodies reportedly covered with marijuana. One of the victims was a boxer and friend of Tamerlan Tsarnaev.

The filing was prosecutors' attempt to
 block Dzhokhar Tsarnaev from getting certain information from 
authorities, including investigative documents associated with the 
Waltham slayings.

Authorities
 allege that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 20, and 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 
ethnic Chechens from Russia, planned and carried out the twin bombings 
near the finish of the marathon on April 15. Three people were killed 
and more than 260 were injured.

Dzhokhar
 Tsarnaev faces 30 federal charges, including using a weapon of mass 
destruction and 16 other charges that carry the possibility of the death
 penalty.

Tamerlan Tsarnaev died in a gunbattle with police as authorities closed in on the brothers several days after the bombings.

Both officials spoke Friday on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly about the case.

Ashton's report will be released Tuesday and hisÂ  office did not immediately respond Friday to calls and emails seeking comment.

The Justice Department also has been investigating but has not yet released its findings. A third law enforcement official said the Justice Department is expected to reach the same conclusion, based on a recommendation from the FBI.
