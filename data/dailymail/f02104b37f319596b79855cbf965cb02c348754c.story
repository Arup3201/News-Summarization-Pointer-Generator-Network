Petr Cech admits he would like Jose Mourinho to take over for a second spell as Chelsea manager.

Asked if he wants to see the ‘Special One’ back at Stamford Bridge, the Blues goalkeeper said: ‘We had a fantastic success with him, so why not? He is a fantastic manager.’

Chelsea fans united to sing Mourinho’s name during Saturday’s 1-0 home win against West Bromwich Albion and Cech said: ‘Of course, I understand that. Jose Mourinho did a fantastic job for the club and people loved him so he rightly deserved that. This is the way it should be.’

Eye on the ball: Petr Cech sees no harm in the way Chelsea are run

And Cech also spoke out in support of
the Chelsea way, defending the right of senior players to have their 
say and the right of owner Roman Abramovich to hire and fire as he sees 
fit.

The goalkeeper is the first 
voice from the dressing room to speak publicly since last week’s 
training-ground spat between senior players and Rafa Benitez.

Two
days later, Benitez took a swipe at the decision to employ him under 
the title of interim manager, suggesting it had undermined his 
authority, and confirmed he will definitely leave when his contract 
expires at the end of the season.

‘We do it our way, the other clubs do it their way, and it seems to work so far, so long may it continue,’ said Cech, who arrived at Chelsea in 2004 and has played under eight of Abramovich’s nine managers.

‘You can argue with a lot of things but in the same period of time we won more or less the same number of trophies as Manchester United.

‘They had one manager, we had eight, and we won the same  trophies. We won the Champions League, there are so many positives.

‘Arsenal
had the same manager and it is a long time since they won something. 
You can’t always say that is the fault of the manager or the players. 
Maybe if you asked them if they would rather have 10 managers and six 
trophies, I don’t know what they would say.’

Since
Mourinho built his title-winning team at Chelsea, the senior players in
the dressing room have developed a formidable reputation for the power 
they wield and they have never been afraid to take on the manager if 
they feel something ought to be said.

‘We had a lot of success thanks to the honesty and open mind everyone has in the dressing room,’ said Cech. ‘Everybody should have a chance to express an opinion, and if the players are not happy in our dressing room, it is not the case that we say, “Unlucky mate, we will carry on, you pick yourself up”.

‘No. If someone is not happy we try to help them to be happy again and to be at the top. This is why, when we see something is going wrong, people have the right to say, “We think this is wrong, we should improve that, we need to try to find a different solution”.

‘It is important for the manager to know the feedback. But there is only one boss and that is the manager.

Miserable: Benitez's spell at Chelsea has been an unhappy one

‘It is up to him if he wants to listen to what the players say or find his own way through.’

Chelsea
beat West Bromwich Albion 1-0 at Stamford Bridge, easing the pressure 
on Benitez by keeping the club on track for a top-four finish.

‘On
Saturday, you could see from the start we took control of the game and 
we created chances. The only problem was that we did not finish the game
off,’ added Cech.

‘There are things we are still not doing well but that is a normal  situation when you bring in a  new manager. It needs some time to gel.

‘The club took Rafa Benitez because they wanted to improve the situation and achieve the targets we had at the beginning of the season. He is here to do his best and to help us as much as he can.

‘As players, we must do the same: try to win games; work hard; move forward; achieve the targets. As a club, everyone should have the same feeling, no matter how long they’ve been here. We are the  Chelsea Football Club and we should be united: the players, the fans, the manager, his coaching staff, the board, everybody to achieve the targets.’

Hostility: Chelsea fans have never accepted Benitez's appointment

Intelligent and articulate, Cech has become the public voice of the dressing room this season. He
exhibits the mental strength and confidence typical of Chelsea’s senior
players, a by-product of the success achieved by Mourinho, who won five
major trophies in three years at Stamford Bridge.

Mourinho
arrived in 2004 and masterminded the club’s first title in half a 
century before successfully defending it. He also won the FA Cup and 
League Cup twice before a breakdown in his working relationship with 
owner Abramovich. He was sacked in September 2007.

The pair are understood to have reconciled many of their differences, although Abramovich still has reservations about the prospect of a return.

There was no major anti-Benitez protest on Saturday, but there were several banners displayed at  the game by Chelsea fans making their views clear on the interim manager.

Returning? Jose Mourinho remains a hugely popular figure at Chelsea

One said: ‘Divided We Fall Rafa Out’, another said: ‘The Interim One’ and another said: ‘We’re Just Not That Interim’.

Benitez
said: ‘We had to produce a good game and we did it. The players enjoyed
it, the fans were behind the team. Everything was positive.

‘What
will happen in the next week, I don’t know. I’m really pleased after 
winning, without thinking what will happen in the future.’

Despite the success with a revolving-door policy on the manager’s office, Cech would like to see the next manager given more time.

‘I have been saying that for six years,’ said Cech. ‘I hope the new manager will find the momentum and he will stay.

‘I’ve been here a long time and I’ve seen so many things that I don’t get surprised any more.’
