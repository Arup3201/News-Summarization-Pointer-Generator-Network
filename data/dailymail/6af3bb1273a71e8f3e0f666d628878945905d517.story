Much of the goodwill Hillary Clinton built up as serving as secretary of state has dissipated, a new poll shows, just as she prepares for a second bid for the presidency.

And her popularity has taken an especially hard hit since the public became aware that she operated a private email system while serving in President Barack Obama's cabinet.

A CNN/ORC International survey taken last weekend, after Clinton held a press conference at which she tried to explain away her secret server, found that Clinton's high approval ratings as an Obama administration official had entirely eroded.

Hillary is currently disliked by as many Americans, 44 percent, as she was in June of 2008 when she officially ended her presidential campaign and endorsed her future employer, President Barack Obama

She is currently disliked by as many Americans, 44 percent, as she was in June of 2008 when she officially ended her presidential campaign and endorsed her future employer.

That's a six-point drop from CNN's last poll, taken in November, when 38 percent of respondents said they weren't fond of Clinton.

Likewise, a slim majority, 53 percent, said they view Clinton positively, down from 59 percent a few months ago, and 69 percent at her career peak in the State Department in September of 2011.

Throughout her time as the country's chief diplomat Clinton generally enjoyed favorability ratings in the '60s. 

It was after she tendered her resignation in early 2013 that the public's adoration of her began to slide, dipping to 55 percent after she claimed last spring that she and husband bill were 'dead broke' when they moved out of the White House.

After a quick bounce back up to 59 percent late last fall, Clinton's likability now teeters above the majority water mark.

This as the Democratic politician is expected to formally launch her presidential campaign as early as the first week in April. 

Clinton's last known paid speech, to the American Camp Association, will take place on Thursday, suggesting an announcement will come within weeks. 

A handful of Democratic operatives are also rumored to be leaving their posts at the White House and elsewhere soon for top spots in Clinton's campaign network.

A total of 51 percent of respondents to CNN's poll said they believe the email system revelations to be either very or somewhat serious in nature compared the combined 48 percent who said the controversy was not too serious or 'not a problem at all.'

The same amount, 51 percent, said Clinton needed to better explain her motives and that they believed she'd done something 'wrong.'

The split indicates that while the public haranguing of Clinton over her use of a personal email address to conduct government business has mostly ended the subject could prove as an effective attack line for Clinton's Republican opponent in the general election next year.

Still, 52 percent said Clinton's actions don't disqualify her from serving as commander in chief, and 57 percent said they'd be 'proud' to have her in the Oval Office - up from 50 percent the last time CNN's pollsters asked potential voters the same question in March of 2014.
