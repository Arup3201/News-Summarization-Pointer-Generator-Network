A man who killed a university student after losing control of his car has walked free from court because he had an epileptic seizure when the accident happened.

Chloe Adkins, 20, a student at Aston University in Birmingham, died after being struck by a silver Mercedes as she walked along Hagley Road in Birmingham on January 25 last year.

Ian King, from Littleover, Derby, was arrested for causing death by careless driving but his case was dismissed by the Birmingham Crown Court because it was believed he had suffered a seizure and lost consciousness during the crash.

Ian King, seen here in a picture from Facebook, had his case dismissed after doctors concluded he had suffered an epileptic fit at the time of the accident

Paul Spratt, prosecuting, told the court: 'Mr King had no recollection of the accident whatsoever. He was unconscious in the car following the accident.'

Mr Spratt said the 56-year-old was tested in hospital following the crash and doctors said 'it was likely he had received an epileptic seizure'.

He had been 'clammy and sweating and his heart rate was increasing', the court heard.

Mr Spratt said: 'A specialist consultant believes a seizure was the likely reason for Mr King losing control of his vehicle.

Ms Adkins, who was a third year computer science student at Aston University, was described by her family as a 'beautiful person' who had 'touched so many lives'

'As this is the case there is no evidence against him so he is not guilty.'

The court heard King had been a heavy drinker and alcohol withdrawal may have been a factor in causing the seizure, which was the first one he had ever had. There was no alcohol found in his system following the crash.

Nicholas Syfret QC, defending, said: 'Mr King wishes to express his devastation and heartfelt regret for this tragic day.'

Ms Adkins, from Northampton, suffered multiple injuries in the accident and died in hospital a short time later.

Her family
 have previously described the third year computer science student as a 
'beautiful person' who had 'touched so many lives'.

A
 family statement said: 'Chloe had registered as an organ donor and we 
can only hope that her passing is of benefit to others. It’s what she 
would have wanted.

'She was a beautiful person both inside and out.

'She
 touched so many lives with kind words and support and had a close 
circle of friends who loved her and who will miss her dearly.'

Ms Adkins family said she had enjoyed scrap-booking and baking and making things for the home she shared with her boyfriend and two friends.

The statement said: 'Nothing can fill the void she leaves in all our lives.

'We love and miss her so much.'

This is not the first time a driver who has been involved in a fatality after having a seizure has escaped prosecution.

In June 2012 Peter Murdoch killed his passenger Elizabeth Thompson when he suffered a seizure while driving and crashed into a wall in Bowness, Cumbria.

Charges against Mr Murdoch were dropped after police discussed the matter with doctors and concluded Mr Murdoch wasn't in control of the vehicle at the time of the accident.

Philip Chapman from Rayleigh, Essex, however, was jailed for six years for causing a death after crashing following a seizure.

Linda Brooks died, and three others were seriously injured, after Mr Chapman crashed into four cars in Southend in September 2010.

Police said Chapman was playing 'Russian roulette' with his condition and had not properly informedlicensing authorities about the extent of his condition.

Epilepsy suffers are not legally allowed to drive if they have suffered a seizure during the last year which affects their consciousness and occurs while they are awake.

Those with the condition are required to inform the Vehicle Licensing Agency about the full extent of their condition.

In small amounts alcohol does not cause epileptic seizures. After three or four drinks the risk of a seizure is much higher.

Withdrawal seizures are most common among those who have abused alcohol.

They can occur in people with or without epilepsy, as they are prompted by the withdrawal of alcohol rather than the condition.

Binge drinking can lead to status epilepticus - a life threatening problem. Alcoholism has been linked with the envelopment of epilepsy in some sufferers. Seizure medications can also lower alcohol tolerance.
