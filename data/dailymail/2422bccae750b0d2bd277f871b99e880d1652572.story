From the first film that you saw with the love of your life to the movie you laughed at so hard you cried with your best friends ... many of life's moments can be mapped out through the films we have seen.

A new survey has revealed our movie timeline: from the first movie people want to share with their children, to films that help overcome a mid-life crisis.

And the results show that we are relying
on the best of British in times of need with Love Actually, Bridget 
Jones’ Diary, Kate Beckinsale and Colin Firth all coming out tops.

Love Actually was voted the film that showed people what love really was, made them believe in love, and the film that can help you get over a break up

Iconic British romantic comedy Love Actually was voted the film that both inspired people to get over a break-up and to find love.

The film's poignantly honest portrayal of love in all manner of scenarios and comic situations (think Hugh Grant dancing through ‘Downing Street’ to Girls Aloud) prompted voters aged 20- 30 to vote it the film that showed them what real love is (21 per cent).

The survey revealed that comedies 
clearly do more than raise a laugh too as American Pie (for men) and Bridget
Jones (for women) were deemed the top ‘coming of age films’ which 
helped people move from adolescence to adulthood.

Colin Firth as Mr Darcy in Pride and Prejudice set so many female hearts fluttering that he was voted the best celerity crush moment for the role

Mamma Mia!, the film based on the stage musical using the songs of Abba is credited with helping people get over a mid-life crisis

The cinematic classic It’s a Wonderful 
Life was voted the film that showed those who are over 30 the true value
of family, receiving 22 per cent of the vote, while the all-singing, 
all dancing Mamma Mia based on Abba songs was voted the film that 
inspired people to get over their mid-life crisis.

The cause of the mid-life crisis? Possibly seeing British beauty Kate Beckinsale 
don a leather cat suit in Van Helsing, she was voted the biggest celebrity 
crush moment for men with 14 per cent of votes.

A
young Colin Firth rise from the lake in clinging wet shirt in Pride and
Prejudice swung it for the ladies with 24 per cent voting him their 
biggest celebrity crush as Mr Darcy.

Kate Beckinsale in Van Helsing wears leather for most of the film so it is little surprise she is the biggest celebrity crush moment for so many

E.T. The Extra Terrestrial was voted the most inspirational rites of passage movie for children, with 28 per cent of the vote, while the film that inspired voters to grow from an awkward teenager into an adult was Billy Elliot.

Universal Pictures launched the poll as part of their invitation to the nation to create their own movie timelines, chronicling their lives through the movies that matter the most.

The movie timeline voted for by the public lists inspirational DVDs and Blu-rays that have helped us get through significant milestones including our awkward teens, heartbreak and midlife crises amongst others
