A mum who released a harrowing picture of her son as he lay dying from a legal high is spearheading a campaign get the shops which sell them closed down.

Jimmy Guichard, 20, suffered a heart attack and severe brain damage within hours of taking one of the herbal rushes.

His mother Karen Audino made the heartbreaking decision to turn off his life-support machine after he was found unconscious next to an empty plastic bag from controversial shop UK Skunkworks.

As part of her campaign to shut down shops like UK Skunkworks, she then released a photo of her son's last moments in hospital to show the damage the drugs can do.

The mother-of-three now wants authorities to enforce trading laws which force shops to know the ingredients of the drugs and the dangers they pose.

The mother of Jimmy Guichard released his  heartbreaking picture of her son last October. She hopes it will highlight the damage that so-called legal highs can do to those who take them

Karen Audino, pictured with Jimmy and daughter, Sam, is now heading a campaign to get authorities to enforce trading laws which could crack down on sale of the dangerous drugs

It would be the first time in the UK that current customer laws have been tested and could force sellers to clearly display all ingredients on packets or face closure and possible prosecution.

Ms Audino, 42, said: 'Anything that protects people and stops families like mine from being torn apart by these so-called legal highs is a good thing.

'I don't believe any of these products are safe and now that Medway Council is telling these shops that they must operate within the law I hope it will go some way to forcing their closure.

'My son's life just slipped away and that is something I want no other mother to have to go through.

'It's terrible that people can just go into a shop and buy these products as easily as sweets or a newspaper.

'I hope the action taken today will help put an end to these awful products. They destroy lives and destroy families.'

Keen sportsman Jimmy, who had applied to join the army, had recently moved from Ireland to Gravesend, Kent to care for his cancer-stricken father Martin.

He bought the legal high from UK Skunkworks shop in Chatham, Kent, on October 2 last year and was found collapsed on his bed at home in nearby Gravesend just hours later.

He regained consciousness after a heart attack but his brain swelled causing bleeding and severe brain damage.

His mother, a fast food restaurant manager, dashed from Ireland to be at his hospital bedside and he was pronounced dead on October 3.

Legal highs bypass drug laws by being sold as 'not for human consumption' and are often advertised as plant food or research chemicals.

They are designed to flout drug rules by possessing chemical compositions that differ from those already prohibited.

Jimmy's mother wants trading standards to close down shops which sell the drugs under existing laws

But now trading standards officers have said the products could be restricted by the General Product Safety Regulations 2005.

The legislation prohibits any unsafe product from being supplied to members of the public.

It means to comply with consumer law traders must know precisely what is in each of the products they sell and what risks are associated with the ingredients.

Ms Audino's campaign has already had an effect, with Medway Council in Kent sending letters to the 14 legal high shops in Kent setting out checks distributors should complete before selling legal highs.

On Sunday three legal high shops in the area were raided and samples were seized.

Trading standards officers hope to discover whether the shops are following the new guidance.

If they are not, the council could seek court action to see the items withdrawn from sale and ultimately force the shop's closure.

Trading standards officer Ian Gilmore said: 'We want the shops to know that we are prepared to take robust enforcement action to ensure they are operating within the law. These are not legal highs, they are lethal highs.'
