George Zimmerman has emerged from hiding to promote the company that made the gun he used to kill Trayvon Martin.

The first photo of the former neighborhood watch volunteer since he was acquitted of murder in July shows him smiling and shaking hands with an employee who works at Kel-Tec in Cocoa, Florida.

Zimmerman and his lawyer stopped at the gun maker's headquarters to check out the high-capacity Kel-Tec KSG pump-action shotgun.

TMZ.com reports that Zimmerman was interested in buying the weapon, though it is unclear whether he actually left with one.

In the market for a new gun: George Zimmerman was seen shopping for a high-tech shotgun at the headquarters of Kel-Tec arms

Making a statement: The Kel-Tec KSG holds up to 15 shotshells - nearly twice the capacity of traditional tractical-style shotguns

Kel-Tec is the same company that made the
PF-9 9mm pistol he used to shoot 17-year-old Trayvon last year. 
Zimmerman contended he killed the teen in self-defense after he 
sustained a beating.

TMZ reports that the son of Kel-Tec's owner personally gave Zimmerman a tour of the company in Coca, Florida, including a view of the manufacturing plant and showroom.

Zimmerman and his lawyer, Mark O'Mara, were looking into the legality of buying a Kel-Tec KSG, a cutting edge weapon that has two magazines to hold shotgun shells, according to reports.

He posed for at least one photograph with a worker at the plant.

It is unknown whether he actually bought the weapon.

The KSG can fire up to 15 12-gauge shotgun shells without re-loading, nearly twice the capacity of other tactical-style shotguns, which are usually converted hunting arms.The gun costs about $1,200.

Shotguns like the KSG are primarily used for home defense. Shotshells fire multiple pellets at once that are meant to spread out.

Zimmerman's 9mm pistol, also made by Kel Tec, was returned to him after he was acquitted of all charges in the death of Trayvon Martin

Controversy: Zimmerman says that supporters of slain teenager Trayvon Martin have sent his family thousands of death threats

They can be devastating at close range - and much more effective than the 9mm bullet fired by his handgun. Shotshells lose most of their effectiveness at ranges over 25 to 35 yards.Â 

Whereas Zimmerman's Kel-Tec pistol is small and concealable, the shotgun he examined is meant to make a statement. It emits an audible sound - familiar to any hunter or fan of zombie movies - whenever the action is cycled.

Zimmerman, 29, has been a free man since he was acquitted of all charges July 13 in the shooting of unarmed Trayvon. The racially-charged case brought thousands of death threats to Zimmerman and his family. A fringe black panther group reportedly put a price on his head, as well.

After his acquittal, police returned the pistol that killed Trayvon to Zimmerman. He was carrying it in his truck when he was pulled over in Texas less than two weeks later.

The former neighborhood watch volunteer from Sanford, Florida, was forced to flee his home and has been in hiding ever since the case began receiving international attention.

The KSG has two magazine tubes that can be loaded at the same time - giving the weapon a capacity of 15 12-gauge shotgun shells
