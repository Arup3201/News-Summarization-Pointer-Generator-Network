Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has said it would be absurd and facile to ban interrogators from torturing terror suspects.

His controversial declaration comes amid outrage over a Senate report into CIA torture tactics, which found no life-saving information was extracted using brute force.

Speaking to a Swiss radio station, Scalia, 78, said American and European liberals who say such tactics may never be used are being self-righteous. 

He said: 'Listen, I think it's very facile for people to say, "Oh, torture is terrible". You posit the situation where a person that you know for sure knows the location of a nuclear bomb that has been planted in Los Angeles and will kill millions of people. 

'Facile': Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia said it would be simplistic to rule out torture of terror suspects

'You think it's an easy question? You think it's clear that you cannot use extreme measures to get that information out of that person?'

Scalia also said that while there are U.S. laws against torture, nothing in the Constitution appears to prohibit harsh treatment of suspected terrorists. 'I don't know what article of the Constitution that would contravene,' he said. 

The 30-minute interview touched on a range of topics, including the financing of political campaigns, the death penalty and gay marriage, about which Scalia said he should not comment because it is likely the court soon will have the issue before it. 

Asked about money and U.S. elections, Scalia scoffed that 'women may pay more each year to buy cosmetics' than is spent on local, state and federal elections combined.

His comments about interrogation techniques echoed remarks he also has made to foreign audiences. 

In 2008, he used the example of the hidden bomb. 'It seems to me you have to say, as unlikely as that is, it would be absurd to say you couldn't, I don't know, stick something under the fingernail, smack him in the face. It would be absurd to say you couldn't do that,' he said.

A year earlier, Canada's Globe and Mail newspaper reported that Scalia invoked fictional TV counterterrorism agent Jack Bauer using torture to get terrorism suspects to reveal information that could help authorities foil an imminent attack.

'Is any jury going to convict Jack Bauer? I don't think so,' he said. 'So the question is really whether we believe in these absolutes. And ought we believe in these absolutes.' 

Scalia is the latest to weigh in on the controversy.

This week, a former SAS soldier who survived weeks of torture at the hands of Iraqi interrogators said the tactics can be used to prevent terrorists attacks.

Andy McNab believes security services have a 'moral responsibility' to torture suspects if innocent lives hang in the balance. 

The soldier-turned-author says torture can yield vital information if used properly - and will be used by authorities in the future to prevent terrorist attacks.

Evidence: A report released earlier this week revealed that brutal techniques used by CIA agents against Al-Qaeda suspects in the wake of the September 11 bombings failed to produce useful intelligence.

The former British Army sergeant told The Times he 'wouldn't think twice' about 'inflicting pain' on someone if he thought it could prevent an atrocity such as the 2005 London bombings.

He said: 'I would deem it a moral responsibility to interrogate, to physically torture him to get the information out.

'Torture is a really blunt instrument but it is an instrument that if it used right can yield results. 

'There will always be legislation to make sure that we don't do it, but we will do it... We could moan about tactical interrogation or we could moan about 24-28 people getting blown up on a Tube. It's a tough call.' 

CIA Director, John Brennan, admitted some agents had used 'unauthorised methods', but insists they gained some valuable information through techniques such as 'water-boarding' - which was used to save lives. 

McNab, which is a pseudonym he coined after 20 years of military service, says there are a number of 'quick, harmful, painful techniques' which can be used to effectively extract information from a captive.

He conceded that he only supported the use of torture immediately after a suspect was captured rather than months later, when the information they possessed would be 'out of date'.

The former special forces officer was himself tortured by Iraqi forces, after being captured on covert mission during the first Gulf War in January 1991.

He and three of his colleagues were taken to an interrogation centre in Baghdad where they were stripped of their clothing, beaten and held in isolation for over three weeks.

Each of the men were whipped until they bled - their wounds then sealed with a red-hot metal spoon. At one point, McNab, now 54, says his molars were forcibly removed with pliers. 

He was eventually transferred to another prison in Abu Ghraib where he was beaten for another three weeks.

Despite the unimaginable pain he was subjected to, McNab maintains that torture is 'a weapon misunderstood by those who were not inflicting or being subjected to it.

He said: 'At the moment there is this moral revulsion at what has gone on.

'However, if there was real time information that did actually save lives, we would be looking at it in a different way.'
