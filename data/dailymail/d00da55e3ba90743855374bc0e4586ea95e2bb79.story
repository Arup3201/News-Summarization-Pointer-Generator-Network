Plans to colonise Mars could be dashed by simple biology.

A series of experiments suggest that sex and reproduction are affected by changes in gravity and radiation.

In 1979, male and female rats were sent up into space by the Russians and refused to mate at all.

However, other experiments have shown that animal sperm grow longer tails - and swim faster in zero gravity.

There are also concerns that high levels of radiation in space damage the ovaries and testicles, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine’s annual conference in Honolulu heard.

Dr Joseph Tash, of the University of Kansas, said these parts of the body are the most sensitive to radiation. 

The eyes are next most vulnerable – and most astronauts need glasses after returning from space.

The Red Planet is considered to be the solar system’s most hospitable alternative to Earth. 

Professor Stephen Hawking has predicted people will colonise it – but not for at least a century.

Dutch firm Mars One plans to establish a permanent human settlement on Mars, with crews of four departing on a one-way ticket every two years from 2024.

It says that children are essential if a proper colony is to be set up – but not straight away.

It states: ‘In the first years, the Mars settlement is not a suitable place for children to live. The medical facilities will be limited and the group is too small.

Mars One's mission to the red planet (artist's illustration shown) has been widely panned by experts, with many saying the Dutch company lacks the technology or skills to have any hope of landing people on Mars

‘The human ability to conceive in reduced gravity is not known, neither is there enough research on whether a foetus can grow normally under these circumstances.

‘In order to establish a true settlement on Mars, Mars One recognises having children is vital. 

'Therefore this will be an important point of research.’
