Have you enjoyed a holiday romance? You're not alone.

More than half of Britons have had a fling while travelling, and many of them more than once.

But despite two thirds of British holidaymakers believing that 'what goes on tour, stays on tour,' a surprising number of romances survive post-holiday, according to a recent survey.

Holiday fling: More than half of British travellers say they have enjoyed a romance while abroad

Going the distance: One in five of flings last more than a year after the holiday - and 1 in 10 result in marriage!

Research by online travel agent LoveHolidays.com reveals that a staggering 30 per cent of flings continue once holidaymakers are back on home soil.

Further, one in six relationships last more than a year, while one in 10 result in marriage.

And though the numbers suggest that many Britons are finding true and lasting love abroad, there are many more amorous travellers enjoying some more short-lived fun.

Misbehaving Britons: It's not all hearts and flowers though... 13% kiss more than three people in one night

'Good morning... beautiful': One in five forget their holiday romance's name the next morning

According to those surveyed, 13 per cent of British holidaymakers have kissed more than three people in one night, while 11 per cent would sleep with a holiday romance on the first night they met.

One in five have forgotten their partner's name the next morning.

It appears taste in partners changes on holiday too, with one in four revealing they are attracted to different qualities on holiday than they would be back home.

A tiny three per cent of those surveyed look for intellect and stimulating conversation in their holiday romance, whereas one third are attracted to good looks, and even more to someone who can make them laugh.
