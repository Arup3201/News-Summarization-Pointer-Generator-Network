The sovereign state of Brunei, perched on the north coast of Borneo, is described as the 'forgotten jewel of South East Asia'. It certainly was when I visited 30-odd years ago and was dropped by helicopter on to an unexplored ridge.

Back then, at the age of 20, I was almost overcome by the primeval beauty of it all - particularly the lilting gibbon calls at dawn and range after range of majestic trees.

Anyway, it was about time I went back to see how the little sultanate had fared - after all, the bulk of Borneo (the rest comprises Kalimantan, the Indonesian portion of the island, and the two Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak) had, in the ensuing years, been widely abused, if not clear-felled.

I was bracing myself. The country's vast oil reserves have led to it becoming one of the richest per capita on the planet, in sixth place. Britain comes in at only 22nd.

Sure enough, things had changed. 

Bandar Seri Begawan, the capital, was no longer a backwater but a sleek, clean place of breathtaking mosques and balmy avenues. It says something about 21st Century Brunei that my guide, Tom, suggested I might like to experience - after a leisurely dusk river trip - the 'Harley-Davidson bike evening tour'. On our river trip, a boat whisked us into tranquil waterways, abode of salt-water crocodiles, flying foxes and monitor lizards. The sun dipped serenely over the mangroves while proboscis monkeys munched on leaves, kingfishers dipped, and egrets returned to their roosts.

Then it was back to my gloriously immodest accommodation, the mighty Empire Hotel and Country Club. This featured a luxurious manmade beach - next to a luxurious natural beach. It was hard to imagine going anywhere more lavish - though we managed it at the Jame'Asr Hassanil Bolkiah Mosque, whose gate railings are capped with 18-carat gold, sapphires and rubies.

Next up was the Istana Nurul Iman, the royal palace.

My visit coincided with the annual festival of Aidilfitri, when the Sultan extends a personal greeting to his people. It's the ultimate open-house party at the world's largest residential palace, which, at the last count, had 1,888 rooms and 290 bathrooms.

I joined the throng of scrupulously turned out families to be conducted through ever grander halls. Finally, the 29th Sultan, Hassanal Bolkiah, the richest man in the world, was before us, there to shake hands with each male subject. In an adjoining chamber his consort greeted the women. The Sultan and his family greeted 73,000 visitors during the two-day festival.

But I had come here for the jungle - encouraged by reports that 97 per cent of the primary forest was still pristine. So it was off into the Ulu Temburong National Park by longboat into the emerald interior.

After a couple of hours we came upon the Ulu Ulu Resort - a peaceful retreat among the soaring trees with well appointed cabins constructed along a boardwalk. This means that without actually having to step into the vegetation, you may peer at frogs with sucker feet, observe a pygmy squirrel, or prod one of those engaging crickets that resemble a fallen leaf.

We went off on a forest trek, which was utterly enchanting: a giant lizard striped like a zebra splayed itself on a stone; a bat snoozed under a leaf. Then the horned frog uttered its cry - the signal for a downpour - and we retreated.

But the highlight was the misty dawn - and those gibbons with their eerie early morning call.

At Ulu Temburong the effect is magnified by a discreet walkway lately constructed right above the tree canopy. What a sight - spectacular and stirring. The forests here had endured. I don't think any visitor could forget that rather private experience of seeing the sun rise through an endless kingdom of orchid-laden trees.

That, I thought to myself as we took the longboat downriver, is what travel is about: gathering what secret jewels we may along the way.
