When Perfect Dark Zero graced the Xbox 360, it served as a stunning showpiece of the console’s power. Entertaining it was not.

The same can be said for Dead Rising 3. Indeed, when you’re first treated to hundreds of the undead roaming the streets of Los Perdidos, California, it’s a wonderful glimpse inside the Xbox One’s graphical potential.

Sadly, within 30 minutes, boring, repetitive mission structure sets in and undoes all the hard work.

View to a kill: make too much noise and you'll quickly be surrounded by hordes of the undead

Set 10 years after the events of Dead Rising 2, you play Nick Ramos, who has to escape the city before the army levels it with airstrikes. Basic plot, yes – but in similar vein to the other games, Dead Rising 3 tries to make the battle for survival as entertaining as possible.

A large part of this revolves around the combat. Los Perdidos is littered with potential weapons – from plant pots and hairdryers, to more damaging kitanas, baseball bats, guns and machetes.

But it’s the ability to create and combine weapons that hold the most intrigue, the best of which involves splicing a motorcycle engine with some boxing gloves. Vehicles, too, can be modified.

Full steam ahead: the RollerHawg (above) is easily the best combination vehicle in the game

Strewn around the city, usable cars, bikes and lorries are indicated by flashing lights. In their ‘naked’ form, they’re easily damaged – with several zombies hanging on to your bumper and bonnet within seconds of starting the engine.

But when spliced with other vehicles, they become different beasts all together. The RollerHawg is  perhaps the best example – a mix of motorbike and a steamroller, mounted with flamethrowers and capable of mowing down undead hordes within seconds.

There are also plenty of costumes around – ranging from sports wear, full-on mascot outfits and more casual offerings.

Dead Rising 3 tries so hard to please, but sadly the gimmicks can't hide the paper-thin gameplay. Mission structure too often involves running from one place to another, bashing some baddies or finding some item of interest, before returning.

Psycho: this fellow is one of the game's early, human bosses - yet he takes hundreds of bullets to bring down

Backtracking is a soul-destroying affair, and it plagues Dead Rising 3. Boss battles, too – although the foes remain as varied as ever – are not particularly enjoyable.

Often involving human foes rather than the undead, it’s ironic and absurd when watching a boss take 100s of bullets to the face, only to watch them shake it off and carry on. It just jars with the rest of the game...

Driving too, isn’t as fun as it could be. Although there’s a variety of sports cars and motorbikes, the inclusion of these high-performance vehicles is odd, as - given how cramped the roads are – you’ll never come close to their top speed.

Crash landing: the city may be large in scale, but roads are cramped and cumbersome to meander

The driving sections also highlight a more sinister problem… slowdown. As impressive the hordes of zombies are, the console does struggle when things get hectic (and this happens a lot).

Textures will pop up, items will float in the air for no reason. These are problems expected of a launch title, but are nevertheless slightly disheartening.

Still, it’s a solid entry into the series, even though it’s largely a case of style over substance.

Dead Rising 3 is an Xbox One exclusive. It is released on Friday.
