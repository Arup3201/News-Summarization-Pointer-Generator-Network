From silvery sardine skins to colourful peacock feathers, nature is full of surfaces that dazzle brighter than anything humans can create.

Now British researchers have revealed that there is a 'universal explanation' behind the amazing colours in the natural world.

They claim that the same microscopic layers of crystals are responsible for the reflective scales of fish as they are for iridescent colours on butterfly wings.

According to a report by Victoria Gill in the BBC, the world's creatures have evolved tiny structures that make use of light better than  man-made structure.

Researchers at Bristol University claim that the process in nature could be copied by humans to create, for instance, LEDs that are more efficient.

'What's important is that the crystals have a range of different thicknesses,' Dr Tom Jordan, a member of the research team, told the BBC.

Varying levels of these nanoscale crystals can be found in creatures such as beetles, butterflies and sardines, all of which produce an effect known as Anderson localisation.

This refers to a physical phenomenon in which light waves are prevented from passing straight through a material

In 1958, Philip Anderson published an article in which he discussed the behaviour of electrons in a dirty crystal. 

He claimed light cannot spread in a straight line in a cloudy medium because the many layers of crystal divert the light as defects.

If the disorder - the concentration of defects - exceeds a certain level, the waves are no longer able to spread in a cloudy medium at all.

 Varying levels of these nanoscale crystals can be found in creatures such as beetles, butterflies and sardines, all of which produce an effect known as Anderson localisation. 

As the light  goes in and meets these changes in the different layers, the multiple waves all interfere with each other.

The light moves around inside the layers and is reflected back out, producing a colourful metallic effect.

'As the light [wave] goes in and meets these changes in the different layers, the multiple waves all interfere with each other,' lead scientist on the study, Dr Nicholas Roberts told the BBC.

The light moves around inside the layers and is reflected back out, producing a colourful metallic effect.

In an earlier study on this same topic, Dr Roberts said fish may have evolved this multilayer structure to help conceal them from predators.

'These fish have found a way to maximise their reflectivity over all angles they are viewed from,' he said.

'This helps the fish best match the light environment of the open ocean, making them less likely to be seen.'

As a result of this ability, the skin of silvery fish or the colours in a peacock feather could hold the key to better optical devices.

Many modern day optical devices such as LED lights and low loss optical fibres use these non-polarising types of reflectors to improve efficiency, explained Dr Jordan.

'However, these man-made reflectors currently require the use of materials with specific optical properties that are not always ideal,' he added.

The mechanism that has evolved in fish overcomes this current design limitation and provides a new way to manufacture energy efficient lights.
