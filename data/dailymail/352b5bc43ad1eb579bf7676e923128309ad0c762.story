When Mario Testino compared Cara Delevingne to Kate Moss, it is unlikely he was thinking of the picture on this picture.

Nonetheless, the 20-year-old catwalk sensation showed she can match the supermodel in more ways than one.

On a mammoth night of 12 hours of partying she managed to take in four top venues and hook up with a string of stars.

It was the kind of effort Miss Moss would have been proud of and ended in true style – with Miss Delevingne on her bottom after stumbling out of a house party at 5am yesterday.

The young model’s marathon began shortly after her second appearance of the day at London Fashion Week – at the Burberry show at 4pm.

By 6.30pm, casually dressed in a hoody and skinny trousers, she and friend Georgia May Jagger, daughter of Sir Mick, had turned up at East London pub The Cockpit, where they stayed for an hour and a half.

Miss Delevingne then moved on to the War Child Brit Awards concert with Muse at the O2 Shepherd’s Bush Empire where she bumped into One Direction star Harry Styles, whom she is rumoured to have once dated, singer Rita Ora and pop star Will.I.Am.

From there, she popped in to the Dazed and Confused party at the Café Royal at around 11.30pm, where she chatted with Kate Moss’s husband Jamie Hince before heading to a bash at the West London home of football agent Dave Gardner.

It was as she left there, alone, that 
she lost her footing. By the time she eventually made it home, she is 
thought to have been up for the best part of 24 hours.

It was a night out even Miss Moss 
would have been proud of. Memorably, her wilder outings have included 
planning four parties spanning 34 hours to mark her 34th birthday - 
although she called it a day after 18 hours.

But while Miss Delevingne and Miss Moss, now 39, both enjoy a good night out, in other ways they could not be more different.

The former was raised in a Belgravia 
mansion, is granddaughter of Sir Jocelyn Stevens, the former boss of 
English Heritage, and the Delevingne family are well-established members
 of London’s society scene. Her grandmother was a lady-in-waiting to 
Princess Margaret, her mother Pandora was a society beauty during the 
1980s who counts the Duchess of York as one of her close friends, and 
her godmother is Joan Collins.

It is all rather a far cry from the humbler origins of Croydon-born Miss Moss, who has been Britain’s top model since the 1990s.

Aside from their waif like frames, it 
was a similarity in the two’s energy, attitude and personality which 
prompted celebrated photographer Mario Testino to label Miss Delevingne 
‘the new Kate Moss’.

Testino labelled Miss Delevingne ‘the new Kate Moss’ after recognising a similarity in the energy and attitude of the pair.

In response, the younger model has said: ‘It’s crazy to even be considered in the same calibre as Kate, it’s a huge compliment but scary even to be mentioned in the same breath.’

Either way, Testino was clearly on to something.

But no one can say 2012 was not a brilliant year for her. In addition to earning Testino’s praise, she won the Model of the Year award at the British Fashion Awards and starred in the famous Burberry advertising campaign alongside Romeo Beckham for which she earned £570,000. She has also appeared on the cover of fashion magazine Vogue.

Miss Delevingne, who is now said to be moving into a north London flat recently bought by her best friend Miss Jagger, has struck up a relationship with 18-year-old singing sensation Jake Bugg, who grew up on a tough Nottingham council estate.

The singer-songwriter, who has been compared to Bob Dylan, attended the Burberry catwalk show on Monday afternoon.

The pair have already been on a string of dates since meeting at the beginning of last month when the singer-songwriter performed at an event hosted by Burberry.

Speaking about Miss Delevingne’s relationship with the musician, her mother said: ‘I don’t think it’s anything serious at the moment. But she has told me about Jake and she says she thinks “he’s cute”.

‘I think they have been on a couple of dates together. I haven’t met him yet although I’m looking forward to meeting him. I think it is very early days.’
