You can't buy me love, goes the song - but it appears that money, or lack of it, can keep you in a dead relationship.

Nearly one in five people in the UK say they have had to sustain a romance for longer than they wanted because they could not afford to break it off.

A new poll has found that nearly a fifth (19 per cent) of adults have at some stage in their lives remained with a partner purely because of their financial situation. This is equivalent to more than 9.5 million people across the country.

A fifth of people have stayed with a partner longer than they wanted too because breaking up was too expensive

Of those who have stayed in relationships for longer than they wanted to, one in five (20 per cent) did so for up to three months.

However, the majority stayed with a partner they no longer wanted to be with for far longer.

The realities of shared bills, rent and mortgages mean that separating is no longer just an emotional exercise

Worryingly, more than two-fifths (43 per cent) of respondents admitted they had stayed in a relationship for a year or more after they thought it should end because their financial situation meant they didn’t feel they could leave.

And a shocking quarter (24 per cent) of these respondents remained in the romantic partnership for more than three years after things went stale.

Those aged between 25 and 34 years old are the most likely to remain with a partner just because of their joint finances, with nearly a third (31 per cent) of this age group revealing they have done so at some point.

This might be because it’s at this age that people are most likely to take their first steps on the property ladder or start a family, and it compares to less than one in 10 (8 per cent) over-55s who have done the same.

London has the highest proportion of couples admitting they have stayed together for the finances – and little else. More than a third (36 per cent) of respondents in the capital revealed they have remained in a relationship for just this reason in the past, compared to just one in 10 (12 per cent) people in the West Midlands.

Spokesman for Debt Advisory Centre, who conducted the study, Ian Williams says: 'It’s shocking to hear that so many people feel forced to stay in a relationship for longer than they want to because of their finances, but it’s perhaps not that surprising.

Those aged 25- 34 years old are the most likely to remain with a partner because of their joint finances, perhaps because it's when people are most likely to take their first steps on the property ladder

'It’s tough to end the bonds we create in a relationship, and financial ties can often be the hardest to break.

'Joint debts, mortgages or rent and childcare costs all play a part in people choosing to stay in a relationship when love breaks down, if they think they’d be unable to afford these costs alone. Data for Debt Advisory Centre last year revealed 12 per cent of people seeking debt help did so as a result of a relationship break-up.

'If finances start to spiral out of control when a relationship ends, the sooner people seek help with their debts, the sooner they can start to work towards getting back in control of their money.”
