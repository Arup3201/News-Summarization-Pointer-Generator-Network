Jose Riga lauded his Blackpool players for focusing on the task in hand as they ended a six-month wait for a victory amid protests against the club's owners in the stands.

Fans disillusioned with the Oyston family's handling of the Seasiders since their top-flight demotion in 2011 targeted Friday night's home clash against Cardiff as a perfect opportunity to vent their frustrations publicly.

After 53 minutes - a symbolic number for Tangerines supporters because 1953 was the year of the 'Matthews Final' - large swathes of the crowd poured down to the advertising hoardings or left the stadium, with three fans even forcing the game to be stopped as they invaded the pitch.

Prior to that point Riga's men had been on top, but their concentration never relented as Francois Zoko fired home a 64th-minute winner in a deserved 1-0 victory which lifted them off the foot of the Sky Bet Championship table.

'I'm happy just because it's a result of good collaboration and we forgot all that's happened around to focus on our job; we deserve it,' the Belgian said.

'The fans were even more behind us (after the goal) because that was the message I delivered to the players: keep going and do your job.

'That's all what I ask and just what the fans ask, even those who protest.

'They did well because it's not so easy. Even with a reduced number of fans you feel the sphere and you have the will and the power to go until the end and that's what we do.'

Blackpool now head into the international break on a high, having experienced a winning feeling for the first time this season.

The last time Championship clubs took a two-week hiatus for international games, Riga's job was openly touted to Burton's Gary Rowett by chairman Karl Oyston.

Riga and Oyston have since forged an uneasy alliance - although the tension continues to simmer - and the Belgian, as he has always done, reiterated his commitment to the Seasiders.

He added: 'My idea from day one is not to leave the club. There are many things that have been said but I was there all the time working hard so why I have to leave now...

'As manager you never decide but I repeat I just want to do my job here and to succeed with Blackpool.'

Riga's position was definitely strengthened by this win, but the defeat for Cardiff further emphasised their need to exit managerial limbo soon.

Prospective boss Russell Slade was at Bloomfield Road and is expected to officially assume the role early next week when the final compensation issues are ironed out with his former employers Leyton Orient.

With Slade's arrival seemingly imminent, joint caretaker managers Daniel Gabbidon and Scott Young were disappointed to know they were signing off with a defeat.

'With Russell's experience and the quality of players we have at the club, we can still be promoted,' Gabbidon said.

'I hope he has time to get his points across. There isn't much wrong. There are small things we must improve on.

'Game-management has to be better and we must improve on decision-making. That wasn't good enough at times.

'The new manager is experienced and will be ready for the test ahead.'
