With Halloween barely over, Harrods has already brought in the Christmas cheer by switching on its festive lights marked by a spectacular firework display.

The iconic department store set alight London's night sky tonight as it launched its fairy tale themed shop windows.

Spectators witnessed some 11,000 bulbs, sparkling faux-hedges in each shop window and two twinkling 30ft 
Christmas trees.

As the lights went on, a dazzling array of fireworks shot from Harrords' roof and exploded into the darkness.

magically lit up.

Earlier in the day, 10 window displays inspired by Disney Princess dresses went up.

Harrods' iconic store front windows are 
renowned for their dazzling displays, and in preparation for the holiday
season the store have teamed up with Disney to delight shoppers and 
tourists.

Anyone walking along the Brompton road from today will be greeted with an array of stunning gowns, designed by top fashion labels but inspired by Disney princesses.

Each dress will be displayed in pride of place within a 'magical themed backdrop' and will be a unique interpretation of the 10 original Disney Princess.

Unsurprisingly, given Harrod's world wide reputation for luxury and glamour, top designers have agreed to take part, including Missoni, Versace and Roberto Cavalli.

While some of the designers have stayed along the more traditional image of a princess with full skirts and beautiful embellishment, others have given the princess a distinctively modern twist.

Frog, and Rapunzel from Tangled all having a gown uniquely crafted after
them.

The display revealed today is sure to delight fashionistas, children and tourists alike.

And there are many more firework displays to come as Bonfire Night approaches.
