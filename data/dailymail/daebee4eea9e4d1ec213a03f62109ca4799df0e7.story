Doctors have diagnosed Kansas City Chiefs' Eric Berry with Hodgkins lymphoma, confirming fears that the  safety has cancer.

It comes two weeks after the squad's medical team discovered a mass on Berry's chest, prompting a series of MRI scans. 

The 25-year-old will now be entered into a program of chemotherapy, sidelining him for the rest of the season - his fifth with the Chiefs.

His surgeon, Dr Christopher Flowers at the Emory University School of Medicine, insists the disease is a 'very treatable and possibly curable' form of cancer.  

'I will embrace this process and attack it the same way I do everything else in life. God has more than prepared me for it,' Berry said in a statement. 

'I want to thank the Emory University School of Medicine, along with Dr. Flowers and his team, for all of their hard work and effort in diagnosing and creating a plan for me to battle this thing.'

Hodgkin's disease, also called Hodgkin's lymphoma, is a cancer of the immune system that only represents about 8 percent of all diagnosed lymphomas. 

According to the National Cancer Institute, more than 9,000 people will be diagnosed with it in the United States this year.

The survival rate in 1960 was about 40 percent, but advancements in medicine combined with earlier detections have increased the survival rate to more than 80 percent.

'The goal of Mr. Berry's treatment is to cure his lymphoma and we are beginning that treatment now,' Flowers said in a statement issued through the Chiefs.

Berry experienced discomfort in his chest after Kansas City's defeat by the Oakland Raiders on November 20.

A mass was found on his chest on an MRI scan, and the team announced that he would miss the rest of the season.

Kansas City Chiefs players took to the field wearing red-on-red - which Berry likes - rather than white pants

On Sunday night the Chiefs hosted Peyton Manning's Denver Broncos, their AFC West rivals, and honoured their safety.

Players wore shirts with Berry's No 29 on the back during their warm-up while a message on the big screen at Arrowhead Stadium read 'be bold, be brave, be Berry'.

The Chiefs took to the field wearing red jerseys and red trousers, a look that Berry likes, rather than their normal white trousers.

Spectators also held up banners and signs in support of the 25-year-old safety.
