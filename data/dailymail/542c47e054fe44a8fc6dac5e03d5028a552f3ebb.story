Boris Johnson said that Londoners will still be able to visit the newly opened temple in Kingsbury, London in 200 years time

Boris Johnson was pictured yesterday wearing a traditional Hindu headdress as part of a visit to a multi-million pound new temple being built in Kingsbury, London.

The Mayor of London met with religious and community leaders on a tour of the new £20 million complex, which is set to fully open in August.

Hundreds of people attended the visit where Mr Johnson was greeted by the temple’s own pipe band in traditional Scottish regalia.

During the event Mr Johnson was presented with a traditional turban by a Hindu man dressed in orange robes.

His head was wrapped with white material and he was given the ceremonial red dot mark, or tilak, on his forehead as a sign of blessing for his visit.

The Mayor 
said: ‘In 200 years time people will still be able to come and visit 
this peaceful place in Kingsbury and it will be part of the fabric of 
London.

‘People
 should realise the important role of religious voluntary organisations 
play in the communities on London. This Mandir and community centre will
 be a great asset to this whole area.’
