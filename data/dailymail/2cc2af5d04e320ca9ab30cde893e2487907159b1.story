A LUXURY five-star hotel is at the centre of a major food poisoning probe after 80 guests fell ill after a fundraising dinner.

Diners at Salford's Lowry Hotel reported fever, dizziness and vomiting after attending an event at what has been dubbed Manchester's most fashionable hotel.

The outbreak is being linked to chicken pate served at a charity dinner and is now being investigated by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) and officers from Salford council.

Investigation: The Lowry Hotel in the trendy Chapel Wharf area of Manchester

It is the first incident of its kind at the hotel since it opened 10 years ago. The Lowry, part of the Rocco Forte hotel group, was recently awarded the highest five-star hygiene rating.

Around 200 people are understood to have attended the three-course dinner to raise funds for The Message Trust youth charity.

It was discovered that some later became infected with campylobacter, a bacteria found on raw meat which can cause diarrhoea, vomiting, and stomach cramps. Symptoms can last for up to ten days.

Solicitor Alex Speed, 44, from 
Stockport, told how he fell ill after attending the event.

He
said: 'Based on what our table ate, I know that the people who had the 
tomato soup as a starter didn't get ill. It's reasonable to assume the 
pate was responsible.'

He has now 
launched a compensation claim on behalf of seven clients.

Dr Rosemary McCann, a consultant with
the HPA, said 80 guests had so far reported symptoms - and a number of 
cases of campylobacter had now been confirmed by laboratory tests.

She revealed: 'Investigations are still ongoing, including analysis of a questionnaire returned by guests.'

Hotel bosses confirmed that the pate dish had been prepared by hotel staff for the dinner on October 8.

The dish has now been taken off the menu while the investigation continues.

General manager Peter Kienast said: 'We are very sorry to hear that a number of guests fell ill following a function at our hotel.

'We are determined to get to the cause of the issue and the detailed investigation is reviewing every stage of the process from the food source itself to its delivery.

'On being informed we immediately requested our retained food safety specialist carry out a full and in-depth investigation with the Environmental Health Office which is still continuing.

'The Lowry Hotel has very stringent procedures and training methods to ensure the highest quality of hygiene in our kitchens.

'We are regularly reviewed by the Environmental Health Office and two months ago we received the highest five-star hygiene rating which we have held for a number of years. This is the first incident of its kind in The Lowry Hotel's past 10 years.

'We are in contact with the organisers of the event and assisting them with any needs they may have as the investigation continues.'

The 164-room hotel, which is on the bank of the River Irwell, was built in 2001 and quickly gained the coveted five-star status.

Cheshire businessman Roy Newey complained on Twitter that he too had been laid low for several days.

Coun Ray Mashiter, Salford council's lead member for environment, said: 'We have visited the hotel and given them advice after a resident made us aware of a possible problem.'
