A businessman who vanished for eight months has turned up again, claiming he was kidnapped and tortured by Russian gangsters and  the IRA.

Kevin McGeever had the word ‘thief’ carved into his forehead, apparently with a penknife.

An Irish property developer during the country’s economic boom, Mr McGeever, 68, claims to have been imprisoned in a cargo container for months – because he owed the criminal gangs money.

He lost five stone during his ordeal and was left with long hair, a beard and three-inch fingernails.

He was found wandering barefoot at 
night on a remote country road in Co Leitrim in the Republic of Ireland 
near the border with Ulster. He is now in hospital under armed guard.

The woman who found him said he told her that he had been thrown from a van.

Catherine Vallely said he was  ‘very well-educated, well-spoken and polite’.

She added: ‘We were told he used to be 16 and a half stone but he is just skin and bones now.’

Mrs Vallely, 64, said: ‘He had a pair
 of enormous eyes in a very thin face and his cheek-bones stuck out. He 
was rubbing his beard with fingers that had long nails.

‘When he got into the car he said he had no shoes on.

‘I said he could have been killed in 
the middle of the road, and he said three men had just thrown him out of
 a van. I thought he might have Alzheimer’s disease or something like 
that.

‘The man said his name was Kevin and he didn’t realise he was in County Leitrim.

‘He didn’t even know the month, the day or the time.’

Miss Vallely said she gave him a lift
 because, ‘there are hippy campers and a Buddhist centre in [nearby] 
Ballinamore and I sometimes pick them up.’

Mr McGeever was being treated for dehydration and malnutrition in Mullingar General Hospital.

The businessman was in such an 
unkempt state when found  – just before 10pm on Tuesday – that the 
carving on his forehead was not noticed at first.

Successful: Mr McGeever's home, 'Nirvana', in Craughwell, Galway. He is understood to have owned properties in Dubai during Ireland's boom years

Mr McGeever told police that his 
captors gave him a mobile phone when he was released and told to keep it
 with him at all times – though why is unclear.

During the boom times in Ireland – 
the era of the so-called Celtic Tiger economy from 1995 to 2007 – Mr 
McGeever sold luxury homes in Dubai to wealthy clients, including some 
from Britain.

He also owned one of Ireland’s 
biggest mansions, a £3million property which was nicknamed Nirvana by 
locals in the west of the country and is surrounded by immaculate lawns.

He drove a Porsche and travelled in a helicopter which had his initials KMM emblazoned across it.

Mr McGeever was reported missing from
 his Galway home last May by his partner Siobhán O’Callaghan. Apparently
 there was a ransom demand for his safe return.

Police last night said they were looking into ‘every aspect’ of the case and could not yet confirm any of Mr McGeever’s claims.

After he was taken to a police station, the tycoon was given a portion of curry chips.

A police spokesman said he was expected to remain in hospital.
