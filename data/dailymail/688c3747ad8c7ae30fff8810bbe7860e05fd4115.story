Police have interviewed five men in relation to an alleged gang rape which happened in a Melbourne lane on Sunday morning.

The men were interviewed by police following an appeal for information in the early morning attack, which saw a 47-year-old woman's feet bound with masking tape and raped by five men in Snowball Lane, South Yarra, in Melbourne's inner city.  

The men, three 20-year-olds from Bentleigh, a 21-year-old from Dandenong and a 19-year-old from Bentleigh, attended the police station at 9pm last night.

Police confirmed they were released pending further investigations.

Another suspect police are looking to to identify over the attack that took place in South Yarra, Melbourne

The interviews follow the release of security footage by police yesterday.

A woman, 47, was allegedly bound and raped by a group of five men in Snowball Lane, South Yarra, in Melbourne's trendy inner south at 4.15am on Sunday morning.

After the incident, the victim ran naked to nearby Chapel Street where she raised the alarm.

Chapel Street is a well-known entertainment strip in Melbourne and is considered one of the city's most exclusive suburbs.

Police described the attack as 'traumatic' for the woman, who was taken to hospital for treatments afterwards.

Detectives from the Sexual Crimes Squad are investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident and will review all CCTV footage in the area in an attempt to identify those involved. 

Detective Acting Senior Sergeant Michael Phyland said all five men sexually assaulted the woman, whose ankles were bound with masking tape during the attack.

'It's been a very traumatic occurrence for the victim,' he said.

Det Sen Sgt Phyland said some of the details of the attack were still unclear and it was too early to tell if it was planned.

'At this stage it may appear more of an opportunistic situation,' Det Sen Sgt Phyland said on Tuesday.

'She was on her own and she had been in that area,' he said.

The two men (above) police want to speak to over the attack

Investigators are appealing for anyone with information to come forward and assist them with their investigation.

They have released CCTV footage of two men they want to speak to entering a store shortly after the attack.

Asked if the woman was a sex worker, Det Sen Sgt Phyland said he would not discuss the victim's personal circumstances.

One of the men the woman was seen with was a 25-to 30-year-old Caucasian, about 175cm tall, with short blond hair, a black hoodie and dark pants.

The other was a 20 to 30-year-old man of Islander appearance, about 183cm tall, with a solid build, wearing a black shirt with white writing and a checked shirt on top of that.

Anyone with any information should contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
