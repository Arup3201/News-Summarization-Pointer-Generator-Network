Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of Premier League fixtures, as well as intriguing snippets from the Football League.

1. Brendan Rodgers tore up his belief in passing football to scrape the 1-0 over Stoke that earned Liverpool their first win in six matches. 

The Reds continually looked long to hit striker Rickie Lambert – they played just 433 passes in the 90 minutes which was 50 less than Mark Hughes side. 

Until Saturday Liverpool had averaged 545 passes per game in home Premier League games, and last season the Anfield average was 529.

2. Frank Lampard’s cameo at Southampton showed why Manuel Pellegrini is so desperate to keep him beyond the end of his current loan from New York Red Bulls which is due to end in January. 

It wasn’t just the 36-year-old’s goal – his fifth in a total of just 417 minutes of playing time since moving to Manchester City. 

Lampard also hit perfection with his passing, not once giving the ball away during his 25 minutes on the pitch.

3. Former Arsenal defender Kyle Bartley is emerging as a footballing centre half of genuine promise after taking his time to earn a first team chance at Swansea. 

The 6ft 4ins ex England Youth international who started his career at Bolton hit 73 accurate passes as Garry Monk’s side built from the back against Crystal Palace – some 18 more than the entire opposition back four put together. 

Until November Bartley, 23, had started only one Premier League game in the two years since he moved to South Wales but could now make it hard for Argentina World Cup star Federico Fernandez to win his place back when he recovers from a calf injury.

4. It’s coming up to a year since Steve Clarke was sacked by West Brom because, according to the club’s official statement, he’d won only seven league games out of the previous 34. 

Albion’s home game with Arsenal was their 34th league match since that controversial decision – and the 1-0 defeat means they have still won only seven of them. 

Getting rid of the coach who’d landed the club’s highest ever Premier League finish a few months earlier has obviously made a big difference, then.

5. Tim Sherwood may be long gone from Tottenham Hotspur but his influence remains as Mauricio Pochettino tries to sort out a side to take the club forward. 

His youth team products Harry Kane and Ryan Mason set the tone for Spurs’ hard-working win over Everton with both covering more than eight miles of running during the 90 minutes. 

Another academy product Nabil Bentaleb was fourth in Tottenham’s running stats with 7.6 miles as the side collectively outworked Everton, running an aggregate of nearly six miles more (75.5 v 69.7).

6. Midfielder Leroy Fer has added a competitive edge to QPR’s midfield and the former Norwich star is forming a combative midfield with Joey Barton and Karl Henry. 

Dutchman Fer contested 27 individual battles for the ball in the 90 minutes against Leicester and came out on top in 18 of them. That was more duels – and more successes – than any other Premier League midfielder this weekend.

7. Gus Poyet is encouraging Connor Wickham to develop his ability to run with the ball as the 21-year-old former England youth star enjoys his first season as a Premier League regular. 

Wickham attempted six dribbles against Chelsea – more than any other player from his team - from his position on the left of the attack, as well as contributing to the defensive shape of Sunderland’s battle to earn a draw against the leaders.

8. Slavisa Jokanovic was a left-field choice as Watford’s new manager – and he must fear that the club’s erratic owners the Pozzo family are already scouring their Who’s Who of European Football to choose the next one. 

The former Yugoslavia midfielder has now supervised four defeats in a row following Cardiff’s 1-0 win at Vicarage Road.

Before he was appointed as the club’s fourth boss of the season in early October the Hornets had never suffered two successive defeats.

9. Aston Villa have always considered their former youth team captain Daniel Johnson as a goal scoring midfielder and he’s finally living up to the tag after joining Oldham on loan. 

The Jamaica-born 22-year-old had never scored in senior football during loan spells at Yeovil and Chesterfield, but his two in the 3-0 win at Rochdale take him to three in as many games for Lee Johnson’s side. 

It could be worth Paul Lambert keeping an eye on him – Joe Cole’s effort at Burnley was the first scored by a midfielder since Ashley Westwood against Hull in early May.

10. Premier League rules forbid on-loan players from facing their parent club – but it isn’t like that in the Football League which was good news for Southend. 

Temporary signing John-Joe O’Toole was able to line up against Northampton just two days after leaving Sixfields and played a starring role in the Shrimpers' 2-0 win.
