In the summer Snowden was reunited in Moscow with his pole-dancer girlfriend Lindsay Mills.

The pair were pictured together on a theatre date in Moscow, where he was given political asylum by Vladimir Putin's regime. 

Snowden now has a three-year residency permit. 

Other recently released images have shown him pushing a supermarket trolley across a road and on a tourist boat on Moscow's river.

Russian channel RT have said Snowden is living 'a quiet, ordinary life in the Russian capital'.

Now he is sharing his new life with his a dog named Rick.

Snowden is wanted in the United States under the Espionage Act after leaking classified details of the U.S. government's surveillance programs.

His revelations sparked a global debate on the limits of privacy versus the needs of national security.

His critics view him as a traitor who refuses to face trial in the U.S. for his actions, while supports see him as a hero who spoke up for civil liberties. 

Snowden recently met Hollywood film director Oliver Stone, who is planning to make a film about the whistleblower starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
