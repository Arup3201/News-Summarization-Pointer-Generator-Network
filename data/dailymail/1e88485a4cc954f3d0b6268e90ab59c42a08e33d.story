Just days after his dramatic release from a Mexican jail where he had spent nearly seven months, Marine Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi sat down for an interview with Fox News to talk about the violence he had endured while in captivity.

The retired serviceman spoke exclusively to On The Record host Greta Van Susteren for a segment that will air Thursday at 7pm Eastern time.

Tahmooressi, 26, was jailed in Mexico back in March for crossing the border with loaded guns, a case that led U.S. politicians to bring intense pressure on Mexico to release him.

In his own words: Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi sat down for an interview with Fox News just days after his October 31 release

The retired serviceman spoke exclusively to On The Record host Greta Van Susteren about how he was beaten by guards in jail

He was finally freed on the night of October 31 and reunited with his mother, Jill, and then boarded a flight to Florida in San Diego.

The 26-year-old serviceman has said he took a wrong turn on a California freeway that funneled him into a Tijuana port of entry with no way to turn back, and that he had no intention of illegally bringing guns into Mexico.

After being jailed in Tijuana, he tried to kill himself by cutting his neck with a shard from a light bulb in his cell because the guards and inmates threatened to rape, torture and kill him, Tahmooressi's mother said.

Speaking to Greta Van Susteren this week, the retired Marine said that at one point during his captivity he felt a shift in the Mexican corrections officers' attitude toward him.

‘I was thinking, “Hopefully these guys would be considerate and caring and understanding”… but I started feeling the things just… something shift there.

‘They were very helpful and then it shifted, and then I knew this could be bad.’

Tahmooressi, who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, also revealed that he had been subjected to beatings, but he was unfazed by the violence.

‘It was actually joyful to take that beating. I was happy to take that beating. I knew the beating was coming,’ he recalled.

‘They [fellow inmates] were telling me stories about the guards, about how if someone acts up or does something wrong, they get beat, so already I knew it was going to happen to me, so I was glad as can be to take that beating.

Tahmooressi’s detention brought calls for his freedom from US politicians, veterans groups and social media campaigns. A US congressional committee held a hearing on the case.

In Mexico, possession of weapons restricted for use by the Army is a federal crime, and the country has been tightening up its border checks to stop the flow of US weapons that have been used by drug cartels.  

In his truck when he crossed the US-Mexico border in March, Tahmooressi was carrying a rifle, shotgun, pistol and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.

 His attorney, Fernando Benitez, argued that Tahmooressi carries loaded guns with him because his weapons, which were bought legally in the US, make him feel safer. He added that the veteran is often distracted, which could have contributed to him becoming lost. 

In his order issued last Friday, a Mexican judge did not make a determination on the illegal arms charges against Tahmooressi but freed him because of his mental state, according to a statement from Mexico's embassy in the US.
