Her striking features have graced countless top fashion magazines and Europe’s great catwalks.

Yet despite also being voted Scotland’s Most Stylish Woman recently, Amanda Hendrick has divided opinion over whether her supermodel looks are always picture perfect.

In fact, images of the 21-year-old sporting a skimpy bikini have been banned from an online clothing retailer’s catalogue after advertising watchdogs ruled Miss Hendrick looked too thin.

The Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) says the pictures on the website of Drop Dead Clothing were 'socially irresponsible' and told it to remove them.

'Too thin': Images of model Amanda Hendrick sporting this skimpy bikini have been banned from an online clothing retailer's catalogue by advertising watchdogs

The ASA acted after receiving a complaint which claimed the model 'looked anorexic' in one image of her wearing a watermelon-motif bikini and another where she sports cut-off denim shorts on the Sheffield-based company’s site.

The ban comes just weeks after Miss Hendrick, of Airdrie, Lanarkshire, won the title of Scotland’s Most Stylish Woman at the Scottish Style Awards in Glasgow.

Last night, Drop Dead Clothing, which is owned by the family of Miss Hendrick’s rock musician ex-boyfriend Oli Sykes, confirmed it had removed the offending pictures from its site.

However, the company defended the model insisting that she does not have an eating disorder and had modelled successfully for the firm for three years.

Oli’s mother, Carol Sykes, who also works for the firm, which has a shop in London, said the pictures were 'representative of young people' and pointed out that the costume Miss Hendrick is pictured wearing was a size 8.

She said: 'Amanda certainly is slim, I’m not disputing that.

'She was my son’s former girlfriend and has been a family friend for three years and had modelled for us for three years. We have never had any complaints.

'I know her, she’s not anorexic or unhealthy and eats a very good diet. She’s just a naturally thin person.

'Do I think people should aspire to be like her? Yes, because she is a beautiful person and jets around the world earning £600-plus a day. She’s got a successful career and no mental health problems.

'Do I think removing a picture of Amanda will stop people being mentally ill? No, I don’t, but I accept the decision and so does Amanda.'

The spat is the first black mark on an otherwise flawless career, which saw Miss Hendrick plucked from obscurity as a gawky 15-year-old by a talent spotter at Glasgow’s Central Station.

The former Airdrie Academy pupil was quickly snapped up by top modelling agency Storm, which launched Kate Moss’s career, after she was runner-up in the Nivea Model Search 2004 competition.

Since then, she has gone on to feature on the cover of Vogue and Elle fashion magazines, modelled for Christian Dior in the Italian fashion capital Milan, and completed a photo-shoot for Glamour magazine, wearing Cartier and Valentino.

She has also appeared at London and Paris Fashion Weeks and will be the face of Topshop’s Christmas campaign.

According to her online profile, she is 5ft 10ins with a 24-inch waist - 10in smaller than the average British woman and just an inch bigger than that of Victoria Beckham, who has sparked health fears because her 23-inch waist is the size of a typical seven-year-old child’s.

The ASA’s ruling said: 'The ASA considered the model was very slim. We also noted that in the bikini and denim shorts images, hollows in her thighs were noticeable and she had prominent thigh bones.

'We considered that in combination with the stretched out pose and heavy eye make-up, the model looked underweight in the pictures.

'While we considered the bikini and denim short images might not cause widespread or serious offence, we concluded they were socially irresponsible.'

Early in her career, the raven-haired beauty reflected on how her life had changed so dramatically from being teased by classmates about her height to becoming one of Europe's most sought-after models.

She said: 'I was a goth at school and didn't really hang around with all the popular kids.

'They used to shout things at me and called me ugly but I didn't let it bother me. I still find it hard to believe that people think that I can now be a model.

'I think it shows you can just be yourself and have an individual look. Everyone doesn't have to be the same. I just hope I can continue to be successful because modelling has given me the chance to travel and experience new places and I want to continue to do that.'

Miss Hendrick is currently represented by London-based Select Model Management and Glasgow’s Colours agency. 

Both declined to comment.
