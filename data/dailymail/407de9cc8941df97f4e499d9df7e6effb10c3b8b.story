A child molester boyfriend is apparently just one of many problems in the life of Mama June Shannon, star of the now-cancelled Here Comes Honey Boo Boo. 

Estranged husband Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson's ex-wife has come forward to claim that Mama June tried to commit suicide in early 2005, while she was pregnant with her youngest child Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson.

Sugar Bear's ex Patricia East told Star magazine that he called her frantically in early 2005, when his then wife took an overdose of pills.

'Michael Told me, "Please come over! June is trying to kill herself!"' Patricia told the magazine. 

'I wanted to do the right thing, so I went over. She was upset about something and had taken an overdose of Tylenol or Advil. We called Poison Control, and I talked to her to try and keep her awake.'

East even claims that she was still married to Sugar Bear when he began an affair with Mama June and that the reality star even suffered a miscarriage before the two officially divorced. 

Sugar Bear and East met in 2001 on an internet chat room and soon after she moved to Georgia to be with him. But the relationship seemed doomed from the onset, when he caught her with another woman on their first Valentine's Day together.

A few days after catching Sugar Bear and Mama June together, East received a particularly heartless call from her husband's then mistress. 

'She told me: My name is June Shannon, and I've been sleeping with Michael. I know he's your husband - but he's mine now!' 

East and Sugar Bear divorced in 2004, but allegedly stayed in touch for a while after the break up.

Mama June is currently under fire amid allegations she has  reunited with ex-boyfriend Mark McDaniel, the man accused of repeatedly sexually molesting her daughter Anna 'Chicakdee' Cardwell when she was eight years old. 

However, Mama June has continually denied the rumors despite disturbing photos surfacing showing her in bed with McDaniel, and touching daughter Alana's shoulder while the three were posed on a set of stairs. 

Together: Images, such as this one, have emerged showing Mama June with McDaniel. In this photograph, they are pictured with Mama June's daughter, nine-year-old Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson
