Furious David Cameron kicked EU president Herman van Rompuy out of Downing Street after clashing over Brussels jobs, Downing Street confirmed today.

The Prime Minister called a dramatic halt to talks on making Jean-Claude Juncker the new President of the European Commission.

When Mr van Rompuy refused to guarantee a vote of all 28 EU leaders, Mr Cameron declared there is ‘no point in continuing this meeting’ and showed him the door.

David Cameron welcomed the President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, on the steps of Number 10 but barely 40 minutes later he showed him the door

The two men clashed after Mr van Rompuy refused to guarantee allowing a vote on the appointment of Jean-Claude Juncker as President of the European Commission

Moments after the extraordinary snub, Mr van Rompuy left Number 10, saying nothing to waiting reporters.

The meeting was held ahead of a summit on Friday, where Mr Cameron was to argue against giving Mr Juncker the job.

With a majority of EU leaders - including Germany's Angela Merkel - throwing their weight behind Mr Juncker's candidacy, Mr Cameron was determined to force a vote on the issue.

In the end, only Hungary sided with Mr Cameron in voting against Mr Juncker’s appointment,

As chairman of the meeting, Mr van Rompuy held a key position in deciding whether the Juncker candidacy was put to a vote at all.

In the end Mr van Rompuy caved in, and allowed the vote Mr Cameron had called for during a Brussels summit on Friday

In last Monday’s meeting Mr Cameron spelt out to Mr van Rompuy why he was determined to fight the issue "until the end".

The PM said: ‘If it is to be Juncker, I insist on a formal vote.’

But according to one account, Mr van Rompuy replied: ‘I will decide how the vote is conducted.’

Mr Cameron again insisted: ‘You must guarantee there will be a proper vote.’

Mr Van Rompuy responded: ‘I have said I will decide that.’

Becoming increasingly angry, Mr Cameron raged: ‘I don’t want you saying “anyone who agrees with David raise your hands?” after I have spoken. I want a vote, and the names recorded….

‘If you won’t give me that assurance, there is no point in continuing this meeting,’ he said, according to the Mail on Sunday.

At this point Mr Cameron stood up and made clear he would not continue the talks.

In a highly unusual move, Downing Street today confirmed the row had ended the meeting earlier.

The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: ‘The meeting lasted for not quite as long as it was scheduled for.’

He added that Mr Cameron was determined to plough ahead with his demands for reform of Europe, despite his defeat on Mr Juncker.

‘The Prime Minister wanted a different outcome on Friday. We were arguing right the way through, an up until the vote, on an issue of principle.’

Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Mr Cameron today insisted he can still secure reforms to Britain's relationship with Europe.

'I am ready to move on and keep fighting for Britain's interests in Europe,' he wrote.

Only Hungary backed Mr Cameron's opposition to Mr Juncker (right) who had the backing of German Chancellor Angela Merkel

Referring to previous claims by Mr Juncker that he was ready to deliver a 'fair deal' for Britain, Mr Cameron said: 'If by a fair deal, we can agree that we are not heading, at different speeds, to the same place - as some have assumed up to now - then there is business we can do.'

Mr Cameron said his decision to stick to his word showed he meant business.

He added: 'Anyone in Europe who thought I was going to back down or blink is now thinking again.'
