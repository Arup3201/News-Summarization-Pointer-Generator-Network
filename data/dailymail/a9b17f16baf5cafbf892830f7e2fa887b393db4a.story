He was a brilliant Army surgeon who helped save the lives of hundreds of soldiers horrifically wounded on the Afghan battlefield.

Lieutenant Colonel Mike McErlain was part of a team of highly-skilled medics toiling to treat harrowing injuries in the operating theatre at Camp Bastion.

His dedication ensured young servicemen and women, including those with arms and legs blown off by roadside bombs, received a second chance.

He was so determined to help warzone amputees that he co-founded a charity run which has raised more than £100,000 for the victims.

The annual D-Day 44 Run aimed to increase awareness of the sacrifices made by Allied soldiers along the Normandy coast on June 6, 1944, and collect money for BLESMA, the British Limbless Ex-Service Men's Association.

But in a tragic twist Lt Col McErlain, a married father-of-three, collapsed and died just minutes into this year's 44-mile run.

The seemingly healthy 45-year-old had an undiagnosed degenerative heart disease.

Now his heartbroken wife Joanna has spoken for the first time about her hero - and vowed to continue organising the D-Day 44 Run in his memory.

She said: 'He was a wonderful man, husband and father and a talented surgeon. Everyone loved him. He was so humble.

'He was always as fit as a fiddle. It is such a terrible irony that he died doing that run because he loved it. He was humbled by the sacrifice of those who fell on D-Day.

'All those fallen heroes on the Normandy beaches and now there has just been another one.

'He was incredibly passionate about it. He used to say, "If it wasn't for the bravery of the people who fought at Normandy we would not be living in freedom today".

'I take some comfort in thinking that about Mike. If it were not for his work as a surgeon, a lot of people would not be here today.'

Lt Col McErlain studied medicine at the University of Aberdeen, specialising in spinal surgery. He also studied trauma surgery in Melbourne, Australia.

He joined the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) as a medical cadet in 1990 and the Parachute Regiment in 1996.

He served in Northern Ireland, Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan, where he worked at the Role 3 Hospital in Camp Bastion.

He worked in the operating theatre at the facility, widely acknowledged as the best in the world. A staggering 98 per cent of those who make it through the door still breathing do not die.

Horrendously-wounded troops' chances of surviving to recuperate at home with their families, or becoming another number on the UK's grim death toll in the war against the Taliban, rest in the hands of the 250 professional medics.

In 2011, Lt Col McErlain wrote a diary for a newspaper of his stint in Camp Bastion.

He spoke of having 'one of the hardest days of my life', when the medical staff saved the lives of three soldiers who had legs blown off by improvised explosive devices (IEDs).

'All three had what should be non-survivable injuries but we pulled them through,' he said.

Mrs McErlain, from Hindhead, Surrey, said: 'I remember saying to him "What's it like out there?" and he replied, "If you think of the worst case scenario and multiply it by 100, it's that".

‘He was so humbled by the guys who had arms and legs blown off and their determination to keep going. He never boasted about his own achievements. But helping to save so many lives was so incredible.

'You hear about guys in Afghanistan who get killed or have their limbs blown off and Mike and his team were the ones who saved them and they don't always get recognised.

'They are in the background yet without them the number of deaths would be greater.'

Lt Col McErlain worked at the Ministry of Defence Hospital Unit Frimley Park and volunteered to run clinics at Headley Court, the armed forces rehabilitation centre near Dorking, Surrey.

A keen skier and mountaineer, the surgeon also loved distance running and cycling. He ran the 156-mile Marathon des Sables through the Sahara - dubbed the toughest footrace on earth - and cycled 1,000 miles back to the United Kingdom from Bosnia in 1995.

His passion for running - and determination to raise money for BLESMA - inspired him to plot the D-Day 44 Run with brother-in-law Giles Barnes.

It is a 44-mile run through Normandy, following the cliff tops, war graves and cemeteries and ending up at Pegasus Bridge, where the Paras landed in 1944.

He was one of around 30 people who took part in the event this year. But two miles into the run, tragedy struck.

Mrs McErlain, an interior designer who was in the support car with food, drinks and medical equipment, said: 'He had been running for about two miles with a U.S. firefighter.

'He was running along the cliffs which the U.S. Rangers climbed under fire in 1944 when he suddenly collapsed. The firefighter said he tried to resuscitate him but he was unsuccessful.'

'I wonder if it happened for a reason in Normandy. He could have been in the back garden playing football but he died in a place that was special to him.

'When I found out he'd died a lady came up and put her arms around me. I was crying my eyes out and it was the daughter of General Patten.

'She spoke to me softly and said, "Mike's being lifted up by all those fallen heroes and now he's one of them. None of them had wives, mothers, daughters with them. You are weeping for all of them." It was so comforting.'

Lt Col McErlain and his wife had three children - Paris, 10, Venezia, nine, and Lucius, eight. His popularity was underlined when more than 1,000 people attended his funeral at Sandhurst Royal Military Academy.

Lieutenant Colonel AJ Day, commanding officer at the MoD Hospital Unit Frimley Park, said: 'Mike was a thoroughly professional dedicated military consultant.

'He was instrumental in pioneering new equipment and techniques for his field. Mike has left a legacy in his work contributing widely to his specialist field to benefit the Defence Medical Services.

'To die during an event he felt so passionate about is testament to his character and all he stood for. He will be greatly missed.'
