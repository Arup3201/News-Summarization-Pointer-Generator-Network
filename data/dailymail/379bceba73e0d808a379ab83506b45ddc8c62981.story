There are many different ways to drown your sorrows after not being selected to represent your nation at a home World Cup.

But Liverpool pair Phillippe Coutinho and Lucas Leiva and Man Utd's Rafael have decided to face their disappointment head on, rather than wasting time sulking, and plunge straight into Brazil's party season instead.VIDEO Scroll down for 'Coutinho humiliates defenders while playing for Vasco da Gama'

In truth, a call up for Rafael was always fairly unlikely - with Scolari preferring to take to the more experienced combination of Dani Alves and Maicon as his right-back options.

But Coutinho has every right to feel more hard done by, considering his form at Liverpool this season should have done enough to at least earn him a place in the provisional 30.

His record of five goals and seven assists in the Premier League far outstrips that of Chelsea's Willian, who managed four goals and just two assists, and Tottenham's Paulinho, who did net six times but recorded just two assists all campaign.

No matter though, World Cup or no World Cup, the trio are clearly going on enjoy their summer as much as they can.
