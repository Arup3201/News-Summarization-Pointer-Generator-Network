It's a resignation letter - but not as we know it.

Councilman and Star Trek fanatic David Waddell, who represented Indian Trail, North Carolina tendered his resignation to Mayor Michael Alvarez on Thursday with a letter written in Klingon.

Mr Waddell said that his letter was written in the alien language of the 'proud warrior race' of Klingons who feature in the sci-fi series.

It's words...but not as we know them: David Waddell's resignation letter in Klingon with the translation below

The former councilman included a translation incase the mayor was not fluent in Klingon. 

The translation read: 'Teach (the) city (the) constitution/ I will return next time to (witness) victory./ Resignation occurs in 2014 the 31st of January./Perhaps today is a good day (to) resign./David Waddell'

Mr Waddell told the Charlotte Observer: 'Folks donâ€™t know what to think of me half the time, so I might as well have one last laugh on the board.'

Mayor Alvarez responded by saying the letter was childish and unprofessional, adding it was 'an embarrassment for North Carolina'. 

The councilman is set to resign on January 31 during what was his first term on the board.

Klingons were a race of extraterrestrial warriors who featured in the Star Trek TV series and movies. As part of the show, an actual working Klingon language was devised of made-up words.  

It has a small vocabulary of around 2,000 word with the Klingon dictionary published in 1985. It has gone on to sell more than a quarter of a million copies. 

Devotees of Star Trek have set up the Klingon Language Institute which publishes multiple magazines written in the language.
