It seems humans aren't the only ones who know how to have a good time at Christmas.

Dozens of wrinkly-faced pooches partied at a festive bash organised just for pugs at the weekend, with many dressed as Santa Claus, elves and even Christmas puddings.

The pugs played together and enjoyed treats at the Christmas PugFest at ActionPetz in Cardiff - an indoor walking centre for dogs.

Merry pugmas! A Christmas party was held for pugs and their owners at ActionPetz in Cardiff and featured plenty of festive activities

Dressing up: More than 50 dog owners threw a Christmas party for their pet pugs - and some dressed them up in festive attire

Ho ho ho! These wrinkly-faced pooches got into the festive spirit in Christmassy outfits - including a reindeer, right

Dog owner Susan Reynolds, who brought her pup along to the event, said: 'I've never seen so many pugs in the same room.

'They were all having a cracking time, scampering around and getting into the festive spirit. It had to be the cutest Christmas party ever.'

The party, held over the weekend in the Welsh capital, featured a 'grand Christmas pug dog show', where owners showed off their pooches, as well as a funfair.

It was opened by PugFest's new patron, Danny Walters, who plays Tiger in the hit ITV show Benidorm, and BBC wildlife expert Dr Rhys Jones was on hand for expert advice.

Money raised by the event is going to Jemima's Place Animal trust and Cardiff Dogs home.

The event was organised by the team behind PugFest - the world's largest gathering of pugs held this summer.

Around 800 people spent the day at Court Colman Manor in Bridgend in August to celebrate the wrinkly-faced and curly-tailed pooches.

The event was set up by pug-lover Rob Clowes in memory of his nine-year-old dog Poppy - and it raised more than £1,000 for Jemima's Place Animal Trust, which provides emergency care for injured, homeless and unwanted animals. 

Speaking about the Christmas event, Robert said: 'It was a great event and I think everyone had a lot of fun.

'We decided to organise our first PugFest back in the summer in honour of my little girl pug Poppy who had recently sadly passed away.

'It was such a great success we decided to hold this Christmas event.'
