One of the air conditioner systems at a LaGuardia Airport security checkpoint has led to the first chaotic day of the summer travel season for New Yorkers after they were left in sauna-like conditions when it broke down on Monday.

The breakdown of an AC system in a portion of the New York City airport forced all of the travelers in Terminal C to use only one of the two security checkpoints.

The onslaught of extra bodies led to massive lines and overheating which was not helped by the fact that TSA workers walked off.Â 

Long lines and overheating: One of the terminals two security checkpoints was forced closed causing passengers to be huddled together in the sauna-like conditions

Several TSA officers were allowed to go home early because they felt ill due to the conditions.

'Our TSA officers are working in some adverse conditions and we are making sure that they are hydrated,' the agency said in a statement to Fox News.

'Our officers are going above and beyond to staff the checkpoints while the air conditioning system is being addressed.'

The agents, who work for the federal government, are now allowed to wear their summer uniforms in an effort to keep cool.

MyFoxNY reports that one female passenger passed out as a result of the heat.

Terminal C is owned and operated by Delta Airlines and many of their shuttle service flights to Washington D.C. and Boston are run out of those gates.

'Third World': LaGuardia Airport was the butt of a joke by Joe Biden earlier this year where he said that the Queens, New York airport was as upp to date as one from a poverty-stricken country

'Unfortunately, the air conditioning at 
Delta's LaGuardia Terminal C operation stopped working Monday morning,' 
Delta spokeswoman Morgan Durrant told Fox.

The cause is still being investigated and they suggested that the outage was 'possibly related to construction but can't confirm that with 100 percent certainty'.

'Delta regrets the uncomfortable airport experience for our customers.

MailOnline's calls to Delta about the latest conditions in the terminal were not immediately returned.

The archaic conditions at LaGuardia were the butt of a joke by vice President Joe Biden in February when he joked that it looked as if it was in a third world country and not the heart of America's biggest city.

Monday's air conditioner meltdown was not the first time in the past week that LaGuardia passengers were inconvenienced.

Two different planes had to return back to the Queens airport after a bird was sucked into their engines.
