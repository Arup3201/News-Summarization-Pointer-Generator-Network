Murderer Clifton Jeter, 37, has been sentenced to an extra 13 years in prison for trying to kill two prison officers at HMP Manchester 

A New York gangster who is serving life in a British prison for murder has had an extra 13 years tacked onto his sentence for trying to kill two prison guards with a razor blade.

Clifton Jeter, 37, shouted: 'I'm going to christen this unit in blood' before attacking Alistair Cadell and Liam Keates as they were escorting him back to his cell at HMP Manchester, formerly known as Strangeways. 

Jeter - who is in a specialist unit for violent inmates at the prison - left Mr Keates with a five inch gash to the back of his neck and another deep wound across the knee.

He also tried to sever an artery in Mr Cadell's throat with the blade - which he had managed to hide by melting into a plastic knife.

The court heard how the gangster carried out the furious attack because he felt 'restricted' and 'disrespected' by the unit's tough regime and wanted a transfer to another jail.

British-born Jeter had already been sentenced in 2008 to a 27-year life term for murdering a father-of-seven in a bungled 'honey trap' robbery. 

Today, Jeter - who was nicknamed 'Yankee' - was convicted at Manchester Crown Court of a further two charges of attempted murder.

He was jailed for 34 years which will run alongside his original sentence, of which he has 21 years left to serve.

Jeter will only become eligible for parole in 2048 when he will be aged 71. 

Passing sentence, Mr Justice David Maddison told Jeter he was 'devious and dishonest'.

He said: 'Prison officers work on a daily basis in close physical proximity to prisoners and in my view it is important that the sentences send a clear and deterrent message to any other prisoners who might attack officers.

'It is clear to me on any fair view that on your current or past offences at this stage of your life you are a very dangerous man.' 

Jeter had been taken to the US as a child but was deported back to the UK after becoming involved with some of New York's toughest street gangs. 

Bizarrely, after being jailed for murder, he set up an online profile on a prisoners' dating website asking to meet new friends.

The latest attack came two years after Jeter was accused of punching one guard and grappling with another at Frankland jail in Durham, also while being escorted to his cell.

The court heard that, in the run up to the razor blade attack, Jeter had hid the weapon under his shirt and greased his arms with baby oil or shower gel to make restraint difficult.

On the morning of the attack he told a psychologist that he wanted to 'get off' the unit but he knew an assault on a prison officer may lead to a transfer.

After being abusive in a gym saying: 'I want off this unit. It's game on. I'll f*** you all up,' he was served lunch by officers who were dressed in riot gear.

He later appeared to have calmed down and was allowed to take a shower. But although staff searched Jeter when he about to go back to his cell, they forgot to check the back of his prison shirt.

Jeter waited until one of the guards unlocked his door and then 'struck quickly and repeatedly', trying to slit Mr Cadell's throat.

After being jailed for a murder in Hendon, UK, in 2008, Jeter set up a profile to try and make friends with fellow inmates

He then cut deeply into Mr Keates' neck along almost its entire width. He then slashed his leg during a struggle on the floor, the court was told. 

CCTV footage showed officers running to help before Jeter was carried to a secure cell.

The victims' colleague Mark Carr said: 'When the door closed Jeter jumped up almost immediately and shouted, "Did you like that? His tone was high-pitched and mocking".'

Another prison officer, David Massey, added: 'He was quite elated. He was looking to incite us, to say, "Look what I have done, I have wounded two of your officers".'

A later search of the shower area revealed a 'void in the wall' behind a loose sheet of plastic where the weapon could have been hidden. 

Both Mr Cadell and Mr Keates were off work for six weeks and have been diagnosed with anxiety and each are in fear of being attacked again. 

The attack took place at HMP Manchester, formerly known as Strangeways, while the two guards were escorting Jeter back to his cell 

Both men were later treated in hospital with Mr Keates requiring stitches for his wounds. 

Jeter later claimed a 'culture of racism' existed at the jail and claimed he had joined a prison gang named 'The Piranhas' which targeted Muslim inmates.

He said staff had wanted him to take part in a plot to attack a convicted Islamic terrorist and carried out a 'pre-emptive' strike against the guards when he refused. 

In 2002, Jeter was jailed for seven years in the UK for aggravated burglary after raiding a hotel room and holding a man at gunpoint.

It was in 2007 that he was arrested for murder. The gangster's girlfriend - known as Candy - had unexpectedly turned up at the victim's home in Hendon for a sexual liaison. 

Sentencing, Justice David Maddison told Jeter: 'It is important that the sentences send a clear and deterrent message to any other prisoners who might attack officers' (file pic)

Chauffeur Ghiass Tarabin was then stabbed to death after Jeter burst in, demanding cash and valuables.

In the struggle that followed Tarabin, 49, was stabbed once in the chest and collapsed in his garden. He died minutes later from massive blood loss.

Jeter was convicted of murder in May 2008 at the Old Bailey and jailed for life but was moved around various jails due to his violent behaviour.

After being jailed, he tried to reach out to others through his online profile, explaining: 'Prison can be a lonely place. It's also hard to make friends in here.

'I miss being able to socialize and mingle. I'm a laid back guy. I love to have stimulating conversations.'
