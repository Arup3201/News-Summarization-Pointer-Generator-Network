Scottish prison chiefs launched an investigation into Facebook messages suggesting drugs were being smuggled into jail for a former model who was serving life for killing her boyfriend.

Caroline Igoe, 34, was jailed in 2010 for murdering her boyfriend, Martyn Barclay, with his own gun.

The probe, launched in January after prison authorities were handed copies of the online messages, was into concerns that drugs and a phone could have been smuggled into HMP Edinburgh for the mother-of-four.

The inquiry has already concluded and it is understood officers found no evidence that contraband had been brought into the prison.

The social media exchange was reportedly between two of Igoe's associates. Prisoners themselves have no access to the internet and there is no indication the killer had any involvement in the conversation.

One message referred to the smuggling of 'subys' - a slang name for suboxone, which is used to help heroin users through withdrawal.

In another, it was claimed a mobile phone had been taken into the jail for Igoe to use.

In the Facebook exchange, a woman claimed she was going to jail for a 'little remand' and allegedly offered to smuggle drugs inside for the killer.

It suggested she was 'taking a phone in' for Igoe and any drugs she could source.

One message said: 'I’m no wanting to go in wae oot drugs for em (sic).'

The woman said it was 'short notice' but added that 'anything at all you can put together for her' she would attempt to smuggle in.

She added: 'Every little helps in there.'

Scottish Prison Service said they do not comment on individual cases.

Martyn Barclay, 26, was found dying in the street outside Igoe’s home in Inch, Edinburgh, in January 2009.

Sentencing her, Lord Bracadale said: 'Martyn Barclay was your boyfriend and very unwisely kept a handgun. That does not mean he deserved to be shot by it.

'You shot him in a public street in the morning. Just why you did that is not clear, but you have left his family bereft.'

Her brother Paul was cleared of murder but jailed for six years for trying to cover up the crime by removing and disposing of the gun.

Igoe had previous convictions for malicious damage and dishonesty.

It was said in court Igoe and Barclay had fought over money just hours before she shot him with his 9mm pistol. Minutes after the murder she was browsing online modelling photos of herself.
