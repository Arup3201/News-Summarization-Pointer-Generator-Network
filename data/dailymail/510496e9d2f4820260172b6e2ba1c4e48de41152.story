Tragedy: Flight Lieutenant Sean Cunningham died when his ejector seat unexpectedly fired as he and colleagues prepared their jets to fly

An RAF engineer who witnessed his pilot friend die after his ejector seat unexpectedly fired gave an emotional description of the tragedy to an inquest today.

Corporal David Morris watched as Flight Lieutenant Sean Cunningham of the Red Arrows was propelled into the air from his parked Hawk T1 aircraft at RAF Scampton, Lincolnshire.

The highly-regarded and experienced pilot with the aerial display team, who was also an Iraq war veteran, was fatally injured when he hit the ground.

The parachute on the ejector seat did not deploy and the 35-year-old South African-born airman died in hospital after suffering multiple injuries.

Corporal Morris, a Survival Equipment Fitter with the RAF, told the inquest that on November 8, 2011, he was not far from Flight Lieutenant Cunningham’s jet as the team prepared to fly to RAF Valley in Wales.

Ground crew had been carrying out pre-flight checks, as had the pilots in their cockpits, when he became aware that something had gone wrong for Flight Lieutenant Cunningham.

'The canopy filled with smoke and Flight Lieutenant Cunningham went from his seat through the canopy,' he said.

Shaken by the memory of the tragedy, Corporal Morris was forced to pause to compose himself before he continued recalling the events of the day.

He said he was standing with a colleague when the canopy blew, scattering pieces of perspex across the ground which they had to duck to avoid, and it took a few seconds to realise what had happened.

He told the inquest he had to watch the trajectory of the ejection seat through the air because he was aware it should separate from the ejected pilot and it was unclear where they would land.

However, the inquest heard that the seat did not come away from Flight Lieutenant Cunningham who remained attached to the seat until he hit the ground.

Corporal Morris said: 'I watched it from start to finish and when I saw the drogue deploy the seat stabilised but from where I was standing it looked like Flight Lieutenant Cunningham was trying to stabilise himself.

'I could see his limbs moving and then the seat seemed to come to some sort of position where it was falling properly and that’s when I thought it would separate from Flight Lieutenant Cunningham.

'He came down almost in slow motion, but obviously fairly quickly, and hit the floor. I could hear and feel the thud beneath our feet.'

Colleagues rushed to Flight Lieutenant Cunningham’s side but Corporal Morris said it was obvious he was terribly injured. 'I knew it was bad,' he told the inquest.

Asked by Richard Seabrook, counsel to the inquest, if he saw any signs of life, Corporal Morris paused to take a deep breath before answering: 'No.'

He told the inquest he had been quite close to the pilot and the morning of the incident had shared some banter, in which Flight Lieutenant Cunningham had put his arm around him.

Corporal Morris's account came on the day that the inquest in Lincoln heard from the Red Arrows' squadron leader, who admitted he had been left shocked at the team's lack of resources on returning from time away.

Squadron Leader Martin Higgins said in a pre-written statement to the hearing: 'The big change I have seen, having left the team for four years, is that resources is now a big issue, and the ability to do the task.

'It’s a big ask on the boys downstairs.'

Giving evidence to the inquest, Squadron Leader Higgins said he was talking about the engineers, who understood and wanted to do their job but needed some extra help to do so.

'They need some reassurance that help is on the way.'

Admitting that his unit's jets 'were not getting any younger' Squadron Leader Higgins also lamented that there was little opportunity for the engineers to get their hands on the planes.

Senior Aircraftman Joseph Tiley, an aircraft maintenance mechanic for Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team (RAFAT), told the inquest that on the morning of November 8 he carried out checks on Flight Lieutenant Cunningham’s aircraft before signing it over to the pilot for flight.

He said part of his inspection was to examine the cockpit to make sure there were no problems.

This included a visual check for safety pins in the seat, which pilots must pull out as they prepare for take-off to allow a seat firing handle to activate in case of emergency.

Yesterday the inquest heard that, to trigger the seat, pilots must then pull the handle, which is located on the seat between their legs, upwards.

Evidence given to the hearing said there had been occasions when air crew were unaware that the safety pin had been mistakenly inserted incorrectly and the firing mechanism became live.

The inquest also heard that the safety handle could be locked in a certain position where a downward pressure would cause the ejection seat to launch.

SAC Tiley said he would always check safety pins in the seat. This was usually done visually, both to ensure his own safety while carrying out cockpit inspections and that of the pilot he was handing over to.

On the morning of the day of Flight Lieutenant Cunningham’s death, he carried out these checks as usual, he told the inquest.

He was with the pilot when he strapped into the cockpit and did not notice anything untoward, with the only slightly unusual thing being a 'slight delay' in the canopy closing.

SAC Tiley went on with his normal checks as the jets prepared to fly, and told the inquest: 'As I passed the nose and took a quick glance to my left, I did notice that his pins were not in stowage at that point, but I focused on doing my look-round checks on the aircraft.'

He said that by the time he had finished his checks, a colleague was close to Flight Lieutenant Cunningham’s plane and he thought had reminded him about the pins, which the inquest has heard it was not uncommon for pilots to occasionally forget about.

SAC Tiley did not see the ejection.

'I was about to take a step back to do the air brake when I saw a flash of black smoke and at that point I tucked myself into a ball, put my hands over my head, and closed my eyes,' he said.

SAC Tiley told the inquest he had not been aware that if a safety pin was in the seat it could be unsafe.

He said: 'At the time, if the pin was in, in my opinion, that should have meant it was through the housing and it should not have been possible for the other positions.

'To me, an ejector seat should have two settings - safe or in use. It should not have these dead spots.'

The inquest, which is expected to last up to three weeks and is attended by members of Flight Lieutenant Cunningham’s family, continues.
