The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are to spend Christmas at the Middleton family home.

Prince William will join Kate Middleton's family at their house in Bucklebury, Berkshire, Clarence House announced today.

Speculation had been mounting in recent days over whether Kate would join the Royal Family for their annual Christmas festivities at Sandringham.

The Royal engagement would prove a much more stressful engagement for the Duchess, who is still recovering from a bout of severe morning sickness.

The Duke and Duchess spent the last festive period at Sandringham and despite opting out of  Christmas day at the formal gathering this year, the couple will visit the Norfolk estate at some stage.

Hundreds of well-wishers 
turned out to see the Duchess of Cambridge attend her first Christmas 
Day service at church in Sandringham last year.

But the Duke of Edinburgh missed the celebrations and instead spent four
days at Papworth Hospital in Cambridgeshire following a procedure to 
clear a blocked artery.

The couple's decision to join Kate's parents Carol and Michael has been taken with the approval of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh.

They are expected to be joined at the festivities by Kate's siblings Pippa and James.

Prince William will also get a humourous insight into what life in the Middleton household is like on Christmas day, after it was revealed that Michael Middleton likes to wear fancy dress on the day.

Writing in a magazine earlier this year, she said: 'He buys a new costume each year and 
typically gets a bit carried away - a couple of Christmases ago, he 
appeared in an inflatable sumo outfit.'

Pippa also said that Christmas in 
Bucklebury was likely to be 'blissfully calm' and added: 'Home is, 
happily, where I'll be this year.'

She also said that the family was 'good at keeping each other's spirits up' over the festive period.'

One person who won't be joining any 
festivities this year is Prince Harry, who is serving as an Apache 
helicopter pilot in Camp Bastion, Afghanistan.

Harry, however, is expected to engage
in some Christmas cheer, with reports suggesting that he will help 
serve Christmasa dinner to hundreds of junior soldier stationed at the 
base.

The past month has been a tubulent 
one for the Duchess of Cambridge after her preganancy was announced to 
the world as she was admitted to hospital suffering from sever morning 
sickness.

Kate left King Edward VII's Hospital 
in London on December 6 after spending three days being treated for 
hyperemesis gravidarum, which leaves expectant mothers so ill they 
cannot keep food or liquids down.

She was then ordered by doctors to 
have a period of rest at her home at Kensington Palace which meant she 
was forced to cancel appearances at a number of engagements.

Kate made her first public appearance last week, presenting an award at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year event.

She may need to take medication for the vomiting condition for several months to come.

Earlier this month, Kate looked tired and pale but still managed a broad grin as she left hospital following treatment for her acute morning sickness and said to wellwishers: ‘I’m feeling much better, thank you.’

Grandfather-to-be Prince Charles was equally delighted as he spoke about his son’s happy news.

‘I’m thrilled, marvellous. A very nice thought of grandfatherhood at my old age, if I may say so. So that’s splendid. And I’m very glad my daughter-in-law is getting better, thank goodness,’ he said.
