A million-dollar, five bedroom mansion has been successfully transplanted 14 miles from Fargo to Horace in North Dakota.

Moving the 4,500-square-foot, 218-tonne home required four moving companies, a 23-axel truck, a slew of permits and help from dozens of people including police officers and electricians.

New owner Scott Adelman bought the property at a knockdown price of just $70,000 because the land it was built on was being turned into a flood diversion.

'It's quite the project to just get it moved,' new owner Scott Adelman told KVLY.

He said the most challenging part of the process has been securing all the permits required, especially because he wanted to take the property across the interstate bridge.

That required the Department of Transportation as well as the city of Fargo, Stanley Township, and Horace. He also had to coordinate with other contractors including sign companies, street light companies and power companies. 

It took two days to move the house as it crawled along the interstate at speeds of about 5 mph. 

Now that it has reached its destination, Adelman has a crew of 15 people ready to rebuild the property so he can have it back on the market in just five weeks. 

'We will have to put the foundation underneath it and piece it back together,' said Adelman. 'It's a project, but the majority of the house obviously, stays intact.'

He estimates that it will take a week for the concrete to set and then the house will be set on top. Then the plumbing and electric will next to set up before a new family can move in.

Adelman, who owns a company that specializes in relocating and 'recycling' homes, intends to list the property at around $700,000.
