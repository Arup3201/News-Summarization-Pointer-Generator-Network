Japan has asked for a boat back that has washed up in America following the massive 2011 tsunami.

Officials from the Japanese city of Rikuzentakata said it is in a 'giddy state of shock' and would love to get the boat back now it has been found in northern California.

The 20ft boat was been discovered in the town of Crescent City, midway between the cities of San Francisco and Portland.

The boat had travelled a distance of some 5,500 miles.

The Japanese found out where the boat was after officials in the U.S. posted a picture on Crescent City’s Facebook page.

Just hours later, a teacher from a school in Japan, said the boat was their's.

Humboldt State University geologist Lori Dengler says she posted the photos recently after a university librarian translated the name of the high school from the boat.

The earthquake and tsunami which struck Japan in 2011 was the most powerful in the country’s history, and killed more than 16,000 people.

When the deadly tsunami struck Japan 
in March 2011, about five million tons of debris was dragged into the 
Pacific Ocean, according to Japanese government estimates.

In March 2011, the tsunami flooded over the breakwater protecting the coastal city of Miyako at Heigawa estuary

Most of the flotsam and jetsam later sunk to the bottom, but about 1.5 tons of debris continued floating across the ocean.

Some
of tsunami remnants found their way to American shores, including two 
docks that made landfall in Washington and Oregon. But the only living 
organisms that were discovered on the docks included plant life and 
invertebrate like limpets and barnacles.

Last June, a 70ft dock landed on a
beach north of Newport. It was determined to be one of four docks that 
broke loose from the Port of Misawa on Honshu, Japan, the station KOIN reported.

In December 2012, a second Japanese dock drifted ashore on the Olympic Peninsula in northwestern Washington.

Prior
to the discovery of the fish on the skiff, scientists believed that no 
species could survive a long journey across the ocean, and that only 
large objects, like docks, could support life.
