It appears LG is hot on the heels of rival Samsung and is gearing up to launch its own curved smartphone, according to leaked photographs.

Technology site Engadget claims to have obtained three rendered images of what is believed to be LG's rumoured G Flex phone set to launch as early as next month.

The overall design of the phone is shown, cast in shadows, and the handset curves from top to bottom - unlike Samsung's Galaxy Round that curves from left to right.

There's been a bit of a merry-go-round between the two Korean phone makers in recent months; as soon as one announces an advancement in flexible technology, the other follows suit shortly after.

The two firms were the first in the world to sell curved OLED TV screens, for example.

Samsung announced earlier this year it was working on flexible smartphone technology before LG claimed it had completed work on its own flexible 6-inch plastic screen at the start of last week.

Just a day later, Samsung unveiled its Galaxy Round handset in Korea.

Samsung claimed its Galaxy Round 
handset was curved on the horizontal because this makes it easier to 
hold in the palm of a hand. However, LG's G Flex appears to curve on the
 vertical which goes against Samsung's claims - so what is the point of 
the technology?

Following the Galaxy Round announcement last week, Android expert Kellex from Droid Life said: 'This is a Galaxy Note 3 with a curved display and a couple of extra gimmicky 
features. We still aren’t seeing a point.'

Dave Evans, Chief Technology Officer at Somo said: 'Some might be calling this a gimmick, but we think this is an interim 
step toward ‘truly’ flexible screens that would revolutionise the 
current form factors of mobile.

'Some people thought touchscreen phones 
were a gimmick and would never catch on. Seven years later I think it’s 
fair to say those people have been proved wrong.'

Stephen Ebbett, global director of gadget insurer Protect Your Bubble, similarly disagrees and told MailOnline: 'While flexible screens haven't been lauded as an aesthetic marvel, they're no design gimmick.

'Almost
 a third of mobile claims we process are for accidental damage - mainly 
cracked screens from people dropping or sitting on them. If unbreakable,
 bendable screens gain popularity, it would solve that problem 
overnight.'

Will Findlater, Global online editor for Stuff Magazine
 added: 'Looking further on, the roll-up tablet would have obvious 
benefits for portability - it could be like carrying a real newspaper 
instead of a solid rectangle all over again - and there could be new, 
intuitive user interfaces introduced, as we've already seen with Plastic
 Logic's Papertab and its ability to swap between pages when its corners
 are bent slightly upwards.

'There's even talk of gadgets that can adapt their physical dimensions based on what you're using them for.'

David Quin, Head of Consumer Applications at CoPilot told MailOnline: 'There’s hint of ‘we’ve launched it because we can’ about some of the new curved smartphones announced recently, however it’s really just the beginning.

In the near future screens will become thinner and won’t need to be flat like they are today, making them better suited for certain tasks. A curved screen could help reduce glare in direct sunlight for example.

'Designers will be able to embed technology in a more subtle, natural way: both more attractive and comfortable to use - think of a curved sat nav display embedded seamlessly within the sweep of your car’s dashboard or a status display on fridge fascia.

'There’s great possibilities for wearable technology too of course, for example curved smart watches or a tablet computer that can roll-up and even fold into your pocket.

'The challenge will be to introduce flexible technology in way that’s actually useful to people, not simply as a marketing gimmick.'

Rob Hodges at e2save continued: 'Provided the Galaxy Round proves to be robust in South Korea, we could see round displays roll out on more smartphones and wearable tech over the next 2-3 years.'

Paul Briden, Reviews Editor from Know Your Mobile told MailOnline: 'Phones with curved glass displays have been released before. That particular model sold well, but it wasn’t because it had a curved display it was because it was an all-round good phone with Google’s official stamp on it and one of the few at the time running stock Android.

'The difference this time is this new technology, the flexible OLED component, which is specifically the substrate underneath the glass and which actually produces the picture you see.

'The technology is significant because it is unbreakable, unlike the older glass substrate, and in the future the flexible nature potentially allows for more inventive phone designs with things like wrap-around displays.

'It’s worth pointing out though that there’s still a layer of glass on top, which is still breakable, so for users worried about cracking their screen the change isn’t quite as significant just yet, though this is likely to change in the future.'

The Galaxy Round curves from left to right and is only currently available in the company's home region.

LG
 is set to launch its own curved phone next month - although some 
experts claim it won't be ready until the start of next year.

LG's 6-inch display is made of bendy plastic substrates, rather than 
glass, and the panel can be attached to any curved device.

Samsung's Galaxy Round handset, pictured, curves from left to right. The company claims this makes it more comfortable to hold than other phones

This image shows the alleged LG G Flex phone from a side angle. It appears to curve from top to bottom, unlike Samsung's Galaxy Round, but it is thinner than its rival's device

The design is 0.44mm thick and has a protective film attached to the back, making it 'bendable and unbreakable.'

It is vertically concave from top to bottom, has a radius of 7cm and weighs 7.2g.

LG
 Chem, the South Koren firm's research arm, additionally said it was ready to unveil a curved battery prototype ahead of any new handset launch.

LG Display's technology could also be fitted to smart watches, and other devices, that can be wrapped around items, pictured

Although the handset isn't expected 
to be bendy, the use of a flexible screen could mean it has a more 
curved display than current phones.

Samsung's
 Nexus S and Galaxy Nexus phones have slightly curved, OLED screens, but
 they both use curved glass, not flexible plastic.

LG Display claims the flexible OLED panel is the 'world's slimmest among 
existing mobile device panels.'

The company's new battery technology could also revolutionise smartphones because it is so bendy it can be tied in knots.

It
 could even improve the battery life of phones because manufacturers 
could add more power into the batteries, if they're not restricted by 
size or shape.

LG Chem's cable-type lithium-ion battery can even woven into textiles.

This means the technology could also be fitted to clothes, and users could end up 'wearing' phone chargers.
