London was today named the world’s most expensive city for super-prime housing with wealthy homeowners paying a staggering £6,000 per sq ft.

The capital has always been a safe haven for the foreign elite looking to make a top-end housing purchase.

And its popularity continues to rise, according to a report from property advisers CBRE.

While house prices are falling in most regions, around 100 property millionares were created every day in the capital. Pictured is Rutland Gate, in Knightsbridge, London that was on the market for £300million

The average price for a super prime home is £6,000 per sq ft - well ahead of Hong Kong (£5,500), Sydney (£4,380), New York (£5,300) and Paris (£2,900).]

CBRE says the super prime market is limited to a sphere of ‘golden postcodes’ predominantly around Knightsbridge, Kensington and Chelsea.

Trevor Abrahmsohn, who runs upmarket Glentree Estates, has sold some of London’s most expensive homes over the past 35 years with wealthy foreigners among his biggest clients.

He puts this down to London being the 'best city in the world' thanks to a combination of its position, history and all-round facilities.

Mr Abrahmsohn said: 'London ticks all the boxes for the family and is politically and economically stable.

'It is a free-spinning, 24-hour city. It is electric, eclectic, fun and serious and has culture and heritage.

'In the US you’ll find business is in New York and entertainment is in Los Angeles. With the UK, all of the centres of excellence are in London.'

Prime central London house prices have risen 49 per cent since March 2009 and are 14 per cent higher than their previous market peak of March 2008.

London continues to draw in Russian billionaires with many spending well in excess of £10million.

India’s wealthy residents also look to London for super prime property - making up 25 per cent of the Mayfair population.

There is increased activity from Dubai, UAE and Saudi Arabia, although money for these deals will have often originated from countries such as Syria or Bahrain.

Mark Collins, head of residential at CBRE, said: 'Global economic uncertainty is fuelling the success of London’s super prime property market, as investors look to spread risk by diversifying their portfolios.

'London is very much the port in the storm, as wealthy investors around the world appreciate the capital's stability when compared with other markets.

'In addition to overseas funding, London’s super prime market continues to be buoyed by strong domestic investment.'
