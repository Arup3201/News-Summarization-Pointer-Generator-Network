Liverpool are leading the chase to sign £30million-rated Cesc Fabregas who is determined to return to England after Barcelona made it clear they are willing to sell him.

The relatively low fee for the 27-year-old midfielder, who was confirmed as part of Spain’s World Cup squad on Saturday, will tempt several Premier League clubs, but the Anfield side have a real chance of signing him because they are in the Champions League next season.

Fabregas’s availability will also test the willingness of Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, who has a £100million transfer kitty, to return for his former captain.

Admiration: Brendan Rodgers wants to bring Fabregas to Liverpool next season

But Arsenal are poised to make a move 
from Sven Bender, the  25-year-old Borussia Dortmund mid-fielder and 
with Mesut Ozil and Santi Cazorla already in the usual Fabregas role, 
the Gunners are likely to strengthen with a more defensive midfield 
player.

Arsenal have 
previously been interested in Bender’s twin brother, Lars, and bid £18m 
for him last summer, only to be turned down by Bayer Leverkusen.

Lars
 has since signed a new contract and is currently injured but Arsenal 
hope they can lure Sven from Dortmund with a £15m bid after he failed to
 make the  Germany World Cup squad.

Wenger
 had not previously ruled out the return of Fabregas to the club, having
 maintained a good relationship with his former captain despite the fact
 that some supporters were unhappy with the manner in which he left in 
2011.

Change of direction: Wenger is believed to be looking at other targets such as Sven Bender

Surplus: New Barcelona head coach Luis Enrique has told Fabregas he can find another club this summer

However, Manchester City and Chelsea are also likely to be attracted by the fact that Fabregas is available.

Brendan
 Rodgers’s ambitious  Liverpool have already signed Rickie Lambert from 
Southampton and are still chasing his team-mates Dejan Lovren and Adam 
Lallana. They have also shown an interest in Sevilla full-back Alberto 
Moreno.

Arsenal had a clause
 inserted in the contract when Fabregas left for £35m stating that 
Barcelona have to inform them if he is sold so that Arsenal could match 
any offer.

The Londoners 
would also share in any possible profit that Barcelona make over and 
above the fee of £35m that they received when he was transferred.

Barcelona, under new coach Luis Enrique, are making a move for Atletico Madrid midfield Koke, who may cost up to £48m.
