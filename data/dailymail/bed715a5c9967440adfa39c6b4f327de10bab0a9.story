A TV news station was flooded with complaints during an afternoon broadcast after showing male genitals behind the show’s anchor.

Ceskatelevize - one of the Czech Republic’s main broadcasters - started its 4pm broadcast with presenter Daniel Takac apparently unaware of the blunder.

But newsroom journalists can be seen laughing in the background before the phallus is replaced by a picture of a green vegetable.

Shocking: A TV news station was flooded with complaints during an afternoon broadcast after showing a male's genitals on a monitor behind the show's anchor

A spokesman for the channel said: 'The image was actually part of a documentary, but we should have been aware of timing and not had that particular scene playing when we went on air.

'It was a silly mistake.'

That may not impress regulators however who say that such images are banned on day time TV and warn that the broadcaster may face a severe fine once the investigation is complete.

In August the BBC was forced to apologise after 
broadcasting a picture of Prince William with a doodle of comedy 
glasses, a moustache and a penis drawn on his head.

The
unusual picture of the Duke of Cambridge was broadcast as part of a 
trailer used on BBC Breakfast for a feature on musical theatre group 
Barbershopera.

The clip, was taken from the group's comedy song I Could Have Married Kate.

The BBC  apologised and said that editors failed to spot the offending picture.

But live TV can be a cruel mistress as reporter Siobhan Riley found out after she unwittingly drew a shape resembling a large penis on a Tuesday evening bulletin.

The unfortunate – if hilarious - incident happened during a live news report on ABC12 which covers the mid-Michigan area.

Riley was using an onscreen map to show viewers an area in the center of Saginaw blighted by construction work when she drew the undeniably phallic shape.

The clip of Riley’s dodgy drawing quickly went viral.

Tipping point? Neither Riley nor the TV station have commented on the incident
