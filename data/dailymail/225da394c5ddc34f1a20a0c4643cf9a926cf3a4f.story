Friends looked with envy at the string of ‘wish you were here’ cards sent by Ashley Beaumont and his girlfriend from exotic locations around the world.

But the couple’s travelling days are over after it was discovered that Beaumont was funding their lavish lifestyle by dealing cocaine – which made him an astonishing £84,000 a month, or £1million a year.

Their secret was only found out when travel agents became suspicious that Beaumont, who is also a cage fighter, paid for their expensive trips in cash.

Ashley Beaumont, 25, who was exposed as a cocaine dealer, after he and his fiancee Chelsea Barnes, 22 paid for their lavish holidays in cash

 The couple spent almost £15,000 earned from drug dealing on a string of sunshine breaks around the Mediterranean and Caribbean

The former cage fighter was yesterday jailed for more than 10 years while his fiancee, who met him while working as a ring-girl, was given a 12-month suspended sentence for money laundering

The 25-year-old and five of his drug-dealing gang’s members have now been sentenced to a total of 46 years behind bars.

Beaumont had recruited old school friends to flood South Wales with cocaine, Cardiff Crown Court heard.

Documents found at Beaumont’s home showed that the gang, which had dealt the Class A drug for four and a half years before it was uncovered by a police investigation, had at least 50 regular buyers in the area, prosecutor Ieuan Bennett said. 

And Beaumont’s drugs empire made more than £20,000 a week, which he used to fund the holidays, as well as flash cars and designer clothes. 

Beaumont's second in command Marcus Purchase, 25, of Pontypool, (left) was given seven years and four months. And Dean McCann, 24, (right) of Newport, was given 10 years for the cocaine conspiracy, possessing mephedrone and for a burglary

Thomas Filer (left), 23, of Abersychan, and Adam Barker (right), 24, of Pontypool, were given five years for lesser crimes 

He also had a fearsome record as a fighter and once knocked out an opponent with a punch in just 18 seconds.

Beaumont and his 22-year-old girlfriend Chelsea Barnes, a ‘ring girl’ whom he met when she was hired to parade around the cage between fights, enjoyed breaks around the Mediterranean and the Caribbean totalling £14,777.

Christopher Evans, 31, of Henllys, was sentenced to seven years and six months

Ringleader Beaumont, from Pontypool in south-east Wales, was given the longest jail sentence of ten years and eight months.

Judge Neil Bidder QC told him: ‘You were the organiser, made the greatest profit and continued over a period of time.’ Judge Bidder added yesterday: ‘Trafficking Class A drugs causes degradation, misery and often death.

‘It’s an evil trade in which easy profit can be made and drugs lie at the root of most crime in Wales. Deterrent sentences are necessary for those who involve themselves.’

Mother-of-one Barnes, also from Pontypool, admitted money-laundering and was given a 12-month suspended sentence.

Five other members of the gang were given prison sentences after pleading guilty to conspiring to supply Class A drugs.

Gwent Police welcomed the sentences at the end of what they said was a ‘long and protracted investigation’.

A spokesman added: ‘Whole communities have been saved from suffering and the sentences should be a warning to others.’
