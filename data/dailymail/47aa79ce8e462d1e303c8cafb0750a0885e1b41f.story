A seven-year-old boy suffered a deep wound above his eye after he was mauled by a Staffordshire Bull Terrier cross he was trying to cuddle.

McKinley Worthington was bitten by the dog during a family day out at a pub near his home in Bolton, Greater Manchester last April.

CCTV footage shown to Bolton Magistrates' Court shows the schoolboy being licked by the landlady's dog before it turns and bites him as he leans in for a cuddle.

The dog's owner, Margaret Wilson, who runs the Oddfellows Arms in Bolton, Greater Manchester was convicted of having a dog dangerously out of control last week.

She was fined £200 and ordered to pay £520 in costs, but her dog, named Caine, will not be destroyed. Instead it must wear a muzzle in public places and in the pub area at all times. 

McKinley's mother, Sammi-Jo Gledhill, said after the hearing that her son started screaming 'I am going to die' as blood poured from the wound above his eye.

He was taken to hospital where he was given eight stitches - leaving him with a scar above his eye.

McKinley is now petrified of dogs and tells his mother he looks 'ugly' because of the scarring. He also refuses to leave the house without his cap on. 

McKinley and his three-year-old sister, Maisie, had been taken to the pub with their mother and father, where the dog, a Rhodesian Ridgeback cross, was allowed to walk around freely.

Footage taken from a security camera shows McKinley on his knees trying to get the dog to play with him at around 7pm - seven hours after the family arrived at the pub.

Initially the dog is seen licking McKinley's face, but then bites the schoolboy when he leaned in for a cuddle. 

Witness Trevor Oliphant said: 'When the little lad came in the dog went to his bed. The wee lad went to follow him and I said "I think he is tired". It appeared the dog didn't want to play with him.'

Wilson denied wrongdoing claiming the boy's injuries were caused accidentally.

She said her dog had always been allowed downstairs in the pub and had never had a problem with the animal previously.

She said she was aware of Miss Gledhill and her children in the pub but 'hadn't felt the need' to take Caine upstairs and 'had no worries about him at all'. 

She told police that she had earlier told the boy to stop bothering the dog who was 'always downstairs just trotting around, lying down'.

She added: 'I allow children in my pub because I have six children of my own and 15 grandchildren. I have always said that other children can come in if they are supervised.

'I have had Christmas and Halloween parties in my pub with 20-plus children with no problem. As an animal he is very laid back. He gets bullied by my cat. 

'As a general rule if people say "I'm not playing" he goes away. Mckinley did go up to him a few times. I had asked him to leave the dog alone - he is not a toy.'

But Miss Gledhill, who has since been barred from the pub, told the court: 'I had seen McKinley go up to the dog a few times but it doesn't give the dog the right to bite my son.

'There was a big gash to McKinley's eye and around dogs now he is petrified. When he sees his scar he says he looks ugly. He won't leave the house without a cap on. '

After the hearing she added: 'When it happened at first, I thought a pool ball had hit him in his face. It was all a blur but I wasn't drinking. 

'The kids were always within eyesight as the pub is open and their dad was there and all our friends. There are loads of kids there.

'When it happened Mckinley kept saying "I'm going to die, I'm going to die". He was braver than I would have been. 

'Skin was hanging down and I could see lots of white bits which I guess was his tissue. He was screaming.

'I tried to clean him up and then the ambulance said to put a dry towel on it. In the ambulance I was in shock. He was just covered in blood.

'In hospital the doctor said that if the dog had bitten him a couple of millimetres lower, McKinley could have been blinded. 

'He was very lucky. It's heartbreaking when he says he is ugly because of the scars. I feel like crying.

'After it happened we had to get rid of our Jack Russell Rex who was a puppy we'd got at Christmas because McKinley was petrified of dogs. 

'Now he is very conscious of his face and he says that his scar can itch and hurt. When I saw the CCTV of the incident I started crying.

'I do understand it is her pet but you don't know with dogs - they can just turn. Another kid could bend down and it could react the same. It could have happened to any kid.'  

Father Aaron, 32, said: 'I know it's a pub but it's a family pub and there's always lots of kids in there - and I want the dog to be destroyed for what it did to my son. '
