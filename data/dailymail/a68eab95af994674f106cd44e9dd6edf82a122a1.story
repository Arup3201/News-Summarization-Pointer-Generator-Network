Spilling secrets: Former CIA Acting General Counsel John Rizzo wrote a book about his 33 years at the agency

A new book by one of the CIA’s top lawyers has exposed decades-old secrets of the nation’s spy agency, telling his unfiltered thoughts on various presidents, the controversial waterboarding tapes and their back-door deals with Hollywood stars who wanted to trade secrets for cocaine.

John Rizzo became publicly well known in 2007 when the Bush administration nominated him to be the General Counsel of the Central Intelligence Agency, but his nomination was blocked because of his approval of waterboarding.

Much of his book, Company Man: Thirty Years of Controversy and Crisis in the CIA, tells the previously-guarded tales of clandestine operations including their frequent partnerships with Hollywood stars.

In the book, read by MailOnline, the connection between the CIA and the movie business was recently publicized by the film Argo, but Mr Rizzo’s book shows that their partnerships were more than just some creative storyboards and false movie advertisements.

'These are people who have made a lot of money basically creating make-believe stuff,' Mr Rizzo wrote, explaining why actors worked as perfect covers for intelligence operations.

'Their power and international celebrity can be valuable—it gives them entrée to people and places abroad. Heads of state want to meet and get cozy with them. Their film crews are given free rein everywhere, even in places where the U.S. government doesn’t normally have it.’

Hot topic: Rizzo's book, Company Man, opens with a discussion of his controversial handling of the video recordings of terror suspect Abu Zubaydah (left) being waterboarded

He didn’t name any specific names, but he recalled how one star who at first proclaimed to volunteer based on purely patriotic reasons actually had a different idea of how he should be rewarded for his help.

Mr Rizzo recalled an interesting conversation with the CIA employee who was the handler for this particular actor: ‘The actor refuses to take any money, but he told us that instead all he wants is for us to score him the best fifty-thousand-dollar stash of cocaine we can find. He seems to think we can get the real primo stuff. So that’s why I’m here. Is it okay for us to do it?’ he recalled the unidentified agent asking.

Mr Rizzo shot down the request and said that the actor ended up helping the agency free of charge.

Some of the more politically-loaded anecdotes that Mr Rizzo included about the Commanders-in-Chief who were in charge during his time at the CIA, which he joined in 1976.

He repeatedly slammed President Clinton and said that after he was elected ‘it was increasingly apparent that President Clinton couldn’t care less about the Agency or the rest of the intelligence community’.

'Couldn't care less': Rizzo slammed President Clinton, saying that he 'wasn't interested in, didn't care about, the Agency at all' and gave them the worst snub that by sending Hillary to an agent's funeral in his place

Not a fan: Breaking his own rule of always voting for an incumbent president or party successor, Mr Rizzo opted not to vote for John McCain in 2008 because he had 'serious pause about his temperament'

‘(Clinton) wasn’t interested in, didn’t care about, the Agency at all. For an organization whose relevance and impact is so utterly dependent on its relationship with the commander in chief, being ignored is even worse than being mistrusted,’ he wrote.

His most damning critique came when he told how the Democratic President sent then-First Lady Hillary Clinton to attend the funeral for a fallen operative in his place.

Mr Rizzo called the move ‘the most hurtful presidential snub I witnessed in my entire career’.

‘Bill Clinton, our new president, couldn’t find the time to make the ten -minute trip from the White House to the CIA to pay his respects. He sent his wife instead. It was an unforgivable slight from a man who had famously told the American people during his just-completed campaign, “I feel your pain,”’ Mr Rizzo wrote.

His appears to have taken the most personal slight from Clinton but did not pass that along to the rest of his administration.

‘Unlike Clinton, Al Gore had always seemed to be a sophisticated, engaged, and supportive patron of the CIA.... George W. Bush, on the other hand, was a governor with zero experience in intelligence matters,’ he wrote.

In spite of his clear problems with President Clinton, that didn’t stop him from voting for him in his re-election as he admits to always voting for an incumbent president or their successor. The only exception to this rule was the 2008 election when he opted to vote for Barack Obama over John McCain to follow President Bush’s two terms, and he wrote ‘what I had heard and personally observed about John McCain gave me serious pause about his temperament’.

Positive temperament: Former CIA directors George Tenet (left) and Leon Panetta (right) were both praised for their approachable and comfortable manners in dealing with their inferiors

Mr Rizzo clearly has interesting views on the various Presidents, but his insights were even more detailed when it came to their appointments of CIA directors.

He called George Tenet, the director appointed by President Clinton who served through a portion of President Bush’s term as well, ‘the most “regular guy”’ director during his tenure and praised his easy and comfortable approach with staff.

‘He often shambled into meetings in the hallowed director’s conference room with tie askew, sometimes in his stocking feet, gnawing away on an unlit Cuban cigar from the stash he had accumulated courtesy of visiting heads of foreign intelligence services,’ Mr Rizzo wrote.

He gave a similarly-positive review of Leon Panetta, who was appointed by President Obama.

‘For his part, (Panetta) looked every bit as Italian as his name, but it was more the way he came across— sunny, earthy, without a shred of formality or phoniness— that reminded me of my late father and all of his brothers who had been the products, like Panetta, of a first-generation Italian American family,’ Mr Rizzo wrote.

‘He loved to laugh and joke, as did I, and we were forming an easy, bantering relationship.’

The book was released on Tuesday, coming out just days before the controversial tell-all written by former Secretary of State Bob Gates who slammed his former commander, President Obama.

Mr Rizzo left the CIA in 2009, making his five year break between being in office and publishing his book significantly longer than year-and-a-half that Mr Gates’ waited, but Mr Rizzo implies that it is something of an inevitability that all secrets will end up coming out eventually.

‘If all my years and experience at the CIA taught me anything, it’s that virtually every secret doesn’t stay secret forever, and that the shelf life of new secrets is getting shorter all the time,’ he wrote.
