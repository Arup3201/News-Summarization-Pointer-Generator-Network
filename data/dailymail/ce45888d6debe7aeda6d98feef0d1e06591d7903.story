A man was rescued by Vietnamese fisherman after he had been left drifting at sea for eight days on a broken down yacht.

Kenneth Putney, 54, had been with three others towing the yacht from the Philippines to Thailand when the rope broke on December 15 in high winds.

He jumped on to the yacht because he feared it would be lost, but was spotted by fisherman Trieu Van Oai waving for help eight days later 15 miles off the coast.

Mr Oai of the Soc Trang province in Vietnam, then called two other fishing boats to help drag the yacht back to shore.

Mr Putney, of Melbourne, Florida, lost contact with Captain Force, the tug boat he had been using to tow the yacht, because the information system on the broken down vessel was also down.

He was so hungry when he got off the yacht he ate three packs of instant noodles, without even being boiled, when he met the Vietnamese fishermen, Vietnamnet have reported.

Coastguard Vo Hoang Liet, of the southern Soc Trang province, said Mr Putney was in good condition after being rescued.

He said Putney will be handed over to the U.S. embassy.

But Mr Liet has not said what happened to the other vessel.
