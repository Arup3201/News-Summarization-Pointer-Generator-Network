Diana, Princess of Wales' former chef has attacked her brother Earl Spencer for what he calls the neglect of her final resting place at his Althorp Estate in Northamptonshire.

Darren McGrady, who cooked for Diana as well as the Queen has posted several photographs of the memorial on Twitter, showing the lake near her grave covered in algae.

However, the estate has maintained that her burial site is being well looked after, saying the hot summer months had caused the algae to spread quickly, making it more difficult to remove - and that this has been a widespread problem for waterways across the country.

In a series of emotional Tweets, Mr McGrady implored Earl Spencer to remove the algae around the memorial

A spokesperson for Althorp said a team regularly cleans the lake but the algae is a problem in hot weather

Taking to Twitter, Mr McGrady said: 'If I cared for Princess Diana in life as you are doing in death I would have been fired.

'Please tidy up the vegetation on the island.'

Posting photographs after apparently visiting the site, he added: 'Made me so sad to see how Althorp Estate has neglected Princess Diana's resting place.' 

The exact spot where the the princess is buried is secret for security reasons, but a memorial to the mother-of-two was located on a small island in the middle of a lake.

Visitors pay £18 to visit the house and 14,000-acre estate and can lay flowers at a specially constructed temple near the island, with thousands visiting every year to pay their respects.

Gardeners 
and contractors have been battling to control the spread of algae in 
Round Oval lake, and after taking advice from experts have taken measures such as placing bales of barley in the water.

Some
 2,000 carp have also been introduced into the lake in the hope they 
will eat the algae blooms, which are almost impossible to completely 
eradicate.

'Algae is an unsightly problem for many lakes in the summer months,' a spokesman from the Althorp Estate told MailOnline. 

'Althorp employs contractors to deal with what is a highly invasive and fast-growing weed on a regular basis, and the Althorp gardeners also tackle it as part of their summer programme - the exceptional temperatures of this summer have made the task of keeping it entirely under control extremely difficult.' 

The spokesman added that the gravesite's security and maintenance were dealt with by Earl Spencer 'with matchless care', and that he takes his responsibility for the site 'extremely seriously'. 

Algae has been a common sight across many of the UK's waterways this summer.

Blooms can be caused by a combination of soaring temperatures and sharp downpours.

Algae blooms are more prevalent in very sunny spots.

The chef spent 11 years working Buckingham Palace but left the Royal household after Diana's divorce from Prince Charles in 1996.

He then went to work for Diana in Kensington Palace.

Mr McGrady is now living and working in Texas and has written  cookery books featuring recipes enjoyed by the royals.

Earlier, McGrady paid a visit to the Paris underpass where Diana died following a high speed car crash 

In the hours after Diana's death, several rows erupted between the Queen, Prince Charles and Earl Spencer.

The Queen, it was reported, did not want Diana's remains brought to any royal palace upon their return from Paris. 

Prince Charles went to France to accompany his ex-wife's body back to the country.

In a  misjudgement of public opinion, the Queen initially refused to cut short her annual holiday in Balmoral

It is understood that Prime Minister Tony Blair had to mediate. 

However, Diana's mother Frances Shand Kydd and a spokesman for Buckingham Palace later denied reports of any row, describing it as 'a rag-bag of nonsensical speculation'.

Downing Street and Earl Spencer also denied any rift.  

The Queen wanted any funeral to be a private affair, however, the public demanded a major ceremony to allow them to pay tribute. 

Earl Spencer then decided that Diana should be buried on the Althorp estate rather than committed to family's crypt in the church in Great Bington because of security concerns.
