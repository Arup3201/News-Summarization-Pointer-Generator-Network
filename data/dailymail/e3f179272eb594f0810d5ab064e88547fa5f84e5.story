Nothing can stir the quiet reserve of a monk.

Except maybe United Airlines.

Brother Noah of the Monastery of Christ in the Desert, in Abiquiu, New Mexico, offered to help Brother John Baptist rearrange a flight home from Malawi.

And so began a saga of monumental proportions that led an exasperated Noah to exclaim down the phone: 'Thank you for speaking. God bless you. I will pray for you. But you have not been helpful.'

Dispute: United Airlines told New Mexico monk Brother Noah he couldn't buy a new return flight for his colleague because they suspected the ticket was bought fraudulently. It sparked a terse row

It started, according to the New York Times, in late November.

John Baptist had bought a $2,489 return flight to his native Malawi to visit his sick mother.

As time went on it became clear he would have to stay longer, so he contacted the Benedictine monastery.

Brother Noah said he would take care of it.

Little did he know what imbroglio lay ahead.

'He was told that the company never received payment for the ticket,' the Times reported.

Baffled, the monk explained his colleague had already used the first leg of the ticket.

United accepted that but said they suspected it was fraudulently purchased so he was not allowed to use John Baptist's credit to purchase a new flight.

The United representative concluded the conversation by saying Abbott Philip, the monastery leader, should drive three hours to Albuquerque airport to discuss the discrepancy.

'It was my tone of voice': Noah said he instantly regretted his outburst but the situation was later resolved

That's when Brother Noah lost it.

'My monastic life is about staying peaceful in all circumstances. I failed during this call,' he told the Times.

'It was my tone of voice. I knew that it manifested anger.'

Thankfully for Noah, it was not in vain.

United eventually conceded after the monastery posted an open letter on their website and made a few more phone calls expressing their discontent.

John Baptist was finally given his rescheduled ticket, $350 credit, and an apology.
