Supporters have raised $20,000 for an Atlanta security guard who became an internet sensation this week after he posted videos online showing his refusal to give in to abuse from troublemakers.

Darien Long made headlines earlier this week after a video showing him tasering a violent woman outside Atlanta's Metro Mall spread online – it has now been viewed more than one million times.

And since then more and more videos are emerging of the zero-tolerance guard refusing to give in to violent threats.

In the footage, filmed by a camera on Long’s uniform, men are heard warning they’ll follow him home; he is racially abused; spat at; threatened with violence and objects are thrown at him all because he’s asked people to leave the shopping center or to stop hovering outside.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Zero tolerance: Darien Long has been lauded as a hero after a shocking video showed him tasering a woman outside a mall in Atlanta. An online fundraising campaign is currently at $20,000 supporting the guard

Cornered: A new video shows a mother was tasered after she and her children attacked a security guard in an Atlanta shopping mall

Warning: Long repeatedly tells the woman to 'back it up' before tasering her when she lashes out at him. The footage won the Atlanta Metro Mall guard plaudits online and there is now a fundraising campaign in his honor

Despite being in a position most would find terrifying, Long says he is 
determined to enforce the rules and believes doing so ultimately helps 
his community.

He told Atlanta news station WSB-TV: ‘I feel like the taser and the 
camera are the two most effective tools that I have. Do what you're 
supposed to do or you get what's coming to you.'

‘What you do is clean up the neighborhood so other businesses can come in and downtown Atlanta can prosper,’ he added

There has been particular support for Long from 
residents of the city who say they are fed up with people 
believing they are above the law.

‘This is basically what we deal with every day,’ Resident Daniel Van 
Briesen told the local broadcaster. ‘For it to happen in the shadow of the 
capital building and the courthouse is a bit ridiculous.’

The five minute video which launched the vigilante guard into the public
 eye on Tuesday is from an incident in May. It opens with the 
guard warning children outside who are making noise.

However, two mothers soon step in and start pushing Long with one 
warning the guard:  'Don’t yell at my motherf***ing kids! You’ll get 
beat!'

Abused: Several videos showing the threats and slurs leveled against Darien Long can be seen online

Ready to attack: Another video shows a woman who is about to throw a poster board at the security guard before a friend holds her back

The confrontation gets increasingly tense as the woman refuses to move 
back from the mall, starts shouting racial slurs and encourages the 
young children to join in the abuse.

Long is repeatedly heard telling the woman to ‘back it up’ and move away
 before she walks to the mall doorway and lashes 
out.

Long then tasers her.

The shocking video has won the officer legions of fans on Youtube and news site Reddit. Reddit launched the online appeal to raise money for Long after seeing the response to his story.

Supportive comments on Reddit include: ‘Whatever they pay this guy, it's
 not enough’, ‘Guy looks like a family man, looks like he is risking a 
lot’ and ‘remind anyone of a sheriff in a wild west movie.

One Youtube viewer simply writes: ‘Why do those naggers keep nagging him?

Reddit editor Ryu Kenya said they started the campaign because Long is a ‘nice guy’.

‘He is a nice guy and that area is very dangerous,' he wrote on the website. 'There is a cop 
station around the block but people still sell drugs around there. He 
has to wear kevlar and has his own mugshot book. He was not too proud 
about tasing the woman and wished it could have been avoided.’

Resilient: Darien Long says he wants to help clean up downtown Atlanta via his work as security guard for the Atlanta Metro Mall

Fundraising page: The Reddit campaign had raised almost $20,000 for Darien Long on Saturday morning and was still going up

The woman who attacked Long was reportedly charged with disorderly 
conduct, criminal trespassing, contributing to the delinquency of a 
minor, and simple battery.

Since the campaign began it has raised $20, 000 so Long can buy himself more equipment.

And it appears he needs it. Further videos posted online by Long show several abusive exchanges.

In one he asks a group to leave but they consistently refuse, loitering 
by the doorway and threatening to follow him home and ‘beat’ him.

It ends with one of the group – another woman – throwing a sandwich board at him.

Other videos show him confronting men he suspects of drug dealing and shoplifting.

In another a man repeatedly pushes Long in the chest and calls for him to fight him in the street.

'Stay out the mall and we won’t have an issue', Long tells one of his abusers in a video

The guard seems bemused by the attention his work has attracted and said he doesn't want fame. What he wants is to see his area improve.

‘I don’t care about the fame or none of that crap. What I want is on 
street gambling to go away, The people who just hang down here to make 
money and be disruptive and for the drug dealing to leave 
this area,’ he says on a response posted on YouTube.

'You can’t ever get rid of all the crime in any city but it shouldn’t be in 
such proximity to the seat of power of the state of Georgia and the city
 of Atlanta. People should be able to come downtown and do what they 
want to do.'

'I’m really nobody to be honest with you.'
