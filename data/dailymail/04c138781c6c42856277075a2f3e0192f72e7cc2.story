The knockout stages of the World Cup begin on Saturday with the possibility of the dreaded penalties now a reality for the 16 nations left in the competition.

Since it's inception in 1982 there have been 22 penalty shootouts in the history of the World Cup, with the most recent coming in Uruguay's 4-2 spot-kick win against Ghana at the 2010 showpiece.

With nine of the 16 teams left in Brazil having experienced the drama of penalties before, Sportsmail trawls through the history of the 12-yard lottery.

Controversial: Uruguay were the last country to win a World Cup penalty shootout against Ghana in 2010

Inconsolable: Ghana were denied their first World Cup semi-final appearance with a 4-2 loss vs Uruguay

GERMAN EFFICIENCY

Unsurprisingly Germany are the kings when it comes to a penalty shootout - missing only one of their 18 attempts from the spot.

The three-time World Cup champions have a perfect record of played four, won four and were involved in the very first shootout at the 1982 World Cup against France.

History: Germany have never lost a penalty shootout winning the first one vs France in the 1982 World Cup

A controversial semi-final against the French, when Germany goalkeeper Harald Schumacher wiped out Patrick Battiston - resulting in the midfielder being knocked out unconscious and losing three teeth, they held their nerve to win 5-4 in Seville.

Most memorably, for all the wrong reasons if you're an England fan, Germany broke Sir Bobby Robson's side hearts with a 4-3 penalty shooutout win following Three Lions duo Chris Waddle and Stuart Pearce misses in Turin.

Alone: Stuart Pearce missed one of England's penalty in their 1990 World Cup semi-final loss vs Germany

ARGENTINA ACCURACY

Germany - Won four, lost none

Argentina - Won three, lost one

Brazil - Won two, lost one

France - Won two, lost two

Belgium - Won one, lost none

Uruguay - Won one, lost none

Holland -Â  Lost one, won none

Switzerland - Lost one, won none

Mexico - Lost two, won none

Not forgetting...

(England - Lost three, won none)

Over the years Argentina have graced the World Cup with the likes of Diego Maradona and Ossie Ardiles, but for all their flair - the country also can hold their nerve when it comes to shootout.

The two-time winners boast the second best record from the spot, having won three and lost one.

Inspired 
by Diego Maradona, they reached the 1990 final with consecutive penalty 
wins against Yugoslavia and Italy before losing to the Germans.

In
 1998 they beat England 4-3 from the spot to reach the quarter-finals at
 France '98 in what is familiar sight for the 1966 winners.

Their
 most recent shootout came at the 2006 World Cup, where they lost to the
 hosts Germany in the quarter-finals before infamously a brawl broke out
 among the players in the centre circle after Argentina's elimination in
 Berlin.

Joyous occasion: Argentina have won three out of four penalty shootouts including vs England in 1998

Ugly scenes: Argentina were involved in a brawl with hosts Germany after their 2006 elimination on penalties

WHAT ABOUT THE HOSTS?

Brazil are bidding to win a record sixth World Cup and Luiz Felipe Scolari's side boast a positive record from the spot having won two and lost one.

The Samba stars most famous triumph in a penalty shootout came at the 1994 World Cup final in USA against Italy, when Azzurri talisman Roberto Baggio's ballooned spot-kick gave them a third World Cup triumph with a 3-2 win.

If the Selecao have to hold their nerve from the spot, they will be hoping their fervent support will unsettle their opponents.

Iconic moment: Roberto Baggio missed penalty in the 1994 World Cup final gave Brazil victory vs Italy

Devastated: Roberto Baggio looks crestfallen as his missed penalty gives Brazil the 1994 World Cup

THIRD TIME LUCKY?

For Mexico they will be hoping three's the magic number for them in Brazil.

The Group A runners-up boast a miserable record from the spot losing both their shootout matches.

Coach Miguel Herrera will be hoping his team won't emulate the sides of 1986 and 1994 if their last-16 match against the Dutch, who have also never won a World Cup shootout, is decided by penalties.

Practice: Mexico coach Miguel Herrera (centre) will hope his side end their penalty shootout hoodoo

GONE BUT NOT FORGOTTEN... ENGLISH WOE

Yes as you're probably well aware, England have the worst record in the history of a World Cup shootout converting just seven of 14 of their attempts.

Played three and lost three is an undesirable record for the 1966 winners and that record won't improve following the Three Lions' group stage exit in Brazil.

As well as
 the disappointment of 1990 and 1998, 2006 ended in another shootout 
defeat - this time to Portugal with Owen Hargreaves the only one 
converting from the spot in a 3-1 loss for Sven Goran Eriksson's side.

Looking
 at the eight-year cycle as of which England are knocked out on 
penalties - it is highly feasible that if they had progressed from the 
group stage a similar outcome would have occurred.
