Restaurant customers ought to order smaller plates of chips, the Government's recycling advisers declared

Restaurant customers ought to order smaller plates of chips, the Government's recycling advisers have declared.

They say that too many people leave cold fried potatoes uneaten on their plates - and as a result hundreds of thousands of tons of food waste each year have to be dumped by pubs, restaurants and fast food chains.

They called for waiters to be trained to tell customers they ought to have less chips, and for 'stealth menus' designed to encourage diners to go for lighter meals.

The campaign against chips was launched by the Waste and Resources Action Programme, a £30million-a-year quango set up to encourage more recycling.

Its verdict that restaurant meals are too big and people ought to have fewer chips on their plate came just a day after a committee of MPs told families to stop eating meat on a daily basis.

The Commons International Development Committee said people should eat less pork, lamb and beef because the country is never more than a few days away from a food shortage and because of the need to cut the amount of food thrown away.

The WRAP recommendations on chips were greeted with hostility by the restaurant trade, which said it was impossible for waiters to tell customers to order short portions, because the customers would think the restaurant was trying to short-change them and diners would resent the implication that they were too fat.

Richard Bradford of the Restaurant Association said: 'It's just not on. The customer is going to think the waiter is making a rude suggestion.'

WRAP - which is financed by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs - based its chips verdict on a large-scale survey of more than 10,000 people. It also ran a more detailed survey of over 5,000 people and 12 focus groups.

It found that people go to 
restaurants either to fuel up on food or for a social occasion, and that
just over a quarter of them leave food on the plate. Most of these were young women, the survey said.

It
added: 'The main dish and the accompanying sides were the courses most 
likely to be left; while the appetisers, starters and desserts were less
likely to be left.

'The staple foods that tend to get left at the end of the meal are chips, vegetables and salad.

'Chips, vegetables and salad are seen by
some customers as plate fillers rather than part of the meal they 
ordered. Some do not even consider these food types, especially salad 
garnishes, to be intended for consumption.'

It said that the food most often left on the plate was chips and that 32 per cent of people who leave food leave chips.

The survey quoted people who said they regarded chips as 'extras' and one man who said: 'I always leave the grass.'

WRAP said that to solve the problem 'eating venues could train their staff so they are better able to talk about portion sizes with customers and provide more information on the meals, for example ingredients, cooking.

'As the research findings suggest, 
portion sizes can, at times, be a sensitive subject so discretion and 
skill need to be used when communicating relevant information to 
customers.'

Menus might offer different-sized meals 
and dishes which 'would give customers more choice and empower them to 
order the right amount.'

But the document, Understanding Out 
Of Home Consumer Food Waste, warned: 'Any messages or communication 
initiatives developed need to be stealthy and subtle, as diners do not 
want to be told what to do when out enjoying themselves nor do they want
to think about food waste when eating out.'

Stealth
menu suggestions made by the WRAP research include portion sizes marked
by three chillies, by numbers of scoops, by different sized plates, or 
by a three bear system in which different-scale meals would be called 
mummy bear, baby bear and daddy bear.

However Mr Bradford, who runs Porters English Restaurant in Covent Garden, central London, said: 'Our waiters have to ask people what side orders they want. These are free. If they then ask if people want a smaller portion, customers are going to think we are trying to get away with giving them less.

'Then people will start thinking we are trying to tell them they are overweight.

'Soon we will have TripAdvisor saying we are being rude to the customers and trying to cheat them. Recommendations for smaller portions are just not something that can come from the waiting staff.'

WRAP's annual budget from DEFRA reached £80million a year in the mid-2000s when the body was given a major role in persuading local councils to abandon weekly rubbish collections and replace them with fortnightly bin rounds and compulsory recycling.

However it was blamed for helping create a backlash at the polls against councils who stopped weekly collections after it published a controversial series of recycling recommendations.

These told councils to introduce fortnightly collections only in winter so there would be fewer unpleasant smells in the early months, and not to bring them in close to an election so that voters could not register a protest.

Its budget is now down to £30million and has been under review in the early months of this year.
