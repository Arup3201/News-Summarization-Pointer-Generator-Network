Anxious: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is under tremendous pressure to make sure his company does well following its IPO

Facebook posted its revenue of $1.2billion this afternoon in its first earnings report since going public.

It comes as good news to the social network, which has been struggling to recover its image with investors after its botched initial public offering in May.

The revenue report shows that Facebook is up 32 per cent in worth from last year, welcome news for a struggling Wall Street.

However, the market closed with shares of Facebook down at $26.84, an 8.5 per cent loss.

According to CNET News, the second quarter earnings have a profit of 12 cents a share.

Following the botched initial public offering in May, Facebook was under tremendous pressure to perform well financially.

The report, released after closing bell today, will reveal the social media giant’s first performance as a public company.

But with stocks tumbling from $38 a share down to less than $30 as of July 25th, the news may be grim indeed for the company, helmed by 28-year-old CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

Its shares tumbled ahead of its first quarterly results announcement, hurt by a weak quarterly report and a foreboding outlook from online game developer Zynga, which hosts popular games like Farmville.

Facebook Inc shares dropped seven per cent to $27.65 in pre-market trading while Zynga Inc slumped a staggering 40 per cent to $3.04 – the two most heavily traded stocks before the bell on Nasdaq.

Waiting game: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during afternoon trading on the 24th; investors and analysts are highly anticipating Facebook's earnings report

Tense times: Investors, seen on the floor of the NYSE on July 24, looked apprehensive, left, and right, Facebook's share price fell to a low of $25.87 on June 5th and has shakily landed at $29.34

And investors are bracing themselves for what could be some very bad news.

'Considering
that Zynga was a recent IPO, it's another black eye for Wall Street. 
You bring up an IPO and you get burnt again and again,' Joe Saluzzi, 
co-founder of Themis Trading LLC in Chatham, New Jersey, told Reuters.

Zynga's
results are 'not creating good confidence in the sector as they (social
media companies are) certainly related to each other.'

The fate of the two companies is intertwined, with Zynga's games, such as 'FarmVille' and 'CityVille,' helping to make up more than a tenth of Facebook's revenue last year.

Late on Wednesday, Zynga slashed its 2012 outlook and the company's quarterly results badly missed Wall Street targets.

A number of brokerages cut their price targets on the company on Thursday, including Wedbush, Citigroup and Lazard, casting some uncertainty over Facebook ahead of its inaugural results after the close of trading Thursday.

Earlier this week, the options market was forecasting a 14 per cent move up or down in Facebook shares following the results. That means options investors expect the stock to rise to as much as $32 by Friday or to fall to as low as $24.

Since the IPOs, shares of Facebook and Zynga have been in a downward spiral. Facebook, at $28.45, is off nearly $10 from its market debut price of $38 in May, and Zynga is at $4.92, nearly half its debut price of $9.50 in December.

Despite the steep decline in their share prices, Facebook and Zynga are both trading well above their market valuations. Facebook is still trading at around 70 times earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data.

An analysis by Thomson Reuters StarMine puts the company's intrinsic value at a modest $9.72 a share, or about one third its current value, based on estimates of the company's projected growth for the next decade.

Earlier in the week, analysts, on average, were expecting revenue in the second quarter to grow 28 percent to $1.15billion.

With over 900million users, Facebook is the world's largest social networking company, challenging established Web companies for consumers' online time and for advertising revenue.
