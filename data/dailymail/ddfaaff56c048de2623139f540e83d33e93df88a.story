A teenager died after suffering horrific burns when a patio oven burst into flames during a party, it emerged yesterday.

Lisa Jones, 19, was standing nearby when petrol was poured on to the chimenea. Within seconds she was engulfed in flames and screaming in terror.

The shop assistant had been visiting her boyfriend, Ryan Nightingale, also 19, a soldier in the Grenadier Guards, when the tragedy occurred.

He was interviewed by police but later released without charge.

Miss Jones was taken to a specialist hospital but lost her fight for life on Wednesday – 11 days after the accident.

Yesterday
 neighbours described hearing a loud scream coming from the party, which
 was attended by around 20 teenagers at Mr Nightingale’s family home in 
Chorley, Lancashire.

It is understood his mother, Jane, 40, a carer, was at work when the accident happened at around 10.30pm on June 21.

‘It
 sounded like a young woman was getting attacked by the way she was 
screaming,’ said one resident who went to help.

‘She was lying down on 
the floor. You could see instantly there were blisters all over her 
face.

Hospital: Miss Jones was treated for 11 days but died yesterday at Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester

Boyfriend: The party was taking place at the house of Ryan Nightingale, Miss Jones's soldier boyfriend

‘She managed to walk to the ambulance and she only had a mask 
on her face, like a cooler. All her hair had gone and she was screaming 
while on gas and air in the ambulance.

‘To me it looked like only 
the top half of her body was burnt, but when I spoke to Ryan he said she
 had full body burns.

'She wasn’t the only one who got burnt either, Ryan
 suffered burns too.’

It is understood Mr Nightingale, who is based 
in Aldershot, Hampshire, took part in the Trooping the Colour ceremony 
at Buckingham Palace last year.

He had only recently started dating Miss
 Jones, a former hairdressing student, from Llanfairfechan, North Wales,
 and she had gone to stay with him while he was on leave.

Last night 
close friend, Wendy Jones, 40, said she was broken hearted at the death 
of the teenager, who was like an adopted daughter to her.

On her 
Facebook page, Mrs Jones said: ‘I just can’t make sense of it all. I 
refuse to believe she’s not here.’

A police spokesman said: ‘A 
19-year-old man from Chorley has been interviewed under caution but was 
released while police conduct further inquiries into the tragedy.’

Chimenea patio ovens are popular garden accessories in the UK.

They are 
based on ovens used by Mexican tribes, which were made from river clay 
and shaped to protect the fire from rain.

The tragedy occurred just 
hours after a man in Chorley suffered burns to his hands in an almost 
identical accident.
