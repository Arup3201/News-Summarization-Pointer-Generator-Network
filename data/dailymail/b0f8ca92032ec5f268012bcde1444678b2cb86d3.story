Wanted a burger: 34-year-old private high school teacher John Edward Maust is accused of drunkenly kidnapping some of his students at knifepoint after bumming a ride on the streets of Altadena. He reportedly demanded they take him to Jack-in-th-Box

A California private prep school teacher is facing multiple criminal charges after he drunkenly threatened three of his students at knife-point while demanding they drive him to Jack-in-the-Box, police say.

John Edward Maust must have really wanted a burger Saturday night when three of his 17-year-old students at Arroyo Pacific Academy recognized him and on an Altadena street corner and he asked for a ride.

The boys reported they were initially frightened enough by their 34-year-old teacher's behavior to pull over and jump out of the car.

Deputies say Maust ordered them back in, pulled out the knife and told them to go to the fast food restaurant.

At some point, one of the boys managed to call 911.

When Maust saw a sheriff's department helicopter, he got out of the car and fled, deputies said. None of the students was hurt.

On Sunday, around 1:30 p.m., Maust walked into the department's Altadena station and surrendered without incident.

He
 was booked at the Crescenta Valley Station for investigation of 
kidnapping, false imprisonment, and criminal threats. He was being held 
on $100,000 bail.

Private school: Maust is a teacher at Arcadia's Arroyo Pacific Academy, where tuition costs over $16,000 per year. Each of the students he allegedly kidnapped is male, 17 and was unharmed

Emails 
were sent to the president, vice presidents and principal at Arroyo 
Pacific in an attempt to locate an attorney for Maust, but none of them 
responded early Monday.

A
 message was also left for the detective who wrote the news release, but
 he was in the field. Jail records do not have an attorney listed for 
Maust.

The school's website calls him an instructor. It does not say what he teaches or how long he has been there.

Arroyo
 Pacific Academy is located in Arcadia and serves grades 9 through 12. 
Tuition and fees for the 2014-2015 academic year came in at just over 
$16,000.
