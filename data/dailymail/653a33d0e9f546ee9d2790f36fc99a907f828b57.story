West Indies batsman Darren Bravo is set to make his return to action from injury after being named in a training squad ahead of England's Test tour.

Bravo's World Cup ended early due to a hamstring injury, but he has been put down in a list of 20 players by the West Indies Cricket Board for a training camp in Antigua that begins on April 5.

Star name Chris Gayle, however, will miss the camp and the England series, which starts on April 13, due to ongoing back problems and his Indian Premier League commitments.

In what will be new coach Phil Simmons' first series since taking charge, West Indies have given four uncapped players the chance to make their case for a Test berth, with Carlos Brathwaite, Miguel Cummins, Shane Dowrich and Shai Hope called up.

Meanwhile, spinner Devendra Bishoo could be in line for a Test recall after two years out, as is Veerasammy Permaul, who last played a five-day fixture in December 2013.

S Benn, D Bishoo, J Blackwood, C Brathwaite, K Brathwaite, D Bravo, S Chanderpaul, S Cottrell, M Cummins, S Dowrich, S Gabriel, J Holder, S Hope, L Johnson, V Permaul, D Ramdin, K Roach, M Samuels, D Smith, J Taylor.
