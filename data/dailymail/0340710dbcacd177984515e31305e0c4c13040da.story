Veteran Jamie Streets is facing homelessness with his  and young family after Cornwall County Council told him he was not eligible for accommodation

Furious veterans have criticised the Prime Minister and a local council after a war hero, who was discharged from the army because he had cancer, is facing homelessness with his wife and four children because he was told he was not eligible for a council house.

Jamie Streets spent 15 years in the army - completing tours of Kosovo and Afghanistan and also serving as a guard to the Queen.

But after the 34-year-old developed a brain tumour he was medically discharged from the army last year and relocated to live with his young family - including his two-year-old daughter - in Falmouth.

He still has part of the tumour in his head that medics were unable to remove.  

However he has since been told he will not be allowed a council house and will be turfed out of his temporary accommodation in just four weeks - after Cornwall County Council refused to give them a permanent home.

The decision does not comply with the Armed Forces Covenant, introduced by the Prime Minister in 2011, to support members of the forces who have left the army to ensure they are supported and not disadvantaged - particularly if they have been injured.

In an open letter to Mr Cameron and Andrew Kerr, leader of Cornwall County Council, veterans from the Household Cavalry Association in North West and West Yorkshire, said they were 'angry and incensed' by the decision. 

The letter said: 'This is not acceptable treatment for one of our brothers who has served his Queen and country with impeccable professionalism for over 15 years, and who would have completed 22 years of service, given the opportunity.' 

It calls on officials to reverse the decision to ensure that Mr Street, his wife Charmaine and their children are not rendered homeless because of a 'ridiculous red tape issue.'

Mr and Mrs Streets were told they would be moved from their temporary accommodation within a month after their housing bid was turned down.

They did have a private landlord but moved out because they couldn't afford the rent and were given a temporary home.

But because they left the private rental voluntarily they have been accused of intentionally making themselves homeless and have been denied any other accommodation. 

Mrs Streets said: 'My husband is a proud man and didn't want bailiffs and the police turning up at the door so we did the honourable thing but in the council's eyes that was not the right thing to do. They say we have made ourselves intentionally homeless.

'They are throwing me, my husband and four children out on the streets so we are going to be homeless - who do we turn to?' 

Mr Streets spent 15 years in the army and would have served for 22 years had he not been medically discharged after suffering a malignant brain tumour

Mr and Mrs Streets have four children - Suvannah, two, Briea, nine, Leo, 13 and Tyler, 15. 

Their problems started when Mr Streets suffered an accident and was diagnosed with a brain tumour.

Mr Streets served 15 years in the army - first in the Household Cavalry Regiment where he went to Kosovo and Afghanistan.

When he returned in 2008, he took up ceremonial duties with the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, but it was after being thrown twice from a horse that he was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour.

He underwent surgery which left his speech affected and with no movement in his left side. After four weeks in hospital and rehabilitation he returned to work.

However, a seizure suffered a year later led to the end of his Army career as he was medically discharged in May 2014 - against his wishes.

Mrs Streets added: 'Jamie wanted to serve 22 years in the army and we had planned to buy our own home, but it didn't happen that way. He adored his job - he was army barmy - but he lost it through medical reasons. 

'Are we expected to walk the streets with our four children? The kids are worried and it's putting a big strain on us as a family.' 

Since he was discharged from the Army Mr Streets' payments have dwindled because he has been unable to find work. He has received his driving licence back, after the DVLA took it away because if his seizures and has enrolled on a plumbing course - hopeful of finding work.  

A spokesman for Cornwall Housing said it did not comment on individual cases but said they may provide temporary accommodation until housing can be found.

He said:  'It is important to understand that being provided with temporary accommodation by the council is not a guarantee that permanent council or housing association accommodation will be offered.'

The Household Cavalry Association of North West and West Yorkshire have also launched an online petition calling for action to prevents Mr Streets and his family from being left homeless. 

A Government spokesman said they would be looking into the case 'urgently.' He told the Daily Express: 'We changed the law so that seriously injured serving personnel and former servicemen and women with urgent housing needs must always be given top priority.'  

Dear Sirs,

We are ex soldiers representing the Household Cavalry Veterans Association and need to tell you how very angry and incensed we are with Cornwall Council and Downing Street this weekend.

Yes I know you are all busy spending tax payers' money on lavish lifestyles (Councillors) and dishing out foreign aid, however, we have some serious issues on our own doorstep that are NOT being resolved.

It has come to light that one of our colleagues and fellow Household Cavalryman, Jamie Street, who was medically discharged from the British Army in 2014 with the Rank of Corporal of Horse (COH), is to be evicted from his council house along with his wife and four young children in one month by Cornwall Council. Their application for a permanent council house was rejected due to some ridiculous red tape issue. Maybe he would stand a better chance if he was a foreign refugee or asylum seeker.

Perhaps Cornwall Council, and its leader Andrew Kerr haven't heard of the Armed Forces Covenant.

And perhaps it would be courteous of Downing Street to reply to Jamie's letters sent via email, one on the 9th and the other on the 20th January, 2015.

I also hear that Conservative MP for Falmouth, Sarah Newton, was unable to offer any plausible assistance. Yeah right.

Veterans have said they are 'incensed' by the treatment of war hero Jamie Streets and called upon David Cameron to act so he and his family are not made homeless by the council's decision

Let me tell you about Jamie. He joined the Army in 1998 at Winchester ATR initially with Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, where he completed two tours of Kosovo, one in 2000 and the other in 2001. Later in 2001, he rebadged to The Household Cavalry as a Life Guard based at the armoured regiment in Windsor.

In 2007, he was deployed to Afghanistan on Op Herrick for a 6 month tour as a CVR(T) Reconnaissance Crew Commander. After returning from Afghanistan, Jamie volunteered for ceremonial duties at Knightsbridge, where he was a troop COH, and carried out a wide range of duties including but not limited to Queens Life Guard, trooping of the colour, state visits and Sovereign escort.

Jamie was involved in a riding accident where he was thrown from his horse and smashing his head off a fence, suffering from serious head injuries which resulted in a malignant brain tumour.

He underwent surgery which affected his walking and speech and left him with no movement in his left side, he also contracted Meningitis. But after four weeks in hospital with rehabilitation, at Headley Court, he returned to work. However, Jamie suffered a seizure the following year which later led to the end of his Army career. He was medically discharged in May 2014, against his wishes. Jamie still has part of the tumour in his head, as they were unable to remove all of the cancer cells.

The family moved to Falmouth, the children were enrolled at local schools and they moved into their private rented accommodation.

Since then, his Army funds have dwindled as Jamie, 34, has been unable to find work. The DVLA has returned his driving licence and he has enrolled on a plumbing course with the hope he can support his family again. But in the meantime, they are facing the prospect of being homeless. Why?

I speak for all veterans of the Household Cavalry and wider military family when we say that this is not acceptable treatment for one of our brothers who has served his Queen and country with impeccable professionalism for over 15 years, and who would have completed 22 years of service, given the opportunity.

We implore you Mr Cameron and Mr Kerr to act now to ensure Jamie Street and his family are given appropriate housing so they can get on with their lives and bring up their children in a safe environment.

Yours Sincerely,

Robert Mather & Michael Creagh & Robert Barry Plus 1600
