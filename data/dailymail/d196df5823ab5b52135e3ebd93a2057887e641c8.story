Released: Republican Marian Price has been in custody for two years but will now be out on licence

An IRA bomber who was jailed for a car bomb attack on the Old Bailey is set to be released from prison following a ruling by the Parole Commissioners.

High-profile republican Marian Price, 58, had served seven years after the 1973 car bomb attack before being released on licence, but her licence was revoked by former Northern Ireland Secretary of State Owen Paterson in May 2011.

She has been in custody ever since and is facing two dissident Republican-related charges.

Republicans have been conducting a high-profile campaign for her release and she has ongoing health issues which have required treatment in Belfast City Hospital during her time in prison.

She is now known by her married name Marian McGlinchey.

A statement from the Northern Ireland Office said: 'The Parole Commissioners have decided, given her current circumstances, to release Marian McGlinchey on licence. Such a licence is normally subject to conditions.'

She was convicted along with her sister Dolours Price for their role in the 1973 car bomb attack on the London court, which resulted in the death of one man and injured more than 200.

Price died in Dublin earlier this year.

The NIO statement, on behalf of current Secretary of State Theresa Villiers, said: 'Marian McGlinchey’s licence was initially revoked in May 2011 by the then secretary of state for Northern Ireland following a recommendation made by a single independent parole commissioner.

'All such cases are subject to a full review by the parole commissioners at which the prisoner has a right to full legal representation.

'This can include the appointment of a special advocate to represent the prisoner’s interests in respect of any closed material that may have been presented during the hearings.

'The parole commissioners’ decision reflects the fact that my predecessor’s decision to revoke Mrs McGlinchey’s life licence was justified in May 2011. This decision was taken after receiving a recommendation from the parole commissioners that her licence should be revoked.

'Information about the proceedings of the parole commissioners are not to be made public and the Northern Ireland Office therefore cannot comment further.

'Marian McGlinchey continues to face charges for two separate offences through the Northern Ireland courts.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
