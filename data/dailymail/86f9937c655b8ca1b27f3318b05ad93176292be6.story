'The five acres of gardens are simply stunning - they are very well cultivated and feature upper and lower gardens.

'Stonehill House has been described as the quintessential English country house but it is much more than that. It is the perfect blend of history and contemporary living all set in a stunning location. It is a dream home in every sense.'
