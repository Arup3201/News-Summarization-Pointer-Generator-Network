Italy beat Norway 2-0 in its opening European Championship qualifier on Tuesday as Antonio Conte extended his winning start as coach.

Simon Zaza scored his first international goal in the 16th minute as Italy showed little sign of missing suspended striker Mario Balotelli. 

Strike partner Ciro Immobile was offside and in the goalkeeper's line of vision, but the referee waved away Norway's protests.

It was Conte's first competitive match in charge of the Azzurri after steering Italy to a 2-0 friendly win over the Netherlands on his debut last week.
