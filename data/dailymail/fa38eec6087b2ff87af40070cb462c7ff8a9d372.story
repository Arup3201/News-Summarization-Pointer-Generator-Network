A besotted knifeman who plunged a blade into his ex-girlfriend’s chest while trying to 'get her attention' is back on the streets.

David Martin, from 
Sunderland, was originally accused of attempted murder after he thrust the weapon deep into the left side of Kate Taylor's chest after she told him he had to learn to live without her.

Prosecutors at Newcastle Crown Court 
today accepted the 31-year-old's plea of unlawful wounding, 
which carries a maximum sentence of five years. He will be released from
 custody due to the 17 months he has spent on remand since the attack, which
 happened in his car.

Attack: David Martin, who stabbed his girlfriend in the chest, is back on the streets after prosecutors accepted his plea of unlawful wounding

After two trials Martin was found not guilty of attempted murder but two juries 
failed to agree whether he should be convicted of wounding with intent, 
which carries a life sentence.

Judge Paul Sloan QC sentenced Martin, who had also admitted having an offensive weapon, to 20 months behind bars.

The attack took place in the car park at EDL at Doxford Park in Sunderland, where the former couple both worked, last May.

The judge said: 'In a moment of desperation you took the knife out of your bag and held it against Miss Taylor’s chest, wanting to get her attention, wanting her to understand the state you were in.

'You clearly remained dependent upon her. There was a struggle and she tried to push the knife away.

'During the course of the struggle the knife, which was being held at an acute angle to her body, went into Miss Taylor’s chest.'

The court heard the blade entered four inches into Miss Taylor’s chest and she told jurors she had feared she was going to die.

Judge Sloan told Martin: 'You had not intended to stab her, let alone injure her, but you accept your actions were unlawful and reckless.

'Miss Taylor has been left permanently scarred to her chest.

'She has made a good physical recovery from the wound but the attack has had a marked psychological effect upon her.'

Martin must abide by a restraining order which prevents him from contacting Miss Taylor in future

The judge said: 'You introduced a large, potentially lethal knife into an argument and held it against Miss Taylor’s chest.

'There was a high risk of serious injury given the confined space you were in. It was a particularly dangerous act.

'This was an abuse of trust and power.'

Martin’s criminal past was revealed in court yesterday for the first time.

Prosecutor Nicholas Campbell QC said Martin first got in trouble with the police when he was just 13 and he was cautioned for using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour intending to stir up racial hatred.

Martin was cautioned for burglary when he was aged 14 and convicted of assaulting a boy of the same age that same year.

In February 2003 he was cautioned for affray which involved him fighting in the street.

In 2008 he was cautioned for using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour. In September 2009 he was cautioned for battery which involved him punching a 17-year-old male in the street.

In April 2012, after his relationship with Miss Taylor ended, but before the attack on her, he was given a penalty notice for being drunk and disorderly.

During the trials relating to the attack on her, Miss Taylor, who is in her 20s, told jurors she had not realised the knife was in her chest and initially thought her former lover had been trying to kiss her after she told him they were over.

She said she only realised she had been stabbed when she saw the handle sticking out of her skin.

Miss Taylor said: 'I thought he was trying to grab me or get hold of me and kiss me or trying to pull me into the car, then obviously I realised what was happening.

'There was just blood everywhere and obviously I saw the knife, or part of the knife, coming out of my chest and in his hand.

'I thought I was going to die because of where the wound was.'

The court heard Miss Taylor had reluctantly agreed to meet up with Martin on her lunch break that day on May 11 last year after he had 'bombarded' her with messages and calls since their break up in November 2011.

The court heard the couple had both been at work that morning and Martin had inundated her with messages while she repeatedly told him their relationship was over and they were now just friends.

Martin told jurors at his last trial: 'I thought that the knife would get her attention.'

He said he did not mean for the blade to penetrate her skin and had held the weapon against her while trying to 'pin her up' and make her listen to him.

Martin told the court: 'I mean obviously I did stab her, I’m responsible for that. As soon as I realised the knife had went in and I saw the blood I took my hand off, I didn’t want the knife to go in, I only wanted to pin her up.'

He told the court he and Miss Taylor had split six months before the stabbing but had stayed in touch while he was trying to 'wean away' from her.

He said while explaining his thoughts to Miss Taylor he felt he was not getting her full attention.

He said: 'She pulled the sun visor down and started topping herself up, she put eyeliner on and lipstick on.

'I just thought that she wasn’t listening, I thought, because I was in such a state, a desperate state, I didn’t feel like I had her attention.

'I saw the knife in the bag and decided to pull the knife out and try and pin her up to get her attention.

'I thought that the knife would get her attention.'

Martin said Miss Taylor struggled when she saw the knife the blade went into her accidentally.

Judge Sloan accepted Martin had been carrying the knife around in a rucksack while thinking about harming himself, not anybody else.

Glen Gatland, defending, said Martin has suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder and adjustment disorder.

Mr Gatland said: 'What he was wanting was her attention. He told her she wasn’t listening to him. He said he needed help from her.

'He saw the knife in the bag, produced it and held it to her to get her attention.'
