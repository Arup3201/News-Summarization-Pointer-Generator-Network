What started with a cheap shot four years ago will finally reach a deafening crescendo on Saturday night as Jon Jones defends his UFC light heavyweight title against Daniel Cormier.

The warring pair will settle their differences in the Las Vegas Octagon after months of verbal insults.

And having come to blows last August in a disgraceful brawl, Jones and Cormier clashed again on New Year's Day as hotel security stepped in to calm yet another heated exchange.

Former UFC fighter Tyson Griffin posted two videos on Instagram showing the latest altercation as both camps traded barbs.

At Friday's weigh-in, meanwhile, Cormier turned his back on Jones as they pair refused to face-off. They then traded final verbal insults at the fighters' meeting. 

Cormier, meanwhile, believes he has exposed Jones as two-faced ahead of their mouthwatering match-up.

'I respect him as a champion but I don't necessarily respect that he wears many faces,' he told Sportsmail. 'I think we need to see the real Jon Jones and we're starting to see that.

'When he's in public or on TV, he portrays a person he's not really all the time. Sometimes he can be rude to fans and with some of the things he's said to me off camera.

'When you wear that many hats, it starts to get confusing.

'His emotions towards me are real. If you're indifferent towards someone, it doesn't matter. If you feel like you're superior to that person, it doesn't matter. But when you have genuine dislike for someone it's hard to hide your emotions. Because he has real-life animosity towards me, his real feelings are starting to come through.'

The rivalry has been brewing since 2010 when Jones approached Cormier backstage at UFC 121 as Cain Velasquez took on Brock Lesnar.

'I reached out to him and told him I'd beat him in a wrestling match, sarcastically,' Jones explained to Sportsmail. 'He got all bothered about it and when I walked away I felt very awkward; I felt like it told a joke that didn't go down very well.

'I thought it was over but a week later, on Twitter, him and another wrestler tagged me in a conversation in which they were both insulting me, saying that I sucked at wrestling.

'I realised the guys were serious and that not only did my joke not go down well but it became a reason for Daniel to have beef with me. I read the tweets and that's when I realised I didn't like him. A grown man couldn't take me being sarcastic and he twisted it up in his mind to have a reason to dislike me.'

Cormier added: 'Hes easily the person I've felt the most animosity for, just because it's been festering for so long.

'It's been a number of things over the course of time Jon and I have interacted. It's not one situation that's made him have the feelings he has or me the feelings I have. It's a number of things that we've experienced that's made us get to this point.

'I didn't see him as a rival at the time. I knew who he was and I was a fan of him. I'd been watching him come up the UFC ranks. I didn't see him as a potential opponent until we started to interact with each other and I thought OK, at some point we're going to fight.

'Is that going to affect how I compete inside the Octagon? Not by any means. I'm going to fight like a professional and in the way I need to fight. But in terms of outside the Octagon, I've never had an opponent who has gotten to me that way Jon has.'

And while Jones acknowledges Cormier's achievements to date, he believes he is dreaming if he thinks he can become a UFC champion.

'He's a dreamer,' he said. 'He has high hopes and goals but he hasn't been able to achieve these things. He had a dream to be a national champion but he lost in the final. He had a dream to be an Olympic champion and it didn't happen. Now he has the opportunity to be a UFC champion and I don't believe it's going to happen. He's a dreamer because he doesn't have the heart to pull it off.

'He talks so much because he's trying to make people and himself believe in him. He speaks a good game but when push comes to shove I don't think he has what it takes to be champion like me.'

Jones has reigned as champion since 2011 and has made seven successful defences but Cormier is convinced he is the man to end that run.

'I match up well against him,' he said. 'There's no secret formula to beating him, I just feel style for style I match up pretty well against him.

'I think people will be surprised. Anytime a guy is as dominant as Jon has been, we tend to hold him in such high regard that we think he's unbeatable. But no-one is unbeatable.

'If Jon Jones, after being as dominant as he's been, gets beat, people will think, "wow, where has this guy come from?", because regardless of how good you are, they don't expect you to be as good as him and be on the level he's dominated for so long.'

A poll among a handful of UFC fighters earlier this week backed Cormier to shock the champion but Jones insists too much has been made of the challenger's wrestling ability.

'It's not a wrestling match,' he added. 'He is a great wrestler but he was magnificent back in 2004 and 2008 when he wrestled in the Olympics. It's been several years since he was at his wrestling peak and I'm going to show that. I'm going to show I can wrestle him.

'Yes he might be a little bit better of a wrestler than me at a wrestling tournament but it's not a wrestling tournament,. People are punching you and elbowing you and keeping you guessing.

'I've fought many wrestlers and I've been able to mesmerise them and not allow them to do what they thought they were going to do. I believe I'll do the same with Daniel.

'He has a lot of confidence and it seems so simple when you're coming up with a plan but when you're in there it's difference. My strategy changes mid fight and I'll do something he didn't prepare for and pick him apart.

'I'm proven against guys like him and I believe he'll be another victim.'
