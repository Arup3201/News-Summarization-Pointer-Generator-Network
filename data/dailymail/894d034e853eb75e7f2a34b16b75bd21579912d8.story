The mother of one of the Navy SEALs killed in the raid on a U.S. consulate in Libya has criticised the administration for its slow response to the massacre earlier this month.

More than two weeks after the apparent terrorist attack in Benghazi which killed ambassador Chris Stevens along with three other officials, an FBI investigation team has yet to enter the city.

Cheryl Croft Bennett, whose son Tyrone Woods died alongside his comrade Glen Doherty while trying to protect consulate staff, took to Facebook to denounce the lack of progress in uncovering the circumstances behind the raid.

Criticism: Cheryl Croft Bennett has hit out at the FBI's delay in investigating her son's death

The grieving mother has been posting regular online messages paying tribute to her son and describing her experiences with government officials in the aftermath of the tragedy.

On Thursday Ms Bennett wrote: 'Don't want to ever politicize the loss of my son in Libya, but it has been 16 days and the FBI has yet to get to Benghazi to begin their investigation.

'Apparently they have made it to Tripoli but haven't been allowed to enter Benghazi. Meanwhile, the diplomatic outpost where Tyrone and Glen died, was not and is not secured. Absolutely unacceptable.'

The stinging criticism came as it emerged that federal agents who were sent to Libya in the aftermath of the attack on September 11 have not yet arrived in Benghazi.

The delay in sending the FBI into the city where four Americans were killed has been blamed on security worries.

Officials
have said that the bureau is unwilling to put agents in harm's way and 
that Benghazi must be made safe before the investigators can enter.

At
FBI headquarters on Friday, a spokesman said 'we are moving forward 
with our investigation', but would not reveal the current location of 
the agents in Libya.

Separately, the State Department is further reducing the U.S. Embassy staff in Tripoli for security reasons.

Ms Bennett's criticism of the FBI investigation is all the more striking given her earlier praise for the way top officials reacted after the death of Mr Woods and the three others.

Writing about the repatriation of her son's body, she said: 'The entire afternoon was overpowering and unreal.

'Little did I know that I would find myself in a reception room being comforted, hugged, and, yes, even kissed by the President of the United States. Along with the President, there was Vice-President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, and General and Mrs Colin Powell.

'They were all wonderful. They held my hand, offered condolences, gave warm hugs, and were extremely compassionate and genuinely sad for my loss, as I fought back tears and tried to project an image of strength to honor my SEAL son.

'Each of them commended Tyrone for his courage, his bravery, and his ultimate sacrifice for his country.'

Slow? The Obama administration has not yet allowed FBI agents to enter Benghazi on security grounds

Mr Woods and Mr Doherty were staying in a secure annex elsewhere in Benghazi when they heard about the attack on the consulate, thought to have been inspired by a U.S.-made YouTube video mocking the Prophet Muhammad.

They rushed to the compound, helped a number of diplomats evacuate, and recovered the body of Sean Smith, a computer expert who had earlier died of smoke inhalation.

After most of the officials had been moved to safety, the SEALs faced a renewed assault using rocket-propelled grenades, which reached their targets and killed the two young men.

Hillary Clinton told Ms Bennett that her son had been responsible for saving the lives of 30 people.
