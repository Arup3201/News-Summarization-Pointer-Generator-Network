U.S. military efforts
against Islamic State have cost nearly $1 billion so far and are
likely to run between $2.4 billion and $3.8 billion per year if
air and ground operations continue at the current pace,
according to a think tank analysis.

But a ramp-up, including more air strikes and a significant
boost in ground forces, could send costs soaring to between $13
billion and $22 billion annually, said the analysis released on
Monday by the nonpartisan Center for Strategic and Budgetary
Assessments.

'Future costs depend, to a great extent, on how long
operations continue, the steady-state level of air operations,
and whether additional ground forces are deployed beyond what is
already planned,' said the report by Todd Harrison and other
analysts. 

Costs of war: Chuck Hagel told reporters the Pentagon has spent roughly $7 million to $10 million per day on operations against Islamic State since June 16

Pricey battle: The reported $7M to $10M per day the U.S. government is shelling out for the strike in Syria helps keep the stealth F-22 Raptor (seen here being refueled midair September 26) in the air

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told reporters last week that
the Pentagon has spent roughly $7 million to $10 million per day
on operations against Islamic State since June 16, when it first
deployed troops to assess the Iraqi military and advise its
leaders.

The United States began air strikes against Islamic State
militants in Iraq on Aug. 8 and expanded them to Syria on Sept.
22.

Coalition forces have carried out 290 air strikes in Iraq
and Syria, of which the U.S. military has conducted 265.

U.S. planes are flying about 60 reconnaissance sorties per
day, and some 1,600 U.S. troops are being deployed in Iraq.

The think tank's analysis estimated the cost of U.S.
operations against Islamic State through Sept. 24 at between
$780 million and $930 million. That agreed roughly with Hagel's
estimate of the cost per day.

If air operations continue at a moderate level and deployed
ground forces remain in the range of 2,000, then the cost of the
U.S. military effort against the militant Islamist group would
likely run between $200 million and $320 million per month, the
report said.

But increased air operations, coupled with the deployment of
up to 5,000 ground troops, would cost between $350 million and
$570 million per month. High-intensity air operations with a
deployment of 25,000 troops could cost $1.1 billion to $1.8
billion per month, the report said.

Defense officials have indicated they will have to seek more
funding because of the fight against Islamic State.

The U.S. used its stealth F-22 Raptors for the first time ever in combat in the first airstrike against ISIS in Syria.

The $150million jets were used to bomb an ISIS command center in Raqqah.

According to the Daily Beast, the Raptor strikes along with the Tomahawk cruie missiles launched from the sea cost around $79million.

This is a sliver over the cost of India's recently completed unmanned mission to Mars, which coast $74million.

Army General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, said last week that the Pentagon's 2015 budget proposal
assumed stable or declining commitments abroad and some
flexibility to adjust military pay and healthcare and to retire
weapons systems.

'Commitments have gone up,' Dempsey told reporters, noting
that Congress has rejected some proposals to retire weapons and
adjust military compensation.

'So if you're asking me do I assess right now ... that we're
going to have budget problems? Yes.'

The center said its cost estimates were based on publicly
available information about the types of aircraft and munitions
being used, as well as expenditures in previous operations.
