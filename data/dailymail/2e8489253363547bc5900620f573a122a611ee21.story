Philippe Coutinho was excellent against Chelsea last week and had a fine game against West Ham United at the weekend too.

He set up two goals including one for Raheem Sterling with one of my two favourite passes of the season.

It was just as good as Cesc Fabregas’s assist for Andre Schurrle against Burnley.

Philippe Coutinho and David Silva's stats

Now Coutinho needs to start producing these kind of performances week in, week out.

He is still only 22 and has all the talent and skill to become a top player but he is not yet consistent enough.

David Silva is 29 and was the best player on the pitch at Stamford Bridge, even scoring after reacting first to Sergio Aguero's shot which was possibly heading wide, but he plays like that most weeks for City.

Coutinho should take a leaf out of his book.

In his time in England, Coutinho has been unable to match Silva, as our table shows.

But his last two games show he is more than capable.

He just has to show he can keep it up.

CITY NOT OUT OF IT

It was not the game we all hoped for at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, far from it. I predicted a 1-1 draw but had hoped for a thriller. It was anything but.

Before the game I’m sure most Chelsea fans would have taken a draw to keep their five-point lead at the top. As soon as Manchester City scored you could sense Jose Mourinho and his team were happy with that.

In the second half they sat deep and soaked up City’s pressure but came away with a result that suits them just fine.

The fixture list looks kind for them for the rest of the season. Of the top sides, they only have to visit Arsenal, whereas Man City have to go to Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur. But Chelsea do play Liverpool and Man United at home and they will not be easy games.

Man City have Yaya Toure and Wilfried Bony to come back from the Africa Cup of Nations and Manuel Pellegrini’s men came from behind to win the league last season.

This title race is not run yet.

FIVE INTO TWO DOESN'T GO

If the battle for the title is a two-horse race, then the fight for Champions League spots could be tougher than ever.

Arsenal, Manchester United, Liverpool and Tottenham all won, which makes Southampton the biggest losers of the weekend. One thing is for sure - it’s going to be a real scrap for those two spots.

It was good to see Theo Walcott scoring again after injury and Arsenal proved they can win without Alexis Sanchez.

The transfer window is always mad but a fit Daniel Sturridge will feel like the signing of the season for Liverpool. Their campaign starts now.

Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen lead the way for Spurs, Man United keep grinding out results and, despite a surprise defeat, Southampton are still in the mix. Let battle commence.

TRIPLE JOY FOR JON

1 - Jon Walters has as many Premier League hat-tricks as Eric Cantona, Dennis Bergkamp and Cristiano Ronaldo. They all have one each.

Scoring a hat-trick at any level is an achievement but Jon Walters can be proud of his perfect treble - a goal with either foot and a header.

Queen Park Rangers will be kicking themselves for the way they conceded the goals, but Walters took them well. With Bojan out for the season, Stoke need somebody to step up and score. Walters has made a good start.

DEFOE DEAL WAS A NO-BRAINER FOR GUS

Signing a player in the January transfer window is always a bit of a risk. You never know if they are going to hit the ground running or disrupt your plans.

When Gus Poyet brought in Jermain Defoe it was as close as you can get to a risk-free deal. If there’s one thing Defoe guarantees, it’s goals - he’s not even fully fit and he already has his first for Sunderland.

There were a lot of clubs looking at him because everyone knows he is a master finisher.

The deal he’s on works out as big money but if his goals help keep Sunderland in the Premier League, there’s no question it will be money well spent.

ERIKSEN'S THE NEW FREE-KICK MASTER

The free-kick Christian Eriksen hit against Sheffield United was unbelievable. Then he followed it up with another beauty against West Bromwich Albion. The Dane is fast becoming one of the Premier League’s top free-kick specialists.

I love the way he takes them. He is so relaxed and in control of his body and he can bend the ball into either corner. He hits it in quite an old-fashioned way - more David Beckham than Cristiano Ronaldo - and decides where to swerve the ball rather than hitting it and expecting it to move around itself.

Free-kicks can be a game of cat and mouse with goalkeepers, but he is keeping the keepers guessing. He’s got a way to go to match the Premier League’s best, as our table  shows, but he’s certainly on the right road.

2 - Things are not looking pretty for Steve Bruce and Hull City at present. Their 3-0 drubbing at home by Newcastle United means they have won just two of their last 13 league games at the KC Stadium, a run that stretches back to last season. They have also failed to score in 11 of their last 15 Premier League games and have kept only one clean sheet in their last eight league matches.

12 - Burnley have leaked goals all season. Of the 38 they have let in, 12 have been headers - that’s more than any other team in the league.

4 - Maybe Louis van Gaal should give Radamel Falcao a regular starting spot. In nine league starts the Colombian (has been involved in seven goals, scoring four and setting up three.

167 - Daniel Sturridge made a scoring return from injury for Liverpool and bagged his first goal since the opening day of the season - 167 days ago. His last goal came against Southampton at Anfield on August 17.

5 - Roberto Martinez will have been delighted Everton hung on to win at Selhurst Park. It stopped a run of five consecutive away defeats.

4 - Mesut Ozil clearly enjoys playing against Aston Villa. All four of the goals he has been involved in this season have come against Paul Lambert’s side - he has two goals and two assists.

9 - Newcastle United like a sub who can make an impact. Yoan Gouffran’s goal against Hull City made it nine times this season that a Newcastle player has come off the bench and scored. That’s three more than any other side.
