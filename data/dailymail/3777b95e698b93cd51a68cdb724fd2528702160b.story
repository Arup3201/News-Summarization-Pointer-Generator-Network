It was an excoriating public dressing-down, an email fired off by a retired naval commander to the three children he regards as a ‘bitter disappointment’.

But yesterday former nuclear submarine captain Nick Crews, 67, got an unequivocal broadside back.

After the publication of his father’s heartfelt tirade – a no-punches-pulled  salvo accusing his public school-educated children of failing in their careers and marriages – Mr Crews’s son Fred, 35, replied: ‘Sorry, but you made me.’

'Cock-up' children: Fred Crews and his sister Emily were the recipients of an email from their father in which he spoke of the 'bitter disappointment' he felt at his children's inability to pursue fulfilling careers

Speaking as he prepared for his shift at
 a taxi office, Fred, bare-chested and sporting a stomach tattoo, said 
his father could no longer treat him ‘like a sailor in his command’.

And he added his father had done ‘enough of that in my formative years to ensure that I do not have the confidence to succeed in life now’.

He accused Mr Crews of acting like his own father before him, and insisted he would not speak to him again without an apology.

The family feud burst into the public domain when Nick Crews published the email at the request of daughter Emily Crews-Montes, 40 – one of his targets – who now lives in France and works as a translator for a publisher. She is the only one of the siblings still speaking to her parents.

Dear All Three

With
 last evening’s crop of whinges and tidings of more rotten news for 
which you seem to treat your mother like a cess-pit, I feel it is time 
to come off my perch. 

We 
are seeing the miserable death throes of the fourth of your collective 
marriages at the same time we see the advent of a fifth... 

Having
 done our best to provide for our children, we naturally hoped to see 
them provide happy and stable homes for their own children.

Fulfilling
 careers based on your educations would have helped – but as yet none of
 you is what I would term properly self-supporting.

So
 we witness the introduction to this life of six beautiful children none
 of whose parents have had the maturity to make a reasonable fist at 
making essential threshold decisions.

The
 predictable result has been a decade of deep unhappiness over the fates
 of our grandchildren. If it wasn’t for them, Mum and I would not be too
 concerned, as each of you crashes from one cock-up to the next.

It
 makes us weak that so many of these events are copulation-driven and 
then to see these lovely little people being so woefully let down by 
you.

I can now tell you 
that I for one have had enough of being forced to live through the 
never-ending bad dream of our children’s domestic ineptitudes.

I want to hear no more from any of you until you have a success or an achievement to tell me about.

If
 you think I have been unfair in what I have said, by all means try  to 
persuade me to change my mind. But you won’t do it by simply whingeing. 
If that isn’t possible then I rest my case.

I am bitterly, bitterly disappointed.

Dad

In his email, addressed to ‘Dear All Three’, Mr Crews spoke of the ‘bitter disappointment’ he felt at the ‘miserable death throes of the fourth of your collective marriages’, his children’s inability to pursue fulfilling careers based on public school educations, and the fact none of them was ‘properly self-supporting’.

He said his six ‘beautiful’ grandchildren had parents who lacked maturity and sound judgment ‘as each of you consciously, and with eyes wide open, crashes from one cock-up to the next’.

Witheringly, he added that for he and his wife Sarah, ‘it makes us weak that so many of these events are copulation-driven, and then helplessly to see these lovely little people being so woefully let down by you, their parents’.

Yesterday Nick Crews told The Mail on Sunday he had ‘nothing to apologise for’ and that many friends facing similar challenges had emailed him messages of support.

Earlier, Fred, clearly furious that the row had gone public – through an article in yesterday’s Daily Mail – said: ‘I’m not going to dignify him with a full response.

‘He knows what the score is. I’ve spoken to my Mum and I responded to his email. I likened him to his own father and left it at that. He said what he wanted to say but there are other things he shouldn’t have said.

‘He said he didn’t want any of us to contact him again until we had some good news. Well, if he wants us to talk to him now, then he shouldn’t have written that. That’s what needs to be apologised for.’

Speaking from the Plymouth terraced house where he is living with his sister, Fred insisted his father had only himself to blame.

‘He compared us to his friends’ children and said what an embarrassment we were and how he can’t boast about us,’ he said. ‘Well, I’m sorry, but you made me. That also needs to be apologised for.’

But perhaps something of his father’s sense of duty has rubbed off on Fred after all, as he insisted he was unable to stay and provide a full interview as he could not let his employer down.

‘My father made me who I am today and I think he did a good job,’ he said. ‘I do not leech off him, my mother or society – except for a brief stint on Job Seekers’ Allowance – nor am I a criminal of any sort. I try to keep to the values I have been brought up with.’

Nearby, at the family’s detached, six-bedroomed house in a Plymouth suburb, an unrepentant Nick Crews made a robust defence of the decision to set out his frustrations in the email, sent earlier this year. And his wife Sarah made clear she backed every word. ‘Absolutely, it needed saying,’ she insisted. ‘An email was the right way to go because they absolutely took notice of something there in black and white.’

Mr Crews said: ‘What I was saying to my children was that if they got their ducks in a row, their children would be getting a better start. As a father and a grandfather, don’t you have a duty to do that? I think you do. I don’t like living with the repercussions of this and it makes you very sad that your children hate you. But life is hard.

Unapologetic: Nick Crews (pictured yesterday) thinks his email was necessary

‘There are people in society who 
desperately need financial support and for that support to be sucked up 
by people, my children, who could do better is not acceptable to me.

 ‘My
 message to other parents who feel as I do is that you have a social 
responsibility to say your piece. I can remember my father saying things
 to me that I didn’t like to hear. Friends have emailed me to say, “I’ve
 had to write a letter like that and it’s not nice.” They have been very
 supportive.

‘If you had one child like this you’d think, “Do I say anything?” But I’ve had three out of three and you wonder whether you’re an appalling father with defective genes. It’s not just one of them that’s had a failed marriage – it’s three out of three.

‘Emily said to me, “We’re not  triplets, we’re all individuals.” But  they all needed the same message for their own individual reasons.  I thought that by sending it to all three none of them would be singled out as a black sheep.

‘One of the gratifying things about it is that they closed ranks and they came together and decided how they were going to cope with it. I think that’s fantastic. Certainly Emily has had this appalling email chucked at her and said, “Right, it’s time to pull my socks up”.’

Historic: Like his father, Fred went to Sherborne School in Dorset, where fees are £10,100 a term

Mr Crews, who spends his spare time restoring paintings and sailing yachts, said the children were sent to public schools because he felt it gave them the best possible start.

Like his father, Fred went to Sherborne School in Dorset, where fees are £10,100 a term. Emily, an Exeter University psychology graduate, attended Stoodley Knowle boarding school in Torquay.

Reflecting on the situation, Mr Crews felt moved to finally observe: ‘It’s not a bad thing to write and say, “Hey, look, you’re leaving a trail as you bash through life and your mum and dad are part of the wreckage.” ’
