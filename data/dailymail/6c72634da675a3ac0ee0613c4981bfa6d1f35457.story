The Ministry of Defence wasted £6 million on new high-tech earplugs that were supposed to allow soldiers to hear each other on the battlefield while blocking out the noise of explosions and gunfire. 

Senior officials tested the equipment in the UK before authorising the purchase. However, once the earplugs were tested on the battlefield, they were found to be ineffective.

Each set of earplugs was specially moulded for an individual soldier at a cost of £500. 

The new ear plugs were designed to allow soldiers to communicate on the battlefield while protecting their hearing from the sound of gunfire, but the system was scrapped because it didn't work (file picture)

The RAF were forced to write-off a BAE125 similar to this after it suffered hail damage at a cost of £488,000

The Personalised Interfaced Hearing Protection system was believed to be similar to the technology used by pop stars. 

MoD officials ordered 10,000 sets of the ear plugs to help protect the hearing of soldiers. Troops are reluctant to use traditional ear defenders on the battlefield as they cannot hear their comrades or vital radio communications. 

At the same time, the MoD admitted that it paid out £374,000 due to 'Noise Induced Sensorineural Hearing Loss'.  

The MoD also wasted £7.2 million on a mobile mine detection capability for Warrior vehicles, which was deemed 'unsuitable'.

According to the report, an RAF HS125 aircraft was removed from service early after it sustained damage during a hailstorm, costing the taxpayer £488,000. 

A stock take at RAF Marham discovered £10 million of missing equipment, while £1.5 million was spent on faulty software. 

In total, approximately £5.7 billion was wasted by the MoD, with £860 million spent on obsolete equipment.

Shadow defence secretary Vernon Coaker said troops were being sacked while 'money was frittered away on dud equipment'. 

The Ministry of Defence told The Sun: 'The ear defenders were trialled ahead of use in theatre, but during the constant rhythm of operations it became clear they required modification.'
