Actor Jude Law and musician Damon Albarn have joined around 800 people protesting outside the Russian Embassy in London over the arrest of 30 Greenpeace activists.

The pair, along with Paul Simonon from The Clash, have called the arrests a disgrace and described them as a personal blow as their friend Frank Hewetson is among those being held.

Relatives of the activists have also organised several protests across the country for the six Britons who are in custody, and a further 47 demonstrations are being held around the world.

The two celebrities were joined by Clash guitarist Paul Simonon who said there were no ground for the protesters to be labelled as pirates

Downtown Abbey star Jim Carter and his wife, actress Imelda Staunton, also attended the demonstrations.

The Russian coast guard seized the ship Arctic Sunrise and everyone on 
board following the September 18 protest at the offshore platform owned 
by Russia's state-controlled energy giant Gazprom in the Pechora Sea.

The activists are now in custody in the northern city of Murmansk charged with piracy, which carries a maximum 15 year sentence.

Law, whose children went to school with Mr Hewetson's, said: 'I am just adding my face and body to the mass of support.

'Of course I am worried about Frank because I care about his family and I
care about him but I know that he is incredibly durable.'

Protesters stood quietly behind banners reading 'Free the Climate 
Defenders', 'Journalist and Not Pirate' and 'Free The Arctic 30'.

British freelance videographer Kieron Bryan and UK activists Mr 
Hewetson, Philip Ball, Alexandra Harris, Anthony Perrett and Iain Rogers
have been charged over the protest.

Greenpeace denies any wrongdoing and described the charge as 'absurd and outrageous'.

Around 800 people are protesting outside the Russian Embassy in London over the decision to charge the activists with piracy

Six Britons are among the 30 Greenpeace protesters now being held in the northern Russian city of Murmansk

Albarn said: 'It does seem to be a slightly different idea in Russia's collective head about what activism actually represents.

'Nine times out of 10 people who protest peacefully, whether it is 
through music or through trying to scale oil rigs, are doing it because 
they believe they are saying something that will ultimately benefit 
society as a whole.

'We put people in power to look after us presumably, but 
unfortunately rarely do they.'

Vivienne Westwood also attended the Greenpeace demonstration outside the Russian Embassy in Kensington Palace Gardens

He went on: 'I want to express my support for Frank, his family and all 
the other families because at the end of the day this is a very human 
thing.

'There are people who are terribly worried about their loved ones.

'Everyone is concerned because it is Russia and they have a very bad record of bowing to international pressure.'

The families of Mr Bryan and Ms Harris travelled from their homes in Devon for the vigil.

Mr Bryan's mother, Ann, said: 'I am sick with worry; at least a protest like this makes me feel like we are not alone.

'None of the 30 should be facing that charge. Kieron was just doing his job.'

Mr Bryan's father, Andy, said: 'We do not want this attention to go away. We are coping with this day by day.'

Jim Carter, 65, who plays butler Carson in the hit TV series, said: ‘I am here to support the people who are ludicrously in jail in Russia on trumped-up charges.

‘They were not attempting to steal anything. They went armed only with their principles and a banner. It was a peaceful protest.

‘When an international organisation is accused of piracy, it is sick.’

Ms Harris's sister, Georgina, said she had received an email from her 
sibling saying she was safe and warm and urging her not to worry.

The Greenpeace boat Arctic Sunrise was stopped by Russian coastguard last month during the protests

Ms Harris said her sister seemed 'emotional' and added: 'It is hard not to worry considering everything that is going on.

'I am trying to stay positive but this is disgusting.'

Campaigners wrote messages of 'peace and solidarity' on paper doves, which are to be sent to those detained in Murmansk.
