One of Britain's best teenage sailors was heard saying 'sod it' after being begged to 'Go Faster!' before a horrific speedboat crash, a court heard today.

Great
 Britain sailing international Nia Jones then accelerated moments before the night time collision, it was claimed.

Jones
 and friend Elleni Morus, 17, were taking schoolgirls back after a day 
of sailing when their high-powered speedboats crashed in darkness.

Crash: This is one of the boats involved in the collision during a half-term sailing trip in October 2010

A court heard Jones began speeding and weaving after being told: 'Go faster, go faster' by her young passengers.

But
 after weaving in the dark and jumping the wake of her friend Morus' 
speedboat - they collided and sent schoolgirls flying into the cold dark
 water.

Jones and Morus were
 in charge of a party of 24 schoolgirls aged ten to 14 on a residential 
sailing course during half term holidays.

The
 court heard they had taken the girls ice skating for a treat and were 
returning to their hostel by boat late at night when the they crashed 
into each other.

One of the schoolgirls thrown into the water during the crash said Jones was begged to go faster by her young passengers.

The girl, who appeared via videolink, said: 'We were urging Nia to go faster and she said: 'Sod it' - and then did it.

Danger: The other boat involved in the crash, which took place when the boats did not have lights attached

Experienced: Morus and Jones were aged just 17 at the time of the accident, but were among the top young sailors in the country

'We
 were excited but some people told Nia to slow down. She went over the 
wake of the other boat a couple of times before we crashed.

'It was quite dark and our boat and the other boat turned into each others wakes and we crashed.

'I
 could see the other boat the whole time. Just before we collided I 
think we all knew we were going to crash but we didn't move or scream - 
we didn't have time to.'

The
 schoolgirl, who was 11 at the time of the crash, said she didn't 
remember being thrown out of the boat - but she came to in the dark 
water.

She said: 'I was in 
there for a couple of minutes before they picked me up. I was really 
cold and I was quite shocked so I couldn't swim back to the boat.'

Prosecutor
 Oliver Willmott told the court how four inflatable speed boats had 
illegally set off across Cardiff Bay without any lights in the night of 
the crash.

Cardiff Crown Court heard in the previous days the boats had been used for 'wake jumping'.

Mr
 Willmott said: 'This is where each boat jumps the others wake for a 
thrill road. It is also quite a potentially dangerous thing to do.

'There came a point where Jones came across the path of Morus and they collided.

'It
 was a sufficiently violent collision to throw two people into the water
 and to cause a third person to fall halfway into the water.

'A
 fourth young girl was thrown from one boat and landed in the other. In 
the most severe case a young girl suffered a brain injury of moderate 
severity.'

The court heard the young 11-year-old victim was not named.

The
 organisers of the sailing course - Nicholas Sawyer and Cardiff Bay 
Yacht Club - have admitted offences in connection with the accident and 
breaking Health and Safety regulations.

The court heard Jones and Morus, both of Cardiff, were not qualified to drive the high-powered rigid inflatable boats at night.

Morus and Jones, now both 20, admit piloting the boats without navigation lights on the night of 27 October 2010.

But both deny failing to travel at a safe speed and failing to keep a proper lookout.

The trial continues.
