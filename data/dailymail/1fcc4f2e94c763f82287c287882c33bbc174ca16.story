The last images taken by the beheaded journalist James Foley before his 2012 capture show the American was determined to share with the world the horror of the Syrian civil war.

The journalist's powerful work was often shot just yards away from explosions and gunfire, as he immersed himself in the conflict.

It is clear just how close to the action Foley was as he films Syrian rebels coming under attack just yards from where he stands and travels in the back of a truck with armed men.

In one clip, Foley films rebels preparing to fire a rocket launcher before they run for cover when the building they are next to crumbles under the impact of the Syrian army's heavy fire.

Foley also films a rebel sniper as he sizes up his next shot through a small hole in a thick stone wall.

Away from the front line of the conflict, he spent time with the civilians who were living through the war.

He is seen visiting a camp full of children, apparently well away from the mayhem, as they smile and pose for the camera. 

As well as filming the conflict, the American journalist appeared keen to capture the lives of civilians. In this clip Foley visits a camp full of children who were more than happy to pose for the camera

One of the more touching moments of Foley's final footage sees him film a wedding between a rebel sniper and a nurse who treated him in hospital.

The young bride and groom are seen exchanging rings before celebrating with friends and family.

In separate footage, also taken in 2012, Foley is seen speaking into the camera as he talks about the shocking scenes he has witnessed in Syria.

The American journalist shot some his final footage in Syria in 2012. Here is he seen filming a Syrian sniper sizing up his next shot.

A man is escorted away by rebels after finding himself in the middle of the crossfire between Syrian rebels and regime forces.

'We saw with our own eyes nine civilian bodies, some just body parts, from direct hits on men leaving a mosque or men on the streets.

'We saw a student killed on the streets, and a fruit vendor killed when he was trying to help evacuate the wounded.

'These were clearly army positions throwing shells and heavy mortars into heavy civilian population, hitting schools and houses.' 

The footage shows how immersed in the war zone Foley was. In this shot he is filming from the back of a truck as he travels with rebel fighters

Foley was kidnapped in Syria on Thanksgiving 2012 while working for the GlobalPost agency.

He was taken hostage at gunpoint by militants from the group Jabhat al Nusra while reporting from Taftanaz, northern Syria.

Disturbing footage of his execution appeared on YouTube last week in a video titled 'A message to the US', in which an apparently coerced Foley, 40, recites a pre-prepared script presumably given to him by his captors which he delivers unflinchingly to the camera.

Foley also leaves a haunting message for his brother, John, who he is heard to say is either a past or serving member of the US Air Force.

Referring to airstrikes launched nearly two weeks ago in Iraq, Foley says: ‘I died that day, John, when your colleagues dropped that bomb on these people. They signed my death certificate’.

It has since emerged that U.S. President Barack Obama sent special forces troops to Syria on a secret mission to rescue American hostages, including James Foley, but they did not find them.
