Residents have discovered anti-Semitic flyers in their letterboxes which urge 'white Australia' to 'wake up'.

The flyers distributed in the Sydney beach-side suburb of Bondi - known for its high number of Jewish residents - make reference to white power group Stormfront.

The letters claim 'the Jews' encourage 'race mixing' and that they 'own' Hollywood and the majority of Western media.

CEO of the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies Vic Alhadeff told Daily Mail Australia he completely condemned the posters, which were signed off by a Sydney chapter of Stormfront, Squadron 88.

'The flyers are an appalling compilation of racist stereotypes, which is all too predicable from neo-Nazi organisations. It's no coincidence that 88 represents HH, which stands for Heil Hitler.'

'It's most concerning that such blatant hatred is alive and well in our country and its deeply disturbing that group which holds such views should feel that the climate in conducive for them to come out of the woodwork,' Mr Alhadeff said.

The flyers also claimed 'Jews have been kicked out of countries 109 times throughout history... Could it be that having them in a European country is harmful to the host?'. 

When asked if he had seen similar cases in the past, Mr Alhadeff said he had and although these groups were known for their position on such issues incidents were on the rise.

'There has however been a very concerning rise in anti-Semitic sentiments these past months.

'This has been evident in a large number of incidents ranging from swastikas on the streets of Sydney to the verbal assault of children on a school bus most recently', he said.

Mr Alhadeff was referring to an incident that took place in Randwick at the start of this month where a group of teenagers boarded a bus full of Jewish school children and terrorised them.

'Such conduct violates the values of our country and what we stand for as a multicultural society which overwhelmingly respects diversity,' Mr Alhadeff continued.

One Bondi resident who received the letter sent it to American Jewish newspaper Algemeiner and told them he was 'disgusted' by the discovery.

'It is part of an increase in anti-Semitism that such low people as the ones who issued these flyers feel comfortable coming out of the woodwork', Abraham Blasenstein said.

'It is not a pleasant thought that there are some people that would like to do the worst to you for no reason other than their cruel character. It was the smallest touch of what it must have felt like for Jews in Europe before WWII.

'There, there was no hope and no support, at least now in Australia it is reasonable to believe that most decent people will find this type of leaflet appalling,' Mr Blasenstein continued. 

Australian Race Discrimination Commissioner Dr Tim Soutphommasane tweeted that he was 'very disturbed' by the flyers

Australia Race Discrimination Commissioner Dr Tim Soutphommasane told Daily Mail Australia via a statement that extremely racist messages such as the flyer have no place in Australia and the Jewish community has his full support.

'We should be very concerned to see such anti-Semitic material being circulated in Sydney. It is a worrying sign that extremists are being emboldened to spread their messages of racial hatred. Stormfront is a website associated with neo-Nazi organisations and with the advocacy of racist doctrines. 

'Ideas about racial hatred or purity simply have no place in Australian society. Those responsible for this material should be condemned.'

The letter was signed off by Squadron 88 which is a Sydney offshoot of neo-Nazi group Stormfront, whose logo is pictured here

'Members of the Australian Jewish community have communicated to me their concern about rising anti-Semitism. The Jewish community has my full support in combating prejudice and discrimination. There needs to be an unambiguous message from all levels of society about racism. 

'Where there isn't, extremists can start to believe that they may have licence to express their racial hatred. We can’t be complacent. When it is given the opportunity, racial vilification can escalate to racial violence,' the statement finished.

Also accusing Jewish people of pumping 'anti European values' and 'drug abuse', the flyer invited people 'with an open mind' to join them.

On Squadron 88's Facebook page just over a week ago there was a call out for members who could help hand out leaflets around their suburb so long as the distributed a 'minimum of 500'.

Federal MP for Wentworth, Malcolm Turnbull said on his website that those responsible for the leaflets were guilty of 'un-Australian behaviour'.

'These leaflets seek to undermine the security and the harmony of Australia and hence of all Australians,' he said.
