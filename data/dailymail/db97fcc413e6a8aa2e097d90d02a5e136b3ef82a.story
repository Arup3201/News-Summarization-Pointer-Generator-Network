When Apple's new iPad tells you that it has 100% battery, it isn't always telling the truth.

The gadget starts to say that it is 'full' when it's at 90% - a difference that can cost users 1.2 hours' usage.

The reason, says ZDNet, is that the formula used to calculate when the device is 'full' is slightly out - a safety mechanism used by Apple to prevent people overcharging their gadgets.

The battery in the new iPad is 1.7 times bigger than the one in iPad 2 - and the difference means the new gadget misreports whether it is fully charged or not

All iPhones, iPads and iPod Touches misreport whether they are full - albeit at a slightly higher level around 97%, ZDNet claims.

But with the new iPad's enormous battery capacity - 1.7 times bigger than iPad 2 - the slight difference in the formula used to calculate when it is 'full' makes a noticeable difference to the battery life.

Ray Soneira of monitoring firm DisplayMate says that the difference is measurable on the new iPad.

The display gives a claimed battery life of 10.4 hours, whereas the real figure is 11.6 hours - and the difference can leave users thinking the device is fully charged when in fact it's not.

Soneira also claims that users who attempt to charge new iPad while using it could be in for a surprise - it can take up to 20 hours.

Apple's iPad uses a much larger amount of power than its predecessor, largely due to the demands of its Retina screen

The problem should be easily fixable via
a software download - often used by Apple to fix battery glitches and 
other teething difficulties with gadgets.

His measurements lend weight to earlier complaints on Apple forums that the device has shorter 
battery life and painfully long charging times.

DisplayMate claims that the huge increase in power demands is due to the density of pixels on the new screen.

The LED backlight needs a huge amount of power just to shine through the high density of transistors in the panels.

‘The
power consumption of the LEDs is 2.5 times that of iPad 2, and the 
battery is 1.7 times larger - if you run your new iPad at full 
brightness, the battery run time is less because you only put in 70 
percent more battery but you're using 150 percent more power,’ Raymond 
Soneira of Displaymate said in an interview with CNET.
