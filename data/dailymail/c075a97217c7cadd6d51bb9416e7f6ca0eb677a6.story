Yemen's embattled president, looking weakened and stiff, has made his first public appearance since he was injured in a blast on his palace compound last month, in an apparent bid to dispel growing speculation about his condition.

President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who is undergoing treatment in Saudi Arabia, lashed out at opponents seeking to oust him from power, but his dramatically changed appearance belied his show of defiance.

White plaster casts covered his arms and hands, and his face appeared noticeably darker and thinner than before the attack. He sported a short beard and his hair was covered with a red-and-white-checkered Arab headdress cloth, both unusual for the clean-shaven, suit-wearing leader.

In a pre-recorded video statement broadcast on Thursday, Saleh said he'd undergone more than eight ‘successful operations,’ but did not say if and when he would return to Yemen.

The leader of Yemen's ruling party, who is close to Saleh, said the president's brief speech helped set the record straight. ‘His mere appearance on TV has clarified things for people and silenced many tongues by showing that the president is in good health,’ said the politician, Yasser Yemani.

However, Mohammed al-Thahiri, a protest leader in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa, said Saleh's career is over. ‘It's clear form the way that he looks that he can't come back. This man is no longer able to rule the country,’ said al-Thahiri.

Wearing a white robe and sitting rigidly in an armchair, Saleh accused ‘terrorist elements’ of carrying out the June 3 attack. He said dialogue is the only way out of the political crisis that has brought this impoverished corner of the Arabian Peninsula to the brink of civil war.

‘Where are the conscious people? Where are the honest people? Where are the believers and the men who fear Allah? Why don't they stand with dialogue?’ he said. ‘They should stand with dialogue so we can find solutions.’

‘Many have understood democracy incorrectly, through incorrect practices,’ Saleh said in the seven-minute video recorded in Saudi Arabia and broadcast on Yemen state TV.

He accused his opponents of practicing the politics of ‘hijacking’ and ‘arm-twisting’ while describing himself as a defender of democracy and stability.

‘We love participation, though the constitution, though the law,’ he said.Saleh did not mention the U.S.-backed proposal by Yemen's powerful Gulf Arab neighbors that would see him transfer power in exchange for immunity from prosecution.

Before his injury, Saleh repeatedly refused to sign the proposal.

More than four months of popular uprising seeking to end his rule have battered Yemen's economy, spread instability and caused the United States to turn away from Saleh, once considered a key ally in fighting Yemen's active al-Qaida branch. Many worry al-Qaida could exploit instability in Yemen to expand its operations.

Illustrating the threat, security officials said Thursday that Islamist fighters killed 10 Yemeni soldiers execution-style after stopping their bus at a fake checkpoint. Wednesday's attack was carried out in the southern province of Abyan, where militants have already seized control of two towns.

In the capital Sanaa, the crackle of gunfire rang out when Saleh appeared on TV, as security forces and Saleh supporters fired in the air. Sanaa protest leader Abdel-Hadi al-Azazi said a small explosion went off in the public square where protesters have camped out injured six people. Its cause remained unclear.

Syria today said that the U.S. ambassador's unauthorised trip to the flashpoint city of Hama proves Washington has a hand in the troubles.

The strong statement comes as Syrians are expected to take to the streets across the country in a weekly show of defiance against President Bashar Assad's autocratic regime.

Hama, the site of a 1982 massacre by Assad's later father and predecessor, has become a focal point of the uprising and has drawn the largest crowds since the revolt began in mid-March.

‘The presence of the U.S. ambassador in Hama without obtaining prior permission from the Foreign Ministry as stipulated by instructions distributed repeatedly to all the embassies is clear evidence of the U.S. involvement in the ongoing events in Syria,’ the state-run news agency SANA reported Friday, citing an unnamed ‘official source’ at the Foreign Ministry.

Thousands of Egyptians took to the streets around the country today to demand justice for victims of Hosni Mubarak's regime and press the new, military rulers for a clear plan of transition to democracy.

There is growing frustration among Egyptians that little has changed five months after the 18-day uprising forced the former president to step down on February 11.

Riots and protests have been escalating over what many see as the reluctance of the military rulers, who took over after Mubarak, to prosecute police and former regime officials for the killing of nearly 900 protesters during the uprising.

The U.S. is trying to ‘aggravate the situations, which destabilise Syria,’ the statement said.

The central Syrian city poses a potential dilemma for Assad's government on Friday. A major offensive could make the city a fresh rallying cry for the opposition, but the regime also does not want a repeat of last Friday's stunning rally, when an estimated 300,000 people protested.

Ambassador Robert Ford traveled independently Thursday to Hama to show solidarity with residents protesting against Assad's regime, according to the State Department.

He also participated in a government-organised excursion to northern Syria last month.

State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Ford ‘spent the day expressing our deep support for the right of the Syrian people to assemble peacefully and to express themselves.’

Ford reached the city after passing checkpoints run by the military and Hama residents. Nuland said he met nervous residents and saw many shops closed. He also visited a hospital treating the wounded.
