A Russian banker who was shot six times in a failed assassination attempt in London has called on his home country to mount an 'honest' investigation into the attack - as he repeated his claim to know who was behind it.

German Gorbuntsov believes the hit was orchestrated by people with connections to the Kremlin.

He was speaking from his bed in an unnamed London hospital, where he is being guarded around the clock by a team of 20 armed police.

A lone assassin fired at the 45-year-old banker as he entered his flat on Byng Street in the capital's Docklands on March 20.

Mr Gorbuntsov, who is recovering after coming out of a coma, said he believed his former business partners were behind the shooting.

'I ask the authorities to be honest and to investigate what happened in a fair way,' Mr Gorbuntsov told the Independent.

'I want them to question me quickly, and hand over documents to Britain quickly.'

Scotland Yard detectives have dismissed suggestions that Russian authorities are being obstructive in the case, but have admitted there are no named suspects.

Mr Gorbuntsov suspects the investigation is being held up because the men he has named claim to be friends of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.

Critical: German Gorbuntsov was taken to hospital by ambulance after the attack

Speaking via a Skype internet 
connection set up from his lawyers' Moscow office, he said he had been 
interviewed repeatedly by British police but no one from Russia had 
questioned him.

'The
evidence I have is enough to put them behind bars,' he said. 'Of course
they have good connections, but I'd like to believe there is justice in
Russia.'

The banker had fled to London to hide from his former business partners and said nobody knew where he was living.

But he noticed he was being followed in the days before the shooting.

He did not see the man who fired at him.

Doctors have told Mr Gorbuntsov he will need to remain in hospital for up to three months, although his condition is stable.

The banker and his lawyers believe he was attacked because he was preparing to give evidence to Russian prosecutors about a botched assassination attempt on his former business partner, Alexander Antonov.

Mr Antonov, father of Vladimir Antonov, the former owner of Portsmouth Football Club, was shot in Moscow in 2009 but survived.

Mr Gorbuntsov first named the men he suspects of being behind the killing in an interview with the Mail on Sunday in April.

In that interview he recalled how he had just stepped out of a taxi and was punching in the entry code to his apartment block when his would-be assassin emerged from the shadows and opened fire.

He said: â€˜It had been an ordinary day and it was around 8pm when I got back home from my office in the City.

'I tapped in the code and when I got to the third digit I suddenly felt a terrible sharp pain in my stomach, and then another, and another.'

The case bears similarities with the poisoning of Russian intelligence agent Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006.

No one has been convicted of Mr Litvinenko's murder, which led to a cooling of relations between Britain and Moscow.
