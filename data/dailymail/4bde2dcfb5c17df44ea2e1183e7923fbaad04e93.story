It will go down as one of the quieter games of Joe Hart's international career but that didn't stop him being voted man of the match for England's 1-0 win against Estonia on Sunday evening.

The Manchester City keeper earned his second consecutive award following Thursday's comfortable 5-0 victory over minnows San Marino, another game where he was rarely tested.

But, perhaps poking fun at his lack of action for a second time in four days, Three Lions fans opted to pick Hart as Vauxhall's best player in an online vote for the Euro 2016 qualifier.

The 27-year-old received a massive 83 per cent of the vote, leaving him well ahead of second-placed Jack Wilshere (six per cent) and goalscorer Wayne Rooney (three per cent).

Hart made just one save and one catch in Tallinn, following on from the one save he made at Wembley on Thursday evening.

England's clean sheet means they have now kept five in a row for the first time since 2006 and are yet to concede a goal since Luis Suarez's late winner for Uruguay during the group stage of the World Cup.

As well as San Marino and Estonia, Roy Hodgson's side have since managed to keep out Costa Rica, Norway and Switzerland on their way to four wins from five games.
