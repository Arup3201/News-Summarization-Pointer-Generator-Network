Dogs, cats, horses, toasters: You name it, it has a Facebook page.

Facebook now has one billion users - but ten per cent of them are not human, according to new research.

At least 100 million of Facebook’s ‘monthly active users’ are pets, brands and companies - and even Facebook founder Mark Zuckeberg's dog Beast has a page.

According to eMarketer, an internet market research company, only 889.3 million of the one billion users are real people.

Quartz reports that Facebook claims it currently has 1.11 billion users but says that it will not actually reach this number of human users until 2014.

Currently the biggest growth in Facebook use is in India, Brazil, Russia, the Middle East and Africa.

Each of these regions is expected to see a 30 per cent increase in Facebook members this year.

In contrast, the U.S., UK and Western Europe are seeing a much slower growth in Facebook membership.

Facebook's investors are concerned teenagers are starting to lose interest in the site.

They worry people are developing 'Facebook fatigue' so are moving to sites such as Twitter instead.

The Financial Times reports that investors fear young people no longer think Facebook is 'cool' and that they are deserting it as their parents join the site.

The concerns are based on figures which show that 40 per cent of young Facebook users in the U.S. say that they expect to use the site less this year than they have in the past.

It is believed that the biggest challenge facing the social media site is gaining a foothold in the mobile market.

However, currently half of the population of the U.S. and the UK actively use Facebook but many of the users are less active than they were in the past.

In Western Europe as a whole only 37 
per cent of people actively use the social networking site because 
people in France, Italy and Germany are less enthusiastic.

eMarketer also predicts that Facebook use will grow from 42.6 per cent of internet users now to 54.7 per cent in 2017.

While
 46.6 per cent of people in North America and more than 30 per cent of 
people in Latin America and Western Europe will use Facebook at least 
once a month this year, the Middle East, Africa and Asia-Pacific will 
have much lower penetration rates, which brings down the worldwide 
percentage of the population using Facebook to 15.4 per cent.

eMarketer estimates that 63 per cent of social network users worldwide will access Facebook at least once a month in 2013.

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's dog, Beast, has its own page on the site - with 1.5m followers

In recent years, it has been common for users in countries such as China, Japan, South Korea and Russia to use local social networking sites as opposed to Facebook, which gives the site room for growth.

By 2017, Facebook users will account for 69.5 per cent of social network users worldwide.

Facebook is about to celebrate the end of its first year as a public company but there are concerns among investors that teenagers are losing interest in it.

Some investors are worried that young people are developing ‘Facebook fatigue’ which is causing them to move to other social networking sites such as Twitter.

The Financial Times reports that investors believe teenagers no longer see Facebook as ‘cool’ and that the arrival of their parents on the site is causing them to defect.
