Team USA has a shot at medaling in the Men's Figure Skating competition with Jason Brown and his now-famous ponytail.

The 19-year-old placed sixth after his short-program routine today, and still has the chance to out-perform his competition and take the bronze with his long-program tomorrow.

Japan's Yuzuru Hanyu currently leads the competition and Russian legend Evgeni Plushenko pulled out after taking a fall in practice.

Brown, a native of Highland Park, Illinois, is optimistic he'll be on the medal stand come Friday.

Perfect: American Jason Brown of Highland Park, Illinois skated a flawless short-program routine Thursday at the Olympics in Sochi

Bronze contender: Brown was in sixth place at the end of the short-program day. He still has a chance to medal if he outperforms his competition in the long-program on Friday

Anchor: Brown will be the last to perform in Friday's long-program competition

Team player: Brown helped the U.S. win bronze in the team skating competition

'All year in this program, in every competition I have gone to, I have gotten a personal best,' Brown said. 'I didn’t want to stop in the Olympics.'

Brown will be the last to perform in the long-program Friday.

Brown skated a flawless short program at Sochi today, in his Olympic debut.

In the end he scored a high 86, putting him just margins of a point away from Javier Fernandez of Spain in third, Daisuke Takahashi of Japan in fourth and Peter Liebers of German in fifth.

Brown's going to have to skate a near-perfect routine if he wants to medal since he doesn't a quad jump like the top-tier of the competitors.

Tactic: Brown will have to skate perfectly and count on his competition messing up if he wants a shot at the medal stand since he doesn't perform quad jumps

His teammate Jeremy Abbott attempted a quad today with not so spectacular results.

Abbott took a spectacular tumble on the ice after attempting a quad jump and lay in pain for 10 seconds as the music continued to play - before pulling himself up, rubbing his hip and
 gliding back into the center of the ice.

Applause erupted for the 28-year-old when he finished and raised his arms confidently with a smile.

Smack: Abbott, who has already won a bronze in the group event, smashed onto the ice during the trick

Crash landing: Abbott slides across the ice after his spectacular fall with a grimace of pain on his face

Smash: The 28-year-old crashed into the boards and grabbed his hip while howling in pain

Ignoring his coaches who had rushed to his aid, he took off again - finishing the rest of the routine with ease. He landed a triple lutz-triple toe combination followed by a spin and a triple axel.

As the crowd cheered, Abbott appeared surprised at his feat, and scored a surprising 72.58 - pushing him to first place and allowing him to qualify, although 20 skaters were yet to perform.

After his performance, he told reporters about his determination to finish, the Washington Post reported.

'The second I stood up and all of the audience was screaming, I was like, "I'm finishing the program; I don’t care if I’m two minutes late. I don’t care what happens with the rest of it. But I’m getting up and not going to give up this moment!!' he said.

He's up! Abbott limps away from the boards - his face creased with pain - but he is determined to carry on

'As much of a disappointment as this is, I'm not ashamed. I'm not in the least bit ashamed. I stood up, and I finished that program. And I'm proud of my effort, and I’m proud of what I did under the circumstances.'

At the end of the short program day, Abbott was in 15th place. He will appear in the free skate on Friday.

His fall on Thursday was just another example of the struggles Team USA has faced in Sochi - including surprise losses, injuries and complaints about the conditions.

Fighter: Both Russian and American spectators broke into applause as Abbott finished up his routine

Johnny Weir, a former US skater who is
 working as a commentator for NBC in Sochi, expressed his doubt at the 
strength of the skating team this year.

'From
 a numbers perspective, the Grand Prix final is the biggest pre-Olympic 
even where skaters from all over the world come together and are 
competing against one another... and before the Vancouver Olympics, 
there were three American men in those final six,' he said.

'This
 season we weren't even that close to having a shot at going to the 
Grand Prix final for even one (male) skater. From a numbers standpoint, 
most likely this is the weakest team we've had in a long time at the 
Olympics.'
