Senior Ukip insiders are furious at the way an alleged affair between its general secretary and a high profile candidate has been played out in public.

Roger Bird and Natasha Bolter have revealed intimate details of meetings, dinners and texts at the centre of claims he behaved improperly as a party official.

In a series of interviews there have been claims and denials over whether the pair ever had sex, which one Ukip source warned has left them ‘both look like f***king prats’.

Ukip candidate Natasha Bolter and Roger Bird have both given interviews making allegations about their relationship since he was suspended over allegations of impropriety as general secretary

In a shock announcement on Monday evening, Ukip announced Mr Bird had been suspended while it investigated allegations of 'impropriety'.

On Tuesday Mrs Bolter gave an interview claiming to have been the victim of sexual harassment.

Mr Bird has said the pair were in a relationship. Mrs Bolter told the BBC’s Newsnight: ‘I didn’t sleep with Roger Bird, end of.’

But he insisted: ‘For the record, yes she did.’

Senior Ukip figures are understood to be infuriated at the way both sides have chosen to ‘air their laundry in public’.

A source told MailOnline: ‘It would be better if they kept it private. Both of them now look like f***ing prats.’

But friends of Mr Bird today hit back at the party hierarchy, saying Ukip itself had made the issue public by releasing a press statement about the disciplinary process.

‘It’s a bit rich for senior people in the party to be attacking Roger over this,’ said one. ‘It was Ukip who put this in the public domain with a press release. This should have been a strictly confidential process, and if it had been left to Roger it would have been.

‘But he was suddenly facing a very public allegation which he had to respond to.’

Doubts have been cast on Mrs Bolter’s account of events, particularly why she continued sending Mr Bird affectionate text messages after the date she claimed to have raised concerns about him.

It also emerged she lied about studying politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford University in the 1990s.

December 8: Mr Bird’s suspension becomes public. Ukip says: ‘The party has acted swiftly and decisively and will not tolerate impropriety of any kind amongst its staff’

Ukip has repeatedly insisted it is trying to carry out a professional disciplinary investigation into Mr Bird’s conduct.

And it stresses that the issue of whether or not the couple slept together is not central to the investigation.

‘There are still questions to answer. He is still under our complaints procedure. We are trying to ensure that our procedures are watertight,’ the source added.

There are claims he ‘marked up’ Mrs Bolter after her interviewing her about her suitability to be a candidate to ensure she made it on to the approved list.

The row erupted when the religious education teacher accused Mr Bird of ‘taking her down to the snooker room’ at a club after a dinner in London and propositioning her on the day he interviewed her as a prospective candidate.

But he responded by revealing a string of intimate text messages he claimed she had sent him – including one which read: ‘I love you and miss you and think you are sort of perfect.’

He insisted the messages proved that, far from sexually harassing her, the pair had actually been in a ‘consensual’ relationship.

But Mrs Bolter, 39, responded furiously to his claims, accusing him of lying and insisting: ‘I did not sleep with Roger Bird – end of.’

But she admitted there were text messages. In an interview with BBC Two’s Newsnight, recorded before Mr Bird releases the content of texts, she said: ‘There are texts between us.’

Asked if they were of an ‘intimate nature’ she replied: ‘No.’

She added: ‘Often I send a kiss after a text… you know like: see you later kiss kiss…I think that’s a girl thing to do. But I don’t think it is particularly intimate.’

One text message, which Mr Bird claimed was sent by Mrs Bolter on November 2, said: 'I love u bird and wish u let me look after u. Hope u feel better xx.'

It has also emerged that she was still texting the party’s general secretary her 'love or infatuation' a week after an investigation was launched.

Mrs Bolter claims she raised he concerns with the party on November 5.

But it is understood that the investigation was triggered by another party member raising concerns about Mr Bird’s handling of the candidate selection process on that date.

The party contacted Mrs Bolter was contacted on the same day, but only met David Soutter, Ukip’s head of candidates, on November 11.

Labour defector Natasha Bolter quit UKIP claiming she was sexually harassed by a senior official

Mr Bird released details of text messages (some pictured above) to try to clear his name, but Ukip officials fear it is damaging the party by dragging private messages into the public domain

On Monday night Ukip announced that, after an internal inquiry, Mr Bird had been suspended ‘following allegations of impropriety’.

Mr Bird told The Telegraph: 'I am going to make my case. Everything I am saying is backed by emails and text messages. There are plenty of emails and text messages between us which how it was a consensual relationship with interest on both sides.

'I have done nothing wrong. I am a single man, she is also single, we are both single people who conducted a consensual relationship outside the office.

'I'm very sorry that a story like his should have arisen because it detracts from our [Ukip's] central messages. The party had to respond in a formal way and conduct an appropriate investigation.'

It is thought Mrs Bolter also has emails between the pair which could be made public in the coming days.

When asked who out of her and Mr Bird was ‘lying big time’ about the nature of their friendship, Mrs Bolter hesitantly replied: ‘I think he… well I know he is lying ... I did not sleep with Roger Bird, end of.’

A Ukip pokesman refused to comment on the ongoing publicity battle, or the details of the case. He said: ‘We have an investigation about allegations of impropriety.’
