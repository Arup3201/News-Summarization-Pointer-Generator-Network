Beleaguered Labour leader Ed Miliband asked former Home Secretary Alan Johnson to return to the shadow cabinet – but was turned down.

Mr Johnson said he was approached by the Labour leader earlier this year but turned down the offer of a new frontline role.

‘Ed said to me a few months ago 'I suppose you're not interested in coming back?' I said 'No'.

Former home secretary Alan Johnson has revealed that he was sounded out by Ed Miliband about a possible return to Labour's top team

Mr Johnson has previously ruled himself out as a contender for the Labour leadership, despite pressure from MPs who believe they would stand a much better chance in next year's general election if he replaced Mr Miliband.

He insisted the party could win in May, despite Mr Miliband's dismal poll ratings, and said he had told the Labour leader he would be happy ‘to go round the country, campaigning, talking to parties’ during the election.

But Mr Johnson, in an interview with Alastair Campbell for GQ magazine, indicated he could even be tempted back to the frontbench if Labour succeeded in regaining power.

‘Disgracefully - and it is disgraceful because I won't have done the heavy lifting - then I would be more interested. But I am not gagging for it,’ he said.

Since standing down as shadow chancellor in 2011 after discovering his wife was having an affair with his police protection officer, Mr Johnson has carved out a successful second career as a writer, penning two best-selling volumes of his autobiography.

He said he had been surprised when Mr Miliband offered him the post of shadow chancellor after becoming leader in 2010 and admitted that he had not enjoyed the job.

‘I was glad to get out. I took it because I thought, what an extraordinary gesture, that he wants me there. I was not associated with him (Mr Miliband), I'm very much a Blairite, I had not been planning to go on the front bench. But my heart wasn't in it,’ he said.

‘I was not up for it. I did it for seven months but I didn't like the job.’

Ed Miliband, giving a speech in Glasgow last week, was under pressure from MPs concerned about the party's poor polling - many of whom wanted Mr Johnson to replace him as Labour leader

Mr Johnson expressed exasperation that Labour had not been more effective in attacking Chancellor George Osborne over the economy and urged Mr Miliband to make ‘a couple of big speeches ... just taking the whole thing apart’.

‘If I feel frustrated about anything it is about not holding George Osborne to account, because his flagship policy was to clear the deficit in one term. He has totally failed,’ he said.
