Alastair Campbell, former Labour spin doctor and Tony Blair's one time 'right hand man', is to return to politics in a bid to help the party win the 2015 general election.

Mr Campbell will be brought in by party leader Ed Miliband, and will join a number of other New Labour figures - including former Health Secretary Alan Milburn - in returning to the frontline of party politics.

The move was revealed in a leaked memo outlining monthly meetings, and confirmed by a spokesman for Mr Miliband.

The Observer reports that the top-secret note came from campaign chief Douglas Alexander's office.

The reappointment of Mr Campbell will likely come as a surprise to Miliband's supporters.

During his leadership campaign he distanced himself from the New Labour policies and tactics which Mr Campbell pioneered, winning him the support of the unions and far left.

In a Total Politics interview in October, he criticised members of Mr Miliband's shadow cabinet for not having a higher profile, claiming they needed to show more 'energy and fight'.

The move by Ed Miliband (speaking as he launched the new Labour energy policy) was revealed in a leaked memo outlining monthly meetings, and confirmed by a spokesman

Mr Campbell also revealed he had been 
in regular contact with Mr Miliband, discussing subjects including his 
conference speech, in which he announced his flagship energy bills 
freeze.

Momentum is building up behind getting Gordon Brown to return to frontline politics to win support for the independence referendum.

There are fears that the Better Together campaign has no ‘fire in its belly’ and could end up being outfoxed by Alex Salmond’s nationalist

One Cabinet minister said: ‘We could be in real danger, we are not in any way complacent about this. The independence side have an easier sell.’

The source said there was even talk of the former Prime Minister Mr Brown being brought ‘out of self-imposed exile’ to lead the campaign.

‘We have to remember he is more popular in Scotland than he is in the rest of the country. But God help us if it takes Gordon to win the referendum.’

Labour’s own anti-separation campaign, United with Labour, is using Mr Brown as its frontman.

Sources said he would be ready to play a starring role in the main campaign if called on to do so and has already spoken about the economic stumbling blocks for an independent Scotland.

Mr Campbell said 
during the conference season at both the Labour and Tory gatherings he 
was told he should get involved in the 2015 campaign.

During the interview, Mr Campbell said that he wanted Mr Miliband to take on critics who call him a 'geek'.

He said: 'For somebody to come up there and say, "you're a geek, you haven't got charisma", somebody to come on and say, "yeah, you speak quite well but you're not Tony Blair, you're no Barack Obama", he can then say, "no, I'm not Blair, I'm me; this is what I am.

'Okay, I might not be as charismatic as Barack Obama, but here's what I'm going to do with energy, here's what I'm going to do with this...".'

The memo also names a number of other New Labour advisers and said they will be consulted, including Ben Wegg-Prosser, Patrick Loughran, Matthew Doyle and DJ Collins.

Since his departure from Downing Street in September 2003, Mr Campbell has been working independently on public speaking, broadcasting, charity fundraising and writing his diaries.

He returned to politics briefly to advise both Mr Blair and Gordon Brown during Labour’s 2005 and 2010 election campaigns.

He is said to have inspired writers of BBC comedy The Thick of It to create Malcolm Tucker, a fictional formidable Number 10 adviser.
