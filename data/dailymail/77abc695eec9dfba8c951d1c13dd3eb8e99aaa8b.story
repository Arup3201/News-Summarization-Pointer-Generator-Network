Happy couple: Professor Green and Millie Mackintosh have announced that they are engaged

They said it wouldn’t last. After all, she was an heiress brought up in the lap of luxury and he was a boy from the wrong side of the tracks.

But Millie Mackintosh and Professor Green are clearly determined to prove the doomsayers wrong.

After a 15-month romance, they have announced their engagement.

Miss Mackintosh, 23, whose family are behind the Quality Street confectionery empire, is to marry Stephen Manderson, the 29-year-old rap star best known as Professor Green.

While Manderson grew up on a tough East London council estate and is a former drug dealer, his glamorous fiancée was brought up in a £1.4million townhouse in Bath.

She now stars in the E4 reality television series, Made in Chelsea.

The couple began dating in December 2011, after he saw her picture on the cover of men’s magazine FHM and asked his publicist to put him in touch.

Their relationship was dismissed from the start, with many suggesting it was little more than a publicity stunt.

However, Miss Mackintosh has told how her parents Nigel and Georgina have been surprisingly supportive.

‘They thought he seemed kind and a great guy. They’re very accepting parents and they’re happy as long as I’m happy,’ she said.

Manderson has admitted: ‘Millie and I are from different places.’

But he added: ‘It doesn’t make that much difference to us. If the difference was race or we were a gay couple, they probably wouldn’t be as quick to point the difference out. But because it’s class, it’s fair game.

‘That’s still prejudice. You’re effectively calling me a commoner – which I am, common as muck. But I’m doing all right for myself, and I’m well-mannered, I’m courteous.’

He grew up on a council estate in Hackney and his teenage parents split shortly after he was born.

His father, Peter, killed himself in 2008. Miss Mackintosh’s great-great-grandfather John was the self-proclaimed ‘Toffee King of England’, who created Mackintosh’s, one of Britain’s best-loved confectionery companies, in 1868.

A generation later, her great-grandfather Harold and his brother Douglas took over the firm and invented Quality Street in 1936.

The company was taken over by Nestle in 1988 in a deal worth almost £3billion.
