Steve Bruce may sympathise with Alan Pardew's pressurised position at Newcastle but the Hull manager still hopes to use it to his advantage when the sides meet on Saturday.

The timing of Bruce's arrival at St James' Park could not be more awkward for all concerned, with the boyhood Newcastle fan touted as a possible replacement for Pardew should the axe fall.

Significant fan protests are expected and Pardew himself has predicted 'mass hysteria'.

Hull City boss Steve Bruce knows his side must capitalise on the turmoil at Newcastle on Saturday

Bruce experienced similar times at neighbouring Sunderland and would not wish them on a fellow boss but admits he is hoping to take a 'mercenary' advantage of the situation.

'I know what he's going through after being in the North East and it's not easy. It's not an easy place to manage,' he said.

'You genuinely feel for the manager in charge and at this moment (Pardew is) under the hammer, after only four games.

A section of Newcastle supporters make their feelings know, printing thousands of 'sack Pardew' posters

Newcastle fans are becoming increasingly frustrated with Pardew's tenure, displaying several banners

'We all understand it's a results based business but some of the nonsense that goes with it, I have to say is ridiculous.

'Unfortunately with the way social media is and the way the media is there is a huge appetite for what we call nonsense. It comes with the territory but you have to say in the North East it seems to quadruple: when there's a crisis, there's a crisis, and I suppose that comes from the huge support they have got.

'It's a difficult, difficult place to manage. But we have to try and take advantage of that, of course we do. We have to be mercenary enough to try and do that.

'The other stuff is not enjoyable to watch from afar. Over the years he's done a decent job has Alan but I think that's the nature of the beast, especially in the North East, and I can say that because I'm from there.'

Bruce, instructing Newcastle loanee Hatem Ben Arfa, sympathises with Pardew's deteriorating situation
