These are the Albanian gang members who set up a cocaine hotline for drug addicts, earning more than £4million from 100,000 calls in just one year.

The unprecedented operation, dubbed ‘Mario Line’ by police, capitalised on the rocketing figures of users in Hertfordshire and north west London.

Harrow Crown Court heard this week how the gang, led by Besnik Sinanaj - known as Mario - ran a round-the-clock service for callers desperate for the class A drug, sold at £40-£50 a gram.

Besnik Sinanaj, known as Mario (top left), took 99,000 drug users' calls from his home in Falmouth, Cornwall, on the specially-made 'Mario Line'. He then relayed the order to his team of nine, including convicted suppliers Brezar Culaj (centre), Brigal Culaj (top right), Claudio Surluceanu (bottom left), and Fation Sinanaj (bottom right)

Between May 2012 and May 2013 a staggering 99,000 phone calls were made to the number.

But detectives investigating the ring tracked down Sinanaj, 35, at his home in Falmouth, Cornwall, in April 2013.

Three weeks later, on May 8, more than 160 police officers involved in Operation Pagoda busted a string of addresses during dawn raids.

Yesterday, the 10 main players were sentenced to more than 40 years in prison, with Sinanaj alone jailed for 10 years.

Detective Chief Inspector Mike Trotman, of Herts Police, said: 'The Mario Line was one of the most organised and prolific drugs lines to have operated in west Hertfordshire and I am pleased that we have dismantled this and the majority of those involved in its operation are now in prison.

'Hertfordshire remains one of the safest counties in the country and I want to send a clear message to anyone involved in drug crimes that we will use every power available to us to build intelligence, carry out warrants and bring offenders to justice.'

The 10 jailed all pleaded guilty to suppling cocaine.

Alongside Sinanaj, the judge convicted Brezar Culaj, 30, and Brigal Culaj, 31, to six years eight months behind bars.

Fation Sinanaj, 27, and Reoland Sinanaj, 34, were sentenced to five years and four months, while Sajmir Xhakrosa, 35, will serve four years six months in prison.

London-based Claudiu Surluceanu, 26, Ibadula Genghiz, 43, Adrian Spulber, 33, and Grigore Scripcaru, 31, were all handed 20-month sentences.
