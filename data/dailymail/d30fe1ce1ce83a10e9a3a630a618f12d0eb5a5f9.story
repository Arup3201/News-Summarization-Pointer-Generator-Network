'He's kicking her a*s': This footage of Lisa Harnum filmed by her fiancé and alleged killer Simon Gittany at the gym has emerged

New footage of a ballerina, who was 'thrown from a balcony to her death by her fiancé,' has emerged showing him encouraging her trainer during a tough gym workout.

Simon Gittany, 37, is heard saying 'he's kicking her a*s' in the video of his alleged victim Lisa Harnum, 30, which he filmed on his mobile phone.

Miss Harnum fell 15 storeys to her death from the balcony of an apartment she shared with Gittany in Sydney, Australia.

Gittany is accused of her murder.

The new video presented as evidence in Gittany's trial shows the dancer being 
encouraged by her trainer to do to lunges with weights as Gittany looks 
on saying, 'come on bub, do it for me'.

Gittany has pleaded not guilty to murdering his Canadian-born fiancée,
claiming he was trying to save her from suicide before she fell to the 
footpath 150-feet below on the night of July 30, 2011.

It
has also been revealed the 30-year-old's terrifying last moments were 
captured on the very pin-hole camera Gittany set up to spy on her every 
move. She is seen grappling with her 'controlling and abusive' fiancé.

Miss Harnum was allegedly heard yelling, 'please help me, God help me' as she fought for her life on the balcony before she fell.

Gittany has been regularly accompanied to his trial by his current girlfriend.

Pushing her: In the footage, Gittany is heard saying 'he's kicking her a*s' and 'come on bub, do it for me' as Miss Harnum's trainer puts her through her paces at the gym

A neighbour, however, claims he saw a topless man 'fist-pumping' on the terrace after something had gone over the edge, 9News reported.

Another witness walking past 
The Hyde apartment block in the heart of the city told police he saw a 
topless man holding what appeared to be black luggage horizontally over 
the balcony before it fell to earth.

'Of course, it was not a piece of 
luggage, it was Miss Harnum wearing black clothing,' Crown prosecutor 
Mark Tedeschi QC said today at Gittany's murder trial.

'God help me': Lisa Harnum (right) was allegedly heard screaming as she fought for her life on the balcony before she fell from the 15th floor of an apartment she shared with Gittany (left) in Sydney, Australia in 2011

Gittany was so jealous, Mr Tedeschi claimed, that he had banned her from seeing friends, 
forbade her from taking a job as a hairdresser and even hired a personal
trainer to come to their home so she wouldn't go to the gym where he 
thought she would be ogled by other men.

Describing Gittany as 'controlling and abusive', Tedeschi said he made her become Catholic, do her hair and dress exactly how he told her.

'[He believed] it was her function in life to submit to his will as the male in the relationship,' Mr Tedeschi said.

Terror: His hand clamped over her mouth to stifle her 'bone-chilling' screams for help, a shirtless Simon Gittany wrestles fiancee Lisa Harnam - minutes before she plunged 15-storeys to her death. The footage was captured on a pin-hole camera that he set up in the flat to spy on her

But his vice-like grip over her life was still not enough, the court heard. Mr Tedeschi told jurors Gittany even set up a network of mini cameras around the apartment to keep tabs on her and secretly read her emails and text messages.

It was because of this forensic 
campaign of surveillance that he caught wind of her plan to leave him 
with the help of two friends, the court heard. As a result he allegedly 
abused one of them over the phone, advising them to stay away.

At court: Gittany, 37, denies murdering Canadian-born Miss Harnam on July 30, 2011, claiming he was trying to stop her from jumping

In
the months leading up to her death, the court heard, Miss Harnum had 
become so fearful of her fiancé's jealous rage that, when she did 
venture outside, she only ever stared at the ground or into his eyes for
fear he might accuse her of looking at other men.

'The deceased's confidence became more and more diminished,' Mr Tedeschi said.

Giving evidence, Miss Harnum's 
mother said told the court: 'She told me he was always very controlling 
and wanted to always know where she was, what she was doing, who she was
with, what she was wearing.'

She
said when Miss Harnum plucked up the courage to tell Gittany she was 
leaving him, he threatened to destroy her chances of getting permanent 
Australian residency - a dream she had harboured since moving to the 
country.

Gittany's defence barrister Philip 
Strickland SC said Miss Harnum was a 'conflicted, complicated and 
confused woman' prone to over-reacting when she didn't get her own way.

Mr
Strickland said Gittany only monitored her text messages via a computer
programme because she had told him she had a secret that she couldn't 
disclose to him.

'The secret ate into their relationship,' he said

Her fingerprints were not found 
on the glass or metal rail of the balcony onto which he said she climbed
before she fell.
