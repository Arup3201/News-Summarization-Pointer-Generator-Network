Mathilda Vazille, 13, is in a coma after being hit by a car and flung into wall in Sydney's northern beaches on Saturday

A teenage girl thrown metres into a brick wall after being hit by a car at a notorious accident hotspot in Sydney's northern beaches is in a coma.

Mathilda Vazille, 13, was hit by a car while crossing Warringah Rd, Narraweena just after 7pm on Saturday - the same intersection where model Samantha Harris' fiancé hit and killed a 78-year-old grandfather while speeding.

According to witnesses, the teenager was trying to cross at the intersection of Alfred St when she was hit by a vehicle, which was overtaking, reported The Daily Telegraph.

Some residents including Kim Usai reported hearing a loud bang before running to help the young teenager  until paramedics arrived at the scene.

Ms Usai rushed to scene where Mathilda was lying against the front wall of her house after hearing the accident.

'Everyone was around helping her so I gave her a blanket to keep her warm,' she said.

Ms Usai said residents were accustomed to accidents at the notorious intersection.

Shortly afterwards police and paramedics arrived and Mathilda was flown to Royal North Shore hospital in a ­critical condition.

The corner of Alfred Street and Warringah Road, in Narraweena is considered an accident hotspot by residents and is the same intersection where model Samantha Harris' boyfriend Luke William Hunt smashed into a ­Hyandai Lantra, killing a 78-year-old man two years ago

On Saturday night she had surgery before being transferred to Sydney Children’s Hospital in Randwick on Sunday, where she remains in a coma.

The driver of the vehicle was taken to hospital and underwent mandatory blood and alcohol tests.

After news of the accident, emotional friends of Mathilda have said they are praying for her to recover and described her as caring and considerate.

While making his way home from the movies on Saturday night, friend Sam Edgley heard about an accident in the neighbourhood and texted Mathilda in fear it was her who had been hit.

Pray for Matilda: Friends are rallying behind the young teenager and hoping for a speedy recovery

'We were all worried because we knew Mathilda was in Narraweena but we thought these things are on the news all the time, it won’t be her,' he said.

'I sent a text to her and she didn't reply and then I started worrying. I'm still in shock, I don't really want to believe it.'

On Sunday, school friends have used to Facebook ­to asking the community to pray for Mathilda.

Others posted they were hoping for a speedy recovery.

The accident happened at the same notorious intersection where model Samantha Harris' boyfriend Luke William Hunt smashed into a ­Hyundai Lantra two years ago, which killed a 78-year-old man.

Investigations into Saturday's accident are ongoing and police ask anyone with information about the crash on Saturday to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
