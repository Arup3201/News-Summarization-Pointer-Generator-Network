Kate and Gerry McCann's pain over the disappearance of their daughter was 'multiplied 100 times' by a book by a former Portuguese police chief, a court has heard.

Gerry McCann's sister Trish Cameron said he and wife Kate had been left in 'purgatory' by the disappearance of Madeleine and claims that they were somehow involved.

Speaking at the libel trial of former police chief Goncalo Amaral, Mrs Cameron said the publication of his book in 2008 and a TV documentary based on it the following year caused the family to be 'vilified' and 'demonised'.

Hearing: Gerry McCann has also expressed a wish to testify against police chief Goncaro Amaral

Lawsuit: Mr McCann and his family are seeking £1million over claims they were responsible for Madeleine's disappearance

And she said Madeleine's twin siblings
 Sean and Amelie, now eight, told their parents that comments were made 
by fellow pupils at their school.

She told the court: 'My brother and sister-in-law live in purgatory because they have no end and they are looking for the truth.

'They would like an end but there is no end because they don't know what's happened.'

The
 McCanns say the former detective's claims in the book The Truth Of The 
Lie, including suggestions that they hid their daughter's body after she
 died in an accident and faked an abduction, damaged the hunt for 
Madeleine and exacerbated her family's anguish.

If
 successful in the legal action, brought against him, his publisher, and
 the makers of the documentary, the family stands to gain around £1 
million in damages.

Mrs 
Cameron, whose voice cracked as she described the effect on her family 
by the publication of the book, said: 'They were vilified in this book 
so their distress was multiplied 100 times.

'This pain was felt by all of their family because we still have a missing child and we knew that what is in there is not true.'

Proceedings: Mr McCann in the court building, where the case against Mr Amaral is being heard

Anger: Mr McCann claims the allegations made it harder to search for his daughter, who vanished in 2007

Earlier, Gerry McCann had arrived at the court in
 a bid to give evidence against the disgraced police chief, but later 
expressed his disappointment that he was not able to take part in the 
proceedings.

'Disappointed,' McCann told reporters as he left the courthouse, 'but you know, we'll keep going.'

It is not clear why he was not able to give evidence.

Mr McCann 
and his wife Kate are seeking £1million in damages from the former 
detective, claiming his allegations caused them extreme anguish and 
hindered the search for Madeleine, who vanished from a hotel room in the
 Algarve in May 2007.

In his book The 
Truth of the Lie, published in July 2008, Mr Amaral suggested that the 
couple hid their daughter's body after she died in an accident, then 
pretended she had been taken.

Mr
 McCann was left frustrated after flying to Portugal last week, when 
proceedings were adjourned because one of the defendant's lawyers could 
not be present.

Arriving at the Palace of Justice in Lisbon this morning, Mr McCann said he was not sure what would happen 'after last week'.

'We are here to listen to the judge and hopefully be heard,' he told reporters.

Battle: Mr McCann and his family are still looking for Madeleine, who was aged three when she disappeared

He travelled to the Portuguese capital with his sister Trish Cameron and his wife Kate McCann's mother Susan Healy, who are both expected to appear as witnesses in the case.

Mrs McCann attended the court last month on the first day of the case, telling reporters she was in Portugal to 'stop the damage' she believes is being caused to the search for her daughter.

The court has heard how she had suicidal thoughts after Mr Amaral claimed she had covered up her daughter's death.

Psychologist Alan Pike said that after the publication of the former police chief's book, Mrs McCann 'thought about not being around any more'.

Victim: Madeleine's disappearance sparked a worldwide police search, but she has not yet been found

Couple: Gerry and Kate McCann say they were extremely distressed by Mr Amaral's book, published in 2008

Madeleine, who was nearly four, disappeared from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz on May 3 2007 as her parents dined at a nearby restaurant with friends.

Mr Amaral, who initially led the inquiry into Madeleine's disappearance, was removed from the case in October 2007 after criticising UK police.

British detectives launched a fresh investigation into the child's disappearance in July this year and believe she could still be alive.

The Portuguese investigation into Madeleine's disappearance is officially closed.

The case, in which Mr Amaral denies defamation, is expected to finish hearing evidence in November.
