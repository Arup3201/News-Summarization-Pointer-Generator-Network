Prime Minister Tony Abbott has announced the government will ditch plans for the $7 Medicare co-payment.

Instead, an optional co-payment will be introduced at the same time the Medicare rebate to GPs is reduced by $5.

It will be up to doctors to decide whether their patients make up the difference or bulk bill them.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has announced he will dump his unpopular Medicare co-payment on visits to the GP

Incentives to bulk bill children under 16, concession card holders, pensioners and veterans will remain in place.

The new measures will come into place from July 2015. 

Mr Abbott said the move came after the government consulted with backbenchers, the public and crossbench senators who raised concerns over the co-payment.

He made the announcement, which passes the buck to doctors, with Health Minister Peter Dutton.

The government announced plans for the co-payment in the May budget, which would have seen all patients pay $7 upfront when they went to see their GP

Now it is up to doctors whether or not they will charged the optional and reduced $5 co-payment

The prime minister told reporters on Tuesday this change in policy would provide savings of $3.5 billion over the forward estimates compared to the previous one, which would save $3.6 billion. 

Mr Abbott said the new package had significantly improved the government's co-payment measures, while at the same time maintaining the desired price signal.

'But I do want to stress ... bulk billing stays for young people and for pensioners, and the co-payment is at the option of the doctor,' he said.

The government announced plans for the co-payment in the May budget, which would have seen all patients pay $7 upfront when they went to see their GP.

It was opposed by Labor, the Greens and crossbenchers in the Senate as well as doctors.

Australian Medical Association president Brian Owler has welcomed the policy change but said they would have to take a closer look at the specifics of the partial backflip by the government.

'I'm pleased vulnerable patients are being protected and that's something the AMA argues for,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

But Dr Owler did add that the onus had now been put on GPs and the more important issue was the freeze on medicare rebates.

He said Tuesday's announcement was a 'mixed bag' but it was a significant improvement on what was originally set out in the budget.

The decision to scrap the compulsory co-payment comes as Tony Abbott's popularity hits a new low.

Mr Abbott closed out the parliamentary year trailing Opposition Leader Bill Shorten as preferred leader by eight points on 39 per cent compared to 47 per cent, according to a Fairfax-Ipsos poll.
