Call-girl: Baronet's daughter Charlotte Colquhoun, pictured, is locked in a furious fight with the stables of multi-millionaire City boss Robin Geffen

Even for a man who plays the stock market for a living, giving a racehorse to a high-class call-girl was always going to be a bit of a risk.

And now the stables of multi-millionaire investment fund manager Robin Geffen are locked in a furious fight with aristocratic escort Charlotte Colquhoun over the fate of the once much-fancied King of Wands.

The horse, which belongs to Mr Geffen, was given to brunette Charlotte, 37, on the understanding that she would hack out on him and show him off in the ring.

She was also supplied with a full set of leather tack.

Mr Geffen made a payment of £2,000 in February to Charlotte for King of Wands’ upkeep.

But to the dismay of the City titan, whose Neptune Fund Management is valued at £85 million by The Sunday Times, the £140-an-hour prostitute has put the injury-prone King of Wands up for sale behind his back.

The gelding has been entered into an equine auction at Ascot on Tuesday.

She has put him up for sale as a wildcard (or late) entry. He is listed in the Brightwells Ascot Sales Catalogue at Lot 48.

Now Mr Geffen’s racing manager Charlie Liverton is begging Charlotte to give the horse back.

Last week Mr Liverton emailed Charlotte – who is a gifted rider – saying: ‘I am very sorry to see that the King of Wands has been given a wildcard entry into the Brightwells Sales at Ascot next week and wondered if there was anything we could do to help?

‘As you know, he was given to you so that you could show him in the ring and enjoy him on hacks, and we duly sent a full set of tack, including saddle, with him on the understanding that this was where his future lay. We are therefore slightly perturbed to see him in the Ascot sale.

‘Would you be able to advise as to why you are now having to sell him? Could we look at taking him back off your hands and find him another suitable home?

'Our worry, of course, is his injury and the fact that he might well end up back in a racing yard, which would only cause him harm. We would like to prevent that if it were at all possible please.’

But Charlotte – the illegitimate eldest daughter of old Etonian baronet Sir Malcolm Colquhoun – is adamant King of Wands is hers to sell.

‘I am selling King of Wands because of a change of circumstances,’ she told The Mail on Sunday from her home in a Herefordshire village.

‘I’m having a clean-out of stock and am getting some new horses in.’

Mr Geffen denied knowing Miss Colquhoun, claiming she was a ‘fantasist’. He later confirmed he made a payment of £2,000 to her for the upkeep of the horse.

King of Wands broke down in May 2012, and was sent to the Heart of Wales livery stable on February 7 this year. 

‘He went with a new set of tack and on February 8, I paid £2,000 to cover two years cost of stabling him. This is usual practice when placing retired, broken-down racehorses,’ Mr Geffen said last night.

Charlotte, who works as an escort under the pseudonym Charlie Foxtrot, is believed to have stabled the horse at the Welsh yard.

The mother of two was exposed this year as a prostitute who encouraged wealthy clients to enjoy her services by trading on her aristocratic lineage.

Her estranged father is a clan chieftain with 45,000 acres of land along the banks of Loch Lomond.

Charlotte, who was born to a girlfriend of the baronet before he was married, even posted a copy of the Colquhoun family crest alongside intimate pictures of herself on her Facebook page.

She took to prostitution to bankroll a luxury lifestyle and was unashamed to have been unmasked in the media earlier this year, saying her work as an escort enabled her to keep two retired racehorses, four spaniels and to spend her time enjoying country pursuits.

Mr Geffen, 56, who lives with his wife Camilla, 53, and two sons in a £2.5 million house near London’s exclusive Hurlingham Club, likes to maintain a low profile despite his substantial fortune.

He set up the Neptune Investment Management Fund in 2001 from an office in Hammersmith, West London, and it has expanded to employ 112 people and manage £6.25 billion worth of assets.

He sees horse racing as a relaxing hobby. ‘I have a high-pressure job and for the first five years after setting up Neptune, I had very little time. For me, though, a day’s racing is like a week’s holiday,’ he said.

‘I’m a pretty modest operator, I don’t lead a wild life and I work bloody hard. But going racing is a collective thing – we all get our pleasures from it in our different ways.’

Mr Geffen bought King of Wands, his first horse, in 2010 for an estimated £250,000 from breeder Philippa Cooper.

The seven-year-old gelding – a son of Derby winner Galileo – has won £67,744 in prizemoney but has failed to fulfil its potential after straining a tendon. He is expected to fetch up to £10,000 at auction.

Mrs Cooper is also distraught the horse is being sold, fearing his injury might see him sold for slaughter.

She said: ‘You would not know to look at him that he has had a serious injury. If you put a horse in the Ascot sale, it’s like the last-chance saloon. You have the meat men there.’
