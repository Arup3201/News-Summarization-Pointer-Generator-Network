If you want to play until you’re 35 then you’re not going about it in the best way by smoking and drinking.

If you want to have a top career you need to give yourself every opportunity to succeed, you want to take every advantage – even being one per cent better than your opposition.

One way of doing that is to live the life of a professional athlete and making your body as good as you can for as long as you can.

In the short term, smoking and drinking probably wouldn’t have a major effect on your body. It would be about the quantity and regularity of it.

If you smoke over a period of time then that’s not going to do you any good from a fitness point of view and it obviously increases the risk of lung disease.

It has a drip-drip effect. If you start young it’s going to have an effect by the time you’re 28 or 29. A sportsperson is no different to the man on the street, the effects are still the same.

It will damage the lungs and decrease the ability to breathe effectively.

With drinking it stays in your system even 48 hours afterwards, which will lead you to be more dehydrated and increase the likelihood of picking up soft tissue injuries if you train or play within that time.

If someone, particularly a sportsperson, is smoking or drinking on a regular basis then, it’s not rocket science, it’s not going to do them any good.
