Bed-blocking is bringing the NHS ‘to its knees’ with doctors unable to discharge more than 1,000 patients each day, a study reveals today.

The crisis has deepened due to a lack of available council-provided care for the elderly.

On one day this September, staff were unable to move 4,966 patients to another part of the NHS or into council care – the most since 2010.

That month, a total 138,068 ‘days of care’ were lost due to these delayed transfers, analysis by Sky News found. 

With bed places costing £250 a day, this suggests that NHS hospitals are wasting £34million a month on patients that should not still be there.

The number of ‘acute’ admissions unable to be transferred from beds that could have been used for accident and emergency wards was also found to have hit the highest level on record – meaning ambulances have nowhere to put incoming patients.

More than a quarter of the delays were attributed to a lack of social care. Funding for this has dropped significantly since the Coalition came to power, as councils look to cut costs.

The main reason cited for social care-related delays was ‘patients awaiting a care package in their own home’.

NHS chief Sir Bruce Keogh told Sky News that bed-blocking is a ‘major issue’. He added: ‘I was concerned about it as a practising surgeon, I’m concerned about it as a medical director.

'If you can’t get patients out of hospital and back into their own homes – where they’re safe and want to be – then the whole system backs up, you can’t treat people effectively in A&E, ambulances start to form queues at the front door.’

A recent survey by Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trust found 18 per cent of acute inpatient beds were occupied by someone who could have been moved on.

A&E consultant Dr Susan Robinson, from Addenbrooke’s Hospital, said: ‘If we’re crowded it’s because the hospital’s crowded, and the hospital’s crowded because they can’t get patients out. The crowded hospital is almost bringing us to our knees.’

Chris Hopson, chief executive of the Foundation Trust Network which represents hospital bosses, said: ‘We are going back downhill to 15 years ago, when the NHS was an international joke because you had to wait most of the day in an A&E department. Nobody wants to go back to that but you get what you pay for.’

Social care is provided at home and in the community by local authorities but, under pressure from the Government to cut costs, they have slashed budgets by around a fifth, or almost £3.5billion in total.

Andy Burnham, Labour’s health spokesman, said: ‘It is truly sad that record numbers of older people are trapped in hospital when they are well enough to be at home. Rather than rising to the challenge of the ageing society, we are going backwards and care is getting worse.’

A Department of Health spokesman said that even though the numbers of bed-blockers has gone up, the rate of delayed discharges as a proportion of hospital admissions has gone down.

‘The figures actually show that hospitals are discharging patients more quickly on average than at any time since the NHS started collecting this data,’ he said.

The number of senior nurses in the NHS has fallen by almost 3,400 since the election. New figures show there are now only 63,458 – down from 66,832 in May 2010. The Royal College of Nursing said: ‘Cutting senior nursing posts means that the NHS has lost vital experience and knowledge, built up over many years, at a time when it needs it more than ever.’
