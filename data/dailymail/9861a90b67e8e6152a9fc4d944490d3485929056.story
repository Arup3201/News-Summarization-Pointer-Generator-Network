When football fan James McDonagh sent off his application form to be the new manager of Blackburn Rovers, he just expected to have a funny story to tell his friends.

However the 30-year-old customer services manager, who supports arch-rivals Burnely, was left astonished when he received an email from the club promising him an interview.

Mr McDonagh, who admitted that his experience is limited to once coaching a Sunday league side and playing hours of computer game Football Manger, even wrote on his CV that he wanted to achieve 'back-to-back' relegation for the team, as he poked fun at the club’s current misfortunes.

True colours: Blackburn Rovers' global advisor Shebby Singh invited James McDonagh (above posing in a Blackburn shirt and with Burnley scarf) for an interview

But the hapless club were not to be put off and an email informing him he was 
in the frame to manage the Championship side was promptly sent by Shebby Singh, who
works for Blackburn's Indian owners Venky's.

Formally
inviting him for an interview, it read: 'Having checked your 
application and your credentials from your CV, we would like to 
shortlist you for the vacancy.'

Fired: Former Blackburn Rovers manager Michael Appleton last just two months at the club

Speaking to The Sun, Mr McDonagh said: 'They’re a bit of a joke club at the minute and I thought I could probably do better than their last few appointments.

'I wasn’t expecting to get shortlisted but Blackburn’s owners are known for their barmy decisions.'

In November 2010, Venky's London Ltd bought a 99.9 per cent stake in Blackburn Rovers.

The new owners spent £23million on the deal and took on around £20million of the club's debt.

However, their time in charge has been marked with controversy and frustration among supporters.

After
sacking Sam Allardyce as the club's manager, Steve Kean was put in 
charge, resulting in relegation from the Premier League at the end of 
the 2011–12 Premier League season.

Kean left the club in September last year and was replaced by former Blackburn defender Henning Berg but he was sacked on December 27.

Last week, the club dismissed his successor, Michael Appleton, after a two-month reign.
