Astronomers have been scrutinising high-definition photos of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko sent back by the Rosetta spacecraft.

And now a shortlist of five possible sites that could become the location for the first-ever landing on a comet, have been drawn up by the European Space Agency (Esa).

In mid-November, Esa intends to send down a robot laboratory named Philae, which will harpoon itself to the comet's surface and carry out a battery of scientific tests, the results of which astronomers hope will help them work out how planets formed.

A shortlist of five possible sites that could become the location for the first-ever landing on a comet, have been drawn up by the European Space Agency, Three of them are on the 'head' of the rubber-dusk shaped Comet 67P, while two are on its 'body' (illustrated)

Rosetta reached Comet 67P on August 6 after a 10-year chase through the Solar System to shed light on its surface.

Esa has now identified five ‘candidate’ zones for landing, but has says that ‘choosing the right landing site is a complex process’.

One final location will be selected, as well as a back-up. The topography must be relatively flat and clear and the surface stable.

There also has to be sufficient sunlight to recharge the lander's batteries beyond its initial 64-hour lifetime - yet not so much as to cause overheating.

At the same time, though, the site must offer the most potential to find scientific treasure.

Comet 67P comprises two lobes joined by a narrow neck, which make it look a little bit like a rubber duck in space.

The selection of five possible sites was informed by images of the rocky body, including this
 3D image of comet 67P, which can be viewed using stereoscopic glasses with 
red–green/blue filters. It was created by merging two images taken last 
week by the Rosetta probe as it circled around the comet

Rosetta also recently measured the temperature of the comet and determined that its average surface temperature is about -70°C (-94°F).

Although it may seem cold, that is actually 20 to 30°C (36 to 54°F) warmer than predicted for a comet at that distance, suggesting its surface will be quite dusty in addition to being icy.

'This result is very interesting, since it gives us the first clues on the composition and physical properties of the comet’s surface,' says VIRTIS principal investigator Fabrizio Capaccioni from Rome, Italy.

This suggests that much of the surface must be dusty, because darker material heats up and emits heat more readily than ice.

Three of the candidate sites are on the smaller lobe, or head of the 'duck,' and two are on the larger lobe, or the body, Esa said.

Comets are believed by astrophysicists to be ancient ice and dust left from the building of the Solar System around 4.6 billion years ago.

This cosmic rubble is essentially a time capsule - the oldest, least-touched material in our stellar neighbourhood.

It is hoped that understanding its chemical and physical composition will give experts insights into how the planets formed after the sun flared into light.

Rosetta is equipped with an array of sensors to help answer the question, but the biggest discoveries could be made by the 10 instruments aboard the 220lb (100kg) Philae lander.

The 2.5 mile (4km) comet is on a six-and-a-half-year orbit around the sun and is currently 324 million miles (522 million km) from the star.

For a sense of scale, it is about three times the size of Ben Nevis and Rosetta is the size of a car with 105ft (32 metre) wings.

At their closest approach on August 13 2015, the comet and Rosetta will be 114 million miles (185 million km) from the sun, meaning an eightfold increase in the light received from the sun compared with present levels, Esa said.

It took Rosetta two weeks before the spacecraft sent back its first detailed images of the comet’s rocky surface.

One image revealed a deep gorge in the centre and the comet's ‘head’, with parallel lines that look like cliffs. It also showed a cluster of building-sized boulders on the ‘neck’ of the comet.

This is an artist's impression of the Rosetta orbiter deploying the Philae lander to comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. After an extensive mapping phase by the orbiter between now and September, a final landing site will be selected for Philae to conduct in situ measurements in November

This
 image was taken on the 15 of August. It shows a cluster of 
building-sized boulders on the ‘neck’ region. In mid-November, Esa 
intends to send down
 a robot laboratory, Philae, which will harpoon itself to the comet's 
surface and carry out a battery of scientific tests

Three of the candidate sites are on the 
smaller lobe, or head of the "duck," and two are on the larger lobe, or 
the body, Esa said. This image shows the comet's ‘head’ os smaller lobe, with parallel linear features that look like cliffs

Taken on the 14th August, this image was taken from a distance of about 62 miles (100km) from the comet. Comets are believed by astrophysicists to
 be ancient ice and dust left from the building of the Solar System 
around 4.6 billion years ago

The Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research has released a 3D version of the comet, which appears to jump out of the screen if you wear stereoscopic glasses.

‘I was impressed that on the neck that connects the two parts of the comet there is something like the side of a mountain,' mission director, Paolo Ferri, told MailOnline.

'It's like looking at the Alps on a very high wall. It is incredible. It makes you feel like you want to climb it, and on one of the few areas that seem to be flat there are boulders 20 to 30 metres wide, they look like houses.’

Described as ‘the sexiest, most fantastic mission ever’, Rosetta will spend more than a year analysing the comet to help uncover the secrets to life on Earth.

The comet has been dubbed the ‘rubber duck’ in space and recent photos have revealed that its target, 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is actually what is known as a ‘contact binary’.

This means it is likely two comets stitched together, in what could turn out to be both a blessing and a curse.

It could have been fractured in the past or it could be two different objects that very slowly came into contact at speeds of a few metres per second.

This irregular structure makes it harder for scientists to calculate the comet's gravitational pull, to help steer the probe.

Rosetta recently measured the temperature of the comet and determined that its average surface temperature is about -70°C (-94°F).
