A global report last night made a blistering attack on the UK Government for its ‘evasion, denial and delays’ over establishing the truth about Britain’s complicity in torture.

There had been ‘no significant progress in holding those responsible to account’, said the group, which had reviewed human-rights abuses around the world.

In December, a US Senate intelligence committee revealed the most gruesome detail about the CIA’s torture programme, which included subjecting detainees at a network of secret jails to beatings, waterboarding, sleep deprivation and other forms of torture.

A detainee is escorted to an interrogation room at the Camp Delta detention facility at the U.S. Marine Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, which was linked to a network of secret jails where inmates were abused

Those detained included more than a dozen British residents, among them Shaker Aamer, 48, a father of four whose family live in South London. He has been held in Guantanamo Bay for 13 years without charge or trial.

Many of the detainees have claimed they were ill-treated with the knowledge of British agents.

MPs and campaign groups have insisted a judge-led investigation is needed to establish exactly what Britain knew – and if it fed questions to the CIA to ask the detainees.

But the Government has insisted that a probe by Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) will suffice. This is despite the fact the ISC has already cleared the UK of complicity in torture before, in a 2007 ruling.

Critics say the ISC does not have the powers to uncover the extent of the involvement and knowledge of the security and intelligence agencies and what former Labour ministers – including Tony Blair, Jack Straw and David Miliband – knew. And yesterday it was thrown into further disarray by the resignation of chairman Sir Malcolm Rifkind over the cash-for-access affair.

The Amnesty report says: ‘Several [European countries] hosted secret detention sites – Poland, Lithuania and Romania – or otherwise assisted the US government in the illegal transfer, enforced disappearance and torture and other ill-treatment of dozens of detainees, including in particular the UK, Sweden, Macedonia and Italy.

‘In none of these countries was there any significant progress in holding those responsible to account… Accountability continued to be undermined by evasion, denial and delays.’

Amnesty says that the UK ‘talks the talk on the global stage on human rights but this year’s summary shows they need to tend to their own garden’.

Its report heaps further pressure on the Government over the ongoing scandal of Mr Aamer’s imprisonment.

Condemning official ‘evasion, denial and delays’ over Britain’s complicity in torture during the Blair years, Amnesty International’s blistering report brings deep shame on our country.

Meanwhile, more than a dozen British residents languish in prison camps without trial – including Shaker Aamer, who has been held in Guantanamo Bay for 13 years.

Only when they are given justice, and the nation is told the truth about torture, can we begin to lift the stain.

Barack Obama last month promised David Cameron he would free Mr Aamer but so far no action has been taken.

He has been cleared for release but US officials are determined that he is sent not to Britain but to Saudi Arabia, despite serious concerns he could face torture there.

Other criticisms of the UK by Amnesty are likely to prove politically controversial, including an attack on new laws introduced in the UK to give the police and security services access to telephone records and electronic surveillance.

Amnesty International UK director Kate Allen said: ‘We should all be concerned about waking up in a surveillance state without having a proper public debate about it first.’

The report also calls for the five permanent members of the UN Security Council – Russia, France, US, China and Britain – to renounce their veto rights in cases of genocide and other mass atrocities.

It comes after the threat of the veto being exercised led to a failure by the UN to agree resolutions in Syria, Iraq, Gaza, Israel and Ukraine, despite ‘horrific crimes being committed against civilians by states or by armed groups’.
