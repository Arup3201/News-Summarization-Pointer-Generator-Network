A pair of Italian designers have come up with a rather ingenious way to keep your cookbooks free of sauce, flour and any other baking supply or byproductÂ  that could potentially end up covering a good meatloaf recipe: Tattoos.

Designers Marina Cinciripini and Sarah Richiuso have designed a collection of temporary tattoos that can be applied to a cook's forearm and act as guides for several classic Italian meals.

The duos slogan: 'Roll up your sleeves.'

Tats: Italian designers have created temporary tattoos that are recipes you can apply to your arm

Designers: Italian designers Marina Cincirpini and Sarah Richiuso created the tattoos for a design contest in 2013

Cinciripini and Richiuso initially designed the tattoos for a design competition in 2013. The pair came in second in that contest in the 'ritual' category.

'The project plays down traditional behavior, that of food preparation 
through cookbooks,' the pair says of their idea. 'Food conveying a message through the original use of
 the body, which becomes support of image guidance for the creation of a
 recipe.'

Some of the current recipes are for classic Italian meals like grandmother artichokes and spaghetti with dried tomatoes and anchovies.

Temporary: The tattoos come in packs of four that cost about $14 per pack

Traditional: Most of the recipes are traditional Italian cuisine like pastas with peppers and artichokes

The tattoos are currently available in four packs that cost about $14 a piece. The only downside is each tattoo is only for a single use - assuming the cook showers regularly, of course.

Cinciripini and Richiusoare are hoping to expand their fledgling business and are raising money for the venture on the crowd-funding site Eppela.
