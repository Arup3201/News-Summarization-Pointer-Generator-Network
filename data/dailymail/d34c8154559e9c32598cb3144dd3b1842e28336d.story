A rider is hurled across the bonnet of a 4x4 and a toddler is thrown from her pushchair as a horse wreaks havoc at a country fair.

The drama happened when the rider lost control of her mount and the terrified animal came just inches from trampling the little girl to death.

The rider, who managed to hold on to the reins, was left scrambling to protect the child as the rampaging horse stamped and bucked right next to her.

Horror at the country fair: The rider was sent flying into a pushchair when her horse charged into a crowd at the Dunster Country Fair

Terrifying: The sleeping child's buggy was upended and the startled toddler sent flying out of it when the rider was thrown off

Near-miss: The unseated rider landed next to the small child after being tipped onto the roof of a parked Land Rover during the drama at the Dunster Country Fair

Gilly Davidson was photographing the 
event at Dunster Castle, near Minehead in Somerset, when she spotted the
 black horse speeding off towards spectators, including children and 
pensioners in deckchairs.

She said: ‘It bolted towards the 
perimeter where the spectators were and threw the rider. She went over 
its head and on to the bonnet of a parked Land Rover.

‘Then she fell off into a pushchair 
with a sleeping child in it. The child  fell on to the ground while the 
horse was kicking and rearing just inches away from it.

Amazingly, no-one was injured in the incident, which took place at the 35th Dunster County Fair, an event popular with families.

Lucky escape: Astonishingly no-one was hurt in the dramatic incident at the country fair in Somerset on July 24
