The damaging effects of the recession have been blamed for the significant increase in the number of middle-aged men committing suicide, a charity has warned.

Latest figures have revealed the suicide rate among men aged between 45 and 59 years 
old increased between 2007 and 2011 by 8.5 per cent to 
22.2 deaths per 100,000 people - the highest level for a generation

Overall UK suicides hit 6,045 in 2011, according to the figures released by the Office for National Statistics, with deaths among men accounting for a majority of more than 4,550.

Driven to despair: An eight per cent rise in the number of UK suicides has been blamed on the effects of the recession

The increase was blamed on the recession by leading UK mental health charity SANE.

SANE chief executive Marjorie Wallace said: 'These figures reveal the profound human consequences of the economic downturn, in which unemployment, debt and the relationship breakdowns that often follow can push people who may be already vulnerable to take their own lives.

'It is worrying that the group most at risk should be middle-aged men who are not usually seen to be at risk.'

More than a quarter of men who took their own life in 2011 were aged between 35 and 55 according to the statistics, with the rate among men generally peaking at its highest for a decade with the female rate its highest for six years.

The figures were released at the same time as a report from researchers at the University of Brighton which claimed that irresponsible lending and intimidating debt collection is driving more people to depression and suicide.

The report said that many people already struggling with wage freezes and benefits cuts during the recession are unable to cope with threatening letters and persistent phone calls.

On the rise: The suicide rate among men is at its highest for a decade according to figures from the Office for National Statistics with the sharpest increase among men aged between 45 and 59

It said: 'Debt clients frequently feel humiliated, disconnected and entrapped, with the process of debt collection having a clear impact on people’s mental health.

'The Government must take urgent action to tackle the problem of irresponsible lending and intimidatory collection tactics which have left thousands of people trapped in a spiral of debt and at risk of depression and even suicide.'

According to the report there were cases of individuals not eating properly and asking their children for money to tide them over.

One individual who owed money described the effect of his wife’s credit card debt and the card issuer chasing her for the money.

The man was quoted in the report as saying: 'I was very close to calling the doctor to her because she is that close to breaking because of these continual phone calls.'

A 48-year-old, who almost attempted suicide before a call to the Samaritans stopped him, has said he is not surprised at the sharp rise in suicides among men of his age.

Mr Shepherd told The Times how during the previous 12 months he lost his job as an online casino's operations manager, witnessed the breakdown of his relationship and had left his Portsmouth home, forcing him to sleep on the sofa in his son's one-bedroom flat in Colchester.

After writing suicide letters he visited a car park with the intention of killing himself, according to the report.

But after looking through the contacts in his phone to see who would miss him, he came across the Samaritans helpline, which he phoned the night before but hung up before speaking.

He said: 'I don't quite know why I did it, but I called the number and the person on the line was really friendly, very understanding when I said where I was.

'They said their office was close to where I was and I could come in for a coffee, and that's what I did.'

Mr Shepherd's life has since improved after re-training as a support worker to help people with learning difficulties.

Meanwhile, Stephen Platt, professor of health policy research at the University of Edinburgh and a trustee for the Samaritans, has warned middle-aged men losing their jobs were being particularly badly affected by the economic downturn.

He said: 'Men judge themselves against a gold standard of masculinity set by society and when they can't meet these expectations they can feel worthless, unvalued, a deep sense of shame and that there is no reason for them to live.'

He has also urged the Government to alter its suicide prevention strategy, which remains focused on young people despite the rise in suicides among middle-aged men.
