A  cupboard has been put on the market for £7,500 as London's housing market reached a new ridiculous peak today.

The estate agent selling the 5ft by 12ft room says it is perfect for someone looking for more storage at a price he believes will save the buyer money.

The walk-in cupboard can only be bought by a resident already living in the Brentford Dock Estate, which sits on the Thames in west London.

All yours for £7,500: This cupboard in Brentford is being put on the market as Londoners scramble for more storage space 

Advert: The particulars on Right Move says: 'This baggage store is perfect for those who are seeking some additional space'

The adverts says the cupboard 'sits idly between' two blocks and is 'just a short walk from the marina and local corner shop'.

It continues: 'This baggage store is perfect for those who are seeking some additional space. 

'The storage cupboard is a good size, perfect for a pushchair or pieces of furniture'.

Much like investors who are selling garages in prime spots for up to £500,000 others are buying up space to cash in on those desperate for storage. 

Sales negotiator Jordan Williams from Quillam Property Services told the Standard: 'People use them as airing cupboards, or to store suitcases or bicycles or memorabilia – things like photographs which they don’t want to throw away but which they don’t have room for at home. 

'If they have a cupboard they know their things are safe and secure and close by. Everybody loves a bit of extra storage.'

The cupboard symbolises the struggle for most Londoners who are unable to afford a property, if at all.

Symbolic: The cupboard is only available to people already living in the estate but represents how people are making money from the lack of space most Londoners have

In London, the average price is now £499,000 – putting it on the brink of a landmark £500,000. Data also shows that first-time buyers must find an average of £204,000 – a 12 per cent rise and the highest annual increase for nearly four years.

Young home-seekers on a typical full-time salary of £21,200 would now need a mortgage of nine times their income with a five per cent deposit.

Even if they do get on the property ladder, storage is likely to be at a minimum in most homes.

But agents maintain that buying a cupboard offers good value because many pay in excess of £100 a month for storage with nothing to show for it.

Mr Williams said: 'If you add up what you could spend on storage compared to buying a cupboard space you might be surprised'.
