Career criminal: Nathaniel Hemy, 15, has been jailed after carrying out a terrifying armed robbery

A career-criminal schoolboy who committed his first offence on the day after his tenth birthday has been jailed today after carrying out an armed robbery at just 15.

Father-to-be Nathaniel Hemy has nine convictions for 22 offences and was sent to a young offenders' institution after he threatened and robbed staff at a corner shop in Southampton.

Hemy burst into the store as part of a hooded gang and threatened an assistant in her sixties with a large knife in the early morning raid, a court heard.

The teenager followed ringleader Sid Pumford, who was brandishing a meat cleaver, and terrorised workers as they opened up for business to get them to open the safe, taking £150.

Judge Peter Henry said Hemy has a 'terrible record' and sentenced him to three-and-a-half 
years in a young offenders' institution.

But his family today defended him and described his 'tough upbringing', where he was in and out of care and didn't even know his father's name.

Jailing him Judge Henry said: 'You were taking an active and physical part in this robbery despite your young age.

'Although you were led, you did take a significant role in what happened. You participated in this robbery in an enthusiastic manner.'

His
crime had had a devastating impact on his victims, who had been 
carrying out their jobs to serve the public, he said.

'The shop assistant has suffered panic attacks, chest pains and one can only imagine the sort of effect what you did had on somebody like her.'

The judge also commended the bravery and courage of Hemy's two victims.

He
said: 'They were both met by the most frightening violence carried out 
by this defendant and others in disguise, armed with potentially lethal 
weapons, a meat cleaver and a knife.

'Having seen the CCTV it is quite clear that both of these members of staff displayed great courage.

'These
two are a shining example of how members of the public stand up to such
thuggish and violent behaviour.'

Frightening: Hemy was part of a gang who raided this store and held staff with knives and meat cleavers - but he was caught after his mobile fell from his pocket

Southampton Crown Court heard he has a 17 year old girlfriend, who is heavily pregnant.

His great-grandmother, Jacqueline
Williams, 71, who helped bring him up, today said: 'He had a tough upbringing. He never knew his father and doesn't even know his name,' she said.

Mitigation: His family today spoke of his tough upbringing, where he grew up without a father and had stints in care

'He went into care at just nine years old and his mother said she wanted him to grow up to be a nice young lad.

'We are so devastated as a family and I know he is gutted he will miss the birth of his first child.

'He has told me he doesn't want his son to end up like him.'

He was sent to a foster home in the New Forest, but constantly ran away.

Mrs Williams added: 'He would come and stay with me or his grandmother.

'We had a great relationship, but he definitely missed having a male role model in his life.

'Having a dad would have been good for him and growing up without one made it harder.'

All of the schools that Hemy went to were for children with behaviour issues.

Mrs Williams added: 'Obviously he made a huge mistake and he had to be punished - he is aware of that.'

His
great-grandmother hopes that when he comes out of Medway Secure 
Training in Rochester, Kent, he will be ready to start a family with his
girlfriend.

Mrs
Williams, who has 18 grandchildren, four great grandchildren and soon 
to be a great great grandmother next week, said they are in 'constant 
contact'.

Threats: Hemy is seen here on the right threatening a member of staff in her sixties as he and a gang robbed the shop in Southampton

She added: 'He is at Medway in Rochester in Kent.

'We speak to him on the phone every night and he's just disappointed that he won't be there for the birth of his son.

'He is such a nice young lad, he has good friends and is always rapping around the house - he even writes his own lyrics.

'I have always got his bedroom made up here and he's always welcome to stay - he's a good lad really.'
