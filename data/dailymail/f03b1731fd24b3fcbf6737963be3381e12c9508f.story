Manchester United will look to arrange a behind-closed-doors friendly for Michael Carrick this week as he steps up his recovery from injury.

The 33-year-old has been out since July with damaged ankle ligaments and has been working with United's physios in the hope of making the squad to face West Bromwich Albion next Monday.

He has been working with the rehabilitation group, which also includes centreback Phil Jones, and has occasionally joined with the first team for some of their weights and exercise training.

Carrick is seen as a key figure by Louis van Gaal and was under serious consideration to become captain prior to his injury.

The 6ft 2in midfielder signed a one year contract last season with the option of another year and is keen to end his playing career at Old Trafford. 

Van Gaal believes his style of play means he can operate as the holding midfielder or at centre half where his passing ability will help United build from the back.

Jones will also step up his recovery from a hamstring injury this week. The 22-year-old defender, who picked up his injury playing for England in Switzerland, hopes to be fit to face Albion although Chris Smalling and Jonny Evans are still considered a few weeks away.
