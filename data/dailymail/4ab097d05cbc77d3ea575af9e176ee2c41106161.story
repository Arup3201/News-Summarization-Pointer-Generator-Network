Forget a draughty horse box or a muddy field. You’re more likely to find this little chap warming his flanks by the fire or nuzzling the crumbs under the kitchen table.

At 22 inches tall, Acer is perfect house pet size, and barely as big as his best friend, his owner’s black labrador, Demon.

As a result he enjoys all the comforts of home. Acer, now aged three, was born with dwarfism, caused by a recessive gene which only affects a foal when it is carried by both of the parents.

Run of the house: The horse's small size means that he makes the perfect house pet for owner Maureen

Best friends: Owner Maureen O'Sullivan with Acer and Demon the labrador - who is inches taller than the horse

Most dwarfism foals are put down because of health problems but his owner, Maureen O’Sullivan, who runs the Miniature Horse Farm in Corringham, Essex, couldn’t bear to part with him.

She said: ‘We imported his dad from America and put him with our American mare and they must both have been carrying the dwarf gene – he was the result.

‘Due to dwarves having various health issues most breeders would have put him down, but little Acer was so full of life and otherwise healthy, it was never an option.

‘One day we were in the living room and he just wandered in, we were really surprised.

‘When he comes in he loves to watch the television, he just stands there staring at it. He likes to walk around and sniff everything so now we let him come and go when he wants.’

Although he is more than welcome to wander around the house, Acer does have his own traditional stable at the farm. But it does cater for his size with the tiniest of stable doors so he can see out onto the yard.

Miss O’Sullivan said: ‘We had the door specially made for him so he can put his head over and see all the other horses.’
