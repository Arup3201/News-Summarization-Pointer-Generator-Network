Stephen King has revealed that the sequel to his 1977 classic horror story The Shining will be published on September 24 next year, 36 years after the original book was published.

The long-awaited sequel, Doctor 
Sleep, follows the story of Danny Torrance, the young boy who survived 
the horrific events in the Overlook Hotel.

The 64 year-old multi-award winning author made the announcement today on his official 
website.

Doctor Sleep: Stephen King has revealed that the sequel to The Shining will be published next September

The new book
will focus on Danny, now in adulthood, who works as a hospice worker and helps his patients die painlessly while also fighting a group of psychic vampires.

One of King's most loved works, The Shining has sold more than a million copies since it was first published in 1977.

Three years later it was adapted into a Hollywood film, which was produced and directed by the late Stanley 
Kubrick and starred Jack Nicholson.

The Shining told the story of the Torrance family, who moved to the 
Overlook Hotel in the Colorado mountains, where father Jack is to act as
caretaker over a long winter.

Jack Torrance, a writer who was played by Nicholson in the film, then 
becomes possessed by the evil spirits in the hotel and attacks his 
family.

But the young Danny, whose psychic abilities strengthened the hotel's 
ghosts, eventually manages to escape with his mother Wendy.

King disclosed the sequel will take up the story when Dan is middle-aged
after 'drifting for decades, desperate to shed his father's legacy of 
despair, alcoholism, and violence'.

The book opens with him settling in a New Hampshire town and taking a 
job at a nursing home where his 'shining' power helps him comfort the 
dying.

Known by the local people as 'Doctor Sleep', Dan comes into contact with
Abra Stone, a 12-year-old who has 'the brightest shining ever seen'.

He also 'runs afoul of a gang of wandering psychic vampires who feed on people's energy'.

No word yet on when Doctor Sleep will be turned into a movie. King famously disliked the big screen version of The Shining, believing too much of the supernatural element was cut from his book.

He said at the time: 'Parts of the film are chilling, charged with a relentlessly claustrophobic terror, but others fall flat. Not that religion has to be involved in horror, but a visceral skeptic such as Kubrick just couldn't grasp the sheer inhuman evil of The Overlook Hotel.

'So he looked, instead, for evil in the characters and made the film into a domestic tragedy with only vaguely supernatural overtones. That was the basic flaw: because he couldn't believe, he couldn't make the film believable to others.

'What's basically wrong with Kubrick's version of The Shining is that it's a film by a man who thinks too much and feels too little; and that's why, for all its virtuoso effects, it never gets you by the throat and hangs on the way real horror should.'
