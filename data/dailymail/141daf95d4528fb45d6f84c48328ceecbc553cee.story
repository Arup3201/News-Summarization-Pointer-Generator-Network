A father killed himself and his seven-year-old daughter in a pre-planned house fire intended to wipe out his entire family, an inquest heard today.

Philip Braithwaite had been suffering from mental health problems and had racked up significant debts when he set the family home on fire last year, Teesside Coroner's Court heard.

The 49-year-old had researched methods on the internet before hand and had left notes suggesting he meant to kill his wife Christine and two daughters in the May day blaze, the inquest was told.

His youngest daughter Jessica, died in hospital the following day while eldest daughter Catriona, now 10, who has cerebral palsy, suffered significant injuries. Mrs Braithwaite managed to escape the 'inferno' and raise the alarm.

Investigations following the fire revealed Mr Braithwaite had disconnected the home’s smoke alarms and brought a petrol can into the family home,  just yards from the sea in Redcar, Teesside.

In a statement read out in court Mrs Braithwaite said her husband began suffering mental health problems about nine months before the fire.

She said: 'Up until July or August 2010 I would describe Philip as being a good husband and a wonderful father. He was a fantastic dad who really adored the children.'

The court heard that Mr Braithwaite had run his own health and safety consultancy firm Cotswold Safety Ltd. But after falling ill in 2010 he had struggled to cope and complained of money problems, including a £17,000 credit card bill.

During his illness he made two suicide attempts, the inquest heard. He had been treated by mental health teams and at one point spent a six-week spell in hospital.

On the night of the fire Mrs Braithwaite was watching television in a downstairs living room. Her husband started the blaze in another livingroom, used as the children’s play room. Catriona and Jessica were upstairs in different bedrooms at the time.

Mrs Braithwaite said she became aware of the fire at about 11.30pm in a hallway. She said: 'As I walked out I was greeted by what I can only describe as an inferno.

'There was a wall of fire that appeared to reach the top of the door whichcompletely filled the doorway with thick, acrid, black smoke gushing out of the room which was choking me.

'I was hysterical, I shouted out "what the hell have you done?" I couldn’tunderstand how a fire could have got so big and intense so quickly. I rantowards the stairs and tried to go upstairs but was immediately choking on the smoke and couldn’t go up.'

The distraught mother then grabbed her mobile phone, rang 999 and ran into the street shouting 'the kids are in there'. Neighbours frantically tried to help but couldn’t get past the flames.

Tragic: Mr Braithwaite had researched methods on the internet before starting the fire at the family home in Redcar, Teesside on May day last year

Redcar MP Ian Swales described it as a 'shocking tragedy' and Councillor Bob Stanway, a neighbour, said it had devastated the whole street.

Both father and daughter died as a result of smoke inhalation, pathologist Dr Nigel Cooper told the hearing. Assistant deputy coroner Clare Bailey recorded the verdicts that Mr Braithwaite killed himself and Jessica was unlawfully killed.

Detective Sergeant Paul Husband, who was part of a four-month investigation into the incident, told the inquest Mr Braithwaite had researched his method online.

He said: 'In order to do this, and building upon his existing professional knowledge, he researched the spread of house fire onthe internet.'

The detective added: 'Notes written by Philip indicate that he intended to kill himself and his family and it seems probable that his actions werepremeditated, although he was suffering from mental illness at the time.'
