It hasn't been the most successful year for Mulberry. The quintessentially British brand, which was once at the height of fashion, suffered four consecutive profit warnings - the last resulted in nearly a fifth of its value being wiped in a day.

At its peak, in May 2012, the share price was nearly 2,500p; last month it was under 700p.

Creative director Emma Hill, who was credited with making the brand what is was, announced her departure back in June 2013, and French CEO, Bruno Guillon, left in March. But Mulberry refuses to admit defeat and the pulling out all the stops to make a comeback.

On the mend? It hasn't been the best year for British brand Mulberry, which is fronted by Cara Delevingne and saw its share price drop to under 700p. But the brand is hoping to make a big comeback with its latest offerings

The brand's first port of call? A tongue-in-cheek Christmas campaign - with gifts starting from a more purse-friendly £80.

There's phone covers at £80, tasselled keyrings at £90, and totes at £495 - a far cry from the eye-watering £2,500 Cara Delevingne bag unveiled earlier this year.

Clearly trying to keep up with younger audiences, Mulberry has unveiled the new Blossom Collection - a range of electric brights totes and rain boots, which they say are perfect for countryside walks and stomping through city puddles.

The Christmas advert, which shows a family trying to outdo each other with presents and the grandmother winning the seal of approval by gifting her granddaughter with a new Mulberry bag, shows the brand's more modern new direction.

The brand is also catering to furry friends this Christmas and has collaborated with luxury dog and cat outfitters Mungo & Maud for a capsule collection of collars (£80) and leads (£110).

Perhaps in an attempt to give Burberry a run for its money, Mulberry has also introduced a complimentary monogramming service over the festive period.

There are monogramming bars in the Mulberry store on New Bond Street and in the brand’s Harrods space. As well as standard letter and number symbols, there's also a set of exclusive Christmas symbols including a Christmas tree, present with bow, holly sprig and snowflake.

So will the brand's efforts pay off? 

Maria Malone, Fashion Business expert at Manchester Metropolitan University, said: 'Mulberry has failed to replicate the stratospheric sales of the Alexa bag with sales peaking in 2011. 

'The recent launch of the Blossom range combines stand out colours and more affordable pieces. Increasing volume sales could be the answer, attracting customers wanting to buy into the brand but who find the more classic handbag price tags prohibitive. 

It's a dog's life: The collars and leads come in bright colours just like the new bags and purses 

'The contemporary designs of the Cara Delevingne range may hit the spot with younger customers new to the brand; but may, in contrast, turn off existing older customers who do not buy into the more obvious celebrity endorsement.'

Founded in 1971 in Somerset by Roger Saul and his mother, Joan, Mulberry started out making belts, leather goods and scotchgrain holdalls,'Clipper bags'. 

Talented Brit Emma Hill took over the design helm in 2007 and was credited with creating the 'Alexa' satchel, inspired by Miss Chung, which still accounts for 27 per cent of sales, and propelled the company into the fastest-growing luxury brand of 2011. 

Bruno Guillon, former managing director of Hermes, was brought in with a remit to raise quality and, more importantly, prices. But it didn't quite go to plan.

After less than three months, Emma Hill announced she was leaving and prices sky-rocketed.

A Bayswater, which in 2009 cost £495, is now £895, while a black ostrich Willow tote costs £5,500.

Tammy Smulders, Managing Partner of SCB Partners & LuxHub at Havas Media, thinks Mulberry may have hit the spot with the new range.

She said: 'As we come out of the recession, luxury brands are starting to pick sides - either increasing their prices aligned with ultra-luxe, or decreasing their prices to become more affordable luxury. It’s becoming increasingly difficult to play the middle ground.

'Mulberry is clearly playing the affordable luxury game, appealing to a wide range of luxury brand aspirants by offering giftable products that appeal and are affordable to a wide range of people. 

'By offering fun coloured products, personalisation, and personal shoppers, they are really pulling out the stops to ensure that their product appeals to a broad range of people. Ultimately this is likely to be a great strategy to drive sales for the holiday season.'
