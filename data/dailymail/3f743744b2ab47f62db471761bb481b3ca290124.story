This is the horrifying moment Greek shipping heiress Athina Onassis suffered a fall in a major showjumping event.

She was halfway through her qualifying competition when she and her white mare came crashing to the ground as they tackled one of the fences.

Miss Onassis, who is 30 next month, escaped unharmed despite landing face down. But her horse, Ad Camille Z-Zang, was so badly injured that it had to be put down.

Just before the fall and devastation afterwards: Athina is the only living descendant of Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis

A crane was used to remove its body from the showring of the 54th CHI International Showjumping Tournament in Geneva as its distraught rider watched.

Miss Onassis is the last living descendant of Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis, who died in 1975 aged 69. 

She is the only child of Christina Onassis, the magnate’s late daughter by his first wife; he subsequently married President John F Kennedy’s widow Jackie.

Upon Aristotle’s death Athina inherited 55 per cent of his fortune, believed to be worth billions.

Heartbreaking: According to French newspaper Le Matin, Anthina appeared to be 'unharmed' but her horse was 'severely injured' and had to be removed from the track using a crane

But she has shrugged off her family’s fame and lives a quiet life in Brazil’s largest city Sao Paulo with her husband, the Brazilian rider Alvaro de Miranda Neto, 41.

She has dedicated herself to carving out an equestrian career. In 2012, she fell from an unnamed horse and sustained a spinal injury which took her out of the sport for more than a year.

Miss Onassis, who competes for Greece, is rarely seen in public but has made an unusually large number of appearances in recent months as her showjumping career hots up.

She last competed with Z-Zang on December 7 at the Gucci Paris Masters in France and before that at an event in Barcelona, coming a disappointing 57th.
