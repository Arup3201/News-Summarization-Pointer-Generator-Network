When I look at Liverpool without Luis Suarez or Daniel Sturridge, they badly lack pace and need Raheem Sterling.

He turned 20 on Monday and it is a lot to ask for a young man to be their talisman, but he has got to live up to that. 

Raheem Sterling will be Liverpool's danger man in their Champions League showdown against Basle

Liverpool want him getting on the ball, dropping deep and dribbling with it, threatening through the centre off the striker. I don’t want to see him out wide that much.

There are not too many Liverpool players who want to go beyond the opposition, but Sterling is their one player who can change the game in a split second. 

He’ll be the man Basle are most afraid of. This game has got that feel about it where they will need a hero — and he has got the ability to be that man.

Stopping Shkelza Gashi  

In Shkelza Gashi the Swiss side have a free-scoring attacking midfield player who will be the main threat to Liverpool’s goal.

He is Basle’s top scorer with 12 goals in all competitions and eight in his past eight games. If Lucas starts in front of the back four he will need to be on top of his game to keep the Albanian quiet. 

It is crucial that Liverpool do not concede early on in this match so they must be wary of Gashi’s danger.

Let Gerrard play 

If Brendan Rodgers plays Lucas in that deeper role it will also give Steven Gerrard licence to play in midfield. 

Not off the front man just behind the striker, but simply in midfield. Due to how well Gerrard played in front of the back four last season, he has been caught between playing there or at the top of a diamond. He needs to shed that. Why can’t Gerrard just be a midfield player?

Look at Yaya Toure for Manchester City, he’s just a midfield player. He is given that freedom. That’s what Liverpool need with Gerrard, let him roam box to box. Big Champions League nights need big players and that’s what he is.

Avoiding the Basle graveyard

It is impossible not to forget the humiliating night in 2011 when Basle beat Manchester United 2-1 to dump them out of the Champions League, when they only needed a draw to go through. 

Liverpool’s record against them is not great, either. They are yet to win and have drawn twice and lost once.

Basle have played English opposition nine times and only lost once.

Having little patience

Liverpool have to score, they must win to go through and the fact a draw is good enough for Basle means the Swiss side could sit back. They are likely to rely on hitting Liverpool on the break.

That could play into Liverpool’s hands. They have the capabilities to open up their opponents, but they might need to take their time and not rush anything in order to win.
