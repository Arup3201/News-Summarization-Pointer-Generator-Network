Apple has reportedly dished out £13million to compensate Swiss national rail operator SBB for using its famous clock without permission.

The company agreed in October to pay a lump sum so it could continue using SBB's Swiss-designed station clock face on its iPads and iPhones.

The size of the settlement was supposed to have been kept confidential, but a Swiss paper leaked details on its website, quoting several unnamed sources.

SBB refused to confirm the report. In 
October, however, it was confirmed that an agreement had been reached 
between the railway operator and the Silicon Valley firm to license the 
design.

It came after Apple introduced the 
clock face design - the same as FBB's, right down to the second-hand 
ending in a circle - on devices using its latest operating system iOS6.

SBB said then: 'For the use of the 
clock face on certain Apple devices such as iPads and iPhones, the 
parties have negotiated an arrangement that enables Apple to use the SBB
 station clock under a license agreement.'

The rail operator added: 'It is a design icon that has obviously lost none of its appeal in the digital age,' the SBB said.

'Even now, it symbolises the 
innovation and reliability that are key qualities attributed to both SBB
 and Switzerland as a whole.'

Up close: Mondaine's designs are known world-wide

The iconic design was created by Hans 
Hilfiker in 1944 and is still used in SBB's stations. Watchmaker 
Mondaine helped spread it across the world after licensing it from the 
train operator.

Hilfiker designed the minimalist clock to help travellers check the time at a distance while hurrying to catch trains.

In 1953, he added a red second hand in
 the shape of a railway guard's signaling disc, which pauses briefly at 
the top of each minute 'to enable trains to depart punctually,' as he 
put it.

The Design Museum in London and the 
Museum of Modern Art in New York both included Hilfiker's clock among 
examples of outstanding 20th-century design.

SBB spokesman Reto Kormann in September confirmed that Apple had not asked for permission before doing using the design.

He said at the time: 'We've approached Apple and told them that the rights for this clock belong to us.'

Although he did add: 'We are proud that this icon of clock design is being used by a globally successful company.'

Technology fans have noted before how many of Apple's iconic designs are remarkably similar to Braun products from the Fifties.

Apple has been embroiled in a string 
of lawsuits with rival technology firms, amid claims and counter-claims 
of copying patents and designs for smartphones and tablet computers.

The company paid SBB 20million Swiss 
francs ($21million, 17million euros) for the right to use the clock face
 design Swiss daily Tages-Anzeiger reported.
