The US Navy today christened the USS Gerald Ford, costliest and most deadly aircraft carrier ever built.

The $13billion warship is the first in the Navy's newest generation of aircraft carriers. It was launched in a grand ceremony Saturday from the Newport News, VA., naval yard.

The Ford is expected to stay commissioned for five decades and will enter the fleet in 2016.

The giant 1,106-foot USS Gerald R. Ford is be able to launch 220 airstrikes per day from its two runways, hold 4,000 sailors 
and marines while appearing virtually invisible to enemy radar.

'She is truly a technological marvel,' Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Jonathan Greenert said at the ceremony 'She will carry unmanned aircraft, joint strike fighters, and she will deploy lasers.'

The staggering number of airstrikes, about one every six minutes, is capable because the ship's deck uses electromagnetic force to propel the jets forward, according to WTKR. Pressurized steam is used in older ships.

Electromagnetic force is used to propel roller coasters, the station noted.

The gear used to snag jets as they land will be software controlled, a significant bump from the systems currently used.

President Ford's daughter Susan Bales Ford spoke shortly before smashing a champagne bottle on the ship's bow.

'Dad, their message fills this shipyard,' she said. 'You kept your promise. You healed the nation. You gave the American people a president that was a shining beacon of integrity at the helm.'

'And as demonstrated by Capt. (John) Meier and by the crew and by this mighty carrier, the American people are forever grateful to you. And Dad, I'll always be proud,' she added.

Other speakers honoring Mr Ford included former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.

The Ford - with a new nuclear power plant, electromagnetic catapults and an enhanced 5-acre flight deck - will leave dry dock and head to a pier at Newport News Shipbuilding next week.

The Navy says construction on the ship is about 70 percent complete and will finish up in 2015. It will then undergo a series of sea trials before it is commissioned and becomes operational.

The Navy also plans to buy another three such carriers, at a cost of $43 billion, to complete its fleet.

But the project to build the most advanced aircraft carrier every made has come at a high price, with costs overrunning to the tune of nearly $3billion and major delays.

Beci
 Brenton, spokesman for Huntington Ingalls Industries, the maker of the 
ship, told FoxNews.com: 'The structure has been rearranged to 
accommodate new technology and meet all of the Navy’s operational 
requirements.

The
 ship’s structure and exterior are now 100 per cent complete, Brenton 
said. But internal connections and features inside the ship are still 
being added.

The ship began construction in Newport News, Virginia, in 2007, but is unlikely to enter sea trials until 2016.

The carrier would be fully capable by February 2019, according to a critical watchdog report.

Delays
 ranging from between two and a half and four and a half years in 
testing three of the ship’s most important new advances: its dual band 
radar, arresting gear and the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System 
that will catapult jets off the carrier have become serious issues.

New generation: The giant 1,106-foot ship is currently under construction at a dry dock in Newport News, Virginia, but will not be commissioned until 2016

And
 the spiralling costs come at a time when the Navy is seaching for ways 
to plug a $14 billion cut in the upcoming fiscal year as a result of the
 automatic federal budget cuts known as sequestration.

The state-of-the-art carrier has provoked strong criticism from some quarters, including the government's own watchdogs.

In

 a report earlier this month the Government Accountability Office wrote:
 'Key ship systems face reliability shortfalls that the Navy does not 
expect to resolve until many years after [Ford] commissioning, which 
will limit the ship’s mission effectiveness during initial deployments 
and likely increase costs to the government.'

It added: 'The Navy faces technical, design, and construction challenges to 
completing Gerald R. Ford that have led to significant cost increases.'

National 
security experts at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, 
the Brookings Institution, have also called into question the value of the aircraft in future conflicts.

'I’m not persuaded they’re worth twice what the old carriers cost,' Michael O’Hanlon, of Brookings, told FoxNews.com.
