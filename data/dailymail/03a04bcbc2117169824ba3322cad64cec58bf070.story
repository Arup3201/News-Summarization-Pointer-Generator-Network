Trouble in paradise? Maygan Sensenberger, left, has been charged with threatening her husband, rod Zimmer, right, and other passengers aboard an Air Canada flight

The 23-year-old wife of a Canadian politician has been charged with causing a disturbance on a plane during an argument with her 69-year-old husband.

Maygan Sensenberger is accused of threatening passengers, using foul language and fighting with her husband, Manitoba Senator Rod Zimmer, aboard Air Canada Flight 8597 from Halifax to Saskatoon on Thursday.

‘It's our understanding that throughout the flight, there was a verbal argument taking place of a domestic nature,’ Alyson Edwards, a spokeswoman with the Saskatoon Police Service, told The Canadian Press.

Witnesses said the 23-year-old blonde beauty was behaving in a rowdy manner throughout the flight, and things only got worse as the plane neared Saskatoon, according to Edwards.

‘The suspect in this case had stated to several people that she believed her husband was in medical distress,’ said Edwards, noting that alcohol may have played a role in the incident.

When the plane landed at the John G. Diefenbaker Airport at 8pm, Sensenberger was met by police. Airport personnel, who are trained in EMS, evaluated Zimmer and determined that he was in good health, Edwards said.

Court records show that police believe the young woman made threats against her husband and threatened to take down the plane.

No one was injured in the incident, according to investigators.

On Friday, Sensenberger appeared in court to be charged with endangering the safety of the aircraft and causing a disturbance.

The 23-year-old woman appeared visibly shaken and was sobbing as she sat in the prisoner’s box.

Following her arraignment, Sensenberger was remanded back to jail until her next court appearance on Monday, which will coincide with her and Zimmer’s first wedding anniversary, according to CBC News.

A Facebook page that was started in 2010 called, Rod Zimmer & Maygan Sensenberger’s Wedding Page, says they tied the knot on August 27, 2011.

Photos apparently taken in the House of Commons show Zimmer and his young fiance gazing lovingly into each other’s eyes and embracing.

Zimmer, who is a Liberal, was appointed to the Canadian upper chamber in 2005 by then-Prime Minister Paul Martin.

Prior to his foray into politics, Zimmer has gained recognition as a philanthropist, serving as president of the Royal Winnipeg Ballet and vice president for the festivals for the Pan American Games Society Inc. 

He also was a member of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers Football Club board of directors and held a position on the board of the Canadian Paralympic Foundation.
