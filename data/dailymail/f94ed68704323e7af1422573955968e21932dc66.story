It is one of the world's fastest supercars, with a 252mph top speed that leaves rivals trailing in its wake.

And now Italian car manufacturer Bugatti has revealed the science behind the Veyron's astonishing top speed by covering the car in the sums used to power it.

Conceptual artist Bernar Venet was asked by Bugatti to create his own design for the £1.5million Grand Sport model.

So the Frenchman, 71, covered the convertible in the complex equations used by engineers in the Veyron’s construction.

The result is a car which brings a new
meaning to the phrase ‘Formula One’ - with the supercar looking more at
home in a science lab or art gallery than on the road.

But
while it looks good sat still, the car’s forte remains its staggering 
performance - accelerating from 0-62mph in just 2.7 seconds.

And Bugatti was clearly pleased with the result, with a spokesman gushing that the car was object that 'integrates the symbol of speed with a fascinating, painterly exterior and an interior that alludes to haute couture'.

The car’s interior also features the mathematical formulae which have been painstakingly stitched in orange onto the inside of the doors.

Artist Bernar Venet said of the car: 'I realised how I could translate my passion for mathematical equations and scientific treatises into three-dimensional form.'

Venet, who is based in New York, said: 'A Bugatti is already a work of art in itself, one that transports both
its beholder and its driver into new dimensions of reality.

'I realised how I could translate my passion for mathematical equations and scientific treatises into three-dimensional form.

'My works are usually self-referential. So I found the idea of translating the equations of the Bugatti engineers onto the bodywork of the car very appealing.'

A standard Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport costs £1.5 million with the firm not releasing a price for its one-off Venet edition, which is currently on display at at the Rubell Family Collection in Miami.
