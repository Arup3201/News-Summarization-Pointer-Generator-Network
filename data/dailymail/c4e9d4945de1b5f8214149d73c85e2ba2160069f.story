These heartbreaking pictures show the scarred faces of the children who have become the innocent victims of war as conflict in the Middle East escalates.

Three-year-old Rahaf and four-year-old Kamar were asleep at home with their family in Homs, Syria, when the government shelled the house.

Rahaf's face and hands were badly burned as the building caught fire, while Kamar's legs and hands and most of her face were similarly injured.

They are now being cared for in Jordan by Medicins Sans Frontieres, where they play quietly with children like 13-year-old Kheta, who has to wear a special mask after most of her face was burnt in a car explosion at Fallujah, Iraq.

Young suffering: Syrian girls Rahaf and Kamar show a picture of themselves before they were injured during the violence in their country, as they attend a psychological therapy session in Amman

The way we were: The girls have had multiple reconstructive surgeries and now attend daily therapy sessions run by Medicins Sans Frontieres alongside dozens of other refugees

Brutal treatment: The two girls play with Khetam from Iraq, who has also fled violence in her country and is being cared for in Amman

Stateless: The school in these youngsters' countries have been bombed or have become temporary shelters for refugees

Their wide, soulful eyes stare out 
from their ravaged faces following the traumatic experience of having 
multiple reconstructive operations on their faces after their escape 
from their homelands.

Like thousands of others, Rahaf and Kamar fled widespread violence in Syria, where many children have been tortured or sexually abused and schools have become battlegrounds or precarious refugee camps.

There are also reports of the opposition
 Free Syrian Army using children in its forces, according to UN 
representative Leila Zerrougui.

Almost 30,000 people have been killed over the past 18 months following the Syrian government's crackdown on pro-democracy activists.

Anti-Assad Syrian groups claim that close to 2,000 children have died in the conflict so far.

In July, a British-based group called War Child said the Syrian conflict is 'disturbingly unique' in the deliberate targeting of children, citing reports of hundreds of children being detained by the regime.

Widespread unrest: The French's charity's project has extended to treat Yemenis, Palestinians, Libyans and now Syrians

Traumatising experience: The aid centre was first set up in 2006 for victims of the war in Iraq, but has now been forced to expand

Shell-shocked: A boy injured by a Syrian Army sniper slumps in a chair at Dar al Shifa hospital in Aleppo, Syria

Painful experience: An injured child cries out as he is treated on a table while adults receive first aid on the floor

Brutality: Doctors administer first aid to two injured men at the hospital as Free Syrian Army fighters and troops loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad clash in the city of Aleppo outside the hospital doors

'Not one of [Syria’s] two million children and young people can now be considered safe,' it said.

An official report in August to the UN Human Rights Council found the Assad government responsible for 49 children killed last May in a massacre in the village of Houla.

This has laid the groundwork for possible prosecution of Syrian leaders in the International Criminal Court.

Ms Zerrougui said the situation for children in Syria was now 'dire', during a Security Council session devoted to naming and shaming governments and armed groups that recruit, attack, or kill children.

The council voted 11 to 0 to cite 52 such governments and groups, including Syria.

The MSF clinic in Jordan's capital, Amman, was set up in 2006 to provide reconstructive surgery to Iraqis - many of them children - injured by bomb blasts and bullets.

Since last year's political convulsions in the Arab world and the continuing unrest across the region, the project has expanded to treat Yemenis, Palestinians, Libyans and now Syrians.

Shocking sight: A wounded father and his son, who has lost part of one leg in a Syrian Army artillery shelling, are carried home in a truck after been treated by doctors in Aleppo

Desperate attempts: A Syrian youth holds a child wounded by Syrian Army shelling near Dar El Shifa hospital in Aleppo, Syria

Under attack: Doctors treat the wounds of a boy hit by artillery shelling as civilians become daily targets for Syrian Army snipers

Appalling: About 90 per cent of the wounded and the dead are civilians

Serious fears: A Syrian boy helps his father sell birds at a street stall in Aleppo, where violent clashes are causing numerous casualties

There are 70 Syrians currently receiving medical care for bullet wounds and torture injuries at the free hospital in Amman, and so many are arriving that a specialised trauma unit reserved for Syrians is about to be opened.

Antoine Foucher, MSF director in Jordan, said: 'The conflict in Syria is intensifying and working inside the country is extremely difficult, which is why MSF is providing treatment to wounded Syrians who have managed to cross the border into Jordan.'

The sharp rise in casualties and refugees indicates the growing intensity of the conflict, which developed from peaceful protests against Assad in March 2011 into a full-scale civil war.

Civilians have become daily targets for Syrian Army snipers and artillery shelling, and most of those fleeing are taking refuge in neighbouring Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey.

In chaos: A Free Syrian Army fighter looks for cover after firing against government forces in Aleppo, Syria, where many civilians are still trapped

Death and fear: A Syrian woman walks past a body in front of Dar El Shifa Hospital, Aleppo, with rebels claiming to have completely cut off the highway link to Damascus to drive out government troops

To close: A wounded Syrian man in Aleppo. Doctors from Jordan are unable to reach people until they are a reasonable distance from the conflict, but many are going at camps en route

Some however, remain trapped in the country, often because their wounds are too severe to move.

Mune, a 55-year-old woman who crossed the river to Hacipasa in Turkey, said: 'The firing started getting intense last night. Some people have been killed, some are lying wounded on the road.

'People want to escape but they can't. Many have settled in a field outside the town and are trying to come,' she said.

Syrian rebels now claim to have completely cut off the highway linking Damascus with Aleppo, preventing government troops to reach the city.

Fleeing their homes: Syrian families, many wounded, travel on foot after crossing to Turkey by boat on the Orontes river of the Turkish-Syrian border

Grave fears: Thousands have fled the Syrian civil war, which now threatens to spread to Turkey

Terrified mothers: An estimated 30,000 people have been killed as main cities such as Aleppo, Homs and the capital Damascus are savagely contested

The U.S. has responded to the escalating 
violence between Syria and Turkey by sending a 150 strong specialist 
task force to its ally Jordan, after concerns that the violence might 
spread across the southern border as well as in the north.

The UNHCR said last month that up to 700,000 refugees may flee the violence in Syria by the end of the year, four times higher than its June prediction.

The number of refugees registered with the United Nations has drastically increased, reaching 335,000. However the real figure could be as high as 500,000, a U.N. refugee agency official said yesterday.

The UN has been working hard over the past decade to protect children in conflict zones. Since 1999, it has passed eight resolutions on the issue, with positive effects in a few countries, such as Nepal and Afghanistan. Former African warlords Thomas Lubanga and Charles Taylor have recently been convicted by the ICC for using child soldiers.
