An aspiring Playboy model and a private pilot were set to make a staggering $2million from drug smuggling when they were arrested at a California airport, it was today claimed.

Krista Boseley, 30, and  Gilles Lapointe, 61, both from Canada, allegedly transported 50,000 Ecstasy pills and around 90lbs of raw MDMA to John Wayne Airport in Orange County on a private jet.  

They were asked to hand over their bags for inspection after officials found out that a plane believed to have previously been involved in drug trafficking had touched down, federal court documents said.

But on doing so, a sniffer dog reportedly discovered the stash of Ecstasy and MDMA hidden in the pair's luggage. MDMA is a powder used in Ecstasy, the club drug known as 'Molly'.

Now, Boseley and Lapointe have been arrested by police and are facing federal drug charges, according to the court documents, filed with the U.S. District Court in Santa Ana. 

Boseley, from Vancouver, British Columbia, is a former real estate agent and aspiring model who had an online modeling profile until this week, when it was taken down, The Vancouver Sun reported.

She has previously been photographed during an open call for Playboy.

During the drugs bust on October 9, Boseley and Lapointe, who had flown to John Wayne Airport from Las Vegas, were seen taking their luggage out of the plane by plain clothes investigators.

They were then spotted going to a rental car desk, where they inquired about hiring a vehicle, before they were searched and apprehended by police.

In addition to the drugs, which were later determined to total an estimated $2million, the pair were found to be in possession of a total of $20,000 in cash, it is alleged.

They reportedly claimed the money was from winnings at the Bellagio Hotel's casino.

Lapointe was spoken to separately by investigators, one of whom wrote in the affidavit that he 'immediately saw a large sum of United States currency' after opening the man's backpack.   

During the investigation, it was revealed that 'Boseley was stopped approximately September 16, 2013, by the Los Angeles Police Department and she was found with over $40,000 in cash.'

According to records, Boseley claimed at the time that the money belonged to someone else. 

Boseley and Lapointe are due in court on October 27. Both of their attorneys declined to comment.
