Architectural genius or barking mad?

Idaho's Dog Bark Park Inn, a bed & breakfast guesthouse inside the World's Biggest Beagle, is the pet project of married chainsaw artists Dennis Sullivan and Frances Conklin.

The pair built 30-foot-high 'Sweet Willy' in 1997, funded through sales of miniature dog carvings.

Needless to say - the Trojan-horse style abode is very dog-friendly.

According to their Facebook page, the B&B proprietorsÂ 'created Dog Bark Park as a venue to make, display and sell their chainsaw sculptures.'

They then decided to build the two big beagles, Sweet Willy and 12-foot-high Toby, 'to add to the dog theme of their work.'

The dog lovers have said they chose the beagle for their architectural feat because it was a safe bet.

'It was the first breed of dog Dennis started carving 28 years ago and it remains a best-seller all this time,' Conklin told BBC.

'Plus, it is a politically correct breed since there are no horror stories about it.'

Sweet Willy sleeps four, with a queen bed in the main section and two twin futons in
the head, all decked out with canine-inspired furnishings.

Guests enter the beagle's
body from a private second story deck, and are treated to dog-shaped biscuits left on their pillows.

Sweet Willy is open from April 1 to October 31 as a guesthouse, but generally open year-round for visitors who just want to check out the Cottonwood park.

The sprawling Dog Bark Park is located in the heart of Idaho's Camas Prairie, 'where wheat, barley, canola, blue grass and hay are the dominant crops'
