To never leave a man behind is a key part of the U.S. armed forces' code of honour, and it now appears the noble gesture is being extended to comrades of the four-legged variety too.

A troop of National Guard soldiers have spoken of their delight at being reunited with the stray dog they adopted on tour in Afghanistan after she, as well as her seven puppies, were air-lifted into New York.

The brave dog, a 65lb mixed breed, became a much loved mascot for the men, who named her Sheba after they discovered her wandering around their base in January.

She displayed her loyalty by joining them out on patrol and chasing away other strays that may have threatened the soldiers.

After
 Sheba gave birth to her pups in March, the soldiers were determined to 
take care of their own -  nursing her back to health with beef jerky and army rations 
before asking relatives to send bags of dog food from home.

'They really became part of the family to us,' 1st Lt Joseph LaPenta of Staten Island said.

Soon, however, the soldiers learned their base would be closed as part of the U.S. draw down in Afghanistan.

'It really broke our hearts that we might have to leave them there' LaPenta said.

That's
 when Staff Sgt Edwin Caba of Long Beach sprang into action and 
contacted an old high school teacher.

She put him in touch with a Long 
Island group called Guardians of Rescue, which has for several years 
collected donations to bring dogs back from combat zones.

They had 
rescued about 20 when the request came in for help getting Sheba and her
 pups.

'We won't turn our 
back on the servicemen and we won't turn our back on the dogs,' said 
Guardians of Rescue president Robert Misseri.

Working with a private 
Kabul-based organization called Nowzad, the groups arranged to have the 
dogs sent to the United States so they could be adopted by the soldiers.

Mr Misseri
 estimates it costs about $4,000 for every dog rescued from a war zone. 
He said an online crowd sourcing fundraiser is still collecting money to
 pay for Sheba and her pups.

The money is needed to pay for 
transportation and other logistics, including health care for the dogs —
 they are quarantined for 30 days and given all their vaccinations 
before being sent.

The 
effort appeared to pay off on Wednesday night when the dogs and the 
soldiers arrived at the Save-a-Pet animal shelter on Long Island to 
celebrate the reunion.

'For 
this to happen now, leashes in their hands, they're kissing their 
faces,' Misseri said with amazement. 'This is what we do.'

New homes: Two of the soldiers are adopting two puppies each, while three soldiers are taking one each. It is hoped the mother dog Sheba can be trained as a service dog to work with veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome

The
 puppies, already six months old and about two feet tall, are named 
Cadence, Rocky, Sarah, Jack, Buckeye, Breezy and Harris. Two soldiers 
are taking two dogs each, and three others are going home with one dog 
apiece. Most will stay in New York; two are headed for the Cincinnati 
area.

Sheba's future is 
still being assessed, said Dori Scofield, vice president of Guardians of
 Rescue, who is caring for the dog at her Port Jefferson Station animal 
shelter.

There is hope Sheba may someday be trained as a service dog to 
work with veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome, 
although Scofield said it is too soon to know if Sheba would qualify for
 such training.

Caba, whose 
home was destroyed in Superstorm Sandy, said the dogs helped divert his 
attention from his troubles at home; he has just completed his third 
tour of duty in Afghanistan.View gallery.'

'It's
 nice to have something to pass the time, get rid of the stress,' he 
said. 'We just a built a bond you can't even describe.'
