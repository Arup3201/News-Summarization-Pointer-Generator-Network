A million chickens infected with bird flu have been killed and disposed of by Mexican authorities.

The virus was found in 18 farms in Guanjuato, a state in the centre of the country, according to the Agriculture Ministry.

Officials say the virus, H7N3, does not pose a threat to humans. A spokesman said: 'This virus is exclusive to birds, so there is no risk for public safety.'

Slaughter: Between a million and two million chicken have been culled in Mexico after contracting bird flu

Nearly two million birds have been vaccinated, with plans for millions more in the coming months.

CNN reported that authorities reported different numbers of how many infected birds had been slaughtered.

Earlier this week Agriculture Minister Enrique Martinez said that more than 2.1million chickens had been killed, including 519,000 egg-producing chickens, 722,265 breeding chickens and 900,000 chickens raised for meat.

Authorities say the strain is not one that affects humans and say the situation is under control

However, Javier Usabiaga Arroyo, a state agriculture official, later said the total number was about 1.2million, according to Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency.

Officials have vaccinated 1.9million birds since the outbreak began earlier this month, and they plan to vaccinate millions more.

The Government also attempted to allay fears about food prices spiking, saying the number is a fraction of the overall chicken population.

'The outbreak of avian influenza is controlled,' Mexico's food safety agency said in a statement.

Other strains of bird flu have spread to humans, sparking mass culls.

In January 1998, authorities in Hong Kong ordered all chickens for sale in markets to be destroyed after the H5N1 strand infected 18 people, killing six.

Later that year a major outbreak of the H5N1 virus in West Bengal, India lead to the culling of 2.6 million birds.

In 2006 there were 65 outbreaks of H5N1 worldwide, killing a total of 115 people - the highest number to die from the disease in a single year.

A new strain of avian flu, H3N8, 
killed 162 harbor seals in New England after jumping from birds to 
humans in July last year. Scientists warn it could be even more 
dangerous if it jumps to humans.
