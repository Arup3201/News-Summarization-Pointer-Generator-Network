Donning designer gowns, elaborate hairstyles and glamorous make-up, this year's Golden Globes attendees were certainly dressed up to the nines.

But during the 72nd annual awards ceremony in Beverly Hilton Hotel on Sunday, a surprising number of celebrities looked a little too bright and shiny.

Hundreds of stars, including Clive Owen and Katherine Heigl, were spotted sporting glistening foreheads and shifting uncomfortably in their seats.

Meanwhile, the original Fargo actress, Frances McDormand, even resorted to using her program book as a makeshift fan to counter the heat. 

This is despite the luxury Beverly Hilton Hotel's  insistence that the air conditioning was working - and presumably, on full blast - during the event.

Feeling the heat: As Clive Owen presented an award, he appeared sweatier than normal - although it likely did not help that he was dressed in a black velvet tuxedo. Oprah Winfrey, meanwhile, was seen wearing smudged eyeliner several hours into the evening

Uncomfortable: Naomi Watts and Lupita Nyong'o (left, on right-hand-side) and Channing Tatum (right) were also pictured looking uncomfortably hot during the 72nd annual awards ceremony at the luxury Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, California, on Sunday

High temperatures: Despite the apparently humid conditions, the hotel has insisted that the air conditioning was working - and presumably, on full blast - during the event. Above, actors John Krasinski and Emily Blunt are pictured looking shiny at the event

When faced with a big black tie event sometimes it's better not to make a statement or to test the boundaries of your fashion credentials, but to stick to something you know will suit you and invariably for most of us that means going classic in black.

Jennifer Aniston is not one to test the waters with a brave new look and for her sophisticated signature style, we salute her. The actress wore Saint Laurent at the Golden Globes last night in Los Angeles and looked sensational in this embellished gown with tuxedo style cumberbund and racy thigh split.

It's a maxi version of a SS15 look by the iconic French label and it suits Jennifer's chic and minimal style. Worn with a pair of simple black high heel sandals and a pared back up do, she's Jennifer through and through.

And replicating the look couldn't be easier. We've found some fabulous maxis complete with thigh high splits, a halter neck cut and even some embellishment. Check them out in our edit below and then get ready to turn heads at your next red carpet worthy event.

Taking action: The original Fargo actress, Frances McDormand, even resorted to using her program book as a makeshift fan (pictured)

Meanwhile, outside the high-profile venue, temperatures in the mid-fifties - teamed with drizzly rain - likely only enhanced the warm, stuffy conditions.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, the atmosphere in the hotel's grand ballroom was so rough that one male attendee 'passed out' at his table. 

On Sunday, Vanity Fair claimed that the air conditioning at the hotel had been entirely shut down, ruining celebrities' expertly made-up faces and hair.

However, the hotel later announced the system had been 'fully operational' and they had not been alerted to 'any issues with the temperature' by guests.

Regardless, the combination of hundreds of people in one room and the array of harsh stage lights apparently led to a steamy atmosphere.

Oprah Winfrey was seen wearing smudged eyeliner several hours into the evening, while a bearded Matthew McConaughey reportedly removed his suit jacket during the star-studded event. At one point, he was even spotted wiping sweat away from the sides of his face, according to Yahoo News.

As Benedict Cumberbatch and Jennifer Anistion took to the stage to present an award, they, too, were seen sporting glistening foreheads.

The same can be said for Kerry Washington, Bryan Cranston, Dakota Johnson, Naomi Watts, Kristin Wigg, Julianna Margulies and Amy Adams.

And as Clive Owen and Channing Tatums presented awards in front of guests and millions of viewers, they both appeared sweatier than normal.

In Owen's case, it likely did not help that he was dressed in a black velvet tuxedo.

Glistening: Another star who looked particularly dewy during the event was actress Katie Holmes (left and right, with Michael Keaton)

Meanwhile, Heigl and David Duchovny glistened with beads of perspiration as they handed the Best Actor in a TV Series - Drama award to Kevin Spacey.

States of Affairs actress Hegil, who was donning a stunning floor-length gown, looked flushed in both the face and chest as she read out Spacey's name.

Other stars to have been snapped looking particularly dewy during the event include actor John Krasinsk and actresses Katie Holmes and Lena Dunham.

In addition to McDormand's makeshift fan, it appears more celebrities may have taken steps to counter the seemingly hot conditions.

At one point during the night, Diane Kruger was spotted drinking directly from her mini funneled bottle of Moet, which she and her boyfriend had brought. 

During the Golden Globes, Julianne Moore, 54, beat off competition from Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, FelicityJones and Rosamund Pike to take home a Golden Globe award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture - Drama.The Still Alice actress was still smiling as she arrived back in New York on Monday. 

Meanwhile, the winners for Best Actor and Actress in a Musical or Comedy were Michael Keaton ('Bird Man') and Amy Adams ('Big Eyes') respectively.
