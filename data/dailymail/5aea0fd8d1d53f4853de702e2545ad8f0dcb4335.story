A mother wept in court today as she described the moment her two-year-old girl fell to her death from the fourth floor walkway of an apartment block through a hole allegedly left by a workman.

As the trial opened of maintenance worker Robert Warner, 45, jurors were told how Ryaheen Banismuslem wandered off from where she had been playing with her five-year-old brother in a communal garden area at the Wicker Riverside apartments in Sheffield city centre.

Her mother, Ola Al Fatle, told the court: 'I didn't let her out of my sight usually.  I followed her and she was not there. It was a very short time.'

She broke down and sobbed in the witness box for about 30 seconds before still shaking she said: 'I was looking for her but I didn't see. I didn't see anything.'

'Then three females said "She was here", and pointed. They were looking down and I saw her down.'

Speaking
 through an interpreter, Mrs Fatle said she had noticed a gap in the 
walkway barrier about two weeks before and and put a bench in front of 
it.

'It was clear to all people and was seen to all,' she said.

The two-and-a-half-year-old girl was rendered unconscious by the fall and died almost immediately, jurors heard.

Mrs
 Fatle, who said she rarely used the garden and would not have gone 
there if she knew the barrier was missing, said she was planning to 
leave the flats because of her safety fears.

Court: Ryaheen's mother Olaz Fatle, left, and father Hikmak Banimuslem, right. Mrs Fatle said she rarely used the garden and would not have gone in there if she knew the barrier was missing

Sheffield Crown Court was told that the workman removed the glass panel to use elsewhere in the building

'It was not comfortable to us as a family,' she said. 'We had nowhere to go, myself and my children.'

Earlier, Bryan Cox QC, prosecuting, said Ryaheen had been playing in an outdoor garden area on the fourth floor of the block with her brother, mother and others when she strayed along a walkway and fell through a gap left by Warner.

The court heard that Warner, who was contracted to carry out maintenance on the apartments, was supposed to replace a panel in the garden area of the flats, which was regularly used by residents for recreational purposes.

But instead of purchasing a new glass panel for the job, prosecutors said he took one from the adjacent walkway, and then invoiced Allsopp Residential Investment Management (ARIM), who oversaw the flat’s maintenance, for the panel he never bought.

Mr Cox told the seven female and five male jurors at Sheffield Crown Court: 'This accident was caused by the defendant's negligent conduct.

'The prosecution say he removed the barrier from the walkway, he failed to replace it and did nothing to prevent access to the walkway and created a very dangerous state of affairs and did nothing to warn of any obvious danger.'

The prosecutor said Warner, who was employed as a caretaker at the block of flats, had had his hours reduced from five days a week to two.

He said a fortnight before the tragedy, Warner had telephoned his manager at ARIM to say two glass panels, one on the ground floor and one on the fourth floor, needed replacing.

The works order was given on 14 June, and he invoiced the company for £176 for two panels.

The prosecution said it was unclear when the walkway panel was removed, but various witnesses had seen panels missing at different times and the garden panel was broken a 'significant' time before 14 June.

Warner told police when interviewed that he had checked the flats two days before the girl fell and there were no broken or missing panels.

But Mr Cox said the panel was deliberately removed from the walkway, and the only person who had a reason to do so was Warner.

He said: 'He did not intend to injure Ryaheen or cause her death, but the negligence was the cause of her death. It was, say the prosecution, grossly negligent.'

The court heard that Warner had more than 20 years' experience working as a builder and maintenance man.

He had undertaken courses in health and safety, and his general tasks included maintaining the flats and grounds of the tower block, as well as menial tasks like clearing up rubbish.

Warner’s company, RS Enterprises, had been operating for two years and made between £35,000 and £45,000 a year, the court heard.

Mr Cox told the jury how Ryaheen was born in Iraq but moved to the UK in 2011 as her father, Hikmat, was studying for a PhD in material physics at Sheffield University.

She died almost instantly from her injuries when she fell 60ft on 27 June 2012, the jury was told.

Warner, of Shiregreen, Sheffield, denies a single charge of manslaughter by gross negligence.

The trial, which is expected to last about three weeks, continues.
