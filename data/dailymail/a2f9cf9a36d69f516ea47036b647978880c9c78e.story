Disgraced NRL player Todd Carney could make his way back into the league after the NRL appeals committee ruled in his favour declaring he was unfairly dismissed from his former team, the Cronulla Sharks.

Tribunal chairman, Ian Callinan QC, ruled that the Sharks board failed to allow the 29-year-old footballer due process before severing his contract. 

This came after a photograph of the player urinating into his own mouth went viral on social media last June.

The committee’s findings state that the former Dally M medallist should have been allowed an opportunity to plead his case in front of the Cronulla board.

Cronulla Sharks chairman Damien Keough said the club will respect the decision made by the appeals committee, adding it is their responsibility to follow correct procedure.

“The big oversight was that someone needed to check that the process being followed was correct,’’ Keogh told The Telegraph. 

Mr Carney's agent claims the photo was a set up and 'an optical illusion'

“What’s important to remember here is that it’s not a question of the facts, it’s a question of the process, but the reality of the situation is, the decision would likely have been the same.

He said he wouldn't completely rule out the possibility of the former Origin player returning to the league but 'there has been a lot of water that has flown under the bridge since last June.'

There's no denying Mr Carney is a talented player, however, his antics off the field have led to the termination of three contracts

The Daily Mail Australia reached out to the Cronulla Sharks however they declined to comment. 

Mr Carney is currently in France nursing broken ribs, sustaining the injury in only his second game for the English Super League Club Catalans.

After what most believed was ultimately the end of the troubled player's career, the five-eighth may surprise us all by staging a return to the league.

As Cronulla is the third team to terminate a contract with the fallen star, the question remains, which team would be game to pick up the controversial player?

Paul Gallen has spoken out on Triple M Radio saying he thinks Mr Carney should allowed to return to the league however he would need a strict contract to curb his bad behaviour.

‘If he wants to come back to the NRL he has to sign a strict contact saying if anything happens to do with alcohol, alcohol related incidents, you are banned for life,’ says Paul Gallen

Rumours are flying on Twitter that the Manly Sea Eagles might be in the market for a five-eighth after the Kieran Foran announced he would be moving to Parramatta in the 2016 season.

Rumours are starting to circulate about the former Cronulla player's options for the 2016 season

Alternately, the ruling now gives Mr Carney the option of perusing legal action against the club by filing an unfair dismissal claim with the Industrial Relations Commission.
