Mark Bright claims many modern footballers have developed a 'soft underbelly' which influences their decisions when the going gets tough.

Bright was writing in the Crystal Palace programme at the end of a week when debate has swirled around Liverpool teenager Raheem Sterling since he told England manager Roy Hodgson he was feeling tired.

'I was no Raheem Sterling, let’s get that clear, but at 19 years of age I was working 40 hours a week in an engineering factory in Stoke-on-Trent. I used to get up a 5am every morning, catch a bus to work and clock on at 6am,' said the former Leicester, Crystal Palace and Sheffield Wednesday striker.

'At 3pm I would clock off, catch another bus to Vale Park where Port Vale’s first-team coach John Rudge would be waiting for me at 3.30pm to take me into the gym to work on my heading, control, fitness and other aspects of my game. Around 5pm I’d shower and walk home to get some dinner then collapse into my bed.

'I did this roughly three times a week along with a Wednesday reserve team game for one season. I was tired and exhausted most of the time, sometimes too tired to go out socially with my friends at weekends, but I did it because I wanted to be a professional footballer.'

Bright, who was at Selhurst Park for the game against Chelsea, added: 'When I turned pro at 20, I can categorically tell you that during my worst moments in football like getting booed and racially abused by my own fans at Leicester City, or going 17 games without a goal at Palace, I never asked to be left out of the team.

Raheem Sterling complained of feeling tired while on international duty with England last week

'On those days, social media wasn't born, no slogans were written on the walls of the training grounds and senior players kept the younger players in check. Someone would utter that old phrase: 'When the going gets tough, the tough get going' and no player wanted to show signs of weakness.

'Things have changed a bit since those days but there is a soft underbelly to a lot of the guys playing the game nowadays.

'Too much reward too soon isn’t something that can be reversed in football nowadays but at times it might be an easy way out when the going gets tough.

'I'm not suggesting that Sterling is doing this but I've heard players spend countless hours playing FIFA 15 on Xbox or PS4, sometimes well into the early hours of the morning. 

'What players must do is make sure they are preparing themselves in the correct manner, in which they can maximise their full potential.'
