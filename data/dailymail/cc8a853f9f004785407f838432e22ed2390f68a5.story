From the iridescence of butterfly wings to the intricacies of plankton, studying nature on a nanoscale could help scientists create machines as small as those inside a living cell.

Now a new book, the 'Nanoscience: Giants of the Infinitesimal', has selected some of the best images from the field to reveal how nature's hidden beauty could be replicated by humans.

The images chart how nanoscience has progressed over the past 50 years showing iconic research such as the smiley faces made from DNA and muscle cells of beef developed from stem cells.

A new book, called the 'Nanoscience: Giants of the Infinitesimal', has selected some of the best images from the field of nanotechnology to reveal how nature's hidden beauty could be replicated by humans. Pictured is a nanoscale image of ice crystals

In 1959, Richard Feynman, a physicist at California Institute of Technology, described how scientists would be able to manipulate individual atoms and molecules to make electronic circuits smaller.

The authors of Nanoscience, science writer Peter Forbes and artist Tom Grimsey, suggest that copying nanoscale processes in nature could have more significant consequences.

From clean harvesting solar energy and finding cost-effective methods to desalinate sea water, nanotechnology, they claim, can revolutionise human processes.

For a sense of scale, sheet of paper is about 100,000 nanometers thick while a human hair is about 80,000 to 100,000 nanometers wide.

Pictured here are nanoflowers created using carbon. They were created by a Harvard University team who realised the ancient dream of creating complex 3D structures simply by mixing chemicals. These flowers were creating by passing carbon dioxide through barium carbonate and silica microstructures to produce stems, vases, corals and other structures. False colour has been added to the image

In 1959, Richard Feynman, a physicist at California Institute of Technology, described how scientists would be able to manipulate individual atoms and molecules to make electronic circuits smaller. Shown here is a nanoscale view of plankton. These specimens were living between crystals of annual sea ice in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica

The ideas and concepts behind nanoscience started with a talk entitled 'There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom' by physicist Richard Feynman in 1959.

He described how scientists would be able to manipulate individual atoms and molecules to make electronic circuits smaller.

He also suggested that it should be possible, in principle, to make nanoscale machines that 'arrange the atoms the way we want', and do chemical synthesis by mechanical manipulation. 

One of the images highlighted in the book are the muscle cells of beef developing from stem cells.

Last year, cells such as these were used to create the world's first stem cell burger. It was made of 20,000 small strands of meat grown from a cow's muscle cells and took three months to create.

Such natural nanostructures have been used to template material such as titanium dioxide that is used in sun cream and food colourings.

Chloroplasts inside plant cells are also revealed. These are the photosynthetic factories of plant cells, where the energy of sunlight is converted into energy-rich biomass - a process scientists are emulating to create 'green' energy.

The writers claim that nanoscience is about 'bringing us to the point where life starts: the point where precisely nanostructured chemicals take on the properties of life'.

By peering into the tiny structures that make up the world around us, the authors believe we could be on the way to establishing a 'nanotechnology revolution.'

Paul Rothemund's famous DNA smileys that adorned the cover of Nature magazine in 2006. Rothemund's work led to a boom in DNA nanotechnology. Dr Rothemund  used these smileys to show a simpler way to rearrange DNA. He showed that  long, single strands of DNA can be folded back and forth to form a basic scaffold. The basic structure is then supplemented by around 200 shorter strands, providing a shape that can bear a complex pattern, such as this smiley face

The individual scales of a butterfly's wing can be seen here. Butterfly wings don't possess pigmented colour. Instead they create their brilliant displays using a trick of the light. Something known as 'photonic crystals' create geometric patterns at microscopic scales. The paterens are spaced very close to the wavelengths of light in ways that intensify the reflected light of certain colors and absorb others

Shown here are chloroplasts inside plant cells. These are the factories of plant cells, where the energy of sunlight is converted into energy-rich biomass, a process scientists hope to emulate to create 'green' energy
