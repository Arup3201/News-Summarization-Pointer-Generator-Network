Prime Minister Tony Abbott has called on moderate Muslims to stand up to local extremists, warning the community shouldn't be complacent against a possible 'mass casualty event'.

Mr Abbott is meeting community leaders in Sydney on Monday and in Melbourne later in the week, to try to sell sweeping new anti-terror powers aimed at stopping Australian militants fighting overseas.

The government is facing a backlash from Islamic groups, who fear they will be unfairly targeted by the new laws.

Mr Abbott says Australia faces a serious threat from radicals who travel overseas to fight with terror groups in Syria and Iraq and then become 'militarised and brutalised' by the experience.

Mr Abbott says everyone should put the people and the values of Australia first

Addressing a 'multicultural media conference' in Sydney's inner-west, Mr Abbott said the laws were not about protecting 'one group of Australians from another group of Australians', in an apparent reference to concerns from the Muslim community.

He said it was in the 'absolute interests' of every community to 'expose and to counter any potential for home-grown terrorism'.

'Because if there is one thing that could damage the rich and strong social fabric of our country, it would be a mass casualty event,' he told the forum.

Mr Abbott is concerned that the 150 Australians involved in conflicts in Syria and Iraq may bring their radicalised view of Islam back to Australia.

'The last thing we should be is complacent about this,' Mr Abbott said.

'We've been successful up until now in identifying and preventing potential terrorism.

'I pray to God that we continue to be successful in this very important (area).'

On the threat of terrorism: 'We do have to be vigilant against it - and my position is that everyone has got to be on Team Australia.'

Reporters from AAP, Fairfax Media and the ABC were prevented from attending the event and were told that it was intended for 'multicultural media'.

Mr Abbott earlier urged moderate Muslims to join the 'Team Australia' fight against locally-bred extremists.

'What we need to do is to encourage the moderate mainstream to speak out,' he told Macquarie Radio.

'We do have to be vigilant against it - and my position is that everyone has got to be on Team Australia.

'Everyone has got to put this country, its interest and its values and its people first.'

He was also asked about reports that shops in Sydney's southwest were flying Islamic State flags despite the group being listed as a terrorist organisation.

'I don't know what the legal position is, but frankly, the only flag that should be flying is the Australian national flag,' he said.

'If people want to fly other flags - a corporate flag for instance - fine, but the Australian national flag should always be part of it.'
