Tony Blair planned to invade Zimbabwe with South African support and oust Robert Mugabe after the country descended into chaos, it was claimed yesterday.

Former South African president Thabo Mbeki said Mr Blair asked for his help in 2000.

But Mr Mbeki favoured a negotiated settlement and, despite pressure from Britain to join military action to depose Mr Mugabe and his Zanu-PF party, he refused.

Pressure: Tony Blair and Thabo Mbeki in 2006. Mr Mbeki has attacked Mr Blair's interventionist foreign policy

Allegation: Mr Mbeki has claimed that 13 years ago Tony Blair asked him for help in 'invading' Zimbabwe

During his presidency from 1999 until 
2008 he said South Africa and Britain were in stark disagreement over 
how to handle Mugabe. He added: ‘The problem was, we were speaking from 
different positions.

‘There
 were other people saying, “There are political problems, economic 
problems – the best way to solve them is regime change. Mugabe must go”.
 This was the difference.

‘But we said, “Mugabe is part of the solution to this problem”.’

The
 South African government helped to broker a power-sharing agreement 
between Zanu-PF and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) 
in 2008. It later collapsed.

Lord
 Guthrie, who was Chief of the Defence Staff during Mr Blair’s first 
term, disclosed in 2007 that ‘people were always trying to get me to 
look at’ toppling Mr Mugabe by force.

However
 he did not say these requests had come from the Prime Minister himself,
 and suggested he did not consider it a serious proposition.

But
 Mr Mbeki cited Lord Guthrie’s comments to the Al Jazeera TV channel 
yesterday to corroborate his claim against Mr Blair. He added: ‘A 
retired chief of the British armed forces said he had to withstand 
pressure from Tony Blair, who was saying, “You must work out a military 
plan so we can physically remove Robert Mugabe”.

Talks: Tony Blair, pictured left with former South African president Thabo Mbeki, has strongly denied plotting military action against Robert Mugabe, right. Mr Mugabe's 33-year rule has included a crackdown on opponents

‘We
 knew that, because we had come under the same pressure, and that we 
need to cooperate in some scheme – it was a regime change scheme – even 
to the point of using military force, and we said “No”.’

He
 claimed the idea was rejected because Britain had no right to decide 
who leads African countries, adding: ‘You are coming from London, you 
don’t like Robert Mugabe for whatever reason and we are going to remove 
him and we are going to put someone else in his place?

‘Why
 does it become British responsibility to decide who leads the people of
 Zimbabwe? So we said, “No, let Zimbabweans sit down, let them talk”.’

Violent
 land reforms in 2000 and 2001 saw some 4,000 white Zimbabweans forced 
from their farms, while hyperinflation took the economy to the brink of 
collapse.

While Mr Blair 
condemned the regime and backed tougher sanctions, Mr Mugabe accused 
Britain of plotting to overthrow him and ‘recolonise’ Zimbabwe.

A
 spokesman for Mr Blair said: ‘Tony Blair has long believed Zimbabwe 
would be much better off without Robert Mugabe and always argued for a 
tougher stance against him, but he never asked anyone to plan or take 
part in any military intervention.’
