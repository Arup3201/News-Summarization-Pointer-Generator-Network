One of the members of the Waco cult has claimed that the group was not ‘brainwashed’ even though its leader took 19 wives and slept with girls as young as 12.

Clive Doyle said that he did not want people to think that anyone had been ‘deceived’ or was being held against their will at the camp.

He wanted people to ‘open their eyes’ and called for a ‘different perspective’ on the group’s leader David Koresh.

Doyle’s claims are an attempt to rewrite the history of the 51-day siege in 1993 which ended when an army of government agents stormed the headquarters of the Branch Davidians in Waco, Texas.

In the ensuing shootout and fire, 76 people including 23 children were killed as the world’s media looked on in horror.

Details about the bizarre activities at the Branch Davidian camp have since emerged in memoirs and accounts from former cult members who have described it shocking detail, The New Yorker reported.

Koresh literally saw himself as the son of God and lured in disaffected Seventh-Day Adventists to his bizarre regime in which he preached for 15 hours a day and forced them to get up at 5.30am for boot camp like drills with no water.

The most sinister part was the alleged abuse of underage girls, including his niece, and how he used to beat up babies until they were bloody.

Girls and boys were also beaten for minor offenses like spilling milk and were told to refer to their parents as ‘dogs’.

Koresh believed that he had total control over all women on Earth and took 19 wives, fathering at least 13 children with them.

According to Australian-born Doyle, however, the inner workings of the cult were deeply misunderstood.

In
 his memoir: ‘A Journey to Waco: Autobiography of a Branch Davidian’, 
Doyle writes that now is the time to look again at a group which was 
just very different from the rest of the world.

He
 writes: ‘If people read this account, they will at least gain a 
different perspective on who David Koresh was, where he was coming from,
 who we were, and why we believe the way we do.

‘Most people think ‘cult’ about us and think we are people who were brainwashed and deceived.

‘They think our church members don’t know what they’re doing or where they’re going. Hopefully, my story can open their eyes.’

Koresh
 had taken over the leadership of the Mount Carmel Center in the late 
1980s but it was not until 1993 that things came apart.

Burned-out: The Branch Davidian compound was destroyed during an FBI assault to end the 51-day standoff with cult leader David Koresh and his followers in 1993

Full-frontal attack: The FBI stormed the compound with 12 tanks, four combat vehicles and 1,890 people in a show of force to persuade Koresh to surrender

The end came when 80 armed agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms raided the Mount Carmel community to try and arrest him for supposedly violating federal firearms laws.

It was a disaster from the start as the cult had been tipped off and were heavily armed. A shootout began which forced the ATF to retreat and start the siege.

Meanwhile the FBI brought together what is thought to have been the largest military force ever assembled to deal with a civilian target, including 12 tanks, four combat vehicles and a total of 1,890 people in a show of force to persuade Koresh to surrender.

He refused and the negotiations went on for weeks with the property surrounded until the FBI decided it had waited long enough and went in.

As the bullets rained down Koresh is supposed to have told his followers: ‘Martyr yourselves. Go out, freak out, shoot...openly fire and get shot, but kill many before you die.'

Doyle writes that during the chaos he heard Koresh say: ‘I want you all to go back to your rooms and stay calm.

‘I could hear David’s steps going down the hall toward the front door...Then all of a sudden I heard David say: ‘Hey, wait a minute! There are women and children in here!’

‘Then all hell broke loose - just a barrage of shots from outside coming in. It sounded like a bloodbath.’

During the siege Koresh also made a chilling video message in which he vowed to come out fighting if the FBI came near him.

He told the camera: ‘You come pointing guns in the direction of my wives and my kids, damn it. I’m going to meet you at the door every time.’

Wearing a pair of aviator sunglasses and surrounded by dozens of toddlers and babies he also said ‘no-one is going to start...pushing my family around’.

After the massacre, in which Koresh was among the victims, President Clinton commissioned a report by the Treasury, which oversees the ATF.

It found that the agency had made grave errors in the planning and execution of the raid.

Stephen Higgins, the director of the ATF, was fired and five other officials were suspended.
