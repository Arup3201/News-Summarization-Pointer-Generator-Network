Incredible: Iria Wolnick (pictured) helped deliver the baby of Niser Saldana-Quilantan, 19, after the teenager was mortally wounded after a car crash in July last year

Around midnight on a hot summers night last year, Iria Wolnick was driving along the desolate US Highway 77 south of Corpus Christi, Texas, when she saw the burning wreck of an upturned SUV, which had catastrophically come off the road.

The 36-year-old San Jose massage therapist pulled over and rushed to the wreck to find a young family of three had been been thrown from car as it flipped - a two year-year-old, his father and his mother, who was pregnant.

The mother, 19-year-old Niser Saldana-Quilantan, asked if her unborn child was OK and it was then that an astonished Wolnick saw a huge cut on the woman's stomach, heard a baby crying and saw a head and tiny hand emerging from the wound.

'She kept saying, 'How's my baby? How's my baby?' said Wolnick according to Mercury News about the night of July 5.

'My reaction was to spring into action and do what I could.'

Using
 only her own instincts and what little first-aid training she knew, 
Wolnick delivered the six-pound, 11-ounce baby, named Emma Lyn Anahi 
Ortega through the wound in her mother's abdomen.

'The
 babyâ€™s head and one of her hands was protruded out of the laceration 
that she had to her abdomen, and the baby was crying which is 
unbelievable and wonderful,' said Wolnick to Valley Central.

Born: Baby Emma Lyn Anahi Ortega was delivered by Wolnick on the side of the road after the child's mother suffered fatal wounds

Survivor: Baby Emma lost her mother, but her father and brother made it through the accident

According to Mercury News a passing truck driver used his own shoelace to tie off the umbilical cord.

The little girl's mother, who was eight months pregnant saw her baby girl born before she lost consciousness, but sadly died later on that evening in hospital.

The two-year-old, Adrallis Ortega and his father, Edward Ortega were injured, but recovered.

Wolnick was honored in San Jose on Wednesday morning by the CHP and the Texas Highway Patrol division, who presented her with a plaque.

'These days, a lot of people would drive right by, thinking it's someone else's responsibility,' said Lt. Jeremy Rowland of the Texas agency according to the San Francisco Chronicle.

'Her actions were truly rare and heroic. If it hadn't been for her, two people would have died that night.'

Captain Les Bishop of the CHP said he had never heard a highway rescue story quite like this one.

'For someone with limited training, to be acting only on instinct, to do something like this, well, she deserves this and a lot more,' he said.

'It's something you would expect from law enforcement or a paramedic, but from a citizen. It's truly extraordinary.'

Wolnick was already traveling with a load on her heart that evening because she was driving to her mother's funeral.

'I was given the opportunity to bring life into the world in those conditions,' she said.

'It's not something that happens every day.'
