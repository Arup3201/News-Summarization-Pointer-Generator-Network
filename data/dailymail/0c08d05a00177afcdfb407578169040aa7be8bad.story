‘On the 22 October of last year the defendant has entered the Palace of Westminster and sat down in the public gallery in order to observe Prime Minister’s Questions,’ said Darren Watts, prosecuting.

‘Without warning the defendant has then stood up and said: ‘I’m sorry about this, ladies and gentleman, but you [addressing the MPs] are all just w***kers, you are all liars.

‘He then threw a bag of marbles at the glass screen protective screen, causing them to scatter and causing alarm and distress to those watching.

‘He was arrested and admitted causing criminal damage in the form of graffiti.

‘He had written ‘the enemy within’ using red paint on the wall of the Palace of Westminster... another incident captured on CCTV.’

MPs heard a loud bang and shouting but did not halt the proceedings.

Shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry had tweeted: ‘There’s a fracas in public gallery £pmqs. Tried to lip read man as he’s dragged out. Believe he’s shouting ‘Answer the b***** questions’.
