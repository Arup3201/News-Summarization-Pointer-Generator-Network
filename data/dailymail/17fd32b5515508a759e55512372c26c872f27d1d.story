Anger: Stormont Justice Minister David Ford said today the attempted murder of a police officer in Belfast was an attack on all of Northern Ireland

A second viable pipe bomb-type device has been discovered near a police station in Northern Ireland.

Elderly residents were evacuated from their homes in Tandragee, Co Armagh, but have been allowed to return as the security alert has ended.

Army technical officers examined the object close to the gates of the town's Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) station, a short distance south of Portadown.

Newry and Armagh DUP Stormont assembly member William Irwin condemned those responsible.

'This is a very concerning incident especially in a rural town like Tandragee and it is especially concerning when so many residents, many of whom are elderly, have had to leave their homes whilst this suspect device is dealt with,' he said.

'No one in Tandragee wants this type of disruption and indeed considering the threat to our police officers remains so high at the moment, having devices left at police stations is extremely reckless and totally abhorrent.

'Young families also go for walks out the Armagh road and pass the station gates, which only adds to the risk this suspect device could have posed.'

It comes after a booby trap device was discovered under an officer’s car in east Belfast.

Police have said the unexploded but viable bomb, which was discovered by the off duty policeman on Sunday afternoon, was clearly intended to kill him.

The constable was about to take his wife and two young children out for Sunday lunch yesterday when he checked under his car outside his house in the city and discovered a viable device.

Assistant Chief Constable George Hamilton said: 'If that officer had not checked under his car we would have been looking at a murder or multiple murders.'

Stormont’s Justice Minister David Ford, who condemned those responsible, said: 'Fortunately, due to the officer’s commendable vigilance, the attempt on his life was not successful.

'Let us be clear. This was an attack not only on a police officer and his family but on our whole community. The officer was serving the community; he was working for all of us.

'The people responsible for this and other recent attacks have no mandate and speak for no-one. They need to recognise the futility of their campaign and respect the wishes of the vast majority of our community who want an end to all violent acts.'

The car was parked off Newtownards Road is one of the busiest 
arterial routes into Belfast.

The officer's home is close to Police Service of Northern Ireland headquarters at Knock and the Northern Ireland Assembly at Stormont.

Residents of nearby homes were evacuated to a local church while army technical officers worked to make the scene safe.

Assassination attempt: Police evacuated residents and closed Upper Newtownards Road whilst army technical experts dealt with a 'viable bomb' found under the police officer's car outside his home

Police believe the murder attempt is the work of rebel republicans who 'don't care who they attack and don't care who they kill,' Hamilton said.

'They are simply anti-peace and determined
to carry on bringing pain and devastation to families and communities 
by maiming and killing.'

He said it was very fortunate that the device was detected in time so that no-one was killed or seriously injured.

Dismantling: It is believe the policeman discovered the viable bomb himself around 2pm yesterday afternoon after which security forces were called

'Initial investigations would 
indicate that this was a viable device placed below an officer's car 
sometime in the last 48 hours.

'It was clearly intended to kill the 
police officer. His family and neighbours in the vicinity were also put 
at risk of serious harm.

'Obviously there are people out there who are still intent on causing murder and mayhem.'

Terry Spence, chairman of officers' representative body the Police Federation, said the device was planted by 'cowardly thugs'.

‘This was an attempt to murder an off-duty police officer,’ he said.

‘But this attack is no great 
surprise. Scores of police officers have been forced from their homes in
the last 12 months because of terrorist incidents. This is just the 
latest of many.

‘It reinforces the need for officers to be extra vigilant.’

Democratic Unionist Assembly member for East Belfast Robin Newton condemned those responsible.

‘Those who placed this potential bomb have nothing to offer the community except heartache and sorrow,’ he said.

‘The thugs who carry out this type of
an action are rejected by the vast majority of the community as being 
wicked and evil ... who care nothing for innocent life.

‘I pay tribute to the PSNI officers 
and the bomb squad officers who risked their lives to make the area safe
not only for the intended victim but all who live in close proximity.’

East Belfast Alliance MLA Chris 
Lyttle said: ’My immediate thoughts and prayers are with the officer and
family directly affected by this cowardly and futile act and the people
working to restore safety to all residents in the area.

Northern
Irish dissidents have repeatedly targeted security force members in 
recent years in a bid to destabilise the peace process.

In November long-serving prison officer David Black, 52, was shot dead in a motorway ambush in Co Armagh as he drove to work.

The attack was claimed by a group styling itself the 'new IRA' 
which was formed in the summer when a number 
of splinter groups joined forces.

In April 2011 newly qualified police 
officer Ronan Kerr (top right), 25, died when a booby trap car bomb 
exploded under his vehicle at his home in Omagh.

‘Those behind this incident have 
absolutely nothing to offer the local community and are only intent on 
taking Northern Ireland back to a time of deep division through violent 
attacks.

‘Anyone, from whatever background, 
considering an attack on the PSNI should remember that officers have the
full support of the vast majority of people across Northern Ireland.

'Any attack will only serve to risk misery to families and resolve the 
will of this community to reject violence in favour of peace.’

SDLP Policing Board member Conall McDevitt said the murder bid was a 'cynical and deplorable act'.

‘Those seeking to target police 
officers are undermining not only the stated will of the people of 
Ireland who have long since rejected violence, but also the desire for a
new beginning for policing in the North, which is shared by the 
majority of citizens,’ he said.

Chief Constable Hamilton appealed for anyone with information on the latest murder bid to come forward.

'Attacks on police officers are attacks on the entire community and cannot be allowed to continue,' he said.

'We know there are people within our communities who know who did this, we know there are people out there who know exactly what is being planned.

Double threat: The bomb was discovered yesterday afternoon close to the policeman's home which is located near the Police Service of Northern Ireland Headquarters

'The community can be assured that the Police Service of Northern Ireland will do everything possible within the law to bring those responsible to justice.

'However it is very important that we get information about this incident quickly. We need support from members of the public in bringing those responsible to justice.'

Police want to hear from anyone who witnessed any suspicious activity on the Upper Newtownards Road between the junction of Cabinhill Park and Knock Road between Friday afternoon and lunchtime today

Detectives can be contacted on 0845 600 8000 or information can be passed anonymously to the Crimestoppers charity on 0800 555111.
