Labour leader Ed Miliband faced embarrassment yesterday after he bungled the task of sending a tweet to mark the death of Bob Holness.

A tribute to the Blockbusters host on his Twitter account read: ‘Sad to hear that Bob Holness has died. A generation will remember him fondly from Blackbusters.’

Within minutes, the message was removed and replaced with the correct spelling of the game show. 

The mistake suggests the Labour leadership might still have Thursday’s race row on its mind, when shadow minister Diane Abbott apologised for tweeting that ‘white people love playing divide and rule’.

Just minutes ago the Labour Party leader took to Twitter to pay tribute to Blockbuster host Bob Holness, typing 'Sad to hear that Bob Holness has died. A generation will remember him fondly from Blackbusters'

Correction: Ed Miliband hastily corrected his gaffe with the right spelling of Blockbusters

Mr Miliband’s gaffe has sparked a 
Twitter storm, with a competition establishing itself on the internet to
come up with other fitting mistakes based on game show titles.

Examples included ‘Ready Steady 
Cock-up’, ‘Come Diane With Me’, ‘Mock the Weak’, ‘Bland Gate’ and ‘Eight
out of Ten Cuts’. Some concentrated on his thorny relationship with 
leadership rival and brother David Miliband, such as ‘Family 
Misfortunes’ and simply ‘Big Brother’.

Other genuine titles that tweeters 
suggested might be appropriate for Mr Miliband included ‘I’m Sorry I 
Haven’t A Clue’, ‘Are You Smarter Than A Ten Year Old?’ and ‘The Weakest
Link’.

Then there were more suggested spoofs,
including ‘Dancing on Thin Ice’, ‘Mastermindless’, ‘Blackety Black’, 
‘Universally Challenged’, ‘Dole or No Dole’, ‘Wheel of Misfortune’ and 
‘Balls Eye’. At one point yesterday, the competition was the most 
popular subject on Twitter.

Meanwhile, Miss Abbott became 
embroiled in yet another race row yesterday after it emerged she had 
accused taxi drivers of racism in another tweet earlier in the week.

Ed Miliband quickly deleted his mis-spelled tribute to Bob Holness, who died today at the age of 83

Whoops! Ed Miliband's tweet has been trending on Twitter this afternoon

London cabbies attacked her suggestion
that they do not pick up black passengers. She had tweeted: ‘Dubious of
black people claiming they’ve never experienced racism. Ever tried 
hailing a taxi I wonder?’ 

Steve McNamara, a spokesman for the 
Licensed Taxi Drivers Association said Miss Abbott was indulging in the 
‘stereotypes of the 1960s’, and that many drivers now were black and 
Asian.

‘At worst she is racist and at best she is stupid in making comments like that,’ he said. ‘Either way, she should go.’  

Mr Miliband has endured one of his 
most difficult weeks as Labour leader – being attacked in print by his 
guru and criticised by one of his frontbenchers.

On Tuesday, academic Lord Glasman, who
received a peerage on Mr Miliband’s recommendation last year, wrote 
that the leader had ‘no strategy, no narrative and little energy’.

A day later, a memo written by Labour 
spin doctor Tom Baldwin was reduced to claiming that Mr Miliband was not
as bad an Opposition leader as Iain Duncan Smith.

And on Thursday, it emerged that the 
party’s defence spokesman, Jim Murphy, was distancing himself from 
Labour’s attacks on Government spending cuts.

He told The Guardian that 
Labour’s credibility depended on rejecting ‘shallow and temporary’ 
populism.

Abbott's comment about 'divide and rule' caused a Twitter storm and led to calls for her resignation
