A top of the line, fully loaded iPad mini could set gadget fans back as much as £520, if leaked reports are to be believed.

A price list pictured by the site Mobile Geeks appears to give the cost and details of eight different iPad mini models.

The shot is purportedly an image of an inventory system used by Media Market / Saturn, which is a retail group with employees in Europe and Asia. 

Another leak? This image published on German site Mobile Geeks purports to show a price list for eight different models of iPad Mini

The inventory list notes prices for 8,
16, 32, and 64 GB models with Wi-Fi, then a separate version of each 
model with integrated cellular radios for connection to mobile networks,
making for a total of eight models.

If the information is correct, the 
base model is €249 (£200), with a cost increase of €100 (£80) to double 
the storage and an additional €100 on top of that to add cellular.

The most impressive model, the 64 GB with cellular, would be €649 (about £520).

Apple's new iPad mini is rumoured to 
be less that two weeks away. The company will unveil the gadget on 
October 23, the AllThingsD website has suggested.

An apparent silence from Apple had left many wondering if the company still planned to début a smaller iPad

Others had speculated that production delays may have forced it to postpone the device’s unveiling until later in the year.

But it appears that neither is the case.

The new iPad 'mini' as it might look next to the new iPhone 5 and the current iPad 2

As AllThingsD reported in August, 
Apple will hold a special event this month, at which it is expected to 
showcase the new, smaller iPad.

People familiar with Apple’s plans 
told the website that the company will unveil the so-called 'iPad mini' 
on October 23 at an invitation-only event.

The date happens to be just three days before Microsoft’s new Surface tablet is due to hit the shops.

It has been suggested the launch event
will take place at Apple’s Town Hall Auditorium, where it has débuted a
number of products there in the past - OS X Lion, a next-generation 
MacBook Air and the iPhone 4S.

The unveiling of the iPhone 5 and the 
2012 iPod line was held at San Francisco’s Yerba Buena Centre for the 
Arts, leaving people to believe that this launch will be a smaller 
affair.

Sources say the iPad’s smaller sibling
will feature a 7.85in liquid-crystal display and a Lightning connector,
according to AllThingsD.

A leaked picture purported to show the iPad Mini implies there is no rear camera on the portable device

Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was 
apparently set against a smaller iPad, but relented in the 
months before his death last year, according to emails discussed in the 
Apple vs Samsung patent dispute.

During testimony during the ongoing 
trial, submitted court documents suggest Steve Jobs was tempted to enter
the seven-inch market.

He presented an email from Apple vice 
president Eddy Cue, who said: 'Having used a Samsung Galaxy Tab [a 
seven-inch Android tablet], I tend to agree with many of the comments 
below…

'I believe there will be a seven-inch market and we should do one.

'I expressed this to Steve several times since Thanksgiving and he seemed very receptive the last time.'
