Smiling contentedly and holding the hand of his great-grandson, this is the last known portrait of Nelson Mandela. It was taken in May as he rested at home in Johannesburg in his favourite armchair – just a month before he was hospitalised.

For Mr Mandela’s family, the  picture stands as a charming souvenir of happier times. And for three-year-old Lewanika it will, says his father, become ‘something he will treasure when he is old enough  to understand’.

It is a fitting final image of a  historic figure whom all of South Africa is mourning – yet also celebrating for his legacy of peace, a statesman whose influence will be deeply felt all around the globe long into the future.

Final portrait: The last known photo of Nelson Mandela, taken in May, sees him with his great-grandson, three-year-old Lewanika, holding his hand and smiling

Balancing on the edge of the chair, Lewanika gazes intently at South Africa’s founding father, the man who became a symbol of his country’s struggle against injustice, but who the little boy knew simply as ‘Baba’.

In an exclusive interview with  The Mail on Sunday yesterday Lewanika’s father Ndaba Mandela – Mr Mandela’s grandson – said he took the picture as he sensed it might be the last opportunity to  capture them together.

‘It was around May, one Saturday afternoon. We were literally just coming to say hello to the old man and we caught him watching the National Geographic channel on TV,’ Ndaba, 30, said.

‘He looked at Lewanika and said, “Come, come.” The old man’s face lit up when he saw him – as you know he loves children. They hugged and my son kept calling him ‘Baba’. It was so touching seeing them together.’

Ndaba, chairman of the Africa Rising Foundation dedicated to the economic development of South African youth, lives at Mr Mandela’s house in Houghton, Johannesburg, where the former president died last Thursday.

Ndaba said: ‘We are so proud to be able to preserve this special moment, and honoured to show it to the world.’

Mr Mandela’s daughter Zindzi, 53, also told The Mail on Sunday earlier this year how much her father loved having his young relatives around him. She recounted the story of how, on his release from prison, he begged her to stop breastfeeding her son so that he could have the baby in his bedroom, to feed him and care for him each night.

Zindzi said at the time: ‘My father lights up and smiles whenever children are around him. He adores them, and lets them climb all over him.’

The final picture emerged as Mr Mandela succumbed to a chronic lung infection first diagnosed during his long prison days when he spent months in isolation in a dark damp cell.

His condition rapidly worsened early last week when his eldest daughter Makaziwe, from his first marriage, told of her sorrow at seeing her father ‘on his deathbed’.

Yesterday Ndaba, the first family member to speak publicly since Mr Mandela’s passing, told of his ‘great sadness’ but added: ‘There is a sense of relief too that he is finally in a better place. It has been very comforting to know that there are millions and millions of people around the world who share our sadness. I have seen all the flowers outside the house, it is unbelievable.’

Of the photograph, Ndaba added: ‘One day I will tell my boy about his famous great-grandfather and the picture will be very special to him.’

Loss: Ndaba said his son will one day be old enough to understand the power of his grandfather and of the poignant photograph

 He recalled that Mr Mandela was sitting in his favourite chair in the comfortable sitting-room of his home, surrounded by prized books and photographs, when he brought the boy to him.

At the time doctors were concerned at his worsening heart condition; his swollen hands, a symptom of his illness, are clearly visible in the picture.

Within weeks he suffered a medical emergency in the middle of the night and was taken to a cardiac clinic in Pretoria where he remained for three months. In the picture, Mr Mandela is demonstrably happy and animated to be in the company of his great-grandson.

‘When he was born, I asked the old man what we should call him,’ recalled Ndaba. ‘And my grandfather said Ngubencuka which is the name of one of our ancestors. I must say I was already set on Lewanika but we gave him Ngubencuka as a middle name.’

ON his grandfather’s death, Ndaba became the most prominent male member of the Mandela clan. ‘Personally I now feel under a lot of pressure,’  he said.

‘We are the ones left to carry the name, perhaps me in particular. So many close friends in messages of condolence have said things such as, “You have to step up now, brother”.’

Ndaba was in Brazil representing his country at the World Cup draw when he heard the news about his grandfather. ‘I had only just arrived at the place when my aunt rang me. We came home immediately.’

Family ties: Nelson Mandela's youngest child Zindzi, portrayed with him 201, has spoken of how her father begged to care for her son

He said that around ‘90 per cent’ of the family gathered at Mr Mandela’s home which stands on a street lined  with jacaranda trees in the wealthy suburb.

‘It has been sad but everyone has been busy feeding relatives and organising all sorts of things. We had a big family meal today which was good.’

Among those who spent the day at the house was Mr Mandela’s  second wife Winnie. His third wife Graca Machel was at his bedside when he died, along with several of his grandchildren, and tribal elders from the Xhosa community. They were joined by a priest who conducted the the last rites.

One sentiment expressed repeatedly by South Africans over the past few days is that Mr Mandela, their liberator who freed them from the oppression of racial apartheid by sacrificing himself to 27 years in prison, was a fighter to the end. He surprised his many supporters, friends and family members by surviving his 95th birthday in July. At the same time, some have expressed concern that in the final months he was kept alive only by ventilators and was given dialysis for failing kidney activity. He was said to be receiving nutrition and sedatives intravenously and unable to talk.

Mr Mandela had six children, three of whom pre-deceased him. One was his son Makgatho Lewanika Mandela, who died of an AIDS-related illness in 2005, aged 55.  Makgatho’s grandson – in the photograph with Mr Mandela – was given his middle name.

In all there are 17 grandchildren and 13 surviving great-grandchildren. Zenani, daughter of Mandela’s granddaughter Zoleka, died in a  car crash on the eve of the opening ceremony for the 2010 football world cup held in South Africa. She was 13.

Ndaba said: ‘We are a big family and we will be here for the next few days. The first big event will be the memorial service on Tuesday. As for the funeral on Sunday, I am sure there will a few heads of state attending. I know that Obama said he wants to come and the president of France wants to come, and all dignitaries from over Africa.

‘I haven’t heard about who is  coming from England.’
