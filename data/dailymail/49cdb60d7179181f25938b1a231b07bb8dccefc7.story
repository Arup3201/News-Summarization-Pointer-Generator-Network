British scientists are stranded after their Antarctic base lost power in the depths of winter as temperatures plummeted to a record low of minus 55C.

There is no way of rescuing the 13 researchers from the Halley VI Research Station - which has been hit by a 19-hour blackout - for months until the hostile winter subsides.

The British Antarctic Survey admitted it was a 'serious incident' and has suspended all experiments as the workers heat up emergency accommodation which has not been used for months.

Trapped: Temperatures plummeted on the British Halley VI Research Station in Antarctica in the depths of winter after 13 researchers experienced a 19-hour power cut. There is no way they can be rescued (file photo)

Warming up: Workers maintain a generator at the site, around which temperatures dropped to minus 55C

Remote: The research station was completed in 2012 and consists of 'modules' on hydraulic movable legs

Some of the fallout from the power cut, which happened a week ago but was only revealed today, is still ongoing as the workers face sleeping on the floor of a garage. 

But despite the perilous conditions the scientists, 10 English, one Scottish, one Romanian and one Polish, have remained upbeat - and even Tweeted about their ordeal.

Renewable energy engineer Anthony Lister wrote: 'Whilst all the fun was happening at #halley6 (not that it's over) we had the lowest ever recorded temps down here at -55.4. Which was nice.

'Got internet, lots of @YorkshireTea tea and a big kettle. Really, what more do you actually need?' 

He added on his blog: 'I would just like to reiterate that we are all healthy, in good spirits and are busy setting about getting, and keeping the station in as good an order as possible.

Nice view: At least the trapped scientists have a good vantage point to watch the patterns of the Aurora

'No one here on station is responsible for the technical issues we are having and we are all working extremely hard.

'Another fairly cool, but problematic at the time, event occurred around the time of us losing power – the coldest temperature ever recorded at Halley Bay.

'Throwing a cup of boiling water into the air resulted in small explosion as the water instantly turned into a cloud of ice crystals.

'This obviously didn’t help us on station at the time but it was nice to see a record set!

A British Antarctic Survey spokesman told MailOnline the temperature inside the building had dropped almost to freezing.

He added: 'We can't get anyone in to help them because it's the winter.'

But he insisted there was no threat to their safety, saying: 'They have a building which is usually used as overspill accommodation for the summer months.

'It's been shut down since the summer, so we're bringing that back into service and slowly warming it up.

'There's also a garage which is heated that they can sleep in. It's not ideal, but it's safe.

'Some people have been saying they're going to freeze to death. That's not going to happen.'

Isolated: The location of the research station in Halley Bay, which has been used by scientists since the 1950s

The state-of-the-art research station opened two years ago on a 150m-thick Brunt Ice Shelf in Halley Bay, Antarctica, where researchers have been based since the 1950s.

Run by the Cambridge-based Survey, it consists of eight 'modules' on hydraulic legs which can lift above huge layers of snow and ice which accumulate in the winter.

The design was an attempt to prevent the fate of previous research bases which were buried under ice and snow during serious weather.

Although the station is completely inaccessible to the outside world, there is an on-site doctor. 

A BAS statement said: 'British Antarctic Survey (BAS) is dealing with a serious operational incident at its Halley Research Station.

'Our urgent priority is to ensure the continued safety and wellbeing of the wintering team.

Inhospitable: The base opened in 2012 after four years' work and is on the 150m-thick Brunt Ice Shelf

State of the art: The research station in calmer weather. It currently has just 13 scientists living in it

'Power and some heating are back online, and some other essential services have been restored, but the staff are having to live and work in extremely difficult conditions. 

'It is now clear that because of the nature of the incident, and the prolonged loss of power, the station cannot now return to normal operation in the short or medium term.

'Everyone at Halley and Cambridge is doing everything that can be done to ensure that the incident remains under control.

'All science, apart from meteorological observations essential for weather forecasting, has been stopped.'
