Around 1,000 anti-government demonstrators have stormed the Royal Thai army headquarters in Bangkok after a planned march to protest against Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra's ruling party on Friday.

The protestors broke through a a padlocked perimeter fence before pouring into the compound and setting up a stage to hold a rally.

Reports from the headquarters say the mob have now driven a truck into the quadrant of the army base and are staging a rally with a public announce system.

They are calling for the overthrow of the regime after Yingluck survived a parliamentary no-confidence vote on Thursday.

Army spokesperson Colonel Sansern Kaewkamnerd said: 'They are inside the courtyard and have not entered any buildings.'

Thousands of protesters are continuing to occupy and protest at strategic parts of the capital including the Finance Ministry and the US embassy

An Army spokesman confirmed the protesters broke a padlock at the gate of the 
compound and then pushed their way inside today.

Colonel Sansern Kaewkamnerd said: 'They are inside the courtyard and have not entered any buildings.'

But armed forces on the ground are said to be standing by and letting the protestors have their say on the understanding that they do not break into any official buildings.

The demonstrations that started on Sunday have raised fears of fresh political turmoil and instability in Thailand.

They pose the biggest threat to Ms Yingluck's administration since she came to power in 2011.

Groups
 of protesters were scattered around Bangkok today. Some are still 
occupying the Finance Ministry, which they stormed on Monday. Others are
 holed up at a sprawling government office compound.

Activists are believed to be challenging the army to declare which side they will be on, if the government is defeated.

The no-confidence vote has failed to pacify protesters 
who accuse Yingluck of abusing her party's majority to push through laws
 that strengthen the behind-the-scenes power of self-exiled brother and 
former premier, Thaksin Shinawatra.

Though the number of protesters appear to be dwindling since the start of the week, a hard-core had remained in the capital determined to target symbols of the 'Thaksin regime'.

Yingluck has ruled out resigning or dissolving parliament.

As the rallies drag on, questions are being raised about what lies ahead in a conflict that broadly pits urban middle classes against the mostly rural supporters of Thaksin, a divisive tycoon ousted in a 2006 military coup and central to Thailand's eight years of on-off turmoil.

Anti-government protest leader Suthep 
Thaugsuban vowed firm action earlier in the week but was unwilling to 
say what that would be.

He told Reuters news agency: 'The end game will happen in the next day or two. All will be revealed tomorrow night'

Yingluck Shinawatra on Thursday called on anti-government demonstrators to hold dialogue with the government, but so far they have refused

Government sources said they would not be provoked into a response which would jeopardise its legitimacy.

Overnight, it has urged police and its supporters to avoid confronting demonstrators it says are running out of steam.

'The government will not instigate a violent situation because that is exactly what Suthep wants', said Udomdet Rattanasatein, a lawmaker from Yingluck's Puea Thai party.

'We will not be provoked.'

A government spokesperson said they would not be provoked into violently disrupting the protest because that would be playing into the hands of the activists
