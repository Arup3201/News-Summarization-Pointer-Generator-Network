Manson was jailed for five years in 2003 after attempting a similar £17million fraud.

A lawyer who posed as a wealthy investor to con two venture capitalists out of £250,000 has been jailed for six years.

Gordon Manson, 48, from Edinburgh, used the cash in an attempt to negotiate the takeover of a business worth £19million.

His scam was only foiled when the owner of the company mentioned the deal to a friend over drinks and was told Manson was a conman.

Jailing him at the Old Bailey, Judge Brian Barker, the Common Serjeant of London, told Manson: 'Your whole lifestyle has been self-centred and based on dishonesty and self-delusion.'

He added: 'You gave every appearance that your 
interest in that company was genuine, using professional advisers.

'Subsequently your true identity was discovered and you were arrested.

‘You were financing these activities 
on the back of two loans from venture finance companies. This was 
fraudulent from the outset and professionally planned.’

The Old Bailey heard Manson first made an approach to invest in Avanta, a serviced office company, in late 2010.

Posing as Fraser Henderson, he claimed he was ‘cash rich’ with a portfolio of serviced offices outside London.

In May 2012 he made another approach 
to buy the business and met with the owner David Alberto at the Westbury
 Hotel in Mayfair to discuss the deal.

Manson claimed he ran a property 
investment business and spent most of his time in Andorra and Madrid.

He
 also claimed that he had access to a £50million fund to invest, although prosecutor Antony Swift said there is not believed to be any truth to the claims.

Mr Alberto spent £80,000 in professional fees relating to the deal before learning ‘Henderson’ was in fact a conman named Gordon Manson.

In 2003, Manson, a qualified solicitor, was jailed for five years in 2003 after attempting a similar £17million fraud in Edinburgh.

After the discovery, Mr Alberto contacted police and then arranged a meeting with Manson at an office in London so the fraudster could be arrested.

Old Bailey Judge Brian Barker said Manson based his life on 'dishonesty and self-delusion' as he jailed him for six years

Manson later admitted that he had obtained loans worth £250,000 in order to finance the acquisition of Avanta, including £100,000 from Jeremy Keith and £150,000 from Zafir Rafiq.

Both loans were backed by personal guarantees which had been falsified by Manson.

Mr Swift said: ‘He used false documentation about his own financial worth and false accounts, all giving the impression he was a man of substance when he was in fact a man of straw.

‘His explanation was the deal could have worked and nobody would have lost anything. The Crown say that is simply untrue.

‘Clearly when a fraudster like the defendant is looking to buy a company like Avanta the risk is once he gets his foot in the door he will use its good standing in order to fleece them and line his pockets.’

Defence barrister Wayne Cleaver said all of the money had been spent on surveyors, lawyers and ‘other expenses’ and there was nothing left.

Manson pleaded guilty to three counts of fraud by false representation.

The judge sentenced him to 32 months for the Avanta fraud.

He was also sentenced for 40 months for each of the bridging loan frauds to be served concurrently.
