All but two casinos in Atlantic City are back in business after a near five-day shutdown for Superstorm Sandy and despite much of the city remaining without power. 

Governor Chris Christie announced at 10am Friday that he was rescinding an order that had closed the casinos in preparation for Sandy, while also lifting the mandatory evacuation order for Atlantic City residents.

The Golden Nugget moved quickly to start recouping its losses, opening 90 minutes after the governor's order. Nine others prepared to open later in the day as the struggling gambling industry scrambled to restart after a second forced shutdown in two years.

Golden Nugget general manager Tom 
Pohlman has described business as ‘surprisingly strong’ and said there 
were lines prior to opening for the slot machines and the buffet. 

Collectively, Atlantic City’s 12 casinos are estimated to have lost about $5million each day in gambling revenue.

The Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa, 
the Tropicana Casino and Resort and the two Trump casinos planned to 
open late this afternoon.

Of the remaining two casinos, Revel plans to open at noon Saturday and the Atlantic Club on Monday.

Among the first customers at Golden 
Nugget was 63-year-old Joyce Dean, who lives in Atlantic City. ‘I was 
cooped up with my sister,’ she said. ‘I'm so happy to get out and resume
 my daily visit to Golden Nugget.’

Pohlman said he understands that some
 gamblers are more focused on recovery than diversions. But he said 
reopening will help employees.

'We employ a large majority of the 
people that live in Atlantic City and surrounding barrier islands,’ he 
said. ‘Unfortunately, our people don't get paid if they don't work.’

The Division of Gaming Enforcement 
has assigned investigators and personnel to each casino to ensure 
compliance with safety procedures.

‘The Director has indicated that a 
complete review and assessment of the status and condition of each 
casino property, including the casino floors, its equipment, 
surveillance, security and gaming related computer systems have been 
completed,’ said Governor Christie.

On Thursday, Christie had said that 
although Atlantic City's 12 casinos all had electricity, they wouldn’t 
be allowed to reopen until drinking water in the city was found to be 
safe and power restored to the rest of the city.

The casinos are scrambling to arrange to bring employees into the city that has been shut down since Sunday.

Atlantic City was in the direct line of Sandy’s path and suffered mass devastation from the rising sea swell and rapid winds.

Now it's reopening, traffic congestion could be a major problem.

The storm made landfall with hurricane force winds just a few miles from Atlantic City on Monday.

The city was flooded and an old 
section of its famous boardwalk - the nation's first - was wrecked in 
the storm, though other parts of New Jersey's coast were hit even 
harder. 

Willie Glass, the city's public safety director, said: 'The city's basically flooded. Most of the city is under water.' 

It was only the fourth shutdown in the 34 years that New Jersey has had casinos. 

Last year, casinos were closed when 
Tropical Storm Irene hit the coast. That three-day shutdown, which came 
on a busy summer weekend, cost the city $45million in lost business.

The only other closures were for Hurricane Gloria in 1985 and a state government shutdown in 2006.

The casinos have been on a losing 
streak over the last several years during a sour economy and because of 
increased competition from neighboring states.
