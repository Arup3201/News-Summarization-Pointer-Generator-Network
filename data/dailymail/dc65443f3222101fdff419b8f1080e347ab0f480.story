A healthy 15-year-old boy suddenly collapsed and died of an unknown illness while on a school band trip to Disneyland, California.

Joseph Tutaj described as a 'wonderful boy' by his mother, Eileen, was taken unwell just two days into the Seaford High School trip.

The popular trumpet player had enjoyed his first day at the Anaheim theme park, going on rides such as Space Mountain as one of a group of 80 band-mates, when he suddenly fell ill.

Mystery death: Joseph Tutaj, 15, died on a school trip to Disneyland. He suffered a high fever and illness before collapsing - dying in hospital a day later

Popular: Joseph Tutaj has been remembered by friends at Seaford High School. He was said to be a kind teenager who loved his role playing the trumpet with the school band

He continued to brave the illness until he collapsed in front of terrified school friends on a day trip to Santa Monica pier.

He was rushed to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center but died 24 hours later on Tuesday, February 19.

His mother was in New York's JFK airport waiting to fly out to be with him when she was told he had died.

'This was supposed to be such a great trip for him,' she told Long Island Newsday. 'He couldn't wait to go.'

It is the third tragedy to befall the Tutaj family from Seaford, Long Island.

Joseph's father Robert is suffering with advance stage cancer and the family's home was destroyed in Hurricane Sandy.

Robert Tutaj told Longisland.com
 that his teenage son had been a tower of strength to his parents and 
sister Emily as they were moved to temporary housing in Bethpage 
following the flooding of their home.

He said the 6-foot-2 sophomore was a 'gentle giant' and 'the light of his life'.

As well as his love for the marching band, Joseph has been remembered for his kindness and love of video games and scouting.

Touching tributes have been left by dozens of school friends on Facebook tribute sites and they also gathered for a prayer service on Thursday.

They are also raising money to support the family and plan to hold an event in Joseph's memory. 

The teen's best friend Dominick Porcelli wrote to his family in one of his posts.

'The pain in my heart for the loss of a friend,
 my friend and all of Joseph Tutaj friends, will never amount to the 
parents broken heart,' he wrote.

'Joe was an amazing person and will always be remembered as such, you 
should be proud of him, and [he] will always have a spot in his friends 
heart, because he has made a big impact on everyone because he was the 
nicest kid in the school.'

Fellow band-member Tracy De Leon wrote on Thursday: 'Joe, today in band we all played for you, everyone cried for you, we all are gong to miss you.'

His death has rocked the small community of Seaford and the cause of his death has baffled his family and friends.

He said he felt ill and was suffering a high fever but had no previous health problems or known allergies.

'He was fine the first day, and then he was complaining of a fever and 
not feeling well the next day, and then he progressively got worse,' 
said Shannon Fredericks, a classmate told NBC.

'He looked 
really sick.'

Initial tests couldn't establish why he had died. A full post-mortem will be held later today.

Seaford School District Superintendent Brian Conboy told Longisland.com: 'It’s 
devastating news. It was a terrible shock for the entire community and 
we’re going to do our best to support Joseph’s family. It’s a pretty 
senseless and unspeakable tragedy.'
