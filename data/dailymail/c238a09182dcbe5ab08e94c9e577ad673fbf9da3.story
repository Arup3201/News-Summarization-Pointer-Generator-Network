Russell Brand has said that he still 'adores' his wife Katy Perry despite filing for divorce from her yesterday after just 14 months of marriage.

In a sentimental statement he informed that the couple were ending their marriage, but said he hoped that they would remain friends.

It came as the 36-year-old comedian stepped out looking downcast without his wedding ring on in London yesterday.

It's over: Russell Brand, pictured yesterday in London without his wedding ring, has filed for divorce from his wife Katy Perry

Brand said in his 
statement: 'Sadly, Katy and I are ending our marriage. I'll always
 adore her and I know we'll remain friends.'

His legal team filed court documents at the Superior Court in Los Angeles yesterday citing 'irreconcilable differences.'

The divorce documents, which refer to
 Perry by her give name Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson, show there are 
'community property assets,' suggesting there may not be a pre-nuptial 
agreement in place.

It does not list a date of separation.

Perry is yet to comment on the split 
and there is some speculation she was blind-sided by Brand's official 
move to end their marriage.

It has also been said that Brand didn't approve of her partying lifestyle and new claims suggest that he told her to 'tone it down'.

The recovered drug and sex addict is said to have disapproved strongly 
of her benders – such as a long day-into-night party in Rio earlier this
year.

He also never apparently liked her 
friends such as the fun-loving singer Rihanna.

The pair sparked rumours of trouble 
after celebrating Christmas 7,000 miles apart - he spent the festive day
 in Cornwall while the Teenage Dream singer, 27, was with friends in 
Hawaii.

Perry was not wearing her wedding ring either when she was photographed frolicking in the surf on December 25.

The couple's split comes just four weeks after Brand declared his relationship was going strong.

He told Ellen DeGeneres on December 2: 'I'm really happily 
married. I’m married to Katy. Perpetually, until death do us part was
 the pledge. I’m still alive.'

In November, Perry told the same TV host that that she 'would love to have children' with Brand.

She
 said: 'I think that's one of the reasons you get married, especially to
 the person that you marry. You think: "That person is going to be a 
good partner, a good parent.'''

Asked if she wanted a big family, Perry added: 'If it doesn't hurt the first time I'll keep popping them out.'

But there was clearly trouble brewing when the pair decided to spend Christmas apart, allegedly after a huge row.

A source was quoted as telling Us Weekly magazine: 'They had a massive fight. She was like, "F*** you.
 I'm going to do my own thing."

Meanwhile the insider said that Russell replied: 'Fine, f*** you too.'

The
 couple had planned Christmas together and Perry was expected to jet her family in a private plane over to the UK to 
celebrate.

In November, Brand's mother Barbara 
had tweeted she was looking forward to spending the festive season with 
her son and daughter-in-law.

She wrote on Twitter: 'Spoke to Russell and Katy, they are so happy, it's lovely. We will all be together for Christmas.'

The California-born star began dating
 the British comedian in 2009 after she famously threw a bottle at his 
head at an MTV Music Awards party.

He proposed just four months later on New Year's Eve and they were married in October last year.

Their lavish ceremony at a five-star resort in India included two elephants, acrobats and jugglers.

Brand was once notorious in England as a hard-partying bachelor and self-confessed sex addict.

He later had a spiritual awakening and got sober after years of heroin and alcohol abuse.

He insisted he'd reformed his wild ways before settling down with Perry.

'I think I was ready for it,' he 
said. 'If you're wild, like a wild animal, marriage won't contain you. I
 think that's how a lot of people get into trouble.'

Brand will next appear in the Eighties musical film, Rock Of Ages, alongside Tom Cruise.

Perry, who has spent much of the year on tour, recently released the new single The One That Got Away.

The track is currently number three on the US charts. If it reaches number one, it will be her sixth chart-topping single from her Teenage Dream album, surpassing the record set by Michael Jackson's Bad.

date, I changed. No more women. Well, actually, thousands of women. I

If they do, it does not cover all of the earnings and other assets they accumulated during their brief marriage.

The couple have at least three properties together - including a $6.5m Hollywood home they purchased in June.

They are also understood to own a $2.7m apartment in Manhattan's trendy TriBeca as well as a residence in London.

Brand asks in the papers that 'attorney fees and costs will be payable by each party to advance his/her own without prejudice.'
