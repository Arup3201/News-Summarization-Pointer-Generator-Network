Fugitive: Mental health patient Ian McLean who is serving life for stabbing his partner escaped to Poland for a week

A prisoner serving a life  sentence for repeatedly stabbing his girlfriend was able to flee abroad after a doctor signed his passport application.

Ian McLean, 44, walked out of a mental health facility and boarded a Eurostar train to Belgium.

He spent more than an hour in Brussels before anyone noticed he was missing.

The career criminal then travelled to Berlin before moving on to the Polish  seaside resort of Kolobrzeg.

His escape forced police officers to place Michelle Storer – the ex-lover he stabbed – in protective custody.

McLean was jailed for life in 2004 after he admitted stabbing Miss Storer, 37, all over her body.

He stopped only when the handle of the knife broke, and then  whispered ‘die’ in her ear.

Miss Storer was stabbed so many times that doctors were unable to count the number of individual wounds.

McLean spent some of his sentence in Bullingdon Prison near Bicester, Oxfordshire, before being transferred to a secure mental institution to treat an ‘extreme personality disorder’.

He was then sent to an unlocked ward at Littlemore Mental Health Centre in Oxford.

While at Littlemore, he persuaded a doctor to sign his application for a passport, which he later used to escape to Europe.

McLean was finally arrested in Kolobrzeg, 300 miles north-west of Warsaw, after eight days on the run.

A major inquiry has been launched into how Oxford Health, the NHS Trust that runs Littlemore, allowed a dangerous prisoner to escape.

Miss Storer, a mother of two from Banbury, said her former boyfriend should never have been placed in an open mental unit.

She said: ‘When the officers came to the house and told me he’d escaped and they needed to take us to a safe house, I just burst into tears.

‘I asked, “How has this happened,” but they said they didn’t know. I was scared to death – not knowing where he was or if he’d come back to finish the job.

'I don’t believe he should ever be put in an open unit as he will do it again.’

Oxford MP Nicola Blackwood added: ‘This is a deeply worrying incident.’

Detectives said McLean booked a taxi on his mobile phone while inside the mental unit.

At 1am on July 8, he paid the driver £100 take him to St Pancras Station in London where he boarded the Eurostar to Brussels.

He arrived in the Belgian capital just after 9am – more than an hour before police in Oxford were told by the mental unit that he was missing. Police then circulated his picture through Interpol.

British officers, working with their Polish counterparts, captured McLean in Kolobrzeg eight days later.

Detective Chief Inspector Mark Johns, who led the manhunt, said: ‘I am really pleased we managed to get him so quickly.

‘Throughout the whole investigation I was very conscious he was in a foreign country, not under any treatment and I was concerned what risk he posed.

'The Polish police were under no illusion as to the potential risk.’

Oxford Health has apologised to Miss Storer and has launched an investigation into how McLean escaped.

A spokesman said: ‘We have sent a letter expressing our apologies to her and are offering her the opportunity to meet with senior staff to discuss her concerns.

'This man was not deemed to present a substantial risk to the general public, despite his previous offences.’

McLean is being held in a Polish prison and will return to the UK in the next few weeks.
