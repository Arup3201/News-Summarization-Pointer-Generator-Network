An Adelaide mother, who says her one year old daughter was scarred for life after being badly burnt on some play equipment, has taken to social media to warn other parents against the dangers of unprotected play equipment.

One year old Ella Brooks was at the new playground in Semaphore, north west of Adelaide,  on the morning of November 13, with her grandma when she suffered severe burns to her right left after sitting on the 'hurdy gurdy' merry-go-round.

Her mother Amanda Hann, who was clearly distressed by the incident says the 'pictures of the horrific burn speak for themselves'.

On a 26/27 degree day this merry-go-round at a Semaphore playground got so hot it badly burnt a one year old girl

In a Facebook post she said the day was only about 26 or 27 degrees but the equipment clearly hadn't been made to withstand warm days, 'let alone the Australian sun'.

'Several trips to the hospital for treatment and constant dressing, not to mention the care and strain on us at home to keep the area clean and dressed 24/7 with a highly active toddler,' she said.

'She is only one year old and is now scarred for life and this has ruined her whole summer as she cannot do water activities or play in sandpits etc. because the area is so sensitive'.

In her post she has warned other parents to be 'Beware of the new Semaphore playground' claiming they are a risk to any child who climbs/falls/sits onto the checkerboard surface.

'I don't want any other child to suffer the way mine has,' she said. 

The post went viral and has been shared more than 14,000 times, with a variety of comments from concerned and angry parents.

The post went viral and saw a number of comments from concerned and angry parents

The post was shared nearly 14,000 times and incited plenty of comments who were worried about the one year old

Some users gave some advice about what to do when at a playground

Some were angry the play equipment wasn't checked before kids were able to use it

One mother wondered why they didn't have shade over the playground while another commented that parents should check the playground by feeling equipment, just to be over cautious.

Many felt very sorry for little Ella while others felt Ms Hann should look into claiming compensation after the incident.

Following the overwhelming response, Port Adelaide Enfield council cordoned off the piece of play equipment. 

Acting technical services director, Robert Tiggemann said the playground was upgraded this year and opened to the public early September.

'The playground is compliant with Australian Standards and has shade over parts of the playground and cost approximately $480,000 and was manufactured by a German Company,' he said.

'We understand the Company supply playgrounds all over the world.'

Port Adelaide Enfield council cordoned the play equipment off after complaints after hearing of the incident

Mr Tiggemann said the council were alerted to the incident on Tuesday, November 25 following the information being posted to Facebook. 

'We understand the incident occurred on 13th November and we believe the child was about 1 year old, the forecast on the 13th November was 38 degrees in Adelaide,' he said.

'Neither the parents of the child or anyone else has contacted the Council regarding the matter.'

But council took action and closed down the 'Hurdy Gurdy' and organised a spongy rubber coating to be installed and it is now open again for kids to use.

A local mum who has taken her kids to the playground on many occasions told Daily Mail Australia she believes there are a couple of really poor designs within the park.

'There's a flying fox that most kids can't reach and the bigger ones that can swing so low their legs touch the ground,' she said.

'There's also a great climbing wall but it's positioned in a spot so that it blocks a lot of your view which means you can lose sight of where your kids are.'

'You'd think if you were going to pour so much money into a playground in such an important location for the suburb they'd get it right!'
