More the remains of more than 160 migrants who died crossing the U.S. border have been found in an unmarked mass grave in South Texas.

Bodies at Sacred Heart Burial Park in Falfurrias were found in shopping bags, trash bags or no bags at all. Skulls were dumped in bio-hazard bags and buried separately from the rest of the remains. Some bodies were piled on top of each other, other even found in the same bag. One set of remains was found wrapped in a kitchen garbage bag stuffed in a a plastic shopping bag that said 'Dignity' - a slogan from a funeral home.

The remains are believed to be migrants who died in the brush after illegally making the dangerous trek across the U.S.-Mexico border 80 miles south of Falfurrias. Most were found in states of decay by local sheriff's deputies.

Many of the remains were found under 
simple markers bearing the name of local funeral home Funeraria del 
Angel Howard-Williams. Authorities in rural Brooks and Jim Hogg Counties
 said they paid the business $450 to bury each unidentified migrant 
found dead, the Corpus Christi Caller-Times reports.

The funeral home and its corporate owners in Houston, Service Corporation International, refused to confirm whether Howard-Williams was responsible for the burials.

Bishop Emeritus René Gracida of the Diocese of Corpus Christi told the Caller-Times that the burials were 'truly anti-civilized' and 'barbaric.'

Immigrant advocates are furious. Eddie Canales told the newspaper that even in death, the immigrants were denied the proper respect.

'I think it’s very hard for people to connect in the fact that these were human beings,' he said.

'It just goes to the language, to the words, and words mean a lot: "All these were illegals."'

Now, the Texas Rangers have launched an investigation into the burials and a state representative has said the discovery could result in criminal charges.

'It’s an 
absolute disgrace and disrespectful,' State Representative Terry 
Canales, who represents the district which Falfurrias is a part of, told
 Fox News. 'No matter what side of the borders they are from, these are human beings.

'It’s no excuse to disrespect someone in the way these bodies were.'

Canales
 has filed a request to be given access to Brooks County's financial 
records to see the amount of funds spent on burying the 162 bodies 
exhumed so far, he told the network.

The bodies are believed to be migrants who died during the dangerous illegal border crossing between the United States and Mexico

'Without question there was some sort of fraudulent act,' he insisted.

The Texas Department of Public Safety issued a statement Monday saying investigators from the Texas Rangers have also become involved in an investigation into improprieties.

'The Texas Rangers discussed the situation with Brooks County officials today,' an official said. 'Another meeting is scheduled tomorrow in Austin with a variety of local and state officials to determine the proper course of action.'

The 
discovery was initially made two weeks ago by Baylor University 
anthropologist Lori Baker and Krista Latham, a forensic anthropologist at 
the University of Indianapolis, and their students.

The
 group was working as part of a multi-year effort to identify immigrants
 who have died in the area near the U.S.-Mexico border.

They exhumed 110 unidentified people from the cemetery in 2013. This summer, researchers have performed 52 exhumations, but because some remains were stored together, further study will be needed to determine exactly how many bodies have been recovered, Baker said.

Proper burial: The bodies will be examined and cross-checked with DNA sent from Mexico and Central American countries, with the goal of reuniting the remains with families

Researchers
 told the Caller-Times that some remains were found under small, 
temporary grave markers bearing the name of local funeral home Funeraria
 del Angel Howard-Williams.

Brooks
 and Jim Hogg county officials said they pay the funeral home to handle 
bodies recovered in the remote parts of South Texas, an area that's 
often deadly for immigrants from Mexico and Central America who set out 
on foot through ranchlands amid sweltering temperatures to avoid a 
nearby U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint.

More
 than 300 people died crossing through Brooks County alone between 2011 
to 2013 - representing more than 50 per cent of the deaths in Texas' 
sprawling Rio Grande Valley.

Brooks County Chief Deputy Benny Martinez said the funeral home charges $450 to handle each body. County Judge Raul Ramirez said it been handling such remains for at least 16 years. Chief Sheriff's Deputy Lorenzo Benavides in neighboring Jim Hogg County says the practice has been going there as long as he can remember, at least 22 years.

A message left Saturday at Howard-Williams was not immediately returned. The funeral home referred the newspapers' questions to its parent company, Houston-based Service Corporation International.

Texas Democratic state Rep. Terry Canales said Sunday, June 22, 2014, that the graves should be secured by state police until a criminal investigation can be completed

'No matter
 if this is one of our client families we serve on a traditional basis 
or a migrant family's loved one we're serving and we don't have any 
identification of the loved one, I do want to let you know it is our 
policy to treat the decedent with care, to treat them just like we would
 treat anyone else,' Service Corporation International Spokeswoman 
Jessica McDunn told the newspaper.

McDunn
 said the funeral home has 'certain records related to these burials, 
but this does not amount to confirmation that Howard-Williams was 
involved in depositing the remains in the manner the researchers 
described.'

The funeral home would not give the newspaper access to those records.

Still, Latham called the discovery appalling. Baker said bodies that were not already skeletonized before burial were found in varying states of decomposition.

'To me it's just as shocking as the mass grave that you would picture in your head, and it's just as disrespectful,' Latham told the Caller Times.
