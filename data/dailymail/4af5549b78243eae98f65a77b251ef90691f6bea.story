Upon inspection of the property, detectives found a grave that had been dug but not used.

It is believed that Mr Michniewicz was killed following a fight involving three white males on an evening two or three weeks ago.

A spokesman for Scotland Yard described the discovery as 'a large hole, big enough for a body, in the garden at the rear of the property'.

Two people, a 20-year-old man and 17-year-old woman, who are understood to be residents of the same house, have been arrested in connection with the death.

Both have been bailed until later this month.

Detective Chief Inspector Noel McHugh of the Homicide and Major Crime Command said: 'I am keen to hear from anyone who may have seen anything suspicious at the address or who may have some information.

'I also want to hear from anyone who stayed at or visited the property in the last few weeks.'
