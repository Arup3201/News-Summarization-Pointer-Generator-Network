Nicholas Overton, 35, who committed a string of robberies after escaping from a prison work placement, has been jailed for six years today

An escaped convict who went on a four-week crime spree after he was released from prison to go for 'work experience' was jailed for six years today.

Nicholas Overton, 35, stole from at least three shops over the course of 28 days after taking £1,500 from a photo printing business he was supposed to be working for.

Overton, originally from Sheffield, South Yorks, had been jailed for 18 years in 2006 for a string of gunpoint robberies across five counties.

When he was last in court a judge told him he would have to serve eight years before being considered for parole, but in August, seven years into his term, Overton was allowed out of HMP Thorn Cross, Cheshire, to complete a work placement.

After working the day shift at Max Spielman, in Chester, Overton disappeared and then went on a robbery spree across two counties.

On September 12, at a Co-Op near Crewe, Overton walked into the store and pretended to be buying a pint of milk

However, when he got to the till he pulled out a 6in blade and leaned over to take money from behind the counter.

The
shop assistant fought back and 
during a struggle Overton’s watch fell off and landed in the cash drawer. 
Police matched DNA left on it to files they held on the criminal.

A
blue green Audi A6 was also seen in the area at the time and it was later found at
a flat where Overton was staying.

After
the case Det Insp Robert Hassall of Cheshire Police said: 'Our initial 
thoughts were that the robberies weren’t connected.

'Knifepoint robberies tend to be localised and these were happening in two different towns and in a different county.

'As
the investigation progressed, the method of crime, clothing and further
enquiries led officers to believe they were in fact connected.

'A lot of work went into identifying how they could be linked, in order to gather enough evidence to get a breakthrough.

This Co-Op store in Thornton Square, Macclesfield, is thought to be one of the shops raided by Overton

'There
is a lot of work that goes on in the background in complicated 
investigations such as this, which the public don’t get to see. Now we 
are seeing a dangerous man back behind bars.'

The fugitive was eventually captured by armed police in a dawn raid on a house in Crewe.

After pleading guilty to three robberies at Chester Crown Court, Overton also asked for seven other robberies, one burglary, two thefts from motor vehicles and an attempted theft of £7,000 to be taken into consideration.

Overton was originally branded a 'significant risk' to the public when he received an 18-year sentence at Sheffield Crown Court for 23 gunpoint robberies carried out on shops over two-months.

He and an accomplice were said to have got a 'sick thrill' from their crimes.

Though total haul from all the crimes was just £8,500, several victims, who thought they were going to be shot, were too afraid to return to work.

The men were caught after their getaway car was spotted in Sheffield.

South Yorkshire Police described their crime spree as a 'particularly protracted and worrying series of armed robberies.'

Before his most recent spree Overton was at the 321 inmate Thorn Cross open jail, where prison accommodation consists of single rooms, with each prisoner having his own room key.

He was allowed out on August 23 to work at a Max Spielman’s branch in Chester as part of the jail’s partnership with national and local employers.

He was due back at the jail that night after a day working at the shop but the alarm was raised when he failed to report back to prison staff.
