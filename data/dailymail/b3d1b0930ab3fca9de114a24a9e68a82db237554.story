Australia has scored some real estate on the 80th anniversary World Edition of Monopoly - but it's not exactly in a prime position.

Along with 21 other cities, Sydney has been given a spot on the map which replaces London's swankiest postcodes with the world's chicest hotspots. 

However Sydney has been placed right beside the jail in the less desirable magenta part of the board, next to Amsterdam and New York.

Australia has been included in the 80th anniversary version of Monopoly 

Lima was given the pride of place on the board, replacing trendy Mayfair in the dark blue corner.   

The shortlist of cities who made the winning board were revealed on March 19, the Monopoly brand's official birthday. 

For the first time, fans were given the power to decide which 20 cities around the world  featured property spaces for the game, which will be available to buy in September.

In 1933, Charles Darrow made a prototype of the new game using materials from around his home. 

He used a piece of oilcloth that had been a table covering for the game’s board, cut the houses and hotels out of scraps of wooden moulding and typed the deeds and cards.

To celebrate its 70th anniversary in 2005, Hasbro invited fans of the game to help update the board in their respective countries to reflect what the game board would look like if it were created today instead of in 1935. 

The votes resulted in Here & Now editions of the game in each country  

Out of the 80 global destinations up for grabs in the World Edition, London and Sydney both made the cut.

Since it was released, the world famous tycoon game has been played in 114 countries around the world

Subtitled 'The Fast-Dealing Property Trading Game', it is named after the economic concept of monopoly—the domination of a market by a single entity.

It is produced by the US game and toy company Hasbro.

Players move around the gameboard buying or trading properties, developing their properties with houses and hotels, and collecting rent from their opponents, with the goal being to drive them into bankruptcy. 

The most expensive version of the game was produced by celebrated San Francisco jeweller Sidney Mobell. Valued at $2 million, the set features a 23-carat gold board and diamond-studded dice.

More than six billion little green houses and 2.25 billion red hotels have been 'constructed' since 1935. 

The traditional Monopoly gameboard consists of 40 spaces containing 28 properties (22 coloured streets, four railway stations and two utilities), three Chance spaces, three Community Chest spaces, a Luxury Tax space, an Income Tax space, and the four corner squares: GO, In Jail/Just Visiting, Free Parking, and Go to Jail.

In February, the company behind the game, Hasbro, announced a competition called Monopoly Here & Now and asked fans to vote for which cities should be included.

Participants had until midnight on Wednesday 4 March to rally behind their  favourite cities for the coveted Mayfair and Park Lane spots. 

For the 80th anniversary edition competitors will race round the board, and visit as many locations as possible, collecting passport stamps along the way. Players will collect cash from visitor fees when opponents land on their locations and the first player to fill their passport wins

During a special Wild Card Week from Tuesday 3 March to Monday 9 March, fans were also able to request other locations, big or small, which were not featured on the list of options. 

The cities with the most submissions during that week were placed in the infamous Old Kent Road and Whitechapel Road slots on the family board game.

The rules will vary slightly from the traditional version, which has been played by more than one billion people in 114 countries around the world.

Competitors will race around the board, and visit as many locations as possible, collecting passport stamps along the way. 

Players will collect cash from visitor fees when opponents land on their locations and the first player to fill their passport wins.

The game board will differ to normal Monopoly, so it will have a different number of squares and no stations or utilities. 

The board game is loved by people all of the world, including Cindy Crawford (right), and has been played over one billion times
