Jerry Sandusky's adopted son will open up about the years of sexual abuse he endured at the hands of his pedophile father in an exclusive interview with Oprah Winfrey.

Matthew Sandusky's interview, which will air on OWN at 9pm on Thursday night, will be his first television since his father was convicted in 2012.

'At bedtime, his ritual began,' he says in a 30-second preview clip for the show.

Ahead of the show's airing, OWN explained that Matthew would be sharing 'a deeply personal account of the grooming, methodical control and manipulation he faced as a child'.

Speaking out: Matthew Sandusky will detail his abuse at the hands of his father in an interview this week

Brave: He will speak to Oprah Winfrey, right, in his first television interview since the trial in 2012

It adds that Matthew will respond 'to the accusations his adoptive mother, Dottie Sandusky, made on national television accusing him of lying and stealing from the family'.

Sandusky,
 who retired in June 30, 1999 as Penn State's defensive coordinator, was
 convicted in 2012 of molesting 10 boys over 15 years, some in the 
football team's showers on campus.

The 70-year-old is now serving a 30- to 60-year state prison sentence.

Matt Sandusky, one of six children adopted by Jerry and Dottie Sandusky, had been expected to be a defense witness for his father until the trial, when he told investigators that he also had been abused.

His story first
became public when a secret tape of a 29-minute interview he did with police 
during the middle of his father's trial was leaked to NBC.

In the
 tape, Matt said his father would enter his bedroom at night and 'blow 
raspberries' on his stomach, then move his hand down his body, rubbing 
up against his genitals.

He said he would sometimes cower 'in a fetal position' in his bed trying to avoid his father.

In total, he said he suffered seven years of molestation, between the ages of eight and 15, at the hands of his adoptive father. He initially denied there had been any abuse before speaking out.

In an interview for a documentary at the Sundance Film Festival in January, he said that he felt 'betrayed' by the entire Sandusky family after he took the decision to speak out against his father.

But he maintains that he refused to be a 'coward' and risked everything to turn against those who had adopted him from a deprived upbringing and brought him up in an affluent household.

Last year he reached a settlement with Penn State and petitioned to legally change his
 name, and that of his wife and four children.

The interview comes two weeks after Pennsylvania's attorney general released a review of the prosecution but found no evidence of political interference by then Governor Tom Corbett.

The report, however, did reveal three years of 'inexplicable delays' to prosecute the former Penn State football coach on child abuse charges.

The pedophile's home was not searched and the report notes that it took a full year, from March 2009 until March 2010, for the office to recommend charging Sandusky when 'Victim 1' came forward.

It took more 18 months before Sandusky was arrested because the prosecutor's supervisors believed the testimony of one victim would be 'insufficient against a community icon like Sandusky'.
