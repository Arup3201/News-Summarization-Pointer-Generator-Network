When Angus the spaniel decided to go for his winter walkies yesterday, he soon found himself up to his neck in deep trouble.

His chilly surprise came as he nosedived off a wooden table and was buried in snow.

The drift was clearly deeper than the clumsy canine had predicted and it took some seconds for him to emerge and shake off the icy experience.

Here we go: Brave Angus takes a leap off a tabletop in Llyn Brenig, North Wales, where blizzards left a thick blanket of snow that carpeted the ground within a matter of hours

Surprise: But the clumsy canine came a cropper when he was unaware of the depth of the drift and plummeted face first into the snow

Not a hot dog: The cocker spaniel was quick to get back on his feet and well on his way as he continued his walk in the winter wonderland

The cocker spaniel was pictured in Llyn Brenig, North Wales, where blizzards left a thick blanket of snow within a matter of hours and caused severe delays on roads and motorways across the nation. 

Britain is set to face yet more travel problems this week, with sleet and snowstorms expected to last until Tuesday.

The grim weather comes after ‘thundersnow’ storms battered large parts of northern England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland last week.

The weather brought chaos to much of Britain yesterday with winds gusting up to 60mph in Scotland causing blizzard conditions and heavy snow in the north and on higher ground in the south.

Forecast: Temperatures are set to drop over the next few days, as a cold front moves across Britain from north to south, bringing snow and sleet behind it

There was severe disruption on motorways and major roads, with an accident on the M11 to Stansted leaving many frustrated motorists having to walk from the motorway to the airport to get their flights.

Emergency services were on full alert as treacherous driving conditions continued to plague the North West and Scotland – leaving many stranded motorists abandoning their cars.

And temperatures are set to plunge as low as –6C overnight tonight in some parts as a cold front moves across Britain from north to south, bringing snow and sleet behind it.
