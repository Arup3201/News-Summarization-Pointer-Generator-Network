Favoured by the likes of It-models Kendall Jenner, Claudia Schiffer and Gigi Hadid, singer Selena Gomez, and tennis champ Roger Federer, it doesn't get much more A-list than the seven star Burj Al Arab Jumeirah hotel in Dubai.

The stunning building, shaped like a sail, offers intensely luxurious services and facilities throughout, right down to the option to hire a chauffeured Rolls-Royce for the duration of your stay.

The suite-only hotel also boasts in-room check-in, a private reception on each floor and plenty of personal butlers, though it's the hotel's Royal Suite that really take glamour to the utmost extreme. 

Situated on the 25th floor, the opulent offering boasts a lounge, library, cinema room, in-suite elevator and private dining for 12, as well as two master bedrooms and bathrooms.

Guests also have access to a private beach, indoor and outdoor swimming pools and to the hotel's Talise Spa. But they will need to splash out £5,370 ($8,253) a night for the privilege.

Long known for its refined luxury and its private Riviera parkland, it's no surprise that the likes of Cate Blanchett, Jennifer Lopez, Colin Firth and Johnny Depp choose the historic hotel during their jaunts to the South of France.

The 117 guestrooms can be found in three different locations: the main Hotel du Cap, the Eden Roc Pavilion, which overlooks the glittering ocean, and the uber-private Les Deux Fontaines Residence.
