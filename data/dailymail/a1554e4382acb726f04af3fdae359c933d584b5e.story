Cult designer Alexander Wang is to take over at Balenciaga, according to a report in fashion industry bible, Womenswear Daily.

Although neither Wang nor Balenciaga would confirm the appointment, WWD say that market sources have revealed that the appointment is a done deal.

Scottish designer Christopher Kane had been tipped for the role by many in the fashion industry but Wang's simple, structured design ethic has helped him to triumph in the race to replace Nicolas Ghesquière, who leaves the fashion house this week after 15 years at the helm.

Balenciaga is one of the biggest and oldest fashion houses on the 
planet, with offerings that range from ready-to-wear to fragrance.

The label came into existence in 1918, when Spanish designer, Cristóbal Balenciaga, opened his first shop in San Sebastián in Spain.

After the Spanish Civil War forced him to close his shop, Balenciaga decamped to Paris, where he quickly became one of the French capital's top design talents, with Christian Dior describing him as 'the master of us all.'

Following Balenciaga's death in 1972, the house lay dormant until 1986 when it was taken over by the Gucci Group and handed over to designer Michel Goma who reigned for five years before passing on the mantle to Josephus Thimister .

Included in his team was Nicolas Ghesquière who presided over the fashion house for 15 years and was responsible for a period that saw sales soar and legions of celebrity fans come on board.

Today, the brand is best known for its motorcycle inspired handbags, including the 2000 smash hit 'Lariat' bag, while Twilight actress Kirsten Stewart is the face of Balenciaga's current fragrance, Flora Botanica.

Despite Ghesquière's trademark avant-garde aesthetic, the brand regularly dresses the A-list for red carpet events, with fans including actresses Nicole Kidman and Sienna Miller, as well as fashion industry titans such as French Vogue's Emmanuelle Alt and American Vogue supremo, Anna Wintour.

Alexander Wang graduated from New York's Parsons School of Design in 2005 and interned at Teen Vogue before launching his eponymous label. Beginning with a capsule collection of cashmere knitwear, plaudits followed thick and fast, and Wang launched his first full ready-to-wear collection in 2007.  Not far behind was his diffusion line, T by Alexander Wang, which launched in 2009 - the same year that he won the Vogue/CFDA Fashion Fund Award. The 28-year-old opened his debut flagship store in Manhattan in 2011 and remains hugely popular thanks to his chic, pared down designs.
