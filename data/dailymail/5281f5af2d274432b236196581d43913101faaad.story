Apple has given a rare glimpse of its top design design lab where the iPhone and iPad were developed.

Sir Jonathan Ive, the London-born Senior Vice President of Industrial Design for Apple, gave the show a rare glimpse into his lab - although was careful to hide any products.

Instead, he used Apple's expensive milling machinery, usually used to create product prototypes, to make a giant Blue Peter badge for the show - as it honoured him with a gold badge.

Sir Jonathan helped judge a design contest for the show's viewers - and also received a gold Blue Peter badge

The recording was made as part of a gadget special to be screened on the CBBC channel at 10am on Saturday 16 February.

Sir Jonathan confessed to being a life-long Blue Peter fan, and even remembered some of the inventions he had seen, praising their recycling.

In the special episode, Sir Jonathan reviews several product designs sent in by Blue Peter viewers through a series of video messages from the children behind the designs.

Although the firm was able to hide and hint of prototype products in the lab, it does give a rare glimpse into the inner sanctum of Apple's designer.

At one point during the recording, made at the firm's Cupertino headquarters, he takes the presenter to a CNC milling machine, usually used to create aluminium prototypes.

After being presented with the show’s highest accolade, the gold Blue Peter badge, he reveals the machine has been used to create ‘something very special‘, a unique Blue 
Peter badge crafted from solid aluminium through a 10-hour process.

He presented it to the show in true Blue Peter style saying, 'Here’s one that
we made earlier.'

On receiving his gold badge, he called the honour 'absolutely incredible'

Only around 1,000 gold badges have been presented in history and Sir Jonathan Ive joins an illustrious list including David Beckham, JK Rowling, Tom Daley, Damian Hirst and The Queen.
