One of two brothers accused of hiding a video that could potentially help solve the mysterious disappearance of Tennessee nursing student Holly Bobo has angrily denied that it even exists.

Jeffrey Pearcy, who along with his half-brother Mark Pearcy was charged with tampering with evidence last month, has said that since his arrest he has lost his job and cannot provide for his six children.

'I have no video. I have not seen a video, never even heard of the video until I was questioned about it the day of my arrest,' Pearcy said.

Denials: Jeffrey Pearcy said that he does not have a video which could help solve the murder and disappearance of Holly Bobo, has never met her and doesn't know her family

Furthermore, Pearcy claims he has never met Holly - who went missing in April 2011 after being led into woods - doesn't know her family and certainly hasn't met the two men charged with her kidnapping and murder, Zach Adams and Jason Autry.

'As far as me being around anyone that would even be affiliated with anything like that, I wouldn't want to hang around people like that. I work, and I come home and I raise kids,' Pearcy said to WSMV.

However, despite these strong denials, Pearcy stands accused of having watched and owned a video which could lead to convictions in the case of the missing Tennessee nursing student.

'I don't know if they're grasping at straws,' Jeffrey Pearcy said. 'This is the closest thing to a modern-day witch hunt that I've ever seen.'

Two more men have been arrested in connection with the Holly Bobo case, the Tennessee nursing student who went missing on the morning of April 2011

Released with an GPS ankle monitor to track his whereabouts, Pearcy claims to have been fired from his position as a master jeweler - leaving him fearful for the future and his children.

'It's going to cost me the next 25 years of my life that I was planning college, a car. It's taken me from that to where I don't know if I can buy them food next week,' he said to WSMV.

'It's not just something you can get back by them saying, 'I'm sorry.' They have destroyed by life.'

Jeffrey Pearcy says he wants people to know he's an innocent man.

'I have been up front and honest about everything. I have willingly given them everything. Take it, I mean, it's there,' he said.

He also has a message for the Bobo family.

Suspect: Jason Wayne Autry has been charged with the kidnap and murder of Holly Bobo

'My heart goes out to the Bobo family. It could have very well been one of my kids. For someone to give them false hope, and that's exactly what's been done to them,' he said. 'But for the justice system to just haul someone in and destroy their whole life, I mean, there's no sense in that at all.'

According 
to the affidavit for Jeffery Pearcy, investigators believe he has 'shown
 a visual recording on an electronic device to an individual.

'According
 to the witness, this visual recording shows information that will prove
 to be beneficial in the prosecution of a current on-going investigation
 being conducted by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation.'

The affidavit doesn’t mention if the charges are in relation to the Bobo case, reports the Jacksonsun.com.

Investigators believe that Jeffrey Pearcy has possession or has knowledge of where the video is, according to the affidavit.

The
 affidavit states that Jeffrey Pearcy is an 'accessory after the fact 
due to his conduct concerning the concealment of evidence into the 
investigation.'

Tampering with evidence is a Class C Felony and accessory after the fact is a Class E Felony.

Loss: Nursing student Holly Bobo was seen being led from her Tennessee home in April 2011

Threats: Adams appears in court earlier this year over claims he threatened his brother, who is a witness in the case

A
 TBI spokesperson said in a statement, ‘…out of respect for the judicial
 process, we cannot speak to the particular possible pieces of evidence 
in this case. We continue our work to follow the leads wherever they 
might lead. We won’t stop until we find a sense of justice and closure 
for the family and friends of Holly Bobo.’

Mark Pearcy was transferred from Decatur County to Carroll County last week and is also being held without bond.

He was 
also charged with failing to register as a sex offender and unlawful 
possession of a weapon. According to online records, Mark Pearcy registered as a sex offender in 2000 for statutory rape.

The arrests are the latest development since Jason
 Wayne Autry became the second man to be charged with the murder and 
kidnapping of the missing student, who was last seen by her brother 
being led into woods at their home.

Connection: Autry, who is currently serving a three-year sentence for aggravated assault, is described as a long-time friend of Adams

Autry, 39, is a longtime friend of Zachary Adams, who was also charged with her kidnap and murder in March.

Tennesse
 Bureau of Investigation director Mark Gwyn said they have sworn 
statements from witnesses who claim to have seen Miss Bobo alive with 
Autry and Adams after she had been reported missing.

He added that they also had physical evidence being analyzed at two crime laboratories, and several witnesses.

'We believe other individuals have knowledge, and possibly others have involvement,' Mr Gwyn told News Channel 5. 'They can expect us to be on their doorsteps very soon.'

He
 added: 'This is a case the TBI has been continuously working hard to 
solve now for three years. It has not been easy but I do know truth will
 prevail.' 

Charged: Zachary Adams, left, and Jason Wayne Autry, right, are suspected of kidnapping and killing Holly Bobo

'Anyone who had anything to do with Holly's disappearance will be brought to justice,' he added.

The
 first major break in the case came in February, when the Tennessee 
Bureau of Investigation agents and FBI searched several areas around 
Decatur, including the home of Zachary Adams.

Adams, 29, was arrested and charged with kidnapping and murder shortly afterwards.

Miss Bobo's body has never been found.

Adams
 appeared in court in April on charges of coercion of a witness after 
allegedly making threats to his brother who is due to testify against 
him.

Adams' brother allegedly told the FBI he had seen Miss Bobo, 20, alive at his home after she was reported missing.

Heartbroken: Holly's mom Karen Bobo is led into court by attorney Steve Farase in March, when Adams was charged with her murder and kidnap

Adams is accused of asking a fellow inmate to tell his brother: 'He's the one who started this s*** and if he don't shut his mouth he will be in the hole beside her,' CBS News reported.

Autry, 39, has been indicted with especially aggravated kidnapping and first-degree felony murder.

He is already in prison serving a three-year sentence for aggravated assault. 

The
 case about Miss Bobo's disappearance is still active. Prosecutors are 
considering seeking the death penalty if they get a conviction in the 
case.
