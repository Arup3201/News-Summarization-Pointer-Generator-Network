A Brazilian drugs trafficker was killed by his own stock when he was crushed by half a ton of marijuana.

The man died after he lost control of his car and hit a tree, resulting in his stock of weed stored in the backseat shooting forward, squashing him against the wheel.

The driver was on the run from the Federal Highway police, who had taken up the chase after the smuggler refused to stop at a road block in Bataguassu, 210 miles from Campo Grande.

The man was on his way from the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul to Sao Paulo with 500kg of marijuana when he was asked to stop by police.

In an attempt to escape, he embarked on a three-mile chase which ended against the tree where the man died instantly, Brazilian police said.

His car and its precious cargo were taking to the nearby Bataguassu police station where it was confiscated.

Authorities have been unable to identify the deceased because he was carrying no identification.

Marijuana trafficking carries a prison sentence of up to 15 years in Brazil

Possession of marijuana and other drugs is illegal in Brazil, but if the purpose of personal consumption can be proven, whether it is possession, planting or preparation of the drug, it only entails a warning, community service and education on the effects of drug use.=

Smuggling and selling larger quantities of drugs is classified as trafficking and a conviction leads to between five and 15 years behind bars.

As with a majority of drugs trafficking in Latin America, a majority of the trade is controlled by gangs, particularly in major cities.
