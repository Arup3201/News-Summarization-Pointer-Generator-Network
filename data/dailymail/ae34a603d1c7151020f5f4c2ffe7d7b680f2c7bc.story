A 25-year-old Ohio man has admitted to raping at least half a dozen women he met on online dating sites — and told detectives he was 'surprised' more victims hadn't come forward yet, cops say.

Police in Columbus say that Terry J. Smith Jr. was already on another date on Monday, just a day after he allegedly raped a 21-year-old woman he met on the dating website Plenty of Fish.

That second woman, 25, later told cops she also had been sexually assaulted.

Smith was booked on two counts of rape and kidnapping for both assaults. 

While he was questioned, Smith told cops that he'd been victimizing women for a while and there were other assaults 'more serious than this,' the Columbus Dispatch reported.

BUSTED: Terry S. Smith Jr., 25, was arrested in Columbus, Ohio, on two counts of sexual assault and kidnapping. He named at least six other female victims

BAIT: In his Plenty of Fish profile, Smith says he enjoys 'cuddling' and 'cooking for her' on the first date. But police say that he's sexually assaulted more than half a dozen women he met through the online dating website

'He said he was really surprised the other girls hadn’t come forward,' Sgt. Terry McConnell told the Dispatch.

Smith named six other victims to Columbus police, but admitted there were more, according to WBNS.

The women went to his house voluntarily and some had consensual sex with him, police said.

'But once they’d got to the house, he’d take it above what was agreed upon,' McConnell told the Dispatch.

He is being held on $1.5 million bond at the Franklin County jail.

One of the victims said Smith told her his actions were a 'fetish.'

The woman, who had consensual sex with him once before he forced himself on her, said he threatened to shoot himself if she didn't go to his house.

She called police, who went to the house but found nothing wrong.

Police records indicate he told another woman that he'd shoot himself about a month earlier.

One of Smith's victims, who he met using the pictured Plenty of Fish profile, said Smith forced himself on her even after they'd had consensual sex. He told her he had a 'fetish'

'He’s not aware of what he’s doing is wrong,'  the victim told the Dispatch. 'He just thinks it’s something he likes to do, like role playing or something.'

One of Smith's friends, Tony Dunn, told WBNS that Smith was open about scoring dates off sites like Plenty of Fish, OK Cupid and Craigslist.

'I knew he was sleeping with them — it all seemed consensual,' Dunn told the station. 'There was nothing out of the ordinary.'

But then on Sunday, Smith sent him a Facebook message claiming he 'grew a conscience.'

'I feel horrible about everything I've done,' he wrote, according to WBNS. 'I think I'm spent on being the punisher.'

In his online dating profile, Smith says he enjoy 'ghosthunting' and has a 'bit of old-fashioned country boy' in him. For a first date he says he'd 'cook her dinner and cuddle up watching some horror movies.'
