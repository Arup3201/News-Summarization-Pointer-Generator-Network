They won't be walking down the aisle after all.

Robin Wright, 48, and Ben Foster, 34, have ended their 10-month engagement, according to a Wednesday report from UsWeekly.

'She got swept up in the engagement last Christmas, but then their schedules got crazy and she realized it wasn't the right decision,' a source told the publication.

No wedding bells for these two: Robin Wright has ended her 10-month engagement to actor Ben Foster, who she is seen with here in January, according to a Wednesday report from UsWeekly

The couple's age difference - she is 14 years older - turned out to be a major issue.

The ex-wife of Sean Penn (who is now dating Charlize Theron) felt as if Ben was just 'too immature' a source added.

'The gap just ended up being too much,' an insider revealed. 'Ben was kind of immature. She couldn't deal with him anymore.'

Once in step: Robin and Sean, pictured at the NYC premiere of The Interpreter in 2005, were married from 1996 to 2010

And the couple - they met on set of their 2011 film Rampart - were also working in separate cities, which created an emotional distance.

Robin was shooting the Netflix show House of Cards in Baltimore while Ben was in London doing A Streetcar Named Desire on stage.

During her downtime, Wright liked to visit her children - Dylan, 23, and Hopper Jack, 21 (their father is Penn) - in Los Angeles.

Before Sean, who she wed in 1996 and divorced in 2010, Robin was married to Dane Witherspoon.

Meanwhile, Penn (who was once wed to Madonna) just returned from South Africa where he directed his 39-year-old love Theron in the love story The Last Face. Javier Bardem and Jean Reno also star.

In August model Dylan, who used to date Robert Pattinson, said of her father and the bombshell: 'They're a great couple. They're both very happy and, yeah, I love it.'

She added, 'They're both extremely strong personalities and they're very intelligent, so conversation lasts between them.'

In February Robin broke her silence on her divorce from Sean.

The Forrest Gump star told a British paper, 'Divorce in and of itself, and with children, is devastating. Worse than that.

'One of the reasons why we got back together and broke up so much was trying to keep the family together. If you've got kids, it's a family, and you try again, and you try again. We did that for a long time.'
