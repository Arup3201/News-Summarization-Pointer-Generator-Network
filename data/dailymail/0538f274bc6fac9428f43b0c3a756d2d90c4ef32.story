David Wyn Jones, 42, stabbed his two-year-old son and wife to death because he thought the boy was the devil

A mentally ill father stabbed his two-year-old son and wife to death because he thought the boy was the devil.

David Wyn Jones, 42, of Tremadog, Gwynedd, a former insurance salesman, was sent to a secure psychiatric unit by a judge at Caernarfon crown court.

He had admitted their manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

Sending him to Ty Llywelyn medium secure unit at Llanfairfechan, Judge Merfyn Hughes QC told Jones : 'For many years your wife cared for you both in good and more difficult times.

'It’s clear from the evidence before me she died in a desperate but ultimately unsuccessful attempt to save the life of her child.

'William was only two, an innocent and defenceless victim. What you did to both of them was dreadful and terrifying.

'It’s to be hoped at least William was too young to fully understand the threat he was under until it was too late.'

The judge added : 'You were so totally overcome by your delusional beliefs.'

Suzanne Jones, 34, had been strangled and stabbed to the chest on the night of March 30. William had six major stab wounds to the chest and neck. Their bodies lay close to each other.

Prosecuting counsel Simon Mills said : 'When police arrived the defendant admitted what he had done.

'He was saying he had been setting out to save the world.' Jones said he had become increasingly preoccupied by the bible.

Suzanne’s mother Eileen Holt said in a statement : 'I have lost my very best friend, my only child.'

She described William as a 'sweet, sweet, funny grandson.'

Mrs Holt said the last evening she saw them he was helping to prune trees. 'His loss is indescribable,' she added.

Elwen Evans QC, defending, said a hospital order was appropriate.

Detective Inspector Iestyn Davies of North Wales police said afterwards : 'No form of sentence will ever heal the pain that family and close friends have suffered since the killings.

They have shown enormous courage, strength and dignity throughout the investigation. They have maintained throughout that all they wish to see is for justice and fairness to prevail.'
