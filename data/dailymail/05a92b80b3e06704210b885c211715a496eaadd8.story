Turning a corner: Oprah Winfrey said that she realized the content on OWN was too serious

Oprah Winfrey has admitted that her TV network failed when it launched because she put programs on air that were too serious.

The chat show queen said that OWN needed more humor and that she was to blame for things being too 'stoic'.

She also told New York magazine that when things were at their worst she got through it by saying to herself: 'Maybe I won't feel this bad forever'.

Winfrey herself has admitted that OWN was not what she expected at its January 2011 debut and said in one interview that she might not have even bothered had she known how tough it would be.

She nearly had a nervous breakdown and
 worked cripplingly long days whilst at the same time wrapping up the 
25-year run of The Oprah Winfrey show.

But things are finally turning a corner: In July OWN finally became profitable and the ratings are improving.

For
 August it drew a channel-high 536,000 prime-time viewers but that is 
still a long way off rivals like Bravo which regularly gets 900,000 
viewers, or Lifetime which draws in one million.

Reflecting
 on those early mistakes, Winfrey told New York magazine: ‘I have a 
tendency to look at everything from the point of view of: What is going 
to be meaningful, and uplift people?

'That can become too stoic and too 
serious - which is the same issue I suffered with at the magazine 
(Oprah, her own magazine) in the beginning. It needed more humor. So we (began) looking for lighter fare.’

She added that the 'biggest mistake' was not involving TV network Discovery from an earlier stage.

Instead she decided to 'set out on our own' which she found impossible to do because she did not have enough hours in the day.

What's next? Winfrey said she is eying Broadway after her successful role in 'Lee Daniels' The Butler' with Forest Whitaker, pictured. Winfrey said that for her Broadway is a 'big wide-open door right now'

Winfrey also found it heartbreaking to fire 150 members of staff, and personally cancel Rosie O'Donnell's nightly talk show, The Rosie Show, because of poor viewing figures.

Winfrey said: 'I never imagined that, because I've done the opposite. I'm the person that's taken everybody on the world cruise with their families. I'm not the person who's laying people off.'

Winfrey has taken time to adjust to having a smaller budget but has found enough money to keep Tyler Perry on the channel, and he has been a huge hit.

Speaking to the magazine, she also revealed the bizarre moment she knew she had to leave the Oprah show and start the new project.

'I knew it was time to go when I sat in a pitch meeting for the Oprah show and somebody said, "Maybe we could take you and an audience to outer space",' she said.

After the move to the network and with things settling down, she told New York magazine that she might consider doing more acting - or even Broadway.

She said that after her well received role in The Butler she had been talking to Scott Sanders, the producer of the hit show The Colour Purple. She said Broadway is a 'big wide-open door right now'.

Regrets: She said it was heartbreaking firing 150 people from the struggling network, including Rosie O'Donnell (pictured with Russell Brand) whose show on the network was cancelled

Her confidence is the first sign that Winfrey is feeling positive since OWN launched.

After its blockbuster opening week which saw one million people tune in, ratings tumbled and sank to 300,000 in prime time and 150,000 in the day.

Among those who jumped ship was chief executive Christina Norman and another senior boss.

In an interview in August 2011 Oprah admitted OWN, which stands for the Oprah Winfrey Network, was ‘not where I want it to be’.

She also begged audiences to wait before making their minds up and asked for a grace period - of three whole years.

Since then a string of exclusives have followed including Lance Armstrong after he confessed to being a drug cheat, helping OWN to get back on its feet.
