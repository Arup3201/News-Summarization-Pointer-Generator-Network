A lorry driver had a miraculous escape when his 30-tonne HGV smashed into a bridge - leaving this devastating wreckage.

Incredibly, the driver escaped serious injury following the crash on the A64 near Malton, north Yorkshire, yesterday afternoon.

The vehicle, which was carrying grain, hit the Castle Howard flyover, causing extensive damage and closing the westbound carriageway.

The lorry belonging to East Yorkshire firm Warcup crashed into the supports for a flyover along the A64 at Malton

But although the lorry was very badly damaged and the air ambulance was called, its driver escaped life-threatening injury and was said to be sitting up in bed and talking.

Chief Inspector Ian Thompson said: 'The vehicles are very well made and are meant to take the impact and collapse to protect the driver.

'From what we first saw we were expecting it to be much more serious which is why the air ambulance was sent. It's a very happy ending.'

The driver was out of the vehicle by the time firefighters arrived and was able to talk to police at the scene.

The bridge was examined by structural experts who concluded it was not seriously damaged

The eastbound carriageway was temporarily closed to allow the air ambulance to land and to airlift the man to York Hospital, but quickly reopened.

The westbound carriageway remained closed well into the evening. The lorry driver was treated for a cut to his head and abdominal pains, a police spokesman said.

No other vehicles or people were involved in the crash.

An engineer was sent to check for any structural damage to the bridge, which was found to be safe, a police spokesman said.
