President Barack Obama has said South Sudan 'stands on the precipice' of civil war as conflict in the country enters its sixth day.

The US has sent 45 troops to the young state to protect its embassy in the capital of Juba, which has seen at least 500 people killed in violence so far.

In a statement the President said: 'In 2011, millions of South Sudanese voted to forge a new nation, founded on the promise of a more peaceful and prosperous future for all of South Sudan's people.

On Sunday President Salva Kiir said that troops loyal to his ousted Vice President Riek Machar opened fire on a government meeting in an attempted coup

'In recent years, against great odds, South Sudan has made great progress toward breaking the cycle of violence that characterized much of its history.

'Today, that future is at risk. South Sudan stands at the precipice. Recent fighting threatens to plunge South Sudan back into the dark days of its past.'

The State Department has issued a warning to US citizens in the country that they should leave immediately, and has evacuated all non-emergency government personnel.

Elsewhere South Sudan government officials have said that rebels are in control of the town of Bor, 125 miles north of the capital, and that the military is using heavy artillery.

The conflict began on Sunday when 
troops loyal to ousted Vice President Riek Machar allegedly opened fire 
at a government meeting in an attempt to force President Salva Kiir from
 power.

Machar was sacked 
along with the entire rest of the cabinet in July after announcing he 
was going to contest the 2015 general election.

Fears that fighting could spread into 
all-out civil war stem from the fact that Kiir is from the minority 
Dinka ethnic group, while Machar is a Nuer.

 20,000 South Sudanese are now sheltering in UN camps, with the Akobo 
base being attacked yesterday with the possible death of civilians.

Fighting has now spread to Bor, 125 miles north of Juba, the capital, and the military are using heavy artillery

Since the fighting started Kiir has imposed a night time curfew and has arrested ten former ministers

As well as drawing the attention of the US President, the conflict has also concerned neighbouring African states including Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda who have sent mediators to attempt to find a resolution.

In a statement on Thursday, Kiir said he was willing to talk to anyone who would listen, but that he was unsure what the possible outcome could be.

Since the fighting began Kiir has imposed an all night curfew and arrested ten former government ministers.

Machar is thought to be in hiding, and has previously dismissed the coup attempt as a disagreement between presidential guards.

South Sudan became an independent nation in 2011, and since then has struggled to establish a stable government with many active armed groups across the country.
