New role: Giggs will serve as Van Gaal's assistant after a spell as interim manager

'I
 would like to take this opportunity to announce my retirement from
 professional football and embark upon a new and exciting chapter in my 
life, as assistant manager of Manchester United,' Giggs, 40, said.

'I am immensely proud, honoured and fortunate to have represented the biggest club in the world 963 times and Wales 64 times.'

Giggs' honours included 13 Premier League titles and two Champions League successes.

He has served as a player-coach over the past year and took over as interim manager for the final four games of last season after the sacking of David Moyes.

United were thought to be keen to retain his services in a coaching capacity and his future is believed to have been a key part of negotiations with Van Gaal.

Giggs added: 'My
 dream was always to play for Manchester United, and although it saddens
 me to know I won’t be pulling on a United jersey again as a player, I 
have been lucky enough to have fulfilled that dream playing with some of
 the best players in the world, working under an incredible manager in 
Sir Alex Ferguson, and most of all, playing for the greatest fans in 
world football. I have always felt and appreciated your support.'

'I
 want to also give a huge thanks to the backroom staff and support teams
 we have and have had at Manchester United over the years. I would not 
have achieved the success I have without your continuing dedication and 
commitment to creating the best environment to enable the players to 
thrive. I would not have won 34 trophies in my career without you. I 
would also like to say a special thanks to my friends and family for all
 your love and support.

'For
 me, today is a new chapter filled with many emotions - immense pride, 
sadness, but most of all, excitement towards the future. United fans I 
hope will share and echo my belief that the club, the management and 
owners, are doing everything they can to return this great club to where
 it belongs, and I hope to be there every step of the way.

'To
 the greatest fans in world football, thank you, I have loved every 
minute of playing for you and representing the biggest and best club in 
the world. See you next season.'

Giggs,
 who met with Van Gaal in Holland last week, took temporary charge of 
United following Moyes' dismissal in April.

United beat Norwich 4-0 in his first 
match as manager before losing to Sunderland, recording a home win over 
Hull, and then drawing at Southampton on the final day of the season.

'I am 
thrilled to have the chance to serve as assistant manager,' Giggs said 
after his appointment was confirmed alongside Van Gaal's announcement on
 Monday.

'Louis van Gaal is a world-class coach and I know I will learn a lot 
about coaching from being able to observe and contribute at such close 
quarters.

'Manchester United has been a huge part of my life and I'm delighted 
to be able to continue that relationship in such a key role.'

Giggs, who came through United's youth ranks and was a member of their famous 'Class of '92' group of FA Youth Cup winners, was one of the finest players of his era.

United's executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward said: 'Ryan Giggs has been one of the greatest players ever to wear the red shirt of Manchester United. 'What he has achieved will never be equalled in the English game.

End of an era: Giggs is the Premier League's most decorated player

'In the way he played, he was the embodiment of a Manchester United player - fast, skilful, entertaining and determined to win by playing exciting football.

'His progress from the ranks of the famous 'Class of '92' to the most decorated player in this or any club's history is down to his hard work, ability and attitude.

'He is at the start of an exciting new chapter in his and the club's life but now is the right moment to reflect on the achievements of the finest British player of the last 25 years.'

Club owners Joel and Avie Glazer are convinced Van Gaal is right man to take them forward.Joel Glazer said: 'I am delighted that Louis will be our next manager.

'He
 has an outstanding pedigree as a coach, both as a man who motivates his
 teams to win trophies and as someone who believes in giving young 
players a chance to prove their worth.

'I am sure he will make a big impression on the club, the players and the fans.'

Avie
 Glazer said: 'Louis joins us at an exciting time and has already 
communicated some great ideas for how the club can move forward.

'The board is right behind him in his plans and everyone here is already looking forward to the start of next season.'
