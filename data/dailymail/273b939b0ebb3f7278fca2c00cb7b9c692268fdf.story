Woody Allen has taken part in his first ever podcast and revealed that he hates all his films, but does like some of the individual scenes.

The 35-minute interview, with MTV News’ Josh Horowitz, is remarkably candid, though he doesn't touch on the subject of his daughter Dylan Farrow’s sex abuse claims.

She claimed in an open letter to The New York Times in February that he sexually abused her when she was seven, an allegation that he has strenuously denied.

Candid: Woody Allen, pictured here in TV programme Imagine, has revealed that he's always disappointed with his films

Claims: Woody Allen's daughter, Dylan, alleges that she was sexually abused by her father when she was seven - a subject that the director avoids in the podcast

The Magic In The Moonlight director explained that his films never turned out as well as his imagination rendered them.

He said: ‘I am always disappointed - there is always a big difference in what one sets out to make and what one ends up with. What you set out to make is in your mind… in fantasy, it is what exists on paper.

‘“Emma [Stone] is going to do this line and it will be great", then when you do it Emma doesn't want to do those lines as they are hard to do - or the weather was not so great so we have to shift it to a different location because the sunlight is too harsh there. Or it takes her much longer to shuffle the deck of cards than you thought.’

He said that two of his favorite scenes come in Blue Jasmine, ‘where Cate Blanchett blew up and lost her cool’ and Match Point, ‘where Jonathan Rhys Meyers is flirting with Scarlett Johansson at the ping pong table’.

‘People don’t realize that she was only 19 years old when she made that film’, he added.

In the podcast he also addresses why in his movies, some of Hollywood’s greatest actors are conspicuous by their absence.

He said: ‘For years, most of the films I made starred me. Then I mostly I wrote for women, I worked with all the great women. The guys are great but they are always busy. I have called [Robert] De Niro, I've spoken on the phone to Dustin Hoffman and Jack Nicholson. Nicholson was going to do Hannah and Her Sisters - I wasn't thinking of Michael Caine at the time as I wasn't thinking of an English guy.

‘Now I am working with Joaquin Phoenix, who is a great actor, and Sean Penn. I just haven't had the opportunity to work with some of our greatest - Pacino, De Niro, Nicholson. I would love to work with him [Kevin Spacey] if I had anything for him I would do it in a minute.’

Allen revealed that film investors are kept completely in the dark about what they’re spending their dollars on.

He said: ‘If someone wants to back my films, they are told right away that you are not going to see a script, you are not going to be told anything about it, you put the money in the bank and that will be it. Only one in a few are very profitable. I don't think it is a good investment!’
