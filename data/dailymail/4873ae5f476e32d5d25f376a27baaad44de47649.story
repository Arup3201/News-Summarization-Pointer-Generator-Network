NBC Olympics sportscaster Bob Costas is set to return to work on Monday after being off the air for a week with pinkeye.

The veteran Olympics host started duty in Sochi with one eye reddened from an infection that he hoped would clear up quickly.

Instead, it spread to his other eye, blurring his vision and creating a social media firestorm.

NBC today said 'Today' host Matt Lauer will fill in one last time on NBC's Sunday night telecast before Costa returns to the hot seat.

Sore: Costas said he woke up to find his eye was swollen and joked that it was as red
 'as the Soviet flag'

Costas contracted the eye infection in Russia, before the start of the Olympics.

During Thursday's broadcast, he joked about red, 
watery and puffy left eye.

'Bear with me for a moment as I spare my 
friends in the press office countless inquiries,' he said.

'I have no choice to go 
all Peabody and Sherman on you for the next couple of nights since I 
woke up this morning with my left eye swollen shut and just about as red
 as the old Soviet flag.

'According to the NBC doctors here, it's some 
kind of minor infection which should resolve itself by the weekend. If 
only all my issues would resolve themselves that quickly, but that's 
another story.'

His assistant told Deadspin the infection made it impossible for Costas to wear contact lenses.

Following the primetime broadcast, the
 eye became a trending topic on Twitter, spawning numerous jokes and 
even a parody account.

Matt Lauer had filled in for Costas, he first time since 1988 Costas did not host NBC's primetime 
Olympics coverage, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

However, former Today host Meredith Vieira anchored NBC's Friday night coverage on her own,Â  becoming the first woman to do so.

Vieira, 60, who co-hosted the Opening Ceremony with Lauer and has been in Sochi doing segments for TODAY, said she was honored to be chosen as Costas' replacement.

'It's an honor to fill in for him,' Vieira told TODAY on Friday. 'You think about the Olympics, and you think the athletes and then Bob Costas.'
