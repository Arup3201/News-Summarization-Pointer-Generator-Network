Battling for life: Little Will Riggans, pictured, survived when his mother was killed in a car crash last week but his chances are grim

A newly married North Carolina man whose pregnant wife was killed in a devastating car crash has held his baby boy for the first time as doctors warn the infant's chance of survival is grim.

Megan Riggans, 22, was thrown through the windshield of the couple's SUV on September 2 as her husband Brian 'Casey' Riggans rushed her to hospital to give birth to their little boy.

Megan wasn't wearing a seat-belt, because she was having contractions during her labour, when the vehicle ran 20 feet off the road and slammed into a tree.

She was pronounced dead at Almance Regional Medical Center but doctors managed to save the couple's child, Will, who they delivered by C-section.

The baby, however, suffered serious head trauma in the collision and has been on life support since the crash.

Megan's uncle, Randy Lewis, spoke out about the family's devastation and explained that the little boy he calls the 'miracle kid' was losing his battle for life.

'The doctors said that with the extent of his injuries, it is uncertain if he can survive,' Lewis said, according to the Burlington Times News.

'During the accident, he was oxygen deprived and received blunt force trauma to his little head.'

Lewis added that it took doctors nine minutes to get Will's heart started - during which time his oxygen supply was cut off - and he doesn't have much brain activity.

'His father and the doctors are reviewing his condition and some hard decisions are still ahead,' he said.

Lewis said the family was keeping 
constant vigil at the hospital, adding that the uncertainty of Will’s 
condition was difficult on everyone.

'If he stays here, we get him,' Lewis said. 'If he can’t stay here, his mama and great-granddaddy get him.'

Casey Riggans, 22, suffered a broken skull
and fractured jaw in the crash, and was able to hold his little boy for
the first time on Sunday after he was moved out of the intensive care 
unit at UNC Hospitals in Chapel Hill.

Last Thursday, Casey had surgery, which wired his jaw shut.

'The operation was a success, however, he has a long road to a full recovery,' Lewis said.

Emotional, he said the first thing Casey said to him when he regained consciousness and was told the heart-breaking news was 'sorry'.

'I couldn’t quite understand why that was in his mind,' said Lewis, a dairy farmer who was like a second father to Megan.

'This
is a terrible thing that happened. I’m not mad at anybody. I don’t 
blame anybody. ...I just hate that it had to happen to her.'

In
a press conference, Lewis described how the couple, 
who were married only a few months ago, had spent the day with family 
before the fated trip to the hospital.

Both Casey and Megan's extended families arrived at the hospital before they did. No one knew they'd been in a crash until later.

According to Megan’s Facebook page, the North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University graduate was expected to give birth on September 27, which means that Riggans was nearly four weeks away from her due date at the time of the crash. 

Authorities said that the Riggans visited the UNC Chapel Hill Hospital the day before the crash, when the 22-year-old started having contractions, but she was sent home.

The accident took place just before 10pm on Greensboro-Chapel Hill Road, a rural area in southern Alamance County. A severe thunderstorm had dumped heavy rains on the highway, causing minor flooding and limiting visibility.
