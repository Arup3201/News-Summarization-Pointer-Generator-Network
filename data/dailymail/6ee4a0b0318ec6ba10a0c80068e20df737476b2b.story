Tragic: The bodies of Eoghan Chada, 10 (right) and his brother Ruairi, five, (left) were found in the boot of their father Sanjeev Chada's (centre) car after he crashed into a wall in County Mayo, Ireland, yesterday

Two brothers were found dead in the boot of their father’s crashed car yesterday after their mother reported them missing.

Nurse Kathleen Chada trained in London before moving to Ireland with her husband Sanjeev, 43.

Mr Chada, who was believed to have been under investigation for fraud, was meant to be taking sons Eoghan, ten, and Ruairi, five, to a bowling alley on Sunday evening.

But when he failed to return home, his wife Kathleen contacted police and raised the alarm.

Yesterday Mr Chada’s Ford Focus was found after it crashed into a stone wall near Westport, County Mayo – more than 170 miles from the family’s home in County Carlow.

The boys’ bodies were found in the boot of the vehicle and Mr Chada – who suffered non-life threatening injuries in the crash – was cut free from the car and taken to Mayo General Hospital.

Post-mortem examinations were due to be carried out yesterday, but police sources said the boys were thought to have been strangled or suffocated.

Mrs Chada qualified as a nurse in Kingston, south west London, where the couple are believed to have met. Police initially said they had no knowledge of any breakdown in the family and insisted the couple were not estranged.

However shortly after driving away with the boys, Mr Chada called a family member and left what was described as a ‘very distressed message’.

And a police source suggested Mr Chada, who ran a computer business from home, had been linked to the disappearance of £50,000 from his local community centre. 

They said: ‘Mr Chada was on a committee which had raised significant funds in relation to the building of an extension at the community centre, but enquiries at a local bank branch showed the cash had gone missing.

‘An investigation was under way into an alleged fraud but it had only just started.’

Father Declan Foley, a friend of the family, said the news of the boys’ deaths had hit Mrs Chada ‘like an earthquake’.

‘It was devastating for all of us,’ he
 said. ‘You cannot put into words the shock and the pain and the 
numbness and the grief of that news coming through that her two boys had
 died.’

The priest said the brothers were ‘lovely little lads’ and were Mrs Chada’s ‘pride and joy’.

And headmistress Michelle Doorley from
 Ballinkillen National School, where the boys were pupils, said the pair
 were ‘very close’.

Sanjeev Chada, 43, (right) was injured in the crash but police found the bodies of his two children Eoghan, ten (left) and Ruairi, five, (centre), in the car boot

‘Ruairi was like Eoghan’s shadow,’ she
 said. ‘They were very clever, bright, took part in everything. They 
were very popular chaps, great sense of fun, great sense of humour.

‘They were just two super boys. Lovely
 characters. They had the whole package. They were lovely to deal with, 
lovely manners. They’ll be missed by everybody.’

Last night a friend of Mrs Chada said:
 ‘This is the end of her life. This is the worst thing that could happen
 to her. It’s going to take a long time for her to come to terms with 
this, she’s just lost her family.’
