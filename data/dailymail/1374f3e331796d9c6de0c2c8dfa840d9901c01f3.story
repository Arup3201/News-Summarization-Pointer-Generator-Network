Sergio Aguero does not have to be on the scoresheet to have a match-winning influence.

Granted, there are not many games these days in which the Argentine fails to find the net, as an impressive tally of 17 goals already this season proves.

But on those rare occasions when Aguero doesn't score, you appreciate his all-round contribution to Manchester City's cause even more.

Sunday's emphatic 3-0 victory at Southampton was a case in point. Aguero led the line magnificently, turning in one of his best performances of the season. He didn't score but still defined the outcome of the game, like Luis Suarez used to for Liverpool.

Plotting his 42 touches of the ball on a map of the pitch, as Match of the Day 2 did in their analysis on Sunday night, showed how Aguero caused problems for the whole Southampton back line.

He was here, there and everywhere. Left side, right side, through the middle. The striker spent the afternoon as a busybody, twisting and turning past challenges, drifting into space, orchestrating the attack, carving out chances.

He set-up City's first goal for Yaya Toure and their third for Gael Clichy. He also should have won a penalty when brought down by Jose Fonte, only to be shown a yellow card for simulation in a senseless decision by referee Mike Jones.

Had Aguero not missed a straightforward chance at the far post in the 64th minute it would have been the perfect performance to mark his 100th Premier League game.

No matter. His all-round contribution underlined - as if we needed further proof - that his priceless importance goes far beyond goals.

Aguero's work-rate couldn't be faulted - he ran 9.7km during the match and recovered possession on three occasions through his relentless pursuit of Southampton's defenders.

His sensational hat-trick against Bayern Munich last week looks like a turning point in City's season. Prior to that match, they had won just twice in seven matches in all competitions.

Suddenly, they look a more unified and effective force. City may have given Chelsea a head-start in the Premier League title race but they're not about to give up the chase.

Aguero will have the same influence on City's title challenge as Luis Suarez did for Liverpool last season

Aguero will have the singular impact on City's challenge for silverware this season as Suarez had for Liverpool last.

Suarez scored 31 Premier League goals as Liverpool finished a fraction short of the title. But his all-round contribution in setting up goals for others and his general commitment and work ethic were also exceptional.

Aguero is exactly the same - a talismanic figure who will also top 30 goals - it's just he does all this without bringing any embarrassment on his club. Suarez will always be tainted by his biting and racism controversies however many goals he scores.

He's Suarez minus the madness and his all-round contribution needs to be appreciated.
