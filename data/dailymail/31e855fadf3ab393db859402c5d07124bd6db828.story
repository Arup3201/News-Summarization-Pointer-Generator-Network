The entry for Indigenous Australian on Wikipedia was one of the most viewed pages during 2014 gaining 4.7million hits on May 24 alone 

Popular pages on Wikipedia during 2014 have been revealed with one of the most read entries being 'Indigenous Australian'. 

For eight days running starting on May 18, the entry was the most viewed page reaching a peak of 4.7million hits on May 24.

But despite being one of the most read pages on the encyclopedia site last year, it is unclear why so many people worldwide were searching for the term.

The list of last year's most viewed Wikipedia pages has been compiled by website Quartz, who analysed the top viewed page every day of last year.

During the study, they found that most of the top results followed big news events, with the profile of actor Robin Williams being viewed more than 5.1million times on August 12, the day after his death.

The profile for fellow actor Philip Seymour Hoffman was also the top viewed page with 1.7million hits on February 2, the day of his death.

During early March, the entry for Crimea was the most-well read, which coincided with the region's annexation by Russia.

Meanwhile during most of June, while the FIFA World Cup was taking place in Brazil, its entry on Wikipedia was the most viewed on almost half of the days in the month.

But for other pages, such as 'Indigenous Australian', researchers are unable to say why they were so popular, although one explanation is that during this time Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbot announced cuts to programmes that help his country's aboriginal population.

Another possible explanation is it came in the lead up to National Sorry Day, which is in honour of the Stolen Generations in Australia. 

Other pages which also received high page views for no apparent explanation is the entry for the dinosaur species triceratops, which received 1.1million hits on March 28.

There were also two consecutive days of more than a million views of the Malware page and the entry explaining the meaning of alliteration was the most viewed entry for seven consecutive days.

However, the site explained: 'Because the data measure page views and not unique visitors, they are subject to distortion from bots, or software that requests pages programatically.

'A software developer could accidentally write a bot that views a page tens of thousands of times instead of once. This helps explain the very large numbers of views for random pages like Malware.'

The results almost mirror the most searched for terms on Google last year, which also saw the World Cup being one of the most popular searches.

During June, the entry for FIFA World Cup was the most read page on Wikipedia while the tournament was underway in Brazil 

Globally, searches for the Robin Williams proved popular as did the terms Apple's iPhone 6, and the Ebola crisis.

The results were based on the most popular search terms within various categories over the past 12 months.

The top female celebrity worldwide was Jennifer Lawrence, followed by Kim Kardashian.
