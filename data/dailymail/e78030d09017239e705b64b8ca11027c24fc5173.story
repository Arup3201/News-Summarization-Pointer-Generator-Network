A Turkish Cup match and a game in the English FA Trophy may not sound like memorable soccer occasions, but one punter will never forget them after he miraculously picked the right results in each encounter to become a millionaire.

Online bookmaker sportsbet.com.au was taken to the cleaners in two seemingly insignificant soccer matches played in of all places an English village and Turkey. The small $30 bet was on the correct half-time and full-time scores in each game.

The odds of the bet winning was 35,471 to 1. Suddenly $30 was turned into $1,064,284.

Giresunspor playing Genclerbirlgi in the Turkish Cup turned out to be a game to savour for one lucky punter

A $30 online bet was turned into $1,064,284 of winnings thanks to two European soccer matches

It’s unlikely many soccer fans will have a clue about the teams involved though. The first leg of the bet had Giresunspor playing Genclerbirlgi in the Turkish Cup – half-time score Giresunspor 2-0; full time score 2-2.

The second leg of the bet was in the English FA Trophy where Welling United faced Ebbsfleet. Here the half-time score was Welling Utd 2-0, and the full-time score was 2-2.

The mystery punter also had the teams Welling United and Ebbsfleet to thank for his big payday

By getting the half-time and full-time scores right in each match the mystery punter became an instant millionare. Online bookmaker sportsbet.com.au took a hit and can't have been feeling too happy at the outcome but, on the face of it at least, they were still able to show some Christmas cheer.

‘This bet will surely go down in history as one of the all-time greatest,' said sportsbet.com.au’s Christian Jantzen. 

'It’s going to be one very merry Christmas for this particular Sportsbet customer and even though it’s cost us a small fortune, we’re genuinely excited for them.’

Online bookmaker sportsbet.com.au remained gracious about the outcome despite taking a major hit
