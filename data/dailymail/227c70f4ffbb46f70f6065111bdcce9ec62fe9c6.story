Joe Hart admits he has a fight on his hands to keep Manchester City's No 1 jersey this season – but is confident he'll win his duel with summer signing Willy Caballero.

The England goalkeeper was restored to the side for Sunday's 2-0 victory at Newcastle after Caballero had debuted in the Community Shield seven days earlier.

The suspicion is the Argentine would have kept his place had City not lost 3-0 to Arsenal. But manager Manuel Pellegrini – who worked with Caballero at Malaga – started the Premier League season with Hart and he will continue between the posts when the champions host Liverpool on Monday.

Hart, though, was dropped by Pellegrini in favour of Costel Pantilimon after a string of gaffes last season. And the 27-year-old accepts he faces a new challenge following the £6million arrival of Caballero.

'That's who we are as a club. No-one can afford to rest, no-one is undroppable and no-one is guaranteed to play every game,' said Hart, who is currently in talks over a new contract at the Etihad.

'We all have to perform and that includes me. It suits me. I'm a fighter, I've been a fighter all my life. I'll continue to do that. I am ready to fight and I'm looking forward to hopefully keeping this position for a long time.'

Hart missed seven league matches when he was axed last November and expects to sit out a few more this time around, if only because of Pellegrini's rotation policy as City compete on four fronts.

'Times have changed. Look around, everyone has (two) quality keepers,' he said. 'Sometimes stuff happens and goalkeeper is an important position, so you need two good keepers.

'Caballero is a great signing. We were sorry to lose Pantilimon to Sunderland and we wish him well.

'But Willy has come in - we know he's a great keeper after what he's done at Malaga. He wants to play as much as I do, but I've got the place at the moment and I'm going to do everything I can to keep it.'

For the time being, however, Hart is enjoying the view. City barely broke sweat at St James' Park as goals from David Silva and Sergio Aguero got their title defence off to a winning start.

And Hart added: 'I've always enjoyed watching this team. It's a great team to play for and they're a great bunch to train with.

'For most of them it comes off more than not, so you can't really say they are flair players - they're just quality players.

'We feel really settled as a team. We've had a good year under this manager and we feel ready to kick on. This club wants to do well and nobody wants to do better than this group of players.'
