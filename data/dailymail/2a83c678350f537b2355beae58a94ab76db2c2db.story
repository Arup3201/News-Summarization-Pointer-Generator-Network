An unclaimed Powerball ticket worth $16 million became worthless today after a six-month deadline for the winner to claim the prize money expired.

'It's only happened a few other times, so this is really, really unusual,' said Florida Lottery spokeswoman Amy Bisceglia - the state where the ticket was bought.

'It could have been anything, from somebody forgetting about it in the laundry, or just throwing it away. We have no idea what happened,' Bisceglia said, when asked how the ticket holder could not have claimed the fortune.

The ticket became worthless when a 180-day deadline to claim the jackpot expired at 11:59 p.m. EST on Thursday, Bisceglia said.

It was the largest unclaimed jackpot in Florida since 2003, when a $53.7 million jackpot expired.

The winning numbers were 2, 6, 19, 21, 27 and a Powerball number of 25.

The winning ticket was purchased in May at the Carollwood Market, a convenience store in Tampa

The owner of the Carrollwood Market said Monday that she wonders about the winner every day she walks into her store.

'The store is a neighborhood store, and pretty much 90 percent of our customers are regular customers,' she said.

Nidia Tannous had placed signs in her store's window, urging customers to check their Powerball tickets from Memorial Day.

The store received $25,000 for selling the winning ticket.

'I bought a ticket that very day that ticket was sold here,' said Joe Fitzgerald, a nearby resident. 'I checked mine, and unfortunately, it wasn't mine.'

According to the Florida Lottery website, if a Powerball jackpot isn't claimed within 180 days from the draw date, 'the funds to pay the unclaimed jackpot will be returned to the lottery members in their proportion of sales for the jackpot rollover series.'

In Florida, about 80 percent of that share will go toward the state's education enhancement trust fund.

The remaining 20 percent goes to the Florida Lottery prize pool to fund new games and promotions.
