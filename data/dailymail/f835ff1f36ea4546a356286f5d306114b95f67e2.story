'If you don’t want to settle for anything less than perfect then the Secret Diamond Club is for you’, a sultry voiceover informs prospective customers in a video advertising a new controversial dating website.

The Secret Diamond Club, which started in Demark and has spread across Europe and America has just launched here in the UK to a rather mixed response.

While the club insists it is receiving growing levels of interest in Britain, opponents have branded the club – which pairs rich men with women rated purely on their looks- as an example of chauvinistic objectification.

Women who join up have to meet the strict looks criteria of a panel of twenty 'experts' and submit 3 photographs- including a full body shot- from which they are given a rating out of 100

Started in 2010 in Denmark, the site was started by serial entrepreneur Gus Terkelsen, 33, whose aim was to introduce a new high-end dating concept. He believes the world’s richest men often don’t have the time to search for love, but nor do they want to lose control of the dating process and be match-made.

And Gus has a rather controversial reason for his decision to launch in the UK, claiming rich British men can't find love as the women here are unattractive. He told MailOnline: 'Coming from a Scandinavian country we know Britain as a country of ugly women.

‘There are a lot of a wealthy men here but the women are not very attractive and it is difficult for the men to meet good looking women.

Men are not submitted to any questions when they attempt to join the site, only to provide an email address and informed about pricing

‘We already have over 30 millionaires members from Denmark and across Europe and we’re now signing up the UK’s most eligible and wealthy men.

‘These types of men may not have a lot of time on their hands, but they don’t want a control freak matchmaker telling them who and where to date. They want to feel free to make the perfect choice themselves.’

Costing up to $100,000 (£60,000) a year for men to join, the site already boasts a raft of millionaire businessmen, from ‘European tennis players to self-made millionaire internet entrepreneurs.’

Women can join the site for considerably less, however they do have to meet the strict looks criteria of a panel of twenty ‘experts’ and submit three photographs- including a full body shot.

Male members can sort women how they wish, as well as filtering women so they only ever see women above a certain rating

Women pay up to £30 a year for one year’s membership to the site, depending on the rating they are given by the panel form 1-100 (100 being the best), which is calculated based on their photographs, but  adjusted according to their age and the other women at the club they join.

Male members are able to buy memberships for multiple clubs, choosing from a single club ($10,000 or about £6,000 a year), a ‘region’ such as North America or Europe which gives access to all the clubs in that area ($50,000 or about £30,000 ) or global membership, which at a $100,000 (£60,000), gives a man free reign to look at and contact all the women signed up to any club in the world.

Men can pay for various levels of membership, giving them access to the women in one to all of the clubs across the world

Women however can only sign up for one club. For example women living in France would sign up for the Secret Diamond Club France, and their rating is calculated in comparison to others signed up to that club. So in a club full of stunning women, your rating is likely to be lower.

Women's rating also affects how much they pay for membership; the lower your rating, the more you pay.

Any non-physical factors such as interests or level of education are not taken into account, and men can filter the women they view based on rating, with many opting not be visible to, or view themselves, any women who scored less than 90.

Gus Terkelsen, 33, says that appearance is ultimately the most important thing to men

Gus says he was inspired to start the business because he saw a gap in the online dating market.

‘I noticed on another dating website that the men weren’t necessarily physically attractive and that those men who were standing in a suit were rated higher.

‘I concluded that women weren’t interested in looks and were instead interested in other factors- namely financial success.

‘Although other sites for millionaire men exist, they only charged £10 a month for membership so what I found is most of the men on there were not in fact rich and were often dubious or weirdos. I figured if a man really has a lot of money, he will be willing to pay.’

Unsurprisingly, this view of the world, where men are purely driven in their romantic endeavours by ascetic factors, and women’s affections motivated by money, has been challenged by many.

‘The site just mirrors society. It is a truth that men like good looking women, it is very very important to them,’ Gus says.

‘Ugly girls don’t like the site and poor guys don’t like it. They don’t want to admit that guys prefer beautiful women and women want rich successful men.

‘The ugly girls create this moral concept around the idea; attempt to moralise the website. But if you speak to any evolutionary psychologist they will tell you this is the way we evolved as a species.

Gus admits a woman’s personality does come into play in romantic pairings, but only once a certain level of beauty had been satisfied.

‘It (appearance) is a very very important thing for men. Period.

‘It is a lower boundary, and then on top of this you need personality and compatibility. But looks are the first sorting mechanism, especially in internet dating.’

When asked if a man would ever date an ugly girl based on her good personality, Gus’s answer was resolute: ‘No. No I don’t think so.’
