These pictures capture the hilarious moment a cheeky bee decides to pick a fight with a grumpy grizzly bear.

The massive Kodiak found the pesky bee too much to bear as it buzzes around his head just out of reach.

This incredible comedic moment was captured by an amateur photographer who was visiting the bear den at Buffalo Zoo.

Buzz off: The Toby the Kodiak bear snarls irritably at the bee which is zipping around his nose, just out of striking distance

Terry Cervi from Buffalo, New York, saw this incredible sight on one of her regular visits to her local zoo.

Mrs Cervi's husband bought the 67-year-old a camera in 1999 and she has been taking stunning photos ever since.

She said: 'I found the zoo's handsome Kodiak bear named Toby sitting there 
surrounded by a number of those pesky little summer bees that annoy 
everyone at picnics.

You're getting right up my nose: The bear sneezes after the the insect persistently hovers in front of its face

'He 
wasn't taking his eyes off those little critters for one second, I 
thought for sure one of them was going to either fly in his mouth or up 
his nose.

'I felt bad for him but at the same time he was making such cute, comical gestures that he made me smile.

'I
couldn't wait to get home to see what I had captured when I was done, 
which to me is half the fun of photography, that pesky bee made my day.'

Not happy: Toby, a resident of Buffalo zoo, looked down in the dumps after being disturbed by the flying critter
