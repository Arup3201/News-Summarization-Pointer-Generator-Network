Steep: Dale Lidster said his late-night snack ended up being the 'most expensive bag of chips in the country'

A man who playfully threw a bag of chips at a friend in the street after a night out has been landed with a £565 fine for littering.

Car valeter Dale Lidster, 23, was arrested after being captured on CCTV hurling a balled up chip paper at his pal at the end of a night out last September.

He denied the offence but was found guilty of littering at Skegness Magistrates' Court.

The 23-year-old was fined £300 and ordered to pay £250 in costs and a £15 victim surcharge.

Speaking after the case Lidster, from Horncastle in Lincolnshire, claimed the fine was 'ridiculous' and insisted the chip wrapper had been picked up straight away.

'I can't believe what has happened,' he said.

'Almost £600, it must be the most expensive bag of chips in the country.'

The 23-year-old said he was struggling to see the funny side of his cheap late-night snack eventually costing him hundreds of pounds.

'It's not funny, not when you have to find £600 and when you haven't done anything wrong in the first place,' he said.

Lidster said he intended to appeal against the decision.

'I'd never condone littering but even if I had dropped the chip wrapper and left it, the fine is ridiculous - and very excessive,' he said.

'The annoying thing is you can go into the town centre any night of the week and there's always litter around.

'If that's shown on CCTV, why have they only taken me to court?

'Okay, I did throw the wrapper but it was picked up straight away.'

Litterer: Dale Lidster, who was fined almost £600 for littering, said the penalty was 'ridiculous' and 'excessive'

East Lindsey District Council said the court case highlighted the authority's attempts to clean up local streets.

'Littering will not be tolerated in East Lindsey because we know how important clean streets are to people,' a spokesman said.

'We use state of the art CCTV, information from the community and our officers to catch those littering.

'This means anyone could be watching and reporting litterers.'
