They brought you the iPad, the iPod and the iPhone - to name but a few.

Now prepare yourself for Apple's next big thing - the iWatch.

According to reports in China, where Apple manufactures most of its products, the latest 'smartwatch' is set to go on sale next summer.

iWatch: Wristbands with space to clip on the last generation of iPod Nano are already available on the market, but rumour has it an actual iWatch is on the way

The watch will reportedly have a one-and-a-half inch LED screen and allow users to send and receive email, texts and Facebook alerts as well as communicating with other devices wirelessly though Bluetooth.

Apple is also working on adding a tiny speaker and microphone to the iWatch to enhance its capabilities.

It is not, however, the first time that the so-called smartwatches have been developed.

Microsoft famously ended its development in 2008.

Sony more recently released a smartwatch design to accompany mobile phones which was met with mixed reviews.

A similar gadget called the Pebble has also been unveiled.

The Pebble E-Paper Watch features a 1.26-inch, 144 Ã— 168 pixel monochrome e-paper display with backlight.

The Pebble comes with apps pre-installed, including a cycling app to measure speed, distance and pace through GPS, and a golf range-finder app that supports more than 25,000 courses.

More apps will be downloadable from the phone.

One reviewer noted: 'Pebble is a hands-free solution to determine why your pocket is vibrating, without having to dig out your phone.'
