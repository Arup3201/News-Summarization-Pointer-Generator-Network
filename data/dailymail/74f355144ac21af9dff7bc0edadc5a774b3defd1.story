A cliff-edge hotel could collapse into the sea as coastal erosion has been wearing away the land at a rate of a metre a month.

The Blue Anchor Hotel, parts of which date back to the 15th century, has been forced to close its children’s garden play area that backs on to the cliffs, which are crumbling at a dangerous rate.

Recent flooding, rough seas and heavy rain have accelerated the issue, with locals fearing if nothing is done to stop the erosion, the hotel and pub, in the tourist town of Blue Anchor, West Somerset, could be lost into the sea.

At risk: The Blue Anchor Hotel in Minehead could be lost to coastal erosion

Wearing away: The pub backs on to cliffs which are crumbling due to sea erosion

Simon Strom, landlord of the Blue Anchor Hotel, said: ‘Over the last two or three months we've lost three or four metres. It's quite scary.

‘If they don't shore it up we've just got to sit here until the hotel falls in.’

Plans costing £570,000 to improve sea defences submitted to the Environment Agency by Somerset County Council have been turned down.

Mr Strom, who has run the hotel in Blue Anchor for 15 years, said coastal erosion has taken its toll on the land for the past seven years – with three metres lost in just two weeks in 2012.

Danger: The hotel was forced to close its children's play area which backs onto the cliffs

He said: ‘We are 100 per cent sure the land will come down – it’s just a case of when. There is no way it can be salvaged now.

‘We are concerned about public safety and would advise people not to go anywhere near it.’

Mr Strom, who lives at the property with his wife and three children, added: ‘There is no funding to sort it out, so I am in limbo. You don’t know what the sea or weather is going to do.’

Warning: The hotel has reduced the size of its beer garden due to the erosion

Chris Hall, West Somerset council spokesman, said: ‘If we were to do nothing, the hotel is at risk. The timeline is difficult, but I'd say around five years.

‘Eventually, if nothing were to happen, according to the erosion work we’ve had done, there would be the loss of the hotel. The foundations would be destablised.

‘The coastline is a moving feast.’

The council is due to discuss the Environment Agency proposals at a cabinet meeting on April 2, to decide whether to resubmit the plans.
