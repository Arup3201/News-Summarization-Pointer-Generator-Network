Pepe Reina looks set to return to Anfield after Italian side Napoli refused to meet Liverpool's valuation for the goalkeeper.

The Spain international spent last season on loan at the Serie A club under former Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez, but the player's agent has confirmed it will be 'difficult' for Reina to remain in Italy.

Although Napoli are interested in making the move permanent after the 31-year-old helped them to a third place finish in the league and claim the Copa Italia, they have been unable to agree a fee with the Premier League club.

Heading back? Pepe Reina could return to Liverpool after Napoli refused to meet the Reds' valuation

'It's very difficult for Pepe to remain at Napoli,' Reina's agent, Manuel Garcia Quilon told ESPN.

'From
 June 30, he will return to Liverpool because they want to maximise his 
sale, and Napoli are not willing to spend what is required.'

Despite making 394 appearances for 
Liverpool following his move from Villarreal in 2005, Reina has become 
surplus to requirements under manager Brendan Rodgers.

Simon
 Mignolet has established himself as the club's No 1, while Rodgers has 
also expressed an interest in being reunited with Swansea keeper Michel 
Vorm to provide competition for places.

Reina is currently with the Spain squad in Brazil where the reigning World Cup champions will be trying to win a fourth consecutive major tournament.

'Right now I'm only thinking of La Roja (Spain's national team),' Reina told Spanish radio station Cadena Ser recently.

'With regards to a new club, I will first have to speak to Liverpool.

'My season on loan at Napoli has been very positive and I thank the Napoli people and the club.'
