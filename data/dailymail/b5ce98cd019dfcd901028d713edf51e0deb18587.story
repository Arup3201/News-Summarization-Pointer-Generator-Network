For a second, it looked like Jermaine Kearse would lead the Seattle Seahawks to a spectacular victory with one of the craziest catches in Super Bowl history.

But while the 24-year-old  wide receiver used every part of his body to make the unbelievable bobbling catch late in the fourth quarter of the game - it wasn't enough to see off the New England Patriots. 

In the final minutes of the game, quarterback Russell Wilson was moving the Seahawks down the field in a bid to erase a four-point deficit.

Wide receiver Jermaine Kearse made one of the craziest catches in Super Bowl history but it wasn't enough to secure victory for the Seattle Seahawks

Late in the fourth quarter, Kearse used every part of his body to make the unbelievable bobbling catch which was tipped by New England Patriots cornerback Malcolm Butler 

Wilson entered the two-minute warning in New England territory and threw a deep pass to Kearse down the right sideline.

It was well defended by Patriots cornerback Malcolm Butler, who tipped the ball. 

But Kearse refused to let the ball touch the ground - and an incredible circus catch saw him juggle the ball four times before bringing it under his control, bringing the Seahawks to the one-yard line.  

Sadly, any hope of victory was soon dashed when Wilson threw an interception a couple of plays later to end the game 28-24.

Kearse wrote on Twitter: 'Tough loss today but so grateful for the opportunity and so appreciative of my teammates.' 

He added: 'This team is special and blessed to be a part of it.' 

The New England Patriots sealed their win when rookie Malcolm Butler intercepted a pass from Wilson at the New England end zone in the final seconds of the game.

The 24-year-old took to Twitter to express his disappointment, but added he is 'grateful' to be part of the team
