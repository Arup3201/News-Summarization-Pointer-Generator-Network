Angry: Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick, pictured, has launched a $56 million lawsuit after his plans to build a basketball and barn on his sprawling property in the Hamptons were rejected

Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick has launched a $56 million lawsuit after his plans to build a basketball court and barn on his sprawling property in the Hamptons were rejected.

The billionaire is furious after the zoning, planning, and farming advisory boards refused to allow the development on the 40-acre Bridgehampton property he bought in 2003 for $15 million.

To display the extent of his wrath for the Southampton Town municipal boards, he's launched two separate federal lawsuits against not only the boards but their individual members, according to The New York Post.

'He's basically saying this is war - he's had enough,' one of the sued parties told The Post. 'When you own a property like that you don't like to be told what you can or can't do on it.'

The source described the unusual act of going after board members as 'intimidation. Plain and simple.'

It's not unusal for the boards to be sued as a whole when rich Hampton homeowners don't get their way when it comes to zoning.

The finance boss filed a $36 million suit against the zoning board last week in Eastern District federal court for the basketball rejection specifically.

He claims in the suit that his purchase of the land gives him the land rights to a single-family home and 'recreational' uses.

But the zoning board said no.

'It is our position that a basketball 
court is not a compatible recreational use of an agriculturally 
protected area,' Devitt Spellman Barrett attorney David Arntsen told The
 Post.

The multimillion dollar suit came on the back of a $20 million one Lutnick filed against the Southampton Town planning board and farming advisory board earlier this year, taking aim at the rejection of a sizable barn.

The boards claimed a proposed 11,200 square-foot barn was too big and would only be approved if it was reduced to just 2,400 square-foot.

According to the New York Daily News, Lutnick did downsize the structure and offered to move it to a different location on the estate.

Lutnick's lawyer David Neufeld told the Daily News the officials were being 'unbelievable.'

'If you're offended by a basketball court 40 acres away, there aren't many places on Suffolk County that you could live,' Neufeld said.

'It's pretty unbelievable what they (Southampton officials) can do.'

The mansion on the property includes a swimming pool, spa and tennis court. The banking boss also wanted to build a 3-acre apple orchard, and a vineyard.
