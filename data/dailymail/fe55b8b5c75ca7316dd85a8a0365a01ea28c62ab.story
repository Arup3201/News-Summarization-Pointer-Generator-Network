Forget walking, learning how to crawl can prove equally difficult as this adorable new video shows.

Don Swift from Atlanta filmed his six-month-old daughter Harper attempting to move on all fours for the first time.

As the smiley tot continually falls flat on her belly and shuffles along the carpet, her trusty companion, Savannah the dog, watches on.

Finally, when Harper reaches the black Labrador, she gets a reward for her difficult traverse - an affectionate kiss on the nose.

To date the YouTube video of Harper and Savannah's bonding has been watched more than 450,000 times.

Many viewers have praised the dog's gentle temperament.

'I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship,' one fan said.

Harper's parents said the incident 'melted' their hearts.

'Labradors are the best family dog ever!' Mr Swift added.
