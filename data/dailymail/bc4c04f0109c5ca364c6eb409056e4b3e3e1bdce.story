Ashley Cole may not have been selected for Roy Hodgson's England squad but the former Chelsea left-back doesn't seem too bothered.

Living it up in Beverly Hills is hardly a bad consolation as the 33-year-old puts his World Cup snub behind him.

Cole, a free agent after seeing out his contract at Stamford Bridge, met pals at a restaurant while his ex-England team-mates train ahead of their friendly clash with Ecuador in Miami.

Cole is looking for a new club after
