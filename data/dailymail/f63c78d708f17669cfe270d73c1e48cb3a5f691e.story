Teenager Carl Griffiths may have the biggest feet in Britain, but he's taking it in his stride.

The 19-year-old, who stands at 6ft 8in, has feet that are a staggering 14.5in long - or a size 21. The UK average men's shoe size is a nine.

Unsurprisingly, he  regularly has to put up with people accidentally standing on them and struggles to find shoes that fit so has to order them from overseas.

In a league of his own: Carl Griffiths, 19, has Britain's biggest feet and wears a size 21 shoe

Mr Griffiths, from Trimsaram in south Wales said: 'My feet have always been huge - ever since I can remember.

'They
grew so fast when I was at school my mum kept having to buy me new 
shoes every few months. Each year I would go through two or three pairs.
I just wore them out really quickly.

'At primary school my feet were always two sizes bigger than anyone else’s.

'By the time I was 12 years old they were size 14. Then in the space of two years they had gone up to size 17.

'I play rugby and had a huge struggle finding rugby boots - I had to get them special ordered from America.'

Big measure: The teenager from Trimsaram in south Wales has to order his shoes from 
the U.S. because nobody in Britain makes footwear that large

Mr Griffiths stands at 6ft8in tall, 
just two inches shorter than beanpole England footballer Peter Crouch. 
But his feet are nine sizes bigger than striker Crouch's size 12s.

This means that the unemployed welder's footwear options are limited - and expensive.

He said: 'They don’t make size 21 
shoes anywhere in the UK. They cost about £50 to have made but because 
the boxes they come in are quite big it costs another £50 to have them 
mailed back here.

'I’ve got one pair of Nike trainers 
and a pair of steel-toe cap boots for work. I had some rugby boots made 
as well but they are already too small.

'I have to wear my trainers for everything so they end up looking grubby really quickly. I wish I could have a tidy pair.'

One man and his shoe: Mr Griffiths reveals the true extent of how large his footwear is

As he can only wear his trainers on 
nights out, Mr Griffiths is often turned away from clubs because his 
footwear doesn’t meet the dress code.

He said: 'It’s happened a few times 
that some places won’t let me in because I’m not wearing shoes, but 
usually the boys will come to another club with me.'

And the teenager reveals that women regularly chat him up on the dance floor with the line, 'Is it true what they say about men with big feet?'

Mr Griffiths' father Wayne, 39, a 
size 13, said: 'I don't know where Carl got his big feet from - he 
definitely didn't get them from me.'
