Wensleydale the giant dancing cat is looking for a new home after his owner passed away in December

He is the size of a three-year-old child and has a penchant for dancing.

Giant moggy Wensleydale is hoping his moves might catch the eye of a new owner, after he was taken in by an animal shelter when his owner died.

He is thought to be one of Britain's biggest cats, measuring 3ft 3ins from nose to tail - the same size as a three-year-old child, and weighing in at 7.2kg.

But despite his size, Wensleydale is incredibly light on his feet, and loves to dance and jig on his back paws when someone comes into the room.

Staff at the Willows Cat Adoption Centre in South Shields, Tyne and Wear, said the tabby and white cat, who is thought to be about six years old and is too big for a cat flap, regularly jumps about 'like a monkey', entertaining the team.

They have launched a campaign to find him a new home, after he was left homeless when his owner passed away in December.

Shelter owner Maria Harrison said they are now looking for someone to adopt the larger than life dancing cat.

She said: 'Wensleydale is the biggest and heaviest cat we have ever had - he’s absolutely enormous. He’s the size of of a small dog, and has a very quirky personality.

'He just has an enormous build. It’s nothing to with obesity - I have had many large cats but he is not obese.

'Every time he sees you, he will 
stand up and walk around on his back legs and do a little dance or jig 
like you would expect a monkey to do - it’s very funny to see.

'It’s for attention - he wants someone to touch him.'

She added: 'He would get his head and shoulders through a cat flap but his body wouldn’t fit.

The agile feline jumps up on to his back legs and jigs about whenever someone comes into the room, said Maria Harrison, owner of the Willows Cat Adoption Centre

The giant moggy measures 3ft 3ins from his nose to the tip of his tail, making him one of the biggest cats in the country, it is thought

'He’s not obese, he’s just big.

'Wensleydale is not your average cat who can go to any home, so he just needs some help to find the right person.

'He needs a mature household with no children.

'I’d like to find him a house with a nice big garden where he can spend the rest of his days.'

- Anyone who may be able to give him a home should call the Willows in South Shields on 0191 4568511.
