So here's the question. If Petr Cech, at 33, is available in the summer, and Arsenal have a chance of buying him, what should be Arsene Wenger's best offer? 

Jose Mourinho says Cech can leave Chelsea if he wishes, but only for big money as he rates him one of the top three goalkeepers in the world.

The three most expensive goalkeepers so far: Gianluigi Buffon (£32.6m), Manuel Neuer (£19m) and David De Gea (£18m) – although all were 25 or under when they made their move.

Cech cannot command such a fee at his age. A better marker may be the £9m Liverpool paid for Simon Mignolet. Is Cech better than Mignolet? Yes. So if Chelsea asked for £10m for a 33-year-old reserve, should Arsenal be tempted? Yes again. 

The absence of a world class goalkeeper is holding Arsenal back. Cech could easily last another four years at the top, making him value at £10m. 

Pat Jennings was 32 when he switched from Tottenham Hotspur to Arsenal in 1977; he played his last game for the club in 1985 at the age of 39. There has never been a question over his worth and Cech could be as important.
