An Idaho woman is grinning and bearing her weekend arrest.

Andrea S. Espinosa, 25, of Meridian, was picked up by police early Saturday morning after a series of strange events.

Cops say a passer-by saw her walking along the side of the road in Boise about 3.45am and stopped to make sure she was ok.

Espinosa then got inside the man's car and told him to drive, police say.

Say cheese!: Andrea Espinosa, 25, was booked on suspicion of assaulting an officer and resisting arrest after she tried to flee in a stranger's car following an incident in Boise, Idaho, early Saturday morning

The man decided she needed help, so got out of the car and tried to flag a police car down from the road, according to The Idaho Statesman. 

That's when Espinosa allegedly got into the driver's seat and attempted to flee the scene.

Fortunately an officer was able to open the car door and stop Espinosa.

However she allegedly punched the cop in the face.

She also kneed the officer in the thigh as he was arresting her.

Eventually she was put inside a patrol car.

The incident occurred at the intersection of West Malad Street and South Orchard Street.

Espinosa was booked into the Ada County Jail. 

For her booking photo, she gave a very wide grin.

Espinosa has been charged with two counts of felony assault or battery on an officer and misdemeanor resisting or obstructing officers.

Her statements to police 'appeared confused and inconsistent'.
