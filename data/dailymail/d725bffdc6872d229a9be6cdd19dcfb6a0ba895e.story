Justin Bieber has backed a new smartphone app solely designed for people to share selfies.

The app, which is called Shots of Me, is available in Apple’s App Store and encourages people to take and share pictures of themselves with a smartphone’s front-facing camera.

It has an Instagram-inspired social network, which also links to Twitter to create a kind of network just for self-portraits.

Look at me: Justin Bieber (pictured) is no stranger to selfies but now he has financially backed a new smartphone app solely designed for people to share their self-taken portraits

The app, created by RockLive is part funded by Justin Bieber, who was reportedly attracted to the product because it does not allow people to leave any comments.

John Shahidi, CEO of RockLive, told TechCrunch that people enjoy looking at other people instead of browsing pictures of lunches and sunsets, which are common on other photo sharing platforms, such as Instagram.

The Shots of Me app features a feed of selfies from friends and Twitter contacts as well as their names, locations, captions and the amount of ‘likes’ a photo receives.

The anti-trolling aspect is said to have attracted Justin Bieber to Shots of Me, who told Mr Shahidi that he is annoyed by other platforms allowing homophobic slurs and hate messages to be posted.

Users of the app can only take photos of themselves using the front-facing camera of a phone and even then, can only take them via the Shots of Me app.

This means that no uploading of images is allowed in a bid to ‘capture the moment’.

Instead of leaving comments about selfies for all users to see, Shots of Me has a direct messaging system that invites messages from followers, in a bid to stop users criticising people in public - known as trolling.

Survey claims Britons take 35million ‘selfies’ every month.

More than 50 per cent admit snapping themselves with their mobile phones and cameras.

A quarter of those even admit to taking a sexy selfie, but 36 per cent later regret it.

Facebook is the most popular place to upload the photographs.

Three-quarters of young people aged between 18 and 24 admit taking selfies, the study by mobile phone company HTC found.

But the trend isn’t limited to the young. Twenty nine per cent, of those aged over 65 also take selfies.

The new craze, which involves posing by yourself before taking a picture, has risen in popularity, with over one million selfies taken every day.

The anti-trolling aspect is said to have attracted Justin Bieber to Shots of Me, who told Mr Shahidi that hs is annoyed by other platforms allowing homophobic slurs and hate messages to be posted.

Mr Shahidi told TechCrunch: ‘The commenting thing was something he really cared about. Not just for himself, but for the kids.

'He said: "I want a platform where my fans don’t have to deal with this." We didn’t ask him for money. He said “I want to be part of this.”’

The company had raised just over one-and-a-half million dollars, but Justin Bieber contributed the majority of the $1.1million second round of investment.

However, while this might be the popstar’s first publicly announced personal investment, he is believed to have backed a number of startups.

While some people might think Shots of Me is a vehicle for vanity, there is no doubt that people are sharing more selfies than ever on social networks and it will be interesting to see if this dedicated app can capitalise on the trend.

It faces stiff competition from established photo sharing platforms like Instagram, which has 150 active users as well as Snapchat, which allows users to post photos which are deleted within 10 seconds.
