She's become no stranger to holidaying on the French Riviera and it seems Princess Beatrice can't stay away from her favourite sunshine destination.

The fifth in line to the throne was spotted soaking up the sun on a super yacht with boyfriend Dave Clark surrounded by friends.

Beatrice looked casual in a black summer dress, flip flops and sunglasses as she boarded the luxury boat in Nice yesterday.

The Princess appeared relaxed as she sunbathed while her boyfriend cooled off in the sea.

The pair are no strangers to holidaying in France after a stay at the famous Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc on the Cap d'Antibes last month.

The couple checked into the hotel with friends to soak up the Cannes film festival atmosphere.

Soaking up the sun on a super yacht seems to be the couple's favourite way to spend a holiday.

Beatrice and Dave were also spotted enjoying a day on a yacht in St Tropez in July last year.

The previous year, the daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson and her beau spent much of June 2011 on a Â£400,000 super yacht cruising around the French coastline and stopping off for events such as the Monaco Grand Prix.

They looked very much in love in July 2010 when they were pictured on a luxury boat in St Tropez together.

The Princess has been enjoying the high-life of late, frequently snapped at glamorous parties with a host of different celebrities.

Beatrice and Dave even had a double dinner date with Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher last month.

The foursome were spotted on a boat with friends in St Tropez today.
