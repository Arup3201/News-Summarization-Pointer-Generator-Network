Children (and fussy adults) who dislike the infamous Brussels sprout usually only have to suffer them once a year on 25 December.

But nutritionist and personal trainer Tara Hammett is on a one-woman mission to make the little green balls of fun a staple over Easter too... by coating them in chocolate.

The 33-year-old, who manages a health club near her home in Swansea, South Wales, has invented a recipe for sweet, chocolatey treats that are a more nutritious alternative to sugary, calorific Easter eggs.

They may be healthier, but are thses little green balls really tastier than a Twix?

The fitness fanatic takes raw baby sprouts and dips them in melted chocolate. She has also coated crabsticks, olives, mushrooms, cheese and grapes.

Her healthy chocolate sprouts are packed with nutrients, vitamins and minerals, and pack a meagre 20-calorie punch, compared to the gut-busting 120 inside a Cadbury's Creme Egg, exactly the same size.

Brussels sprouts have only eight calories, compared to the 120 in a Cadbury's Creme Egg, the same size as Tara's chocolate-dipped sprouts

She said: 'I'm really pleased with the results. It is one of those combinations really shouldn't work but somehow it does.

'They might sound a little strange but trust me they taste pretty good - don't knock them till you've tried them.'

The bite sized balls are the same size as a Cadbury's creme egg but are a guilt-free treat.

Tara added: 'They are a great way of getting children to eat more vegetables. My nieces and nephews love helping me to make them - and then scoffing them afterwards.'

She will be trying the chocolate sprouts on her clients over the Easter weekend at the health club she manages in Swansea.

Tara's recipe involves raw baby sprouts, Green & Blacks cocoa powder and Lindt orange chocolate
