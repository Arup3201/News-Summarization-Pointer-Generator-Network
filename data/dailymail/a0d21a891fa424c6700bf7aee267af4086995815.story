The father of Josh Powell, who killed himself and his sons after his wife went missing in mysterious circumstances, has been sentenced to 30 months in prison for voyeurism.

Steven Powell will also spend three years on probation, and has been ordered to undergo a psychosexual evaluation.

Prosecutors in Tacoma, Washington had asked for an exceptional sentence of 10 years.

Powell's attorneys sought zero to 12 months, arguing that he might have taken the incriminating pictures before the state made voyeurism a felony in 2006.

Jailed: Steve Powell, shown being led into court on Friday, has been sentenced to 30 months in prison

Hearing: Powell at today's sentencing, where he got a sentence much more lenient than prosecutors wanted

The 62-year-old was found guilty of 14 counts of voyeurism by a jury last month.

He will get credit for time already served in prison, reducing his sentence to around 21 months.

Powell is the father-in-law of Susan Powell, who disappeared from her home in West Valley City, Utah, in late 2009.

His
son and her husband, Josh Powell, killed himself and his two young sons
in a February fire at a home in Graham. Josh Powell was the prime 
suspect in Susan's disappearance.

Steve Powell
was arrested last September after investigators searching his home for 
evidence in Mrs Powell's disappearance came across computer disks with
what they described as thousands of images of women and girls who 
seemed unaware they were being photographed.

Those
filmed, prosecutors say, included neighborhood girls, who were 
identified in court only by their initials and who were about eight and 10 
when the images were recorded.

Victim: Evidence relating to Powell's missing daughter-in-law Susan was not allowed to be used in the trial

Family: Powell's son Josh killed himself and his two children Charlie and Braden in February this year

The mother of Powell's
victims addressed him at sentencing, trembling and tearful as she stood
with her back to him. She said she is still waiting for an apology.

'You've
sat there smugly and acted as though it's perfectly normal to have 
committed your crimes,' she said. 'I'm so angry. I'm angry for the hurt 
you caused my children. You caused them embarrassment and heartache'

Powell, wearing a grey jail uniform, declined to speak in court.

Deputy
prosecutor Grant Blinn asked for an exceptional 10-year sentence, 
noting the number of offenses and that Powell not only secretly watched 
the girls, but 'memorialised' his offence by recording them so he could 
watch them over and over.

Powell's lawyers, 
Mark Quigley and Travis Currie, argued that 10 years was far beyond what
any other convicted voyeur has received in Pierce County. One other 
defendant charged with similar offenses received a sentence of 261 days,
but he took responsibility for his crimes.

Mr Quigley urged Judge Ronald Culpepper to pay no mind to the intense media attention on the case.

'We
can't ignore the fact that there's intense public interest in the 
outcome of this case,' he said. 'I would ask you not to punish Mr 
Powell for the conduct of his son.'

Before 
sentencing Powell, Mr Culpepper threw out two of the 14 voyeurism 
convictions, saying they appeared to be redundant - that is, Powell had 
faced multiple counts based on the same recording sessions.

Powell's
lawyers sought to have all but two of the counts dismissed - one count 
for each victim - on the grounds that the state couldn't prove the 
images were not all recorded in one long recording session on a single 
day.

The judge declined, saying he did not have enough evidence to overrule the jury's decision to convict him on those counts.

Among the 
images recovered from Powell's home were many of Susan Powell that
appeared to have been filmed without her knowledge, investigators said.
There were also said to be journals in which Powell detailed his obsession 
with his daughter-in-law.

Much of that 
evidence had been barred from the trial as unduly prejudicial against 
the defendant. Powell was not charged with acts of voyeurism 
involving Mrs Powell because authorities could not prove she was unaware of the filming.
