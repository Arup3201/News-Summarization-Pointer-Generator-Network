The former compound of a New Hampshire couple who infamously held off federal agents there to arrest them in a 90 day standoff has hit the market for a very reasonable $250,000.

The property is located in Plainfield on 100 acres and a features a large main house.

The only problem is the somewhat high likelihood there are also unknown explosive booby traps hidden around the grounds.

Up for sale: The home of Ed and Elaine Brown in Plainfield, New Hampshire

Birds eye: The home sits on 100 acres of land, most of which is wooded

Problem: Those 100 acres are quite possibly filled with explosive booby traps according to the former owner

Evaders: Ed worked in pest control and Elaine had her own dentistry practice, and neither thought they should have to pay taxes

Ed Brown worked in pest control and Elaine had a dental practice, and beginning in 1996 they stopped paying income tax or property tax claiming there was no law stating they were required too.

Then, when it finally came time to turn themselves in on these charges following their trial, the two stockpiled weapons and held off federal agents for 90 days, gaining a rather large following of supporters in the process.

At this same time, Ed noted that there were explosives hidden around the property to scare off trespassers.

For this reason, federal agents won't even let interested buyers tour the property.

Strong stand: During the standoff, Dan posted no trespassing signs and legal claims outside the door

No luck: The first auction bought in no interested buyers 

The house is being auctioned off, starting at $250,000, with all money going towards the Browns massive tax bill. 

Elaine is currently serving 37 years in prison and Ed 35 for crimes relating to both their tax evasion and the subsequent standoff they had with federal agents.

The two were finally arrested when two undercover officers pretending to be followers of their ideas and leanings were allowed in the house in October 2007.

Also on the market is the property that housed Elaine's old dental practice, which is pricier at $507,500 and located in nearby Lebanon.

According to The Washington Times,  Lebanon is owed $286,242 in back taxes for the dental property and Plainfield is owed $198,908 for the compound.

Not one person bid on the Palinfield property at the first auction.

After being convicted of tax evasion the two refused to surrender, stockpiling weapons and holding off for federal agents for 90 days

At this time Ed implied that the entire property was surrounded by booby trap explosives to keep people away

Now people buying the property can't tour the 100 acres of outdoor space as federal agents don't know where these bombs could possibly be
