West Ham manager Sam Allardyce says he is not shocked with comparisons made between new signing Cheikhou Kouyate and Patrick Vieira after his impressive debut against Tottenham on Saturday.

The 24-year-old, who joined for a reported £7million from Anderlecht earlier this summer, was the Hammers' star performer in the narrow defeat with his pace and power a constant thorn in the home side's midfield.

And his new manager was understandably delighted with Kouyate's first performance for the Irons.

Impressive: Kouyate was West Ham's star performer as they fell to a narrow defeat against Spurs

Powerful: Kouyate has plenty of pace and power in his locker 

Similarities:  Kouyate has many characteristics that Patrick Vieira had as a player

Impressed: Allardyce has drawn comparisons with Kouyate and Vieira

In his column for the Evening Standard Allardyce said: 'I thought he (Cheikhou) was our man-of-the-match against Tottenham last week and I, for one, would be delighted if he came close to emulating Patrick's consistent level of performance. 

'It was a brilliant debut and one which you don't see too often in the Premier League.

'Normally, when players first come here from abroad, they're shouting for pure oxygen because they struggle to cope with the sheer intensity of our game.

'Apart from right at the end against Spurs, when he did go down for a rest after yet another run, his fitness was superb — and infectious because the rest of the players will be saying to themselves: 'Come on, I've got to get up there with him.'

Allardyce will be hoping for more of the same of Kouyate's infectious displays from the rest of his squad as they look to bounce back from defeat to Spurs when they make the short trip to managerless Crystal Palace on Saturday.
