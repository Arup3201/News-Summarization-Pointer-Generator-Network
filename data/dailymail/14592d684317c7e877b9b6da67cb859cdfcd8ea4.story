Rebel fighters from Islamic militant group ISIS have captured four more towns in Iraq including a crossing on the border with Syria.

Qaim, Rawah and Anah all fell to rebels fighters yesterday, while civilians in the town of Rutba are negotiating a surrender after units stationed on the outskirts threatened to start shelling.

The towns, the first to fall in the mainly Sunni province of Anbar, were captured as Shiite volunteer soldiers marched through Baghdad as the country heads towards sectarian war.

The capture of Rawah, situated on the Euphrates River, and the nearby settlement of Anah, also raises the prospect that ISIS militants are marching towards a dam at Haditha.

If the dam and adjoining power station were destroyed, it would cripple the country's power grid and cause widespread flooding.

Iraqi military officials said more than 2,000 troops were quickly dispatched to the site of the dam to protect it against a possible attack by the Sunni militants.

Rawah's 
mayor, Hussein Ali al-Aujail, said the militants ransacked the town's 
government offices and forced local army and police forces to pull out.

Rawah and Anah had remained under government control since nearby Fallujah fell to the Sunni militants in January.

The
 capture of a border crossing at Qaim has allowed ISIS to move heavy 
artillery and vehicles from Syria with ease for use on Iraqi 
battlefields. Troops have long been able to cross unimpeded.

Syrian rebels have already seized the facilities on the Syrian side of the border and several other posts in areas under their control.

Police and the army said the Sunni insurgents seized Qaim and its crossing, about 200 miles west of Baghdad, after killing about 30 Iraqi troops in day-long clashes on Friday.

The officials said people were now crossing back and forth freely.

Chief
 military spokesman Lt Gen Qassim al-Moussawi acknowledged Qaim's fall, 
saying troops aided by local tribesmen sought to clear the city of 
'terrorists'.

The
 news will come as a fresh blow for prime minister Nouri Maliki, who has
 been desperately defending his position since ISIS began its lighting 
assault.

As ISIS made further gains in the Sunni west of the country, Shiite volunteer soldiers marched through Sadr city in Baghdad in a show of force

Forces loyal to anti-Western cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, a Shiite, joined in the marches which also took place in the southern cities of Basra and Amarah

Mr Maliki's Shiite-dominated government has struggled to push back against Islamic extremists and allied Sunni militants who have seized large swathes of the country's north.

The militants took control of the second-largest city of Mosul on June 10 as Iraqi forces removed their uniforms and fled without firing a single shot.

The prime minister, who has led the country since 2006, has been increasingly forced to turn to Shiite militias and volunteers to bolster his beleaguered security forces.

Parades 
took place in Sadr city, Baghdad, yesterday along with other cities in 
the mainly Shiite south as a show of force after weeks of terrible 
defeats for the government.

The
 marches revealed the depth and diversity of the militia's arsenal, from
 field artillery and missiles to multiple rocket launchers and heavy 
machine guns.

The military hardware on display yesterday, including missile launchers, heavy artillery, rocket launchers and machine guns, show how deadly a religious conflict could become

Mr Maliki has come under growing pressure to reach out to disaffected Kurds and Sunnis, with many blaming his failure to promote reconciliation for to the country's worst crisis since the US military withdrew.

Yesterday members of the Kurdish special forces were pictured being hugged by Shiite civilians in the country's north west after defending them from ISIS.

The unlikely images came after decades of violence between the two peoples which saw thousands of Kurds gassed by Suddam Hussein.

In Baghdad, about 20,000 militiamen loyal to anti-US Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, joined marches through the sprawling Shiite Sadr City district.
