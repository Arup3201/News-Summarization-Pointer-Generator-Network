Arsene Wenger offered a clear reminder of his role in Alex Song’s career as Arsenal prepare to face West Ham today.

Song’s midfield performances have inspired Sam Allardyce’s team this season and raised the question of why Wenger did not try to bring the Cameroon international back to the Emirates Stadium when Barcelona made him available on loan.

‘Alex Song is a good player,’ said the Arsenal boss. ‘I brought him here at 17 and kept him despite all the opinions against him and he developed into a very good player. You don’t need to convince me he’s a good player. I took him at a very young age and gave him his chance.

'I think he was a very good player when he was here and he didn't play a lot when he was in Spain - you see players like Santi Cazorla who always looks stronger (when they play regularly).'

Arsenal can leapfrog West Ham with victory on Sunday, and are just two points behind fourth-placed Southampton, but ahead of Tottenham only on goal difference.

With so little between the sides around the Champions League places, Wenger just wants his players to concentrate on continuing their recent positive form, which has seen just one defeat from eight in all competitions.

'I don’t give importance to the table at the moment,' he said. 'There are 20 games to go. It is very tight and it is down to consistency now.

'We know every game now is down to consistency and reproducing the performances. 'We need to prepare quickly, focus quickly and that is an ability we want to show at West Ham.'

Wenger is now well versed the in the traditional English hectic Christmas schedule.

'We want to stay in the game, to sleep well and then (go) again,' he said. 'It is very quick and interesting as well.'

Defender Laurent Koscielny (calf) could be available, while midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (groin) also faces a fitness test.

With Giroud now suspended for three matches, Theo Walcott is expected to return to the attack, having been on the bench against QPR.

Goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny knows Arsenal cannot afford to turn in a below-par display against the Hammers.

He said on Arsenal Player: 'We have to be at our best again because West Ham have been brilliant recently.

'It is going to be a difficult game, but I am hoping for three points.'
