It is often said that people from North America are obsessed with British culture because the history of the U.S. and Canada is relatively short.

But one Canadian family has taken their taste for the UK's past to the extreme and moved to England so that they could visit every historic site in the country.

David and Rosemary Ross are so passionate about the country's history they decided to uproot from British Columbia, Canada, to Upper Rissington in Gloucestershire, 10 years ago.

Since then, they have visited over 2,000 castles, monasteries, battlefields and monuments with their children Garett, 19, and Claire, 13.

The Ross family moved to the UK from Canada ten years ago to visit all the historical sites Britain has to offer. They are pictured at Hatchlands in Surrey

Rosemary and David Ross felt their children would learn more from visiting castles, monuments and other historical sites than in school. The family are pictured at Beeston Castle in Cheshire (left) and at Dover Castle, Kent (right)

The family of four spends more than 15 weeks of the year travelling up and down the country to soak up more of its heritage.

They even home schooled their children who were just 10 and four when they arrived in the UK so they would be able to join in on excursions. 

Mr Ross said: 'I think my children have learned more through visiting historic places than they ever would in the school room.

'Children who sit in front of the television just don’t get the experiences of standing in the footsteps of history.

Castle Howard in Yorkshire (pictured) is one of the 2,000 plus places the family has visited in the past ten years

Claire was just four when the family moved from British Columbia in Canada to live in Britain. She is pictured with mother Rosemary at Greys Court, Oxfordshire (left) and at Kidwelly Castle in Carmarthenshire (right)

'They
have probably both been to more historic places than anyone else their 
age in Britain and they really get something amazing out of it.' 

The father-of-two has an extensive collection of history and guide books, and even runs a tourist website offering people advice on the best sites to visit.

David said: 'Ever since I was a boy I have been passionate about historic places and fascinated by Britain.

'Tales of Robin Hood and King Arthur made Britain seem so romantic and fascinating, i just wanted to be there.

'Every
time I read about somewhere, or see a photograph, I want to visit and 
experience it for myself and share it with my family.'

Mr Ross is the editor of BritainExpress.com which offers readers advice on the country's best attractions.
