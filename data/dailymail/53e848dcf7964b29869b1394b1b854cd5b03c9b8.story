Missed: Reese Martin died after being given a drug that had been recalled, according to a lawsuit

The parents of a five-year-old who passed away after battling cancer have sued a drugs company, claiming he died after taking one of their products which had been linked to a nationwide fungal meningitis outbreak.

Barry and Regennia Martin, from Chattanooga, Tennessee, have claimed that drugs from the New England Compounding Center played a key role in the July 2012 death of their son Reese.

The drug, a muscle relaxant called Methocarbamol, had been recalled after inspectors discovered fungal and bacterial contamination in some of the NECC's products.

'Reese Martin, a minor, died as a result
of - in whole or in part - having a recalled product put into his 
body,' alleges the complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Knoxville, The Tennessean reported.

In their complaint, they say that the drugs were given to Reese shortly before his death but that they only learned his death might be linked to the product in October.

The nationwide fungal meningitis outbreak last year, believed to be linked to NECC drugs, led to the death of 64 patients.

But the suit does not name NECC as a defendant as it has since filed for bankruptcy. Its owners and affiliated companies, Ameridose LLC and Medical Sales Management, have instead been named.

Tragedy: Reese was at Children's Hospital at Erlanger in Chattanooga at the time of his death

There are several other lawsuits that have been filed against the NECC in this case; claims need to be filed within one year of the 'victims' becoming aware of possible liability.

Reese Martin was a patient at Children’s Hospital at Erlanger in Chattanooga when he died.

'Risk': Methocarbamol was recalled after inspectors found fungal and bacterial contamination

His cancer had been discovered after he apparently struggled to get over a cold and developed mouth ulcers.

When it failed to clear up, he was sent for an ultrasound and the nurse found a tumor the size of a football on his liver, and he was diagnosed with Stage 4 Neuroblastoma.

Reese was declared more than 95 per cent diseased and given a very low survival rate but in July the following year, he had just five per cent after chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant.

But at the beginning of 2012, doctors learned he had a brain tumor and gave him a zero per cent chance of survival, WRCBTV reported.

He told the Make-A-Wish Foundation that 
he loved trains and wanted to play in the snow, and numerous people and 
businesses from the area made his wish come true in April 2012.

But he lost his battle on July 5, 2012.

'He played hard, laughed often and loved completely,' his family said in his obituary.

'In his five short years, he filled each day with his favorite things –
toys, food, friends, girls and family. Trains, cars, fire trucks and 
balls were his favorite toys.'
