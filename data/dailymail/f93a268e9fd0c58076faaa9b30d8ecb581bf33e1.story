Extremist: Cleric Anwar al-Awlaki (pictured) was allegedly promoted in assemblies at one Birmingham school, Park View Academy

A Muslim headmistress told last night how she was driven out of her job by extremists bent on taking over state schools.

Her school is one of 12 apparently targeted by Islamic fundamentalists in a plot dating back two decades.

In a letter seen by the Mail, a fanatic brags about enlisting four radical parents to help oust her in 1993.

She said: ‘I was the victim of a pernicious, well-orchestrated smear campaign I have never been able to recover from.

‘People need to know this is a dangerous, well-organised and sinister group who have the capacity to destroy. They are producing fear in society and playing on paranoia. They are extremely powerful.’

The 69-year-old believes she was seen as an enemy because she was too moderate a Muslim. She was confronted with a number of allegations, including one of financial mismanagement.

Despite protesting her innocence her dismissal followed in 1994.

She added: ‘I was involved in a campaign so nasty that, since I lost the headship, I’ve never been able to raise my head above the parapet.

‘I was shocked to read this letter after 20 years and I am genuinely scared by it.’

Details of the extraordinary plot, which have been referred to the police, emerged on Friday after the letter was passed to Birmingham Council and a number of newspapers.

The unnamed author admits making false claims against several teachers in Birmingham in order to oust them.

The document discusses extending the ‘jihad’ operation to Bradford and Manchester – cities with fast growing Muslim populations.

Balwant Bains, former headmaster of Saltley School, said: 'I had to leave. I am trying to move away from a very horrible, horrible experience, and I am pleased that it has been exposed'

Investigation: There have been allegations of faked resignation letters at Adderley Primary School in Birmingham, possibly connected to a reported Trojan Horse operation by Islamic fundamentalists

The letter identifies specific schools
 as targets and names heads it claims to have ousted through dirty 
tricks campaigns, forged resignation letters and false allegations of 
cheating and financial irregularities.

It
 claims the former head of Birmingham’s Regents Park Primary, Tina 
Ireland, was forced to resign after the group ‘planted the seed’ that 
she was encouraging pupils to cheat in exams.

Another
 head, who is understood to have resigned following a plot to oust him, 
said he had been vindicated by exposure of the wider campaign, which the
 extremists called ‘Trojan Horse’.

Balwant
 Bains, former headmaster of Saltley School, said: ‘I had to leave. I am
 trying to move away from a very horrible, horrible experience, and I am
 pleased that it has been exposed.’

Another school – also named in the letter as a target – is alleged to have allowed extremist preachers into school assemblies.

Governors
 at Park View Academy, whose pupils are almost all Muslim, apparently 
organised an ‘extended Islamic assembly’ for its Year 10 and 11 children
 with Sheikh Shady Al Suleiman, who has called on Allah to ‘destroy the 
enemies of Islam’ and to ‘prepare us for the jihad’.

The
 academy was rated outstanding by Ofsted in 2012 and has been praised by
 the Prime Minister. But according to former staff, the Trojan Horse 
operation is taking hold.

One said a senior teacher at the academy repeatedly endorsed the terrorist ideologue Anwar Al Awlaki at school assemblies.

Awlaki, who was killed by a US drone strike in 2011, was a leading Al Qaeda recruiter.

A former supply teacher at the school told the Mail she was forced to wear the head scarf at work against her will.

Park
 View Academy, which is headed by Lindsey Clark, was given a snap Ofsted
 inspection this week after claims were raised of unfair treatment of 
non-Muslim staff.

The 
chairman of governors, Tahir Alam, is referred to several times in the 
letter as being involved in the plot. But the senior activist in the 
Muslim Council of Britain and vice-chair of the Association of Muslim 
Schools said the letter was a ‘malicious fabrication’.

Birmingham City Council has launched an investigation which is being monitored by police and the Department for Education.

The Mail understands Education Secretary Michael Gove met the leader of the council last month to discuss the documents.

The
 letter says: ‘We have caused a great amount of organised disruption in 
Birmingham and as a result we now have our own academies and are on our 
way to getting rid of more headteachers and taking over their schools.

‘Whilst sometimes the practices we use may not seem the correct way to do things you must remember this is a jihad.’
