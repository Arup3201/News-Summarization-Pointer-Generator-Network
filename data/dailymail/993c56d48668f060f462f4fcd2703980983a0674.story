The founder of Bikram yoga has been hit with yet another sex assault lawsuit as studios begin to drop his name in the first sign his empire may be crumbling.

Bikram Choudhury, 69, has been accused of raping a student during a teacher training event in the spring of 2010 when there was a 46 year age gap between them.

Jill Lawler alleged that Choudhury, whose followers include Madonna and Demi Moore, also assaulted her again after saying he would 'make her a champion'.

The lawsuit is the sixth such legal claim against Choudhury, who counts Chelsea Clinton and George Clooney among his admirers.

Choudhury pioneered Bikram yoga, also known as 'hot yoga', which involves participants working out in a room heated in excess of 40C (104F).

It has become such a success that are now around 720 Bikram Yoga schools in 220 countries including dozens in the UK.

Andy Murray also put his ascent up the world tennis rankings down to Bikram Yoga and David Beckham has also reportedly tried it.

But the New York Times has reported that in the U.S., several yoga studio owners have removed Bikram from their names because they don't want to be associated with it any more.

In California, Tiffany Friedman renamed her Bikram studio Haute Yogi Manhattan Beach and began offering a different range of classes.

She described Bikram as 'cultish' and said that people believed that Choudhury 'was a guru with all these powers'.

In her lawsuit Lawler said that that at the age of just 18 she signed up for a £6,000 teacher-training course in Las Vegas in spring 2010.

At the time Choudhury would have been 64.

The lawsuit states: 'Bikram Yoga was her calling, and that her purpose was to share it with as many people as possible.'

Bikram yoga, named after and devised by Bikram Choudhury, is based on regular hatha yoga, but performed in 100F temperatures.

Fans claim that it not only leaves them stronger and more flexible than standard yoga, it also helps them shed weight fast.

Choudhury began practising yoga in Calcutta at the age of three, spending up to six hours a day perfecting his poses. At 13 he won the National India Yoga Championship and went on to devise the 26 'asanas' (poses) and two breathing methods that form the core of Bikram yoga.

He claims to have been invited to the U.S. in 1973 by President Nixon to help him improve his health through yoga.

He also claims to have taught yoga to Reagan and Clinton and has a legion of celebrity fans 
including Lady Gaga, Madonna, Jennifer Aniston and tennis champion Andy 
Murray.

Choudhury says Bikram works because the 100F heat loosens the muscles, helping them to go further than they would otherwise.

Yogis perform the series of poses, pushing their bodies to the limit, and are encouraged to drink vast quantities of water to replace that lost by sweat.

Teachers say that if it gets too much for they, they should lie on the floor or leave the room for lower temperatures. Students, who carry a towel to mop up their sweat, are taught to watch out for danger signs including nausea, lightheadedness and dizziness.

Lawler, a Canadian, says that she massaged Choudhury for hours as they watched Bollywood films together and at one point he groped her.

He later apologized and said he would 'make her a champion'. Weeks after that however Choudhury asked Lawler to come to his hotel room where he sexually assaulted her, it is claimed.

The lawsuit states that Lawler continued doing Bikram yoga for years and that Choudhury's abuse continued on multiple occasions, the most recent being in February 2013.

Lawler taught her last Bikram class in July 2014 and is now working as a waitress. She was too afraid to speak up until now, she says.

In the lawsuit Lawler states: 'I went through total hell. What happened to me was awful. I'll probably always have bad dreams.'

A previous lawsuit was filed by another of Choudhury's followers, Sarah Baughn, who said that in the mid 2000s he whispered sexual things in her ear even though she was 38 years his junior.

During one exchange Choudhury supposedly said: 'Should we make this a relationship? I know you from a past life, and I have this feeling about you.

'In your culture, you call it love; I can't love, you know that (he had lectured on his beliefs on love and marriage the night before) but that is how I feel about you.

When Miss Baughn rebuffed his advances Choudhury is said to have sabotaged the her career as a yoga instructor.

Mary Shea Hagebols, a lawyer for the six women suing Choudhury, said that the cases were all 'moving very quickly'.

She said: 'Any stays have been lifted, and we're moving full steam ahead.'

Choudhury began practising yoga in Calcutta at the age of four.

He went to the US in 1973 at the invitation of President Nixon who was suffering from phlebitis and at the urging of actress Shirley MacLaine.

Over the years his devotees have included Martin Sheen and Michael Jackson. He now lives in the Hollywood Hills with multi-million pound fortune and a fleet of 40 Rolls Royces.

Choudhury is known for being outspoken in his self-belief and has in the past likened himself to Superman or Buddha.

He once told a business magazine the key to his success was 'because I have balls like atom bombs, two of them, 100 megatons each. Nobody f**** with me'.

He has also raised eyebrows by obtaining the copyright for the 26 postures and breathing exercises that make up the 90-minute Bikram Yoga routine.

In a statement Choudhury said: 'Their claims are false and dishonor Bikram yoga and the health and spiritual benefits it has brought to the lives of millions of practitioners throughout the world.

'After a thorough investigation, the Los Angeles County district attorney declined to file any sexual assault charges against Mr Choudhury or the college for lack of evidence.'
