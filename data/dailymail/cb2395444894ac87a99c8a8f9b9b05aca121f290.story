Staples is looking into a 'potential' credit card data breach - in what could be the latest case of a mega retailer falling victim to hackers. 

The office supplier retailer said it has been in touch with law enforcement officials about the issue.

It comes just over a week since Kmart joined an increasingly long line of retailers who have suffered massive credit card breaches this year, including Home Depot.

Several banks had noticed fraud patterns suggesting some Northeast Staples stores could have been breached, according to security reporter Brian Krebs, who first revealed the potential breach.

He said that 'seven Staples stores in Pennsylvania, at least three in New York City, and another in New Jersey' had potentially been hit.

There is no evidence that stores outside the Northeast have been affected, he said. 

It also wasn't immediately clear how many customers might have been affected. Staples had 1,800 stores across the country, but Krebs said the number affected was far smaller.

The retailer said that if it turns up any data discrepancies during its investigation, customers won't be responsible for fraudulent activity on their credit cards as long as it is reported in a timely manner.

Spokesman Mark Cautela said in a statement that 'we take the protection of customer information very seriously, and are working to resolve the situation'.

Credit card breaches at retailers often occur after malware - malicious software - is attached to card payment terminals, which allows hackers to steal credit card numbers when the buyer swipes.

Earlier this month Sears Holdings Corp. reported a data breach at its Kmart stores.

Other breaches have occurred at retailers including Target, Neiman Marcus, P.F. Chang's, Supervalu and Home Depot. 

At Home Deport, 56 million customer credit cards were put at risk of theft by data-stealing malware that had avoided detection.

Target also suffered a huge hack last year, leaving the credit card data of 40 million customers - and personal information of 70 million more - exposed to fraudsters. 

In a bid to avoid such hacks, the government has called for a move to more secure chip-and-pin technology, encouraging stores to stop relying on magnetic strip payment cards. 

Shares of Staples Inc., based in Framingham, Massachusetts, slipped in pre-market trading Tuesday.
