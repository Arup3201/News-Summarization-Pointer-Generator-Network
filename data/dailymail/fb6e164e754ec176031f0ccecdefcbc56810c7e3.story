Pep Guardiola's footballing philosophy is still lost on a German audience, according to Bayern Munich sporting director Matthias Sammer.

Despite Bayern sitting pretty with a 12-point advantage at the top of the Bundesliga, the Spaniard has still come in for criticism in some quarters.

Former players Dietmar Hamann and Lothar Matthaus, for example, have claimed that Guardiola's constant tactical tinkering is holding the team back.

But, after a 2-0 win over Freiburg on Tuesday, Sammer defended the boss who delivered a Bundesliga and German Cup double in his inaugural season and again has his side top of the table with the winter break approaching.

'The fact that not everyone thinks everything we do is great doesn't affect our thinking,' he told Sport Bild.

'It is not yet understood in Germany how Pep thinks. The system does not change to shoot the team in the foot.

'This idea is apparently new to German football. Bayern are happy and grateful that we have a coach like Guardiola who proves himself again and again.

'He is hugely influencing German football with his thinking.' 

Bayern's lead at the top of the Bundesliga table stands at 12 points with one game to play before the break

Sammer went on to respond to the comments of Hamann and Matthaus, saying he pities them for not being able to understand Guardiola's methods.

He added: 'As former professionals, [they] should ask themselves why and how someone like Guardiola makes a footballing choice.

'In the end I guess they can be happy they have something to discuss... I'm not trying to be disrespectful, I only wish they were able to understand.'

Goals from Arjen Robben - his 100th competitive strike for the club - and Thomas Muller ensured a routine win over Freiburg in which Bayern had 31 shots on goal.

They set a new record for the least number of goals conceded in the first half of a Bundesliga season, with just three let in during their opening 16 matches.

The players and Guardiola showed their appreciation to the supporters with a laser and light show at the Allianz Arena after the match.
