He's been a mentor to Justin Bieber for years, and it's alleged he tried to stage an intervention as the young singer's behaviour spiraled out of control.

But Usher told Nylon Guys that he's given Bieber, now 20, all the advice he can and as the Canadian is now an adult, it's up to him to 'manage' his life.

Usher, 35, said: 'I gave every bit of advice and always told him it was up to him if he really wanted this. Now that he has it, as an adult, it's his to manage.

The Voice coach added: 'Do I turn my head in shame based off of what I see, what I know? Nah, I don't because it's all part of life's process. Am I in it with him? Yeah.'

After being mentored by Diddy from the tender age of 15, Usher is an understandable advocate of the 'big brother' role in music.

He explained: 'Artistic development made me who I am. Somebody took the time to help me find what it is that works for me as an entertainer and who I am as a music maker.'

Usher has certainly helped Bieber to 
become a record star with over 12 million record sales, but in other 
areas, the mentoring hasn't seemed to help.Â 

Just this year, Bieber has been arrested
 for assault and DUI, been accused of vandalism and attempted robbery 
and this week has had to apologise for making racist comments in a 
video... before a second materialised.

'It's unfortunate,' Usher commented. 'I hate some of the things I hear. Is it all true? I don't know. But I will tell you this: Success comes with a price. Every person that has grown up, grows up with something. It ain't just perfect from the beginning.'

But while Usher is allowing his protege to make his own mistakes, he is undoubtedly there for him as a friend.

The pair were spotted hanging out together in New York's Central Park just last week.
