The FBI were tipped off about John F. Kennedy's assassination 13 days before the shooting but ignored it, according to a retired agent.

Don Adams, 82, was involved in the official JFK murder investigation.

He claims the Secret Service and FBI failed to properly investigate a right wing extremist who was recorded saying how the President would soon be 
shot 'from an office building with a high-powered rifle' and how 'they’ll pick up somebody within hours after…just to throw the public off.'

Chilling: Joseph Milteer (right) told Willie Augustus Somersett (left) that JFK would be shot 'from an office building with a high-powered rifle' 13 days before the incident

KKK-linked Joseph Milteer made the chilling threat 
to police informant Willie Somersett in the latter man's Miami apartment on November 9, 1963.

He also said an assassination attempt was 'in the workings'.

Adams later said he recognized Milteer in a photo taken at the scene of the shooting.

In his 2012 book, 'From an Office Building with a High-Powered Rifle', Adams claims the FBI had enough information to stop President Kennedy and his wife from traveling.

He also claims he was only allowed to ask Milteer five generic questions after the shooting, thwarting a proper investigation, the Miami Herald reports.

Milteer was not interrogated about his previously recorded statements to Somersett regarding plans to murder the president, nor asked where he was on  the day of the murder.

Milteer is said to have made the threat in Somersett's Miami apartment (building pictured)

Former FBI agent Donald Adams was assigned to the Dallas FBI office in 1962 and assisted in the JFK assassination investigation in 1964

The Secret Service and the FBI kept the recordings a secret from the public for three years after the assassination.

In 1978, the U.S. House of Representatives Assassinations Committee conducted a limited investigation of Milteer and published a portion of the transcript of Milteer’s recorded conversation with Somersett.

The committee found Milteer’s threat 'was 
ignored by Secret Service personnel in planning the trip to Dallas'. 

Word of Milteer’s threat may even have reached President Kennedy himself.

Somersett told the Miami Police that Milteer was jubilant about Kennedy’s death.

'He
said, ‘Well, I told you so. It happened like I told you, didn’t it?’” 
Somersett said, according to one report.

'I said, ‘That’s right. I don’t
know whether you were guessing or not, but you hit it on the head 
pretty good.’ He said, ‘Well, that is the way it was supposed to be 
done, and that is the way it was done'.'
