Maria Sharapova will resume her quest for a second Australian Open title having flirted with being part of the early-round cull affecting the women’s seeds. 

Russian qualifier Alexandra Panova led the world No 2 4-1 in the deciding set with two breaks of serve. But Sharapova showed her steely determination, saving two match points on the way to a 6-1, 4-6, 7-5 win.

The 2008 champion said: ‘My thought process was pretty negative, I was dwelling on what I was doing wrong and not being in the present. 

'It was a tough day but I pulled through, that’s all that matters. It gives me confidence that I didn’t play my best tennis but survived, sometimes that can be good.’

Tennis great Laver joins the crowds

It was good to see tennis royalty in the house in the shape of Rod Laver, sitting in the stadium that is named after him. 

Laver, 76, lives in California but usually returns for the Open. Australia reintroduced knighthoods last year, and some here believe he would be a fitting recipient of the honour.
