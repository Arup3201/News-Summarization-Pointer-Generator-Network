The U.S. economy grew last year at its worst rate since the recession, despite ending on a high.

The 1.7 per cent annual growth figure was roughly half the progression made in 2010 - although the economy did move at a promising annual rate in the final three months of 2011 at 2.8 per cent.

Americans spent more on vehicles and firms restocked shelves at the strongest pace in nearly two years, but growth was restrained by the biggest annual government spending cuts in four decades.

‘We're still repairing the damage done by the financial crisis,’ Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said today. ‘On top of that we face a more challenging world. We have a lot of challenges ahead.’

Businesses are expected to ease up on restocking in the first three months of 2012, which should slow first-quarter growth - and consumers may cut back spending if wages continue to lag inflation.

In the final three months of last year, consumer spending grew at a 2 per cent annual rate and income grew modestly at 0.8 per cent, which were both up on the third quarter.

Consumer spending makes up 70 per cent of economic activity. Much of the growth was powered by a 14.8 per cent surge in sales of vehicles and other long-lasting manufactured goods.

Business restocking, which can vary widely during the year, was the greatest contributor to growth in the last quarter of 2011. It added nearly 2 percentage points to the gross domestic product (GDP).

Government spending at all levels fell at a 4.6 per cent annual rate in the fourth quarter and 2.1 per cent for the year - the biggest drop since 1971. Federal defence cuts were a major factor.

The economy is measured by GDP, which covers everything from haircuts to hotel bookings to jet fighter planes. The estimated figure on Friday was the first of three for the fourth quarter.

Growth is likely to slow in the first three months of this year to below 2 per cent - largely because business restocking will slow, Capital Economics economist Paul Ashworth warned.

‘Overall, the pickup in growth doesn't look half as good when you realise that most of it was due to inventory accumulation,’ he said. But not everyone thinks the first quarter of 2012 will be weak.

Business investment in capital goods should be stronger, consumer spending firmer and government activity less of a drag, said High Frequency Economics analyst Ian Shepherdson.

Other data show the economy ended 2011 on a strong note. Firms invested more in equipment and machinery in December. People are buying more cars and consumer confidence is rising.

Unemployment fell to 8.5 per cent last month - the lowest level in nearly three years - after the sixth straight month of solid hiring. Even the depressed housing market has shown some improvement.

But many economists fear that a recession in Europe could dampen demand for U.S. manufactured goods and slow growth. Without more jobs and better pay, consumer spending is likely to stagnate.

The Federal Reserve signalled this week that a full recovery could take at least three more years and it will therefore probably not increase its benchmark interest rate until late 2014 at the earliest.

That was a year and a half later than it had said earlier. The central bank also reduced its outlook for growth this year, from as much as 2.9 per cent forecast in November down to 2.7 per cent.

The Fed also sees unemployment falling as low as 8.2 per cent this year. U.S. stocks fell after the Commerce Department data came out, with the Dow Jones dropping 0.29 per cent this morning.

‘The Fed is attempting to shield the economy from a potentially more severe recession in Europe,’ said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

‘Even though the economy improved last quarter there are a number of headwinds and a lot of uncertainty surrounding Europe, emerging markets and also U.S. fiscal policy.’
