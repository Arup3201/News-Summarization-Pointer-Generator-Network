A nine-year-old boy is in critical condition after he suffered a massive electric shock as he posed for photographs by the swimming pool at his birthday party.

Elijah Belden was in his family's backyard in Temecula, California for an early 10th birthday party on Saturday when he touched a metal post near the pool and fell to the ground.

His mother Aly rushed to help him but, not realizing that he had been shocked, she was also hit by the current, the Press-Enterprise reported.

The boy's baseball coach, who is also a deputy with the Orange County Sheriff's Department, then rushed over to help and, even though he was shocked, he managed to pull the boy to safety.

Injured: Elijah Belden, pictured, suffered an electric shock after touching an electrified metal pole outside his family's home on Saturday. He remains in critical condition in hospital

Elijah apparently touched a pole supporting the patio cover that had somehow become electrified. His family believes a string of frayed electric lights on the patio cover could have been responsible.

Belden's father Tony, 41, said he was in the house when he heard his wife screaming.

'She thought he was dead,' Belden told the Press-Enterprise.

'I heard, "Elijah's down." Hearing that, I was so disconcerted... I couldn't even figure out how to dial 911.' 

But his son was eventually rushed to a local hospital, where his body temperature was cooled, and the next morning, he was transported to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego. 

Support: His family shared an image on Facebook showing him in the hospital, where he remains in a medically-induced coma. Doctors found he has not suffered any damage to his brain of heart

Support: His mother Aly tried to help him but also suffered a shock while her husband heard their screams

A Facebook page updating friends on his health noted that he was in a medically-induced coma and remained in critical condition. 

The page, 'Pray for Elijah Belden', said that tests on Monday found that he had not suffered any damage to his brain of heart, while his lungs are also showing signs of improvement.

'All signs are leading in the right direction,' the family wrote on Facebook. 'The doctor said he is hopeful that within the next 5-6 days we will be able to have conversation with him.'

While also updating friends on his condition, the relatives running the page asked for people to share photos of Elijah and to wear pink in support of the boy.

Scene: The youngster was playing near the family's pool (pictured center) when he posed with a friend for a photograph and suffered the electric shock. He fell to the ground but was eventually pulled to safety

They hope that when he wakes up, he will see just how many people he has touched. 

The boy turns 10 on October 13 but his family held the party last weekend so that the weather was still warm enough for his friends to use the swimming pool. 

His mother and the baseball coach were not seriously injured.
