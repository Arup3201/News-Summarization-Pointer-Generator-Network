A pilot who saved the lives of 30 British soldiers by flying his helicopter one-handed has been awarded one of the RAF’s highest honours.

Flight Lieutenant Dan Cullen’s Chinook was flying at 115mph just 50ft above the ground when his co-pilot – who had been shot by the Taliban – lost consciousness and slumped forward on to his controls.

As the helicopter plummeted to the ground, Flt Lieut Cullen, who is nicknamed 'Dan Dare' by his comrades, pulled his co-pilot upright with one hand while fighting to regain control of the aircraft with the other.

Courage: Flight Lieutenant Dan Cullen, who saved the lives of 30 British soldiers by flying his helicopter one-handed, has been honoured by the RAF

For his skill and courage he has been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross – the RAF’s second-highest award.

The drama began when Flt Lieut Cullen, a veteran of five tours of Afghanistan, was sent to pick up troops who had been clearing a Taliban bomb factory in Helmand province, southern Afghanistan. As the soldiers sprinted to his Chinook, Taliban insurgents opened fire.

Flt Lieut Cullen, 31, of 18(B) Squadron based at RAF Odiham, Hampshire, heard a bang and felt a bullet pass inches behind him.

Another shot punched a hole in the cockpit window and wounded his co-pilot.

He said: ‘I looked round and saw a hole in the window, then saw my co-pilot had been shot in the foot. The next 30 seconds were the longest of my life as I fought every natural instinct to take off.’

Holding his nerve under enemy fire, Flt Lieut Cullen waited until every soldier was safely on board.

But shortly after taking off, his co-pilot lost consciousness. He slumped forward over the dual  controls, causing the Chinook to suddenly plummet towards the ground.

Flt Lieut Cullen reacted instantly, forcing his stricken colleague back into his seat with his left hand, while controlling the Chinook with his right.

Eventually, the injured co-pilot was revived sufficiently to be pulled into the rear where he was treated by other crewmen in the dramatic rescue in April last year.

DFC recipients are said to have carried out ‘acts of valour, courage or devotion to duty whilst flying in active operations against the enemy’.

The citation for Flt Lieut Cullen, who is married to Emma, 29, states: ‘Throughout this incident Cullen maintained a sublime level of composure that was an inspiration to his crew. His personal courage, strong leadership, exceptional flying skills and rapid intervention were directly responsible for the safe recovery of the troops.’

The award was one of 131 operational honours handed out last week for the period from April 1 to September 31, 2011, for actions during Operation Herrick 14 in Afghanistan.

They include the Queen’s Gallantry Medal given to an explosives specialist who spent eight hours in a narrow, pitch-black tunnel defusing a massive  Taliban bomb in Helmand last August.

The space was so tight that Captain James Fidell, 28, from York, could not wear body armour as he deactivated the 110lb device by hand in sweltering heat.
