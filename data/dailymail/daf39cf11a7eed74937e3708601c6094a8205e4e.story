They have been known for decades as ‘Chelsea Tractors’ after the upmarket London borough in which their well-heeled 4X4 owners drive them.

But now the title of ‘Chelsea Tractor’ capital of Britain has moved decidedly North - to oil-rich and rather royal Aberdeenshire in Scotland, toppling the trendy suburb from its claim to fame as the postcode with the most off-roaders.

Chelsea’s SW3 post-code has traditionally topped Britain’s 4x4 league table - despite the fact that the rugged vehicles are more likely to be seen on the school-run or outside a trendy restaurant than ever actually venturing off-road into a muddy field.

been given the name 'Chelsea tractor' in recent years because of its 
popularity with rich people in urban areas

But now having lost its crown to Scotland, it also has fewer than neighbouring Kensington and Knightsbridge.

The relegation coincides with five years of soaring 4x4 sales that has seen annual registrations almost double across the country.

Farmers are still the drivers most likely to own one but the list of top ten buyers is now dominated by property developers, landlords, company directors, finance chiefs and bankers.

The statistics from car insurer Admiral found that more than one in five drivers in some urban areas own a 4x4.

One in four drivers in Banchory near Aberdeen now own and operate a Land Rover, or other type of 4x4

The top ten is made up of well-heeled London boroughs, affluent parts of Aberdeenshire and the English Home Counties. Indeed Aberdeenshire takes up four of the top ten places, including first place.

One in four drivers has one in the table-topping market town of Banchory, which is just 20 miles from Scotland’s North Sea oil capital Aberdeen and is famed as the gateway to Royal Deeside.

It pips the London’s upmarket SW7 post-code of South Kensington and Knightsbridge at 23 per cent - almost on a par with the third place AB53 postcode of Turriff, which is also in Aberdeenshire.

Fourth place is London’s fashionable W8 postcode of Kensington and Holland Park (23 per cent) which pips Chelsea’s SW3 into 5th place (22 per cent) and Wadhurst in East Sussex (TN5) into sixth position (22 per cent).

Colourful terraced houses, Bywater Street, Chelsea, Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, where the stats for those owning 4x4s has dropped significantly

The statistics based on more than three million policyholders revealed that those with children are more than twice as likely to buy one.

Some one in seven (14 per cent) of drivers with at least one child have one compared to just six per cent of those without children.

Land Rover makes the three most popular models with its Range Rover top followed by the Freelander and Discovery.

The current popularity of 4x4s marks an astonishing turnaround since the mid-noughties when sales plunged after vehicle excise duty on the most polluting cars was doubled.

The slump followed protests by environmentalists over carbon dioxide emissions from ‘gas guzzlers’ that halted production at Land Rover’s factory in Solihull in May 2005.

Manufacturers claim fuel efficiency of new 4x4s has improved by 37 per cent in the past seven years and many cost less than a hatchback.

The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said sales of ‘dual purpose vehicles’ - a category of mostly 4x4s - have nearly doubled from 132,472 in 2009 to 248,003 last year.

Demand has been boosted by adverse weather including two recent severe winters and flooding.
