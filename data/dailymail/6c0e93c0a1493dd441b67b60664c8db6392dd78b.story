The northern New Mexico town of Los Alamos has been revealed as having the highest concentration of millionaires in America.

The town, which is home to a government nuclear weapons lab, topped a report after it was found that more than one in ten households is home to a millionaire.

Report findings state there are 885 millionaire households among the population of Los Alamos of around 18,000.

According to research by financial forecasters Kiplinger, the numbers give Los Alamos an 11.7 per cent concentration of millionaire households.

Los Alamos saw off competition from Naples, Florida, which was second, and Bridgeport, Connecticut, which was third in the list.

Experts believe the reason behind Los Alamos's unlikely success as the home to the highest concentration of U.S. millionaires is the nearby National Laboratory.

The facility is the town's biggest employer and is home to many of the nation's top chemists, physicists and engineers.

10. San Francisco, CaliforniaPopulation: 4,335,391 Millionaire households: 121,229 Concentration of millionaires: 7.5%

The inevitably high salaries these top scientists pull in contributes to the town's ranking for concentration of millionaires.

Kiplinger said of its report: 'If it weren’t for the national laboratory, Los Alamos might be just another stagecoach stop in the desert.

'Top chemists, engineers and physicists have pulled in hefty paychecks here since 1943, when the lab launched the Manhattan Project.'

Los Alamos is an unlikely candidate for the title of the U.S. place with highest concentration of millionaires.

The small, dusty city of around 8,000 households has just one public golf course and very few luxury shops, with those wanting to experience the high life usually driving 35 miles northwest to nearby Santa Fe.

David Thompson, from Phoenix Marketing International, who conducted the research, said: 'We put out our millionaire update as sort of an informational thing.

'People like to see where the millionaires are.

'Los Alamos has been No. 1 for quite some time, at least five years.'It’s because it’s a small area with a large percentage of highly educated and highly trained engineers and scientists.'

According to the Journal North, a spokesperson for the National Laboratory said the average salary for its 9,665 employees is $102,552. No employee at LANL makes more than $1 million annually.

Seventy-two percent of lab workers have a bachelor’s degree, 19 percent hold a graduate degree and 22 percent have doctoral degrees.

Los Alamos County Councilor Michael Wismer told Journal North: 'When you associate millionaires, you think of Cayman Islands or exclusive mansions, and that really doesn’t depict our community.

'Our largest employer is the laboratory, and people make salaries appropriate with their skill levels.

'We have a very high academic requirement at the lab. We have a brain trust that’s unique, and they’re paid well.'

Naples, Florida, known as the 'Paradise Coast' ranked second in the list of the highest concentration of millionaires in the U.S.

Second placed Naples, in Florida has a far higher number of millionaire households - over 12,000 - but these are spread over a population of 320,000 people.

The area surrounding Naples is known as the 'Paradise Coast, and is popular with wealthy holidaymakers and retired couples.

The combined area of Bridgeport, Stamford and Norwalk in Fairfield County, Connecticut, has an even larger number of millionaires - nearly 30,000 - across its population of nearly 917,000.

According to the Kiplinger report, the southwest Connecticut area is a 'hotbed for the sweater-vest and sailing crowd', while Norwalk boasts 13 private boat clubs.
