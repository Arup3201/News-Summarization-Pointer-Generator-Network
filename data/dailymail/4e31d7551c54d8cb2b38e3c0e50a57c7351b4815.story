Brendan Rodgers’ miserable week ended with a third defeat on the bounce as the Liverpool manager was jeered by his own fans at Anfield yesterday.

Rodgers’ team were beaten 2-1 at Anfield by all-conquering Chelsea in the Barclays Premier League on Saturday, the defeat coming on the back of losses at Newcastle last weekend and Real Madrid in the Champions League in midweek.

Liverpool are now 15 points behind Chelsea and seemingly out of the title race already. To make matters worse, sections of the Anfield crowd briefly turned on Rodgers when he took off fans’ favourite Philippe Coutinho midway through the second half.

'I didn’t think we were creating enough so I made the change,' said Rodgers afterwards.

'There wasn’t enough momentum. But the supporters are a big part of this, here. They are frustrated and I understand that.

'They have given us great support and we are going through a difficult period at the moment.'

Liverpool led early through a deflected striker from German international midfielder Emre Can. But Chelsea equalised through Gary Cahill soon after as goal-line technology was used to rule that the defender’s close range shot had crossed the line at the Kop end.

Jose Mourinho’s team won the game in the second half through Diego Costa but Liverpool were subsequently denied a penalty when referee Anthony Taylor failed to spot that Cahill had handled a shot from Steven Gerrard.

Rodgers added: 'The technology has been great. You see the replay for the goal and it was over the line.

'But it’s bitterly disappointing that later there was a big decision in a big game and we didn’t get it. 

'Our players gave everything and we should have got it. You have to see that. He had a clear look at it. Maybe he needed help from his linesman.

'But this is the situation we are at. We are not getting the rub of the green. It was a clear penalty and we should have got it.'

And even John Terry conceded that Liverpool should have been awarded a penalty, saying: 'We have had some not go our way, it evens itself out'. 

Rodgers was criticised in midweek for leaving out so many first team players for the game in Madrid. They all came back in to the team yesterday but to no avail.

'The changes led to criticism and I can take that,' added Rodgers. 'I have no issue with that. I did think it was unfair on some of the players who played but there we go. I wouldn’t do anything different. We just didn’t get the result.'
