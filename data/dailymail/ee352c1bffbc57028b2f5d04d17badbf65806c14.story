Iran is ramping up its nuclear programme in an underground bunker deep inside a mountain, diplomatic sources revealed today.

Iranian experts have carried out the necessary preparations at Fordow near the holy city of Qom.

It paves the way for the Islamic state to begin higher-grade uranium enrichment at the site on a former military base.

The machines, equipment and nuclear material needed have been transferred and installed at Fordow, the sources added.

They suggested the work itself - until now conducted above ground at another location - could start when Iran takes the decision.         

It coincides with a period of escalating tension between Western powers and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad after a U.N. nuclear watchdog report last month said Tehran appeared to have worked on designing a nuclear weapon, and that secret research may continue.

The United States and its European allies have seized on the unprecedented document by the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency to ratchet up the sanctions pressure on Iran, one of the world's largest oil producers.

Enriched uranium can be used to fuel power plants, which is Iran's stated aim, or provide material for atomic bombs if processed much further, which the West suspects is the country's ultimate intention.

A rare visit by Iran's intelligence chief to Saudi Arabia sought to refute U.S. claims that Tehran planned to kill the kingdom's ambassador to Washington, a senior Iranian official said today.

Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast said Iran also wanted to convince Saudi Arabia that the U.S. and Israel are seeking to sow seeds of discord between the two regional powers.

Intelligence Minister Heidar Moslehi was reported to have met the Saudi Crown Prince Nayef bin Abdel-Aziz Al Saud during his visit yesterday.

The prince is also the kingdom's interior minister. Initially, few reports emerged from the meeting.

Saudi diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to talk to reporters, said the two discussed regional issues, including developments in Syria and Bahrain.

Iran has dismissed the U.S. accusations that Tehran was involved in a plot to assassinate Adel Al-Jubeir, calling the claims 'absurd.'

Proliferation expert Shannon Kile noted 
that Iran earlier this year announced it would shift its most sensitive 
enrichment activity to Fordow but that the actual start would still be 
significant.

'Obviously, for people who are concerned about Iran's ability to break out and to enrich to weapons-grade this is a pretty good step along that route,' said Kile, of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.             

Iran's decision last year to raise the level of some enrichment from the 3.5 per cent purity needed for normal power plant fuel to 20 per cent worried Western states that saw this as bringing it significantly closer to the 90 per cent needed for a bomb.

Iran says the material will help fuel a research reactor.

Iran's main enrichment plant is located near the central town of Natanz. But the country said in June it would shift its higher-grade activity to Fordow, offering better protection from any military attack, and also sharply boost output capacity. 

'If conditions require, we will move 
(our) uranium enrichment facilities to safer locations,' said the 
Revolutionary Guard's anti-sabotage chief Gholam Reza Jalali.

Iran's main uranium enrichment site 
in Natanz in central Iran is built partly underground while the 
long-secret Fordo facility was built deep inside a mountain as a 
precaution from aerial attacks. Jalili said the existing infrastructure 
has already been 'a kind of deterrent' against attacks.

'Our vulnerability in the nuclear 
field is minimal,' Jalali claimed. 'If Americans and Israelis were able 
to attack and harm our nuclear facilities, they would have definitely 
done so by now.'

Jalali's unit was set up on an order from Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and is tasked with reducing the possibility and minimizing damage from potential military action against Iran.

Natanz is of key concern since it is the country's main enrichment site and the location of the bulk of its centrifuges - machines that are used for enriching uranium in a technology that can produce either fuel for power plants or fissile material for a nuclear warhead.

Natanz computers have been the target of a cyber attack in 2009 and experts there have had to battle a powerful computer worm known as Stuxnet, which has the ability to send centrifuges spinning out of control.

Iran acknowledged Stuxnet affected a limited number of centrifuges at Natanz but said its scientists discovered and neutralized the malware before it could cause serious damage.

Jalali did not elaborate on possible sites for the relocation of nuclear facilities but such an effort would be hugely complicated and would require places able to store the technology safely.

In August, Iran announced it was moving some of its centrifuges to Fordo, just north of the holy city of Qom, because that site offered better protection from possible airstrikes but did not later elaborate on the move or say whether the centrifuges came from Natanz.       

The United States and Israel, Iran's arch foes, have not ruled out military action if diplomacy fails to resolve the long-running nuclear dispute, which has the potential to spark a wider conflict in the Middle East.
