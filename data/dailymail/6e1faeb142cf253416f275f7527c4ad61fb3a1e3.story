Six climbers have gone missing while ascending Mount Rainier in Washington state, sparking a helicopter search.

The missing group includes four clients of Seattle-based Alpine Ascents International and two guides.

They were due to return from the mountain Friday. When they did not make it back, the climbing company notified park officials at around 4.30pm, Park Ranger Fawn Bauer said.

'The last contact with them was at 12,800 feet,' Bauer said.

Mount Rainier, southeast of Seattle, stands at 14,410 feet and attracts thousands of climbers trying to reach its summit every year.

The search for the missing climbers is focusing on the Liberty Ridge area, near from where they were last heard from, Bauer said. The search includes climber ranger teams on the ground and flyovers with a helicopter.

The last contact the group had with the climbing company was at 6pm Wednesday. They were scheduled to reach the summit of Mount Rainier on Thursday, with a day to climb down.

The group is equipped with satellite and mobile phones.

A small weather front that brought snow flurries and hail to the mountain moved in Wednesday, Bauer said. The weather has been clear since then.

Alpine Ascents' director of programs, Gordon Janow, said he wasn't ready to release information about the climbers.

'Let's hope they're found and that it goes well,' he said.

Details — such as ages, gender or hometowns — for the climbers were not immediately available, Bauer said.

Saturday afternoon, rescuers spotted camping and climbing equipment at 9,500 feet on Carbon Glacier, but there is no word at this time if the gear belongs to the missing party.

Last month, Alpine Ascents International lost five of the 16 Sherpa guides killed in an avalanche on Mount Everest.
