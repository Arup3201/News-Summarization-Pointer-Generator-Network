Dramatic arrival: Jo Tointon with baby Eddy, who was born only hours after she plunged 10 feet through her bedroom floor

A pregnant woman went into labour after falling 10 feet through her bathroom floor.

Jo Tointon, 37, thought she had broken her back when she landed in her kitchen of her home in Sherwood, Nottingham.

But she was able to call paramedics - and then felt as if she was going to give birth.

Mrs Tointon, who was 35 weeks pregnant, was taken to the city's Queen's Medical Centre, where her son Eddy Austin, weighing 4lb 11oz, was delivered by Caesarian section hours later.

She and her husband David, 33, only moved into the home two months ago and been renovating the bathroom in anticipation of Eddy's arrival.

Mrs Tointon was discovered in the kitchen by her son, Ollie, two, followed shortly by her father Nigel Baxter, 64, who had been in the bathroom with her when she fell.

Mrs Tointon said: 'There was nothing but plasterboard and joists and I must have missed a step and fell through to the kitchen.

'I fell through and my feet hit the breakfast bar in the kitchen.

'I think that's what saved me as it broke the fall, and I bounced off on to the floor.

'I thought I had broken my back because I couldn't move, but it turns out I was just winded.'

Mrs Tointon, a fundraising manager, only received light bruising as a result of the fall but there were fears for her unborn baby.

She said: 'The paramedic asked if I was bleeding at all.

'I didn't think I was, but when I moved I could feel something and I knew it was either blood and I was losing the baby, or my waters had broken.

'They had to check me first before checking my baby, and it felt like forever before they checked for his heartbeat.'

Eddy, who was born on June 1, is still in intensive care after suffering a collapsed lung, but his health is improving.

Mrs Tointon said: 'I didn't realise at the time how close we came to losing him, but he's getting stronger by the day.

'We can't thank the medical staff in the neo-natal unit at the hospital enough - they have been truly amazing.'

Mr Baxter described the moment he watched his daughter fall.

He said: 'I rushed down the stairs to the kitchen, and Olly was already in the kitchen screaming.

'I thought the worst when she disappeared through the floor - that she could have been paralysed, or even died.'

Mr Tointon was at work at the time and returned home to his wife as soon as he could.

'I got the call to say there had been a terrible accident,' he said.

'I ran back home and saw the ambulances, and tried to calm her down, but it was really worrying.'

New arrival: Eddy weighed 4lb 11oz when he was born at the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham
