A woman with a penchant for tattoos has covered her body in 17 different inkings - including over her mastectomy scars - to depict each chapter of her life.

Joanne Jackson, 43, from Dewsbury, West Yorks., was diagnosed with breast cancer in June 2011 and later underwent a mastectomy.

But rather than let it affect her confidence and self-esteem, Joanne - in her words - 'kicked cancer in the ass'. 

Breast cancer survivor Joanne Jackson  has turned her body into a canvas to erase her cancer ordeal

The mother-of-two had a breast reconstruction and to erase her cancer ordeal, she has turned her body into a canvas.

Joanne, from Thornhill, Dewsbury, said: 'It's a statement of intent and a show of strength for what I've been through. 

'I don't drink and I don't smoke but ink is my thing. I am a collector of fine art, which just happens to be on my body and not on my walls.'  

Joanne, who is married to Andrew, 47, and has two sons Evan, seven, and Connah, 22, had her first tattoo - a small bird on her thigh - aged 21. 

Now she has a 'full sleeve' on her left arm depicting strong women, Geisha girls and Samurai warriors. 

The sleeve, created by tattoo artist Matt Evans, of Slawit Ink in Slaithwaite, took 20 hours and five sessions to complete. 

This brightly coloured peacock has taken 14 hours and is yet to be completed. The blue tail fathers across Joanne's stomach hide the scars from surgery to remove fat needed for the breast reconstruction.

Joanne was diagnosed with breast cancer in June 2011 and later underwent a mastectomy. She posed for these pictures in 2012 to prove that women could still be sexy and confident after the dramatic surgery.

A  brightly coloured peacock, the work of Kim Walsh, of Ink Station in Heckmondwike, sweeps  around her body. It has taken 14 hours so far and will be finished in the next couple of weeks.

Surgeons took fat from her stomach for the breast reconstruction leaving scarring from hip to hip. Those scars are now hidden beneath the blue tail feathers of the peacock. 'It's a stunning piece,' said Joanne. 

'It marks an end to what I have been through.' 

Joanne's other tattoos include a cancer ribbon on her back and a breastfeeding mother with four lilies to signify the four miscarriages she suffered. 

She also has famous quotations from Eleanor Roosevelt, First Lady of the United States and wife to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, on her left thigh. 

One of the quotes reads: 'You gained strength and courage by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. You are able to say to yourself I have lived through this horror and I can the next thing that comes along. You must do the thing you think you cannot do.'

In 2012 Joanne commissioned a photographer to take pictures of her posing topless after her mastectomy. She wanted to prove that women could still be sexy and confident, she says. 

She posted the pictures on Facebook and was furious when the social network removed them and threatened to close her account. 

Joanne admits she is running out of bare skin but has planned a few more tattoos - including one on her thighs and ribs. 

She added: 'I know tattoos aren't everyone's cup of tea but they have come a long way from the days when they were associated with yobs and thugs. 

'It's such an art form and there are some amazing tattoo artists out there and I have found two of them. This is what I do and I am growing old disgracefully!'
