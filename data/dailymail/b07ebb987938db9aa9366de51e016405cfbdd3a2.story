Jackie Kennedy hated Martin Luther King so much she could barely look at photographs of him.

In interviews taped in 1964 but only just released, she said the black civil rights leader was a ‘terrible man’ and a ‘phoney’.

She claimed King bragged of being drunk at her husband John F Kennedy’s funeral and had been caught trying to set up an orgy.

Claims: Jacqueline Kennedy was said to have seen Martin Luther King as a 'terrible' man

The interviews also revealed that JFK 
was so worried about vice-president Lyndon Johnson succeeding him that 
he schemed with his brother Robert to stop it happening.

Seven conversations between Mrs 
Kennedy and Arthur Schlesinger, a historian and Kennedy aide, were taped
 in the months after the president’s assassination on November 22, 1963.

Their release is timed to mark the 
50th anniversary of the Kennedy-era administration, where the White 
House became known as ‘Camelot’.

Worried: JFK, pictured here with Lyndon Johnson in 1960, was said to have had concerns about what would happen if his former rival and Vice-President took office

Mrs Kennedy said her view of   King 
was formed after being told of secret FBI wiretaps which showed him 
trying to organise a sex party before he attended the March on 
Washington in August 1963, at which he delivered his ‘I Have a Dream’ 
speech.

She said her brother-in-law Robert told her that King made 
disparaging remarks about JFK at the funeral and about Cardinal Richard 
Cushing, who delivered the eulogy.

‘I just can’t see a picture of Martin
 Luther King without thinking, you know, that man’s terrible,’ she said.

Skeptical: JFK was said to have thought that U.S. participation in Vietnam was 'hopeless', according to newly-released interviews with Jacqueline Kennedy

Texas-born Lyndon Baines Johnson was sworn in as U.S. president on November 22, 1963, around two hours after JFK was assassinated at 12.30pm.

Johnson had been in the car behind Kennedy when the assassination took place.

Despite initial fears he had also been shot or suffered a heart attack, Johnson was not hurt and was instead rushed from Dallas to Washington amid fears he may be targeted.

Flanked by Jacqueline Kennedy on Air Force One two hours later, Johnson was inaugurated as president by Federal Judge Sarah T Hughes - the first time a woman had administered the presidential oath.

After Air Force One landed at Andrews Air Force Base, Washington, President Johnson gave a speech at 6.10pm, less than seven hours after JFK's death.

He said: 'This is a sad time for all people. We have suffered a loss that cannot be weighed. For me, it is a deep personal tragedy.

'I know that the world shares the sorrow that Mrs. Kennedy and her family bear. I will do my best. That is all I can do. I ask for your help--and God's.'

‘He made fun of Cardinal Cushing and 
said that he was drunk at it [the funeral] – and things about they 
almost dropped the coffin. I mean Martin Luther King is really a tricky 
person.’

She said Robert told her of the FBI 
wiretaps: ‘He said this with no bitterness or anything, how he was 
calling up all these girls and arranging for a party of men and women, I
 mean, sort of an orgy.’

Over the seven sessions, Mrs Kennedy 
recalled conversations on topics ranging from her husband’s reading 
habits to the botched Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961.

But the sharpest criticism was for 
Johnson, who John F Kennedy chose as his running mate in 1960. Mrs 
Kennedy said her husband would say to her: ‘Oh, God, can you ever 
imagine what would happen to the country if Lyndon were president?

‘And Bobby told me that he’d had some discussions with him ... do something to name someone else in 1968.’

Johnson was sworn in as president 
after JFK’s assassination and won a full term for himself in 1964. He 
declined to seek re-election in 1968.

Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of John
 and Jackie, said her mother’s comments about King were evidence of the 
‘poisonous’ activities of then FBI director J  Edgar Hoover.

She said the comments didn’t reflect 
her mother’s true feelings about King, pointing out that she was proud 
to attend his funeral following his assassination in April 1968.

She added: ‘The description of Lyndon 
Johnson here is more of his capabilities as a president, more negative 
than she certainly felt about him as a person.’

In June, an extract of one of the 
interviews had Mrs Kennedy saying her husband felt his legacy would be 
secured if he was assassinated after his Cuban missile crisis success of
 1962.

‘If anyone’s going to kill me, it should happen now,’ he supposedly said.

Professor Robert Dallek, a Kennedy era
 historian, has said JFK’s remark may have been inspired by the 
assassination of Abraham Lincoln.

Lyndon Johnson for the death of JFK, who took over the post from her 
husband after his assassination
