When Jeeby Burns boarded the 218 bus to got go home with her 15-month-old daughter, she expected a bit of sympathy when she didn’t have the 20p the driver asked for.

Instead, the 26-year-old was met with a confrontation and after getting off the bus in Tonbridge, Kent, the driver ‘flipped the bird’ at her.

Fortunately for Waitrose worker Mrs Burns, she had her camera ready and managed to get a picture of the driver and his offensive gesture.

She tried to pay a £2.20 fare with a £10 note for the one-and-a-half mile journey from Tonbridge Castle to the stop near her house.

She was asked for the 20p, but when she said she didn’t have any change on her, Mrs Burns and her daughter, Sophia, were ordered off the bus.

Fortunately, a valiant passenger came to her rescue when he saw how embarrassed she became over the exchange and offered her a 20p piece.

Mrs Burns completed the journey, but hostilities continued and with the driver refusing to give his name, she took a photograph instead so that she could file a complaint.

She said: ‘I was so upset and shocked. I was with my little girl at the time. I think the way he treated me was just not right.

‘He asked if I had 20p and I said “sorry that’s all I have”. He said “you have to get off the bus”.

‘I was so embarrassed. All the passengers were looking at me and shook their heads.

‘One man asked me how much I needed and he gave me the 20p.’

It was only when she returned home on November 11 and looked at the picture, that she realised in the process of having his face photographed, the Arriva driver had stuck his middle finger up at her.

‘As I was getting off the bus I had my phone camera ready to take a photo. I took a picture of his face.

‘I didn’t realise at first he gave me the middle finger because of the light shining on the window.’

She added: ‘I don’t think he should treat other people like that. I’m still in shock.’

Mrs Burns conceded that the exchange of words became ‘heated’ but added: ‘He didn’t have to be rude to me over 20p. It’s just not right.’

An Arriva spokesman said: 'We have investigated Mrs Burns’ complaint and this investigation has included interviewing our driver and checking the digital CCTV images recorded on the journey in question.

'We cannot condone the driver’s action and he has been suitably disciplined.

'He is a long-serving employee with a good record and he is extremely sorry that he acted in the way he did but he is adamant that he did not swear at Mrs Burns and did ensure that she got to her destination.

'However, he did experience considerable verbal abuse from Mrs Burns which has been verified by an independent witness and can be seen on the CCTV footage which also shows her arguing with other passengers.'
