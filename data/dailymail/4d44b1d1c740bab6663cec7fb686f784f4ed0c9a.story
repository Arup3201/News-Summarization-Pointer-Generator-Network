He spent years appearing in patchy romantic comedies such as critically panned Fools Gold, How To Lose A Guy In Ten Days and Failure To Launch.

But Matthew McConaughey celebrated a remarkable career turnaround on Thursday with his first Oscar nomination.

The 44-year-old Texan-born star received a Best Actor nod for his powerful performance as AIDS campaigner Ron Woodroof in Dallas Buyer's Club.

The race is on: Matthew McConaughey, pictured at Sunday's Golden Globes, is up against four-time-nominee Leonardo DiCaprio after receiving a Best Actor Oscar nomination on Thursday

McConaughey shed 50lbs to play Ron 
Woodroof in the film, based on the real-life tale of an AIDS patient who
 began smuggling unapproved pharmaceutical drugs into Texas when he 
found them effective at improving his symptoms.

'I’ve got a pretty full tank
 of energy when it comes to what we did in this film,' he told The Hollywood Reporter in the wake of his nomination. 'I’ve got a lot of 
stories to share. It excites me to share the 
story each time I talk about it. There’s always a fresh subject. It 
means something different to everyone.'

His chances of scooping the big prize increased tenfold when he beat acting legends Tom Hanks and Robert Redford to win the Golden Globe for Best Actor In A Motion Picture, Drama on Sunday.

In
 the running: The five Best Actor nominees for the 86th Academy Awards 
were announced by Chris Hemsworth and Academy President Cheryl Boone 
Isaacs in Los Angeles on Thursday

Role of a lifetime: McConaughey has received a slew of nominations during awards season for his role as Ron Woodroof in Dallas Buyer's Club

Now, many commentators believe he can beat four-time Oscar nominee Leonardo DiCaprio to the prize at the prestigious ceremony on March 2.

DiCaprio was first nominated back in 1994 in the Supporting Actor Category for What's Eating Gilbert Grape before receiving Best Actor nods for The Aviator in 2005 and in 2007 for Blood Diamond. 

Having scooped the Golden Globe for Best Actor in the comedy category on Sunday, DiCaprio will certainly provide stiff competition for McConaughey for his critically acclaimed role in Martin Scorsese film The Wolf Of Wall Street where he plays banker Jordan Belfort.

Star turn: Christian Bale's performance as a 1970s con artist in American Hustle won his his second Oscar nomination

DiCaprio and McConaughey are up against Christian Bale for his role as 1970s con artist Irving Rosenfeld in American Hustle and Chiwetel Ejiofor as a free man sold into Slavery in 12 Years A Slave. 

Veteran actor Bruce Dern, 77, rounds off the Best Actor contenders for his part as eccentric father Woody Grant in Alexander Payne's road trip film Nebraska.

As a first time nominee, McConaughey would normally be considered something of an outsider at the Oscars, but his Golden Globe win and Screen Actor's Guild nomination may give him the edge over DiCaprio who has not been recognised this year at the SAGs.

Acclaim: Chiwetel was nominated alongside his 12 Years A Slave co-star Lupita Nyong'o, who will compete in the Best Supporting Actress category

In an interview with GQ
 last year, McConaughey revealed he decided to make a change in his career around the time of his 2009 
film The Ghost Of Girlfriends Past - a critically panned rom com based loosely on a Christmas Carol.

He
 described the perception of him at that time as 'Outdoors, shirtless on
 the beach, does a lot of rom-coms, girlfriend loves him, good-looking. 
It's like he rolls out of bed and shows up and makes it look easy.'

Although he 'enjoyed himself' doing the rom coms, the Magic Mike star felt the need to 'shake 
things up' in his acting career. He wanted, he said, to enjoy watching 
his movies as much as he enjoyed making them. 'I wanted new 
experiences,' he admitted.

Cue
 a two year acting hiatus which saw McConaughey  go 'into the shadows,' concentrate on his personal life and children with wife Camila Alves and wait 
for projects which would 'evolve' him as an actor.  

Panned: McConaughey appeared alongside Kate Hudson in rom com Fools Gold back in 2008

Failure To Launch: The actor appeared alongside Sarah Jessica Parker in the 2006 flop

He returned in 2011 thriller The Lincoln Lawyer, a much darker film based on the crime novel of the same name.

Male stripper film film Magic Mike was next, where McConaughey
 would show off his famous six pack, and 2013 coming-of-age-drama film Mud 
where he played a fugitive drifter.

Then came Dallas Buyer's Club, a low budget movie which McConaughey had been pushing to make for a while. The rest is now history.

'I'm
 in the clay in my career,' he told GQ. 'I'm turned on. I'm interested 
in things. I saw Dallas Buyers Club. I liked it. I liked that guy. I 
didn't catch you acting, McConaughey. I forgot that was you, 
McConaughey.'
