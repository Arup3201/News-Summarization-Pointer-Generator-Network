No love for familiarity: Judge John Foster has been accused of discrimination

To most in the county, it is a term of endearment.

But one Yorkshire judge takes such offence at the use of the word 'love' as a term of address, he has banned it from his courtroom.

Barnsley Magistrates' Court Judge John Foster has ruled that defendants should no longer be permitted to reply 'yes, love' when confirming their details with the court clerk or legal adviser.

Instead, they have been ordered to answer: 'Yes, ma'am.'

Judge Foster claims the word 'love' is 'disrespectful' and has ordered all defendants in his court to abide by the new rules.

The district judge imposed the ban after his legal adviser Pam Bower asked a 42-year-old defendant if he would confirm his identity during a recent hearing and got the reply: ‘Yes, love.’

The man, who was on remand and appearing on a video link, was later freed from custody on conditional bail.

Judge Foster, 64, said courts ‘have to maintain proper standards’, adding: ‘Courts are solemn places and serious.

'They are not places for chatty discussions.’ But regional campaign groups condemned the move.

Graeme Garvey, from the Yorkshire  Dialect Society, said: ‘The judge is, himself, being discriminatory in insisting on Standard English usage over traditional Yorkshire dialect.

'Love'
is a non-sexual term which has been and is used by people of both 
genders to people of both genders. It is a term of endearment.

Love-free zone: From now on, defendants appearing at Barnsley 
Magistrates Court, above, are to address female court staff as 
'ma'am'

'The
key issue regarding the current case is if the usage is patronising and
that is a value judgement not susceptible to objective proof.

'If it is not used patronisingly then
the judge, himself, is in error. If the plaintiff were to arraign the 
judge for linguistic discrimination, I feel he would have a strong 
case.'

Keith Madeley, from the Yorkshire 
Society, an organisation which encourages business and all things 
Yorkshire, added: 'I think that you've got to be careful that you don't 
lose the affectionate terms that we use for each other as part of our 
regional dialects.

'If the 
term is used in the right way I see nothing wrong with it, in other 
parts of the country I believe they refer to one another as "duck", are we
going to stop that as well?'

Defending against the cries of foul against the Yorkshire dialect the Judicial Office on behalf of Judge Foster said: 'He simply asked the defendant to observe ordinary courtesy and respect towards an officer of the court. 

'And that the standards demanded upon this occasion were no different to those applied in every other court in the land on every day upon which they sit.'
