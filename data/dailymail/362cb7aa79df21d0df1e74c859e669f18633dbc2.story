A group of families and their children have miraculously escaped serious injury after a coach flipped over on a motorway and ended up in a ditch.

The vehicle with 53 people on board was heading to Weston-super-Mare when it crashed and overturned on the M5 between Junctions 13 and 14, near Dursley, Gloucestershire, this morning. 

The ambulance service said six people - one child and five adults - suffered minor injuries during the incident.

Prospect Coaches said nobody was available for comment and said all updates would come from union The Confederation of Passenger Transport UK (CPT).

The South West Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust described the injured as 'walking wounded'.

'There were six casualties and all of them sustained minor injuries. They are being assessed at the scene to see if they need to be taken to hospital.'
