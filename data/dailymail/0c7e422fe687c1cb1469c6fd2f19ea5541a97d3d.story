Going home: A federal judge let 34-year-old Julia Bagdanov go free on bail after she was charged with her parents in a shoplifting spree

A federal judge allowed Julia Bogdanov do go free on bail today after the 34-year-old woman was busted in a shoplifting ring with her parents.

Bogdanov will be allowed to live at her family's $1.4million home with her sister during the trial, while her parents will remain behind bars without bond.

Julia was arrested along with her parents Branko, 58, and Lela Bogdanov, 52, earlier this month after federal authorities discovered they stole $7million in merchandise over the past 10 years.

In their decade-long spree, the related trio stole dolls, toys, cosmetics and other valuables and sold them online for more than a total of more than $4million.

Lela Bogdanov frequently donned a long black skirt with large compartments sewn on the inside during the alleged shoplifting binges and was caught on surveillance cameras leaving some stores with her skirt looking notably fuller than when she entered, the criminal complaint says.

Federal prosecutors successfully argued that Branko and Lela Bogdanov were flight risks, since both are in the United States illegally. The couple emigrated from the former-Yugoslavia.

'This defendant has nothing to lose,' prosecutor Renato Mariotti said of Branko Bogdanov at Monday's hearing. 'I think if you let him go ... he'll disappear.'

The couple have been accused of lying to authorities since getting arrested earlier this month.

Prosecutors say Branko has been concealing his wealth by saying he's $28,500 in debt and owes $1.3million on his house and 12 vehicles - which include a Lexus and Corvette.

Lela, on the other hand, has been accused of pretending to be sick.

Mariotti pointed out the fact that  Lela's slow shuffle in court doesn't match up to her behavior on surveillance video which shows her sprinting out of stores with toys and other items concealed in her skirt.

Her attorney argued that his client wasn't faking her illness and that she has cancer.

Lela, who has to speak through a Romani-translator, is 'functionally illiterate' and is dependent on her five U.S.-born children her attorney said. She also doesn't have a driver's license.

'She has no way to take herself to (the former) Yugoslavia,' her attorney said. 

The United States Secret Service brought down the Bogdanovs after Barnes and Noble Inc. and Toys R Us Inc. contacted the agency about what the complaint describes as 'a huge loss in merchandise'.

With the help of those companies and eBay, authorities traced stolen items to an online trading account of the cooperating witnesses, who, in turn, agreed to help in the investigation of the Bogdanovs.

A conviction on the one count of interstate transportation of stolen property carries sentence of up to 10 years.

And this isn't the first time a member of the Bogdanov family is facing jail time for stealing.

According to public records, father Branko has a previous theft conviction from Georgia in 1989, and was convicted of burglary in Texas in 1977.

Mother Lela was a criminal history in Pennsylvania, and plead guilty to charges of engaging in a criminal conspiracy, receiving stolen property and retail theft in December 200.

Same goes for their daughter Lela who has several arrests herself, including for theft in Florida in July of 1997.

Public records state that the family's median household income is $108,333.
