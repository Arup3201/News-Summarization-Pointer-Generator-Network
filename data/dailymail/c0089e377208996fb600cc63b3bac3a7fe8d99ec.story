A California mother who had a stroke while surgeons were operating on her brain is no longer able to recognize faces or her own reflection.

Tara Fall, who has suffered from prosopagnosia, or face blindness, for ten years, can recall conversations and details about the way a person dresses, but that is all.

The 37-year-old has to rely on a process of elimination to help her recognize people, including her two daughters.

Memory blindness: Tara Fall is unable to recognize faces, even those of her husband and children

'If my kids were to change clothes when 
they’re at school … if they were to try to trick me, they’d probably get
away with it,' she told CBS Los Angeles.

'I’ve learned to cope quite well. I can hide it from most people. But on the other side, it’s very intimidating when you don’t know your kids,' she added.

Mrs Fall developed face blindness after having surgery to try to control seizures. She suffered a stroke during the operation, which damaged the right side of the brain that deals with recognition.

'You could 
close your eyes and picture somebody close to you. Picture your mother 
or father and you could get a very vivid image in your head of what they
look like. Tara can no longer do that,' Dr Justin Feinstein said.

The clinical neuropsychologist at Caltech, added: 'For 10 years now, her idea of what she 
looks like is still that same 27-year-old woman. It hasn’t advanced.'

Tell-tale signs: Tara with her daughters. She relies on characteristics and hair styles to remember them

Before she had the surgery Mrs Fall, who had suffered from epilepsy her whole life, was so worried that she may lose her entire memory that she jotted down details about her life, her children's names and her likes and dislikes.

But while she can remember everything from before her stroke, and has a great memory for conversations and other details, after the operation she could no longer remember faces.

'It’s an intimidating world, but it’s one that I’ve learned to cope with,' she told The Gazette in Iowa.

The situation is made more difficult because her husband is in the Navy and serves overseas for long periods.

Research: Dr Justin Feinstein, a clinical neuropsychologist , and Tara Fall who lost her ability to recognize faces

Her inability to recognize someone can happen in the blink of an eye. If she was talking to a person who then looked away and removed their glasses, she would be at a loss to who was now in front of her.

'I recognize more the clues that fit the person,' Mrs Fall said, adding that she concentrates on a particular characteristic or other signs that others may miss.

And while she has managed to learn to walk again, and takes part in research groups in the hope that one day a cure will be found, for now Mrs Fall has to rely on a process of elimination to figure out who is standing in front of her.
