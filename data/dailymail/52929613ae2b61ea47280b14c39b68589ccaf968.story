Swiss midfielder Valon Behrami has joined Bundesliga side Hamburg on a three-year contract after leaving Napoli for an undisclosed fee.

The former West Ham man spent two years in Serie A, helping Rafa Benitez's side lift the Coppa Italia last season.

He will now link up with the German side as manager Mirko Slomka looks to improve upon the club's dismal 2013/14 campaign, in which they narrowly avoided relegation.

Beharami told Hamburg's official website: 'I already feel very good and am satisfied.

'Hamburg is a new experience for me and a great club. It is a very important moment in my career.

'After the World Cup I had about three weeks of vacation, so I've trained just seven days with the team.

'I must begin work on my fitness, but I'm here now. I need a little more time, but we have that time, so that is OK.'

The 29-year-old joined the Hammers from Lazio in 2008 before moving to Italian side Fiorentina three years later.
