Warning: Boris Johnson said police and social services are often too hampered by political correctness to act

The children of Islamist radicals should be taken into care, Boris Johnson said last night.

The Mayor of London said hundreds of children were at risk of being turned into fanatics by extremist parents.

But he warned that in many cases social services and the police are simply too influenced by ‘absurd’ political correctness to take them into care.

Mr Johnson said young people were increasingly being ‘radicalised at their home’ and taught the sort of ‘crazy stuff’ similar to the views espoused by the killers of Lee Rigby.

He said lack of clarity about the law meant the authorities were reluctant to intervene.

The Mayor wrote in the Daily Telegraph: ‘A child may be taken into care if he or she is being exposed to pornography, or is being abused – but not if the child is being habituated to this utterly bleak and nihilistic view of the world that could lead them to become murderers.

‘It is the strong view of many of those involved in counter-terrorism that there should be a clearer legal position, so that those children who are being turned into potential killers or suicide bombers can be removed into care.’

The Mayor drew parallels about the way in which political correctness hampered action by citing the Daily Mail’s revelations about senior Labour politicians, the National Council for Civil Liberties and its affiliation with a paedophile organisation.

He said: ‘Look at the case of Harriet Harman. You may ask yourself how on earth this relatively astute politician could have allowed her organisation to be affiliated to a body that brazenly called itself the “Paedophile Information Exchange”.

'The answer – which Harman would do well to admit – is that back in the Seventies she got into a complete intellectual fog.’

He said many young people are being taught 'crazy stuff' like the views of Michael Adebowale and Michael Adebolajo who murdered fusilier Lee Rigby with no remorse and have since been jailed

He said the NCCL, in search of minorities to protect, came across the PIE and ‘mushily decided’ the group must have protected status.

Mr Johnson said there were thousands of counter-terrorism officers working doing a ‘fantastic job’ to keep the public safe. They had to work out which vulnerable young people were most at risk of radicalisation.

The Mayor wrote: ‘That will sometimes mean taking a view about what is happening to them in their homes – and I worry that their work is being hampered by what I am obliged to call political correctness.’
