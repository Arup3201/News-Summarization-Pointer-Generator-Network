A former Republican congressional candidate who owes his mini-stardom to a chance encounter with Barack Obama during his first presidential campaign wrote in an open letter to shooting victims' families that their grief can't override the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

I am sorry you lost your child, wrote Samuel Wurzelbacher, known in conservative circles as Joe the Plumber. 'I myself have a son and daughter and the one thing I never want to go through, is what you are going through now.'

'But: As harsh as this sounds – your dead kids don't trump my Constitutional rights.'

His harsh words came a day after Richard Martinez, whose so Christopher was gunned down Friday night by mass-killer Elliot Rodger, blamed the National Rifle Association and 'craven, irresponsible politicians' for his son's death.

Craving attention? Samuel 'Joe the Plumber' Wurzelbacher (R) campaigned alongside vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin in 2008 and faded from public view after Barack Obama won the White House

Roar: Richard Martinez, the father of  mass-shooting victim Christopher Martinez, angrily denounced the National Rifle Association for his son's death, along with 'craven, irresponsible politicians' who refuse to change gun laws

Christopher Martinez, 20, was killed in Friday's shooting rampage at the I.V. Deli Mart in Isla Vista, California when deranged gunman Elliot Rodger open fire

Rodger went on a stabbing-and-shooting spree near the University of California, Santa Barbara.

Wurzelbacher became a Republican mascot when Obama answered his question about bisuness tax increases on a rope line in 2008, saying that 'when you spread the wealth around, it’s good for everybody.'

He published his open letter at BarbWire, a conservative blog.

Martinez, he wrote, 'can say whatever he wants and blame whoever he'd like – it's okay by me.'

'You can't take a step in his shoes – at least I can't.'

'But the words and images of Mr. Martinez blaming 'the proliferation of guns,' lobbyists, politicians, etc.; will be exploited by gun-grab extremists,' he argued, 'as are all tragedies involving gun violence and the mentally ill by the anti-Second Amendment Left.'

He insisted that he will 'continue to speak out' for his right to own a gun, 'and against those who would restrict it – even in the face of this horrible incident by this sad and insane individual.'

'I almost said "Obama Voter," Wurzelbacher added, referring to the gunman, 'but I'm waiting for it to be official.'

Rodger stabbed three of his six victims to death, but the conservative activist was quick to point out that he was speaking 'only to the families of the gunshot victims.'

The Ohio handshake that launched a cult celebrity: Then-Senator Barack Obama sparred with Wurzelbacherin 2008 over tax policy, famously saying that 'when you spread the wealth around, it's good for everybody'

Makeshift memorials have spring up near Santa Barbara, California, including this one dedicated to Christopher Martinez, a UCSB student

UCSB graduate student Jeb Sprague held a gun-control sign on Friday after the killings, but before Richard Martinez blamed the mass shooting on the NRA and America's gun culture

And addressing Martinez, he sniped: 'Any feelings you have toward my rights being taken away from me, lose those.'

Martinez has seemed laser-focused on gun control since his son was tragically murdered.

He told The Washington Post on Tuesday that he's tired of politicians calling him with condolences but without a plan to prevent the next gun massacre.

'I don't care about your sympathy,' he said he tells them. 'I don't give a s*** that you feel sorry for me.'

And with tears rolling, he told the Post what he demands of them.

'Get to work and do something. I'll tell the president the same thing if he calls me. Getting a call from a politician doesn't impress me.'
