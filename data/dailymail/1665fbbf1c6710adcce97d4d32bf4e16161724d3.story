A thief who robbed an ice cream parlour was jailed after
police found a bag of stolen Quavers in his pocket.

Jordan Pyke, 20, was arrested after police found the
packet of curly cheese-flavoured crisps in his pocket while investigating the
raid at Frederick’s ice cream parlour at Mesnes Park in Wigan, Greater
Manchester.

Officers matched the serial number on the crisp packet to
the box he plundered from them during the theft in December last year and arrested him and two
others.

Pyke, of Wigan, was jointly charged with the two other men but while they pleaded guilty, he denied any involvement.

He claimed the crisps had been given to him by the others
when he met up with them later and hadn’t asked where they were from.

However, he was found guilty following a trial at Wigan and
Leigh Magistrates’ Court and sentenced to 18 weeks in a young offenders’
institution.

Prosecutor Mike Ardern told the hearing how the ice cream
parlour manager had been called last December after the alarm was triggered.

Officers found the intruders had forced and damaged two
windows to get inside of the expensively-restored building.

Papers had been thrown around, a cash float stolen and boxes
of crisps had been opened and partially emptied.

Police, who were already investigating reports of another
disturbance in the area, found the three men acting suspiciously nearby and
detained them on suspicion of theft.

Mr Ardern said: ‘Officers searched all three men and found
that they had particular packets of fried potato snacks - Quavers - in their
pockets that matched those taken.

‘They gave contradictory accounts of how they came by the
snacks and all three were detained.’

At the sentencing hearing this week, Pyke admitted having a bladed
instrument in a public place after police found a kitchen knife in his hoodie
alongside the Quavers.

Bob Toppin, defending, urged the court to impose a suspended
sentence for the ‘very unsophisticated burglary’.

He said the knife was in Pyke’s pocket because he had been
cutting cooked chicken to eat earlier in the evening.

He said: ‘He made no attempt to brandish the knife, nobody
was threatened and he had no intention of using it.’

Pyke was sentenced to a total of 18 weeks in a young
offenders’ institution for the burglary, possessing the knife and non-payment
of previous court fines.

The court waived a £500 outstanding compensation order owed
to his mother after she signalled her agreement to the bench and made no order
for costs.
