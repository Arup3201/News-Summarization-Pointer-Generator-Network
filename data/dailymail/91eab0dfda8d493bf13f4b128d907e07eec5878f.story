There are no doubt many people who are better qualified than Larry Lamb to present a programme on the rise of the Roman Empire but you can see why Channel 5 producers chose the former Eastenders star to front their latest venture: his enthusiasm is infectious, and his name is likely to get people tuning in to catch the actor’s take on this fascinating period of history. 

Plus, the subject matter is a soap writer’s dream: there is political backstabbing, kidnapping and murder from the off.

The four-part series Rome: The World’s First Superpower sees the Gavin and Stacey star chart the rise of the city from a collection of mud huts to a republic and a mighty empire spanning from Britain to the Middle East.

Seeing the sights: A trip to Rome wouldn't be complete without a visit to the famous  Colosseum

Bringing history to life: The Roman Forum was the site of some of ancient Rome's most important buildings

Lamb is a self-confessed Roman history geek (at one point he tells viewers ‘I feel like a kid at Christmas’) and jumped at the chance to present the programme: ‘They wanted the person that presented this story to do it from the point of view of an interested history buff rather than an expert’, he explains.

‘What we’re doing is opening up the story in a way that people can understand the way it all came about. It’s the story of the birth of a superpower - it’s all about how a bunch of Bronze Age people living in little huts eventually finished up creating a civilisation the echoes of which have lasted for two and a half thousand years.’

The series opens with Rome’s 2,767th birthday celebrations in April. Gladiators, centurions, senators and Vestal Virgins stream past the camera during the procession which this year coincided with Easter: a time when thousands of people flood into the city.

‘Rome’s birthday is on a certain date whereas Easter can change by as much as a month’, Lamb explains.

‘We had to deal with an incredible number of tourists. Unless you are a Catholic and you want to go there with hundreds of thousands of people, I would really avoid Easter time. You’re going to be there with thousands of tourists anyway, but when you go there [at Easter], you’re going to have double the amount of tourists. They flock in from all over Italy.’

The parade, he says, is wonderful but warns: ‘If it’s colliding with Easter, I’d leave it to the next year.’

Big draw: Rome’s birthday procession includes gladiators, centurions, senators and Vestal Virgins

Keen student: Lamb also visited The British School at Rome to find out more about the Republic

Lamb plays the role of interested history student, frequently consulting a little red book that he carries around in his satchel, which contains Roman historian Livy’s account of the birth of Rome, written 700 years after the event. The finer points are explained with the help of leading historians and the archaeological sites are brought to life with the use of CGI.

At Circus Maximus, Larry reveals more about Romulus and Remus’s deadly struggle to create a city, and discovers what the earliest settling would have looked like. He then jumps forward a couple of hundred years at the Capitoline Museum to explain how Tarquin the Proud, Rome’s seventh king, was ousted and the Republic was born.

There is also a rare opportunity to descend into Rome’s claustrophobic ancient sewer network, parts of which date back to the 6th century BC and are still in use today. This elicits further ‘kid at Christmas time’ enthusiasm from Lamb but he reminds viewers that the complex network of tunnels was built at a terrible cost: enemy soldiers captured on the battlefield were forced to work as slaves on the construction. Many died and some even committed suicide rather than continue to work on the project.

The sewers are, of course, not on the tourist map and Lamb is aware how privileged he was: ‘I spoke to a lot of archaeologists who were really jealous of the fact that I’d been down there.’

Famous ruins: Larry visited Pompeii to find out more about the divide between patricians and plebeians

Travelling with a camera crew opens lots of doors but Larry could not escape Italy’s infamous red tape and had to be accompanied by professional guides at all times: ‘Filming anything in Rome is a big earner for the city and you have got to have permits for everything’, he explains. ‘If you get out of that van with a camera there will be a policeman asking where your permit is. So you need a professional ‘fixer’ to ensure you can do what you need to do.’

The money raised contributes to the cost of maintaining the archaeological sites that Lamb visited, many of which are ‘kind of just left hanging there’: ‘They are desperate to get money for companies like Channel 5 to film there because it helps them to put money in the kitty to open up more stuff. 

'And, not only that, all these things that have been exposed have got to be maintained and it costs a fortune to keep these sites safe and out of danger of being ruined by the weather.’

Wave of democracy: Larry found people in Tunisia to be 'much cooler' since the revolution

Later episodes will see Lamb travel to Jersey, where 70,000 Roman coins were found in a farmer’s field, and to Sicily and Tunisia where the Romans fought the Carthaginians and general Hannibal.

Lamb last visited Tunisia in 2004 but says he felt much more relaxed on his return: ‘Since they had their revolution there it is a lot nicer place to be’, he explains. ‘People are much cooler. They’ve had this extraordinary wave of democracy. There are still a lot of police on the streets but you feel a lot more at ease walking around in Tunis now.’

The actor also got to film in parts of France that he’d never visited before, including Dijon which he found to be a ‘glorious, glorious city’. And heading to some of Italy’s more provincial cities helped him to see another side to the country: ‘I often say to people, if you’re coming to Britain, London is an extraordinary city but if you want to get a real taste of Britain you’re actually much better off going to a provincial city like Bristol, for example. So we went off to those sort of equivalent places: Bologna, Cremona, Rimini, Pompeii.

‘It’s going to those places and staying in funny little hotels - nothing fancy - that gives you a real taste of what the country is like. Not being on the tourist trail as it were. That was the great thing about it - we were going to places where there weren't any tourists and I think that’s what people don’t do enough. I think people are a little bit lacking on the sense of adventure.’

Setting the stage: The ruins of a Roman theatre in the old harbour city of Ostia, just outside of Rome

But Rome remains a big draw for Lamb - he tries to visit at least once a year – and he says the series has shown him the city in a ‘way I only ever dreamed of’. His tip for visitors is to explore on foot: ‘I love to walk around some of the little old quarters, tiny little winding roads and back ways where you get a sense that you are in an ancient city. And I could walk along the river for hours.’

He also recommends visiting the National Roman Museum, near Termini station, which houses one of the world’s most important collections of Classical art and is often overlooked by tourists.

Those who want to explore a little further should take a train or a bus to the old harbour city of Ostia: ‘It’s incredible out there - the ruins are amazing. You can wander around for hours and there are not so many tourists.’

And does he now feel that he has covered everything The Eternal City has to offer? ‘No, there’s too much too see. I want to go back to Rome in the winter time. My Roman friends moan about it being too cold but I’ve been to the south in the winter time where they moan about it being too cold and for me it’s like a summer’s day. People are walking along the beach thinking: ‘There’s a mad person in the sea!’’

Rome: The World’s First Superpower is on Fridays at 8pm on Channel 5
