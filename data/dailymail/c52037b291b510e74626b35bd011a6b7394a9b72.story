A protein that holds one of the secrets to creating life has been discovered by scientists in Britain giving hope to childless couples

A protein that holds one of the secrets to creating life has been discovered by British scientists.

The breakthrough brings hope of better treatment for childless women and could also help in the development of contraceptives.

The protein, given the name Juno after the Roman goddess of marriage and fertility, is thought to be studded on the surface of human eggs.

It is essential for fertility as it ‘mates’ with a partner protein on the sperm at the moment of conception.

Juno holds the key to fertility – without it the sperm and egg cannot fuse to create new life.

Researcher Gavin Wright, of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute near Cambridge, said: ‘We have solved a long-standing mystery in biology by identifying the molecules displayed on all sperm and eggs that must bind to each other at the moment we were conceived.

‘Without this essential interaction, fertilisation just cannot happen. We may be able to use this discovery to improve fertility treatments and develop new contraceptives.’

Since 2005, when an essential protein was found on the head of sperm, the search has been on for its female counterpart.

The Sanger Institute team created an artificial version of the sperm protein – called Izumo, after a marriage shrine in Japan – and  used it to hunt out its egg version. On finding Juno, they did a series of tests on mice that proved it to be necessary for fertilisation.

Importantly, mice that were unable to make Juno seemed perfectly healthy but were infertile.

Although they made eggs, sperm were unable to bind to them, the journal Nature reports. The experiments also revealed that Juno is quickly removed from the surface of an egg after fertilisation occurs.

This ensures only one sperm binds with the egg and increases the odds of a successful pregnancy. It is thought that a similar protein is found on women’s eggs – and that flaws in it could explain why some couples cannot have children.

If this is the case, women found to have a faulty Juno protein could be treated with ICSI, a special type of IVF in which the sperm is injected directly into the egg.

This would bypass the flawed Juno 
protein. Dr Wright said: ‘If this Juno protein is missing in infertile 
women, what we can do is perform a very simple genetic screen test that 
isn’t invasive.

‘This would allow is to guide the fertility treatment so that women can proceed directly to ICSI.

‘And that would save the trauma and expense of going through rounds of fertility treatment.

‘By identifying this interaction between Juno and Izumo, we now know the identity of the proteins  found on the surface of our father’s sperm and our mother’s egg that must interact at the moment at which we were conceived – the moment we were made.’

Researcher Dr Erin Bianchi said: ‘Infertility is becoming an increasing problem, especially in Western countries, and it is remarkable that 20 per cent of infertility cases have an unexplained cause.

‘We are now testing whether Juno is involved in these cases.’

Dr Allan Pacey, a Sheffield University fertility expert, said: ‘The identification of the Juno protein opens up many exciting prospects. Perhaps the most obvious  biomedical application of this  finding is whether screening for this protein could be used as a test of fertility.’

The discovery could also lead to new types of contraceptive not be based on hormones – and thus free from the unwelcome side-effects of existing drugs.
