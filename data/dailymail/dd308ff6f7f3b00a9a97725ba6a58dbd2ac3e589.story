A Chicago felon with a lengthy rap sheet faces hate crime and murder charges after he allegedly harassed an African-American man and his daughter before beating the man to death earlier this week.

Michael Tingling, 58, was walking his 15-year-old daughter, Masharah, home from school - as he often did - when the two were approached by 59-year-old Joseph Firek in the 7100-block of North Clark Street in Chicago on Wednesday afternoon.

Firek, prosecutors say, brushed up against Mashara as they passed each other in their Rogers Park neighborhood, where Michael Tingling - a former boxer - was a well-liked, respected member of the community.

Felon: 59-year-old Joseph Firek has a lengthy criminal record and was out on parole when he attacked Tingling

'[Firek] was staring at me up and down, eyeballing me and everything....and 
then my dad, being a father, he got protective and put me behind 
him...he told the guy to go away,' Masharah told WLS.

As Tingling was attempting to protect his daughter, Firek allegedly pushed him and began yelling racial slurs.

'The defendant looked at the victim and said, "What's up n******." The 
victim pulled his daughter behind him," Cook County Assistant State's 
Attorney Glendon Runk said in court.

Firek, authorities say, then started punching Tingling - who suffered from diabetes and heart problems - in the chest before he and his daughter were able to escape to a nearby store and call police.

But Firek followed them - and Tingling collapsed.

'[Firek was] like, "I hope he's okay, I hope I didn't kill him." And he's 
telling me to calm down. I told him you have no right to tell me to calm
 down...because that's my dad,' Masharah said.

Tingling, who had a pacemaker to treat his heart condition, was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital shortly after the altercation.

His death was ruled a homicide.

Firek, who was on parole following one of many burglary convictions, suffers from mental illness, his public defender argued, and received outpatient care at a nearby psychiatric center. 

Firek's been charged with first-degree murder as a hate crime and is being held on a $250,000 bond.

Masharah Tingling, meanwhile, is without a father.

'I want my Dad back. I really want my Daddy,' she said.

'That man took my dad away from me...and now my dad can't see me go to 
8th grade graduation...and that's all he ever wanted to do was see me 
graduate,' Masharah continued.
