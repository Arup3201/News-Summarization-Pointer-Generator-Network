It's been a difficult year for Paulinho. A poor first season at Tottenham was followed by a dismal World Cup showing as his Brazil side ended their home tournament in disgrace.

But there have been signs this season, and particularly on Thursday night, that the Brazilian may be beginning to turn things around.  

The midfielder scored one goal and made another as Tottenham easily beat AEL Limassol to qualify for the Europa League. 

Here is Sportsmail's verdict on the performances of the players: 

Making sure: Paulinho slides home Spurs' second goal, ending the tie as a contest

Hugo Lloris - Had very little to do but was on hand when needed - 7

Kyle Naughton - Good forward running which led to Tottenham's early penalty - 7.5 

Big blow: Kyle Naughton collides with Karim Fegrouche in the AEL goal to win Tottenham a penalty

Arrival: Harry Kane's penalty was saved by Puplo Romero with his very first touch of the game

Vlad Chiriches - Solid and dependable performance but didn't have too much to do - 7

Younes Kaboul - An assured performance from the back, the Frenchman was always looking to give the ball to the midfield to start the next attack - 7

Ben Davies - Settling in well at hisnew club and could have made it four late on with rasping drive which was well saved - 7

Strong: Mousa Dembele dominated the centre of the park as Spurs looked comfortable throughout

Mousa Dembele - Kept possession well and was always looking to receive the ball from team-mates - 7

Sandro - Knitted together much of Tottenham's good play and worked well alongside fellow Brazilian Paulinho - 7.5

Paulinho - Some lovely touches and was on hand to slide the ball through to Harry Kane for the opener before doubling Tottenham's advantage himself - 8 

Hard work: Paulinho looked good going forward but also did his fair share of work defensively

Aaron Lennon - Went close to scoring a delightful chip early in the second half and put in a good shift for his side - 7

Andros Townsend - Coursed problems down the wing and didn't stop running. Finished penalty with aplomb. 7.5 

Three-sy does it: Andros Townsend celebrates scoring Tottenham's third goal from the penalty spot

Harry Kane - Lead the line well and redeemed his penalty miss with a well-taken goal - 7.5 

Relentless: Despite his early penalty miss Harry Kane recovered to score the first goal of the night
