Manchester City have turned down the chance to sign Angel Di Maria twice in the past year, with the most recent opportunity arriving earlier this month.

The Real Madrid winger is on the brink of joining Manchester United in a deal that could be worth in excess of £60 million, a figure that will shatter the British transfer record.

It is understood that the Argentina player has been offered to United’s rivals in both of the last two transfer windows.

Surplus to requirements: Manchester City were offered Angel Di Maria in the past two transfer windows

It has been known for some time that Di Maria may be surplus to requirements in Madrid following the signing of James Rodriguez.

City, however, have not been interested in pursuing a move over the last year and a well-placed source told Sportsmail that the club were ‘never in for him’ this summer.

They are also attempting to remain within the restrictions of UEFA’s Financial Fair Play restrictions and such a deal may have negated City’s capacity to recruit in defence and midfield, which was felt to be a priority.

They decided they did not need to strengthen in the forward positions in this window and declined the chance to sign the World Cup finalist.

United are expected to complete the deal in the coming week and Di Maria will be offered the No 7 shirt, famously worn in the past by Cristiano Ronaldo and David Beckham, at Old Trafford.
