A convenience store worker who pulled a gun on a robber has now been fired from his job at 7-Eleven .

Robert VanConett was behind the front desk at a 7-ElevenÂ  in St Petersburg, Florida in the middle of a night shift when his colleague was behind the cash register helping a customer pay.

Once the register was opened, the customer threw a cup of hot water on VanConett's colleague and started taking the cash from inside the drawer.

Setting the scene: This unidentified man approached the checkout counter on October 12 with coffee

Ready to strike: The man took his hot coffee and threw it at the store clerk that was serving him, and Robert VanConett is seen to the left of his colleague

Going for it: The worker hunches over in pain after being scalded and the man grabs for the cash

After the other worker ran back because of the coffee, VanConett came back up to the register and held out a gun.

'I just wanted to get him out of the store and it worked,' VanConett told local station WTSP.

He has a license to carry the concealed weapon, but that didn't stop him from getting in trouble with his bosses.

The robber, who has not been identified, did not have a gun on him but did have a knife.

7-Eleven has a company-wide rule that 
employees are not allowed to bring guns to work, meaning that VanConett 
was fired in spite of the fact that he never fired the weapon.

'I'd
do it again. It was just the simple fact I'm not going to sit there and
get stabbed or get cut or anything like that. The guy looked like he 
was on drugs or something,' he told WTSP.

'The guy looked like he was on drugs or something,' VanConett said

Backing off: VanConett said that he took out the gun to get the robber to leave, which he did

Unharmed: VonConett never actually fired the weapon but he was still fired in return

VanConett had worked at 7-Eleven for six years prior to the October 12 incident.

The quiet night shifts are targeted by some criminals, and VanConett had reason to be concerned as a store clerk at a 7-Eleven in Riverview was stabbed to death in July.

'You don't want to pull it out or shoot anybody, but you don't want to be sitting in there if they start shooting and have nothing,' VanConett said, urging the company to change their policy for worker safety.
