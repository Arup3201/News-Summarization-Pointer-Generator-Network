It is a forecast which will have the country wishing it was a Bank Holiday weekend.

Monday is set to be the hottest day of the year so far, with temperatures warming up over the next couple of days.

Parts of the country will see the mercury reach as high as 32c (90f) at the start of the working week.

Despite the good news, sun worshippers would be wise to make the most of it, because this is not the start of a glorious summer.

More a heat ripple than a heat wave, cooler temperatures are due to return as quickly as  the middle of the week, forecasters said.

Today is due to start off a little damp and drizzly across the country, but the weather  will warm up in most parts with maximum temperatures of around 25c (77f).

Tomorrow will be warmer still, hitting 30c (86f) in the South-East, and on Monday Mother Nature will turn up the dial to a 32c maximum.

The sun should allow for a good day of tennis at Wimbledon today and, after an extremely soggy start, thousands of mud-addled revellers at Glastonbury can finally look forward to their moment in the sun.

A Met Office forecaster said yesterday: ‘Most parts of the UK will see some decent weather this weekend.

'It will feel warm, particularly in the South, and on Monday we are expecting the hottest day of the year so far.

‘But it looks like things will be getting cooler as we get further into next week.’

The blast of sunshine might not be 
welcomed by many farmers, after the Environment Agency stated that the 
current drought is still not over, despite many parts of England and 
Wales already receiving higher than average rainfall for June

The forecast has also prompted a heat-health alert for the East Midlands, East of England and the South-East, warning of the dangers of high temperatures, particularly for the very old, the very young and those with chronic health conditions.

Chief forecaster at the Met Office Andy Page  said: ‘There is a 60 per cent chance of some places in East Anglia, the East Midlands and south-east England reaching 30c on Sunday and Monday.’

Its head of health forecasting said: ‘There is the possibility of daytime and night-time temperatures reaching trigger thresholds.

‘These temperatures, together with high humidity, pose a risk to vulnerable people.’

Lincolnshire, Cambridgeshire, parts of Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire and western Norfolk remain in a state of drought.

Many rivers are below normal levels for this time of year, including the Dove and Derwent in Central England, Ely and Ouse in East Anglia, and the Kennet and Coln in the Thames Valley.

Trevor Bishop, head of water resources at the Environment Agency, urged people to continue to use water wisely.

He said: ‘The wetter weather has 
helped this week. However, without further sustained rainfall, river 
flows will quickly drop again.’
