People in Glasgow are among the most unhelpful in Britain, according to a unique experiment which tested how many individuals carry out good deeds across the UK.

As part of the unique test, 850 tagged keys were dropped in 15 cities across the country and researchers measured how many ended up at their ‘owner's’ destination.

Oxford and Cambridge proved to be the most trustworthy cities in Britain, with eight out of 10 keys (80 per cent) being returned to their rightful ‘owner’.

Glasgow was found to be the least altruistic city in the UK, with only one in three keys (34 per cent) being returned to their 'owner' in the study, which was carried out by lost property retrieval service Keyfetch.com

However, Glasgow and Newcastle proved to be the least altruistic with only one in three keys turning up again.

Online lost property retrieval service Keyfetch.com carried out the National Altruism Study (NAS) and a survey in which it quizzed 2,000 people about their altruism.

In the survey, an overwhelming nine out of ten Brits said they would return a missing set of keys if they had a way to notify the owner (90 per cent).

But the findings from the key-drop experiment revealed just six in 10 people (59 per cent) actually did when given the chance.

Newcastle - 4 minutes

Edinburgh - 5 minutes

Leeds - 6 minutes

Cambridge - 6 minutes

More than one in three people said keys were more valuable than wallets, laptops or even a mobile phone (37 per cent).

The experiment, which dropped between 50 and 100 keys in each of the 15 cities, found that six out of 10 keys which were returned were reunited with their owner within 24 hours (60 per cent).

Overall, the average return time was six hours.

One resident in Newcastle alerted the owner of the missing key within a speedy four minutes of the item being lost.

People in Oxford were quicker to alert owners than their Cambridge rivals, typically beating them by seven and a half hours.

Cambridge topped Oxford's fastest return time of 36 minutes by half an hour to score equal fourth quickest in the country.

Dr Brendan Burchell, head of sociology at University of Cambridge, said busy modern life sometimes gets in the way of ethics.

Dr Burchell said: ‘The fast-paced nature of modern life means that, even when we know it would be ethical to act in a certain way, our best intentions are not acted upon.

Cambridge - 80 per cent

Belfast - 80 per cent

Oxford - 80 per cent

Brighton - 74 per cent

Bristol - 74 per cent

London - 68 per cent

Edinburgh - 60 per cent

Leeds - 59 per cent

Manchester - 56 per cent

Plymouth - 54 per cent

Birmingham - 46 per cent

Liverpool - 44 per cent

Cardiff - 40 per cent

Newcastle - 38 per cent

Glasgow - 34 per cent

‘The National Altruism Study shows that when we make it easy for people to be ethical, then a high proportion show acts of kindness to complete strangers.

‘If it is made easy to return keys without, for instance, having to make a time-consuming trip to a lost-property office or a police station then a high proportion of people act with empathy and compassion.’

Young people are most likely to lose their valuables, with 70 per cent having lost their keys at least once, the study found.

Dr Burchell added: ‘Keyfetch's National Altruism Study highlights a number of important societal issues.

‘Sociologists have found that countries and cities differ in what we call 'Social Capital', or norms of trust and reciprocity between people.

‘Returning keys, a simple act of kindness, is an expression of a social capital.

‘Those cities where the lost keys had higher rates of being returned are probably the cities where people model small acts of kindness, courtesy and respect to each other on a daily basis.

‘The study's findings suggest Social Capital is stronger in the cities of Cambridge, Oxford and Belfast.’

John Candillier, co-founder of Keyfetch.com, said: ‘We know that people are intrinsically good.

‘The National Altruism Study gave the United Kingdom the opportunity to prove just that.

‘When polled, more than half of the nation admit having lost their keys.

‘Fuelled by the goodwill of others, Keyfetch makes this unfortunate situation less stressful and costly.

‘Altruism is the heartbeat of society, it unites people and makes them a community.'
