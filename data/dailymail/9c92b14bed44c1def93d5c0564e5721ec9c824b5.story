Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge says Luis Suarez's £75million exit means the remaining players have to step up a level if they want to kick on in the Premier League and the Champions League.

Sturridge, who returns for pre season training this week, is now the club's most senior striker, despite joining just 18 months ago from Chelsea.

And the England forward, who scored against Italy at the World Cup, feels those who played alongside Suarez last season will have to work hard to fill the void left by his former controversial striker partner.

'People have to step up,' Sturridge said. 'When stars leave, a new star can be born, as they say.

'There are a lot of players that can take that mantle, but it is a team game, regardless of whether there are star players within that team. It’s not about one person, it’s about the team.'

And Sturridge believes 19-year-old playmaker Raheem Sterling can be the man to make up for the loss of quality left by Suarez.

Sterling starred as Liverpool looked set to pick up their first league title in 24 years before bad results against Chelsea and Crystal Palace derailed their bid and handed Manchester City the Premier League trophy.

'Me and Raheem are very close,' Sturridge told Jamaica's Nationwide Radio. 'To me, he's my little brother and I look after him and try to help him as a footballer and as a person.

'I didn't have anyone take me under their wing when I was his age, so it is important now that I understand my role, which is the big brother role. I guide him where I can, and that's as important as being his friend and his team-mate.

'It's going to be great. Raheem is a great player. He's young, but he's got a lot of talent, and talent that sometimes people don't get to see as well.

'He's young and he is still improving. He's already improved so much, which I am happy about, and he will continue to do that.'
