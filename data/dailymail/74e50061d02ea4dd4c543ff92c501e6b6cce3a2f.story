Two strangers committed suicide by jumping off the George Washington Bridge in separate incidents that were just seconds apart.

One victim leapt off the upper level just 75 yards from the other on the lower level, police said.

He was spotted in a Toyota Sienna minivan on the bridge around 4.20pm yesterday.

The other used a bicycle to get to the centre. Both men left suicide notes.

It is believed the man with the minivan had been prevented from doing the same thing just two weeks ago by a quick-thinking police officer.

Jesse Turana had to grab on to the 37-year-old's clothes to stop him falling on February 17. 

He said at the time: 'I wasn't going to let him go - I wasn't going to let him die while I was out there.'  

A Port Authority spokesman said the two incidents yesterday were unrelated.

'They were both literally within seconds of each other,' he told the New York Post.

Both bodies have now been recovered from the Hudson River.

Sources said one of the men is believed to have tried to jump to his death two weeks ago – but was saved by a quick-thinking cop
