Dozens of MPs are boosting their taxpayer-funded salaries by tens of thousands of pounds by taking second jobs.

The new analysis found that as well as drawing their MPs salary of £65,738, many are juggling their political work with jobs in careers such as law, consulting and business and making up to 13 times their annual pay.

In some cases, MPs are spending up to 20 hours a week working outside Westminster raising questions about their ability to serve their constituents properly.

The Times examined the annual earnings of all MPs declared on the register of members’ interests as well as the numbers of hours worked by each.

Extras: Dozens of MPs have been found to be earning tens of thousands more by having second jobs

It found that 68 MPs now make more than £10,000 a year each from outside earning - making over £6million between them. A total of 18 MPs earned more than £100,000.

MPs must declare more details of their outside earnings from today under new rules in 2009 as part of the previous Government’s bid to ‘clean up’ politics in the wake of the expenses scandal.

They are now required to reveal how much they earn from other jobs, how many hours they worked for it and who paid them - even if the work does not relate to their political role.

Previously, they only had to name their outside employers and directorships in the Register of Members’ Interests, and give an indication of how much they were paid if the work was related to their job as an MP.

Following the expenses scandal, few MPs ratcheted up more than a few thousand pounds outside Parliament. But the analysis found that six-figure sums have now become more commonplace.

Many of the MPs made a robust defence of their work insisting that their experience of the real world makes them better politicians. Others insisted that it meant that they were more confident of speaking their minds without fear of losing their jobs.

Senior figures on the list include the former Prime Minister Gordon Brown who has registered earnings of more than £900,000 from speeches, academic posts and policy work. However, Mr Brown does not personally gain from any of the money.

It instead goes towards the running costs of the Office of Gordon and Sarah Brown, which has donated over £500,000 to charity. Neither Mr Brown or his wife receive any salary, dividends or profits from the office.

Another big hitter with high outside earnings includes the former Foreign Secretary David Miliband, who earns over £410,000, from consultancy work and speeches.

Tory MP Tim Yeo reaped nearly £212,000 for working an average of 51 hours per month. Mr Yeo is facing calls to quit as chairman of the Commons environment and climate change committee after it emerged nearly £140,000 a year comes from green companies.

The former environment minister is facing a threat from colleagues to depose him from the chairmanship due to his outside interests.

Activists and MPs have said that he should be forced to choose between his leadership of the powerful select committee and his other jobs.

But barrister and Tory MP Geoffrey Cox, who earned more than £400,000 over 12 months, insisted: ‘I believe it enriches Parliament. It allows you first and foremost to have independence of mind. I’m not dependent on the whips because my career is outside as well as inside.

Highest paid: Prime Minister Gordon Brown, with his wife Sarah. The former PM earned £900,000 last year on top of his salary but says that he does not benefit from the cash

David Miliband has been blasted after it was revealed he received £14,000 for making a speech.

Fellow MPs say anyone who wanted to pay that much to hear the former Foreign Secretary speak had 'more money than sense'.

The Labour MP for South Shields received more than £116 a minute for a two-hour speech to a law firm at Claridge’s Hotel in London on June 14.

The payment is outlined in Mr Miliband’s declaration on the latest register of MPs’ financial interests.

He collected £441,821.60 in outside earnings since June last year on top of his £65,738 annual salary as an MP.

Labour MP Ronnie Campbell, who represents Blyth Valley, said outside earnings were wrong as it raised concerns about exactly who big-earning MPs were working for.

He said anyone who wanted to pay money for a speech had 'more money than sense'.

Mr Miliband received a total of £75,000 for 10 days work as vice-chairman and non-executive director of Sunderland football club between June 2011 and February this year.

For making speeches around the world, the South Shields MP earned £120,258, while as an adviser to several firms and organisations, he earned £185,875.60 for 12 days’ work.

Five days of teaching at America’s Stanford University last September brought in £25,027, with travel and accommodation worth £3,834 covered.

A spokesman for the South Shields MP said: 'David Miliband’s job as MP for South Shields comes first, as shown by his speeches in Parliament.'

‘The trend is regrettable towards the professionalism of politics. If you want machine politicians, by which I mean party machine, we are going in the right direction.’

Tory MP Mark Field, who earns £49,240 as an adviser, said: ‘I think it’s actually quite healthy for MPs to keep abreast with the outside world’.

Fellow Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, who earns £122,000 as a partner in an investment management firm, added: ‘If you spend too much time on outside interests that is now declared so the voters can see that. If they think you are doing your job, they can re-elect you or otherwise.’

Liberal Democrat John Hemming, who earns £150,000, said: ‘If you upset the hierarchy, you can find you lose your job as an MP.’

Tory MP and chic-lit author Louise Mensch, who recently announced she was quitting Parliament to spend more time with her family, registered earnings of nearly £76,000 from publishing fees, royalty and media work.

But campaigners questioned the nature of some of the work warning that it might ‘distract’ some MPs from serving their constituents properly.

Jonathan Isaby, Political Director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘There’s nothing wrong in principle with Members of Parliament having outside sources of income, so long as their constituents know what they are up to and feel they are getting value for money.

‘The last thing taxpayers want is a House of Commons jam-packed with career politicians without experience of the world outside Westminster.

‘However, any other jobs they do should not distract them from their primary focus of serving their communities as MPs, and if voters think they have been badly represented for whatever reason, at the moment they clearly still have the option of voting for someone else come the next election.’
