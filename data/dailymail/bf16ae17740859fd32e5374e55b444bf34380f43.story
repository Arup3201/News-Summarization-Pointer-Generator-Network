Since her starring role at her sister the Duchess of Cambridge's wedding, she's been in near constant demand.

And with her party planning business and literary career taking off Pippa Middleton appears to be taking financial matters very seriously, setting up her own registered company and has apparently hired Ant and Dec's accountants.

The 29-year-old has appointed herself the sole director of PXM Enterprises, a limited company registered at 19 Portland Place near Regents Park, a building leased by the OJK Ltd accountancy firm.

Getting serious:  Pippa Middleton at the launch of her new creative entertaining book 'Celebrate' 
at an afternoon children's party. She has now set up her first company PXM Enterprises

OJK Ltd provides 
accountancy services to clients in the music, sports and broadcast media
 industries.

The firm's other clients include singer Kate Bush, Il Divo and Andi Peters' Models, the Times reported.

It is not yet known what PXM's line of business will be, or for that matter what the X in the middle of the name stands for. 

Ms Middleton's book, Celebrate: A Year of British Festivities For Families and Friends, has been roundly panned by critics with some slamming her for cashing in on her royal connections to make money out of stating the obvious (there are tips on how to make a cup of tea).

Sideline: Pippa has also continued to work for her parent's lucrative business Party Pieces, editing its online magazine The Party Times

Backing a winner: Pippa at the Cheltenham Festival with her banker friend, Tom Kingston in March

However despite the ridicule it reportedly netted her a £400,000 advance from publisher Michael 
Joseph.

She has also continued to work for her parent's lucrative business Party Pieces, editing its online magazine The Party Times.

The website which sells 
toys, decorations and fancy-dress costumes, is currently expanding to 
the US.

However while Party Pieces is a partnership meaning it does not have to publish any financial records, PXM is a registered company so Pippa will be required to file annual accounts, giving the public a chance to see the state of her financial affairs.

In her first column in Waitrose Kitchen's April edition, the 29-year-old offered an insight into her experiences of student life at the University of Edinburgh, where she apparently spent afternoons making sushi in front of the rugby.

In her first magazine piece - entitled Pippa's Friday Night Feasts - she described 'pre-Monday melancholy' and 'feeling exhausted' on Friday evenings, suggesting she is now familiar with the trials and tribulations of the working week.
