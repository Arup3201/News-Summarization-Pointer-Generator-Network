Investigators asked the public Thursday to provide more social media images and eyewitness accounts of a fatal police shooting that has sparked a series of protests in an agricultural community in Washington state.

They also asked for patience as they seek more information about the victim, Antonio Zambrano-Montes, an unarmed Mexican man who ran from officers after reportedly throwing rocks at them.

Sgt. Ken Lattin of the nearby Kennewick Police Department said videos continue to arrive, and he asked for more contributions from people who saw the February 10 shooting at a busy Pasco intersection.

'The more information we have, the better,' said Lattin, spokesman for the special unit investigating the shooting.

Authorities also are seeking more people who saw Antonio Zambrano-Montes, 35, in the weeks before the shooting, so they can learn more about his frame of mind, Lattin said at a news conference. 

Hundreds of demonstrators have taken to the streets to protest against the police.

Residents marched and staged 'die-ins' throughout Pasco.

The 35-year-old's death was caught on a witness's cellphone being gunned down by officers at a busy intersection, sparking outrage across  the United States and Mexico. 

It is the fourth fatal shooting by police in the city in the last six months and has caused heightened tensions within the community. 

Zambrano-Montes recently spent some time in a homeless shelter, authorities said Thursday.

But investigators have been unable to interview anyone who saw him in the two weeks leading up to his death, Lattin said.

In addition, officers are seeking to learn if Zambrano-Montes had mental problems, Lattin said.

'His actions were not normal,' Lattin said. 

'It was not reasonable behavior. We want to know why.'

In response to questions about whether the special investigative team could be objective in evaluating Pasco officers' conduct, Lattin was emphatic: 'We are going to produce an impartial report. No investigators would put their careers in jeopardy for someone else.'

Reaction: Hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets of Pasco, Washington, to protest the death of Antonio Zambrano-Montes. He was shot and killed by police after allegedly throwing stones at them

That wasn't good enough for Felix Vargas, a Pasco business leader who has asked the federal government to conduct its own probe of the shooting.

'We want a separate set of investigatory eyes to come to Pasco,' Vargas said.

He said it's inappropriate for authorities from such a close jurisdiction to be investigating a case that has drawn nationwide attention.

Pasco police say Zambrano-Montes hit two officers with rocks and refused to put down other stones.

In a cellphone video from a witness, several 'pops' are audible just before Zambrano-Montes is seen running across a street, pursued by three officers. As he stops and turns around, gunshots ring out, and he falls dead.

Lattin said investigators have determined all three officers involved discharged their weapons. But he couldn't say how many bullets were fired.

He added it was unclear from the video if Zambrano-Montes had anything in his hand when he was shot.

The three officers are on paid administrative leave. None of them was wearing a body camera, Lattin said. But authorities are looking at dash cam video from patrol cars.

Investigators have interviewed about 40 people, but only a few actually saw the shooting.

Lattin also said it was not yet clear if Zambrano-Montes was in the country legally, but that it didn't matter as far as investigators were concerned.

'We treat all individuals the same regardless of any legal status that they may have had,' investigators said in a release.

The special investigations unit does not include officers from Pasco, a southeast Washington town of about 70,000. More than half of Pasco's population is Hispanic.

The killing was the fourth by Pasco police in less than a year and has led to protests. Officers were exonerated after similar investigations in the first three cases.

Critics in the latest case say the officers should have used less than lethal force to subdue Zambrano-Montes.

Franklin County Prosecutor Shawn Sant, who ultimately will decide if charges are brought against the officers, said the victim's family has requested a private autopsy. He also said witnesses who might be in the country illegally can speak with investigators without fear of being deported.

The investigation is likely to take months, and Lattin urged calm.

'We appreciate the patience of the public,' he said.

The death of Zambrano-Montes is the fourth fatal police shooting since last summer in Pasco. It has sparked protests after witnesses said he was running away when he was shot in a busy intersection.

Witness Ben Patrick told the Tri-City Herald that police fired at the man as his back was turned.

'I really thought they were just going walk up and tackle or Taser him,' he said. 'But they opened fire. His back was turned.'

Patrick's wife, Shannon, also said the man was running away. The shooting happened in front of her young children. 'He turned around to take off running and the cops just shot him,' she said.

Other witnesses heard officers give Zambrano-Montes orders to stop and drop the rock. They said the man refused to listen.

Zambrano-Montes, who was raised in Michoacan, Mexico, has lived for about a decade in Pasco, where more than half of the residents are Hispanic. He died of gunshot wounds to the torso.

Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on Friday reiterated his country's 'condemnation of the disproportionate use of lethal force' by members of the Pasco police against a Mexican citizen.

'I have directed the secretary of foreign relations to support his family so they feel the backing and support of the government of Mexico, so they don't feel alone and so there is a close monitoring of the investigation into this regrettable and outrageous occurrence,' he said at a gathering of members of the foreign diplomatic corps in Mexico City.

Zambrano-Montes was not armed with either a gun or a knife, Lattin confirmed at the news conference, but whether he had a rock in his hand when he was shot is still under investigation.

Zambrano-Montes had a run-in with Pasco police early last year, having been arrested for assault after throwing objects at officers and trying to grab an officer's pistol, court records show.

Lattin cautioned the public that the inquiry will take at least weeks and that any decision on whether to bring charges against the three officers involved will be made by the Franklin County prosecutor.

The officers are on paid administrative leave. 'Those three officers are going to have to live by their decisions,' Lattin said. 'Was it right? That will come out later on.'

Franklin County Prosecutor Shawn Sant said it was too early to speculate about what charges potentially could be brought against the officers.

The Pasco police department also is conducting an administrative investigation of the shooting and could punish the officers if they find they disobeyed department procedures of policies.

Local officials have been in contact with state and federal officials, who are observing the local criminal investigation and decide later whether any further action needs to be taken, Lattin said.

Zambrano-Montes' family's $2 million damages claim was filed by his widow and two daughters. It is a precursor to a lawsuit. The city has 60 days to respond.

The group conducting the criminal investigation was formed in 2010 to look at any officer-involved criminal cases. This is the eleventh investigation they have conducted since then, Lattin said.

In three previous fatal police shootings in Pasco, prosecutors cleared officers with the Pasco Police Department and a sheriff's deputy who was working on a regional SWAT team.

One of the three officers involved in Tuesday's shooting was a defendant in a federal civil-rights lawsuit the city settled in 2013 for $100,000, according to court records. The lawsuit claimed Pasco officers were inadequately trained in the use of force and how to respond to street confrontations.

Earlier this week, the ACLU of Washington also issued a statement, calling the incident 'very disturbing.'

The group's executive director, Kathleen Taylor said: 'Fleeing from police and not following an officer's command should not be sufficient for a person to get shot,'

She added deadly force should be used only as a last resort.
