City watchdogs are probing allegations that foreign exchange rates are being rigged by traders.

The investigation centres on claims that bank staff are making trades before processing customer orders, and also timing them to influence the setting of benchmark rates, according to a report by Bloomberg News.

The accusations are a fresh blow to financial markets already embroiled in the Libor rate-fixing scandal - which has seen Barclays and RBS handed heavy fines.

The market in natural gas faces a probe into manipulation of prices, and questions have been raised over oil and petrol prices.

The £3trillion a day foreign exchange rate market is not regulated but the big players like banks are supervised by the Financial Conduct Authority.

A spokesman for the watchdog said: 'We are looking into this but we can't comment any further at this moment'.

The Bloomberg story reports claims that bank employees have been 'front-running' client orders and rigging WM/Reuters foreign exchange rates by pushing through trades before and during 60-second windows when benchmarks are set.

Whistleblowing traders say that the alleged practices have been occurring on a daily basis for at least a decade, and have affected the value of funds and the complex financial instruments known as derivatives, according to Bloomberg.

It also quotes an industry insider who likens the foreign exchange market to 'the Wild West'.

RBS also had to stump up £390million for its part in the Libor scandal

While rates are not followed by ordinary investors directly, they are used by fund managers to calculate their holdings and index providers like FTSE Group and MSCI to track stocks and bonds.

This means their movements can affect the value of pension and savings accounts.

Barclays was hit with a £290million fine for manipulating the Libor interest rate last summer, when lurid emails were released showing how its traders boasted about their activities.

RBS also had to stump up £390million for its part in the scandal.

Meanwhile, BP and Royal Dutch Shell saw their offices raided last month as the European Commission launched an investigation into oil price fixing.

The Commission said it was concerned there has been collusion aimed at manipulating the prices of not only oil, but also petrol and biofuels.

Energy companies are also being investigated after accusations by a whistleblower that traders manipulated the wholesale gas price to boost profits, potentially pushing household bills higher.
