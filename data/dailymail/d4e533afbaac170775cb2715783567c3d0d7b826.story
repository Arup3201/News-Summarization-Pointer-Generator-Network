Tennis ace Victoria Azarenka has candidly opened up about her battle with depression following her split from music star Redfoo.

After two years and a series of engagement rumours, the 25-year-old parted ways with Redfoo in June 2014 and her career took a nosedive.

Azarenka, from Belarus in Eastern Europe, said she was left broken-hearted when she split from X Factor Australia judge Redfoo and turned to the unlikely hobby of painting to get her through the tough times, she told the New York Times.

Tennis ace Victoria Azarenka (pictured at Hozier Lane in Melbourne) has candidly opened up about her battle with depression following her split from music star Redfoo.

A foot and knee injury restricted the tennis star to only 24 matches in 2014 leading to a disaster year, both professionally and romantically. 

'I did get my heart broken; I really did. I'm over it, but it was broken. And I'm not afraid to admit that it was, but it's life,' she said. 

'I think the toughest part is to admit that you weren't O.K. Somebody asked me at one stage, 'Are you depressed?' And I said: 'Are you kidding me? I'm not depressed.' But you know what? I was. I was, but I just didn't realize it, because all these things happen, and you just don't know how to deal with emotions.'

Azarenka, who admits that she cried a lot last year, was hitting rock-bottom and was searching for a new hobby to take her mind off her troubles. With her mother being a professional painter, it was only right that she would try her hand at the brush and before she knew it she was getting compliments on her work. 

She started crying during her first painting class and threw the brush down. Using her hands, she smeared the paint across her shirt, creating what she thought was a mess.  

'I was upset, and I was lazy, and I just wiped my hands on my shirt, just everything on my shirt, on my pants. And I woke up the next day and had a meeting in this restaurant with Nike people, and I didn't feel like dressing up. I just put on that shirt and those pants, and I come into the restaurant. And the Nike people, they're like: 'Oh my God, that's a cool shirt. Where did you buy it?' ' she said.

Speaking to the Sydney Morning Herald, Azarenka said painting is all about expressing yourself and felt it was a great outlet for her at the time.

'I don't consider myself as a great painter; I just feel that art is about expressing your emotions and expressing your feelings, and music is the same way, you can see what other people are going through. If you listen to some songs, I never understood some of the lyrics, and then I was like 'oh my God, this is what I'm going through! Did you write it for me'?'

Azarenka reveals that she found a shoulder to cry on in good friend and fellow tennis star Caroline Wozniacki. Wozniacki had just been jilted by golfer Rory McIlroy when Azarenka and Redfoo called quits on their relationship and she was also feeling the strain of her personal problems.

'We were both in Monaco when her situation happened and everything with me happened, and we were just having dinner and crying on each other's shoulders.'

The young star said she has never looked at the official numbers and does not take any heed of where she ranks on the world table in tennis, despite having only made one final last year and ending her season with a loss in Tokyo.

2015 kicked off with a disappointing loss for Azarenka at the Brisbane International before a tough training week at Melbourne Park. However Azareka is set to come back fighting this year for the Australian Open in January.
