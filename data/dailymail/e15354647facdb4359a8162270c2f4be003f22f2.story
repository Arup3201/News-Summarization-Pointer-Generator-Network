The Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago welcomed a yet to be named baby gorilla this week that will be on view for visitors on Saturday.

The newborn will join six other gorillas including her 2-year-old half-sisters Nayembi and Patty, born at the zoo in fall 2012.

The baby does not yet have a name but the zoo is taking suggestions from donors.

She will also be on view with her dad Kwan, a 25-year-old silverback and her 27-year-old mom Bahati in the zoo's Regenstein Center for African Apes, reports The Chicago Tribune.

The zoo said they are being 'cautiously optimistic' about the baby's health.

New addition: Mom Bahati holds her newborn western lowland gorilla baby at the Lincoln Park Zoo

'The infant is looking very strong; it's clinging tightly to mom, and we're seeing a really good pattern of nursing for several minutes from both breasts then taking a nap afterward,' said Maureen Leahy, curator of primates to The Chicago Tribune.

The Zoo explains that the baby is completely dependent on her mom and dad for the time being.

'At this stage, although the infant can cling on and sort of support herself, she can't do it for very long,' Leahy said.

'Mom will hold her close and tight to her chest even when she's out and about or climbing. We look for her to support the baby's head, very much like humans.'

Nourishment: The as yet unnamed infant was born on February 24 and appears to be doing well

Kwan is keeping a watchful eye on the baby to ensure that she stays out of harm's way.

Zoo workers watched the child 24/7 for 72 hours after she was born on February 24.

The baby was peeing and pooping normally which means that she was being fed adequately by her mother's breast milk.

'He is doing a really good job keeping a watchful eye over the new mom and infant,' Leahy said.

'The two toddlers are very curious; they've been approaching a lot and touching the infant, but when they start getting too bold, Kwan will come over and sit down next to Bahati and kind of cue the toddlers to take a step back and give the new mom a break.'

Bahati last gave birth in in 2004. Her two children are now adults and live in other Association of Zoos and Aquariums accredited zoos.

Western lowland gorillas are endangered in central Africa because of their loss of habitat and poaching.

The Ebola outbreak also causes new concerns.

'That is a virus that can affect ape populations as well as humans,' Leahy said.

'We don't yet know the toll on wild gorillas and chimpanzees.'

Kwan and Bahati were made to breed as a part of the Western Lowland Gorilla Species Survival Plan.
