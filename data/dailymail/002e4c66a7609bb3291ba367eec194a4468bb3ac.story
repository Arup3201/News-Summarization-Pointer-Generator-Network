Against the odds: Colin Young's cerebral palsy, has not stopped him from pursuing an acting career

As the stars of tonight’s controversial and much talked-about episode of  Call The Midwife – watched by about nine million viewers each week – actors Colin Young and Sarah Gordy are unarguably hot property.

They play a young couple, Sally Harper and Jacob Milligan, who are both ‘patients’ in a home for the disabled – forced apart, and mocked when she becomes pregnant.

Sally’s parents are disgusted to discover she is expecting Jacob’s child, branding it unnatural and preventing him from seeing her again.

The desperately sad scenario was a routine way of handling the situation in the 1950s. Campaigners have welcomed the storyline, saying it showed how far we have come as a society in accepting diversity.

Yet the actors – who have the same disabilities as their on-screen personas, Sarah with Down’s syndrome and Colin with cerebral palsy – believe there’s still a long way to go.

Colin, 27, was once told a career in showbusiness would be little more than a pipedream.

‘They said no one would want to watch a disabled person on TV,’ he reveals – declining to name the culprit.

‘So Call The Midwife is a big “I can do it even if you think I can’t”.’

Sarah, 25, adds: ‘Although I thank God I wasn’t born at that time, and I got very angry when reading the script about people being put in institutions, some of those attitudes are still around.’

Both welcome anything that gets people talking about equality, and accepting that disabled people have romantic relationships.

‘We’re all different and all part of society. We have a right to fall in love,’ adds Sarah.

Colin says: ‘It was very courageous of Call The Midwife to bring to the forefront such an unspoken about topic as people with disabilities having relationships.

'Jacob is a young guy wanting a family and being in love rather than just a person with a disability who has to be cared for.’

But even 60 years after the drama is set, portrayals of sex and love among people with disabilities are so rare it provokes strong feelings – something that baffles Colin.

‘My brother and his partner are both disabled and I went to a school for disabled people so I grew up seeing disabled people fall in love,’ he says. ‘But relationships among disabled people are still taboo, although with shows like The Undateables [Channel 4’s programme about people with disabilities dating] able-bodied people are becoming intrigued.’

Colin was diagnosed with cerebral palsy aged two after a traumatic birth in which he was strangled by the umbilical cord. Starved of oxygen, he suffered brain damage that led to his condition – which affects the way the brain communicates with the muscles, causing stiffness and problems with movement.

He wasn’t expected to survive, but surpassed doctors’ expectations and learnt to walk and talk.

Today, as we sit in a pub in North London, he speaks more slowly and quietly than most – and also with more effort, as cerebral palsy can affect the vocal cords – but this doesn’t dampen his vociferousness. Colin is working on a PhD as well as appearing in the hit BBC show. And like his character, he’s looking for love and wanting a family.

‘Apart from one or two able-bodied people, I’ve mostly dated disabled people,’ he says, pointing out this is partly because of his environment. His first girlfriend, for example, went to the same sixth-form boarding college for disabled pupils as he did.

But there are advantages to being with another disabled person. ‘You have a mutual understanding of what it’s like having an impairment so you don’t need to explain,’ he says. ‘But that can also make you think you have more in common than you do. So there are pros and cos. I just try to see the person as an individual, not according to what their disability is. It’s about a similar outlook and whether we can connect on an emotional level.’

But a 2008 poll by ICM Research found 70 per cent of able-bodied people wouldn’t date someone with a physical disability.

‘They’re writing off a tenth of the population,’ says Colin. His longest relationship has been 18 months, and the dating game for someone who has a personal assistant to help him dress, cook and eat has practical challenges.

‘It’s been hard,’ he says. ‘I’m not going to lie.’ Even making the first move has its obstacles. ‘Having a disability, you’re not sure how they’re going to react and you mostly meet people in bars and clubs where it’s harder because the music drowns out my speech.

‘Also, buying someone a drink is tricky as I can’t carry a glass,’ he says, sipping tea through a straw.

Online dating has proved fruitful, though, and he prefers to use generic sites rather than those for the disabled. ‘Inclusion is the main principle disabled people – and society – should strive for. I always tell women before we meet [about having cerebral palsy] and normally the reaction is positive. They say, “Thanks for telling me,” or they’re intrigued.’

When dates don’t progress beyond a first meeting, he is left wondering whether it’s because of his cerebral palsy. ‘But you can’t exactly ask people – they would get defensive as everyone likes to portray themselves as open-minded.’ Some women become maternal towards him. ‘I can sense condescension. And I also try to resist those who think I’m somehow inspiring. Yes, there have been barriers and I’ve worked hard to break them down, but I wouldn’t call that anything other than fighting for what is rightfully achievable.’

Mostly he is an old-fashioned romantic – although there can be pitfalls. ‘There have been barriers to having romantic nights alone as neither of us can pour a glass of wine or eat alone, but laughing it off helps.’

Colin would like to have children and is optimistic about finding love. He already has a role model: his big brother.‘Nathan, who’s 29, has arthritis and is in a civil partnership with a man who has cerebral palsy. They have a very happy, loving relationship despite discrimination on a few levels. I’m very proud of them.’

Although we’ve witnessed a sea change in attitudes since the 1950s, Colin is deeply concerned about complacency settling in after the 2012 Paralympics. ‘Hearing people talk about how attractive the athletes were, like Jonnie Peacock, was the best thing – that was incredible. But the Games hasn’t had as big an impact as we would have hoped. We can’t just do a one-off blast to inclusion – then it fades way. We need to put the time, effort and resources into continuing that legacy. We need disabled people to be valued as contributors to our whole society.’
