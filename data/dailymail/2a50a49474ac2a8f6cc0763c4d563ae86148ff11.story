A would-be burglar was looking to cash in, but instead found himself in a world of pain when a Georgia mother who refused to be victimized shot him multiple times in the face and neck.

The Loganville woman, who was not identified, was in the home with her 9-year-old twins on Friday afternoon when someone began ringing the doorbell.

Thinking it was just a door-to-door salesperson, she didn't answer.

Home invasion: Melinda was at home with her nine-year-old twins in their Loganville home, when the suspect began ringing the doorbell before breaking in

Investigation: A sheriff's deputy is pictured outside the home following the shooting on Friday

More than he bargained for: Melinda Herman can he heard firing all six rounds of the handgun, missing only once

But after the ringing persisted, the person began prying the door open with a crowbar.

She quickly retreated to an attic crawlspace with the children, but not before she also picked up her handgun.

The burglar, whom police identified as 
Paul Ali Slater, did a room-by-room search of the home, and when he 
reached the attic, she was ready.

Walton County Sheriff Joe Chapman told WSBTV: 'The perpetrator opens that door. Of course, at that time he’s staring at her, her two children and a .38 revolver.'

She reportedly fired all six rounds, missing only once. The other shots hit Slater about the face and neck.

Sheriff Chapman told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution: 'The guy’s face down, crying. The woman told him to stay down or she’d shoot again.'

Slater did eventually get up and managed to return to his vehicle that was parked outside the home, but his injuries left him unable to drive, and it wasn't long before he crashed into a wooded area.

He was found by sheriff's deputies, bleeding heavily in a driveway on the block.

Sheriff Chapman told the paper that he was pleading with his deputies, saying: 'I'm dying. Help me.'

He was carted off to Gwinnet Medical Center for treatment of the gunshot wounds, and he is expected to survive.

WSBTV reported that Slater has a long criminal history and was released from prison in August.

The woman's husband, Donnie Herman, is just glad his wife and kids are safe.

Mr Herman told WSBTV: 'My wife is a hero. She protected her kids. She did what she was supposed to do as a responsible, prepared gun owner.'

Not exactly a clean getaway: Slater managed to return to his vehicle, but his injuries left him unable to drive, and it wasn't long before he crashed into a wooded area

Husband: Donnie Herman says he is proud of his wife, and he's glad his family is safe
