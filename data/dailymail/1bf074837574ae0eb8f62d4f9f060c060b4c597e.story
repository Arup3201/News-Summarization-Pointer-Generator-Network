A 50-year-old shopper was asked for ID when he tried to buy a £2.60 bag of mixed nuts and a pair of bananas from Tesco.

Tony Morris fancied a snack as he made his way home from dinner on Tuesday night, so popped into his local supermarket in Carlton Hill, Nottingham.

But the peckish housing association manager was shocked and 'embarrassed' when the self-service checkout warned the salted mixed nuts were an age-restricted product.

Nutty: Tony Morris was asked for ID when he tried to buy a £2.60 bag of mixed nuts and a pair of bananas from Tesco

A security guard and a Tesco worker approached Mr Morris after the 'ID required' message - usually reserved for alcohol, age-rated DVDs and painkillers - appeared on the screen.

Mr Morris said: 'I'd been out for a meal and fancied a snack because there were small portions.

'I grabbed some nuts and a couple of bananas. I put the bananas through the self service checkout and then the nuts. That's when the red  lights came on and blue ones started flashing too. There was a message on the screen saying 'Age verification required'.

'I wasn't a happy bunny when they said I needed ID. A security guard and a member of staff came over.'

'I stood at the machine wondering what I had done wrong to attract so much attention and staring. I said I wasn't even buying alcohol, and was told that it sometimes goes off for alcohol-related products, but I'm still not sure what these could have been.

Mr Morris, who said he needed the healthy snack because he is diabetic, added: 'Although staff laughed it off, it is embarrassing when you are highlighted for doing nothing wrong. Do I need to take my passport and driving licence to purchase my breakfast?

'They let me go but it was embarrassing as everyone was looking at me.'

The shopper, who paid £2.60 for the mixture of Brazil nuts, cashews, almonds, hazelnuts and pecans, as well as 29p for the pair of bananas, said he did not know if he would return to the store after the incident.

A Tesco spokeswoman said: 'We don't age restrict the sale of nuts - our store team have rechecked all the nuts in the store to ensure this is the case. 

'Giving customers great service is our number one priority and we're sorry if the incident caused our customer any inconvenience.'

Earlier this month, a 37-year-old Tesco shopper from Plymouth was told she needed ID to buy fruit because it could ferment and turn into alcohol.

Kate Lancaster was trying to buy a packet of melon and grapes at the self-service checkout of a Tesco Metro when a warning appeared saying the product was age-restricted.

A Tesco spokesman said at the time: 'Our customer service colleague’s comment about natural fermentation was meant as a joke – we’re sorry if it was taken literally.'
