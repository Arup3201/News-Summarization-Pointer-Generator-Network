Sharp-tongued Welsh designer Julien Macdonald famously branded Cheryl Cole a 'chav' and claimed that plus-size models were a 'joke'.

But it seems that the Duchess of Cambridge has won over the catty catwalk king.

The fashion designer has praised Kate's maternity style and says that pregnancy has made her sexier than ever.

Sexy style: Welsh designer Julien Macdonald has spoken out to rave about the Duchess of Cambridge's sexy maternity style

Speaking to Grazia Daily at the launch of his new swimwear line with Melissa Odabash, the 42-year-old said: 'Kate Middleton has an effortless style.

'I love how short her dresses are now she’s pregnant. It’s not something you normally see on pregnant women and it’s bound to start a new maternity trend.

'Those dresses are actually very short, shorter than she ever wears usually. That’s been her trick, and it’s working – pregnancy has made her sexier.'

And it seems he isn't alone in his views.

The Duchess of Cambridge's penchant 
for smart, feminine maternity wear has sparked a nationwide trend among 
Britain's other mothers-to-be.

Short but sweet: 'Those dresses are actually very short, shorter than she ever wears usually. That's been her trick, and it's working - pregnancy has made her sexier', says Julien

Department
 store chain Debenhams has seen sales of sophisticated dresses and smart
 styles in their maternity collections increase by more than 500 per 
cent compared to this time last year, and is attributing this to 
pregnant women wanting to emulate the Duchess' well-documented elegant 
look.

With
 not a pair of dungarees, leggings or a smock in sight, the Duchess of 
Cambridge has continued to paint a picture of elegance throughout her 
pregnancy.

For her, 
maternity style has meant neatly tailored coats that skim her burgeoning
 bump, smart dresses with empire line or wrap styling and just a hint of
 a higher hemline to emphasise her still-slender legs.

Women are also emulating Kate's 
off-duty look, with pretty woven tops and cropped capri trousers selling
well, with some lines up more than 500 per cent.

Due to the popularity of elegant maternity wear styles and shapes, Debenhams is dubbing the trend 'The Duchess Effect'.

No holding back: The designer, who previously branded Cheryl Cole a 'chav', also said Madonna's use of guns was 'insensitive'

Whilst Macdonald, who has an OBE for services to fashion, gushed about the Duchess, he didn't hold back when it came to discussing Madonna.

He attacked the 54-year-old for her ‘insensitive’ use of guns saying that she should be more sensitive to people's feelings.

Julien also famously hit out at the nation's sweetheart, Cheryl Cole, calling her a 'chav' and telling her that her newly-coloured red hair 
looked terrible at mutual friend Sarah Harding's Halloween party three years ago.

Cheryl, who even attended the 
designer's show before their argument, was told to sack her stylist by 
the 41-year-old Britain and Ireland's Next Top Model judge.

While
 Julien was the one who designed the slashed military suit that Cheryl 
made a fashion hit in her number one song Fight For This Love, the 
pair's friendship has most certainly fizzled.

The designer also made controversial comments during his time as a judge on Britain And Ireland's Next Top Model, saying that a plus-size model should not 
win the competition.
