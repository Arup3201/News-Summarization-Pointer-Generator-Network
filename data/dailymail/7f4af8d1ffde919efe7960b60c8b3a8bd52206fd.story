The Grammy-nominated band GWAR was founded in 1984 and is known for its comically grotesque costumes, stage antics and vulgar lyrics.

Brockie was the mastermind of the band and its founding member.

He remained a constant in GWAR, though it has had a revolving door of members. In 2011, 34-year-old lead guitarist Cory Smoot was found dead on the band's tour bus.

GWAR, who described themselves as 'Scumdogs of the Universe', released their 13th album last year and recently toured Australia and Japan.

Brockie always appeared on stage as an intergalactic humanoid barbarian with devil horns and a meaty-looking face, carrying a long sword called an 'Unt Lick'.

The heavy metal band gained international fame for their outrageous stage show and wild personas, with GWAR members creating their own gory costumes.

Their video clips were also a staple of TV show 'Beavis and Butt-Head'.

'Anyone who has seen GWAR knows itâ€™s an adult comedy rock musical,' Brockie told CBS 6 reporter Mark Holmberg in 2011.

Style Weekly reported Brockie was a devoted fan of the Washington Redskins and a World War II buff, who had recently fulfilled his lifelong dreams of visiting Stalingrad and playing shows in Japan.
