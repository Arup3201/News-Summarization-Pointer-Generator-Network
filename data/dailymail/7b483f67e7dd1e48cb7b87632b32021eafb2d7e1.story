This is the bizarre moment a hungry thief was captured on camera breaking into a deli using a crow bar before stealing a single bag of crisps.

CCTV footage shows the man breaking the door of the deli before creeping into Deli A Go Go in Cardiff, to take a packet of sour cream and sweet onion Kettle Chips.

And the thief is even forced to run back to the store after realising he has left behind his crow bar.

Entrance: A hungry thief was captured on camera breaking into Deli A Go Go in Cardiff using a crow bar

Probe: Police have said they believe the break in to Bev Davidson's shop is linked to a further eight crimes

Police have said they believe the 
break-in to Bev Davidson’s shop is linked to a further eight crimes in 
the area that took place in the early hours of last Friday.

She
 said: ‘When the police saw the footage they couldn't believe it. He 
tried for an hour to get in, spent three minutes in the shop, presumably
 looking for cash and only left with one packet of crisps.

‘The
 police joked that at that rate he's not even making minimum wage. He 
must have been hungry. I left the shop at 9pm and came back at 7am the 
next morning to find that we had been broken into.

‘They
 didn't get anything because there is not really anything to take. They 
smashed the glass at the front, but none of the neighbours heard. I just
 can't get over how brazen they were about it.’

South
 Wales Police said that there had been a number of break-ins in the 
whole of the Fairwater area of Cardiff, which includes Whitchurch and 
Rhiwbina, in recent weeks.

His favourite flavour? The burglar took a packet of sour cream and sweet onion Kettle Chips (file picture)

A spokesman said: ‘There have been a number of commercial burglaries in the Fairwater area of Cardiff recently. Each burglary is being thoroughly investigated and we have increased patrols in order to trace those responsible.

'He tried for an hour to get in, spent three minutes in the shop, presumably looking for cash and only left with one packet of crisps. The police joked that at that rate he's not even making minimum wage'

Bev Davidson, Deli A Go Go owner

‘I would like to remind residents and business owners of steps they can take to ensure windows and doors are kept secure as this will remove the opportunity for any burglar.’

Deli worker Nick Robinson said: ‘The shop is alarmed and the cash tills are alarmed, so they tried but there was no way of getting into it.

'There was a bit of damage where it looks like he might have fallen over.

'But apart from that and the packet of green Kettle Chips not much else was taken. There was only one person caught on film, but because of the other break-ins it makes you wonder if they were working alone.'
