Arsenal's powderpuff performance in Dortmund underlined their dire need to find a physical presence in midfield. A man willing to sacrifice himself for the team, to do the jobs that Arsenal's silky footballers seem unprepared to do. 

As Arsene Wenger this week admitted: 'I’m happy with the signings we have made but we still need a physical presence with prodigious ability like Vieira or Petit.'

Here Sportsmail looks at some of the targets in his sights.

Arsene Wenger watched his midfield get completely over-run by Jurgen Klopp's side 

LASSANA DIARRA

Former Portsmouth midfielder was in discussions over a deal to join QPR prior to the transfer deadline closing but delays in his acrimonious release from Lokomotiov Moscow slowed down the process. Harry Redknapp needed a guaranteed starter and pressed ahead with his bid for Sandro instead. 

Diarra is free and is willing to accept a role as a squad player on a short term deal. Arsene Wenger knows the former France international well after signing him in 2007 from Chelsea but he grew frustrated at lack of first team opportunities then. At 29, he still has enough quality to make a contribution and discipline to play the holding midfield role.

VICTOR WANYAMA

The Kenya international is unsettled at Southampton and has been on Arsenal's radar for two years. The 23-year-old is one of the unsung members of Southampton's coveted squad as he has the disciplined mindset to sit in front of the back four and allows his teammates to move forward. 

Has a knack of performing well against the bigger teams and was outstanding in their unfortunate defeat at Anfield on the opening weekend of the Premier League season. Wanyama is still only 23, is big, strong, good on the ball and has European experience from his time with Celtic. He could prove a good investment for Arsenal's future at £15million.

WILLIAM CARVALHO

The Portugal international is overpriced but has potential. Sporting wanted £23.8million for him last month and Arsenal were reluctant to offer more than £18m. Indecision in the transfer market at Arsenal has often cost them and this could prove another example. 

Carvalho is 22 years old is powerful, versatile and has the physical attributes of a Vieira but lacks composure. He can be rash in the tackle but that could be put down to the over exuberance of youth. Sporting need the money and are willing to negotiate with Arsenal for January. A deal could be reached with the promise of greater add-ons based performances.

LARS BENDER

The 25-year-old Bayer Leverkusen midfielder, twin of Borussia Dortmund defensive midfielder Sven Bender, is a more all-round player similar to the model Wenger has been searching for. However, the payer's injury record goes against him and Leverkusen still want big money for the Germany international who is one year into a six-year contract. 

Has good vision and passing skills to accompany great defensive workrate. He has strength and would fit into the Premier League well but may be too many risks for Wenger. Germany have favoured Sami Khedira and the emerging Christoph Kramer - another Leverkusen player on loan at Monchengladbach.

Lars Bender is a jack of all trades in midfield and would provide Arsene Wenger with versatility 

GIANELLI IMBULA

The 22-year-old has been watched by Arsenal since his days at Guingamp where he was also closely followed by Chelsea. indeed Arsenal came close to striking a deal with Guingamp two years ago before Marseille stepped in. 

He has continued to develop and Marseille are always open to striking a deal. He is opinionated which has cost him his place in the France U21 squad in the past but should mature with experience and the right advice. Is aggressive, likes a tackle and can pass. He is 6ft 1ins tall and athletic but may lack discipline at this stage.
