A former gang member, juvenile inmate and high school dropout could become the next lieutenant governor of Nevada - and the most high profile Hispanic Democrat in the U.S.

State Assemblywoman Lucy Flores, 34, is the party's nomination for June's election, when she will go head-to-head with top attorney and state senator Mark Hutchison from the GOP.

The election is considered particularly important because whoever wins will take over as governor when Gov. Brian Sandoval likely vacates his office to challenge Senator Harry Reid in 2016.

It means that Flores, who was born into an impoverished family of 13 children and repeatedly clashed with the law before turning her life around, would finally give the Democrats a high-profile candidate to appeal to Hispanic voters.

Key candidate: Nevada Assemblywoman Lucy Flores, pictured in May, could become the next lieutenant governor of the state - and the most high profile Hispanic Democrat in the U.S.

'I don't have the background of a typical politician, right?' she told a crowd of Democratic activists as she accepted the party’s nomination, MSNBC reported in a lengthy profile of her this weekend.

There is also that Flores will be able to appeal to Latino voters, battling the Republican party's Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and New Mexico's Susana Martinez - making her a key figure for the Democrats.

'There are Lucys in every town across 
this state,' she told activists. 'That's why my focus is on making sure 
that this is a state that works for every Nevadan, not just the 
privileged few.'

Flores, who has a rose tattoo on her ankle, had a troubled childhood before she went to college and eventually became a lawyer and state legislator.

When she was a toddler, her mariachi singer father 
moved the family from California, where she was born, to Nevada after two of her 
older brothers were killed in gang-related violence.

She initially took well to the new home, but when her mother suddenly left the family when Flores was nine, things took a turn for the worst.

As she hit her teen years, Flores was failing classes and hanging out with gangs, eventually committing petty crimes such as theft and running away from home.

But after she stole a car to drive to a store to steal beer, police signaled for her to move over - and she hit the gas.

'I led them on a bit of a low speed chase through half of a neighborhood that I currently represent,' she recalled, MSNBC reported.

that this is a state that works for every Nevadan, not just the 
privileged few'

After they caught her, she spent most of the following year in a juvenile detention center, leaving when she was 15 - and vowing not to return.

Still, she ran into problems with the law again and was ultimately helped by a tough parole officer, Leslie Camp, who urged a judge to release the troubled teen after another arrest.

'I
 recognized she had a lot of familial issues,' Camp told MSNBC. 'She basically needed some mentoring and 
direction, but she had a good heart.'

At 17, she left high school to work at a doctor's office before becoming a receptionist at a local women's prison and finally working as an office manager for an accounting firm in Los 
Angeles.

But then she hit a ceiling: higher-up positions required a degree.

She returned to Las Vegas, earned a GED, enrolled in her local 
community college and received a scholarship to the University of Southern California where she decided to study law.

'Growing up, I'd had all these interactions with the law,' she said. 'I'd always tell myself "I could be my own lawyer".'

She then went on to study at
 the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, where she helped found a clinic to 
challenge wrongful convictions.

From there, she started to lobby the state
 legislature for new reforms and was inspired to run for 
state Assembly and by 2011, she was representing her former neighborhood.

Flores, who is single, is not afraid of referring to her troubled past when throwing her support by issues or calling for reform.

Mostly famously, she revealed in 2012 as she testified in support for the expansion of school health programs that she had undergone an abortion aged 16.

'I had six other sisters… all of them
 became pregnant in their teens – all of them,' she had said. 'One of 
them was 14 years old when she got pregnant with twins.

'Since
 I’m sharing so much this session, I might as well keep going. I always said that I was the only one who didn't have kids in 
their teenage years. That's because at 16, I got an abortion.'

She explained how she had begged her father to pay the $200 for the procedure because she didn't want to be like her sisters. She said she had no regrets about the decision.

After the testimony, she was attacked by anti-abortion activists and lauded by pro-choice groups, while other women reached out to share their own stories with her.

'Demographically, she's perfect: Young, dynamic, Hispanic,' Harry Reid has said.

'Our
 young women can be able to actually look at the governor’s mansion and 
see that there is a woman - a woman of color - who was actually able to 
come from District 28 and become the governor of Nevada.'

If she takes over the governorship - by filling Reid's vacancy or winning in 2018 - she would become the most high profile Hispanic Democrat in the U.S.
