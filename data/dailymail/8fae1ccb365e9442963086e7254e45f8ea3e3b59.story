A 10,500-square-foot, three-floor luxurious apartment owned by a Saudi prince that has three panic rooms and a clear view of the Hudson River in New York's Upper West Side has been put on the market for $48.5million - down from the $75million price is was listed for in 2012.

The apartment, reportedly owned by Prince Nawaf bin Sultan bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, is located in the Heritage at Trump Palace and has four bedrooms, four bathrooms and six half bathrooms.

Saudi Prince Nawaf bin Abdulaziz Al Saud's 10,500-square-foot Upper West Side three-floor apartment has been listed for $48.5million

The condo, which is located in the Heritage at Trump Palace, is filled with marble slabs and beautiful furniture. It might be sold furnished

This Jacuzzi is just one amazing feature in the home. The apartment also has three bullet-proof panic rooms and a fitness center

The prince is reportedly selling the massive Upper West Side condo because he doesn't use the residence as much as he would like

One reason the prince doesn't use the apartment could be the fact that he is confined to a wheelchair. He suffered a stroke in 2002, according to The Washington Institute.  

The home was originally created by merging six smaller units of the 31-story condo building on the fifth, sixth and seventh floors, according to court records released by the Wall Street Journal.

With large slabs of Calacatta marble throughout the space, the apartment has three bulletproof panic rooms, a gym, billiards room, hair salon, a ventilated cigar room, a fully automated smart-home feature and a 60ft living room that overlooks the Hudson River.

The apartment also has a built-in saltwater aquariums, a sushi bar, outdoor terraces, a spa and a six-person Jacuzzi.

There are also monthly common charges of $19,705 and buyers have the option of hiring the apartment's current caretaker, according to Curbed. 

The apartment is listed by a corporation in which Prince Nawaf bin Sultan bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud is the principal, according to a lawsuit relating to a past sale in the building.
