Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, attempting to lay to rest his controversial remarks about President Barack Obama's patriotism, is now admitting that he can't question the Commander in Chief's 'mind or heart.'

'My blunt language suggesting that the president doesn’t love America notwithstanding, I didn’t intend to question President Obama’s motives or the content of his heart,' Giuliani said in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal. 

'My intended focus really was the effect his words and his actions have on the morale of the country, and how that effect may damage his performance. Let me explain.'

Giuliani, who has taken heavy fire for the remarks he made last week at a New York City dinner hosted by prominent conservatives, argued that Obama is guilty of 'criticizing his country more than other presidents have done.'

Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, pictured here on the set of Cavuto in September, attempted to lay to rest his controversial remarks about President Barack Obama's patriotism today in an op-ed this weekend. He is now admitting that he can't the the Commander in Chief's 'mind or heart'

'Furthermore, this president sometimes seems to have a difficult time in expressing adequate support for important allies, particularly Israel, Ukraine and Jordan,' he added.

The 2008 Republican presidential candidate claimed that he bears Obama 'no ill will, and in fact think that his personal journey is inspiring and a testament to much of what makes this country great'.

But he expressed doubt that Obama 'can rise to the occasion and underscore America’s greatness as our history and values merit.'

'If he does so, I will be the first to applaud him,' Giuliani wrote. 'But I can only be disheartened when I hear him claim, as he did last August, that our response to 9/11 betrayed the ideals of this country. 

'When he interjected that “we tortured some folks,” he undermined those who managed successfully to protect us from further attack,' he asserted. 

Giuliani said he also takes issue with Obama's past critiques of American exceptionalism. 

To say the U.S is 'no more exceptional than the exceptionalism of any other country in the world, does not suggest a becoming and endearing modesty, but rather a stark lack of moral clarity,' he argued.

Fondly referred to as 'America's mayor' for his tenure as New York City's top political official during the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center, Giuliani's legacy has taken a hit in the last week following his stern rebuke of Obama.

'I know this is a horrible thing to say, but I do not believe that the president loves America.' Giuliani said during the speech. 'He doesn’t love you. And he doesn’t love me. He wasn’t brought up the way you were brought up and I was brought up through love of this country.'

The flap ballooned as Giuliani repeatedly tried to clarify his remarks.

The day after the dinner, the Republican told Fox News he was not, in fact, questioning Obama's 'patriotism' and was being reported. 'He's a patriot, I'm sure,' Giuliani told the news station. 

'What I'm saying is, in his rhetoric, I very rarely hear him say the things that I used to hear Ronald Reagan say, the things that I used to hear Bill Clinton say, about how much he loves America.' 

And on Friday, Giuliani told the New York Daily News his concern about the president's morals dates back to young Obama's introduction to Frank Marshall Davis, a communist organizer, via his grandfather, and his relationships with quasi-communist' figures Saul Alinsky and Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Obama's former pastor whose radicals sermons caused a stir in the months before the 2008 presidential election. 

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker walks through a crowd to take his seat for the opening session of the National Governors Association Winter Meeting in Washington on Saturday, where he floundered in the face of tough questions about Giuliani's remarks and his beliefs about Obama's faith

Also attending the Manhattan dinner at which Giuliani spoke was Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who also made remarks, but they were deemed off the record.

Walker, considered likely to bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, offered a muddled response when asked about Giuliani's comments.

'I don’t know, I honestly don’t know, one way or the other,' Walker told the Washington Post on Saturday when he was again asked to give his views on Obama's patriotism.

He also refused to say whether he believes that Obama is a Christian, adding a new dimension to the discussion.

'I’ve actually never talked about it or I haven’t read about that,' Walker said of the president's faith. 'I’ve never asked him that.'

'You’ve asked me to make statements about people that I haven’t had a conversation with about that. How [could] I say if I know either of you are a Christian?' he asked the Post reporters.

His spokeswoman subsequently claimed he was trying to highlight 'gotcha' questions from 'the media' out of 'principle'. It is unclear if he was ever previously articulated such a principle.

Other likely contenders for the White House opted to distance themselves from Giuliani.

'Governor Bush doesn’t question President Obama’s motives. He does question President Obama’s disastrous policies,' aides to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said in a statement on Friday.

Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul gave a similar response to a local radio station on Friday when the subject came up.

'I think it’s a mistake to question people’s motives. It’s one thing to disagree on policy,' he said.

Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said he doesn't think it's his responsibility 'to answer for every person in my party that makes a claim.'

'I’ll suffice it to say that I believe the President loves America; I think his ideas are bad,' the freshman senator said.

South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham told ABC News on Sunday, 'Well, I love Rudy, but I don’t want to go there. The nation’s very divided, President Obama has divided us more than he’s brought us together and I don’t want to add to that division.'

He added: 'I have no doubt that he loves his country, I have no doubt that he’s a patriot. But his primary job as President of the United States is to defend this country, and he’s failing miserably.'

Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, a potential dark horse candidate for the presidency, likewise praised Giuliani when questioned about his claims on Sunday morning, calling him 'a great American,' in the context of the 9/11, of Fox News Sunday.

However, he said, 'I don’t think it helps to question the president’s patriotism or motives.'

The rumble led one of Giuliani's former communications aides, Mike Paul, stating that his previous employer had 'lost the throne' as America's mayor and that his remarks were an 'abomination,' according to Mediaite.

Speaking about the dust up on Friday, the president's spokesman said Friday he felt sorry for Giuliani.

'I can tell you that it's sad to see when somebody who has attained a certain stature and even admiration tarnishes that legacy so thoroughly,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters during his daily briefing.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Sunday that Giuliani's statements were 'very regrettable.'

'His comments were not helpful...And I'm sorry to see statements like that coming from the former mayor whose response to 9/11 in 2001 I admired very much,' Johnson said on CNN's State of the Union.
