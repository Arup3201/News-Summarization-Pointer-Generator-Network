Authorities have found a body inside the perimeter of a wildfire that destroyed 30 homes and forced the evacuation of 300 others in Northern California.

The burnt body of Brian Stanley Henry, 56, was found inside a motor home that was destroyed by the fire, Shasta County coroner's Lt. Mark Lillibridge said on Wednesday.

Sheriff's deputies discovered Henry's body late Tuesday while checking his home in the community of Igo.

Beginnings: The fire broke out August 17 in a remote area of Stanislaus National Forest near Jawbone ridge

The Clover Fire broke out Monday afternoon in the community of Happy Valley, about 150 miles north of Sacramento, and winds sent it spreading at 500 acres an hour. Residents were given just minutes to grab their belongings and leave, as the fire jumped roads and engulfed homes.

The fire burned nearly 11 square miles. Cooler weather has helped firefighters contain 40 per cent of the blaze.

Evacuation orders remained for the 300 homes, though at least some might be lifted later in the day, state fire spokesman Mike Witesman said.

'Things are looking good,' he said.

Thomas Texeira said he initially battled the flames but left when the fire came within 200 yards of his home.

'I drove through a wall of flames,' Teixeira told the Record Searchlight of Redding about his narrow escape.

Meanwhile, the Rim Fire in and around Yosemite National Park was 80 percent contained, with full containment expected Sept. 20. That blaze burned nearly 400 square miles.

Firefighters also gained ground on a wildfire burning in a San Francisco Bay Area wilderness park.

Containment of the Morgan Fire at Mount Diablo State Park in Contra Costa County increased to 70 percent overnight. The fire has burned a little less than 5 square miles. All evacuations had been lifted, and full containment was expected by Friday.

The Rim Fire, named for a popular local lookout spot called Rim of the 
World, has charred more than 237,000 acres, or 370 square miles (958 
square kilometers), of timber and chaparral since it erupted August 17 
in an area known as Jawbone Ridge in a remote corner of the national 
forest.

The precise origins of the so-called Rim Fire, which erupted nearly 
three weeks ago in the Stanislaus National Forest west of Yosemite, 
remained under investigation, and no arrests have been made, the U.S. 
Forest Service said.

Officials have said the Rim Fire was caused by a hunter. The causes of the other two fires remain under investigation.

Beyond saying the fire began 'when a hunter allowed an illegal fire to escape,' authorities declined to comment on evidence linking the hunter to the blaze. The individual has not been publicly identified.

Word that investigators had traced the fire's origins to a hunter's campfire came a day after authorities ruled out the possibility that the Rim Fire somehow began from an illegal marijuana cultivation site in the national forest.

Speculation that a pot farm might be to blame grew out of videotaped comments made by a local fire department chief during an August 23 community meeting, but fire officials again denied any such connection to the blaze, or to the hunter in question.

'There is no indication the hunter was involved with illegal marijuana cultivation on public lands and no marijuana cultivation sites were located near the origin of the fire,' the Forest Service said in its statement.
