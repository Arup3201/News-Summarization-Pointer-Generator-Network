Nestled in the heart of the English countryside, this grade I listed Georgian mansion comes not only with 16 bedrooms, 10 reception rooms and eight bathrooms but also with its own separate castle.

Steeped in history, Mamhead House, situated on the outskirts of Exeter in Devon, featured in the Domesday Book and its ownership has been passed through several distinguished families.

Once home to royalty - Queen Adelaide, wife to William IV, stayed so regularly she had her own room – the property has now gone on the market for a staggering £9.5million.

Built from Bath stone and set in a sprawling estate in rural countryside, the mansion (front) overlooks beautiful views of the east Devon coast. The estate, which is on the market for offers in excess of £9.5million, also includes a castle (behind), as well as the main house and gardens

The main house, which is built from Bath stone and set in a sprawling estate in rural Devon countryside, boasts large bedrooms and reception rooms, as well as an additional attic which contains a further 11 bedrooms.

The mansion is approached by a long winding drive through 70 acres of woodland and has galleried halls, landings and corridors, a main kitchen/breakfast room, a secondary kitchen/butler's pantry and extensive domestic offices and cellars.

There is also a two-bedroom staff bungalow together with garages, outbuildings and an estate yard.

In the grounds, there is also a grade II listed Georgian castle, which boasts six offices and is included in the sale price.

The castle, designed by British architect Anthony Salvin, is a replica of the 14th century Belsay Castle in Northumberland.

Constructed of local red sandstone, it was originally used to provide stabling, a coach house, laundry and brewery. A passage linked the brewery with the house cellars.

Today, the castle has been completely modernised and is laid out in six office suites which can be let to provide an additional income, although they are vacant at present.

Visitors to the castle are met by a central courtyard, before being directed through a massive gatehouse complete with portcullis to the historic building.

The 164-acre estate overlooks a stunning Italian sunken garden which features a Salvin fountain and sundial, as well as large swathes of beautiful parkland with views of the east Devon coast to Portland Bill.

James Baker, head of Strutt & Parker in Exeter, described both the castle and main house as having 'gothic influences' and said the estate was an 'exciting opportunity' for a potential buyer.

He said: 'If you want a picturesque stately home in the south west, Mamhead is the finest opportunity to present itself in years and undoubtedly one of the most important houses in the south of England.

'Tucked away in the Haldon Hills, you get complete privacy and stunning countryside, yet you are easily accessible to the M5 and Exeter airport.

The Mamhead estate was established in the 13th century and has had a house in its grounds ever since, although it has been refurbished

The estate is being advertised as the 'finest opportunity to present itself in years and one of the most important houses in southern England'

'The house is particularly suited to a buyer who is interested in a historical property, with Mamhead being Grade I listed with classical Georgian proportions and gothic influences.

'I would describe the house as one fit for a Queen, quite literally having hosted royalty, and in fact, Queen Adelaide, wife to William IV, stayed so often that a bedroom was set aside for her sole use and is still called "The Queen's Room".

'The house, the castle which is now offices, staff bungalow, outbuildings, agricultural land and woodland which is all on offer, provide a hugely diverse and exciting opportunity.'

The Mamhead estate was established in the 13th century and has had a house in its grounds ever since, although the main house has been refurbished on several occasions.

The original house was bought by the Balle family and in 1672, Peter Balle - an attorney to Queen Henrietta Maria - was awarded a Baronetcy for his services to her. Later, William of Orange billeted his supporters on the Estate.

Mamhead then passed into the hands of the Earls of Lisburne, who sold the Estate in 1822 to R W Newman, MP for Exeter.

The current Mamhead House was built around 1828 as a 'Marriage House' for Robert Newman and his new bride, Mary.

The initials of both appear entwined throughout the house and the family motto, 'Ubi amor ibi fides' ('Where there is love there is trust') is beautifully carved above the front door and repeated in various places throughout the house.

The estate continued in the family until 1985, but under the fifth baronet the house was let first as a holiday centre for evangelical clergy, and later as a school. 

The entire estate, which has now returned to being privately-owned, has now gone on the market with estate agent Strutt & Parker and offers in excess of £9.5million are being considered.

In the 13th Century, Mamhead belonged to the Peverell family, from whom it passed by marriage to Sir Nicholas Carew in the early 14th Century. 

In 1547 it was sold to Giles Balle of Axminster. Sir Peter Balle rebuilt an existing house near the parish church in the mid-17th Century.

Sir Peter Balle and Thomas Balle were noted sylviculturists, and the latter introduced cork oaks, ilex oaks, wainscot or Turkey oaks, acacias, Spanish chestnuts and various cedars into his plantations.

The Exeter nurseryman William Lucombe was employed as gardener at Mamhead by Thomas Balle.

The early and mid-18th Century gardens were formal, with terraces, fountains and pools on the hillside above the House.

In 1749, Thomas Balle, the last of the family, left Mamhead to his relative Thomas Apreece, who sold it to Joseph Nightingale.

From Nightingale it passed by inheritance in 1755 to the third Viscount Lisburne, created Earl of Lisburne in 1776.

In 1769, Robert Adam provided plans for the improvement of the house and alteration of a cascade house, which appear to have been implemented, while in 1778 the grounds were improved with the advice of Lancelot Brown.

Mamhead remained the principal seat of the earls of Lisburne until 1822, when the estate was sold by the third Earl to R W Newman, a merchant from Dartmouth and MP for Exeter.

A new mansion designed by Anthony Salvin (1799-1881) was built from 1828, and the old house near the church demolished on its completion in 1830.

Newman was created a baronet in 1836, while his grandson, the fourth baronet, became the first and last Baron Mamhead in 1931.

The estate continued in the family until 1985, but under the fifth baronet the house was let first as a holiday centre for evangelical clergy, and later as a school.

In 1999, it returned to being used as a private estate and has been under private ownership until it was put up for sale.
