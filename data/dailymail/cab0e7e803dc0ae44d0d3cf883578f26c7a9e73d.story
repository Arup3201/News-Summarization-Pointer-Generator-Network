The student who was beaten up in the riots and then mugged as he struggled to his feet told yesterday how his attackers – some as young as 11 – threatened to stab him.

Sickening video footage of a mob surrounding Mohammed Ashraf Haziq has been shown around the world after being posted on YouTube.

Mr Haziq, who won a scholarship to study here, relived his ordeal from his hospital bed when he was visited by a friend who filmed the chat and posted it online.

Recovering: Mr Haziq is seen in his hospital bed at Royal London 
Hospital, where he is awaiting surgery on a broken jaw after the sickening 
attack

Riot victim: Accountancy student Mohammed Ashraf Haziq, 20, had only arrived in Britain a month ago. Here he is pictured at home in Malaysia. Right he is sitting with his eight-year-old brother Mohammed Fatiri

Injuries: Mr Haziq still has facial swelling after the attack and can be seen missing several front teeth after having his jaw broken

‘They threatened to stab me, they told me they had knives,’ he says in the footage.

‘Some of them were quite young, maybe still in primary school. They had their hoods on and demanded my bicycle.’

In the YouTube video, the student, 
bloody and dazed after being punched to ground, is apparently helped to 
his feet by a Good Samaritan.

But the thugs then plunder his rucksack, 
taking his wallet, phone and Sony PSP games console.

The video was even mentioned by David Cameron yesterday.

‘When we see children as young as 13,
 looting and laughing, when we see the disgusting sight of an injured 
young man with people pretending to help him while they are robbing him,
 it is clear that there are things that are badly wrong in our society,’
 said the Prime Minister.

The 20-year-old finance student’s jaw
 was broken in the attack and he is due to have surgery at the Royal 
London Hospital in Whitechapel, East London. He also lost some of his 
teeth. His injuries mean he is unable to eat properly and he is being 
fed via a hospital drip.

At the family’s home in the affluent 
suburb of Ampang, Kuala Lumpur, his mother Maznah Abu Mansor, 47, said 
she was horrified by the attack. The mother-of-three, a school official,
 said she was ‘very sad and upset’ and appealed to the Malaysian 
government to help her to travel to London to see her son.

She said: ‘I was initially very  worried but I’m glad that he is  all right.’

Dazed and confused, blood dripping from his mouth, Ashraf Rossli is encircled by thugs after being savagely beaten to the ground during the violence in London

From nowhere, an apparent Good Samaritan walks up and lends a hand to help heave the struggling and injured victim up from the pavement

Lowest of the low: The teenager continues to tend to the wounds on his face as thieves make off with the contents of his rucksack

Lawless: A thief shamelessly rifles through Ashraf Rossli's bag as the young man stands bleeding after being punched in the face. The incident sparked national outrage

Discarded: The thief, having taken the items from the teenager's bag, then casually throws them to the floor before strolling away

Mr Haziq arrived in London last month
 to study at Kaplan College in Tower Hill, East London. He was cycling 
from his student accommodation in Barking with a friend when they saw a 
mob coming towards them.

His friend managed to escape but said
 the 20-strong gang blocked Mr Haziq’s path and knocked him to the 
ground before taking his bicycle.

He has told friends he passed out 
from the force of the blow. It was when he tried to move away that he 
was mugged. Bystander Abdul Hamid, 23, who filmed the YouTube footage, 
said: ‘I wanted to go down and help but I was terrified that I would get
 beaten up as well. There was about 50 or more of them.’

Aftermath: Mr Haziq is caught on camera moments later, standing confused and alone at the side of the street

Campaign: A website has been set up in the hope of gathering donations to make a gesture towards Ashraf Haziq after the ordeal he went through

Mr Rossli was treated at Royal London Hospital, Whitechapel, following the attack

Well-wishers are organising an appeal
 for the student, though last night it was unclear if it would be led by
 those who set up the fund website – 
http://somethingniceforashraf.tumblr.com – or by the Malaysian High 
Commission.

Former aid worker Jamie Cowen who set
 up the internet appeal insisted the money raised would go to Mr Haziq 
and any surplus would be given to ‘other London riots-related causes’.

He added: ‘I and thousands of other 
British people are disgusted that this happened in our country and want 
to do something nice for Ashraf to show to him and his country that only
 a tiny minority of us are scumbags.’

Within hours of the website launching, it had received more than 17,000 pledges of support.
