England's World Cup campaign is all but over following a 2-1 defeat to Uruguay in Sao Paulo.

The result leaves England bottom of Group D with zero points and needing Italy to win their two remaining matches and hope they can beat Costa Rica themselves on Tuesday.

Luis Suarez was Uruguay's match-winner but how did England's players fare? Sportsmail's Martin Keown returns his verdict...

Joy: Luis Suarez celebrates his winning goal during England's 2-1 victory over England

Head boy: And it was Suarez who headed Uruguay into the lead before half-time

ENGLAND (4-2-3-1)

TEAM AVERAGE 5.6

JOE HART 6

Nervous at start. Distribution good. Exposed from corners at near post and he should have sorted that.

GLEN JOHNSON 5.5

Didn’t close down Cavani for goal but made up for it with his lungbusting role in equaliser.

GARY CAHILL 6

Best of the defenders but should have gone with Suarez for second goal.

Despair: Gary Cahill is consoled by Wayne Rooney following the defeat which all but ends England's World Cup

PHIL JAGIELKA 5

Flicking at the ball rather than making proper clearances and at fault for Suarez’s first goal.

Jag's in first gear: Phil Jagielka was caught out for Luis Suarez's opening goal

LEIGHTON BAINES 5.5

The step up in class has been too quick. Finally got forward more in the second half.

STEVEN GERRARD 5.5

Crossed well for Rooney’s chance and sprayed the ball well. Poor on their goal.

Calm down: Steven Gerrard is spoken to by referee Carlos Velasco Carballo

JORDAN HENDERSON 6

An alright performance defensively. Covered a lot of ground. Used the ball well at times.

RAHEEM STERLING 5

Couldn’t get him on the ball enough. Didn’t look fit. Could have interchanged better with Rooney.

Attention: Raheem Sterling did not impact early in the game like he had against Italy

WAYNE ROONEY 6

Some poor misses but persisted and got the goal he and England so desperately craved.

At last: Wayne Rooney drew England level with his first ever World Cup goal

So close: Wayne Rooney reflects after his first-half free-kick curled narrowly wide

DANNY WELBECK 4.5

International pace but needs to link better. Comes inside a lot but never runs at his opponent.

DANIEL STURRIDGE 6.5

Lively. Our most dangerous player. Good movement but a bit wild in the final third.

SUBSTITUTES

Ross Barkley (for Sterling 64) 6At least he tried to beat men.

Adam Lallana (for Welbeck 71) 6Bright and helped spark the brief revival.

Rickie Lambert (for Henderson 84) 5Too late to make an impact

MANAGER

ROY HODGSON 5.5

Wrong to move Sterling out wide. Shouldn’t have changed his formation from the Italy game.

Knee bother: Luis Suarez was back in the Uruguay starting line-up following knee surgery

URUGUAY

TEAM AVERAGE: 6.4

(4-3-2-1): Muslera 6; Pereira 6 Gimenez 6.5, Godin 5, Caceres 6.5; Gonzalez 6 (Fucile 80), Lodeiro 6.5 (Stuani 67, 6), Arevalo 7; Rodriguez 6; Suarez 7.5 (Coates 89), Cavani 7
