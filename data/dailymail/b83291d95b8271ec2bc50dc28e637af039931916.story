Juventus striker Carlos Tevez was jeered by supporters at Old Trafford when he came on as a second-half substitute during Argentina's friendly against Portugal.

The former Manchester United striker replaced Gonzalo Higuain and was met with a chorus of boos by the Old Trafford crowd.

It comes less than a week after the 30-year-old received a hero's welcome when he returned to Upton Park as Argentina played Croatia in a friendly last Wednesday.

Tevez spent two seasons at Manchester United before a controversial move to local rivals City

The striker spent two seasons at Manchester United before quitting the club to sign for local rivals Manchester City, and some supporters in the city clearly still harbour hard feelings towards the Argentina international.

It wasn't a happy return to his old stomping ground for Tevez as an injury-time goal by Portugal's Raphael Guerreiro condemned Gerardo Martino's side to defeat.

In a match that was billed as Cristiano Ronaldo against Lionel Messi, the world's two best players were both withdrawn at half time as the game looked to be headed for a goalless draw, before Guerreiro popped up with the winner.
