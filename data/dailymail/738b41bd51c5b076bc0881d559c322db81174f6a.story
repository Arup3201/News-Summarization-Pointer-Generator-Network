Declared dead: The California court allowed Jahi McMath's parents to remove her from hospital and keep her alive elsewhere only after a coroner issued a death certificate

The mother of the 13-year-old girl at the centre of a battle to turn off her life-support machine can take her out of hospital still on a ventilator as long as she takes full responsibility for her future, a court heard today.

But the apparent breakthrough in the row over Jahi McMath was only made possible after the coroner issued a death certificate for the tragic teenager.

Alameda County Superior Court heard that Children’s Hospital, in Oakland, California, and Jahi’s family had come to an agreement over her removal to a new facility for long-term care.

The “protocol” stated that Jahi’s mother Nailah Winkfield must agree to be “wholly and exclusively responsible” for her welfare once she has been transferred into her care.

She must also provide all the necessary arrangements and hospital expertise.

But the move only happened after the Alameda County Coroner issued a death certificate – effectively allowing the hospital to release the body as if it was going for burial or cremation.

The seemingly contradictory state of affairs only re-iterates the highly unusual nature of the case, which has to date lasted more than three weeks, divided public opinion and been played out in three courts.

Jahi suffered complications following a routine operation to remove her tonsils at Children’s Hospital, in Oakland, California, on December 9.

Her heart stopped, causing brain damage that the hospital said was so severe that she was effectively dead with no chance of survival if a respirator was turned off.

Devastated: Jahi's parents arrive at court today. They are fighting to keep their 13-year-old daughter alive after she was declared brain dead following complications in routine tonsil surgery

Three doctors and the court agreed she was brain dead and the hospital applied to turn off her life support machine.

But her family, led by Mrs Winkfield and Jahi’s uncle Omari Sealey, refused to accept the prognosis and argued there was still a chance she could recover.

They said that she responded to her mother’s voice and asked that she be removed to a hospital that cared for her.

They successfully won an injunction preventing the hospital removing life support that was extended and runs out at 5pm on Tuesday.

The hospital could not agree on terms that allowed Jahi to be transferred citing ethical and legal reasons why she could not be removed.  

But now the coroner issued the certificate, they softened their approach and agreed to a path forward which had been proposed by the family’s lawyer Chris Dolan.

Hope: Jahi's family are certain that she will one day recover despite the hospital's insistence there is no chance of that happening

Now the race is on to make the arrangements before the deadline runs out on Tuesday.

'There are no winners in this,' said Sam Singer, the spokesman for the hospital.

'This young woman is dead and it is very sad.'

Doug Strauss, the lawyer for the hospital, made an emotional plea to the family to finally accept that their daughter was dead.

Mr Dolan, for the family, said that the agreed protocol was a step forward.

A spokeswoman for Alameda County Coroner confirmed that a “generic” death certificate had been issued but no details were given.

The California Department of Public Health continues its investigation into the incident.
