There’s tension in the air in Omaha.

One of Warren Buffett's ex-employees lambasted his former boss, saying his judgement day is near and that he will be judged by a higher power.

David Sokol, an executive who once seemed on-track to succeed Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway, lashed out against the 82-year-old billionaire from Omaha in a Wall Street Journal story over the weekend.

‘I will never understand why Mr. Buffett chose to hurt my family in such a way, but given that he is rapidly approaching his judgement day I will leave his verdict to a higher power,’ Sokol wrote in an emailed response to the Journal.

Bold words: 'I will never understand why Mr. Buffett chose to hurt my family in such a way, but given that he is rapidly approaching his judgement day I will leave his verdict to a higher power,' Sokol wrote to the Journal

Sokol's bold words were published nearly two years after he left Buffett's holding company over questionable stock trades and just days after his lawyer said that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission would not charge Sokol with insider trading.

Last year, following his departure from Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett called Sokol’s actions ‘inexplicable and inexcusable.’

It is uncommon for a former employee to lash out against Buffett, who is often referred to as the 'Oracle of Omaha' for his savvy investing decisions.

The self-made billionaire is generally well respected by his his executives and ‘gives them lots of room to manage their companies,’ the Journal reported.

Buffet is also well regarded in the financial community, with investors, financial media personalities and politicians often praising his ideas.

Sokol, an Omaha native like Buffett, was at one point in the Buffett-loving camp. But that changed when he resigned in March 2011.

Buffett had formerly called Sokol ‘an enormously talented builder and operator.’

Sokol, who was born in 1956, went on to start a private equity firm called Teton Capital after leaving Berkshire Hathaway.

Sokol has stated that he has no plans to rekindle his relationship with Buffett anytime soon, according to Fox Business.

‘I haven’t spoken to Warren and I don’t want to...the notion that I violated some company policy is absurd,’ he told the conservative news network owned by Rupert Murdoch.
