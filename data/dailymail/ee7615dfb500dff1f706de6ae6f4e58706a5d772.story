Anyone who fears music is becoming more foul-mouthed should watch out for Scarlett-Rose Davis.

The three-year-old - who became an internet hit for screaming 'f****** hell!' during the ice bucket challenge - is set to audition as a tiny rapper on Britain’s Got Talent.

Angel-faced Scarlett's profane outburst was captured on video and viewed more than 100,000 times after her grandfather Stuart, 33, uploaded it to YouTube.

Potty mouth: Three-year-old Scarlett-Rose Davis turned the air blue during an ice bucket challenge - and her doting grandparents have now revealed she intends to try out for Britain's Got Talent as a rapper

The video captures the moment the little girl stomps off after her icy challenge - exclaiming 'f***ing hell'

Today Scarlett's grandmother Carla Davis-Ball, 40, said the toddler wanted to be a rapper or a singer and hoped her internet fame would help her pursue a career in the music business.

It was Mrs Davis-Ball who helped pour a pot of warm water over Scarlett's head as part of the challenge, which has raised more than £3.2million for the Motor Neurone Disease Association.

'Scarlett has loved the attention since the video has gone around the world,' she said.

'She might be just three but she already knows what she wants. She would love to be a singer or a rapper. We’re going to try and get her on Britain’s Got Talent.

'She might try out as a rapper but she’ll have to watch her language considering it’s a family show!'

Scarlett begged her grandparents to take part in the challenge. They agreed but insisted on warm water

Polite: Mrs Davis-Ball joked the three-year-old would have to watch her language on the television show

She added: 'I think she’d do well on the show, she’s got great stage presence and is confident as anything.

'I’ve been on the Britain’s Got Talent website and I’m putting her name down. I know the auditions start next year.

'I would do it for her. I would do anything for her.

'She
 often sings Let it Go off the film Frozen and Eye of the Tiger. She 
doesn’t know all the words yet but we’re getting there.'

Scarlett begged her 
grandparents to let her take part in the ice bucket challenge and they 
agreed only if they could use warm water.

Now say sorry! Mrs Davis-Ball tells her granddaughter to apologise for using the bad language

Mrs Davis-Ball previously said she was horrified at the child's foul language - but nearly died with laughter.

'I couldn't believe it,' she said. 'She has picked up a few bad words when we have gone out for meals or into town.

'It did shock me but she's so clever I'm not surprised she's picked it up. We told her it was a naughty word.

'Children have brains like sponges and I can't stop it. But she does know it's wrong.

In
 an odd coincidence, Scarlett-Rose’s cousin Kelly Peakman also ran into 
hot water when she auditioned for the X Factor and branded the judges 
'w******'.

Kelly turned the air blue after she belted out I Will Always Love You by Whitney Houston in 2007.

Worldwide: Mr Ball said the response  was 'overwhelming', with people viewing the clip in America and China

Picture of innocence: But the three-year-old's granddaughter said she knows what she wants - fame

The
 then-23-year-old rated her voice as a perfect ten, but acid-tongued 
Simon Cowell said she sounded 'like a dog barking' and rated her singing
 skills at just two-and-a-half 'at best'.

Scarlett-Rose was not the youngest person to take the ice bucket challenge.

A
 video of a seven-month-old baby having a small plastic cup of water 
poured over its head was also posted on YouTube earlier this month.

The
 craze has raised more than £3million for the Motor Neurone Disease 
Association in Britain and more than £50million for the Amyotrophic 
Lateral Sclerosis Association in the U.S.

They are different names for the same condition which affects the brain and the spinal cord, causing motor neurones 
to degenerate and die, leading to gradual paralysis and eventually 
death.

The craze in Britain has also raised more than £3million for the cancer charity Macmillan.
