A pub DJ and father-of-two was left scarred for life by a heckler who glassed him after he changed the words to an Elvis Presley song during a karaoke night.

Richard Sykes, 36, was singing a comedy version of 'I Just Can't Help Believing' at a pub when customer David Watson took offence.

Watson, 43, started heckling Mr Sykes and his singing partner before trying to pull the wires out of the karaoke machine at the Jug and Barrel Pub in Stanningley, Leeds, West Yorks.

But when Mr Sykes tried to stop him, Watson, of Leeds, West Yorks., smashed the pint glass into his face.

Mr Sykes, also of Leeds, spent three days in Leeds General Infirmary and has 42 stitches in four wounds.

Watson was handed an 11-month jail sentence suspended for 18 months plus 180 hours of unpaid work by a judge at Leeds Crown Court last week.

The court heard Watson was angry after claiming Mr Sykes' singing partner had changed the words of the song to reveal information about Watson, which he believed only a handful of people knew.

But Mr Sykes said: 'I had never met him before in my life, neither had the friend I was singing with.

He said the reason it happened is because we released sensitive information about him but we didn't know the guy.

'I do a comedy Elvis show and it was just a song I sing from time to time on my karaoke.'

Mr Sykes said he is struggling to complete his mobile DJ gigs since the attack last May, adding: 'I just can't face standing up there alone in front of strange crowds. I feel scared and I just can't be my normal self.

'I have spent 18 months trying to work out why it happened.'

Watson's lawyer Sean Smith told the court last week that the singer was 'making up his own words in a derogatory nature against the defendant'.

Mr Smith said: 'He was surprised to know how the individual with the microphone got hold of that information.'

Prosecuting, Stephanie Hancock said the incident had a devastating impact on Mr Sykes' life, adding: 'He feels what happens on that evening has made him a different person entirely.

'He has lost motivation for doing day to day things and has suffered with bouts of depression.'

Miss Hancock said Mr Sykes used to work regularly as a DJ, but since the attack has only done so on a handful of occasions.

She added: 'He just didn't have the nerve to stand up there alone.'

The Recorder of Leeds, Judge Peter Collier QC also ordered Watson, who admitted wounding, to pay £196 compensation to Mr Sykes and £1,200  towards prosecution costs.
