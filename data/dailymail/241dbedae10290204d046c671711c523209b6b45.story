Winston Churchill’s great-grandson took the fight to Downing Street yesterday to demand that all Afghan interpreters who have fought alongside British forces since war in the country began should be offered asylum.

Alexander Perkins, who completed two tours in Afghanistan as a captain in the Scots Guards, said the interpreters will be ‘sent to their death’ if not offered sanctuary  in the UK.

The Government has offered a five-year visa to 600 Afghan interpreters who were made redundant after last December and had served for a year or more on the frontline with the Army.

But many officers say this leaves 
about 2,000 who served on the frontline between 2001 and last year not 
eligible and therefore at risk of revenge attacks by the Taliban when 
troops pull out next year.

Former Captain Perkins says his great-grandfather Winston Churchill would have looked at the plight of the Afghan interpreters from 'a soldiers perspective'

Yesterday, Mr Perkins led a group of 
veterans to deliver a petition with 53,000 signatures to David Cameron, 
demanding all former interpreters are included in the scheme.

The 27-year-old helped start the 
campaign after his own interpreter, Baryalai Shams, 26, who he served 
alongside in Helmand in 2008 and 2009, was refused leave to enter 
Britain to claim asylum.

Mr Perkins, who has left the Army and 
is working on fuel projects in Africa, said: ‘My great-grandfather 
Winston Churchill, who spent a large part of his career in the Army, 
would have been shocked by the way our Government is treating men who 
risked their lives to help British forces.

‘The interpreters took great risks to 
help us, putting not only their lives but the lives of their families in
danger of Taliban reprisals.’

A total of 26 Afghan interpreters have been killed in action alongside British troops and another 150 wounded.

The campaign in support of the 
interpreters has won the support of senior politicians and former 
generals, including Lord Ashdown, David Davis MP, General Sir Mike 
Jackson and General Lord Dannatt.

A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘The 
Prime Minister has been very clear that we should not turn our backs on 
our local staff in Afghanistan.

‘Any local employees who have worked 
for the British government regardless of date and duration are offered a
range of protection measures.’
