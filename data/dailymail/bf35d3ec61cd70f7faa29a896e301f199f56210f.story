This is the adorable moment a tiny kitten stands up to a massive doberman dog in British Columbia, Canada.

The charming scene was captured on video by the kitten's owners Jessica Manning and her boyfriend Ryan Onsowich.

The pair found the two-month-old kitten abandoned in a petrol station's toilet.

Ms Manning, who is a customs officer, filmed the encounter between tiny Sophie and her three-year-old doberman, Bishop.

At one point, Sophie rears up on her back legs and strikes the massive doberman on the hose.

Ms Manning said: Jessica said: 'Sophie has a lot of attitude - but she's also a cuddle monster

'Bishop's behavior has been excellent - I couldn't have imagined he would be so patient.

'He just wants to make friends with her but she's still getting to grips with him.'

But despite the duo's stand-off, Ms Manning hopes the pair will quickly become firm friends.
