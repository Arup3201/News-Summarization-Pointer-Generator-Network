A four-year-old Colorado girl wept on Tuesday due to her mounting frustration over the seemingly endless presidential campaign.

Fort Collins mother Elizabeth Evans uploaded a video of her daughter's teary-eyed plea in which the youngster said she was crying because of 'Bronco Bamma and Mitt Romney.'

The mother said that the duo had been on their way to the grocery store listening to an election story on National Public Radio when the waterworks went off.

In the video, Mrs Evans asks her red-eyed daughter why she is crying.

'I'm tired of Bronco Bamma and Mitt Romney,' Abigael responds.

Tears stream down her face and she pulls at her hair, clearly distraught by the barrage of information she's endured.

Mrs Evans reassured her daughter that the end of the election was in sight.

'Don't worry it will be over soon,' she said. 'It will be over soon.'

Mrs Evans found the situation remarkable and took a 22 second video of the girl.

Viewers have found the video both endearing and telling.

'I don't blame you for crying Abby. I am tired of it too,' YouTube user lightnbubbly said.

'Poor little child, bless her heart. I'm sick of hearing about those two as well,' bluntforcetrauma492 added.

Mrs Evans told 9News that after the pair finished their grocery shopping, she switched the radio from NPR to Neil Young.

'If I knew where to send it, I would send Abby a teddy bear. She deserves it,' oldvagabond44 promised.
