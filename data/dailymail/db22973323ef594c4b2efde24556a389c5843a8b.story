Armed and ready, this family is well equipped to defend their right to bear arms.

Six-year-olds Raealonie and Charlisse Evans are as comfortable with a .22 rifle as they are playing with dolls.

Both sisters, like their siblings, Verenise, 14, Roberto, 12, Celeste, 10, have their own weapons and regularly practise using them.

One Direction fan Verenise is looking forward to learning how to shoot a 12-gauge shotgun.

'When you pull the trigger I like the rush you get,' she explains. 'It's just adrenaline.'

But
 10-year-old Celeste, who prefers Taylor Swift, favours a semi-automatic
 rifle: 'You don't have to do something every time you shoot around. You
 can shoot ten at a time.'

Despite a recent wave of gun tragedies in the U.S., including the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting, their father, Treves, 37, believes more firearms are the answer.

He said: 'With all the recent shootings I feel that armed citizens are a good line of defence.

'Most of those shootings that have occurred, when they were confronted they either surrendered or shot themselves. More guns, less crime.'

And in the Evans household, getting to grips with potentially deadly weapons is actively encouraged.Â

While most parents would be terrified of such young children playing with the lethal weapons truck driver Treves is thrilled.

He even drills his young family in how to use firearms - in case someone should try to take them away.

Treves from Kent, Washington, also identifies with the militia movement, set up to protect the country from a rogue government.

And that includes filling his home with an arsenal of 15 weapons - including daughter Raealonie's pink hunting rifle.

Treves even has a license to carry a concealed weapon when he's not at work.

Treves said: 'The second amendment is a second line of defence against foreign invasion and a last line of defence against your own government.

'I want my kids to know how to handle guns in the event that they need them.'

But while the children have access to an arsenal of guns, Treves believes education is paramount to developing a healthy respect for the weapons.

He said: 'The first thing is to teach them gun safety and the next thing is to let them handle a gun.

'There's no mystery with my children - it's not forbidden. They're not going to sneak in when I'm not home and pull out guns.'

Treves and wife Rosanna, 39, are also preppers, who are prepared to survive in the wilderness should they need to leave home at a moments notice.

And the patriotic couple want to teach their children to stand-up for their freedoms.

Treves said: 'I feel the freedom in our country is being eroded away - they'll just be eroded at until there are none.

'That's why I don't give anything when it comes to the second amendment.

'It's our right and we're gong to exercise our right.'

And Treves points the finger at liberal politicians using shooting tragedies such as last year's Sandy Hook massacre to push for tighter control on guns.

He said: 'If I give something now, the next time there's an unfortunate incident they're gonna want something else and pretty soon there wont be anything left.'
