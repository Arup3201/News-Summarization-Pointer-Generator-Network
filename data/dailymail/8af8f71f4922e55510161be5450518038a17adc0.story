Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, pictured leaving his house this morning, is assessing the damage to the Lib Dems' local government base

Nick
 Clegg today refused to resign as Lib Dem leader after losing control of some of his party's flagship councils.

The Lib Dems were ousted from Portsmouth after a surge of support for Ukip while the Tories took control of Kingston-upon-Thames - the local authority of Energy Secretary Ed Davey. 

A rare glimmer of good news came in Eastleigh, where the Lib Dems have tightened their grip on the local authority after successfully defending the parliamentary seat in a by-election last year.

Mr Clegg conceded that his party had suffered at the hands of a Ukip surge, blaming a 'very strong anti-politics feeling among the public.

But he added: 'Actually I think in the areas where we have MPs where we have good organisation on the ground... we are actually doing well.'

The Lib Dems are are on course to lose around 300 seats. 

Earlier Lib Dem minister Lynne Featherstone said her party had lost its ‘humanity’ in office.

‘Ukip
 have managed to sound like human beings – that’s Nigel Farage’s big 
win,’ she told the BBC. ‘All of us have become so guarded, we are so 
on-message that we seem to have lost some of our humanity.

‘The
 Lib Dems are the whipping boys in the coalition. In the last general 
election debates Nick came across as the human being… Partly being in 
government, we have become more ministerial, we have become more 
political. We have lost some of the humanity Nick had four years ago.’

With
 rumours swirling of a leadership plot, Mr Clegg has urged his party not
 to ‘lose its nerve’ just as the Government’s key decisions are being 
‘vindicated’.

Mr Clegg told reporters it was 'never easy' seeing 'dedicated, hard-working' councillors kicked out.

But he said he would 'absolutely not' resign, and insisted the Lib Dems were still succeeding where they focused on their achievements in coalition.

'Based on the results which have come in so far, it has obviously been a mixed result, a mixed night for my party, for the Liberal Democrats and the other mainstream parties,' Mr Clegg said.

'We will see what the further results today, what story they tell. But so far what I have seen is that where we can work really hard to tell our side of the story, we can win.'

He added: 'I certainly accept that there is a very strong anti-politics mood around, not only in our country but in many other parts of Europe as well. I think you will see that in European elections in the days to come...

'There is a very strong mood of restlessness and dissatisfaction with mainstream politics and that is reflected in the results for all mainstream parties, including the Lib Dems.'

Mr Clegg is under fresh pressure, with the Lib Dems braced to lose many of their MEPs when the European election results emerge on Sunday night

WINS: Did well in Eastleigh - stopping Ukip from taking any seats on council.

LOSSES: Portsmouth slipped into no overall control, as Ukip took four seats.

Tories took overall control of Kingston-upon-Thames.

Labour took Cambridge. 

Deputy Leader of the Liberal Democrats Sir Malcolm Bruce played down his party's losses and stressed it intended to be a 'major force' in British politics for the foreseeable future.

He told BBC Breakfast: 'It is obviously disappointing to lose councillors, particularly those who have worked hard in their community and may have been replaced by those who haven't got a track record.

'But actually we are pleased that where we have targeted our resources, particularly in held seats or key seats, we have actually had very good results.

'That's really very important for us. Getting an even share across the country doesn't deliver seats, getting them in the seats that matter is what matters to us.' 

Senior party 
figures dismiss ideas that Mr Clegg could be replaced by Danny Alexander or 
Vince Cable, but are preparing for a bumpy few weeks if the results are 
bad. In several European election polls, the party has been languishing 
in fifth place behind the Greens.

A
 poll suggests that only 46 per cent of Lib Dem voters would want Mr 
Clegg to stay in his job if the party ends up in that position. 

David 
Cameron and senior Tories, however, are said to be planning a ‘Save 
Clegg’ operation that will see the Lib Dems given ‘wins’ in the 
forthcoming Queen’s Speech.

Lib
 Dem sources insisted their vote was holding up well in their 
Parliamentary seats, and that both the Tories and Labour were falling 
short of the sort of results they need to demonstrate if they want to 
win a majority next year.
