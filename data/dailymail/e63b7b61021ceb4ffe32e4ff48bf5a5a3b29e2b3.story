A woman who developed anorexia during her first year of university - and at her lowest point didn't care if she lived or died - has turned her life around by putting on three stone, and is now a finalist in a lingerie modelling competition for curvy women.

Alice Jackson, 26, suffered from depression shortly after beginning her retail course at Bournemouth University in 2006.

The London-based fashion researcher became obsessed with her weight and went running for up to two hours every day, eating just a handful of lettuce leaves at night.

Her weight plummeted from 9st 11lbs to a dangerously low 7st 10lbs in just three months - four stone below the recommended healthy weight for her 5ft 9ins frame - and she shrunk to a size six dress size.

Alice finally decided to get help after her parents told her she was too thin when she returned home to Norwich in June 2006.

Her university GP referred her to a hospital who confirmed she was anorexic, and she spent a year receiving counselling with the Somerset and Wessex Eating Disorders Association (SWEDA), eventually getting back to a healthy weight.

Alice now weighs 11 stone and has been chosen as a finalist for fuller-figure lingerie firm Curvy Kate's annual 'Star in a Bra' competition after her friends entered her into the contest.

Alice, pictured left in 2007, says during her illness she was so thin she could feel all her bones when she lay in bed at night, but now, right, she is body-confident and happy with her size

Alice, who has a 30FF bust, said: 'It started when I was in my first year of university when I was 18. I started to put on a lot of weight and wasn't confident so I went home at Christmas and decided to go on a diet.

'It spiralled into cutting down my food and over-exercising, and before I knew it I was eating very little. I was controlled by not eating so my weight went down pretty rapidly.

'When I got to June and I was doing Race for Life, my parents were like "you're too thin, you need to see someone".

'I didn't feel well, I felt really ill and had no energy because I was eating so little and starving myself and over-exercising so running on empty.

That was a really difficult summer. It's a horrible thing to be trapped in your thoughts about food and weight. I felt really really depressed and I didn't care if I died, I just felt awful, all I could think about was food and calories.'

Alice's friends entered her into Curvy Kate's annual lingerie competition, and she was surprised when she was shortlisted

During the height of her eating disorder Alice admits that she so depressed from constant calorie-counting that she didn't care if she died, but is now so happy with her curves that she allowed friends to enter her into a lingerie modelling competition

At the hospital doctors told Alice she would only feel better if she began eating properly, so Alice took their advice and started taking better care of herself, reaching a healthy weight by the end of her second year of university.

She said: 'By the end I had got to a healthy weight. I was still slim but I wasn't controlled by calories.'

Alice during her battle with anorexia

Alice, who lives in London and is single, has worked in the fashion industry as a footwear researcher for the last 15 months.

She said: 'My weight has gone up gradually but I've been at 11 stones for a good year and a half. I feel happy with myself, my body feels like it's at its natural shape.

'When I was anorexic I used to lie in bed and could feel all my bones. It was just a really horrible time to be so trapped, I thought I would never get better.

'It's so nice to be able to eat again and to be able to have things because I was so strict with myself before.

'There's a lot of things I didn't eat, I didn't eat chocolate at all and never had bread either. But I love chocolate now, it's my favourite thing to have as a treat.

'I am confident in my body and being healthy and I think it's really important women don't keep feeling dissatisfied with themselves because people tell them to lose half a pound. I'm happy to be curvy and I'm proud to be curvy - and I think that's important.'

Alice is up against 30 other curvy 
models competing in an online vote to be crowned the new model who will 
sport next year's range of Curvy Kate underwear. The winner will be announced later
this year.

Alice says she now feels body-confident, and happy that her life is not ruled by constant dieting and calorie-counting
