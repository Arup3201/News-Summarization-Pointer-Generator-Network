Friends of Philip Vassallo gathered at the crash scene where they left flowers and hand written notes

A Sydney teenager who was tragically killed when his car collided with a ute in Sydney's western suburbs had a passion for cars, but loved none more than the one he died in - his refurbished Nissan Datsun.

Friends of Phillip Vassallo, 17, say they are in disbelief over the tragic crash which claimed the life of the popular teenager on Friday night and left his passenger, friend Justin Galea, with severe injuries.

Police said the Penrith road where the teenager died is a popular street racing circuit, but friends - including one who said he saw the tragedy unfold - said Philip was not speeding or taking part in the illegal activity before he died.

A police spokeswoman wouldn't comment on whether speeding or street racing was a factor, but an earlier police statement confirmed Philip was killed when his car collided with a HiLux utilitiy both travelling east along Andrews Road.

It is understood he was performing a U-Turn outside the place he worked before crashing.

Police are investigating whether the vehicle he spent his money, heart and soul on, was  modified with a high-performance engine that would would have made it illegal for him as a provisional licence holder to drive.

But despite this his friend Andrew Xiberras, who said witnessed one of his 'best mates pass away,'  took to Facebook to dispel any suggestion that Philip was speeding.

'Take it from the person who saw one of his best mates pass away. There was no street racing or drinking while we were out,' Adrian Xiberras wrote on Facebook.

Another told media at the scene that Philip wouldn't put his life in jeopardy because he 'didn't want anything to happen' to the beloved Datsun he was driving.

'I never knew him to be a silly driver because he loved that car so much and didn't want anything to happen to it,' Angus Erhl said.

Philip's own personal profile, and many other comments relating to the news of his death, have been flooded with love hearts and messages of disbelief.

'You were only seventeen, taken way to soon buddy. We remember you as that bubbly, kind hearted, outgoing boy. You will be dearly missed,' Lauren Xerri wrote.

Those close to the 17-year-old also gathered at the scene of the accident on Saturday laying flowers and writing messages of love and support.

A group of school friends sat silently at the scene, coming to terms with the tragic circumstances which claimed the life of their young friend and lover of all things motor vehicles just hours earlier.

The Sun Herald reported that Philip was a second year apprentice who spent the money he earned on his Datsun.  His friends posted a photo on social media of them holding up car parts along a blue Datsun ute.

Police Inspector Mark Cook said the crash was a clear reminder to young motorists, of which 35 between 17 and 25 have died on NSW roads this year, to take care.

'They need to take their time, be rested, not travel too close and don't use a mobile phone or text or even drink and drive,' he told The Sun Herald.
