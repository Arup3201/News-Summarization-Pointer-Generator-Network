It was a hectic summer of comings and goings at Old Trafford, with the deadwood quickly being shifted out to make way for the exciting and expensive new acquisitions demanded by Louis van Gaal.

But is there life after Manchester United? We have a look at how those who departed have been faring at their new clubs in the early part of the season.

DANNY WELBECK (Sold to Arsenal on deadline day for £16m)

No two ways about it, Welbeck looks a new player since swapping Old Trafford for the Emirates. Revitalised and rejuventated, the England striker has scored four goals in his first five matches for the Gunners and looks to be enjoying his football again. 

Danny Welbeck has enjoyed a new lease of life after leaving Manchester United for Arsenal 

Welbeck scored a hat-trick in Arsenal's 4-1 win over Galatasaray in the Champions League on Wednesday 

Welbeck's move made perfect sense, with United bringing in Radamel Falcao and captain Wayne Rooney undroppable, he was going to rot if he remained. At Arsenal, he has game time and a fresh sense of purpose. 

Wenger said his performance against Galatasaray on Wednesday, in which he scored his first ever hat-trick, was 'electric' and more goals appear inevitable. 8/10

RIO FERDINAND (Released; joined Queens Park Rangers in July)

The vastly experienced centre back, 35, was not expected to play a great deal in United's defence this season and his 12 years of service at Old Trafford came to an end.

As it happens, Van Gaal could have done with Rio after a debilitating injury crisis left him desperately short at the back. The former England man may not have been the solution, however, judging by the poor start he has made at Loftus Road. 

QPR have conceded 13 goals in the six matches Ferdinand has featured. He was at fault for their opening day defeat by Hull when he allowed James Chester to score the winner from a corner and he was tormented by Peter Crouch in the 2-2 draw with Stoke a fortnight ago.4/10

NEMANJA VIDIC (Joined Inter Milan on a free transfer in July)

Vidic, 32, insisted his summer move to Italy was a 'step forward' in his career but things didn't get off to the best of starts. He endured a nightmare debut at Torino, conceding a penalty in the first half before being sent off late on for sracasticaly applauding the referee. 

After serving a one-match suspension, Vidic returned against Palermo but was caught out just three minutes in, losing the ball to Franco Vazquez who went on to score. 

And things didn't get much better in Sunday's 4-1 home defeat by Cagliari as the Inter defence was ripped open time after time. Vidic also conceded a penalty when he hauled down Marco Sau. 4/10

SHINJI KAGAWA (Joined Borussia Dortmund for an undisclosed fee in August)

On the scrapheap at Old Trafford, Kagawa made a wise decision and returned to the club where he made his name - Borussia Dortmund. He immediately reminded the 'Yellow Wall' what they'd been missing with a goal against Freiburg on his first match back and has been pretty good since. 

He showed something like his best form in Dortmund's 3-0 Champions League win over Anderlecht on Wednesday, setting up two goals and showing the kind of incisive passing that persuaded United to sign him in the first place. 

Sir Alex Ferguson admitted to Jurgen Klopp that he failed with Kagawa but it looks like he is now slowly returning to his full ability. 7/10

PATRICE EVRA (Sold to Juventus for £1.2m in July)

With the big money arrival of Luke Shaw, Evra's opportunities, like those of Vidic and Ferdinand, appeared limited and he moved on to Juventus. 

The Frenchman, 33, has made a good start to his career in Italy, helping his new team to four consecutive clean sheets in Serie A and the Champions League. They were finally breached by Atletico Madrid on Wednesday night, suffering a 1-0 defeat. 

Evra has claimed that the move has reawoken a sense of sacrifice for the cause that had gone missing at Old Trafford. He told Italian newspaper La Repubblica: 'Now there are so many strong players, but I do not know if they are for Manchester - for this club you have to sacrifice everything. That is the culture that I have rediscovered at Juve.' 8/10

TOM CLEVERLEY (Loaned to Aston Villa)

Cleverley admitted he would have to leave Old Trafford to shake off the negativity that has surrounded him over the last two years and he's started well enough at Villa. His debut came in a 1-0 win over Liverpool at Anfield and manager Paul Lambert described his display as 'fantastic.' 

Back-to-back 3-0 losses to Arsenal and Chelsea were less encouraging but Cleverley has the perfect chance to rebuild his reputation at Villa Park. 6/10

JAVIER HERNANDEZ (Loaned to Real Madrid)

Like Welbeck, Chicharito knew he would only get a regular run of games away from Old Trafford. To that end, Real Madrid wasn't the obvious destination but he's done fairly well so far.

Hernandez has been a popular addition with fans and team-mates alike and he opened his account with two goals in the 8-2 win over Deportivo. 

His role will continue to be making an impact from the bench but Carlo Ancelotti did start him against Ludogorets in the Champions League. Unfortunately, he missed a really good close-range chance and Karim Benzema, the man who replaced him in the second-half, went on to score the winner. 7/10

NANI (Loaned to Sporting Lisbon)

With little to no chance of playing for United this season, Nani returned to Sporting. He's certainly been playing more and even scoring - against Maribor in the Champions League and against Gil Vicente in the Portuguese league. But the club's form has been disappointing and they sit seventh in the table after 10 games. 

Nani missed a penalty against Arouca during his first game back and was involved in a bizarre incident against Belenenses when he and Jefferson tries to carry off an opponent they believed was play-acting late in the game, leading to the latter getting sent off. 5/10

WILFRIED ZAHA (Loaned to Crystal Palace)

The 'forgotten one' under David Moyes, Zaha wasn't likely to fare much better under Van Gaal and returned to Crystal Palace to try and salvage his talent. He started well enough, scoring the Eagles' last-minute equaliser in a 3-3 draw at Newcastle United. 

He has since started in the goalless draw with Burnley and the Capital One Cup loss to Newcastle. Zaha seems to be slowly but surely rediscovering his touch but a permanent move away from United would be sensible. 7/10

ALEXANDER BUTTNER (Sold to Dynamo Moscow for £4.4m in June)

United got a decent price for the long-forgotten left-back and the 25-year-old is seeking to resurrect his career in the Russian capital. He has started seven matches this season but expressed his exasperation that all anyone wants to talk about is his time at United. 6/10

FEDERICO MACHEDA (Joined Cardiff City on a free in July)

One-week wonder Macheda had spent most of his Old Trafford career on loan and was only likely to flourish if he moved away permanently. He is featuring for Cardiff but his only two goals so far came at Port Vale in the Capital One Cup. 4/10

BEBE (Sold to Benfica for £2.4m)

Arguably the biggest flop of the Ferguson era, Bebe finally left the club for Benfica over the summer. He scored on his debut as Benfica beat Rio Ave to win the Supercup but hasn't played since. 2/10
