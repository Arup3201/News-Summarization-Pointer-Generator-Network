Celebrity chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall has been forced to drop his campaign to encourage the nation to eat more mackerel - after it emerged that it is being over-fished.

Mackerel has become a firm favourite after a string of endorsements from celebrity chefs, including ‘real food’ champion Fearnley-Whittingstall.

They have stressed its relatively cheap price tag and high levels of omega 3 oils - known to improve brain function.

But consumers are now being told it is no longer a sustainable choice of fish.

Change of mind: TV chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall has been forced to drop his campaign to get people to eat more mackerel after it emerged that it is being over-fished

Scientists warn that catches of mackerel should be slashed to almost half the levels of 2011.

It has now been removed from the Marine Conservation Society’s ‘fish to eat’ list, and instead should only be consumed occasionally, joining the likes of monkfish and plaice.

After campaigning for the wider use of mackerel as part of his Fish Fight series, celebrity chef Fearnley-Whittingstall says he will end his campaign to see the nation eating it regularly - including trying to convince fish and chip shops to sell mackerel in a bap or and will himself be using the fish more sparingly.

Last year, sales of smoked mackerel leapt by 20 per cent compared to 2011 at middle-class favourite Waitrose.

Conservationists now fear stocks may be at risk after Iceland and the Faroe Islands dramatically increased their quotas in recent years.

In 2011, 930,000 tonnes of mackerel were fished from the north-east Atlantic, but scientists claim the maximum that should be caught is 542,000 tonnes.

Fishing grounds: Mackerel may seem plentiful in places, but it is fast disappearing from our shores

Reacting
to the announcement that mackerel is at risk, Fearnley-Whittingstall 
said: ‘When we started the mac bap campaign two years ago, mackerel was 
certified as sustainable and part of a well-managed fishery.

‘Unfortunately
things have changed, and politics and greed are getting in the way of 
common sense. If the countries involved could agree sensible catch 
limits this could still be a certified sustainable fishery.

‘We
hope that these so called mackerel wars can be laid to rest as soon as 
possible, so we can all go back to eating mackerel again with a clear 
conscience.’

In demand: In 2011, 930,000 tonnes of mackerel were fished from the north-east Atlantic, but scientists claim the maximum that should be caught is 542,000 tonnes

He promised to only use 
handline-caught mackerel, which is considered the most sustainable, in 
his River Cottage restaurants and cooking school.

Michelin-starred chef Raymond Blanc 
described the plight of mackerel as ‘horrible’ adding that its decline 
is ‘clearly is an example of the failure of politics’.

Bernadette
Clarke, fisheries officer at the Marine Conservation Society (MCS), 
said good alternatives to mackerel - worth £205 million to the British 
fishing industry in 2011 - are herring and sardine.

‘Iceland and the Faroe Islands have unilaterally decided to take a larger share than before. As a result, there is a real potential for overfishing,’ she said.

Mackerel may well be a victim of its own success following campaigns to encourage people to switch to the fish.

‘People are more aware that eating fish can boost their health, and particularly oily types like mackerel,’ said Miss Clarke.

‘And Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and the mackerel bap has certainly contributed to its popularity.’

A Defra spokesperson said: 'The continued sustainability of mackerel is vitally important and is increasingly threatened by the actions of the Faroe Islands and Iceland.

'We are extremely concerned that an agreement on fishing rights has not yet been reached.

'That is why the UK continues to seek a new agreement that is fair to all.'

Other fish taken off the ‘fish to eat’ list is gurnard and pollock - a white fish once championed as a sustainable alternative to cod.

Both species have increased in popularity, while there is a lack of data on population levels and concerns about how stocks are being managed.

Gurnard, which has been historically 
caught accidentally as ‘bycatch’, has become fashionable in restaurants 
in recent years, with its sustainable virtues praised by celebrity 
chefs.

But with increased 
consumption and up to 50 per cent of the catch discarded by fishermen, 
scientists fear it could soon be at risk.

To
add to the confusion, despite concerns over cod and haddock stocks, 
they are on the ‘fish to eat’ list if they come from areas where numbers
are sustainable.

‘It is 
difficult for the consumer because a lot of the supermarket labeling is 
inadequate for them to make a properly informed choice. The advice is to
check where the fish comes from if possible,’ said the MSC.

The latest version of the ‘fish to eat' list shows that herring stocks, coley and Dover sole from the English Channel are all good to eat with a clear conscience.

Whiting from the Celtic Sea also appears on the list for the first time, while a number of other popular wild fish are given the green light to appear on the dinner plate, including lemon sole.

And farmed species are on the list, including organic Arctic charr, sturgeon caviar from closed fish farming systems, mussels, tiger prawns, Atlantic halibut and salmon and rainbow trout.
