More than 90 tons of ready-to-eat salads and sandwiches produced by a California catering company have been recalled after 26 people in three states were sickened by a bacterial strain of E. coli linked to its products, federal health officials said Sunday.

Richmond-based Glass Onion Catering is recalling approximately 181,620 pounds of salads and sandwich wraps containing cooked chicken and ham that may be contaminated with the bacteria, the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said.

The products were produced between September 23 and November 6, and were shipped to distribution centers in California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Texas.

Of the 26 people infected, 15 reported consuming pre-packaged salads before they became ill.The FSIS says the bacteria can cause dehydration, bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps two to eight days after being exposed to it. While most people recover within a week, some develop kidney failure. This condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children under five years old and older adults.

In the United States, HUS is the principal cause of acute kidney failure in children, and most cases of HUS are caused by E. coli O157:H7.
