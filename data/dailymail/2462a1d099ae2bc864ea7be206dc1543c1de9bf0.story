Manchester United legend Paul McGrath has offered to help Louis van Gaal plug his leaky defence after another calamitous display on Monday night.

The former  Republic of Ireland defender aged 54, was stunned by United's defensive frailties as they twice went behind at West Bromwich Albion.

Paul McGrath reckons United's defending is so bad even he could do better at 54

First Stephane Sessegnon and then Saido Berahino took advantage of loose defending to beat David de Gea at The Hawthorns. 

McGrath tweeted: 'Very disappointed with Man United tonight, thought they might get the 3 points but defensive problems are still glaringly obvious!

'Going to try get myself fit and get back into that Defence!! Man United all over the place.'

Sub Marouane Fellaini's first goal since his £27.5m from Everton last year and an 87th-minute strike from Daley Blind rescued a point for United.

Sixth-placed United have won only three of their opening eight games and face leaders Chelsea and Manchester City in their next two Premier League games.
