Defensive lineman Montori Hughes has taken extended leave from the Indianapolis Colts after the sudden death of his three-month-old daughter.

Coach Chuck Pagano revealed at a media conference on Thursday that Maveah Alice Hughes, Hughes' daughter with girlfriend Leigh Burton, died suddenly last week following an illness.

He explained that Hughes had brought Maveah to training camp at Anderson University earlier this month and the infant 'was perfectly fine'.

But she became ill and passed away last week, he explained, Fox59 reported.

'I can't imagine,' he said. 'No parent should have to bury a child. We all go through circumstances. This is an extremely, extremely difficult time for Montori and his family.' 

Just weeks ago, proud dad Montori was pictured carrying Maveah as he introduced her to Colts owner Jim Irsay and quarterback Andrew Luck during training practice. 

The team released no further details about the cause of the little girl's death.

On Facebook, Montori's relatives from back home in Tennessee shared beautiful pictures of the little girl, while friends passed on their prayers to Hughes. 

Pagano added: 'We've got his back and wevll get through this thing as a family like we get through anything. I just ask you guys, like along with us, just to keep Montori and his family in your thoughts and prayers.'

The football player, a 2013 fifth-round draft pick, appeared in four games as a rookie and finished with seven tackles.
