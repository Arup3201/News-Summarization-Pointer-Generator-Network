A starving four-month-old foal was left to die alone in freezing conditions after being dumped near a caravan park.

The sweet piebald cob called Gizmo is battling to survive after he was found without his mother and seriously underweight near Ridgewell Caravan Park in Essex on Tuesday.

He has been left so weak he can barely stand and was suffering from hypothermia, dehydration and pneumonia when he was rescued by the RSPCA along with police and veterinary staff.

He was rescued by the RSPCA on Tuesday and underwent an operation at Catley Cross Veterinary Clinic, where he is continuing to fight for his life

Sarah Elmy, from the charity, said: 'Poor Gizmo was just abandoned without his mum and left to die by the side of the road.

'He was so weak he was just collapsed and couldn't - and still can't - stand, and you can see every bone in his body, he's so thin.

'We had to carry him to the van on a rug. He was so keen to live, though, bless him.

'Even though he was lying flat out, he was trying to reach forward and crawl himself along the ground to get to grass.

'As soon as we propped him up he was nibbling, trying to eat from our hand. It was so heartbreaking. I just really hope he pulls through - he's certainly trying his best.'

An Essex Police spokesperson said: 'We assisted the RSPCA in recovering a sick horse in Yeldham Road in Ridgewell on February 17.' 

Gizmo underwent surgery at Catley Cross Veterinary Clinic and following a post on its Facebook page, people have stepped in to raise £11,000 to cover his care. 

Veterinary surgeon, Carolyn Wise, from the centre, said: 'It is touch and go at the moment. Gizmo is walking a fine line.

'But he is eating and trying to live so we have everything crossed he will pull through - he is such a lovely foal. He has melted all our hearts.

'It seems we are not the only ones as we have been overwhelmed by people phoning us wanting to help, after we put up a short appeal on our Facebook page.

'We are so grateful for such a heartwarming response. It just shows you how much people care.'

More than £3,000 has already donated by 220 well-wishers in less than 24 hours, which already covers more than half his medical costs.

The RSPCA, which has more than 600 horses in its care nationally, says any surplus funds will be used for the rescue and treatment of other horses in a similar situation.
