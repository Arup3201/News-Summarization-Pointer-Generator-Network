Ekangamene uploaded a snap of his old number 43 Manchester United shirt onto Instagram and thanked his former club for the four years he spent at Old Trafford following his move from Royal Antwerp.

He said: 'Thanks for the 4years Manchester United! Nobody will probably understand why I left Man United, but was the best thing for me, family and the people who are close to me.

'Wish them all the best and hope Man United get back where they belong!'

Ekangamene, who is capable of playing at centre-back as well as in midfield, was loaned out to Carlisle United in January after failing to break into Manchester United's first team.
