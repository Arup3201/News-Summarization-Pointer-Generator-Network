Two 
elderly women roommates stand accused of scamming an older woman 
suffering from dementia out of $450,000 she had set aside for her 
beloved cat.

Randi
 Berkowitz, 63, and Patricia DiGiacomo, 58, of Brighton, Massachusetts, 
liquidated in the past year the 74-year-old woman’s $216,000 retirement 
account, ‘bought’ her condo for $1 and opened numerous credit cards in 
her name, authorities said.

The
 pair then went on a shopping spree that included a new car, 
electronics, a $500 blender and a Netflix subscription, court documents 
showed. They were arraigned Thursday on a 63-count indictment, according
 to the Boston Globe.

Charged: Patricia DiGiacomo and Randi Berkowitz are accused of looting $450,000 from an elderly neighbor

‘This is one of the most startling cases of elder exploitation we’ve seen in years,’ District Attorney Daniel Conley to WCVB.

"We
 believe the defendants exploited a position of trust to drain the 
victim’s bank account, take ownership of her home, and even buy 
themselves a new car with her savings.

The
 unnamed woman was friended by Berkowitz and DiGiacomo prior her giving 
the them control over her assets in late 2012 under the ruse they would 
care for her seven-year-old cat, an investigation revealed.

DiGiacomo used a number of shifting aliases to gain her trust, including the name of a close frined of the victim, officials said.

‘They
 befriended this victim and the victim made the fateful mistake of 
naming Miss Berkowitz as her power of attorney,’ District Attorney 
Michele Granda said during their arraignment.

On the move: The women are accused of buying a MINI Cooper similar to the 2010 model shown here with their victim's cash

‘Once
 Miss Berkowitz became the elderly woman’s power of attorney, she and 
Miss DiGiacomo siphoned off the victim’s cash, credit, and condo for 
themselves.’

The
 proceeds from their scam allowed the women to buy a $27,000 2010 Mini 
Cooper with a check written from the victim’s personal account, as well 
as an iPad, a Vitamix blender and other items, said officials.

Their
 victim had about $216,000 in her retirement account before allowing the
 duo access to control finances but was left with only $2.16 by the time
 a conservator stopped the fraud, according to Granda.

The money was set aside by the disabled woman to take care of her beloved ‘Puddy Cat.’

Credit
 cards were also opened in the victim's name to satiate their greed  as 
they even convinced her to ‘sell’ her $275,000 condo to them for just 
$1.

Both of the accused thieves did all this while collecting social security benefits for chronic health issued, authorities said.

Berkowitz’s
 lawyer called the case a ‘witch hunt’, said ‘it’s vindictive’ and that 
‘the community has been poisoned against them’ during the hearing.

DiGiacomo’s attorney claimed the defendants ‘have a very close and loving relationship.’

The accused thieves also face a number of other unrelated fraud charges after being 
accused of scamming doctors out of hardcore prescription pain killers.

‘Over the period of 21 months, it essentially reduced to about 34 pills a day,’ Granda said, according to WBZ.

The only words uttered by either of the accused in court were ‘not guilty.’

They
 were allowed to remain free but have been barred from going anywhere 
near the nursing home where the woman resides or the animal hospital 
where the cat is currently being treated.
