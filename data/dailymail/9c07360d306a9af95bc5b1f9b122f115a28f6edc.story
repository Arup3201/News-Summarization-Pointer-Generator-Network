 The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s beloved pet dog, Lupo, is set to be immortalised in a series of children’s books and toys.

Featuring a picture of the pampered cocker spaniel on the cover, The Adventures of Lupo the Royal Dog: The Secret of Windsor Castle, will hit bookshelves in September - with three further stories and a range of merchandise to follow.

Its author Abigail King took her inspiration from the frequent walks she enjoys with her own spaniel, Lily, in Kensington Gardens, where Lupo is also exercised.

Author Aby King has written a series of books 'inspired' by the Duchess of Cambridge's own pet dog 'Lupo'

The royal pedigree came from a litter born to Kate’s family dog, Ella, in 2011 and was brought back to Kensington Palace at Christmas that year.

Ironically given the new book deal, William and Kate’s spokesman at first refused to even confirm their new pet’s existence, saying it was a ‘private matter’ - even though the Queen and other dog-loving members of the royal family happily release details of their animals on the royal website.

‘We don’t want to breach our own privacy,’ an aide said.

There was then another month-long stand-off after royal aides also declined to reveal the puppy’s name.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have created a number of companies to protect their 'brand' from people trying to cash-in on their fame

It eventually emerged after a seven-year-old boy simply asked the Duchess when she visited a primary school in Oxfordshire.

After being handed a toy dog by young Abubakr Hussain, Kate said she would name it after her own pet, Lupo, which means Lupo in Italian and is a derivative of the Latin word for the animal.

The pup now has its paws firmly under the table with Kate even telling one well-wisher who gave her a gift for the dog on the family’s three-week tour of Australia and New Zealand last month that she was missing Lupo terribly.

‘Everyone gives presents for George but nobody knows how much I’m missing my own dog,’ she said.

‘This is the first present I’ve received for my dog and I’m really happy because I do miss him. He’ll be really happy to have this to play with.’

The stuffed toy was then flown back to the UK - First Class - with other official gifts.

Although somewhat overshadow by the birth of Prince George, the Lupo books will bring the royal pooch back under the spotlight.

The series has been acquired in the UK by international giant Hodder Children’s Books, who also publish Enid Blyton, and describe it as a ‘One Hundred and One Dalmatians for today’s readers’. It is hoped that a deal may be struck for the US rights to the book.

In the first story Lupo is accused of a serious crime he did not commit - an attack on a swan, which are protected under the Queen’s charter.

In his efforts to prove his innocence, he crosses paths with the dastardly corgi Vulcan - named after one of the Queen’s actual pets, a corgi-dachshund cross known as a Dorgi - who has discovered a centuries old secret which he is determined to ‘use against England and the crown’.

Members of the Royal Family including William, Kate, George and the Queen, all make appearances in the book, but the focus is very much on the animals of the Royal Household and their adventures.

Miss King has now trademarked Lupo with an eye to cashing in on the valuable merchandising market, putting his name on everything from action figures to bath toys, board games, cuddly toys and even scooters.

The move to capture that market is particular interesting given the Mail’s revelation earlier this year that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had secretly set up firms to protect their own ‘brand’ and ‘intellectual property rights’.

It enables the couple to sell officially-endorsed products and take action against anyone selling items that could harm their ‘image’.

A Kensington Palace spokesman declined to comment on the book deal yesterday.

Privately educated Miss King, 38, says she has never meet Kate or Lupo personally, although she frequently writes about walking with the royal pet or how his favourite food is toast on social media accounts such as Facebook.

She insists the books were simply inspired by walking her own dog, Lilly, whom she describes as Lupo’s ‘girlfriend’, in Kensington gardens in the spring of 2012.

She said: ‘I’d seen in the papers that Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge now had their very own Lilly - a black cocker spaniel named Lupo - and I started to think about what life as a royal puppy, with palaces and parks at your disposal, might be like.’

The royal family inhabits a ‘secret’, behind-closed-doors world we never really get to see. Could a series of books about a dog like Lupo help children explore it?

‘Over the next few months, the idea never strayed far from my mind. I began to see the scope for mystery and adventure - secret passageways and tunnels in royal palaces, portals to other times. A royal menagerie of characters began to form in my head. ‘

First time author Miss King has a tragic family history. Her mother was a successful model and actress in the 1960s, who died of leukaemia when she was just 14.

And in 2008 her property developer fiancée shot himself just five weeks before their wedding amid the collapse of his business empire.

Miss King, who recently re-married, says her dog, Lily, was instrumental in bringing joy back into her life.

Her agent Vicki Field added: ‘It is a really exciting and imaginative children’s book that draws its reader into the imaginary world of Lupo, the royal dog.

‘Abigail has included fleeting references to the Duke, Duchess and Prince George as well as other members of the royal family, but the focus is very much on the animals of the Royal Household - dogs, corgis, cats, mice and the like. We are very excited about the project.’
