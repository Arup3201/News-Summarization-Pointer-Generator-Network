One of the University of Alberta's oldest underclassmen is a 60-year-old man who's come back to school to study the cancer that ended his wife's life.

Powel Crosley's wife Sladjana died in 2009 at the age of 58 due to granulosa, a rare form of ovarian cancer.

Only 5 per cent of ovarian cancer cases are diagnosed as granulosa.

CBS News reports Crosely spent his career to now in information technology, and enrolled in cllege again in 2010.

Powel Crosley, seen here with wife Sladjana, who died of a rare type of ovarian cancer in 2009, has returned to school at the age of 60 to study the disease that took her from him

'The main thing I'm trying to do is come up with an effective treatment,' he said.

Crosley especially hopes to find better drugs for patients than many now which are 'highly toxic'

He's now doing course work in biochemistry and oncology and has secured a $60,000 grant to continue researching.

A promising drug developed by the University of Illinois is among the compounds he's currently testing.

The drug, Pac-1, has shown some results with lymphoma, which carries a mortality rate of 85 per cent.

He's also hoping to find something easier for patients to process.

'Many of the drugs are highly toxic,' he told reporters.

In Sladjana's case, the fatal problem came from internal bleeding cause by a medication.

She was initially diagnosed in 1996.

Despite undergoing six major surgeries and multiple clinical trials, the cancer metastasized to her liver and lungs.

'They
 told us they caught it early, they told us there was no sign of  the 
disease, they told us it wouldn't come back,'he told CBS News.

Much as her husband is doing now, she studied scientific literature about her cancer for 13 years and was the one who found literature pointing to Pac-1.

Crosley has helped get a $60,000 grant to continue his research at the University of Alberta

She also founded the Granulosa Cell Tumor Research Foundation to help patients get information about their disease.

Her husband has since taken over running the foundation.

'She 
had tremendous drive and determination to look into things and achieve 
things.' Crosely said. 'She was incredibly intelligent and just a very strong person.

'Her motto was: The answer lies in the lab. She was pretty persistent about things she 
believed in. And so I'm just basically completing her mission.'
