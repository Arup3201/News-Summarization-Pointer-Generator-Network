Two police officers have been left red-raced after apparently being filmed enjoying an iced coffee on an outdoor table while their marked police car is parked in a No Standing zone.

The two officers from Victoria Police were filmed by a disgruntled member of the public, who then decided to embarrass the officers by posting the clip on Facebook on a page called 'Victoria Police Corruption'.

The video, which was taken on Hawthorn Road Caulfield North, in Melbourne's inner south-east, has already garnered over 230,000 views since it was uploaded 21 hours ago.

Two Victoria Police have been filmed  enjoying an iced coffee while their police car is parked in a No Standing zone

The home video  shows the two officers sitting at an outdoor table sipping drinks at a café, having parked their car within walking distance to their table, in a No Standing zone.

Clearly upset with the officers' misconduct, the Facebook member uses his phone to film the unlawful act, hoping to name and shame the officers involved in the incident.

'Nice place for lunch,' the man filming the video says, taunting the officers with his camera.

'Parked in a No Standing, you’d give us a ticket for that wouldn't you.' he says, repeating it when he gets no response from the officers. 

The police officers give the man the cold shoulder, not acting up for the camera.   

'Wouldn't you constable' the man says, referring to the parking ticket,  as he zooms in on the officers name tag.

'Did you get my name?,' the constable asks, as the man decides to turn off his recording device as the policeman answers him back.

As the Daily Mail understands, police vehicles may park in No Standing zones in emergency situations.

Police officers also need to be in close proximity to their car, should an emergency arise. 

The man used his video phone to name and shame the police officers, zooming in on their name tags and asking them probing questions about their misconduct

The Facebook group 'Victoria Police Corruption' states that they are: 'An open platform for documenting police news, misconduct, brutality and abuse of power' 

'The practice of Police investigating Police needs to end' the page says.

Over 1,200 people commented on the post, with the majority of commenters siding with Victoria Police in this situation. 

Users of the Facebook page 'Victoria Police Corruption' had their say on the video

One commenter said: 'emergency vehicles can park where ever they want. they won't be fined. and they shouldn't. get a life and learn the rules before you slander people whos career is to to help ungrateful people like the original filmer when its their turn to cry for help. dont bite the hand that feeds you!'

Many commenters sided with the police in this situation

Another member also sided with the police, telling the video-man that they should be left to have their breakfast in peace.

'This police officer should be commended for having such patience with a complete flog when he's just trying to eat his lunch. The exemption is not a privilege, they need to be near their car in case they're called for an emergency. I'm happy I don't have to worry about my job when I'm on my lunch break, have some respect for those that put their life on the line to keep you safe,' she said. 

One commenter said she was happy she didn't have to be on-call during her lunch brake and said the video-man should be ashamed of himself

However one Facebook user believed the police officers should be setting a good example to other road users.

'Yes you are all right. It's an emergency vehicle and they need to be close at all times. It's understandable he needs his car 5 feet away while he eats so how about put there desks on the footpath too. Wake up, they are taking advantage of their positions because they think they are higher in the food chain. How can you respect someone who can't set an example to be respected.' he said.

However. not all Facebook users were as understanding, with one commenter suggesting the police should set a good example to other road users

Victoria Police told Daily Mail Australia, that all employees are 'required to park police vehicles legally at all times, unless exempt from doing so.'  

'An exemption is available under the Road Rules Victoria Regulation Act 2009 for drivers of emergency vehicles. Information on exemptions is available in part 19 of the act,' they said.
