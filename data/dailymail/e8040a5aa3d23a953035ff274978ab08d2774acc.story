An anti-Semitic job advert looking for a computer graphics designer who is 'not Jewish if possible' has sparked outrage after appearing on a French website.

The advert appeared on specialist jobs site www.graphic-jobs.com for 35 minutes on Monday, apparently posted by Parisian design agency NSL Studio. 

But NSL Studio has since moved to distance itself from the advert - which was quickly taken down from the site - claiming it had been hacked on the company's Twitter account.

In a statement on its website, NSL Studio revealed it had filed a complaint with Paris' prosecutor, saying it 'strongly condemned' the anti-Semitic sentiment in the advert, which also asked for applicants to be motivated, well-organised and with three to four years experience.

'NSL Studio is an agency of integrity that does not discriminate,' it said, adding: 'The person in charge of the ad will be questioned, a probe launched and the necessary measures taken if it turns out that it really came from us.' 

The specialised jobs website, meanwhile, has apologised, saying its moderators had failed to notice the ad for around 35 minutes before it was deleted. 

The advert - which came less than a month after the attacks at a Jewish deli which left four people dead, two days after the massacre at the Charlie Hebdo offices - was roundly criticised on Twitter. 

SOS Racisme spokeswoman Aline Kremer said: 'This is a proven case of public discrimination based on the real or supposed belonging to a race, ethnic group or religion, which is punishable by law.'

The Jewish community has been targeted in several attacks since four people were killed at a Jewish deli in January - including today, when three French soldiers were attacked and wounded in a knife attack in Nice outside a Jewish community centre

The advert's appearance will no doubt pour fuel on existing tensions in France.

Jewish communities called for extra protection the in the wake of January's attacks, which left a total of 17 people dead, including the four in the Jewish deli.

Then today, three soldiers guarding a Jewish community centre in Nice were stabbed by a 'suspected jihadist'.

Some Jewish leaders have been advising Jews living in Europe to consider relocating to Israel, in the belief the continent is no longer safe for their community.

The deli was targeted on purpose - and has led to fears anti-Semtitism is on the rise in Europe.

Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, seen here speaking at the funerals, has said Israel would welcome Jews from Europe to Israel

Speaking at Paris' Great Synagogue two days after the attack, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: 'But Jews of our time have been blessed with another right, a right that did not exist for previous generations of Jews: the right to join their Jewish brothers and sisters in our historic homeland... 

'Any Jew who wishes to immigrate to Israel will be welcomed with open arms and warm and accepting hearts.' 

Meanwhile, French counter-terrorism experts have identified 64 suburbs in dozens of cities that act as breeding grounds for Islamic extremism.

The French government also believes that around 400 French citizens have travelled to Syria and Iraq to fight alongside militants from the Islamic State terror group.
