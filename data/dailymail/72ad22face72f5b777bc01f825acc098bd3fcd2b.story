A former fishery owner is demanding £2.5million damages from the Environment Agency claiming that otters it introduced to a nearby river ate all his 22,000 carp.

Brian Dodson said the agency set up an otter haven without informing him of the impact they would have on the stock in his six lakes.

Mr Dodson, 60, established the Waen Wen Fishery near Bangor, North Wales, digging out the lakes and filling them with £250,000 worth of fish. But then the agency set up the otter haven a couple of miles away on the River Cegin.

Mr Dodson said his business never quite got off the ground and he decided to sell some of his stock in 2008 – but found that he had none.

‘When I netted one lake that I thought had 8,500 carp in nothing came out,’ he said. ‘This has ruined me financially.’

He said he has been unable to sell the fishery and it has now been taken off him by his mortgage company. 

He claims that over a period of years his valuable fish were decimated by the carnivorous creatures, ruining his business before it had got off the ground, the 60-year-old claims.

Mr Dodson said that had the Environment Agency told him of the probability of otters re-colonising the nearby river he could have taken protective steps, like putting up a protective fencing.

He is suing the agency for breaching the Environment Act 1995, claiming it had a duty of care to consult landowners when planning the otter initiative.

Mr Dodson is seeking £2.5 million to cover the loss of income he believes he would have recouped from anglers using his fishery.

The matter will go before the High Court next month in what could become a landmark case for fishery owners across the country who have had similar issues with otters.

Buzzards were almost extinct 30 years ago but there are now nearly 40,000 in Britain.

But it caused red faces at Defra, which wanted tighter controls on the species to protect pheasants but had to scrap the plans last year after a public outcry.

In Australia, cane toads were successfully introduced in the 1930s. But they have been blamed for a sharp dip in other predatory reptiles ever since.

They have also been accused of putting quolls in danger, with the native marsupial partial to the toad's toxic skin.

Britons are still shocked when they see a wallaby hoping around. The animal - a common sight in Australia - was brought into the wild in the UK in 1930s and sightings continue today.

A more recent success in the UK is the beaver, which was reintroduced from Europe more centuries after disappearing.

Since then they have returned to nearly every corner of Britain.

But critics say the scheme has been ill thought as there is not enough food in our waterways to sustain their booming numbers.

As a result otters - which have no natural predator - are said to have been picking off big and cumbersome fish from fisheries and putting them in jeopardy.

Mr Dodson's Waen Wen Fishery, near Bangor, in North Wales, has lain empty and out of use for several years now.

He said: 'This has ruined me financially and left me devastated. I built a fishery from scratch, there was nothing there at all before.

'I got all of the planning permission and it took me a few years to dig out the six lakes and filled them up with carp.

'In all that time didn't know the Environment Agency were promoting a nature reserve on the nearby River Cegin.

Nobody said a word to me about the otters.

'We then started hearing all these stories about otters being spotted no more than two miles away from us.

'In 2008 I set about trying to sell off some carp to and when I netted a lake that had 8,500 carp in nothing came out.

'I brought a consultant in and we drained the lake and it was empty. I later found evidence of fish bones that had been stripped of its flesh.

'My case is that under the Environment Act 1995, the Environment Agency had a duty to carry out some sort of notice or consultation with me before the work began to encourage otters into the area.

Price of success: Otters are flourishing across Britain thanks to a programme of reintroducing them to the wild

'This case could open the way for 
other fishery owners in Britain who feel they have not been given 
sufficient warning about the rising otter population.'

Mr
Dodson spent 22 years working as a process control engineer at oil and 
gas refineries in the Middle East and saved up to start up his fishery 
business.

Curig Jones, a spokesman for Environment Agency Wales, said: 'We are preparing to challenge this claim robustly on all counts.'

The four-day hearing is set to take place at the High Court in Cardiff on February 25.
