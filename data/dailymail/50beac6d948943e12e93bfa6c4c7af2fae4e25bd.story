Anti-sleaze campaigners claimed a victory for parents  yesterday as watchdogs finally rebuked ITV for showing nudity before the watershed on one of its flagship reality shows.

In a landmark judgment, media regulator Ofcom found the broadcaster broke official rules by showing a  burlesque dancer’s naked bottom before the 9pm cut-off.

It said ITV had crossed a ‘clear line’ by showing dancer Scarlet Cuffs stripping to just a feather boa and a necklace during an episode of Britain’s Got More Talent.

Burlesque dancer Scarlet Cuffs peformed a striptease on Britain's Got Talent - to Ofcom's displeasure

The performer began her raunchy routine by turning her back to the audience and unzipping her gold dress

The episode was repeated three times 
before the watershed – including at 1.30pm – and was seen by almost 
350,000 children under 15.

It is the first time Ofcom has found 
that Britain’s Got Talent or The X Factor has breached its code on what 
can be aired before the watershed.

The decision follows years of 
criticism of its ‘toothless’ regulation of sexualised content and was 
welcomed as a clear warning to ITV to tone down the content of its 
flagship entertainment shows.

Last year, Ofcom decided a similar 
burlesque routine by BGT dancer Beatrix Von Bourbon was on the ‘margins 
of acceptability’, while a series of raunchy performances on the  X 
Factor have failed to draw clear condemnation.

As the routine progressed, presenter Stephen Mulhern was seen egging her on from the side of the stage

Covered by MailOnline, this is the shot that angered regulator Ofcom, who said it was unsuitable for children

Now campaigners have urged the 
watchdog to fine broadcasters who allow offensive language, violence and
sex before the watershed. Vivienne Pattison of lobby group Mediawatch, 
said she was delighted by the ruling, adding: ‘Ofcom put out guidance on
this well over a year ago, but broadcasters simply ignored it. 
Hopefully this decision will finally make them change their ways.

‘It is a victory for parents who are 
concerned about what their children are being exposed to before the 
watershed. Finally we have a clear signal that it has got to stop.

‘I want Ofcom to show its teeth by 
hitting broadcasters where it hurts. I want to see it backing up its 
words with real sanctions.’ Currently Ofcom does not have the power to 
impose fines. Nevertheless yesterday’s ruling will be seen by ITV as a 
serious rebuke.

Scarlet Cuffs – whose real name is 
Charlie Knight – first appeared on Britain’s Got More Talent on April 
13. The ITV2 spin-off programme shows footage and auditions not aired in
the main BGT competition.

Aired at 8.35pm, the episode showed 
Miss Knight, 31, appear on stage in a sequinned dress before singing 
Disney hit The Bare Necessities to judges Simon Cowell, David Walliams, 
Alesha Dixon and Amanda Holden.

She slowly unzipped her dress before 
stripping completely, using only a feather boa to cover what remained of
her modesty before turning and wiggling her naked bottom to the 
audience. In its judgment yesterday, Ofcom said that, although a series 
of one and two-second shots of Miss Knight’s bottom were pixelated, the 
measure was ‘of limited effectiveness’ and ‘did not sufficiently obscure
the performer’s naked buttocks’.

Judges David Walliams, Alesha Dixon, Amanda Holden and Simon Cowell were startled by the striptease

It added: ‘The frequency and detail of
these images in context of a striptease in a burlesque act meant that 
on balance they were not suitable for children.’

The episode was repeated three times, 
at 5.30pm the following day and at 6.30am and 1.30pm on April 17. Ofcom 
said the scenes were seen by a ‘significant child audience’ and 
concluded the episode breached rule 1.3 of its code, which states: 
‘Children must…be protected by appropriate scheduling from material that
is unsuitable.’

Earlier this year, Ofcom decided not 
to investigate Britain’s Got Talent after a risqué performance by 
Jennifer Lopez drew complaints.

In April last year, it did investigate
a routine by BGT dancer Beatrix Von Bourbon, which was aired at 8pm. 
But, despite the fact she partially revealed her buttocks, it decided 
the act did not break any rules.

And in 2011, Ofcom was criticised for 
clearing ITV’s other flagship reality show The X Factor over  lewd 
performances by both Rihanna and Christine Aguilera.

Tony Close of Ofcom said: ‘There is a 
clear line in terms of what it is acceptable to broadcast before the 9pm
watershed. A striptease act broadcast at times when a significant 
number of children were likely to be watching crossed this line.’

An ITV spokesman said: ‘We note Ofcom’s decision.’
