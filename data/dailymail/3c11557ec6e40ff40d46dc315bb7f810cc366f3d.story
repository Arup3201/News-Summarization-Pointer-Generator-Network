He’s had a tricky few months since confirming he fathered an out-of-wedlock son, but Arnie is making a comeback.

The former California governor made his first speech in the state following the disastrous revelations as he edges back into the public eye.

Arnold Schwarzenegger, 64, has appeared in public only sporadically in recent months, despite once being among the most public of men.

In the days after he split with wife Maria Shriver, he told agents to postpone his movie projects and his once-lively Twitter account went dead.

He hired a divorce lawyer, and the former Hollywood star known to crave the spotlight went into a self-imposed exile to sort out his family problems.

But he started tweeting again in late June when travelling to his native Austria for an environmental conference, far from his troubles in the U.S.

Then last month, he announced he will return to acting with a starring role in the Lionsgate film ‘Last Stand’.

Mr Schwarzenegger will play a border-town sheriff who unwittingly finds himself battling a notorious drug kingpin on the run.

He is known for his appearances in films such as The Terminator, Predator and True Lies - and his famous catchphrase: 'I'll be back'.

‘We have too many of the legislators 
that are too far to the right or too far to the left, and therefore 
nothing gets done'

Mr Schwarzenegger never mentioned his marital problems in the appearance, or his admission of fathering his now-teenage son with maid Mildred Baena.

A crowd applauded him after he recounted teaming with business leaders to reform the state's workers' compensation laws.

He gave a glossy recounting of his uneven years in Sacramento, cherry-picking accomplishments such as re-districting reform.

But, sporting a deep tan, Mr Schwarzenegger never mentioned the state economy has struggled for years, during his talk to a business group.

The moderate Republican joked that he was running for president in 2012 - of a body-building association.

But he warned about the dangers of political gridlock, saying that partisan division was choking progress in California and Washington.

‘We have too many of the legislators that are too far to the right or too far to the left, and therefore nothing gets done,’ he said.

The speech comes in the midst of his divorce, which is unfolding largely behind closed doors.

Last month he withdrew a request for a judge to terminate Ms Shriver's right to spousal support, and he clarified he is willing to pay her lawyer.

Once a popular governor, Mr Schwarzenegger returned to the public stage with his image badly bruised.

One poll taken after disclosures about the son and his split found nine of 10 voters in his home county of Los Angeles didn't like him.
