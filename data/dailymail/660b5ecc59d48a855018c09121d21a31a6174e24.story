A judge is issuing an arrest warrant for a 77-year-old Utah man who police say was sunbathing nude in his backyard next to a Mormon church parking lot.

Court records show the $5,000 cash-only warrant was issued Tuesday after Myron Lee Kipp failed to show up at a court hearing in his lewdness case.

Kipp has pleaded not guilty to seven misdemeanor counts of lewdness, four involving a child.

According to a probable cause statement, police were called to Kipp's home on March 5 after witnesses saw him sunbathing naked in his backyard. According to public records, Kipp owns a home on East 200 N Road, next to the Farmington Chapel Mormon church

Not suitable for church: An arrest warrant has been issued to a Utah man who was charged with lewdness for sunbathing nude in his backyard, in view of adults and children standing in an adjacent church parking lot

Those witnesses included three adults and four children standing in the adjacent parking lot of the chapel.

Kipp was allegedly visible since he had a chain link fence with no privacy slats.

When police confronted Kipp, he told an officer 'he was sun bathing and that it was his property and he could do it if he wanted,' the record states.

That's when police forced Kipp to dress, arrested him and took him to jail.

Defense attorney William Albright didn't immediately return a message seeking comment.
