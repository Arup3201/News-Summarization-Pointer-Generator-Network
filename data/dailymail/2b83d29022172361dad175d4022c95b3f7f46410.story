A family pet dog was shot dead in his owner’s back yard by a policeman searching for a missing three-year-old boy.

Sean Kendall, 27, met with Salt Lake City police officials this week to discuss the fatal shooting of his two-year-old Weimaraner, Geist.

Police were searching for a three-year-old boy named Kelby who had been reported missing - he was eventually found asleep in his own basement.

Police said the officer who was searching in Kendall's yard felt the dog was aggressive and going to attack him, and that's why he shot the animal.

Now Kendal is calling for the officer to be fired from the force, saying he is 'extremely frustrated and upset' at the apparent reluctance of the police to take action against the officer who shot his dog.

'The only thing that I would be satisfied with is having this officer terminated,' said Kendall, reported The Salt Lake Tribune.

'I feel that his judgment was completely inappropriate.'

Kendall told KSL said Geist had never been aggressive or lunged at anybody, so 'the idea that he attacked an officer — it just doesn't make sense,' he said.

'I believe my dog came out of the dog kennel to see what was going on, who was here, stopped right here, and those were his last moments.'

Kendall said Geist had a single gunshot wound to the head.

'Just the sheer sight of seeing my dog there — it was traumatizing,' Kendall said.

Another case: A Baltimore police officer was suspended in a case in which he and another cop allegedly slit a dog's throat. Owner Sarah Gossard said her dog Nala, pictured, went missing and she had been trying to track the Shar-Pei down

'Now he's dead. I have him wrapped up in a blanket in the back of my truck, and now I have to go bury him.'

Kendall’s attorney, Brett Boulton, said he believes his client should be compensated.

But Sgt. Greg Wilking said the officer did not break the law when he entered Kendall’s backyard.

'There are extenuating circumstances,' said Wilking reported The Salt Lake Tribune.

'A child is missing, and if you’re a parent, you would want us to look everywhere for your child. We wouldn’t want to leave any stone unturned.'

Earlier this week a second Baltimore police officer was suspended in a shocking case in which he and another cop allegedly slit a dog's throat.

The Baltimore Sun reports officer Thomas Schmidt has been placed on a paid administrative leave along with fellow officer Jeffrey Bolger who has been charged with animal cruelty.

The pair allegedly held down and cut the throat of a Shar-Pei, with officials saying there was no reason to kill the dog if it was already restrained.

Schmidt is a 24-year veteran of the Special Operations Section, serving alongside Bolger who was hired in 1992.

The union did not provide information regarding the terms of Schmidt's suspension.

The alleged attack happened on Saturday morning in Brewers Hill, a south-eastern district of the city, after police responded to a report of a woman being bitten.

Deputy Commissioner Dean Palmere said officers gained control of the animal, a seven-year-old Chinese Shar-Pei, with a dog pole and an officer used a knife to cut the dog's throat.

Late last night, Detective Jeremy Silbert issued a statement identifying that policeman as Bolger.

Announcing that internal affairs were investigating the killing, Mr Palmere called the incident 'outrageous and unacceptable'.

Witnesses told police that as Bolger got out of his vehicle, he said: 'I'm going to f****** gut this thing.'

He waited until colleagues got control of the dog before bending down and slashing its throat with a knife, witnesses said. It bled to death before animal control arrived, police told the Baltimore Sun.
