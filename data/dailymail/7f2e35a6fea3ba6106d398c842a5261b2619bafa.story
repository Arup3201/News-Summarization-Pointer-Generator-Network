A spectacular country estate designed by Capability Brown, Britain's 'greatest gardener', has come on the market for £5.75million.

But if the new owner wants a stately home to match the grandeur of the huge parkland, they will have to build it themselves, as the last one was demolished after the grounds fell into disrepair.

Historic Redgrave Park, near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, dates back to the Doomsday Book and a magnificent mansion was built there in 1545.

The Redgrave Park estate, near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, has gone up for sale for nearly £6million but has no stately home due to the mansion being demolished after the Second World War

Redgrave Hall was built in the 16th century before its owners brought in famous gardener Capability Brown to design the grounds in the late 18th century

But Redgrave Hall fell into a state of neglect and after the Second World War, when Britain was virtually bankrupt, it was demolished due to a lack of money to repair it.

The footings and foundations remain today and planning experts believe obtaining permission to build a new hall in its place would be a formality. It could cost an extra three million pounds to build but the value of the whole estate would then be worth more than 10 million pounds.

The parkland was landscaped by Capability Brown in the 1760s. He remodelled the estate, most notably turning a small stream into a 44 acre lake and planting clumps of oak trees.

Redgrave is one of about 170 parklands design by Brown in Britain. It has been owned by Guy and Jill Topham for the last 40 years. The couple converted a large stable block on the grounds into a six-bedroom cottage where they live today.

The estate includes a six-bedroom cottage which was built by converting the park's stables, but sellers say getting permission to build a larger mansion should be easy

The estate, pictured in 1907, comes with 100,000sq ft of agricultural buildings, 142 acres of arable farmland  and 77 acres of woodland

Brown, real name Lancelot, got his nickname from his habit of telling prospective clients that their grounds had 'great capabilities'.

Before his time, gardens were formal exercises in geometry; walled in, topiaried, criss-crossed by straight paths, everything intended to show man’s control of nature.

Brown abolished walls and introduced curved paths and flowerbeds.

The word at the time was 'landscape', the idea that country houses were part of the landscape and you should see no boundary between the grounds and the surrounding countryside.

Nearing 
retirement, the Tophams are selling the estate that comes with the 
cottage, boat house and a Grade II listed folly that can easily be lived
 in.

It
 has 100,000sq ft of agricultural buildings which are currently hired 
out for storage, 142 acres of arable farmland, 173 acres of grassland 
and 77 acres of woodland.

Despite
 the huge size of the estate - the equivalent of 814 football pitches - 
the agents selling it claim it is 'perfectly manageable'.

William Hargreaves, of estate agents Savills, said: 'The vendors maintain the estate themselves using tractors and mowers. They aren't daunted by looking after 460 acres, it is perfectly manageable.

'From a farming point of view, it isn't very big. It is predominantly parkland and it isn't that labour intensive.'

Redgrave began life as a medieval deer park in 1211 when the Abbot of Bury St Edmunds had a hunting lodge there.

The imposing hall was built in the 16th century before the estate was bought by Sir John Holt, the then Lord Chief Justice, in the 1702.

It was his great-nephew who had the estate redesigned by Capability Brown 70 years later. It remained in the Holt family until 1971 when the Tophams bought it.

Mr Hargreaves said: 'The Tophams spent the majority of their time looking after it and making changes.

'There is quite an extensive range of agricultural buildings that form a business for storing agricultural produce.

'The resurrection of Redgrave Hall is perhaps the only project not undertaken by the current owners.

'The hall was requisitioned during the war and was used to billet 
British and American military personnel. The gardens became a 
wilderness.

'After the war the then owner decided to demolish the hall to raise money to plough into the estate. The contents were sold and the house itself was taken down brick by brick. The footings are still there.

'Our
 planning department has carried out an assessment of the site and 
concluded it may be possible, subject to planning consent, to reinstate 
the hall.

'The opportunity to buy a Capability Brown property just doesn't happen very often.'

It is estimated that it would cost an extra three million pounds to build a new mansion on the site but a new property would boost the value of the estate
