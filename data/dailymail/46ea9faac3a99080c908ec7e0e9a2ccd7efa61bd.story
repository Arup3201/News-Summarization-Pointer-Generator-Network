Last week she was unveiling her new clothing collection for Dorothy Perkins in Newcastle and today she's modelling her summer range, so is Amy Childs Essex's most successful export? It would appear so.

The beautician-turned-designer, who found fame on The Only Way Is Essex, became a millionaire thanks to her burgeoning brand - and there's just no stopping her.

Speaking to FEMAIL about her chic new range of springtime skater dresses, peplums, strappy tops, and feminine blouses, Amy, 23, said: 'I’ve really branched out for SS15.

'I wanted to give more options for all the girls out there who are going on holiday, going out, going to a lovely spring wedding - all of those things.'

She continued: 'I wanted to give the lovely ladies something to dress up in that updated their wardrobe but also flatters. I always sit down and think about what everyone wants in a collection, I look on twitter, ask my friends and my mum and look at trends. It’s a long process but I love it.'

Amy has certainly been shaking things up in the wardrobe department and says while she believes people sometimes see her as one dimensional, she says that behind closed doors she'd love to go wild with her style. 

'I’d love to be a style chameleon,' she said. 'I’m always looking in magazines at celebrity style and campaign shots. I style my friends sometimes and they style me; I love trying new things.'

Amy says that she wanted to give the 'lovely ladies' something to dress up in that updated their wardrobe but also flatters and admits she's been thinking long and hard about her new designs 

While her former TOWIE co-stars do support her fashion career, Amy has her sights set on Hollywood and would love to dress Khloe Kardashian and Dakota Johnson in her designs 

Despite her successes, Amy still believes that, like Victoria Beckham, it's difficult to be taken seriously as a designer after finding fame in another industry.

'I’ve tried hard to break out of that TOWIE box and I think I’ve done that,' she said. 'I was only on there for two seasons but people instantly pigeon hole you as "Essex", but that’s not what I’m about and my collection is for everyone; I don’t just design for TOWIE fans.'

'I’d love to dress Dakota Johnson,' she admitted. 'She’s so stunning. She has such striking features that she can really have fun with her fashion and still look elegant. Khloe Kardashian is another one - she has such amazing curves and is so stunning. I would love to have her in one of my dresses; she would look amazing.'

For now, Amy will be donning her own designs as she jets off on holiday with friends for some 'sun, sea and sangria'. 

'I’m really looking forward to relaxing somewhere sunny with friends – I spend most of the year being businesswoman Amy so it’ll be nice to kick back and just be fun Amy,' she said. 

'I go on holiday with my best friend usually; I would love to share it with someone special though, maybe in the future?,' she teased.

She does, however, admit that men 'definitely' struggle to approach her because of who she is.

She said: 'Some of my guy friends say they’ve heard that guys have not come and said "hi" to me as they were intimidated. I don’t get it though.'

So what kind of relationship is Amy looking for? 'One like the Beckhams',' she said. 

'They have their own businesses and things going on yet they still make time for each other to be a family. That’s the perfect relationship: still doing what you love and having that person to come home to.'
