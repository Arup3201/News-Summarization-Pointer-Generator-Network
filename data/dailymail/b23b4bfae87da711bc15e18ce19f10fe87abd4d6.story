Former Ryder Cup captain Ian Woosnam was not surprised ex-world number one Luke Donald was left out of Europe's team but admits occasionally decisions are made as much on gut feelings as form.

The latter was certainly an issue for Donald, who has registered only one top-10 finish since April, and he lost out in a four-way race with Ian Poulter, Lee Westwood and in-form rookie Stephen Gallacher for the three wildcard spots.

Poulter was an almost automatic pick after his inspirational performance at Medinah two years ago, Westwood is playing in his ninth Ryder Cup while Gallacher's recent displays virtually demanded inclusion.

Instinct: Ian Woosnam (pictured) believes McGinley will have made a 'gut decision' to omit Luke Donald

On that basis - despite having never lost in four events - it was an easier decision for captain Paul McGinley to leave out Donald.

Woosnam had a trickier task in 2006 when he led Europe to victory at the K Club - but not before his captaincy was branded pathetic by Thomas Bjorn after he missed out on a wildcard.

At a time when only two wildcards were available he opted for Darren Clarke and Westwood at the expense of the Dane, who qualified for this year's team on merit.

He admitted that decision came more down to instinct than anything else.

'It is a shame you have to leave out someone like Luke Donald but that is how it goes, I don't think he's holed enough putts all year to warrant a pick,' Woosnam said.

Criticism: Dane Thomas Bjorn branded Woosnam pathetic in 2006 for failing to name his as a wildcard

'In my time I had three people in my mind: it came down to either Thomas Bjorn, Westwood and Clarke and I'd already picked Clarke.

'It was a hard decision but what persuaded me was I felt Westwood would go better with Clarke, especially in the time of grieving Darren was going through (having lost wife Heather to cancer weeks earlier), and everything worked out.

'Lee partnered Darren in two matches and Darren won all his points that week.

'You have a gut feeling, you feel who is going to play well under pressure.

'I think with Thomas at the K Club he had a couple of issues with a hole there (the previous year he drove into water at the 17th three times to run up an 11 to lose the European Open) and that sometimes put bad memories in your head.'

Woosnam, an ambassador for bookmaker Betway, said team captaincy was all about man-management.

'When I picked the team on the first day I think I left out Henrik Stenson and Luke Donald and they were whingeing a little bit as to why they were left out,' he added.

'But I went up to them and told them they were playing in the (afternoon) foursomes and that cheered them up then.

'A captain has to get it into their heads quickly that they are all there to win the Ryder Cup.

'All they are is team members, nothing else. You are all as equal as each other, it doesn't matter who wins the points as long as we win as a team.'

Woosnam believes the absence from the USA team of 14-time major winner Tiger Woods due to injury will be viewed as a greater boost by the Americans than their counterparts.

'How many times has Woods been in a winning team?' he said.

'I think Europe are fearing more that Woods is not in the team because the USA might be without him.

'The Europeans will be looking at the American team and seeing how they are as unit and how they play together.'
