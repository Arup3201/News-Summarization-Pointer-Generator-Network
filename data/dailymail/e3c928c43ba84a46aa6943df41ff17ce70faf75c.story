A man convicted of the 1994 
execution-style shooting of a store clerk in Alabama was put to death last night - the 
third U.S. execution this week.

Derrick Mason, 37, was given a lethal injection and pronounced dead minutes later at 6:49pm at Alabama's Holman Prison.

Strapped to the gurney, Mason gave a brief statement, apologising to the victim's family 'for the hurt and pain I caused' them.

He thanked the victim's father for getting in touch years ago and granting him his forgiveness.

Just before the chemicals began coursing through the veins in Mason's arm, a prison chaplain held his hand and knelt and said a prayer before stepping back.

Mason's breathing slowed, his head tilted backward and his lips pursed several times before he became very still.

Minutes later, authorities closed the curtain on the death chamber.

During the execution, the condemned man's mother, Maggie Mason, sat in the front row with her head bowed down.

'He's resting for the first time,' she said repeatedly. Later she held the hands of some other family members present and said: 'He's gone.'

The family of victim Angela Cagle issued a statement afterwards saying it hopes the execution stands as a deterrent for those who consider committing heinous crimes.

'We sincerely wish he had made a different decision ... then neither of our families would have been here tonight,' her family said.

Mason was convicted of killing 25-year-old Miss Cagle in Huntsville on March 27, 1994, shooting her twice in the face at close range after ordering her to take her clothes off during an early morning robbery.

Miss Cagle was found dead in the back room of the convenience store where she worked.

An unidentified man later told police that Mason had committed the crime.

The informant described the gun used, told police that Mason was 'out of control' and 'trying to make a name for himself', and then led authorities to Mason's car.

Inside, police found a gun later determined to be the murder weapon.

After he was arrested, Mason confessed, court records show.

Mason's execution capped a busy week in U.S. death chambers.

On Wednesday Georgia put to death Troy Davis for the 1989 murder of a policeman, despite an international outcry and claims he was innocent.

In Texas, officials executed a white supremacist who dragged to death James Byrd Jr, a black man from East Texas.

Mason was also the fifth person executed in Alabama this year and the third to die since the state changed the first drug used in its execution cocktail from sodium thiopental to pentobarbital.

The change follows a nationwide shortage of sodium thiopental.

Over the years, Mason argued that his constitutional rights were violated because he was initially arrested on an unrelated misdemeanour assault warrant and therefore the gun found in his car should not have been admitted into evidence in the murder case.

He also argued that his confession was involuntary because he was subjected to improper questioning, intoxicated and hungry during the interrogation, psychologically coerced, and misled by law enforcement officers.

Mason alleged that police interrogators grabbed him, pinned him down to his chair, and forced him to look at photographs, court records show.

Mason had exhausted appeals by Thursday, including an 11th-hour bid before the U.S. Supreme Court.
