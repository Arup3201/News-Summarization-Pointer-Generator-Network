Once described as the 'grandest house in Scotland', Britain's most expensive repo home is being sold for a knockdown price of £1.6 million.

Melville House with its 11 main bedrooms, seven reception rooms and stunning architectural features has become one of the greatest bargains on the housing market.

The pile, set in 16 acres at Monimail, near Cupar, Fife, Scotland, is the former home of the politician who helped Prince William of Orange take the throne.

It was on the market for £4.5 million, but now just £1.6 million is being asked for it.

Melville House: It was once valued at £4.5m, but failed to find a buyer and became Britain's most expensive repossession in 2005

One of seven reception rooms at Melville House, Fife, Scotland which is on the market at a knockdown price of £1.6 million

It was built in 1697 using the wealth accrued by Protestant sympathiser George Meville, who became Secretary of State for Scotland through his loyalty to the king in the 17th century Glorious Revolution. He was later given an earldom.

It was built by the Surveyor of Royal Works James Smith, who also helped build the Palace of Holyroodhouse and Drumlanrigg Castle.

But the pile, endured a chequered history over the centuries. It was once valued at £4.5m but failed to find a buyer and became Britain's most expensive repossession in 2005.

The current owners bought the property in 2009 after it was repossessed by a South African bank from its previous residents.

Agents Knight Frank: 'The most enchanting tree house has been built to keep lookout over the front drive'

The wow factor: Melville House has five bathrooms

Now it's for sale again, complete with all the furniture and fittings, including the billiard table.

Estate agents Knight Frank describe it as: 'An imposing Grade A listed, Neo-Palladian mansion house set within beautiful Fife countryside.

'Further to the main house are two cottages and two pavilions providing additional accommodation.

Melville House is one of the most significant houses in Fife with 11 main bedrooms, a staff flat, two self-contained wings and charmingly converted Pavilions. The accommodation is entirely flexible.

'Commercial kitchens in the basement allow for outside catering.'

Adjacent courtyard stables and coach houses were once converted to provide classrooms with a central stage and games hall, but they are being upgraded to provide a cinema, gymnasium, showers and treatment rooms.

Bargain price: One of several grand reception rooms - the mansion is stylishly furnished

Downtime: a beautiful pool table and furnished room

The cricket lawn and tennis court are also being upgraded and, adds a Knight Frank spokesman: 'The most enchanting treehouse has been built to keep lookout over the front drive.'

The chequered history of the building started with the first owner: George Melville only lived in the house before he died and the estate was passed on to his family who owned it until 1949 when it was sold.

It was turned into a private school for children with special needs for almost 50 years, although the Army used it as a hospital and temporary barracks during World War II.
