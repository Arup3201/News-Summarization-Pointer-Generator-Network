Louis van Gaal wants to get shut of a plethora of Manchester United players this week in developments Ryan Giggs couldn't have predicted three years ago. 

The Reds' assistant manager is quoted as saying that Sir Alex Ferguson would never have allowed a similar demise to that of Liverpool to happen at Old Trafford. 

In an interview with the Daily Mirror in 2011 to have resurfaced this week, Giggs spoke strongly about the long-term vision of Ferguson, applauding his lavish spending on a raft of youngsters.

Forward planning! Giggs spoke of the foundations that Sir Alex Ferguson had laid at old Trafford 

That has, however, proven to be a fallacy with a number of Ferguson signings set to leave the club.

Javier Hernandez is attracting interest from Juventus and Valencia, while Anderson could exit should anyone stump up for his wages. 

'Our manager is not always looking just for this season,' said Giggs in 2011. 'He buys players with a view to the future, which he's done more and more over the last few years.

'He's bought players like Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney, Anderson and Nani - all young players who have got the ability to go on and be better, and all of whom have done that.

'Now we've got the next batch, the likes of Javier Hernandez, Rafael and Fabio Da Silva, Gabriel Obertan and Chris Smalling, all young players who will hopefully get better over the next few years.'

Two of the five above - Nani, Obertan and Fabio - have already sealed moves elsewhere in recent seasons, with the only player certain of a spot in Van Gaal's plans being Smalling.

Thanks for coming! Nani (now at Sporting Lisbon) is just one of Ferguson's signings to have departed the club
