A Virginia mother shot an intruder to protect her two-year-old daughter after he broke into her family home. Allie (pictured right with her two-year-old daughter, left), who has not given her full name, is the wife of a James City County officer and said the incident happened on Wednesday around 10.30pm, an hour after her husband left for work 

After the man, 25, broke through a window in her daughter's playroom, on instinct she grabbed her gun and fired two shots, injuring him (above her family home where the break in occurred)

The man, who has not been identified, is recovering in hospital with life-threatening injuries, and could face a burglary charge once out, according to WTKR.

Allie, who was trained by her husband on what to do during this type of incident, said the man started banging on her door and messing with the door knob while screaming things as he tried to get in.

She said: 'He was screaming like, 'Let me in baby, we are okay let me in, they are out to kill me,' I looked through the peephole and I didn't recognize who it was, so I latched the top lock, ran to the back, called 911 and got my gun.'

While she went to a back room to retrieve her gun, she heard a crash as the man broke into the playroom, an area where her child was only 30 minutes before the incident. She had only recently put her child to bed.

'She could have been in here playing and he could have busted in and fell on her or anything,' she said. 'All I knew is I wanted to stop him from hurting me or hurting my daughter.'

Allie said the man was behaving erratically, as if he was under the influence of drugs, and was coming at her, which is when she fired the gun twice.

The man was hit in his groin and a second bullet went through his hand and into his stomach. 

The mother said she kept the gun fixed on the intruder as she waited for responding officers to arrive, according to Fox and Friends.

Both Allie and her daughter were safe following the incident, but Allie said she is happy knowing it was not her or her daughter that was left in the hospital.

'It was either him or me,' said Allie. 'I have my daughter to protect.'
