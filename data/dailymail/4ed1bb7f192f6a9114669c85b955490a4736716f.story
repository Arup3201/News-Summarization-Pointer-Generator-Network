When the story of 'baby gammy' broke in August it sent shockwaves through the Thai surrogacy industry and shed new light on the growing use of imported surrogacy by many Australian couples.

Thai surrogacy was growing rapidly and the increase in Thai women having surrogate babies attracted the interest of a Bangkok TV station, where one journalist found out just how easy it was to have a surrogate baby.

A woman on the phone, nicknamed Goy, told the journalist she was a surrogate mother herself and that she had a down syndrome baby that had been abandoned by his Australian parents.

This information created a world media storm that came to Thailand to expose the 'baby gammy' story as well as exposing his Australian parents, the Farnells.

David Markovic was left with two babies in bangkok, Liam and Joe, because he was unable to get them back to Australia due to the crackdown on surrogacy in Thailand. The industry had a spotlight shined on it following the controversial 'Baby Gammy' case

But in doing so, the widely televised case, changed everything for Thai surrogacy and created a tyrade of problems for Australian couples who were desperate for a child.

'It's shed a light on this practice that many people were unaware of. Australia is a major source country for intending parents in surrogacy,' Dr. Anne Gallagher, an international human right lawyer told ABC's Four Corners.

'For better or worse international law and Australian law doesn't give us a right to be a parent, we need to start looking at the other parties involved in this, the child and look at the best interests of the child and the surrogate and perhaps we should be asking questions about justice and ethics and morality,' she said.

The exposure of Baby Gammy saw the crackdown of surrogate babies in Thailand and it lead the government to stop a number of Aussie couples who were trying to bring back a child. 

David Markovic was one of them.

After years of unsuccessful IVF, David and his wife Lorraine were told they were too old to adopt, and their last resort was paid surrogacy in Thailand. 

Finally after more than a decade, the couple finally had two beautiful babies they so desperately wanted.

'We're just over the moon we're just entirely in love and my wife is waiting as patiently as she can in Perth for their return as soon as possible,' David told Four Corners.

But since the Baby Gammy story broke their effort to bring home eight week old twins Liam and Joe was hampered.

While Lorraine travelled back to Australia to go back to work, the 52 year old lawyer from Perth, was left with the two babies and spent five weeks in Bangkok in a bid to fight to bring them to their new home.

His brother in Law, Brendan from England flew in to lend a hand as the two men struggled to get the right documentation to get them back to Australia.

'If I don't return to Australia, we may lose our house,' David told Four Corners.

'I've had less than a handful of hours sleep in the last few days .'

He went to court to try to get them to agree to let them fly back to Australia with the babies but that case was adjourned.

The only other option was to fly out with the baby's birth mother, but before they could, they needed all the documentation.

That took a couple of painstaking days before finally the men could return to Australia and the couple were reunited together and were able to live a normal life with their two new babies.

Luckily for gay couple James and Danny Carrington they were able to leave Thailand with twins Elijah and Hannah who were born in Bangkok in May.

They were one of the last to leave Thailand before a number of Australian couples involved in surrogacy were stopped and told they couldn't leave the country. 

'I think we both cried I don't think we were allowed to hold them for 24 hours and when we went back to the nursery the next day we were actually allowed to hold them and feed them,' James told Four Corners.

'There were people from america, Canada, people from China, Israel, Taiwan and it was quite amazing, we're talking eight or nine Australian surrogate children a day going through the embassy.'

David Markovic's brother in law Brendan from England came out to help with the two twins, Liam and Joe, after Lorraine had to leave to go back to work in Australia. The trouble started after the 'Baby Gammy' case was exposed

The story also exposed the unfair deal most Thai surrogate mothers are receiving through agencies that pocket most of the money.

'If intending parents actually develop contact with the surrogate they will become aware perhaps of the terms of her contract,' said Dr Anne Gallagher.

'It's very difficult to argue that commercial surrogacy is the not sale of children and Australia has an international legal obligation and in fact to prevent the sale of children,' she said. 

Thai Surrogacy agent Joy told Four Corners she was traumatised by the baby gammy case and quit the business because of it.

'This journey is not easy. It is not like any other business in the world. I couldn't even call it a business because it's a lot of emotion, it's not only about money,' she said.

In Australia commercial surrogacy is banned and unregulated in the Northern Territory.

But chief judge John Pascoe believes commercial surrogacy should be allowed in the country, regulated in Australia and banned in other overseas countries. 

'If commercial surrogacy is allowed with proper regulation in Australia to protect the rights of all parties then we simply have a law that prevents a law of surrogacy children being brought back to Australia,' he told Four Corners.

David Markovic also believes Australia needs a proper national enquiry, that looks at all aspects of surrogacy.
