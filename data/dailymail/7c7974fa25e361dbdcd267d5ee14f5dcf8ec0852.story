David Luiz aimed fire at a boxing bag after scoring his first league goal for Paris-Saint Germain against Evian on the weekend.

Luiz shared a video on Instagram which shows off his boxing prowess as the club’s marquee signing looks to continue his bright start to life in the French capital.

The 27-year-old is renowned for his tenacious defending and has now shown he can control his aggression off the pitch too.

He was wearing red gloves alongside a red PSG vest with black shorts as the bag was held for him as he threw punches at a black boxing bag.

The Brazilian is fighting fit as he also looks forward to a reunion with his former club Chelsea in the Champions League.

The Blues overcame the French side in last season's quarter-finals, prevailing on away goals after a 2-0 home win followed a 3-1 loss in Paris.

The last 16 tie mirrors the format of last year’s quarter-final as PSG will welcome the Blues to the Parc des Princes for the first leg at the end of February, before the two teams face each other at Stamford Bridge in March.

Luiz’s most notable contribution for PSG in the Champions League, was when he opened the scoring in a 3-2 win against Barcelona.

He joined PSG from Chelsea for £50m in the summer, a world record fee for a defender and signed on a five-year-deal.

The centre-back recently was given a surprise inclusion in the FIFA World Team of the Year.
