Police are on the hunt for the twisted culprit who stole the baby Jesus from a Nativity in Haverhill, Massachusetts and replaced it with severed pigs head on Christmas morning.

The figure of a baby Jesus was taken from a Nativity scene outside the Scared Hearts Church during the early hours on Christmas morning.

It was replaced by a hairy pig's head, and not the kind that one would find at the butcher store.

Sick theft: The figure of a baby Jesus was taken from a Nativity scene outside the Scared Hearts Church during the early hours on Christmas morning

Replaced: 'This particular pig is not the kind of pig that would be sold at a butcher shop,' Lieutenant Robert P. Pistone, a spokesman for the Haverhill Police Department said of the sick baby Jesus replacement

Fresh: The pig appears to have been freshly decapitated, said police who still don't know who could have committed the act of theft and vandalism on Christmas 

Haverhill Police held a press conference this morning to discuss the offensive theft.

'This particular pig is not the kind of pig that would be sold at a butcher shop,' Lieutenant Robert P. Pistone, a spokesman for the Haverhill Police Department said.

'Usually they would remove all the hair,' he added.

Pistone also said that the pig was likely 'freshly decapitated,' and that it may have come from a local farm.

'It's just a really hurtful commentary on society,' Pastor John Delaney told Fox today.

'And for someone to do this sad deed is really shocking.'

This act of vandalism resembles one that happened at another church in Haverhill a few years ago in which a mysterious suspect left a few decapitated pig heads.

Members of the church were hurt deeply by the incident this holiday season.

'They're heartbroken, they're horrified, they're outraged by this act that really speaks to us on this most solemn day of hurt,' Delaney said.

Despite being hurt, residents gathered in support of the church, one even bringing a new baby Jesus to decorate the Nativity. 

Mystery: Police are calling upon farms and butchers to report any missing sheep or suspicious purchases 

Hurt:  'They're heartbroken, they're horrified, they're outraged by this act that really speaks to us on this most solemn day of hurt,' Pastor John Delaneylaney said on the congregants' response
