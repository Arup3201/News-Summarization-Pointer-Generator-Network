With the pressure of qualifying for the last 16 of the World Cup no longer on their shoulders, England stars Daniel Sturridge, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jordan Henderson enjoyed a relaxing afternoon in Rio on Saturday.

The Three Lions trio swapped their sports drinks for exotic coconut water at a coastal cafe after training with the rest of Roy Hodgson's squad at the Urca military base.

Sturridge and Henderson played in last Thursday's disappointing 2-1 defeat to Uruguay, but the Liverpool pair appeared to be in much better spirits than when they trudged off the pitch in Sao Paulo.

Hodgson and his squad face the prospect of an almost meaningless game with surprise package Costa Rica on Tuesday before they can fly home.

Oxlade-Chamberlain could get his first taste of World Cup action in Belo Horizonte after being ruled out of the defeats to Italy and Uruguay with a knee injury.

Hodgson is likely to make changes to his starting XI for final game of the tournament, with youngsters Ross Barkley and Luke Shaw both in line to start.Â
