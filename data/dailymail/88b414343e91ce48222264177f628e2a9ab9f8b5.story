Nicole Pisani quit her job as a chef at a top London restaurant to make exotic school dinners

A top chef at one of London's most exclusive restaurants has quit her job to make exotic school dinners for just 92p a head.

Nicole Pisani made a name for herself as chef de cuisine at Nopi - a fashionable, Asian-inspired restaurant in Soho owned by Yotam Ottolenghi - but resigned after tiring of 80-hour weeks in a demanding kitchen.

Tomorrow she starts what is arguably an even more challenging job - preparing lunch for 500 hungry schoolchildren on a tiny budget. 

Ms Pisani - who is used to creating exquisite dishes such as tea-smoked lamb cutlet with jalapeño salsa, and seared tuna with tender-stem broccoli - will take on a school dinners menu which includes the likes of pizza and spaghetti bolognese.

But the chef is looking to tear up the menu at Gayhurst Community School in Hackney, north-east London, with the primary school children to be served dishes including sweet potato and spinach dhal muffins, and fresh salmon goujons.

After quitting from her job at Nopi, Ms Pisani set about looking for a new challenge.

A friend spotted a tweet from restaurateur Henry Dimbleby, which said the chef at his son's school had left and asked if anyone was interested in applying for the job.

Ms Pisani handed in her CV and was called in to cook a trial meal, which went down well with staff and children, the Guardian reported. 

She said: 'I had an amazing time at Nopi. It was a massive learning experience for me. But after two-and-a-half years I was tired. I wanted a break. It's hard being on your feet for 16 hours a day.'

Ms Pisani, who is keen for the children to eat from plates as opposed to plastic trays, said she was looking forward to her new, 'rewarding' job. 

'I want to try and stick to the same menu they have, but cook it better,' she said.

'In school kitchens the mentality is they are cooks, not chefs. But it would be really nice to have people who love cooking in schools. I've always loved feeding people. It's a profession, but the idea that you feed someone is so rewarding.'

The current menu at the inner-city school includes wholegrain pasta with bolognese, pizza with salad and cauliflower cheese.

From tomorrow, however, this will change. Pupils will be served sweet potato and spinach dhal muffin cake, with celeriac and parsnip, smashed beetroot and labneh - a type of Greek yoghurt.

On Friday, children will have a choice of salmon goujons or cheese and butternut squash quiche, with peashoots, sour cream and corn salsa. 

Ms Pisani is even planning to introduce clams and seaweed to the menu, but says she will hold off more exotic ingredients for the time being, instead focusing on persuading the 150 children who bring in lunchboxes to switch to school dinners.
