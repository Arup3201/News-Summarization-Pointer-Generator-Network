The parents of WPc Yvonne Fletcher have laid flowers on the spot where she was shot dead 30 years ago today and demanded justice for their murdered daughter.

The 25-year-old was gunned down outside the Libyan embassy by one of Colonel Gaddafi's henchmen on April 17 1984 and the person responsible has never been caught.

Her mother and father Tim and Queenie were among mourners at a memorial service in St James Square and said it is 'time this case was closed'.

'Here we are 30 years later, having 
dealt with numerous governments and a dozen or more foreign secretaries 
and it seems no closer to achieving justice for Yvonne,' they said.

It emerged today MI6 may be 
closing in on a 'prime suspect', who may be hiding in Egypt having fled 
Libya after the collapse of Gaddafi's regime in 2011.

Emotional: Her parents and immediate family held eachother as they laid flowers on the spot where she was killed by shots fired from inside the Libyan embassy

Crime: WPc Fletcher was hit when bullets were sprayed from the first floor window of the embassy, but the person responsible has evaded justice

Miss Fletcher was one of 50 officers 
policing a protest against Colonel Gaddafi's regime outside the embassy 
when she was hit by a burst of gunfire from a first-floor window.

The dictator had sent a message the embassy the night before asking his agents to 'cover the streets of London with blood'.

Investigators
 believe the bullets, which killed her and injured 10 protesters, was 
fired by a sniper who intended to hit protesting Libyan dissidents.

In a statement released today her family said: 'Thirty years ago today, Yvonne was shot and killed outside the Libyan People's Bureau in St James's Square. To many it may seem like a fading memory but to the family it is as clear as yesterday.

'We have had to move on with our lives but it is difficult to move forward when the past remains unresolved. Closure is important to the family so that we can remember Yvonne as the happy caring person she was.

'Our desire for justice is as strong as ever and we continue to support the Metropolitan Police in their ongoing investigation. The truth about what happened 30 years ago is just as important to us today as it was then and we call upon the current Libyan government to enable the police to complete its investigation.

'It is time this case was closed, 30 years of being in the news and dealing with the pressure of media attention takes its toll on all the family, more than you will ever know.'

Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe told the memorial service: 'At the end of the day, Yvonne Fletcher's parents lost their daughter.

'Her sister lost a sister. We lost a colleague, and we're determined to make sure we catch the person responsible,' he said.

Response: WPc Fletcher's parents stood alongside Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, who reiterated his desire to bring the killer to justice

Met leadership: Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe spoke at the service while Britain's most senior female officer, Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick, also paid her respects

It also emerged today that British agents are closing in on a suspect in the 1984 murder.

A report has revealed MI6 have put relatives and associates of the man under 24-hour surveillance in Libya.

Her death led to an 11-day siege of the building and the severing of diplomatic links between the UK and Libya.

No-one
 has ever been brought to justice for the killing but Scotland Yard 
detectives have never given up hope of identifying the culprit.

MI6 officers have reportedly been talking to officials in Tripoli about the suspect, a former Libyan official, believed to be in his late 50s, following the downfall of Colonel Gaddafi.

It is thought he may be hiding in Egypt under the protection of the fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood movement.

A source close to the investigation told the Daily Mirror: 'This is a very significant development in the inquiry.

'The MI6 officersâ€™ task is to liaise with local people to find the killers of Yvonne Fletcher. The Yard wants it settled and to announce the coup by the end of the year since it has gone on for so long.'

The Foreign Office confirmed that British police had also been to Libya to talk about the case and said developments were expected.

'Helping the Metropolitan Police Service take forward their investigation into the murder of PC Fletcher is a priority. We continue to provide the police whatever support we can,' a spokesman said.

'We are pleased the Metropolitan Police Service were able to return to Tripoli earlier this year to continue building cooperation on this case with the new Libyan authorities.

'We expected to see follow-up soon.'

The police officer's mother Queenie, 80, told the Mirror that 'things are happening'.

'The Government knows the names of the people involved. I worry about them getting proof and that the proof will still be there.

'I have waited a long time. We shall see if they get it. I want justice.'

Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe will attend a memorial service today to mark the 30-year anniversary of the murder.

Members of WPc Fletcher's family will join her friends and colleagues in remembering the officer, who was shot dead outside Libya's London embassy on April 17, 1984.

They are expected to lay floral tributes to the 25-year-old at the spot where she was gunned down in St James's Square.

A memorial to Ms Fletcher was unveiled there by the then prime minister Margaret Thatcher in 1985.

No one has ever been brought to justice for the murder of policewoman Yvonne Fletcher, who was shot dead outside Libya's London embassy on April 17, 1984.

Here is a timeline of events following her death:

April 17, 1984

Wpc Yvonne Fletcher, 25, is shot by a sniper while policing a protest outside the Libyan embassy in St James's Square, London, and 11 students are wounded.

She is pronounced dead shortly afterwards at Westminster Hospital. Her killer is thought to have been smuggled out of the country and back to Libya after the shooting. Her death leads to an 11-day siege of the building and the severing of diplomatic links between the UK and Libya.

1999

The Libyan government accepts 'general responsibility' for the killing and agrees to pay compensation to Wpc Fletcher's family. British detectives also fly to Libya around that time to interview suspects but reportedly got little help.

2004

Efforts to investigate the killing are stepped up when then Prime Minister Tony Blair meets Colonel Gaddafi after he agrees to dismantle his country's weapons of mass destruction.

April 2007

A report into Wpc Fletcher's death names the man who fired the fatal shot but concludes there is not enough evidence to bring a murder charge.

June 2007

British detectives are able to interview the chief suspect for the first time following the normalisation of political ties with Libya. Detectives spend seven weeks in Libya interviewing witnesses and suspects.

September 2009

It emerges that the Foreign Office has conceded that any trial for the shooting will take place in Tripoli. It is reported that the agreement was struck three years previously, when trade deals worth hundreds of millions of pounds were being negotiated. Campaigners for Wpc Fletcher's family brand the matter 'an absolute disgrace'.

February 2011

Major political protests begin in Libya against Gaddafi's government and civil war breaks out.

August 2011

The Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC) says that Abdulqadir alBaghdadi, one of the suspects for Wpc Fletcher's murder, has been shot in the head. Junior diplomat Abdulmagid Salah Ameri, who was suspected of firing the fatal shots, is also thought to have died. The last named suspect in the killing believed to be still alive is Matouk Mohammed Matouk.

October 20, 2011

Gaddafi dies after being captured by rebel troops, leading to scenes of wild jubilation in the country he formerly ruled as well as across the world. His death leads to new hope that Wpc Fletcher's killer will be brought to justice.

November 2011

A senior British diplomat says he is confident that Scotland Yard detectives will soon be allowed to visit Libya.

May 24, 2012

Prime Minister David Cameron announces that a Metropolitan Police team is to fly to Libya to continue the investigation after discussing the matter with the country's interim Prime Minister Abdurrahim ElKeib during a visit to Downing Street. Mr ElKeib promises Libya will "work very closely' with the UK.

May 25, 2012

Mr ElKeib visits the spot where Wpc Fletcher died and leaves a wreath of white roses and carnations.

May 26, 2012

Mr ElKeib tells the Guardian Abdullah alSenussi, one of Gaddafi's most senior henchmen who is wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity, is the "black box" who knows who carried out the killing. 'I guarantee he was almost directly or indirectly involved in most if not all of the crimes (of the Gaddafi regime),' he tells the paper. 'That doesn't mean others weren't involved. But he definitely knows who they were.'

June 14, 2012

Scotland Yard says two detectives from its counterterrorism team have visited Tripoli where they met Libyan officials for 'preliminary discussions' about how the investigation can be taken forward.
