Out: Michael Campbell has withdrawn from US Open

Michael Campbell has announced he will not return to the scene of his US Open triumph at Pinehurst next month after separating from his wife.

Campbell, who held off Tiger Woods to win his first major title in 2005, said he is not 'mentally ready' to play competitive golf and will also miss next week's BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth.

In a statement on his personal website, the 45-year-old wrote: 'Sorry I have been off the radar since playing at the 2014 Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship.

'I have had some problems with a tendon in my left ankle that stopped me from playing for two to three months. The good news is that I am back swinging and now managing to play 18 holes. "

'In a personal note, I have some sad news. Unfortunately Julie and I have separated. Our children remain our number one focus as we move forwards - as parents first and foremost while remaining both friends and business partners.

'As I do not feel that I am either fully physically or mentally ready to play tournament golf at the highest level, after much deliberation I have decided not to play in the BMW PGA Championship, the US Open or the events in between. I want to get back to my best and I believe this is the best strategy to achieve this.

'I look forward to seeing you all out on the course later in the summer!'

Campbell's victory at Pinehurst made him the first New Zealander to win a major since Bob Charles in 1963, with his country's parliament suspended in order to watch the drama unfold in the final round.

He also beat Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley in the final of the World Match Play Championship at Wentworth later that year, but has not won since and made just five cuts on the European Tour last season.
