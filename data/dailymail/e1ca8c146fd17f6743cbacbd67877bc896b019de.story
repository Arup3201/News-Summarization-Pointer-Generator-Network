One of Robin Williams' most notable film roles was Patch Adams, where he played a medical student who helped his patients by making them laugh with his zany antics.

However, the actor, like the character he portrayed, also had a heart-warming dedication to helping patients after the cameras stopped rolling.

Family members of those he comforted have paid tribute to the 63-year-old, who was found dead in his San Francisco mansion at around noon yesterday.

Garry Kravit, whose nephew David Buist was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of cancer called hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma, called the star a 'comedic Mother Theresa'.

The best medicine: Robin Williams in Patch Adams, where he played a doctor who helped patients by making them laugh. The actor showed extaordinary kindness to real-life child patients

David bravely decided that he wanted to see a new Ronald McDonald House - a charity that provides accommodation for families with children in hospital - built in New York before anything happened to him.

Kravit met Robin Williams at an event and asked him for autographed items for their fund-raising efforts. Williams went much farther and started calling David to help keep his spirits up as his condition deteriorated.

'When David was suffering at his worst, Robin would call him to perk him up. David treasured Robin's calls and it helped to push him forward,' Mr Kravit said.

Williams even invited the pair to a filming of a comedy special in New York in 2004.

'He hugged him and spent 20 minutes with him. He didn't care about anything but David,' Kravit told CNN.

Buist eventually beat his cancer and is now married with children.

Another relative of a cancer sufferer, Mark Cole, reminisced about the star's generosity of spirit.

His 13-year-old daughter Jessica had an incurable brain tumour and, as a huge fan of Mrs Doubtfire, requested a visit to see Williams through the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

Kind: Williams in the film Old Dogs. During filming he helped an extra struggling with a heavy golf bag

But she became too ill to make the trip, so the actor chartered a private plane to her Greensboro, North Carolina, home, where he spent the day with the teenager.

'I couldn't believe it,' Mr Cole said. 'I felt very privileged that he came to spend the day with her like that. It was the most moving thing I've ever seen in my life.'

Jessica died two weeks later.

Numerous stories about his kindness have emerged since his apparent suicide.

Susan Jeffer was an extra hired to play golf in the background of 'Old Dogs', starring Robin Williams.

After filming had finished, the strap on her golf bag broke and she had to carry it across the course in the hot sun.

The only person to help her was the Oscar winner, who, knowing she would get in trouble if she was seen being helped by the star, carried the bag but handed it back just before they reached the rest of the actors and crew.

She said: 'He really saved me that day. I'll never forget it.'

Canadian comedy actor Will Arnett, who appeared in the 2006 road comedy RV with Williams, spoke about William's kind-heartedness last night on TV talk show Conan.

He said: 'As funny as he was - he's one of the all-time greats - he was even better as a person.

'He was just the loveliest and one of the kindest guys that anyone ever worked with.'
