Many Americans who were held hostage during the Iranian revolution have spoken out against the nuclear deal recently brokered with Iran saying that it is a mistake to trust the controversial Middle Eastern regime.

A number of the hostages, including Clair Cortland Barnes, see the negotiations now as no more effective than they were in 1979 and 1980, when he and others languished, facing mock executions and other torments.

'It's kind of like Jimmy Carter all over again,' said Mr Barnes, now retired and living in Leland, North Carolina, after a career at the CIA and elsewhere.

Taken outside to display to the crowds: One of the 66 Americans held hostage in the American Embassy in Tehran was walked around the compounds on November 9, 1979, five days after the ordeal began

Chaotic: A majority of the hostages were held for 444 days and it was the end of diplomatic relations with Iran

The hostage crisis began in November 1979 when militants stormed the United States Embassy in Tehran and seized its occupants. In all, 66 were taken hostage.

Thirteen were released less than three weeks later in 1979; one was released in July 1980; the remaining 52 were released January 20, 1981.

Downfall: The Iranian hostage crisis was cited as the lowest point of then-President Jimmy Carter's term

Retired Air Force Col. Thomas E. Schaefer, 83, called the deal 'foolishness.'

'My personal view is, I never found an Iranian leader I can trust,' he said.

'I don't think today it's any different from when I was there. None of them, I think, can be trusted. Why make an agreement with people you can't trust?'

Schaefer was a military attache in Iran who was among those held hostage. He now lives in Scottsdale, Arizona, with his wife of more than 60 years, Anita, who also takes a dim view of the agreement.

‘We are probably not very Christian-like when it comes to all this,' she said.

The weekend agreement between Iran and six world powers — the U.S., Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany — is to temporarily halt parts of Tehran's disputed nuclear program and allow for more intrusive international monitoring of Iran's facilities.

In exchange, Iran gains some modest relief from stiff economic sanctions and a pledge from Obama that no new penalties will be levied during the six months.

To be sure, the former hostages have varying views. Victor Tomseth, 72, a retired diplomat from Vienna, Virginia, sees the pact as a positive first step.

Tomseth, who was a political counselor at the embassy in Tehran in 1979, had written a diplomatic cable months before the hostage crisis warning about the difficulties of negotiation with the Iranians.

A long memory: Former hostage Thomas E. Schaefer, 83, thinks that time has not changed the Iranian leadership. 'My personal view is, I never found an Iranian leader I can trust,' he said

Still, he said in a phone interview Monday that it is possible to cut a mutually beneficial deal with them.

'The challenge is Iranian society and politics is so fragmented that it's difficult to reach a consensus,' he said — a problem that is also present in the U.S.

He said he considers the deal 'in a category of an initial confidence measure.'

John Limbert, 70, of Arlington, who was a political officer held hostage during the crisis and later became deputy assistant secretary of state for Iran in 2009 and 2010, also supports the deal.

He said he does not view it in terms of whether Iran can be trusted, but whether the regime recognizes that a deal is in their own interest.

'I would say there is a consensus among the leadership, and the consensus is, “We like to stay in power. We like our palaces,”’ Limbert said.

‘We've seen the alternatives in Egypt and Tunisia,’ he argued, citing other areas where established regimes have been toppled.

Hopeful: Victor Tomseth, 72, a retired diplomat from Virginia who was part of the group held for 444 days, sees the new nuclear pact as a positive first step

He said it's a mistake to be overly pessimistic about the prospects for a deal.

'If we and the Iranians could never agree, then Victor and I and all our colleagues would still be in Tehran,' he said.

'The problem has been that our reality has been for the last 34 years that anything the other side proposed, you could never accept because by definition it had to be bad for us, because otherwise why would they propose it?'

For other hostages, though, their experience has led them to the conclusion that attempting to negotiate and expecting Iran to live up to its end of the bargain is a losing proposition.

Sgt. Rodney 'Rocky' Sickmann, 56, of St. Louis, then a Marine sergeant, remembers clearly being told by his captors that their goal was to use the hostages to humiliate the American government, and he suspects this interim deal is in that vein.

Clair Cortland Barnes, a former hostage, sees the negotiations now as no more effective than they were in 1979 and 1980 when he and others languished, facing mock executions and other torments

'It just hurts. We negotiated for 444 days and not one time did they agree to anything ... and here they beg for us to negotiate and we do,' he said.

'It's hard to swallow. We negotiate with our enemies and stab our allies in the back. That doesn't seem good.'

The deal may also have a direct effect on some of the hostages who have long fought to sue the Iranian government for damages. The new agreement calls for $4.2billion in frozen Iranian assets to be released, which could make it more difficult to collect a judgment on any successful lawsuit.

'And what do we get out of it?' asked Barnes.

'A lie saying, “We're not going to make plutonium.” It's a win-win for them and it's a lose-lose for us.'
