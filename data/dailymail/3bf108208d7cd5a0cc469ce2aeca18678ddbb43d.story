A mother-of-three who is believed to have been killed by her 'jealous husband' in a 'murder-suicide' suffered multiple stab wounds, while he was found with just a single knife injury, a post mortem has revealed.

Hayley Stringer, 29, and her estranged husband David, 32, were discovered dead at a house in Walsall in the West Midlands, while their three daughters Chloe, 11, Chelsea, eight, and seven-year-old Lottie slept upstairs.

West Midlands Police have now said they 'strongly believe' David killed his ex-wife before turning the knife on himself.

Neighbours revealed the married couple 
had split up just three weeks earlier and Mrs Stringer had recently started a 
relationship with 19-year-old Matthew Read.

The teenager was arrested in connection with the investigation but has since been released without charge.

Last night the 19-year-old from Cannock in Staffordshire, who Mrs Stringer is thought to have met at work, declined to comment.

He is understood to have told police that he came back to the property after a night shift and discovered the two dead bodies.

Detective Inspector Justin Spanner, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Hayley suffered multiple stab injuries and David died from a single stab wound.

Estranged: The couple, whose daughters aged 11, eight and seven were unhurt, had split earlier this year, and Mrs Stringer had started a relationship with a younger man, neighbours said

'At this stage we strongly believe that this is a murder-suicide.

'While we are still to establish the 
exact circumstances of what happened on Saturday morning, we are 
currently not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths.'

Andrew Dutton, whose partner Lisa Ball is David’s cousin, said the pair had been together for about eight years but had recently had a 'fallout'.

He added: 'We are just absolutely devastated, not just for David. Our prayers go out to Hayley’s family, David’s family and the kids.

'David was a lovely kid. He was very quiet, shy, hardworking and a devoted father.

'It’s just so shocking. The family have been through so much stress lately.

'Apparently, in the last few weeks they have had a fallout and she’s gone with the 19-year-old.'

One neighbour of Mrs Stringer has spoken of how she was woken early on Saturday by a woman’s screams.

She added: ‘That must have been Hayley. It was awful – it’s been on my mind all the time since.

Annette
 Johnson, 60, said she too had been woken up by the sound of a woman's 
screams shortly after midnight, and had then seen the flashing blue 
lights of police cars at around 4am.

Tributes: Bouquets of flowers were left outside the couple's home by shocked friends

'I knew Hayley and the girls very well and would speak to them quite a lot,' she said.

'I didn't know David as well because he worked a lot but I would still say hello or wave to him.

'Hayley was lovely, she was always talking to people and had time for everyone.

'They moved here about three years ago, I don't know where they came from. They seemed to be a normal happy family.'

Mrs Johnson said she had heard of the couple's split, but she had not spoken to Mrs Stringer about it.

'I saw that she was in a relationship with this young lad on Facebook too,' she said.

Investigation: The floral tributes were left alongside the red-brick home as officers continued to search the property for clues as to how the couple met their death

'I would see them walking together in the street but I don't know if he was living there.

'It is just so sad for the girls. The oldest one starts big school next year and she won't get a uniform bought from her mother. It's tragic.'

Another neighbour said Mrs Stringer had ‘kicked out’ her husband only three weeks ago adding: ‘We’ve heard David came back.’

Although Mr Stringer, who worked for a metal importing and distribution company, was not the natural father of Chloe, neighbours said he raised her as his own.

The father had changed his Facebook profile picture to a picture of his three ‘angels’ fewer than three weeks ago.

On her Facebook page, Mrs Stringer - who worked for Spanish-owned engineering firm Gestamp Automocion in Cannock, Staffordshire - had listed herself as being in a new relationship with bespectacled Mr Read in April.

Murder scene: A man and woman have have been found dead with stab wounds, at a house in Walsall

Post mortem examinations of the bodies were due to be conducted yesterday, with the results expected to be released tomorrow.

Mr Stringer, who was a darts fan, has a twin sister Zoe and a younger sister, Natalie, 31, who were both too upset to comment yesterday.

Chloe’s father is Dean Gallagher from Burntwood, Staffordshire. He did not return messages last night.

Police officers also recovered a weapon at the house.

Detectives have been carrying out house to house enquiries and forensics officers are at the scene in a bid to try and establish what happened.

The three children are being cared for by family members and specialist family liaison officers are also supporting the victim's families.

DI Corfield added: 'Two families have experienced a tragedy and three young girls have been robbed of a mother. Our thoughts remain with them today.

'So that we can provide much needed answers for them and the local community a large team of detectives, forensic examiners and others from West Midlands Police are working really hard to get to the bottom of what happened.

Evidence: A car is carried away from the scene and a murder inquiry has been launched by West Midlands Police

'We're keeping an open mind as to what took place inside the house and are exploring a number of possibilities.

'If we're to get to the truth I'd ask anyone with information which may move the investigation forward to call us. Please don't assume that someone will have already told us what you know or what you've heard.'

Shocked friends and neighbours had placed bouquets of flowers outside the home.

One of the floral tributes from Mr Stringer's work colleagues wrote: 'RIP Dave & Hayley. From the lads at Holme Dodsworth' - a metal importing and distribution company that he lists as his job on his Facebook page.

Another tribute read: 'Dave mate so sorry you've gone. One of the nicest blokes I've ever met.'

And a third card left outside the house added: 'Our hearts are filled with sorrow. Nothing can ever take away the love of a good friend and fond memories linger of the good times with you and your girls.

'To the girls thinking of you now your mom and dad are angles watching over you. RIP.'
