A varsity high school basketball player, with two prosthetic limbs, is now allowed back on the court -- after his school benched him over concerns he might hurt other players.

Bailey Roby, 18, who plays for Mountain Vista High School in Highlands Ranch, was born with fibular hemimelia - meaning there is no fibula in either leg - and with three toes on each of his feet, The Denver Post reports. Roby's legs were amputated when we was 7 months old and received prosthetic limbs at age 1.

Roby normally played toward the end of boys' varsity basketball games, according to 9 News. Prior to being benched, he played in 7 games this season, totaling 9 points and attempted 12 of his 13 shots from behind the 3-point line, Yahoo! Sports reports.

Roby, seen here during the varsity Jan. 24 game, previously played on a special mixed team including special needs students -- until his skills earned him a spot on the junior varsity team last year

Bailey Roby, center, is seen playing on January 24. The Roby family had to pick up the special blue padding on his prosthetics the same day as the game 'otherwise he wouldn't be able to play,' according to his mother

That was before Roby was told he could not play before a January 14th game, the Denver Post reports. The next day after meeting with school officials, Colorado High School Activities Association (CHSAA) did not approve his eligibility.

On Thursday, the CHSAA issued a new statement, saying Roby will be allowed to play on a game-by-game basis.

'Bailey Roby will be permitted to play in games, so long as there is an agreement in place between both schools involved to ensure the situation on the floor remains safe for all participants,' it reads. 'CHSAA will consider approving this participation on a game-by-game basis.'

Officials were previously concerned that Roby's prosthetic legs might pose a safety risk on the court. He is now allowed to play on a game-by-game basis

The CHSAA was concerned over Roby's eligibility and a national high school basketball association rule which states 'The referee shall not permit any team member to wear equipment or apparel which, in his/her judgment, is dangerous or confusing to other players or is not appropriate [...] the accommodations should not fundamentally alter the sport, heighten risk to the athlete/others or place opponents at a disadvantage.'

Roby, who is 6-foot-3 but stands an extra two inches taller on his prosthetic legs, played on a school team that includes special needs students until he earned a spot on the junior varsity team last year, The Denver Post reports. The CHSAA gave him a letter of authorization when safety concerns were brought up.

Roby played in Friday's game against Douglas County -- with Mountain Vista winning 75-59. Though Roby missed his only shot,Â  he was more than happy to be on the court, according to 9 News.

'I'm just glad I'm back on the court to play, make some threes, do some layups and block...I get to play again,' he told the channel.
