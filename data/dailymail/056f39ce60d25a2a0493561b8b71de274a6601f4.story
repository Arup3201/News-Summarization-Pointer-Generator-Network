She is known to recycle her designer outfits with a great deal of panache. But the Duchess of Cambridge is also fond of a good bargain – and can be found rifling through the 60 per cent off sale rack at Bicester designer outlet village in Oxfordshire, according to sales guru Mark Ellwood.

Having trawled the world's shopping outlets, Mark had it confirmed that the future Queen of England is particularly fond of sales at UK high-street store Reiss.

During a visit to Bicester in February 
while doing research for his new book, Bargain Fever: How to Shop in a 
Discounted World, Mark told MailOnline: 'I went into Reiss to buy a 
sweater I bought at retail in navy, and they had it in brown for £20.

'I got chatting to a beautiful English rose behind the counter and asked why they were so many Chinese shoppers in the store - there are no Reiss stores in China - and she said: "Oh, it’s Kate Middleton – she’s in here all the time."

'She said, "You look up and there’ll be Kate and her same two friends going through the 60 per cent off rack. You have no idea she's there and security must be outside, but she comes in all the time. And she's totally different to the Prince of Thailand, who I heard shut down a restaurant and brought his own staff when he visited Bicester."'

It’s not the first time that the Duchess of Cambridge has been linked with Bicester.

Speaking to Sadiah Bte Shahal, the 
wife of Singaporean senior parliamentary secretary for the ministry of 
defence, Maliki Osman, on the first day of her and the Duke of 
Cambridge's nine-day tour of the Far East last September, the new mother
said she 'loved' the discount shopping destination as 'everything is so
contained.'

While in March 2012 it was revealed that
she had bought a stylish blue coat dress from the Missoni outlet shop 
in the village, as well as a scarf. At the time an assistant at the 
store told Grazia: 'Kate bought the dress here. We were all surprised to see her and it was great to see her wearing it alongside the Queen and Duchess of Cornwall.'

Mark said: 'The future Queen of England can't take anything free, she cannot endorse anything.

'I love this image of people going to Bicester and getting a sighting of the future Queen of England.'

'You look up and there’ll be Kate and her same two friends going through the 60 per cent off rack'

And
it's not just the Duchess who loves a bargain, as Mark points out: 'Lady
Gaga tweeted, "Why do people look at me like I'm crazy when I use 
coupons at grocery or try bargaining at retail, IM FROM NEW YORK WHERE 
IS THE SALE RACK [sic]"'

Delving
into celebrity shopping secrets, Mark said: 'A friend of mine used to 
work at Hermes and Martha Stewart is one of the biggest clients at their
boutique and also at their sample sale. '

'But
what Martha would do is send a flunkey to send in line for the sample 
sale and they had to call when they were near the front and then Martha 
would take their place in line and go in.

'It's getting mad now. With the 
Christian Louboutin sale, there's not just a VIP day, but a celebrity 
day, there were pap shots of Blake Lively carrying bags and bags away. 
And this sample sale is the Shangri La of sample sales.'

However,
when it comes to one celeb who won't take a freebie, Mark said: 
'Another friend of mine styled Jada Pinkett and she tried on a bracelet 
and said "this is beautiful" – this is normally celebrity code for "give it to me". But she said: "How much is it," he replied $50,000 and 
she said "could you work on the price and invoice us?" – she paid for 
everything.'

Brit-born Mark was inspired to pen his book after noticing the steady stream of sales in stores.

He
said: 'Ten years ago, retailers sold between 10 and 15 per cent of 
their inventory at some sort of promotion - today they sell between 40 
and 45 per cent at promotion.

Shopping guru: Paying full price is so passé, says Mark Ellwood

'I was walking around and seeing lots of sales signs and when I shopped online I felt like an idiot if I hadn't found a coupon code, somehow I felt robbed! I wanted to know if there was something behind this and went to a researcher who gave me the numbers and I felt this was a fascinating story of how sales have doubled and why this has happened.'

He joked: 'My mother's Scottish, she puts two five pound notes in her wallet and she thinks they're like giant pandas and if she looks away they might breed! I grew up very comfortably, but my mother takes great pride in her value driven-ness, she's very Scottish.'

During his research for his book, Mark said he discovered: 'There is no reason to pay full price ever and there is no reason to accept full price – and if you do, you're a fool. You can always find a way to get a legal discount. Do you pay cash? Do you ask nicely? There is always an angle.'

It was after moving to New York from London 15 years ago that Mark discovered his passion for a bargain at the Strand bookstore in Manhattan, where you can find 'dusty half-price books'.And it wasn't long after that that he discovered the shopping nirvana that is Century 21 in the city.

He revealed: 'I go to Century 21 twice a year, the first two weeks of February and the first two week of August. That's when the showrooms clear out the backlog of that season's inventory. Twice a year it's a piñata of goodies… The rest of the year go for towels and socks!

'You go three times a week at 8.30am you go and look only for the names of the brands that you like - you don't browse - buy everything you like in any size that might fit and take it home. At the end of two weeks, go through everything you've bought, try it on and then take back whatever doesn't fit.'

When it comes to online shopping, Mark has a tried and tested formula: 'It's cart abandonment. You have to treat shopping online like a date with someone new and cute, you mustn't put out on the first date. Instead, put the item in the cart, close the window, wait for it to go on sale and you'll create your own bargain.'

In exploring the world of bargains, Mark
also unveiled the ploys that major 'high end middle market' chains use 
to draw shoppers.

Using J Crew as an example, he said: 'J Crew is one of my favorite brands, but they have decoy products in their stores, which exist solely to make everything else seem cheaper.

'J Crew launched the J Crew collection with a $900 blouse and everyone asked, "who would buy that?" But NO-ONE'S  going to buy it – it's not meant to sell, it's meant to make the $200 blouses that used to be $150 seem cheaper.

'J Crew puts expensive decoy products in stores, which exist solely to 
make everything else seem cheaper'

'The J Crew collection is sprinkled throughout the stores, with the $350 dress next to the $200 dress to make it look cheaper. Shoppers are being manipulated and you have to be aware.

'We have this crazy irrational reaction to money - we don't think logically. If you get $5 off something, that goes into a magical pot that's no longer real money, you can spend it on anything... If it was still in your bank account you'd treat it like normal money, but this is weird bonus money.'

He advised: 'Every sales assistant wants to make their four per cent commission and you have to start thinking "they want to sell me this."

'Start visiting your favourite stores, make friends, learn when the assistants work and buy a little cheap thing, full price. They need to know that if they look after you they will have a guaranteed sales stream.

'Then they'll invite you to the pre-sale, which is the secret sale that happens BEFORE the sale. By the time the sale signs go up now anything good is gone. So pre-sale you take your loyalists and you offer the sale to them.

'There is always a discount to be had.'
