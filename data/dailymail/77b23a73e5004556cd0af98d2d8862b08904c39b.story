The chairman of the education trust at the centre of the alleged 'Trojan Horse' Muslim takeover plot in Birmingham schools has resigned along with his entire board of trustees.

Tahir Alam, of the Park View Educational Trust, made the announcement today outside the gates of Park View Academy in Alum Rock, Birmingham.

The trust has been the focus of allegations made in the anonymous Trojan Horse letter - now widely held to be a hoax - alleging the existence of a clique of hardline Muslims attempting to seize control of Birmingham schools.

Tahir Alam has been accused of being part of the Trojan Horse plot to take over Birmingham Schools

Those allegations triggered several inquiries and last month the trust's three schools were placed in special measures by Ofsted.

Mr Alam has always denied any wrongdoing and branded the investigations 'a witch hunt'.

His resignation comes the day after teachers at a Bradford comprehensive were suspended after clashing with governors who allegedly wanted to institute a similar system in their schools.

Mr Alam launched a scathing attack on outgoing Education Secretary Michael Gove, Ofsted and others, as he announced he would be standing down.

After four months of inspections and scrutiny, the capacity of the trust's three schools - Park View, Golden Hillock and Nansen - to continue to offer an outstanding education 'is at risk of being seriously compromised', he said.

'We believe strongly that we have justice on our side, and we know we have the support of many from within and outside Birmingham, including our students, parents and members of staff,' Mr Alam said.

'However, we are not prepared to subject our school communities to the further period of intense and bitter pressure that our continuing as members of Park View Educational Trust will see them face.

'And it is for this reason, and with a deep sense of injustice and sadness, that today we are announcing our intention to resign our positions at Park View Educational Trust and allow new people to assume responsibility with the aim of continuing the success of our schools.'

Mr Alam said the reputation of Park View School had been brought to the point of destruction, and the effect on the communities of the allegations and investigations had been 'appalling'.

In a statement, Mr Alam said he and the trust's other trustees were 'immensely proud' of the role they had played in improving Park View and raising achievement at Nansen and Golden Hillock.
