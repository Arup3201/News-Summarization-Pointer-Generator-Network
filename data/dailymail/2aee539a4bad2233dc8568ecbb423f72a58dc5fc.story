Paedophile Gareth French, 47, who was jailed for 12 years for brutally stabbing a schoolboy in the street and sexually assaulting a young girl

A schoolboy was left with his intestines hanging from his stomach after being brutally stabbed by a paedophile on the run.

Gareth French, 47, attacked the boy, who he did not know, with a bread knife, after being confronted by the father of a girl he sexually abused.

The boy, 17, lay bleeding on the ground but managed to call for help on his mobile phone.

The teenager underwent a four-hour operation to repair his liver, colon and other internal organs, a court heard.

French was jailed for 12 years today after admitting the 'random' street attack and sex assaults on a young girl.

The court heard how French armed himself with a bread knife after being confronted by the father of the young girl and stormed out of his home where he saw the 17-year-old boy and stabbed him three times in the abdomen.

Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard French had never met the boy before and saw him by chance in the street.

Prosecutor John Ryan said: 'French armed himself with a bread knife after being confronted by the girl’s father.

'After leaving his home he saw the boy who was a stranger visiting relatives in the area.

'He stabbed him in a random street attack.

'The boy’s intestines were protruding from his abdomen but he was able to call the emergency services for help.'

The 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was left scarred for life by the horrific knife wounds.

French ran off after the attack but made a call to the emergency services saying he thought he might have killed someone.

When he was arrested he asked the officer: 'Is he dead? I stabbed him three times.'

French, of Aberdare, South Wales, admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent and causing a child under the age of 13 to engage in sexual activity.

The court heard the schoolboy was 'deeply affected' by the attack, both emotionally and physically.

Jane Rowley, defending, said it had been a spontaneous attack on a stranger with no background history or hostility.

She said: 'He did not arm himself with the intention of going out to do it'.

Judge John Curran ordered French to sign the Sex Offender Register for life and said he was disqualified from working with children.
