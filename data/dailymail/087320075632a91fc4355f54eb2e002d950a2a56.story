The victim allegedly molested by Stephen Collins was shocked into sharing her story after reading his sordid novels, it has emerged.

The woman - who has not been named - claims that the actor molested her between the aged of 11 and 13, but says she kept quiet about it for years.

However, the experience of reading two highly sexualized novels by Collins in 2000 inspired the woman to write an anonymous message to his wife Faye Grant.

Revelations: Stephen Collins, pictured above with wife Faye Grant, allegedly abused the victim in the 1970s, who spoke out after reading his sexualized novels 

The message described the alleged molestation, and warned that he was capable of doing it to more people, according to TMZ.

According to the reports, it was not until 2012 that the woman reported the alleged incidents to police.

The novels in question are Eye Contact, published in 1994, and Double Exposure, from 1998. 

Collins's website - which has now been replaced with a holding page - was until this week advertising both novels on his website, but has posted warnings describing them as 'not appropriate' for his younger fans.

Eye Contact, which a former neighbor of Collins called 'semi-pornographic', is the story of a sex-crazed actress who seduces men she meets in public places.

One conquest  - however - proves more than she can handle, and the woman ends up standing accused of murder.

Meanwhile, Double Exposure charts the chaotic life of a television insider overwhelmed by lust for an attractive new neighbor he spies through his window. The relationship descends into kidnappings and violence, ending it what reviews call a 'forcibly twisted climax'.

New York City police announced this week that they have an open investigation into allegations Stephen Collins molested a teenage girl in the early 1970s.

The complaint was filed in 2012 accusing Collins of forcing a 14-year-old girl to commit a lewd act in the actor's Manhattan apartment in 1972.

An NYPD spokesman said the case remains open and is being handled by Special Victims Division detectives, but no charges have been filed.

Faye Grant wrote in a sworn court declaration in Los Angeles last year that her husband had disclosed he molested at least three young girls, including a relative.

Grant wrote in the November 2012 declaration in the couple's divorce case that she reported abuse to Los Angeles police, who said they are not actively investigating the actor, but could not offer details on any previous investigations 

‘Stephen admitted that he has engaged in a long-term pattern of sexually abusing minor children, including sexually molesting three young girls over a decade ago,’ Grant wrote in the sworn declaration, which was filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court in November.

The report to New York police was made six months after Collins filed to divorce Grant, whom he married in 1985.

Grant and Collins separated in February 2012, about two weeks after the actress said she learned of her husband's alleged pedophilia in therapy sessions, according to her declaration. Collins filed for divorce three months after the separation. 

In the divorce filings obtained by MailOnline, Grant claims her husband used his fame to trick abused children.

'I believe that Stephen used his celebrity status to engender the trust of the families of the children he molested,' Grant wrote. 'I further believe that there have been other victims, but he has thus far only confessed to those three girls.

'I am particularly afraid of what may happen if he does not seek treatment, because he may be working or interacting with children in connection with his employment.'
