Four-four-two be or not to be, that is the question. The other question, of course, is can William Shakespeare help England win the World Cup?

Top coaches from the best academies in England descended upon the Tudor streets of Stratford-upon-Avon to discover how acting is taught at the Royal Shakespeare Company.

There were workshops about stage-fighting, lessons in voice projection, stage presence, posture and body language and they had a chance to quiz the team behind a production of Love’s Labour’s Lost, before watching them perform.

This much ado about coaching is all part of the Premier League’s long-term quest to develop more and better homegrown footballers by focusing on the creation of elite environments.

These same select coaches have also visited British Cycling at the Velodrome, the University of Bath - training base for many Olympians - and Athletic Bilbao. Next they are off to meet the SAS and the McLaren F1 team.

It is about taking them out of a comfort zone and challenging them to expand their minds beyond the confines of football.

‘Football has been happy to be comfortable,’ said Ryan Garry, who played for Bournemouth and now coaches Arsenal’s Under-13 team.

‘Other sports looked outside for information and research but football didn’t. This has opened doors for us to evaluate what we do, compare it others and refine our approach.’

All’s well that ends well at international level, too, where innovative coaching at club level is clearly rubbing off on the players of the future.

England Under 20s

The England Under 20s won a Four Nations Tournament in Holland in October, beating Holland and Germany.

England Under 19s

England Under 19s beat Belarus 3-0, Luxembourg 8-0 and Belgium 4-2 in European Championship qualifying in October (in Luxembourg).

England Under 18s

England Under 18s beat Holland twice, 4-1 and 3-1 at Leigh Sports Village and Bury on Sept 3 and Sept 5.

England Under 17s

England Under 17s won the European Championship in Malta in May.

The coaches were surprised to find plenty of common ground with the actors at the RSC, who discussed stage fright, coping with audience reaction and the balancing of individual expression and direction.

It was a far cry from Escape to Victory.

‘The voice coach talked about the muscles in the tongue, projecting your voice and enunciating clearly and how that affects people listening,’ explained Graeme Murty, once a full-back for Reading and Scotland and now coaching the Norwich Under-16 team.

‘The movement expert was phenomenal. She spoke about posture and the messages it sends. What style of communication am I using? How am I standing? What am I trying to project?’

At the Velodrome, they studied the training regime of double Olympic gold medallist Laura Trott and learned about the ‘marginal gains’ which have become the mantra of British Cycling.

‘It was the ultimate focus on small details,’ said Murty. ‘Does it make the bike go faster? We spoke to a cyclist on the podium programme for Rio who is taught how to eat and how to sleep.

‘We asked what happened if he missed a session and it was like: “Miss a session? What do you mean miss a session?” Normal people would call it obsessive, but it’s normal to them.’

At Bath they marvelled at how the swimming, judo, netball and bobsleigh athletes could all spark off each other and inspire.

‘The swimmers spend 24 hours a week in the pool,’ said Jon Harley, who started a long playing career at Chelsea and has returned to the club to coach the Under-15 team.

‘What they’ve produced results-wise at Bath is incredible and it’s because of the environment they’ve created.

‘It’s a discipline. They do that and it becomes a habit. All the coaches are very open, trying to drive each other on. You could see it was a world-leading environment for sport. In football it was always about doing the bare minimum and going home.’

These young coaches have been hand-picked by their clubs to participate in the Elite Coach Apprenticeship Scheme (ECAS), a two-year course which started last year - available to one individual from each of the 22 clubs with Category One Academy status.

As well as studying elite environments, each coach is assigned four mentors, which include high-profile experts from other sports - such as former England rugby union coach Brian Ashton and athletics coaching guru Malcolm Arnold.

The whole process has been deliberately kept in the shadows to give it space to evolve slowly.

It is a key element of the Elite Player Performance Plan (EPPP) - the brainchild of Ged Roddy, the Premier League’s director of youth.

‘This is not about copying another sport or another discipline but about stepping into these worlds and exploring how they do it and plotting our own path,’ said Roddy. ‘This is English football taking control of its own destiny.’

Three years after EPPP was launched, Roddy detects subtle signs of progress.

There was a call he took from a German friend amazed by the quality of young English players in a tournament he had seen.

And moments like the one in the Rose and Crown in Stratford, last week, when he and Neil Bath, Chelsea’s head of youth development, watched on television as teenager Dominic Solanke come on to make his debut in the Champions League against Maribor at Stamford Bridge.

Bath’s phone buzzed with messages from Stamford Bridge keeping him informed about Solanke’s progress: warming up, taking off tracksuit, putting on pads and coming on.

Youth development cannot be rushed. Slivers of satisfaction like these ones are what pass for reward.

‘We don’t know when it will tip,’ says Roddy. ‘We’re three years into a process that might take 16. Ultimately, the aim is to develop more and better players. To survive in the Premier League they must be among the best in the world.’

He is starting to believe the wheel is turning and cannot afford a backward step at this point. With some, this will rankle.

Clubs exist on the mid-slopes of football’s pyramid, where the EPPP has not been well received.

Some fear it will squeeze the life from those who sell to survive and encourage bigger clubs to chase players at ever younger ages because barriers have been removed and compensation figures are fixed on a sliding scale, depending on age.

One thing is sure, if English football waits for its powerbrokers to reach agreement it will be too late. So they all do what they think is best.

The Premier League, however, has the money - from around £8million spent by Stoke to upgrade their Academy facilities to the £200m spent by Manchester City to build a new training campus.

They are committed to EPPP as a means of developing local talent in hot-house environments built for elite sports and quelling the global scramble for the next Lionel Messi, thus ending the occasional clamour for more homegrown quotas.

‘The myth that you need to reach around the world is one we’ve been keen to counter,’ said Roddy. ‘While we always want the best talent in the world, there’s a balance to it. Bring talent in but recognise there is talent inside your own communities that can be among the best in the world.

‘Develop locally and recruit globally, but if you don’t get the environment right it doesn’t matter where they come from because you’ll fail. Physiology isn’t an issue. It comes down to coaching, environment, development of players — and that’s within our means to put right.’

The ECAS coaches have been to Athletic Bilbao, an interesting case study for development experts because they still operate a Basque-only policy and a finite talent pool, but have remained successful by blending the region’s spirit and grit with the right coaching practices.

It all comes back to environment, in Roddy’s mind.

That’s why he has the likes of Garry, Harley and Murty have been preparing for manoeuvres with the SAS by pretending to fight each other in the RSC’s Courtyard Theatre.
