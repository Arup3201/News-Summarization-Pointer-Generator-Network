Most drivers detest having to wait at roadworks traffic lights.

But this obedient pedestrian was more than happy to comply.

Walking along a country road in Coventry, the unnamed woman came to a stand still when she reached a sign ordering: 'when red light shows wait here'.

Obedient: This woman was pictured by Imogen O'Neill, 18, waiting until the light turned green to proceed

When the lights turned green, she carried on with her journey.

The photo, taken by a queuing driver, has now gone viral.

Imogen O'Neill, 18, was travelling home with her mother Ange at 2.45pm on Thursday when they spotted they unusual scene by Hearsall Common.

Miss O'Neill, a shop assistant, said: 'We were driving up to the roadworks when we saw this women walking up and then just standing at the traffic lights.

'I said to my mum "I think she's waiting at the traffic lights" but she didn't believe me at first.

'She was just laughing like it can't have been real.

'The
 woman just stood there waiting so I took a photo and then when the 
lights went green she carried on. I was just laughing so much.'

The picture, which she posted on Twitter, had 4,000 retweets and 3,500 favourites in just a few hours.

Comedian Russell Kane retweeted the scene, saying: 'SHE STOPPED WALKING'

Miss O'Neill added: 'I didn't expect the kind of reaction it got, it's been retweeted by loads of people.

'After it went so crazy online I felt really bad. I felt a bit sorry for her.

'But if it was me I might have felt stupid at first, but I would definitely have found it funny.'
