Samsung has revealed it hopes computers sewn into clothing could help take on Google’s Glass and Apple’s much-rumoured iWatch.

The electronics giant said it is ‘investing heavily’ in wearable computers and revealed it is even developing systems for stick on patches to monitor health.

‘Eventually you won’t even know you’re wearing the device, it could be the fabric in your clothing, your glasses or your watch,’ Samsung’s Chief Strategy Officer, Young Sogn, told the Mobilebeat conference in San Francisco.

The official Galaxy Gear looks similar to this 2009 concept of a Samsung smart watch, designed by Joseph Loetiko. The firm's mobile bosses confirmed in March it was working on a watch and the company's executive vice president confirmed the Galaxy Gear name in August

‘It will monitor your health, connect to the cloud, identify you, pay for things and replace credit cards.’

The firm is currently believed to be developing a range of wearable computers, including a watch.

‘In three or four years, the number of people wearing computers will increase dramatically,’ Mr Sogn said.

He believes that by 2020 the technology will be widely available.

Samsung has previously admitted it is developing a watch and a recent trademark filing suggested that Samsung's version would be called 'Gear'.

Samsung will battle Apple’s much-rumoured iWatch, and Google’s Glass wearable computer.

Developers say the technology is beginning to become acceptable.

‘I think we're starting to see devices that people actually want to wear, and we’ve seen a dramatic shift in how much sensors costs,’ said Jef Holove of Basis Point, a firm developing a computer watch.

Apple is believed to have 100 people working on its iWatch, according to recent rumours, but is hiring new members because the existing team have been unable to solve issues with the design and engineering. Here is MacUser magazine's mock-up of what the iWatch could look like

Samsung confirmed it was developing a watch to take on Apple's rumoured iWatch in March. 

The Korean giant let its plans slip 
during an interview - setting the scene for the arch-rivals to do battle
 in yet another market.

Experts
 believe both technology giant's watches will link to mobile phones and 
offer largely similar functions, such as the ability to show emails and 
download mini apps.

'We’ve been preparing the watch 
product for so long,' Lee Young Hee, executive vice president of 
Samsung’s mobile business, told Bloomberg during an interview in Seoul.

'We are working very hard to get ready for it.

'We are preparing products for the future, and the watch is definitely one of them.

'The issue here is who will first commercialize it so consumers can use it meaningfully,'

The Samsung device will perform many of the tasks of a smartphone, a source told Reuters earlier this year, without giving further details.

The source declined to be identified because Samsung did not want to reveal to the public any information about its new product line at this time.

Samsung announced earlier this year it was  'investing heavily' in wearable computers and revealed it is even developing systems for stick on patches to monitor health. Another of Samsung's watch concepts, pictured, shows a solid wooden band, and the watch face can be simply slipped out and put in a pocket when running

However, an earlier concept developed by by designer
Joseph Loetiko shows a watch than can be removed from its wristband when
 running or to answer a call, for example.

Shares
 in both Samsung and Apple have taken a hit as the world's top two 
mobile device manufacturers keep underwhelming consumers with their 
latest smartphone models.

Samsung
 shares dropped nearly 5 percent, or around $10 billion, in just two 
trading sessions after it launched its Galaxy S smartphone in March, partly hit by concerns that its flagship product lacks the 
'wow factor' and may not live up to expectations.

The Galaxy S4, unwrapped to much fanfare in New York to challenge Apple's iPhone on its home turf, offered some incremental evolutionary improvements, but media reports have since suggested these features may not be sufficient to excite buyers in an industry that lives and dies by innovation. 

The global watch industry is expected to generate 
more than $60 billion in sales this year, and rather like the mobile phone market, firms are expected to try and 'lock' consumers into their own ecosystem of apps and other downloads.

Samsung's watch concept can even be taken out of its strap to answer a call

'The
 race is on to redesign the mobile phone into something that you wear,' 
said Marshal Cohen, an analyst at NPD Group in Port Washington, New 
York.

'We’re going to see formidable competition coming from many 
different directions -- from device makers, accessory makers, even 
fashion designers.'

Samsung became the world’s largest smartphone maker last year, overtaking Apple. Samsung had 29 percent of global smartphone unit shipments in the fourth quarter, compared with 21 percent for Apple.

Experts believe the new watches could kickstart the mobile phone market, in the same way that the tablet market exploded when Apple introduced the iPad.
