A man suspected of shooting two South Texas police officers during a three-hour-long standoff Tuesday night is 'presumed dead' after officers raided the house in which he had barricaded himself and exchanged gunfire with him, authorities said.

Joaquin Cibrian, 29, a capital murder suspect, had been spraying bullets toward officers who were outside the house in the Rio Grande Valley town of La Joya.

The man was silenced just after 8pm on Tuesday evening after officers rammed the front door with an armoured vehicle, inserted tear gas and exchanged fire, Hidalgo County Sheriff Eddie Guerra said.

The man is 'presumed dead,' but that won't be confirmed until a bomb squad establishes that the house is not booby-trapped with explosives, as the man had suggested it would be, Guerra said.

The ordeal began about 4:45pm on Tuesday when a vehicle matching the description of one related to the killing of a 19-year-old Mexican national in Edinburg was sighted, Edinburg Police Chief Rolando Castaneda said.

The 19-year-old was found shot in the back of the head behind a vacant home in Edinburg last weekend.

Edinburg police responded and joined other agencies that had already tracked the vehicle to a La Joya home.

'As our officers were getting out of the car, the suspect ... opened up on our officers,' Castaneda said. 'One of my officers was shot in the arm. The other officer was shot in both legs and possibly a third time. He's in surgery right now. They're all doing fine.

'Arriving officers were able to rescue the two officers, throw them in their patrol car while under gunfire the whole time,' Castaneda said. 'Those officers were heroes.'

Armored vehicles were brought in to extract responding officers who were pinned behind their cars by gunfire, said Guerra.

Such was the danger posed by the suspect that nearby residents were ordered to evacuate their homes.

Negotiators were called in and made contact with the shooter. Guerra identified him only as the capital murder suspect on the day, but Police had earlier named Cibrian as the suspect.

The man told the negotiators he was ready to surrender.

'However, as he opened the door, he immediately engaged our personnel that were waiting to make the arrest,' Guerra said.

'He was contacted again, and he made arrangements to surrender again,' Guerra said. 'At that point, again, he engaged our officers with multiple shots. ... We decided that he was not going to give up, so we deployed an armored vehicle and rammed the front door and injected tear gas. At that point he came out firing.'

Officers returned fire, and the suspect was presumed dead, Guerra said. The bomb squad was checking the scene late Tuesday.

Edinburg police spokesman Lt Oscar Treviño said that Cibrian was a member of the feared Texas Syndicate gang and had several previous convictions, according to The Monitor.

The Syndicate, founded in 1970 in Folsom Prison, California, is run with a strict hierarchy and has over 4,400 members, some of whom have links with Mexican drug cartels.
