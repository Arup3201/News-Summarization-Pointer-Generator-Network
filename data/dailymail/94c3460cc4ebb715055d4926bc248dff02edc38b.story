A suspected paedophile who claims to 
have assaulted five girls in campsites hugely popular with British 
tourists was in custody in the south of France today.

The 32-year-old divorcee, who cannot 
be named for legal reasons, was due to appear before a judge in the city
of Avignon after being arrested on Friday.

His most recent alleged attack was on an 11-year-old girl on Wednesday.

Arrest: The entrance of a campsite in Saint-Didier-sous-Aubenas, France. The arrested man claims to have carried out sexual assaults on five girls in the area

The man broke into a tent where two children were sleeping, before nearby adults were alerted by screaming. 

Victims were able to draw a sketch of the man who is described as ‘bearded and suntanned’.

‘He acknowledges having taken part in
at least five attacks,’ added public prosecutor Franck Alzingre, who 
said the man had regularly preyed on young families across the region.

‘He confessed to attacking the 
11-year-old girl, and to similar assaults in the southern Ardeche. Five 
sites were targeted in all.’

Attack: A major investigation was launched following the rape of an 11-year-old girl in a tent at a campsite in the southern Ardeche region

Mr Alzingre said victims, who were of a number of nationalities, were in the age range seven to 12.

There had been earlier claims that 
the man had raped the children involved, but Mr Alzingre said 
prosecutors were now using the general term ‘sexual assault’.

Mr Alzingre, who is a prosecutor in 
the town of Privas, said the charges were so serious that he was 
relinquishing jurisdiction to the Avignon prosecutor. 

He said that evidence against the attacker was corroborated by a range of compelling evidence, including DNA.

The suspect, who is a divorced Frenchman, was arrested on Friday at 7pm close to his home in Brune, a small village near Privas.

Neighbours have reported seeing child pornography including images of rape on the man’s computer.

Police believe the man carried out all the attacks by posing as a holidaymaker who was staying on the campsites.

More than 20,000 British people 
travel by car to the Ardeche every year, many to take advantage of the 
cheap accommodation at some 337 campsites.

The first attack in the area took 
place in late June and the latest occurred on a campsite near the town 
of Saint-Didier-sous-Aubenas on Wednesday night.

Two of the victims were Dutch sisters
aged ten and 11, who were both attacked as they slept side by side in a
tent next to their parents.

Many of the major camp operators 
provide smaller separate tents for children by the side of larger adult 
ones, meaning youngsters sleep unsupervised.

French authorities have not confirmed
if any of the attacks have involved British children and the identities
of the victims have not been released for legal reasons.

A regional police spokesman said: 
‘All the attacks took place within 15 miles of each other, and the modus
operandi was always the same.

‘The attacker struck on young girls sleeping alone or with other children while their parents were in separate tents.’
