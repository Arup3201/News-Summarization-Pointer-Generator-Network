Many men are circumcised at an early age or have to undergo the procedure later in life for health reasons.

Now, a small but vociferous community of circumcised men is gathering online to discuss methods of ‘foreskin restoration’.

These men reportedly feel angry and resentful about the surgery and are looking to find methods of reversing it.

They are congregating on forums where they can vent their anger and discuss their options, The Kernel reports.

Typically, they are using websites such as foreskin-restoration.net and circumstitions.com

The Kernel reports that one man wrote: ‘I have been looking into what was stolen from me for a couple months now.

‘It’s always on my mind, I just revolve between being crushed emotionally and being soooo f**king mad I start twitching.

‘I just want to curl up into a ball and disappear. This is the most shameful/angry/sad/hateful/depressing feeling I’ve ever had.’

A response to this post encouraged this man to ‘commit to restoration’ so as to get back his control over his life and to increase his self-esteem.

The Kernel reports that most men who visit these sites do so because they are feeling either angry or shameful.

It claims these circumcised men feel sexually incomplete and that they are unable to achieve the same level of intimacy as can be experienced by uncircumcised men.

The sites offer a range of ideas as to how men can restore their foreskins without undergoing more surgery.
