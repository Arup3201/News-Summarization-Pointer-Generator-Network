A British tourist found dead in a hotel car park in eastern France is thought to have been murdered, police said today. 

The body of the unnamed victim, who was in his 50s, was lying in a pool of blood and had a large head wound.

He was found next to a budget Formule 1 hotel in the Epenottes industrial estate in Dole, a town in the Jura department of the Franche-Comte region.

The British trio had enjoyed drinks together at tables outside the hotel on Saturday night, according to staff, but detectives said the man had then gone out ‘to meet someone’.

‘He did not return,’ said a local police spokesman, who said an ‘initial theory was that he had been murdered’. 

The man’s wife called police on Sunday morning, and began looking for him with the help of hotel staff.

His body was found in a car park in front of an adjacent discount clothing store.

The police spokesman said: ‘The call to police was logged at around 9am. The victim’s wife was concerned about his whereabouts, as he had not been seen since Saturday night.’

Some 25 people have so far been interviewed in connection with the suspected crime, including hotel staff.

No weapons has been found, and police do not know how the head wound was caused.

CCTV has also been examined, but it is not thought to contain any important clues.

The couple were on their way back to the UK from Italy, with the friend, and had stopped off for the night in Dole, which is a short distance from the Swiss and Italian borders. 

It is used as a stopover for numerous drivers using the major motorways which link southern and northern France. 

The hotel - which charges £25 a night - was closed today, along with the car park, as forensics experts searched for clues. 

An autopsy was due to be held today. 

The British Embassy in Paris has been informed about the incident, and is liaising with the dead man’s family.

It is common practice for the French authorities to retain the names of accident or murder victims for operational reasons, but this practice has been criticised in the past by British police working on joint enquiries.

There is often a fear that vital information can be lost in the early days of an investigation if people do not know the name of the deceased, or what he looked like.
