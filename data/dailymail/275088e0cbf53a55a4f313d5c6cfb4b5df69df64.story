Humiliated: A key part of the evidence given by £332,900-a-year human resources director Lucy Adams (pictured) was shown to be false

The BBC’s leadership system is ‘broken’, a damning report  into the severance payoff scandal has concluded.

Publishing the findings of a five-month inquiry into the fiasco, the Commons public accounts committee said it had found ‘a failure at the most senior levels of the BBC’.

The committee’s chairman, Margaret Hodge, said she had uncovered ‘a culture of cronyism that allowed for the liberal use of licence fee payers’ money’.

MPs raised fears that some BBC figures may have lied to Parliament over the debacle – in which £369million was handed to departing staff over eight years.

Earlier this year, eight senior corporation figures – including its chairman and director general – were subjected to intense cross-examination as two parliamentary hearings sought to uncover the full extent of the payoffs.

But in today’s report, MPs said they feared some – including its £332,900-a-year human resources director Lucy Adams – may have deliberately misled the inquiry.

Miss Adams was humiliated in September when a key part of her evidence was shown to be false.

She had originally claimed to have no knowledge of an email about a £1million payment to former deputy director general Mark Byford, but later admitted she had in fact been one of its key authors.

The report said of her evidence: ‘We remain very concerned about the veracity of other parts of the oral evidence we heard. Misleading a select committee constitutes contempt of Parliament.’

In the three years to December 2012, the BBC handed £25million to 150 departing senior managers. In an internal email discovered by the PAC, Miss Adams referred to such payments as ‘sweetners’ [sic].

Asked to investigate the scandal, the National Audit Office found 22 of the 150 payments exceeded contractual limits, at a cost of £1.4million.

In his evidence to the committee, former director general Mark Thompson sought to justify a decision to hand Mr Byford £300,000 more than he was contractually owed by saying that he wanted to keep Mr Byford, a close friend, ‘fully focused’ until his departure.

But the PAC said such excessive payments were ‘unacceptable’ and identified a ‘prevailing culture in which cronyism was a factor that allowed for the liberal use of other people’s money’.

The committee also attacked the Corporation’s governing body, the BBC Trust, for failing to crack down on the scandal. 

It said: ‘Our examination of severance payments exposed a dysfunctional relationship between the BBC executive and the BBC Trust that casts doubt on the effectiveness of the BBC’s governance model... at present the governance model is broken.’

A BBC spokesman said director general Lord Hall has now capped the payments at £150,000.

The BBC Trust said: ‘We greatly regret that licence fee payers were let down by this episode. They are entitled to expect that their money is spent wisely.’

Mr Thompson said: ‘There is absolutely no evidence of any wrongdoing by anyone at the BBC in relation to these payments.’

The BBC spokesman added: ‘Lucy Adams made it clear to the committee that she did not attempt to mislead them and while not immediately recognising a document that was being referred to, she clarified her position as soon as Parliament returned.’
