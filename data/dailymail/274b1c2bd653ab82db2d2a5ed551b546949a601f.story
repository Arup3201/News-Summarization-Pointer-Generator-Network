Israel's Prime Minister has blasted the West for failing to condemn Iran after he unveiled a shipment of deadly weapons from the country.

Benjamin Netanyahu accused Britain and the US of 'hypocrisy' as few statements have been made about the stock of rockets and bullets allegedly bound for Palestinian militants.

The haul - including 40 M-302 rockets, 181 mortar shells, and 400,000 bullets - was discovered on March 5 by an Israeli commandos in the Red Sea.

Benjamin Netanyahu blasted the West's 'self-deception' as few statements are made about the haul

He addressed a press conference at Eilat naval base, south Israel, where 40 missiles, and 400,000 bullets were being held after commandos stormed an Iranian ship on March 5 - thought to be heading for Gaza

Standing beside cases of weaponry at a naval base in Eilat, south Israel, Mr Netanyahu said: 'At most I heard a few faint condemnations of Iran from the international community.

'In contrast, if we build a balcony in Jerusalem we hear harsh condemnation from the international community.'

The rockets are said to have come from Damascus via Tehran, where they were shipped on the Klos C vessel.

Mr Netanyahu told the press conference the haul was hidden by bags of cement.

Flanked by the defence minister and the army's deputy chief-of-staff, he said the shipment - rumbled by Israeli intelligence - was organised.

He added: 'There are those in the international community who would prefer that we were not holding this event today.

The KLOS C freighter was holding 40 M-302 rockets, more than 180 mortar shells, and 7.62 calibre bullets

Israel's Prime Minister blasted the US and Britain for condemning Israel's treatment of Palestine but only making faint condemnations of the weaponry that was shipped from Tehran hidden by cement bags

Journalists were transported to the naval base to see the haul and hear Mr Netanyahu's warning

He said world leaders must 'wake from their slumber' and take tougher action on Iran's weapon-building

'They feel uncomfortable that we are showing what is really happening in Iran. It's difficult for them to accept that we are exposing the truth behind the fake smile of Iran. They prefer to nurture the illusion that Iran has changed direction.'

Israel believes that Iran is trying to build a nuclear weapon, a charge Iran denies.

Israel says a nuclear-armed Iran would pose a threat to the existence of the Jewish state, citing Iranian calls for Israel's destruction, its development of long-range missiles and its support for militant groups.

Netanyahu has been an outspoken critic of the efforts by six world powers to negotiate a deal with Iran that would substantially scale back its nuclear program in exchange for ending international sanctions.

Israel believes Iran is trying to build a nuclear weapon, a charge Iran vehemently denies

Mr Netanyahu said a current interim agreement between Iran and the six powers is too lenient

He says a current, interim deal gives Iran too much relief while getting little in return, and fears a final agreement would leave Iran with the capability to make a bomb.

Since the global powers reached their interim deal with Iran last November, Netanyahu's warnings about Iran have been largely ignored by world leaders.

In the interview, which came following a meeting with President Barack Obama, Netanyahu pressed further.

'I don't just want Iran not to have a bomb. I don't want Iran to have the ability to make a bomb,' he said.

Flanked by the defence minister and the army's deputy chief-of-staff, Mr Netanyahu told the press conference the shipment - rumbled by Israeli intelligence - was highly organised

He said: 'If we build a balcony in Jerusalem we hear harsh condemnation from the international community'

'I don't outsource Israeli security.'

In a separate interview with America's Channel 2, part of a series that were the first Netanyahu granted to Israel media outlets in more than a year, the prime minister said he was prepared to reach a peace accord with the Palestinians so long as it marked an end to the conflict.

He added that while in was clear some Jewish settlements won't be part of a future peace accord, he would make sure the number left out 'will be as low as possible'.

He would not elaborate on the fate of these settlers.

More than 500,000 settlers live in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories that Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war and which the Palestinians hope will be part of their future state.
