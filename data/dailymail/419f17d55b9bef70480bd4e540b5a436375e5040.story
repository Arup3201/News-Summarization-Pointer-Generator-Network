It boasts a beautiful town centre and a wealth of history to explore.

But it turns out there’s another reason why tourists flock to York – it’s considered the world’s safest city.

And three more British towns – Bath, Edinburgh and Brighton – help make up the top four safest places.

York is considered the world's safest city, according to a new study which found only one per cent of people consider it to be risky

Cairo, Bangkok, Istanbul and Marrakech were the cities deemed most risky to visit on a short break.

The survey by Post Office Travel Insurance of 2,075 UK adults showed that 72 per cent felt York was safe, compared to one per cent considering it risky, and 26 per cent having no view.

In contrast, only seven per cent thought Cairo was safe – and 56 per cent felt it was dangerous to visit.

But London didn’t even make the top ten – with 58 per cent deeming the capital safe and 16 per cent risky.

A stolen wallet (24 per cent) was the most common occurrence for those who had had problems in cities.

As many as 26 per cent felt they had been ripped off on city visits, with this figure rising to 43 per cent among those aged 18-24.

Of the eight UK and Ireland destinations in the survey, the least-safe was Belfast with only 37 per cent deeming it safe. 

But although 53 per cent reckoned Manchester was safe, 20 per cent thought the city was risky - a higher figure than that for Belfast (19 per cent).

Venice, Vienna, Dublin, Florence, Stockholm and Copenhagen made up the rest of the top ten safest cities.
