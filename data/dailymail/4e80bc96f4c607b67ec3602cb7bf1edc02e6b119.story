Ryan Giggs is considering bringing the curtain down on his glittering Old Trafford career by cutting his ties with Manchester United.

The legendary winger, who signed his first professional contract on his 17th birthday in November, 1990, turned 40 last year and has increasingly been giving thought to whether he should continue playing for another season.

Sportsmail understands he is leaning towards hanging up his boots after becoming disillusioned by a lack of playing time.

Time's up: Ryan Giggs is set to hang up his boots at the end of the season after a glittering career at Manchester United

Moving on: Giggs is giving serious consideration to leaving Old Trafford and proving himself at another club

In a further stunning development, he is giving serious consideration to quitting his coaching role under manager David Moyes and leaving Old Trafford altogether at the end of this season.

Such a move would send shock waves through Old Trafford after the one-club winger was drafted on to Moyes' coaching staff in what was seen as a step towards grooming him for a possible elevation to the manager's job in years to come.

But Giggs is not only ready to end one of the most decorated playing careers in recent memory but make a clean break and continue his coaching badge away from United, in the hope of starting afresh and proving himself at another club.

Old Trafford bosses are bracing themselves for a decision from Giggs, who made his debut as substitute for full-back Denis Irwin in a 2-0 home defeat to Everton on March 2, 1991 and went on to win every honour in the game.
