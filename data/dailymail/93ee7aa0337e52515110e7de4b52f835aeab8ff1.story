In a stunning speech on the Fox News Channel, commentator Greg Gutfeld predicted that if a bank taxation scheme like the one that shocked Cypriots should come to America, gun owners would aim at government officials -- and shoot to kill.

'While Cypriots can own guns, it’s a bear to get them,' Gutfeld noted on the popular talk show The Five.

'There is no 
gun culture there, which then allows the government to wonder of its 
docile populace: "What are they gonna do -- shoot us?"'

'Well, in America,' he sniped, 'yes, we will shoot you.'

The cast of Fox News Channel's The Five includes (L to R) Andrea Tantaros, Bob Beckel, Eric Bolling, Dana Perino and (far right) The Joy Of Hate author Greg Gutfeld, who predicted 'war' if US government officials ever levied taxes on existing bank accounts

Gutfeld, who also 
hosts the late night news-comedy show Red Eye, is author of the 
snark-filled book The Joy Of Hate.

Americans learned Monday that Cypriots would be subject to a 6.75 per cent tax on bank accounts of €100,000 ($129,500) and below. Amounts above €100,000 will incur a 9.9 per cent tax, which goes up to 15 per cent for balances over €500,000 ($647,000).

'The wholesale robbery has caused citizens to rush to get their money out. The response? The banks closed. So how can a government assume that it can get away with this? Because they assume they can get away with this.'

'Gun control advocates mock gun owners over their belief that guns will protect us from government tyranny,' said the popular Fox News host. 'But ask yourself this: What would happen if the government here tried to take over your bank account? War. It would be on.'

The Second Amendment to the US Constitution guarantees that 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.'

But new gun 
control measures have popped up at the state and federal level in the wake of the December Newtown, Connecticut school shooting, which left 20 children and six adults dead.

Among the advocates of tighter restrictions on guns is Vice President Joe Biden, who claimed during a Feb. 19 Facebook event that women could protect themselves from attackers by firing a loaded shotgun into the air.

Gutfeld isn't impressed. 

Gutfeld said Americans would revolt with their firearms and shoot government officials if the US economy ever needed a bailout like the one that the EU has extended to Cyprus. That plan requires a tax on all bank accounts in the country, seizing as much as 15 per cent of account holders' money

Vice President Joe Biden (right) has supported bans on the sale of high-powered rifles, telling women they should fire shotguns into the air to scare off attackers

'Cyprus just proved that Joe Biden's notion of "all you need is a shotgun" is deeply flawed,' he said. 'Sadly, though, this "steal from the rich" mentality is alive and well in America. Remember Occupy Wall Street? And how different is the Cyprus solution from the class warfare rhetoric that demands your wealth gets spread around?

'The defense against this toxic ideology isn't only reason, but it's reason with a rifle. So, yeah, it'll never happen here. And you have the good sense of our founding fathers to thank for it.'

Biden's advice about firing shotgun warning-shots became the subject of a YouTube parody video, showing women knocked backward by the force of firing a shotgun. It quickly racked up 1.6 million views.
