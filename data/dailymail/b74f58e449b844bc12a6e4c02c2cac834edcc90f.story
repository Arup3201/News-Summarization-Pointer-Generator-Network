John Quinn, who launches an attack on both the English and Irish Cesarewitch this weekend, believes he has found a reason for top two-year-old The Wow Signal running way below his best in the Prix Jean Luc Lagardere at Longchamp on Sunday.

Quinn runs Swnymor, whose odds with Ladbrokes have halved in the last week to 12-1, at Newmarket on Saturday and will saddle Triumph Hurdle fifth Rutherglen in Sunday’s Irish Cesarewitch at the Curragh.

The Frankie Dettori-ridden Wow Signal, already a Group One winner in the Prix Morny, started favourite for the Lagardere but looked very laboured as he dropped away.

Quinn said: ‘He didn’t scope too clean after the race and is a bit jaded. We will build him back up and probably look to run him in one of the Guineas trials, either the Greenham or the Craven Stakes.’

Meanwhile, James Fanshawe’s Prix Cadran winner High Jinx, an entry in the Horses In Training Sales, will be heading back to France to run in the Prix Royal Oak.
