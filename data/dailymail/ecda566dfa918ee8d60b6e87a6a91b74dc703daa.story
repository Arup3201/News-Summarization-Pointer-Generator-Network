Aaron Hernandez will go on trial for first-degree murder in early January - but you wouldn't know it from the former football star's jovial demeanor during Tuesday's court hearing.

The 24-year-old former New England Patriot-turned-murder suspect smirked and grinned while standing next to his attorney in Bristol Superior Court in Fall River today.

Jury selection would get under way January 9, 2015, first step in the legal process that will determine the athlete’s responsibility in the shooting death of Odin L. Lloyd in 2013.

Something to smile about? Aaron Hernandez, 24, wore a big smile on his face during a court hearing Tuesday when he learned that one of his murder trials will get under way in January 2015

Wheels of justice: Jury will be selected from a pool of 1,000 candidates over the course of several days beginning January 9

Judge Susan Garsh said jurors would be selected from a pool of 1,000 people brought in over several days.

Mr Hernandez appeared in high spirits during an earlier hearing last month when another judge informed him that he is to spend a year in jail before going a trial in ay 2015 for an unrelated 2012 drive-by shooting that left two strangers dead. 

Also on Tuesday, Hernandez's lawyer Michael Fee said that a dispute over records the defense had sought from the New England Patriots has been resolved, though it's unclear whether the documents were turned over.

That prompted the cancellation of a separate hearing before a different judge that was scheduled for the afternoon.

Defense attorneys declined to comment outside court. The Patriots' attorney, Andrew Phelan, referred questions to team spokesman Stacey James, who said the team had no comment.

The Patriots had agreed to turn over 317 pages of personnel records sought by the defense, including medical and training records.

But the team objected to producing nine pages of scouting reports and a one-and-a-half page summary of a psychological assessment produced by an outside company.

Hernandez, 24, has pleaded not guilty to murder in the June 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd, a semi-professional football player from Boston who had been dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee.

Lloyd's bullet-riddled body was found in an industrial area not far from Hernandez's North Attleborough, Massachusetts, home.

The team released Hernandez on the day of his arrest.

The defense had called Hernandez's full team records necessary to prepare for trial, and said they may contain critical information about the former player's state of mind.

Phelan, meanwhile, had accused Hernandez's attorneys of being on a 'fishing expedition.' He said the scouting reports contained trade secrets and were irrelevant to the case.

He also said the Patriots had offered the defense the option of reviewing, but not copying, the psychological assessment summary.

The team wanted the defense to get the assessment from the company that wrote it, which provides character and mental assessments to professional sports organizations.

Hernandez, who is from Bristol, Connecticut, has pleaded not guilty, in a separate case, to the murder of Safiro Furtado and Daniel de Abreu in Boston in 2012. He's being held without bail.
