Whenever Cristiano Ronaldo’s exit from Real Madrid back into the arms of Manchester United has started to look like a possibility in recent years there has always been a minority who have dared to ask: ‘He’s nearly 30 now, would they still want him?’

Now he's turned 30, the age that for so long marked the watershed between a player’s prime and his decline, and yet there are no signs of any slowing down.

He was due to take time off from the daily round of 3,000 sit-ups to celebrate with friends and family at his Madrid home in the luxury complex of ‘La Finca’ in the Spanish capital on Wednesday night.

Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates his 30th birthday on Thursday and Real Madrid posted this montage

Cesare Maldini  - Former Italy coach, born 1932.

Sven Goran Eriksson  - Former England and Manchester City manager, born 1948.

Gheorghe Hagi  - Former Romania and Barcelona striker, now retired, born 1965.

Carlos Tevez  - Juventus striker, born 1984.

Jordan Rhodes - Blackburn and Scotland striker, born 1990.

Neymar - Barcelona and Brazil striker, born 1992.

Adnan Januzaj - Manchester United winger, born 1995 

The trappings of superstardom are always in evidence at these events. Last year he hired the magician Dynamo to do a few tricks for his son Ronaldo Jnr. This year DJ Red One had been hired to provide the music and if New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady had turned up to get pass the parcel started, no one would have been surprised.

Ronaldo has reached levels of global superstardom that would have been difficult to foresee when he first arrived at Old Trafford in 2003. 

‘He is the greatest sportsman ever,’ says his agent Jorge Mendes, who this week reminded everyone that his number one client’s buy-out clause is set at £1billion.

Yet while some players allow the fame and fortune to diminish their hunger for on-the-field success, Ronaldo seems as intent on setting records and winning trophies at 30 as he was at 20 when he was just two years into that Manchester United career.

When he picked up his third Ballon d’Or in January there was an: ‘I’m coming for you’ message to Leo Messi who still has one more FIFA World Player award. This year’s challenge is to become one of the first group of players to retain the Champions League. And he is slowly climbing the list of all-time goalscorers at Real Madrid where Raul awaits him at the summit.

‘Cristiano Ronaldo will play at the highest level until he is 40’ Mendes told Spanish radio recently. ‘He will still be scoring 30 goals with his head a season when he is 39 years old. The way he manages his life, what he eats and how he rests is an example to all.’

It is part of Mendes’ job to praise his player but the predictions for the future were intriguingly specific. The mention of 30 ‘headed’ goals perhaps comes from an appreciation that while eventually the blistering pace might fade other qualities will not.

He started out as a winger, then became a winger who could play at centre-forward. He could comfortably end up as just an out and out centre-forward, and a formidable one at that. The finisher’s instinct, the precision from penalties and the talent for spectacular free-kicks will all be unaffected by the advancing years.

Almost as impressive as the drive to go on improving has been the way he has handled the transition from a star at United to a global icon at Real Madrid. Last year he became the first sportsman to reach 100million fans on his Facebook page as well as over 31m Twitter followers.

Back in 2003 when he turned up for his first training session at Manchester United, Mark Zuckerberg was still a year away from launching Facebook, when the fan mail came back then, it came in the post. But in Mendes’ care Ronaldo has proved himself the perfect modern footballer off the pitch as well as on it.

The move to Madrid took the image to another level. The signs were there right from the start when he registered the trademark CR7 before he had even started wearing the No 7 shirt at the Santiago Bernabeu. When Raul left at the end of Ronaldo’s first season the shirt number finally fitted the brand.

Madrid has embraced Cristiano the male model as much as Ronaldo the footballer. A one hundred-foot-high billboard poster of him modelling his latest line of CR7 underpants in the city’s municipal hall two years ago was proof of that.

When he first arrived at Manchester United, Ronaldo had a reputation of going to ground too easily

Ronaldo replaced David Beckham at Manchester United but at Madrid he has replaced the former England captain off the pitch as Real’s most marketable star. In a deal that runs to 2020, adidas pay Madrid £31m a year for the privilege of seeing Nike’s biggest client wear the adidas logo every weekend. Ronaldo himself earns around £5m a year from Nike.

He has more than tripled his income from sponsors since being in Spain, earning around £20m a year from brands as diverse as Castrol, Emporio Armani, and Banco Espiritu Santo.

Real Madrid president Florentino Perez used to say that he would sell the stadium before selling Beckham, the sentiment is the same towards Ronaldo. That might explain the insistence that Gareth Bale’s transfer to the club in 2013 was for less than the club paid for Ronaldo.

Ronaldo quickly changed his ways at Old Trafford and became one of the biggest stars at the club

And when too many people started to believe that Bale was indeed Real’s most expensive-ever acquisition, Real made sure that Ronaldo was the highest earner in history by putting his pay up to £15m a year net with a new five-year deal just a month after Bale’s signing.

The deal which works out at around £280,000 a week is some pay rise especially when looking back to 2013 he was angling for a new contract at United that would see him move to £120,000 a week. Many back then were asking: ‘Is he really worth it?’ Just as at 30 some might ask: ‘Can he still do it?’ 

Perez and Mendes would no doubt answer: ‘yes he is’ and ‘yes he can’.
