Tesco has banned an entire school from one of its stores following a spate of stealing.

Pupils have been warned they will be marched off the premises by security guards if they set foot in their local branch.

Managers in Kettering, Northamptonshire, have put up signs saying: 'No children from Kettering Science Academy allowed in the store unless with an adult.'

As well as barring the 1,400 pupils, 
the store has told shoppers they must remove caps, hoodies and motorbike
helmets. The action follows thefts and the abuse of staff.

Parents claimed their children were 
being victimised. The mother of a boy of 14, said: 'I'm disgusted. We 
often ask him to bring home a pint of milk or a loaf of bread. He goes 
to church, he doesn't shoplift so why should he be barred?'

Another mother said: 'There are a minority of bad pupils but the majority are being victimised.'

Staff at the Tesco Express say they 
have been spat at and threatened. One worker, who did not want to be 
named, said: 'It's not fair or right that staff should have to put up 
with abuse from these yobs.'

'It’s not fair or right that staff should have to put up with abuse from these yobs,' one worker said.

'You see them coming into the store and abusing the staff who are just trying to do their job.

'There
have been occasions where pupils have spat at staff and sworn at them. 
These kids might be young but they are out of control.

Formal: A sign in the store's window makes the decision clear

'Staff have been told that if they see 
pupils in the shop on their own to contact security and they will be 
escorted off the premises. It might seem extreme but staff must feel 
safe at work.'

The school is a joint primary and secondary school with pupils aged between three and 18.

Signs at the store said: 'No children from Kettering Science Academy allowed in the store unless with an adult'.

One mother, whose 14-year-old son attends the school, criticised the supermarket’s decision.

'I’m disgusted that my son won’t be allowed into the store any more,' she said.

'We often ask him to bring home a pint of milk or a loaf of bread on his way home.

'He goes to church, he doesn’t shoplift or anything so why should he be barred too?

'I don’t think Tesco should be allowed to do this.'

Another mother added: 'There are a minority of bad pupils who cause the trouble but the majority are being victimised.'

The supermarket defended the ban.

A Tesco spokesman said: 'Our stores exist to serve customers and so restricting people from shops is always a last resort.

'We are taking these measures in this instance following a spate of thefts and intimidation of our staff, which is unacceptable.

Unfair: Parents say that the decision is 'disgusting' and that students are being victimised

'We have discussed this matter with the school and the local police and hope to see a resolution to this issue soon.'

College principal Martin Campbell claims they have been helping Tesco find the culprits

'We have helped the supermarket potentially identify a number of individuals who they may be taking legal action against,' he said.

'This issue lies with Tesco and if this is what they believe is the right course of action then that is up to them.

'It is not unusual for shops near schools to put signs up or employ security guards.'

And this afternoon Tesco revealed that the ban has been lifted.

'Following constructive discussions with the school yesterday, the ban was lifted and we hope this matter has now been resolved,' a spokesman said.

'The ban was only ever a temporary measure, as we will not tolerate intimidation of our staff or disruption for customers. We will continue to work with the school and will monitor the new arrangements.'
