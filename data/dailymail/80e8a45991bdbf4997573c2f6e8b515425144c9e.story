A Swiss coffee company has been forced to withdraw novelty milk lids featuring the image of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler after they were spotted by German businessmen in a city centre cafe.

Lids showing the faces of Hitler and Mussolini were spotted by a group Germans while having a coffee break in a cafe in the city of Coire, in the eastern Swiss region of Graubunden.

The plastic take-away packaging showing the fascist dictators' portraits inside a gold frame were distributed by Switzerland's largest supermarket chain Migros.

Coffee cream lids featuring Hitler and Mussolini caused outrage after being handed out  in a cafe in Switzerland

Christian Shuster, 47, from Germany, who was on a business trip in Switzerland said: 'Our Swiss colleagues took us down to the coffee shop and when the waitress brought them over we saw the face of Hitler staring up at us from one of the cream containers.

'I couldn't believe it and at first thought it was some sort of sick joke being played by my colleagues.

'But then we saw the other containers also had the face of Hitler on and some had Mussolini.

'This is just absolutely evil and outrageous.'

The cream lids were also found at a takeaway food kiosk in Switzerland's northern Aargau region.

Shocked customers complained in droves after being handed them with their takeaway coffees.

Kiosk owner Albert Erni, 33, said: 'To be honest, I hadn't even looked at them so when people started complaining I wasn't sure what they were talking about.

'But then I looked and, yes, was pretty shocked too.

'It seems like a very bizarre and distasteful piece of marketing.'

In Switzerland, labels from the mini-cream containers are collectibles, and producers often seek new and inventive ways to enhance their appeal.

Tristan Cerf, a spokesman for Migros, said the mishap had occurred when an outside company asked ELSA, a dairy manufacturer and Migros subsidiary, to supply a series of 55 coffee cream containers based on vintage cigar labels, two of which featured the dictators.

He said that the outside company had provided the controversial designs, and that ELSA typically produced plastic creamers with charming and innocuous images on them - not fascists.

He said: 'I can't tell you how these labels got past our controls. Usually the labels have pleasant images like trains, landscapes and dogs - nothing polemic that can pose a problem.'

Switzerland has in the past been forced to grapple with its relationship with the Nazis during World War II, including accusations that Swiss banks abetted the National Socialist regime.

But Cerf emphasised that the accidental circulation of the plastic Hitler creamers had nothing to do with the country's social mores, but rather reflected an isolated mistake. 

Speaking about his company's cream pots, Cerf said: 'Whoever made this mistake was not thinking properly as these aren't meant to be images for a book about World War II, but rather something meant to be enjoyed with coffee and a chocolate cake.

Confirming that the sale and distribution of the product has been stopped, he added: 'You cannot put Pol Pot or a terrorist on a milk creamer. It is unacceptable.'
