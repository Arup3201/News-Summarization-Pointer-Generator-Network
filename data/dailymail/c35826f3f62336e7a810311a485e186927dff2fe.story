Cristiano Ronaldo may have the Ballon d'Or on his shelf, but the Real Madrid star has been beaten by Barcelona rival Andres Iniesta to the 2014 Golden Foot.

Iniesta fought off competition from other household names such as Wayne Rooney, Andrea Pirlo and Thierry Henry to become the first Spaniard to lift the award that can only be won by players aged 28 or over.

Attending a gala in Monaco on Monday evening with his wife Anna Ortiz, Iniesta joined previous winners Ronaldinho, Ryan Giggs and Zlatan Ibrahimovic by having a mould of his footprints taken on stage during the ceremony.

The Golden Foot award, which has been running for more than a decade, can only be won once and is determined by an online poll.

That comes after a panel of journalists select 10 finalists based on personality and achievements.

Iniesta's mould will join those of previous winners in the 'Champions promenade', based along Monaco's seafront.

The 30-year-old, who has been on the books at the Nou Camp since 1996, tweeted the ceremony: 'Thank you very much everyone for this award... Golden Foot 2014!'

Iniesta returns to Barcelona for training on Tuesday to continue  their La Liga campaign as they look to reclaim the title from reigning champions Atletico Madrid.

Rooney may not fret over the loss too much, however, as the England captain looks towards winning his 100th cap at Wembley next month.

All being well, Rooney will become England's youngest-ever centurion by nearly three years against Slovenia at the age of 29.

The Golden Foot is an award reserved for players aged 28 or over, and has been given out every year since 2003.

It involves an internet voting system after a panel of journalists select 10 finalists based on personality and achievements.

Once you win, a permanent mould of your feet are added to the 'Champions promenade' along Monaco's seafront.
