Richie McCaw has squeezed in a lot between his two trips to Caerphilly Castle, which stands seven miles north of Cardiff.

His first visit was in 1999, while he was on tour with New Zealand Under 19s, and his second was earlier this week when he took time out ahead of his 100th Test as captain of the All Blacks.

One World Cup, three International Player of the Year awards and a legacy as one of the greatest rugby players of all time sit at the top of his CV. Yet the iconic No 7 still strives to better himself, pointing out on Friday that there is room for improvement in the game against Wales on Saturday.

New Zealand have won three from three so far on their northern tour but that is not enough for McCaw, who wants to finish on a high in front of his parents after they made the 23-hour trip to witness his milestone at the Millennium Stadium. The 32-year-old has spent more than two years of his life on tour with the All Blacks, but 1999 still holds vivid memories.

‘It was my first real trip outside New Zealand,’ he said. ‘To go on tour with a New Zealand team was something I never dreamed of and to get the chance straight out of school was pretty cool. Tony Woodcock was in that team; it makes you feel a bit old!

‘A few of us had a look around Caerphilly Castle the other day, which we did back in ’99. That brought back a few memories of walking around with wide eyes. I never thought I’d be coming back 15 years later with all the things that happened in between.’

Wales was where McCaw first captained the All Blacks in 2004, but also the scene of his worst defeat, a controversial 20-18 loss to France in the 2007 World Cup quarter-final.

The ghosts of that upset, which sparked national uproar back home, were laid to rest in 2011, when New Zealand were crowned world champions in their own back yard, and head coach Steve Hansen puts that down to a change in mindset under their skipper.

‘In 2007 we had a team which should have won the World Cup but we stuffed it up because we expected to win it,’ said Hansen. ‘We had the players to do that but we didn’t have the mindset. You have got to go and earn the right to win it. I don’t think we were hungry enough.

‘When you expect something to happen you sit back and wait for it to happen, but when you are really hungry for something you go and take it. Mentally we have got stronger.’

They have created an unbreakable aura and that is what Wales must overcome on Saturday. Warren Gatland’s side have not beaten any of the Southern Hemisphere powerhouses since 2008 and their record against the Kiwis stands at 25 consecutive defeats — by an average margin of 24 points — since their last victory in 1953, more than 25 years before any of the current team were even born.

So when asked if a shock result on Saturday would top winning the Six Nations, it is little surprise that Dan Biggar’s answer was ‘absolutely’.

‘For us to win would be the best days in our rugby careers,’ said the Wales No 10. ‘It’s been a long time since we beat the All Blacks and we have it in us to do it. Hopefully we can create something special.

‘They may be the best rugby side ever. We will all have to come up with nine-out-of-10 or 10-out-of-10 performances to get a result. Anything below that from each of us is probably not going to be good enough. We have to turn up and push ourselves to demand excellence.’

That level of excellence is what McCaw demands in training every day. If Wales are going to deny the Kiwi a happy 100th, then they will have to defend the Millennium Stadium like Caerphilly Castle.
