It wasn't so much their skills on the ball, but the state of their ever-fraying club kit that has made them a Sunday league laughing stock.

Now one football team have decided to have some fun of their own by taking to the pitch in their pants in a desperate bid to secure a brand new strip.

Playford Football Club, who compete in the Flowsports Ipswich Sunday Football League, have produced a whacky video in the hope it will persuade a sponsor to come forward.

Naked ambition: Members of Playford Sunday league football club take to the pitch in their pants in a desperate bid to attract a sponsor to buy them a new kit

What a catch: The lads have produced a whacky video of them in action to the LMFAO's hit Sexy And I Know It

In the three-minute film, the Suffolk side hit the turf in just their underwear, shin pads and boots to the tune of LMFAO's hit Sexy And I Know It.

Within days of the clip appearing on YouTube, more than 500 people have viewed it.

They came up with the idea after their last kit became so tatty it had the opposition in fits of laughter.

Club captain Richard Jones, 27, said: 'It not always easy to find sponsorship these days so we wanted to do something that would make us stand out.

'Our relegation last year certainly wasn't going to do that so we came up with the idea of a video.It was good fun to make, if slightly odd, and hopefully people will enjoy watching it.'

Have it! The boys leave the 'changing room' in just their underwear, boots and shin pads to face the opposition

Getting the tackle in: The club, which competes in the Flowsports Ipswich Sunday Football League, was getting tired of opponents laughing at their tatty old kit

The loin toss: The team, which includes a delivery driver, a groundsman, IT expert and insurance workers, was relegated by two divisions after a dismal 2010/11 season that saw them concede more than 100 goals

Winger Stuart Goldsmith, 30, who features performing an elaborate stretching routine, said: 'New players might think twice about joining us if they see this video.

'But we're not particularly bothered about that at the moment. We just want to do everything we can to get some kit.

'I don't particularly fancy playing in next to nothing in November and December.'

The team, which includes a delivery driver, students, a groundsman, IT expert and insurance workers, was relegated by two divisions after a dismal 2010/11 season that saw them concede more than 100 goals.

But last season, they recovered to secure a third place finish in the fourth tier of the Ipswich league, securing promotion in the process.

The Woodbridge-based team, formed in 1998, also won the league fair play award.

Manager Chris Jones, 30, whose record is marred by a goal difference of minus 100 over his five years in charge, said: 'The main aim is to secure a sponsor, get a new kit and make sure we don't have to do anything like this again.'

Playford fan Laura Holland, 28, who occasionally brings dog Poppy to watch husband and star striker James, 35, said: 'The video did make laugh.

'They don't look particularly pretty but hopefully it will work.

'I don't think Suffolk is quite ready for this type of thing so let's hope they get some kit to cover up soon.'

The club is appealing for would-be sponsors to visit its website and is asking for a donation of around Â£1,000 to secure sponsorship to buy the kit.
