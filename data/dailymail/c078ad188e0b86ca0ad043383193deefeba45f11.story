Tis the season to be jolly, unless you've been a naughty child in Austria, where you will not only miss out on gifts from Saint Nicholas but will also be dragged off to a fiery underworld by a cloven-hoofed creature known as the Krampus.

This demon-like character is the evil companion of St Nic, but while the kindly saint gives out gifts to good children, the Krampus punishes the bad ones by beating them with chains and dragging them to Hell.

Part of Central European alpine folklore going back at least a millennium, since the 17th-century the creature has traditionally accompanied St.Nicholas and angels on December 5 as he makes his way through towns and villages.
