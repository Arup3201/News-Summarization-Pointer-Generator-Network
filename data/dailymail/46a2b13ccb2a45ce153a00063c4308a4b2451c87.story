Two more men have been found guilty of wearing burkas and posing as Muslim women to steal £1m of designer watches in a smash and grab attack raid at Selfridges. 

Ritchie Graham, 23, and Vincent Bellamy, 37, were found guilty of conspiracy to commit robbery at the Selfridges Wonder Room between 1 January 2013 and 7 June 2013.

Customers and staff at the famous store on London’s Oxford Street were left 'terrified' as a gang of men dressed in burkas smashed display cabinets in the shop's Wonder Room stealing 143 watches worth £1,496,280 and damaging others worth £1.1m last June.

But as they fled on stolen motorbikes, a motor scooter and a BMW car, the rider of the scooter Connor Groake lost control and both he and Sam Curtin, who was still wearing his burka, were tackled to the ground by passers-by. 

The gang, armed with axes and other equipment, had also worn burkas to raid a jewellery store in Windsor two months earlier.

During the 'well-planned robbery' at Robert Gatward jewellers in King Edward Court the gang smashed display cabinets stealing 19 Rolex watches costing between £3,000 and £31,650 each.

As they ran through the pedestrian zone, one of the burqa clad men wielded an axe raised above his head to 'ward off anyone who may have sought to impede their escape.'

The north London-based gang escaped by car with £175,000 of watches and caused a further £41,361 worth of damage.

Prosecutor Roger Smart earlier told Kingston Crown Court following the Windsor robbery, the same gang, along with some new faces, 'doubtless buoyed by the success of the robbery in Windsor' targeted Selfridges on Oxford Street in central London on June 6th last year.

He said: 'The plot to rob was audacious, well-planned and carried out with the same degree of professional execution as the previous robbery.

'They made their way inside the store and smashed at showcases containing high value watches of a variety of makes.

'Members of the public and staff were terrified by their actions. The robber used the burka to disguise their identities and hide their equipment.

'Such was their behaviour and appearance that it crossed the minds of many of those who were forced to witness the robbery that the men dressed in burka were using them in order to hide their identities while perpetrating a terrorist atrocity.'

But as they escaped the scooter rider lost control and Mr Smart said: 'It was the quick thinking and bravery of members of the public that lead to both of them being detained, some of the watches being recovered and aided the police investigation.'

Response: The court heard how getaway drivers crashed and were apprehended

Before the trial started Curtin, 20, and Groake, 25, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to rob Selfridges.Last July, Groake was sentenced to eight years and Curtin to 13 years in jail.

Curtin also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to rob the Windsor jewellery and has yet to be sentenced.

Kris Monaghan, 25, and Ian Rawlings, 31, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to rob Selfridges at an earlier hearing and also await sentence.
