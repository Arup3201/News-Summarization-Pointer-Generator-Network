Sante Kimes, who along with her son made up a notorious grifter team convicted of the murders of a wealthy widow in New York and a businessman in LA, has died in her prison cell aged 79.

Kimes, who was portrayed by Mary Tyler Moore in a TV movie, died on Monday night after being found unresponsive at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in Westchester County, said Linda Foglia, spokeswoman for the state Department of Corrections.

In 2000, Kimes and her son, Kenneth Kimes, were convicted of murder in connection with the disappearance of Irene Silverman, an 82-year-old widow and former Radio City Music Hall Rockette.

The Kimeses conspired to steal Silverman's $7million Manhattan town house and other possessions, and her body has never been found. Kimes planned to assume the identity of the 82-year-old multimillionaire.

At the time of the Kimeses' sentencing, authorities said Kenneth Kimes strangled Silverman and then he and his mother put her body in garbage bags and disposed of it somewhere only they knew.

A police search of their car and luggage found guns, a knockout liquid, plastic handcuffs, fright masks, syringes, tapes of Silverman's telephone conversations and a fake deed to Silverman's home.

Sante Kimes was sentenced to 120 years in prison and would not have been eligible for parole until 2119. Her son received 125 years.

They were convicted using evidence from Kimes' notebooks which laid out the crime in detail along with notes written by Silverman, who was extremely suspicious of the mother and son.

In 2004, Sante Kimes was convicted in California of murder in the 1998 death of businessman David Kazdin, whose body was found in a trash bin. She was later sentenced to life in prison.

Although the Kazdin murder happened first, the mother-and-son team were arrested in New York City and so were tried first for the Silverman murder. Evidence in their car built the case for Kazdin's murder.

Kenneth Kimes, who pleaded guilty in 2003, also was sentenced to life in prison. He said his mother planned Kazdin's killing and sent him to do the job.

He testified that he shot Kazdin in the back of the head at close range and that someone he found at a homeless shelter helped him dispose of the body.

He said his mother decided to kill Kazdin, an old friend, after Kazdin found out that she had taken out a $280,000 loan by forging his signature.

Kenneth confessed to murdering a third man, banker Sayed Bilal Ahmed, on his mother's orders in The Bahamas in 1996.

No charges were ever filed but Kenneth Kimes said that he and his mother drugged Ahmed and drowned him a bathtub before dumping his body in the sea. Santa Kimes denied any involvement.

Sante Kimes' criminal past also included a 1986 conviction for illegally transporting Mexican girls and keeping them as prisoners and household slaves in her Las Vegas home.

The made-for-TV movie about the Kimeses, Like Mother Like Son: The Strange Story of Sante and Kenny Kimes, featured Gabriel Olds as the son.

Kimes was born Sandra Louise Walker in Oklahoma City, according to court records.

Kent Walker, Kimes' estranged son said in
 his book Son Of A Grifter, that his mother was from a good family who 
were unable to cope with her wild ways.

In one of her wildly varying stories 
about her past, Kimes claimed that her father was a laborer and 
her mother a prostitute who left Oklahoma for LA, leaving her young daughter to fend for herself.

Kimes also committed insurance fraud and arson so she could collect on property damage. She was a skilled grifter - once even managing to gain access to a Ford administration reception 
at the White House by introducing her husband as an ambassador.

She 
loved to impersonate Elizabeth Taylor, to whom she had a passing 
resemblance.
