Chijindu Ujah was unable to strengthen his claims for a 100 metres spot at the European Championships as he could only manage 10.20 seconds for sixth place on his Diamond League debut in Paris on Saturday night.

The 20-year-old tops the British rankings after running 9.96s in Hengelo last month, but is battling it out with the fit-again James Dasaolu for the third and final spot on the team for August's Europeans in Zurich.

After missing out on automatic selection for the event by coming third at the British Championships last weekend - Dwain Chambers and Harry Aikines-Aryeetey booked their places by finishing first and second - Ujah had been hoping to respond to Dasaolu's 10.03s run in Lausanne on Thursday.

Disappointing: Ujah only managed to finish sixth on his Diamond League debut

But, after a long delay while the man a lane inside him, Jamaica's Nickel Ashmeade, complained in vain over his disqualification for a false start, Ujah, running in lane eight, never got into the race.

American Mike Rodgers took the victory in 10.00.

Dasaolu may now hold the edge in the fight for the third 100m spot in Zurich, given his outing in Lausanne was his first race of the season following a hamstring injury and his young rival has struggled to back up his Hengelo performance.

There was reason for British cheer at the Meeting Areva, though, as Laura Muir and Laura Weightman both ran personal bests in the 1500m.

Muir set a new Scottish record and became the fifth fastest Briton ever over the distance as she clocked 4.00.07 to finish sixth in a race won by Holland's Sifan Hassan in a world-leading 3:57.00.

Weightman was eighth in 4:00.17 to go sixth on the British all-time list.

Tough: Ujah might have given his rivals the edge when it comes to European Championships qualifying

Hansle Parchment clocked a Jamaican record and world-leading 12.94 in winning the 110m hurdles.

There were two more world leads from Kenyan athletes, with Asbel Kiprop winning the 800m in 1:43.34 and Edwin Soi the 5,000m in 12:59.82.

Shara Proctor was fourth in the long jump with 6.70m and Tiffany Porter fifth in the 100m hurdles in 12.72.

Niall Flannery, the European number one, could only manage seventh in the 400m hurdles in 49.73, while Eilish McColgan was 13th in the 3,000m steeplechase.

Meanwhile, in Mannheim at the Bauhaus Junior Gala, there was further evidence of Britain's exciting sprint talent.

Adam Gemili, who wants to focus on the 200m at the Europeans, set a new 100m personal best of 10.04, timely less than three weeks out from the Commonwealth Games, while 18-year-old Dina Asher-Smith clocked a marginally windy 11.03 in the women's 100m.
