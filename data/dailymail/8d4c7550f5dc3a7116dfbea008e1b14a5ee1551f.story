They are known as man's best friend and to John Stortz, his dog is also the ultimate travel companion.

The illustrator loves nothing more than exploring the US with his trusty dog Wolf in tow and has spent years hiking in mountains, canyons and across deserts with his pet.

The white husky dog even takes the starring role in Stortz's photos, often posing looking out across America's most spectacular landscapes.

The artist adopted the dog - full name Wolfgang - from a shelter and has spent the past two years travelling with him around the US. 

The illustrator, who sells his photos and prints of his illustrations, defines himself as having 'steady hands, wandering feet'.

He has photographed his four-legged companion in some of the most beautiful places in America, from Angeles National Forest to the ghost towns of Nevada.

Stortz keeps track of his travels on his Instagram page, with his dog pictures earning him more than 38,000 followers, and even sells prints on his tumblr blog.
