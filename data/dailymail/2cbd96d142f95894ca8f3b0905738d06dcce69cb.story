Daker was convicted on Friday of 11 counts of felony murder, burglary, false imprisonment, aggravated assault, aggravated battery and attempted aggravated stalking, for the strangling death of Karmen Smith and the stabbing of Miss Smith's son, Nick, in 1995.

Mrs Blatz and Mr Smith are determined to move past the tragedy that has haunted them for more than two decades, as she proudly proclaimed 'He has no power over me.'

'He didn't break me,' an emotional Mr Smith told 20/20.

Daker was convicted of stabbing Mr Smith 18 times when he was just five years old.

'I just feel a little more free than I did before,' he added.

Both Mrs Blatz and Mr Smith had to face Daker in court, as the criminal served as his own attorney, cross-examining his victims.

Mrs Blatz said she didn't want to face him for the trial, but Mr Smith's courage inspired her.

'I just kept on thinking, that poor Nick has got to confront the man that stabbed him eighteen times, and murdered his mom,' she said.

'And if he’s going to do it, I gotta be strong for him, to show him that we can do it.'

Mrs Blatz said she struggled to come to terms with what transpired that tragic day.

'This is clearly something that I've held in for so long that only a few close, dear friends are aware of what I experienced at the hands of Waseem Daker,' she said, weeping.

During the trial, both Mr Smith and Mrs Blatz gave emotional testimony when questioned by Daker.

At one point, Daker said Mrs Blatz's statements were inappropriate, to which she responded: 'It’s really inappropriate that you stalk me and harass me, and you’re sitting here asking me questions, and I have to come back with you and answer your questions, that’s hard for me!'

Mr Smith responded similarly when Daker confronted him about statements he made from his hospital bed after the attack, when he told police his mother's killer's eyes were blue.

'I was in the hospital and had gotten stabbed repeatedly by you, so I don’t really think that that was a very good time to be asking a 5-year-old questions like that,' he said, looking Daker in the eye.

The jury near Atlanta began 
deliberating the decision shortly before 10 a.m. Friday and returned a 
guilty verdict against Waseem Daker in less than five hours. 

The
35-year-old was indicted on 11 counts, including malice and felony 
murder, burglary, false imprisonment, aggravated assault, aggravated 
battery and attempted aggravated stalking.

Convicted: Daker served as his own attorney during his trial

Daker is charged in the October 23, 1995 killing of Karmen Smith in her Cobb County home.

Daker killed Miss Smith and attacked her son because he was obsessed with Lottie Spencer Blatz, who lived upstairs from them, prosecutors said. Daker was convicted of stalking Mrs Blatz in 1996. 

Authorities had long suspected Daker but couldn't connect him to the slaying until new DNA testing linked him to Miss Smith's death in 2009.

Daker did not react as the verdict against him was read, The Marietta Daily Journal reported.

But several of Miss Smith's relatives and friends showed relief, including Mrs Blatz and Nick Smith, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Both Mrs Blatz and Mr Smith had testified against Daker.

Jurors asked the judge during deliberations for permission to replay a portion of taped telephone conversations that allegedly occurred between Daker and Mrs Blatz on October 13 and 14, about a week before the slaying, and a portion of a taped interview Daker had with Cobb County Police Detective Brad McIntyre after the slaying.

Daker objected to the jury hearing only portions of the tapes, and wanted them to hear the whole thing, but Superior Court Judge Mary Staley overruled the objection.
