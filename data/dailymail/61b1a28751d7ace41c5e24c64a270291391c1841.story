Manchester City’s new £6million goalkeeper Willy Caballero has warned Joe Hart that he has not joined the Premier League champions just to sit on the bench.

Caballero, 32, accepts that he will start the season as No 2 to the England international after agreeing to move from Malaga and play for his old boss Manuel Pellegrini.

But it is understood that Pellegrini wants Caballero to fight Hart for a first-team place and the Argentine is up for the challenge.

‘I’ve come to play,’ said Caballero, who started City’s first two pre-season tour games in Hart’s absence. ‘I know the situation because Joe is a fantastic goalkeeper but I will fight to play.

‘The decision will be down to the coach, the boss. I have trained well in the last three or four weeks and I need more time with my teammates, but I will be ready for the beginning of the season.

‘Goalkeepers are a different type of player and I believe in myself. City are a big club and it’s a big opportunity. I want to try in every way I can to play.’

Although Hart is set to be offered a new contract, Pellegrini wants Caballero to provide more competition than Costel Pantilimon who had to be satisfied with playing in the domestic cups apart from a seven-game run in the Premier League when Hart was axed at the end of last year.

Speaking during a visit to a local youth training camp in the shadow of Yankee Stadium where City face Liverpool in the early hours of Thursday morning, Caballero added: ‘I don’t know if I will play in the cup or other tournaments, I only know that he wanted me.

‘I came here for the best opportunity for my career, for my life and for my family. It’s fantastic for me.’

Caballero has become the fifth Argentine on City’s books, joining Sergio Aguero, Pablo Zabaleta and his former Malaga teammate Martin Demichelis – who have yet to join up with the City squad after appearing in the World Cup final – as well as other new signing Bruno Zuculini.

Earlier in his career he found himself stuck behind first-choice Roberto Abbondanzieri at Boca Juniors for three years and left Argentina to pursue first-team football in Spain, first with Elche and then Malaga where he helped Pellegrini’s side reach the Champions League quarter-finals last year. He also set a new club record in 2011 by not conceding a goal for 480 minutes.

‘I’m used to this, I’ve done it before,’ said Caballero, who won the title at Boca and the FIFA Under 20 World Cup with Argentina in 2001. ‘When I was younger I was in the same situation with the No.1 goalkeeper at Boca Juniors. He was in the best time of his career and it was very difficult for me to challenge him. The solution then was for me was to leave and go and play in Spain.

‘The other Argentine players arrive in five days’ time and I’m looking forward to seeing them. I know Martin Demichelis very well, and I’m looking forward to working with Pablo Zabaleta and Sergio Aguero.’

Caballero admits that the opportunity to team up with Pellegrini again was a major factor in his decision to leave Spain and move to the Premier League.

‘Manuel was a very important figure in me coming to Manchester City. Knowing him from before and having played for him was crucial. He’s the same. It’ the same pre-season, the same work, and he treats people exactly the same.

‘English football is very different from Spain but it’s the same for the strikers and defenders as well. I know the coach, I know the way to work and in the next four weeks I will get used to it.’
