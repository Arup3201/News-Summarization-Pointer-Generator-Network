Her turn as a cold character in Four Weddings And A Funeral and a villain in Only God Forgives made her a household name - and one of the world's most in-demand actresses.

But, at 54, Kristin Scott Thomas says she's fed up of playing these 'cold' characters and is now swapping the cinema for the stage.

Speaking to the Radio Times, the acclaimed actress said: 'I got fed up with being asked to do the same thing, playing cold, wicked bitches'.

The mother-of-three added: 'I felt like the camera was stealing bits of me and the end product was a mosaic, just snippets. If I cried on film, they weren't my tears.'

The British-French actress is now vowing to make theatre her priority and she's kicking things off in May by portraying the Queen in The Audience. 

She takes over the reins from Dame Helen Mirren in Peter Morgan's show, which tells the tale of the royal's weekly meetings with various prime ministers.

Indeed, Kristin and Helen now have more in common than just a shared role; Kristin was  named a Dame in the New Year's Honours List, alongside Joan Collins and Sheridan Smith.

One of her most celebrated roles was in Four Weddings and a Funeral alongside Simon Callow, Charlotte Coleman, John Hannah and Hugh Grant

In the past, the star has said that she considers herself to be more French than English after moving to Paris to become an actress at the age of 19 and bringing up her three children there. 

The actress is nonetheless diverting her attention back to her British roots for the foreseeable future after announcing that she had quit films in 2014 and taking on a string of West End roles.

Speaking to The Guardian about her latest career move last year, she said: 'I just suddenly thought, I cannot cope with another film.

'I realised I've done the things I know how to do so many times in different languages, and I just suddenly thought, I can't do it any more. I'm bored by it. So I'm stopping.'

At 54, the brunette discussed her place in the industry and the brick wall she's facing as a 'woman in her fifties.'

'I'm sort of, as the French would say, "stuck between two chairs",' she continued. 'Because I'm no longer 40 and sort of a seductress, and I'm not yet a granny.'
