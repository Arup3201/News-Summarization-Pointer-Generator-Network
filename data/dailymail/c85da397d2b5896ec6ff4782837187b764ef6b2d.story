Cinderella, I am delighted to say, has made it to the ball.

Just six weeks ago, New Britannic looked a dilapidated sight on her Kentish mooring.   Few passers-by would have noticed the little brass plate commemorating her heroic part in the greatest rescue operation in British history – Dunkirk.

In that sorry state, she was never going to make it to the greatest maritime party in several centuries – Sunday’s Diamond Jubilee Pageant on the Thames.

She's arrived: The 'Little Ship' New Britannic, which saved 3000
lives in the Dunkirk evacuation arrives in London to join the 1,000 
crafts taking part in the Jubilee pageant

Ahoy there: The New Britannic's crew waves to the shore as she sets sail ready to join the Royal Flotilla

But thanks to the generosity of Daily Mail readers, she is seaworthy again. Better still, she has made it to London for the first time in her 82-year existence.

Yesterday, to whoops of delight from her devoted skipper and crew, she came chugging under Tower Bridge and on past some of the capital’s most famous landmarks.

And, come Sunday, she will be part of the 50-strong Dunkirk contingent enjoying pride of place behind the Queen in that historic fleet of 1,000 craft.

There is a real buzz building on the 
banks of the Thames where this friendliest of armadas has started 
arriving from all over the world.

Many of East London’s docks have been turned into temporary accommodation for the smaller craft.

Yesterday, beneath the shiny 
skyscrapers of Canary Wharf, I found a fleet of historic boats moored 
up, including several Dunkirk Little Ships.

Most
are in excellent condition but I still saw many owners in boiler suits,
crawling over their engines just to make sure that nothing goes wrong 
cometh their greatest moment since 1940.

Proud history: The New Britannic makes her way under Tower Bridge for the first time in her 82-year existence

Plucky: Dwarfed in between a Royal Navy vessel and the French 19th century barque Belem the New Britannic continues her journey up the Thames

One of these boats, Janthea, made two
round trips to the carnage of Dunkirk, bringing back a cargo of British
troops on the first run and French troops on the second.

Her pageant crew will include Peter Lough, 72, who was a schoolboy chorister at the Queen’s Coronation in 1953.

‘It’s all going to be stunning. No 
one does this sort of thing better,’ he said yesterday, proudly 
producing the Coronation Medal he was awarded for his boyhood service to
the Crown.

Last night, New Britannic was the latest arrival to this makeshift village in West India Docks.

Her
owner and skipper, Australian engineer Greg McLeish, was at pains to 
point out that his boat would never have got to London had Daily Mail 
readers not heard of her plight last month and responded in their 
droves.

‘I want to thank every one of them,’ he said.

Pride of place: The 54ft craft had never ventured much beyond the Kent coast around Ramsgate when she was summoned to Dunkirk in May 1940

The 54ft New Britannic had never ventured much beyond the Kent coast around Ramsgate when she was summoned to Dunkirk in May 1940.

Her owner, Walter Read, sailed to France with his  15-year-old son, Joe, who is believed to have been the youngest participant in the great evacuation.

That one small boat is believed to have plucked 3,000 men from the beaches and delivered them safely to waiting warships.

Neither Walter nor Joe ever spoke much about their experience afterwards and both men have since passed away.

But, yesterday, Joe’s nephew, Tony Read, 61, was on board for the 12-hour voyage to London. What did it mean to see New Britannic prepare to take her place in front of the Queen?

‘It brings a tear to the eye,’ he said. Come Sunday afternoon, he won’t be the only one.

Heyday: The New Britannic is believed to have plucked 3,000 men from the beaches and delivered them safely to waiting warships.
