The first Alpine stage of the Tour de France ended the hopes of Richie Porte, the Team Sky leader, as he conceded more than eight minutes on the 13th stage on Friday and slipped from second to 16th overall.

The Australian arrived at the summit of Chamrousse with Geraint Thomas - who fell to 18th overall - on a day that Sky principal Sir Dave Brailsford admitted he ‘didn’t see coming’.

As Vincenzo Nibali romped away for his third stage win to tighten his grip on the race leader’s yellow jersey, Brailsford said: ‘That wasn’t the Richie Porte we saw in the first half of the race.

‘We’re not going to roll over,’ he added.

‘It was a blow losing Chris (Froome, to a crash on stage five) and, seeing how Nibali’s going, it would have been an interesting race.

'We recalibrated then and now we’ve got to recalibrate again. I think we can look to animate the race as much as we can.’

Porte, who lost contact on the lower slopes of the monster 18km climb to the ski station at Chamrousse, said: ‘It’s a massive shame. I feel more for my team-mates, who have been brilliant.

‘But if it happens to me it can happen to other guys, so we’ll keep pushing.’
