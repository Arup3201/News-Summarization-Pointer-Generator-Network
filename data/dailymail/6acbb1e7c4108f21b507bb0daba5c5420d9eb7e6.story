They may have spent all their lives in a zoo pen, but two young cheetahs at the Smithsonian National Zoo knew just what to do when a wild deer jumped into their enclosure Friday: kill it.

The deer was discovered shortly before noon by a zookeeper who heard noises coming from the pen and found the carcass next to cheetah siblings Carmelita and Justin.

A spokesman for the Washington, DC zoo called the attack 'a normal and expected reaction'.

Doctors will examine the deer carcass to make sure it didn't have any diseases.

No one saw the deer enter the cheetah habitat, the zoo said, though there is a live camera in the pen for anyone to stream online.

MailOnline reached out to the zoo for comment on Monday, but calls were not immediately returned.

Deer have been a problem at the adjacent Rock Creek Park, where the National Park Service has enlisted sharpshooters to control the population.

A similar incident happened at that zoo in 2009 when a deer jumped a zoo wall and was killed by two lions.

Justin and Carmelita have been at the zoo for a little more than a year and a half.

The
 two were born through a risky cesarean section in April 2012 that ended
 up saving both the cubs' and mother's lives. The cubs were treated for 
several days in intensive care after their birth.

Three months later, the cheetah cubs made their debut at the zoo but had yet to be named.

The
 zoo partnered with USA Track & Field in the days leading up to the 
2012 Olympic Games and decided to name the brother and sister after the 
two American runners who placed highest in the 100-meter dash.

Justin Gatlin took home the bronze medal in the the race, and Carmelita Jeter won the silver medal.
