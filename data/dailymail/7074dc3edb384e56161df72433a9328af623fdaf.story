The 'no makeup selfies' which have taken the internet by storm over the last two days are thought to have raised a staggering £2 million for charity.

But while charities such as Breakthrough Breast Cancer and Cancer Research are delighted, some critics have slammed the campaign for making light of the deadly disease.

On this morning's Today programme on Radio 4, student and blogger Yomi Adegoke, 22, said that while it was 'fantastic' that so much money had been raised, the campaign was flawed.

Amy Willerton, left, and Yomi Adegoke, right, appeared on Radio 4's Today programme. Miss Willerton said it was a 'great way to promote awareness.' Miss Adeogoke said that while all the money raised was 'fantastic,' deeming barefaced selfies as courageous was wrong

'I didn't agree with the campaign's original format, which was simply people writing, "no makeup selfie" without including donations or link to charities,' said Miss Adeogoke on the news and current affairs programme.

'I do think that in its current state, raising so much money, its been fantastic.

'But if women not wearing makeup is deemed as brave when held against cancer, it does say quite a bit about society today.

'I know the campaign was to normalise women not wearing makeup, but to suggest that by doing so is being exposing and leaving somebody vulnerable, that is problematic.'

Anyone using social media over the last 48 hours can't fail to have noticed a flurry of snaps featuring women with no slap on.

In fact the trend has taken Twitter and 
Facebook by storm with thousands of females wiping off their makeup and
 posting photos using the hash tag #NoMakeUpSelfie.

Also speaking on the Today programme was model Amy Willerton, 21, who posted a barefaced selfie of herself in the bath.

'I didn't think twice about posting one of these pictures,' she told the programme.

'I just thought, "Wow, what a great way to promote cancer awareness."

'I took a selfie in the bath, posted it online and it got a lot of attention which is good.

'I don't feel I was particularly courageous doing it, but it's a good message to send out there.

'Women are exposing themselves and showing that more vulnerable side in the same way that we're all vulnerable to cancer.'

Miss Adegoke, a law student at Warwick University, argued that promoting the act of not wearing makeup as courageous, was worrying.

'I
 think that, in 2014, if its considered that ground-breaking that women 
aren't wearing makeup, I don't really understand why,' she said.

'It's like you shave your head for cancer 
or get in a tub of baked beans for cancer, you do something that's out of the 
ordinary.'

Everyone from cancer survivors to men in full drag have been posting pictures in on Twitter and Facebook.

Though nobody seems to know where the idea came from, the rule seemed to be that women post their picture and then nominate other female friends to do the same with all posting that the photos were to 'raise awareness of cancer'.

After becoming aware of the flurry of selfies, Cancer Research sent out a tweet saying: 'We’re loving your #cancerawareness #nomakeupselfie pics! The campaign isn’t ours but every £ helps #beatcancersooner.'

Cancer Research says so far it has raised £2million.

Those posting the selfies or nominating others to do so are texting the word BEAT to 70099 TO DONATE £3.

Carolan Davidge, director of communications at Cancer Research UK said, 'The #nomakeupselfie Twitter trend isn’t something Cancer Research UK started – but it’s great to see so many people getting involved to help raise awareness of cancer amongst their friends and family.

Sisters Natalie Kirby, left and Joanne Kirby, far right, posed makeup free. Joanne's daughter Charlotte also put in her support.

'If people would like to choose to support our work to beat cancer sooner, they can visit www.cruk.org.'

It's not known where or how the trend for using a no makeup selfie started this time around although last week author Laura Lippman caused an online storm with a similar campaign in support of actress Kim Novak and her appearance at the Oscars.

Now, following this new viral selfie campaign the Facebook group No Make Up Selfie For Cancer Awareness has more than 153,690 likes and hundreds of photo uploads.

Cancer
 survivor Deborah Ferguson from Liverpool submitted her photo to the 
Facebook group and agreed to have it published on MailOnline.

She
 said: 'Can I campaign on behalf of all neglected boobies please? Give 
them a check,  I did that's why I have such a big smile as am a survivor.'

Another participant., Abigail Spillman said: 'I think it is a fantastic way to raise awareness. Its only been going on since yesterday and already it is trending worldwide.

'Along with a #nomakeupselfie and a small donation (if you wish) is a massive help. Well done on using Facebook and Twitter for putting it to good use!'

Sophie Williams, who works for a PR firm, told MailOnline she posted her #nomakeupselfie and promises to donate 50p for each like she receives to Cancer Research UK.

Dancer Felixy Splits posted a fresh 
faced pic, and told MailOnline: 'Everyone knows someone who has suffered
 from this awful disease.

'It's not only important to raise awareness but to donate anything you can. Make a difference and do something positive today.'

Katie Weirwas nominated by her friend and by doing so she donated £5 to the charity

Katie Weir of Freya Lingerie also joined in.

She told MailOnline: 'Through the recent nomination trend on Facebook it is easy to see the power of social media and how quickly posts can go viral.

'It is fantastic to see young women embracing their makeup free faces to raise awareness of breast cancer.

'I was nominated by my friend and by doing so I donated £5 to the charity which I wouldn't have done if I hadn't seen the status!'

Social media users have taken the internet by storm posting no-makeup selfies

And now the Fellas of Facebook and 
Twitter have decided they too want to get their mugs in on the action 
and a flurry of selfies featuring men in makeup have started appearing 
online.

Rachel Horkan submitted a photo of her 12-year-old little brother Zach in full makeup.

She
 wrote: '[He] decided to put the makeup on as us girls are taking it of 
all to help cancer awareness, so proud of him to do this at such a young
 age! Bless him lots of likes for this young man people xxx'

Martin Helliwell, 29, from Lancashire, piled on the slap to raise 
awareness.

Some of the fellas seem to have gone girly and cute, while others were maybe inspired by Halloween outfits when they got out the slap, but their efforts were all commendable.

Meanwhile the #NoMakeUpSelfie shows no signs of dieing down just yet as women continue to strip back their look in the name of charity.

Kath Abrahams, Director of Engagement and Income generation at Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: 'We are delighted to 
see the success of the no makeup selfie viral campaign. It is great to 
see the British public getting behind the campaign and helping to raise 
awareness of breast cancer.

John-Hunter went the whole way with make-up, wig and dress

'Here
 at Breakthrough, we have seen a huge spike in the number of unique 
visitors to our website, smashing our record to date. We have received 
hundreds of donations from people simply texting PINK to 70300 in the 
past 24 hours. We would like to thank all those who have supported us, 
enabling our scientists to continue their life-saving research.

'Breast
 cancer is not yesterday’s problem; every ten minutes a woman is 
diagnosed with breast cancer. Anything that gets the public behind this 
important cause is to be celebrated. It isn’t too late to get involved, 
so go ahead and text PINK to 70300.'

Wayne Mcgregor looks, erm, pretty in pink and a splash of lilac.

Nathan Reynolds was on trend with a strong brow. He definitely didn't obey the natural lip rule for spring though.

It has undoubtedly divided opinion, with some saying no makeup selfies are pointless
