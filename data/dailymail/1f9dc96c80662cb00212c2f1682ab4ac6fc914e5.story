These are the property hotspots where you can buy a house and supposedly still have enough money left over each month to have a life. 

When looking at the average salary after tax and average mortgage repayments across the country, Canberra has topped the list with homeowners having $3,271 leftover each month.

Sydneysiders are the worst off, according to calculations by comparison site Mozo.com.au.

'The emerald city is suffering the most, with the average mortgage repayment now taking a whopping 63 per cent of the average after tax salary, leaving Sydneysiders with less than $2,000 each month to cover everything else,' Mozo director Kirsty Lamont said.

'Meanwhile, Canberrans are parting with 42 per cent of their salary, leaving the rest for expenses and lifestyle such as dining out, travel or saving for a rainy day.'

Canberra’s high average salary of about $5,061, combined with an average property of about $510,000 means resident are left with more cash to spare than any other city. 

It is closely followed by Perth and then Hobart with homeowners having roughly $3,000 leftover each month.

Hobart (pictured) has the lowest average income nationwide and it has the lowest property prices

Homeowners in Brisbane have roughly $2,835 leftover each month for expenses and lifestyle such as dining out, travel or saving for a rainy day

Perth has the nation's second highest income to help cover the mortgage, but Hobart has the lowest average income nationwide and it has low property prices.

'If you look at the proportion of salary going towards a mortgage, Hobart (36 percent), Adelaide (41 percent) and Canberra (42 percent) are the three cities having to put the lest of their income towards repayments,' Ms Lamont said. 

Sydney and Melbourne are not only slapped with high repayments, they’re also among the world’s top 10 most expensive cities. 

The average monthly salary for someone living in Adelaide is $4,641, while mortgage repayments are $1,914

The average house price in Darwin is $530,000 and monthly mortgage repayments are around $2,474

Sydney and Melbourne (pictured) are not only slapped with high repayments, they’re also among the world’s top 10 most expensive cities

They have $1,895 and $2,387 left over each month respectively. 

'Big property prices mean big mortgages,' Ms Lamont said.

'Not usually known as the capital of fun, it looks like Canberra is where it’s at if you want to splash your extra cash and not be a slave to your mortgage.'
