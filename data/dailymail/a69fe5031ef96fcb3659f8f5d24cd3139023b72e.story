Your phone's 'lock' screen could be turned into an inescapable advert which pops up every time you switch your phone on

Your phone's 'lock' screen could be turned into an inescapable advert which pops up every time you switch your phone on.

That's the idea behind a new app, Lockscreen Lockview, which is to launch shortly on Android.

The adverts wouldn't be simple poster adverts - the whole screen would be 'branded' with the logos and 'look' of companies, and deliver information to users.

The new apps will be created in partnership with Conduit, an online advertising company.

'This is real prime real estate,' said Ori Lavie, VP of Conduit's mobile strategy.

'The brand gets much higher exposure, which drives more traffic to their app or Web site.'

The 'branded' apps are likely to be created in partnership with companies that offer constant information updates, such as sports results or stock prices, so that users have an incentive to use the app.

At present, a test version of Lockscreen Lockview is available free via Google's Play marketplace, unbranded, offering a 'custom' lock screen where users can navigate directly to the last app they used or to the photo application, for instance.

This test version will not be developed into a finished product, and instead Conduit will create 'branded' versions in collaboration with other companies.

The current free app will not be developed into a finished product - instead, Conduit will unveil new versions in partnership with companies that deliver information such as sports scores and stock prices

Conduit said that it would not permit companies to create apps that were simply adverts - the 'lock' would have to offers some function.
