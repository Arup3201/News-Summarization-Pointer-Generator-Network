Mark Zuckerberg has lost nearly half of his £11bn fortune after the disastrous Facebook stock market floatation.

The founder of the social network has seen £4.9bn vanish from his personal worth over the last 12 months.

Forbes magazine, which compiled figures of America’s richest billionaires, said that he had endured a ‘rough road’ since Facebook went public in May.

Disastrous floatation: The founder of the Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, has seen £4.9bn vanish from his personal worth over the last 12 months

The stock market price fell by nearly half to just £12 a share amid a flurry of lawsuits, finger-pointing and recriminations that will linger for years to come.

According to the Forbes list of Richest Americans for 2012, Zuckerberg has lost more money than anybody else, sending him down from 14th to 36th place.

In a sign of how volatile Facebook has become, last year he was the biggest gainer on the list having added £6.5bn to his fortune.

In its analysis Forbes says that Facebook has ‘performed poorly’ and that it reported a net loss of £96m in July, which drove the stock price down even more.

However it said that his personal fortune was still ‘impressive’ and that he remained committed to the company.

Forbes said: ‘The drop isn’t likely to change the hoodie-wearing CEO’s lifestyle much.

‘What’s less clear: whether the young executive, who married his longtime girlfriend Priscilla Chan the day after the (floatation) and headed off for an Italian honeymoon, can right the ship and make Facebook into a winning public company.’

Zuckerberg recently gave his first comments since Facebook went public and admitted it had wasted two years by not focusing on mobile devices.

His speech sparked a mini rally in the company’s stock price although he has already cashed out some of his wealth by offloading £697million of his own shares.

Facebook’s floatation has been dubbed the worst such event in modern history after a perfect storm of technical glitches and overpricing the stock rendered it a failure.

Zuckerberg, 27, has been personally sued for £1.8billion for allegedly deceiving smaller shareholders by not telling them about his private concerns.

Meanwhile institutional investors were informed, giving them a chance to get out fast.
