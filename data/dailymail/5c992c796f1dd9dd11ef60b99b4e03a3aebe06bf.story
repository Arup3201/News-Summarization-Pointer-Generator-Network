A gay couple claim they were chucked out of a taxi operated by Uber because they were kissing and cuddling. 

Jordan Sloat said the driver told them he usually took gay couples but 'they don't usually do that sort of thing' after he ordered them out of the taxi in London.

Mr Sloat and his partner Corey Watts, 23, had been in the car just minutes when the driver pulled over in Covent Garden and told them to get out at about 8pm on New Year's Day.

'I felt shocked - you don't expect that sort of homophobic reaction in London,' Mr Sloat told ITV News. 

The couple, who had been on their way to a friend's house, were forced to get another taxi. 

Uber confirmed the driver had been suspended since the incident and they were investigating. 

Mr Sloat added: 'We were kissing and cuddled next to each other when a minute or two after picking us up he pulled over and told us to get out. 

He said he was shocked by the reaction and asked the driver if it was because they were gay. He allegedly told them he picked up gay couples all the time but they 'don't normally do this.' 

Mr Sloat, who comes from Toronto, said he was shocked to witness this kind of behaviour in London and said his partner became angry - accusing the driver of 'disgusting homophobia.'  

They claim they asked the driver, who has now been suspended by Uber, if they were being asked to leave because they were gay and he said he did take gay couples but 'they didn't usually do that sort of thing' 

After the incident Mr Watts, a hair stylist from Cardiff, wrote on Twitter: 'Just got asked to get out of an @Uber cab for kissing my boyfriend. Flipped my s***.' 

The couple were initially charged for the journey but this was later refunded. 

Uber runs a taxi service in cities across the world and allows people to use an app to get a quote for a journey and order a car through their smartphones. 

Mr Watts posted a message on Twitter after the incident and said it has provoked unexpected reaction 

In a statement Uber said: 'Uber does not tolerate any form of discrimination either by our partner drivers or towards our partner drivers. 

'We opened an investigation from the moment we learned of this unacceptable incident and have been in contact with the rider to extended our sincere apologies and get further information. 

'The driver concerned has been suspended from the Uber platform.' 

Mr Watts accused the taxi firm of homophobia after they were ordered out of the taxi in Covent Garden 

In November the taxi firm was criticised after a driver refused to pick up a blind woman in Conneticut, apparently because she was with her guide dog. 

In London the launch of the firm has led to gridlocks after black cab drivers staged a 'go slow' protest because they claimed Uber was putting them out of business. 

It has already been banned in New Delhi after a driver allegedly raped a customer, and in Madrid because of claims that drivers carry out activities which constitute unfair competition.  

Uber was launched in 2009 in California. 

It operates through a smartphone app which allows customers to get a quote for a journey and order a car. 

The app works by locating the nearest suitable vehicle for the ride using GPS. 

Customers are then charged for the journey through their mobile phone bills and can even split the cost with friends. 

It is also possible to track the journey on mobile phones.  

When a journey is complete customers can rate the driver out of five stars. 

In December the company was valued at £25.5billion ($40 billion). 

The firm currently operates in 70 cities of 35 countries across the world.  

Uber has been banned in New Delhi after a driver allegedly raped a customer. 

Spain has also banned use of the app over claims drivers use unfair competition.
