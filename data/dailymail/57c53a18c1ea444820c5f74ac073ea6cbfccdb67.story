Two Red Noses have been launched into space in a race to see which would make it back to Earth first to raise money for Comic Relief.

BBC Radio Scotland's MacAulay and his team pitted their Red Nose against another backed by the pupils at Rimbleton Primary School in Glenrothes.

The two teams both launched their Red Noses into space in a race to see which would make it to 100,000ft above the Earth and back again in the quickest time.

The Great Comic Relief Space Race: Two Red Noses have been launched into space in a race to see which can make it back to Earth first

Boldly going where no Red Nose has gone before: A team at Strathclyde University helped to launch the two Red Noses into space

Dr Malcolm MacDonald, his team at Strathclyde University and Bruce Davies helped the two teams make the launch for the Great Comic Relief Space Race and captured images of Earth from over 100,000ft.

The Noses - Red Armstrong and Mac - were launched using helium balloons on Monday. The first balloon landed back on earth later the same afternoon bringing with it images of the Earth from Space. The second was found in Galloway Forrest Park on Thursday.

Fred MacAulay said, 'I am so proud to have been involved in this remarkable challenge. It's taken four long weeks of planning and we are all thrilled to have successfully launched the first Red Nose in space.

'Comic Relief spends the money raised from Red Nose Day to help change the lives of poor, vulnerable and disadvantaged people across the UK and Africa. It's a great cause and we've had great fun raising money and (literally) pushing boundaries.'

Comic Relief was launched on Christmas Day in 1985. Red Nose Day was later launched and the first ever event in 1988 raised £15million.

Over the last 25 years the event has raised £600million.

Organisers hope to add to that today by getting volunteers around the UK to do something funny to help raise money.

All for a good cause: The space race event - which ended on Thursday - came ahead of the traditional Comic Relief TV programme being broadcast on BBC 1 this evening

Chart star Jessie J will shave her head on live TV, while Miranda Hart, Dawn French, James Corden, David Walliams and Hollywood star Will Ferrell will appear in sketches or in person during tonight's Red Nose Day broadcast on BBC1 and BBC2.

During the evening, Hart will round off her week of live TV challenges, Miranda's Mad March, in addition to starring in a special edition of Call the Midwife, alongside Jessica Raine, Pam Ferris and Jenny Agutter.

Popular sitcom The Vicar of Dibley will return to TV for the first time in seven years with a one-off sketch, created by Comic Relief boss Richard Curtis.

Corden will be reviving his role as Smithy from Gavin And Stacey and Ferrell is to return to his character Ron Burgundy from hit movie Anchorman.

Even X Factor chief Simon Cowell will be showing his lighter side by taking part in a spoof in which he is seen to walk down the aisle in a wedding sketch, alongside David Walliams dressed as a blushing bride.

In addition, there will be hundreds of smaller events around the country encouraging people to give to projects in the UK and Africa, including a special nationwide Bake Off challenge.

The Comic Relief - Funny For Money programme begins at 7pm on BBC1.
