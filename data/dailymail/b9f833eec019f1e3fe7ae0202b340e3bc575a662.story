On an afternoon when Chelsea enjoyed an absurd amount of possession and again collected another three points in what appears a monopolistic title race, it’d be easy to overlook one man.

He sits in front of John Terry and Gary Cahill with a sole purpose: to patrol the width of Stamford Bridge and not give an inch.

Nemanja Matic performs this role so effectively that Jose Mourinho needn’t worry about teams travelling to west London in pursuit of catching the Blues cold.

Yes, Charlie Austin brilliantly equalised here with the sort of improvised flick only a poacher knows how, but the way in which Chelsea set up means they won’t drop many points in front of their own fans. Not many at all.

Matic sits alongside Cesc Fabregas - who has now managed as many assists this campaign than Mesut Ozil registered in the entirety of last - and allows the Spaniard to flourish.

There had been question marks in August as to how the pair work together. Fabregas is the sort of central midfielder insistent on hunting down causes - lost or otherwise. Therein lay a problem. Matic was also tasked with going and affecting the game higher up the pitch and Mourinho’s side were, on occasion, left bare.

The manager spotted that quickly. The solution has been to afford Fabregas the chance to do his thing while Matic sits a little deeper.

He has flourished, again laying on for Oscar to score a sumptuous opener with the outside of his right foot against Queens Park Rangers. You’ll struggle to see a better goal up and down the country this weekend.

That’s thanks in no small part to the Serbian, who is the master of retaining possession but also with the quickness of thought to notice runners around him.

Graeme Souness said in a newspaper column last week that Matic is already better than Claude Makelele. That may be premature at this stage, but all the signs are that the 26-year-old come become just as important.

After all, every title-winning side needs one. To just highlight his intelligence, Matic made sure he fouled the breaking Charlie Austin on halfway as we crept into stoppage time at 2-1. QPR looked dangerous, but the destroyer hauled Austin down. A crucial break in play ensued and the resulting free-kick came to nothing.

There may be Fabregas, Eden Hazard, Diego Costa and Oscar ahead of him, but it’s the finer details to Matic’s game that may prove decisive in games much bigger than this.
