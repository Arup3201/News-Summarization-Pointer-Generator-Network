Former Barclays boss Bob Diamond today hit back at claims he misled MPs over the rate-rigging scandal that cost him his job.

A report by MPs ruled that the banker 
failed to act with ‘candour and frankness’ and gave ‘highly selective’ 
evidence over revelations that his bank conspired to fix interest rates.

The Treasury Select Committee delivered damning verdicts on Barclays, the Bank of England, the Financial Services Authority and the Serious Fraud Office, condemning the culture of deceit in the City and the failure of its regulators to act.

Former Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond gave evidence to a Treasury Select Committee in July and a new report accuses him of misleading Parliament over the Libor rate-rigging scandal

Mr Diamond resigned as Barclays chief executive last month after the bank was fined £290million for manipulating the interbank lending rate known as Libor, which affects millions of mortgages.

Today, Mr Diamond said he was disappointed and strongly disagreed with several of the committee's statements.

'In particular, I strongly challenge certain assertions about my testimony,' he said. 'I answered every question that was put to me to me truthfully, candidly and based on information available to me.I categorically refute any suggestion to the contrary.

'I take particular issue with the attacks on Barclays' culture and character. Barclays, one of the only major UK financial institutions that did not need a rescue from the UK Government, is a tremendous institution with an over 300-year tradition of supporting economic growth and the communities in which we live and work.

The Financial Services Authority was slammed by the select committee report, which says the FSA was two years behind its US counterparts in investigating the affair

'I am proud of what we accomplished over
the 16 years I was employed there and our prudent management of the 
institution helped avoid the fates that befell other UK banks in 2009.

'The picture being presented today of what Barclays stood for under my watch could not be further from the truth.'

Mr Diamond said that the behaviour of
a small group of traders was 'reprehensible and not in keeping with 
Barclays' high standards.'

He
added: 'Looking forward, it's clear that thoughtful analysis and 
regulation of issues affecting the banking industry are required and I 
have no doubt that Barclays is committed to being part of the solution.'

In an interim report on the scandal, 
MPs said Mr Diamond presided over a culture at the bank where there was 
‘something deeply wrong’. 

His
testimony to the Treasury Committee, in which the American claimed to 
be unaware of the wrongdoing until days before the fine was announced, 
has been described as unconvincing.

‘Select committees are entitled to expect candour and frankness from witnesses before them,’ the MPs’ report said.

‘Mr
Diamond’s evidence, at times highly selective, fell well short of the 
standard that Parliament expects, particularly from such an experienced 
and senior witness.’

The 
Treasury Committee said it was ‘shocking’ that the Libor corruption, 
which went on between 2005 and 2009, ‘flourished for so long’. 

Mr
Diamond said the scandal made him ‘physically sick’ – but the select 
committee has accused him and other senior managers of turning ‘a blind 
eye’.

It said: ‘This 
attempted manipulation of Libor should not be dismissed as being only 
the behaviour of a small group of rogue traders. Such behaviour would 
only be possible if the management of the bank turned a blind eye to the
culture of the trading floor.’

Mr Diamond was also accused of putting up a ‘smokescreen’ by drawing attention to a conversation he had with Paul Tucker, the deputy governor of the Bank of England, in October 2008.

Bank of England chief: Mervyn King

This appeared to give the impression that Mr Tucker had given the nod to Barclays to rig rates to allay fears over its financial health.

While Mr Tucker has escaped serious censure, Whitehall sources said the report dents both his and FSA boss Lord Turner’s hopes of succeeding Sir Mervyn King as the Bank’s next Governor. 

It is good news for former Cabinet Secretary Lord O’Donnell. He is favoured by Nick Clegg, who will have a say in the selection process. A senior government source said: ‘Gus O’Donnell will be singing in his bath.’

The MPS say the FSA was two years behind U.S. authorities in launching a formal investigation into the imbroglio.

And the report also accuses the Bank of England of ‘naivety’. 

‘The evidence suggests that the Bank of England was aware of the incentive for banks to behave dishonestly, yet did not think that dishonesty was occurring,’ it states. ‘Nor did it appear to have asked the FSA to check to see if such dishonesty was occurring.’

The committee has called for an urgent reform at the bank, accusing regulators of arbitrarily pushing Mr Diamond out of his job.

Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie said: 'Regulators should not decide the composition of boards in response to headlines... Such an informal approach as was taken in this case is open to abuse.'

A Barclays spokesman said: ‘While we don’t expect to agree with every finding in [the report], we recognise that change is required . . . That is why we have established an independent review of our business practices.’ 

The FSA said it has ‘put in place a number of reforms in recent years, including a tougher fines policy for enforcement cases and a completely new model of bank supervision’.
