A train derailed Monday afternoon and burst into flames after being hit by another train just outside the North Dakota town of Casselton - which authorities have now ordered to be fully evacuated.

As many as a dozen train cars carrying the highly flammable cargo jumped the tracks at around 2pm before the second train filled with oil barreled into them, causing multiple massive explosions.

The toxic plume of flames and smoke has led officials to have the entire town evacuated. Casselton is a suburban town about 25 miles west of Fargo and has a population of about 2,500 people.

Disaster: A trail carrying oil derailed Monday afternoon in North Dakota and was hit by another train also carrying oil

The first train that derailed was 
carrying soybeans, the train that struck it was carrying crude oil, Joseph Faust, a spokesperson for Burlington Northern Santa Fe - which operates both 
trains - told MailOnline.

The first train was traveling westbound away from Casselton, a western suburb of Fargo, when it jumped the tracks, Mr Faust explained. The second eastbound train plowed into it a short time later, resulting in an explosion and fire, but that was only the beginning.

There were at least two more explosions, sending a mushroom cloud of bright orange flames hundreds of feet into the air, according to eyewitness accounts.

About 21 cars burned Monday night at the height of the blaze, BNSF said in a statement sent to MailOnline.

The remainder of the cars not on fire have already been towed from the scene, the statement added.

BNSf confirmed that no injuries occurred as a result of the double derailment.

mr Faust declined to say how 
many cars each train had, but Valley News Live reported the crude oil 
train was at least 111 cars long.

The evacuation order was handed down by the Cass county Sheriff's Office and first reported by Valley News Live. BNSF was unaware of the order, and sounded taken aback by it when questioned about it by MailOnline.

Temperatures are expected to drop to about minus-20 degrees Fahrenheit this evening across the region, Mr Faust noted - which makes the ordeal even tougher for local residents.

Authorities are evacuating the rural town in expectation of winds shifting and sending the toxic smoke straight for Casselton, Valley News Live noted.

A Valley News Live reporter tweeted that even from a far distance away, she could feel the heat on her face.

Thick black smoke pushed even higher, and could be seen for miles, multiple train cars filled with oil began burning.

The explosions shook homes and rattled locals.

'The sky is totally black from smoke,' Eva Fercho told Inforum. 'I could almost feel the house shake in that [second explosion], she added, 'it was loud.'

Authorities told WDAY they have decided to let the out of control flames rage until all the oil has burned off.

Mr Rogness told the Tribune that multiple cars filled with oil and ethanol caught fire, and attempts by MailOnline to reach multiple agencies were unsuccessful.

The derailment occurred not far from Casselton’s ethanol plant, leading authorities to advise locals to stay inside.
