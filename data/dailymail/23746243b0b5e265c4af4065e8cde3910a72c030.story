A 3-year-old boy has been beaten to death and his mother's boyfriend, who fled into nearby woods following the incident, is in custody.

Sheriff's deputies were called to a home in Georgia's Forsyth County at about 11 a.m. Tuesday and found the toddler, who neighbors identified as 'Wyatt,' unresponsive.

Deputy Doug Rainwater said the mom's boyfriend fled into the woods behind the neighborhood after calling the child's mother to say something was wrong.

The mother rushed home and immediately called 911, Rainwater told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

The child was rushed to Northside Hospital-Forsyth but despite resuscitation attempts, he was pronounced dead.

More than three dozen deputies used dogs to track the man into the woods and he was accosted just before 1:45 p.m. near the intersection of Georgia 369 and Georgia 400.

He was taken into custody and Rainwater said investigators are questioning him and the mother, both of whom haven't been identified.

Police said the man is at this stage only considered a person of interest in the case.

No details have been released about the child's cause of death. However, Rainwater said they do consider the death 'suspicious.'

The neighborhood was in shock after the child's death, which came days after another local toddler was killed.

'It is very shocking,' Empress Ming told the Journal Constitution. 'I can't believe it.'

A vigil for the boy was held Tuesday night in the Bridgetowne subdivision where the boy and his mother lived.

'Everybody's out here out of love and concern,' neighbor Lakshmi Shri said.

The tragic death comes after three-year-old Lela Bemis was suffocated by her mother, Meriel Bemis, on Sunday while the woman was arguing with her boyfriend.

She was charged with felony murder but waived her first court appearance after confessing to her daughter's murder.
