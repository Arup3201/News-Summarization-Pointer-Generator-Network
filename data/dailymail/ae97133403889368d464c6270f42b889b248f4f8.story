Last night saw a galaxy of Britain's most famous stars hit the red 
carpet to celebrate the small screen's biggest night: the Arqiva TV BAFTA Awards 
2014

On one of the hottest days of the year so far, the creme de la creme of the small screen descended on the Theatre
 Royal, Drury Lane, in London's West End and brought the glamour of Hollywood with them.

Thespians such as Helena Bonham Carter, Olivia Colman and Keeley Hawes looked picture perfect as 
they faced a gauntlet of flashbulbs. But, however genetically blessed 
they may be, you can be sure they didn't wake up looking that flawless.

Big night: Last night saw the best British TV talent hit the red carpet to celebrate the small screen's biggest night: the Arqiva TV BAFTA Awards 2014

From
 expert make-up artists to nail technicians - and, of course, fake tanners -
 the A-listers called in their loyal team of experts who worked like a 
well-oiled machine to ensure that they were ready for their close ups.

FEMAIL went backstage at last night's event to get the low-down on the star's fashion and beauty preparations.

Before the stars hit the red carpet, they checked into a swanky suite at the Corinthia Hotel where MAC cosmetics, Mark Hill hair, St. Tropez tanners, CARAT jewelers and House Of Fraser fashion experts were on hand to spruce the actors and actresses up.

The MAC Senior Artists set up camp for the
 11th year running, with an arsenal of products - including Kelly and Sharon Osbourne's latest range, as well as the new Maleficent collection - to help the likes of Caroline Flack, Susanna Reid and Olivia Colman prepare for the glare of the photographers' flashbulbs.

Lady in red: Susanna Reid sat in the hot seat and requested a 'smokey eye and red lip' to match her red BIBA dress from House Of Fraser

MAC Senior Artist, Rebecca 
Butterworth, said of last night's beauty trends: ‘On the red carpet, gorgeous skin with luminescent,
 luxurious highlights dominated, accented with softly lined eyes, 
reminiscent of Audrey Hepburn and lips in shades of coral, vermillion 
and scarlet.’

MAC Senior Artist Dominic Skinner told MailOnline: 'Everybody wants the Kim Kardashian contoured look, it is definitely the most requested. When Kim does hers, it is purely for selfies but I like to tone it down to make it very red carpet ready.'

He also explained that coral is the new red in terms of lipstick for this season. That didn't stop Good Morning Britain presenter Susanna Reid, who was overheard saying: 'I'm wearing a red dress so I wanted to go for a smokey eye and a red lip, would that work?'

Her make-up artist, Dean Rudd, duly applied concrete eyeshadow, and a combination of Lasting Lust and Viva Glam on her lips.

It only took him about fifteen minutes to work his magic on Susanna, who was enjoying the 80s music blaring.

As for her tan, Susanna went for a glamorous look to complement her red dress. 'Susanna’s look is all about
 the "backsie" tan thanks to her gorgeous Spanish-inspired backless 
dress,' said Jules Heptonstall, St.Tropez Tanning and Skin Finishing Expert, who was on hand to give the stars their golden glow.

'Susanna had 
two generous coats of St.Tropez’s new Self Tan Express mist two days 
prior to the TV BAFTAs, paying particular attention to her back, which 
she left on for three hours before washing off.'

X Factor presenter Caroline Flack also checked into the MAC beauty suite and spent a good half an hour in the hot seat - popping back just before she stepped onto the red carpet for a final touch up (and frantically scoured the suite for some nude nail varnish).

The TV presenter debated between a glossy or matte lip, all while singing along to the 80s tunes pumping out.

She had her favourite MAC Face and Body swept over her face (Caroline loves to use this on those often-displayed legs, too) and went for a smokey eye.

Hairwise, she opted for 
Mark Hill's Gothic Glamour style to go with her black 50s style prom dress. 

'I 
created this look using my Extreme Wicked Waver by tonging each
 section and pinning the curls to cool. My top tip for soft waves like 
these is to brush them out gently afterwards,' said the hairdresser.

Fresh faced glow: Olivia Coleman, the leading lady of the evening, went for a fresh look achieved with MAC's skin brightening serum and completed with a peal highlighter and Lady Danger lipstick

Glowgetter: Laura Whitmore, who is naturally very pale, was given a fake tan by St. Tropez. She opted for the Grecian Goddess look because she was keen not to look too washed out in her white dress

Laura Whitmore went for the Grecian Goddess tanned look. 'Laura is naturally very pale so she loves self tan and was keen not to look washed out in her gorgeous cream number,' explained Jules.

'To create her look I sprayed her with St.Tropez’s new Express mist which she left on for two hours to develop to a medium golden glow.'

Speaking about her hairstyle, Mark Hill said: 'Laura Whitmore stunned on the red carpet
 this year with gorgeous Hollywood waves.

'I swept these to the side to 
complement her chic halter neck dress and emphasise her gorgeous high 
cheekbones. Add shine to a style like this with a spritz of Bedazzled 
Anti Humidity Shine Spray.'

As for Millie Mackintosh, who has a penchant for a golden glow, Jules gave her the Glamazonian.

Remember me? Olivia Newman Young, who starred on last season's Made In Chelsea, helped Millie Mackintosh, right, get ready for the big event

'Millie’s futuristic, metallic dress needed really polished looking skin to complete the high shine look. I used St.Tropez Instant Tan to shade and contour her arms, applying with a foundation brush for an airbrushed finish. I then buffed her skin with a dual fibre brush and highlighted her shoulders using St.Tropez Gold Skin Illuminator for a high fashion finish.' 

1. Millie’s hair was prepped with Work it Girl Shine Protect and Control spray (£5.99)

2. Using the Session Styling Cushion Brush (£8.99),  Mark swept Millie's hair back towards her crown and secured into a high ponytail using a covered band.

3.  To create a sleek twist, he then wrapped a small section of hair around the base of the ponytail to cover the hair band, and used Leopard Ceramic Styler straighteners (£99.99) to glide over the ponytail itself to ensure a smooth finish.

4. The red carpet look was finished with a spritz of Bedazzled Anti - Humidity Shine spray (£5.49) which smoothed away any frizz and flyaways and added a gorgeous shine

Although Millie is a trained make-up artist herself, she called on her friend Olivia Newman Young, who also starred in the last season of Made In Chelsea, to give her a makeover.

Speaking about her beauty look, Millie said: 'I wanted to do something very different from last year. I am making the most of having this gorgeous tan, I love having a sunkissed glow, it's my go-to look.

'I wanted to take that onto my eye as well so I went for a really bronzed smokey eye, sunkissed glow skin and a vampy lip to match.'

To achieve Millie's flawless skin, Olivia buffed Armani Designer Lift Foundation onto her skin and used Soleil Tan de Chanel bronzer, which she applied with an angled MAC brush, where the sun would hit her face.

She then used a shadow to contour and enhance Millie's cheekbones and define her face - even popping some foundation onto her ears because Millie decided to wear her hair up.

She defined her brows with a HD brow palette and used MAC's coffee eye pencil around Millie's lashes, which she smudged to create a smokey effect.

Tanorexic? Speaking about Claudia Winkleman's look, celebrity tanner Jules said: 'Claudia is a self-confessed tanning addict so I wanted to try something new with her for the BAFTAs. Instead of her usual DIY job, I gave her an all over healthy glow'

Millie completed the look with her Belgravia lashes - from her own range - and a dramatic plum lip using Vino lip pencil and Hang Up lipstick from MAC.

'I love this look. It's vampy and very high fashion,' said a pleased Millie.

Stylist and TV presenter Courtney Smith said of Millie's look: 'Millie went Gothic with the dark lips but shines bright in a fully sequined metallic column dress, which was flawless against her dewy iridescent skin and long lean frame.'

Hair wizard: Celebrity hairdresser Mark Hill and official hair partner to the Arqiva BAFTA TV Awards, takes us through how he created Millie Mackintosh's sleek red carpet hairstyle

Mark Hill worked his magic on Millie's sleek hairstyle, using plenty of products to help it stay in place.

He also worked on Coronation street star Samia Ghadie, who opted for an elegant up-do, which Mark accessorised with diamante pins to add a little extra glamour.

'An un-done chignon is an easy style to re-create yourself. My top tip is to add bite and texture through the hair first using a sea salt spray. This will make it easier to style,' he advised.

Speaking about Inbetweeners star Emily Atack, who wore Mary Portas, Mark said: 'Emily has gorgeous thick hair, and wanted a relaxed sexy style to play up her tuxedo outfit. 

'I created a bit of dishevelled texture using a Rock Chick Wave wand, but didn’t pin the curls to cool, so they’d drop to create more of a natural kink.

'Add volume at the roots for some extra vava voom using some dry shampoo.'
