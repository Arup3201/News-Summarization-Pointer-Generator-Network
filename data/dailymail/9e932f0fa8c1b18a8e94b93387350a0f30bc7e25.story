No thanks: An armed robber near Central Park in New York handed this LG Quantum cellphone back to his target because it was outdated

One Brookyln man's defense against a recent theft was his sense of thrift.

Kevin Cook, 25, was walking with a friend near Central Park in New YorkÂ  around 12:30am Saturday when a gun-wielding robber told Mr Cook and his friend to hand over their valuables - threatening the two with death if they didn't stay quiet.

But the mugger was less than impressed with Mr Cook's three-year-old cell phone, a 2010 LG Quantum with a sliding keyboard.

'Once he saw my phone, he looked at it like, "What the f*** is this?" and gave it back to me,' Mr Cook told the New York Post.

'I guess he didn't think he could get anything for it,' he added. 'It's kind of humorous.'

But
 the weren't completely off the hook. The robbers got away with a 
briefcase, a wallet containing $114 in cash and his friend's more 
lucrative cellphone.

'It
 saved me one stop on what I would need to replace after things went 
down. I mean, my friend had to replace everything but at least I still 
had a phone,' Mr Cook told CBS New York.

The
 two assailants were able to escape before police showed up, which was lucky 
considering Mr Cook used his passed-over cellphone to call 911.

Police
 described the armed robber as a 6-foot-tall black male in his early 20s
 with a slim build. He was wearing a dark green winter coat and blue 
jeans.

His
 accomplice was described as a Hispanic male in his late 20s, 5-foot-6, 
slim build and wearing his long black hair in a pony tail.

Mr Cook, a New York Sports Club sales representative, and his friend were walking near Central Park West Drive at West 64th Street when the incident happened.

This was the thirteenth robbery reported in Central Park this year, which is the same number as last year.

According to the NYPD's crime tracker map, the southwest corner of Central Park seems to be a hot spot for robberies.
