Facing jail: Rama Yade is accused of using false addresses to get on the electoral list to become a councillor and faces up to three years in prison

The youngest ever black Muslim woman to become a French cabinet minister was today facing jail for electoral fraud.

Rama Yade, who is still only 36, was due to appear at Nanterre Correctional Court charged with a range of forgery offences.

She became a hugely glamorous symbol of ethnic diversity when, barely out of her 20s in 2007, President Nicolas Sarkozy made her Secretary of State for Human Rights.

But today she was accused of using a business address and empty flat to get on to the electoral list to become a councillor at Colombes, the commuter town north west of Paris.

Yade, who was born in Senegal, was actually brought up in a council flat in the impoverished suburb, but later moved out.

According to the charge sheet, she offered the address of a commercial property to election organisers in December 2009, and then - in 2011 - falsely claimed to be living in a new apartment.

There was an official investigation into her 'change of address' and the Electoral Commission found her new flat was actually an empty one.

She now faces up to three years in prison and a fine equivalent to almost £40,000 for breaking electoral law and being ineligible for an election.

Ms Yade also faces a further year in prison for making false official declarations.

Ms Yade insists that the first address was a legitimate one, and that the second flat was only empty because of 'water damage'.

'There was no intention to defraud,' said her lawyer, barrister Antonin Levy, who added that the charges were 'simply a way of exploiting justice' to prevent Ms Yade 'running in the municipal elections in 2014'.

The initial prosecution against Ms Yade was initiated by Philip Sarre, the Socialist mayor of Colombes.

He has always been a fierce opponent of the conservative Ms Yade, who was once a key ally of Mr Sarkozy.

Mr Sarkozy was frequently criticised for not doing enough for ethnic minorities, and was accused of championing young Muslim women like Ms Yade for cynical electoral purposes.

She became Sports Minister for two years up until 2010, but ended up falling out with Mr Sarkozy.

Last year she left his party, the UMP, and joined the Union of Democrats and Independents party of Jean-Louis Borloo, but failed to get elected as an MP.

She is married to the Yiddish singer, Joseph Zimet, and is now working for a human resources firm in Paris.
