Two fisherman rescued in the Russian wilderness ate the corpse of their 
friend in order to survive after vanishing in one of the most remote 
places in the world, it was reported yesterday.

Alexander Abdullaev, 37, and Alexei Gradulenko, 35, were plucked to 
safety by a helicopter having survived temperatures lower than -30C 
three months after embarking on their Yakutia fishing trip.

Police discovered fragments of a human corpse at their campsite, which 
prompted officers to launch a murder probe amid cannibalism concerns.
But officers now believe they ate the man after he died.

Survivor: Alexander Abdullaev is one of two men suspected of resorting to cannabalism in order to survive

Warmed up: Alexei Gradulenko, 35, was plucked to safety by a helicopter having survived the temperatures

‘During questioning, one of the witnesses testified that cannibalism did
indeed take place,’ a source close to the investigation told the 
Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pranda. ‘It was not murder.’

The source added that Mr Abdullaev and Mr Gradulenko ate the man after 
he died from the harsh conditions. The two survivors were not arrested 
but had been treated as witnesses in a murder case.

The group of four men went missing in August during their trip in the 
Russian Far East, and these dramatic pictures showed two of them being rescued and 
taken to safety at the end of November.

Mr Abdullayev confessed that he and Mr Gradulenko fed themselves with 
the flesh of Andrei Kurochkin, 44, for weeks after he froze to death, 
investigators told Yakutia newsite NVPress.ru.

Mr Abdullayev was flown out by investigators to find the fourth man, 
Viktor Komarov, 47, and they did discover the fishermen's UAZ jeep – but failed
to find Mr Komarov either alive or dead.

The survivors strongly denied they killed their friends and claimed to 
have left them at a deserted gold digger's house while they tried to 
seek help, reported the Siberian Times earlier this month.

Mr Abdullaev and Mr Gradulenko were found by the Sutam River around 155
miles from the nearest town of Neryungri. The men had covered 94 miles 
on foot after their jeep broke down.

Reports of cannibalism have previously emerged in Russia during some of the darkest periods of the country's past.

There were said to be instances of cannibalism in remote Gulags - the Soviet system of forced labour camps established under Stalin.

In 1933, 6,000 people were deported en masse from Moscow and Leningrad to isolated Nazino Island in Western Siberia. The plan was for settlers to bring virgin land into production and ultimately become self-sufficient. In reality, they were abandoned on a desolate island with nothing to eat but flour, a few tools, and insufficient clothing. Already weak from the five day journey to the island, during which they received virtually no food, the settlers were given only flour to mix with river water upon arrival, and malnutrition and dysentery was widespread. Reports of people resorting to cannibalism in near anarchical conditions on the island were rife. Of 6,000 people deported to Nazino, 4,000 died.

The devastating famine caused by the two and a half year Siege of Leningrad, which lasted from September 8 1941 until January 27 1944 and saw around 800,000 people starve to death, led to rumours and reports of cannibalism emerging after supplies of birds, rats and pets had been exhausted.

During the winter from 1941 to 1942, there were reports of hungry gangs attacking and eating people. Police in Leningrad were said to have established a special unit to combat cannibalism, and 260 people were reportedly jailed for the crime during this period.
