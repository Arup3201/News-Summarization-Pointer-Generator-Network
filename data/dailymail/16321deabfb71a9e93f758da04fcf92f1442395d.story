The Russian owner of The Independent launched an attack on Government plans to restrict Press freedom, just days after his newspaper gave full support to the proposals.

Alexander Lebedev, who also owns the London Evening Standard, said: ‘The restrictions of the freedom of the press in Britain – I would think that would be a very wrong decision. Absolutely.

‘There are better ways to rectify the wrong things that have been done during the hacking affair.’

Alexander Lebedev warned that press regulation would be a bad thing for the British media

Earlier this week, The Independent’s editor Chris Blackhurst was the only national newspaper editor to back the Royal Charter scheme for Press regulation. 

He said: ‘This isn’t perfect but neither is it terrible. I don’t see anything in it that will threaten the sort of journalism we produce at The Independent.’

But by Thursday the newspaper was expressing serious doubts, its leader column talking of ‘potentially critical flaws’ in the proposals.

Meanwhile the veteran Labour-supporting magazine Tribune yesterday became the latest well-known periodical to reject the Charter, saying ‘we will not be signing up to any new procedure for imposing state licensing of  the Press’.

Education Secretary Michael Gove also joined the chorus of criticism, saying the clampdown on the Press in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal is having a ‘chilling effect’ on free speech.

In a sign of growing Tory unease, Mr Gove also said he was ‘uncomfortable’ about the controversial deal stitched up by the three main party leaders last Sunday to introduce a new Press regulator.

And he warned that the arrests of dozens of journalists, public officials and whistleblowers posed a serious potential threat to free speech.

His intervention came as pressure group Hacked Off announced an embarrassing climbdown over aspects of the Government’s Royal Charter on Press regulation, which it helped draw up. 

The group, whose directors include the actor Hugh Grant, called for changes to remove a ‘glitch’ in the proposals that would leave thousands of internet bloggers facing the threat of ruinous damages.

It came just days after prominent Hacked Off supporter Max Mosley said the Government should be able to ‘cut off the wires’ of Internet publications that erred.

Speaking to BBC’s Question Time, Mr Gove, a former senior journalist at the Times, contrasted the clampdown on the Press with the lack of arrests in the wake of other scandals, such as the banking collapse or the deaths of up to 1,200 patients at Mid Staffordshire Hospital.

Kate and Gerry McCann have also been prominent campaigners for restrictions on the press

He said David Cameron had secured the ‘best deal available’, given Labour and the Liberal Democrats had ganged up to back new Press laws. But he indicated he remained deeply uneasy about the threat to free speech. 

He said: ‘The free Press is one of the historic strengths of this country. Sometimes it is raucous and, as a politician, you can sometimes be on the receiving end – so you should.

‘A free Press should hold people to account. That is why I am uncomfortable about politicians themselves deciding how the Press should be regulated. My view is a minority in the Commons.’ He added: ‘We have had scores of journalists arrested – I suspect some will face their day in court. 

The Independent expressed support for the royal charter when most national newspapers didn't

‘I don’t know how many people responsible for some of the banking scandals which cause so much misery to so many have been arrested.

‘I’ve seen no arrests when there have been other scandals from Mid Staffs and elsewhere where people have suffered.

‘We are in danger – with a newspaper industry which is suffering commercially – of driving to the margins the organs of free speech.

‘Frankly it is more important that politicians fear proper scrutiny than that the Press fear politicians scrutinising them.’ 

Nick Clegg yesterday appealed to the newspaper industry not to boycott the scheme, adding: ‘I hope when tempers cool a bit and the dust settles, people will see it’s the middle way.’

Thousands of internet bloggers have come together under the umbrella campaign Blog Off, calling for small publications to be excluded from the proposals. It even has the backing of Labour’s deputy chairman Tom Watson, who has led the campaign for Press regulation.

Tory peer Lord Lucas last night tabled an amendment to the Crime and Courts Bill which would remove individual Internet bloggers and most small publishers from the provisions of the Royal Charter. The Government has not yet indicated whether it will support the change.

Meanwhile former Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown will today accuse Mr Cameron of making a colossal ‘strategic blunder’ in pulling out of talks on the creation of a new Press regulator.
