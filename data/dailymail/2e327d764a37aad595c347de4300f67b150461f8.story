Actor Jason Patric hurled anti-Semitic slurs at the mother of his child in public and hit her with a phone, according to his ex-girlfriend.

Patric has been locked in a legal battle with Danielle Schreiber over the custody of their 4-year-old son, Gus, who was conceived through in-vitro fertilization.

After initially being denied visitation rights under a puzzling California law that does not recognize the paternal rights of unmarried sperm donors, Patric scored a major legal victory.

Bitter fight: Patric's ex-girlfriend Danielle 
Schreiber, seen in court earlier this month barred the actor from seeing their 
son on the grounds that as a sperm donor, he has no parental rights

Last week, a California appeals court sided with the 47-year-old star of The Lost Boys, clearing the way for Patric to fight for legal recognition as Gus' father.

The actor has been sitting down for TV interviews and recruiting his celebrity friends to promote his cause.

But according to court documents filed by his ex-girlfriend, Danielle Schreiber, her son's biological father does not deserve public sympathy because he was verbally and physically abusive during their decade-long relationship.

Schreiber claimed that Patric slammed her head against the wall, struck her with a telephone receiver and regularly called her 'Jew c***' and 'Ms Jew lawyer,' apparently referring to her prominent jurist father, TMZ reported. 

The woman's court filings stated that on one occasion, Patric went to their son's pre-school and addressed her in public as 'Ms Jew Schreiber.'

Last November, Ms Schreiber obtained a restraining order against Patric prohibiting him from contacting her.

The actor's attorney, Fred Silberberg, dismissed Schreiber’s allegations of anti-Semitism and physical abuse as 'categorically untrue.'

‘These disclosures are a last gasp attempt at disparaging Gus’ father ... [They] are desperate comments from a desperate woman,' he told TMZ.

The attorney hit back at the woman, noting that if her claims were true, she would not have spent years living with Patric and undergoing fertility treatments to conceive a baby with him.

On her part, Schreiber said through 
her attorney, Patty Glaser, that like many victims of domestic violence,
 it took her a long time to realize that she does not have to accept her
 mistreatment.

‘The fact 
that the domestic violence restraining order was issued after a family 
court judge heard Ms. Schreiber's and Mr. Patric's testimony speaks for 
itself,’ said Glaser.

Patric
 biologically fathered Gus with his former girlfriend in 2010 and 
conceived the child via in-vitro fertilization after their separation, 
co-parenting for more than a year before they split permanently.

In February 2013, the actor lost a court 
battle to gain visitation rights with Gus under a state law that 
grants the mother full custody in the absence of a written agreement 
establishing the sperm donor's parental rights before conception.

At an earlier court hearing it was said that because Patric donated his sperm, he was classified as a 'sperm donor' and had no parental rights since he and Schreiber were not married at the time of the baby's conception.

In addition, Patric never signed a birth certificate, Schreiber said.

In a statement to ABC News, Schreiber said Patric offered to donate sperm after the two broke up 'under the express condition' that it be kept secret and 'that he would not be a father to or have any obligations, rights or responsibilities for my child.'

A judge at the earlier court hearing agreed and Patric was barred from seeing Gus.

Last week's ruling means that Patric is legally entitled to seek paternity rights in court.

Daddy's little boy: Patric, 47, seen with Gus in Hawaii a few years ago, says he has been a real father to the boy from the day of his birth 

California appeals court judge Thomas Willhite said that the presumption against in-vitro fathers shouldn't be 'so categorical,' and that the family law code 'does not preclude a donor from establishing that he is a presumed father.'

Patric and Schreiber, who had dated off and on for about 10 years, split for good in June 2012. He filed a paternity claim shortly thereafter.

The actor has been forbidden by Schreiber, who currently is the sole legal parent, from seeing Gus for more than a year.

Ms 
Schreiber, 41, a massage therapist and the daughter of a prominent 
Connecticut lawyer, said her on-again, off-again boyfriend never signed 
their son's birth certificate.

Moreover, the woman said in a statement to ABC News
 that Patric offered to help her conceive a child through in-vitro 
fertilization under the express condition that his sperm donation be 
kept secret, and that he would have no parental rights or obligations.

A judge in a lower court sided with the mother, striping Patric of visitation rights.

The former teen heartthrob, however, insisted that he has been a father to Gus from the day of his birth.

His lawyers will argue that the actor signed forms at the family planning clinic promising 'an intent to parent.'

Speaking to ABC News earlier this month, Patric said the last time he saw his son was 63 weeks ago – even though he lives only 10 minutes away.

‘I said, “It's OK. I'll see you tomorrow.” I've never seen him again,’ he recalled. 

Mr Patric is seeking full custody of little Gus in a high-profile case that has raised serious questions about the parental rights of sperm donors. 

Last week, Patric scored a minor legal victory when a judge citing the First Amendment declined to grant Schreiber a restraining order in order to prevent her ex-boyfriend from using their son's name in an advocacy group he had created called 'Stand Up for Gus,' according to The Hollywood Reporter.

Patric’s public campaign has gained some traction in Hollywood, with A-listers like Mark Wahlberg, Chris Rock, Jon Hamm and Mel Gibson lending their support to the cause.

The 47-year-old actor, who is the grandson of The Honeymooners star Jackie Gleason, has spent the past year going around giving interviews and speaking out about the rights of sperm donors at fundraisers for his foundation.

Last July, Patric sat down with Katie Couric for an interview about his legal battle, telling the TV presenter that Gus was stolen from him because of an outdated legal stature that does not recognize the parental rights of sperm donors in those cases where the mother and father are no longer together.

Patric and Schreiber first met in 2002 when he came to her for a massage and struck up a romance, The New York Times reported. In 2009, the Sleepers star offered his on-again, off-again girlfriend to help her conceive a child through in-vitro fertilization.

Gus’ birth had initially helped the couple rebuild their rocky relationship, but three years later they broke up for good, and soon after the actor says he was abruptly barred from having contact with his son. 

On her part, Schreiber said during an interview on NBC's Today Show last July that Patric doesn't deserve any rights to Gus.

'It's not about him having a relationship or contact with Gus. This is just about rights,' she said.

'Me preserving my right to be a sole legal parent, not having to share that with someone who has never intended to and never raised Gus, even when we were dating — Jason never did anything to raise Gus. He never changed a single diaper,' she said.

But Patric - who refers to himself as Gus’ ‘Dada’ online – continues to insists that he has been a real father to the toddler, even taking him to be circumcised when he was eight days old.
