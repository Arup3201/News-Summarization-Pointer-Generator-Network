A  helicopter pilot has been kicked out of the RAF for taking cocaine at a party where he boasted to a female colleague of his drug-fuelled sexual exploits.

Squadron Leader Michael Hayes, 43, who has flown dangerous missions around the world, snorted the drug at a 1970s-themed fancy dress party at RAF Odiham in Hampshire.

A group of officers downed cocktails, wine, champagne and spirits at the pre-Christmas gathering in the mess before continuing the festivities in Hayes’s room.

The divorcee, who has a seven-year-old son, had been accused of supplying the drug but instead was convicted of the lesser charge of possession, which he had admitted.

He was dismissed from his £50,000-a-year post following a 24-year career at a sentencing hearing yesterday. The criminal record will also prevent him from becoming a commercial pilot.

Judge Advocate Michael Elsom told him: ‘Those in possession put at risk not just their lives but the lives of those with whom they serve. Continued service in the RAF as far as you are concerned is impossible.’

His fall from grace happened on December 9 last year when officers shared a meal together and played drinking games.

Flight Lieutenant Kayleigh Warriner described how Hayes made lurid claims about his love life as they chatted at the mess bar. ‘I asked him about a woman who had been in the mess a couple of times with him,’ she said. ‘He said they weren’t exclusive to each other. 

He mentioned an incident in the mess where he said he nearly had a threesome with this woman and another female.’ She asked whether it had been ‘awkward’ afterwards and he said: ‘That’s what coke does to you.’

The junior officer said the conversation turned to drugs again when she joined about a dozen other people in Hayes’s room in the base’s living quarters.

He ‘kept mentioning it’ and Flt Lt Warriner said she challenged him, saying: ‘Well, show me then.’

The hearing at Colchester Garrison in Essex was told they walked into his bedroom where he took out a ‘pale, square-shaped’ wrap and said: ‘What do you think? We could do it right now.’

Flight lieutenant Emily Mather described falling asleep on Hayes’s sofa. She later woke to see everyone had left except Hayes and a flying officer and noticed there were ‘lines of white powder on the table’.

‘At one point Squadron Leader Hayes stated something along the lines of “I can’t believe we’ve done the whole gram of coke. I think we should get more for Friday”,’ she said.

RAF Police raided the squadron leader’s room later that morning after colleagues reported him. A search found evidence of cocaine use and Hayes, of High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, was arrested. He later failed a drugs test.

Christopher Martin, representing Hayes, said his client was not a ‘habitual user’ of drugs.

Flying Officer David Sinclair, of Carshalton, south-west London, was cleared of possessing cocaine and conduct prejudicial to good order.
