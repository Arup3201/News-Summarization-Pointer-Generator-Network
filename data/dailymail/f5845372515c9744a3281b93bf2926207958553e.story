Some New Yorkers too caught up in the rat race to make breakfast at home grab it to go from Dunkin' Donuts, but they may want to rethink that bagel after watching these videos.

Two videos uploaded to YouTube on Tuesday show rats crawling around a New York City Dunkin' Donuts location in the Garmnet District.

In the first video, uploaded by user 'Pjayone', a rat is seen making its way from the top of a display rack, touching croissants, bagels and other baked goods in open tubs.

Rat home: The vermin spotting allegedly took place at this Dunkin' Donuts location in New York's Garment District

The second video shows yet another rat crawling up a window curtain at the same location on 37th Street and 8th Avenue.

'New York runs on Dunkin', just ask this rat,' a man is recorded saying in the background.

In an email to Gothamist, the YouTube user explains that this is a normal occurrence  at the location.

'At two-thirty [in the morning] every [day] the workers load the shelves with the morning's wares. Shortly thereafter like clockwork the rats come out and party.'

'My phone ran out of power, or I would've filmed the outright nine deep rat assault which followed the action above,' he added.

'The items in the video that are being besieged upon by the rats were to be sold for that mornings breakfast rush.'

The location captured in the video has an 'A' rating from the city's health department, despite getting a citation for vermin-related issues in November 2013.

The citation called the facility 'not vermin proof. Harboarge or conditions conductive to attracting vermin to the premises and/or allowed vermin to exist.'

When contacted by Gothamist, the location manager said simply: 'We don't have an issue like that.'

Dunkin' Donuts' corporate offices issued their own statement, saying 'food safety is a top priority'.

'We have stringent food safety and quality standards, and we take great pride in the food and beverages we serve to our guests every day.

'We take this matter very seriously. Immediately upon learning of the situation at the Dunkin' Donuts restaurant at 265 West 37th Street, a certified Operations Manager inspected the restaurant to ensure that all appropriate Dunkin’ Donuts food safety standards are being followed.'

On the coffee and donut run: A Gothamist reporter stood outside the location on Wednesday, showing the video to regulars

Regulars: The lady on the left was surprisingly unbothered by the rat spotting, while her friend on the right was considerably unsettled

'Ew. That's disgusting' was all this woman had to say about the rat video

On Wednesday, Gothamist reporters showed the video to several regulars outside the location, and their reactions were surprisingly mixed.

One woman with a strong New York accent seemed unbothered since she had never personally seen a rat.

'The rats come out at night. We're living in a big town. There's rats all over the place,' she said.

Another man said he wouldn't be visiting that location anymore while one woman said: 'Ew. That is disgusting'.
