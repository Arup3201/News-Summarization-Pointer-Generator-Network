It was a day of wild celebration in New Orleans as the Saints won the National Football Conference South title and their star quarterback Drew Brees broke a 27-year single-season passing record.

New Orleans Saints beat Atlanta Falcons 45-16 on Monday night as Brees broke Dan Marino’s record from 1984 of 5,084 yards with the final pass of the game to set a new record of 5,087.

Brees achieved the feat with one game to go - but his new record could still be beaten again this season by New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who is currently on 4,897 yards.

Brees came into the game needing 305 to beat Miami Dolphins legend Marino’s record and made 307, breaking the record with a nine-yard touchdown pass to Darren Sproles with three minutes left.

The New Orleans crowd gave Brees a raucous ovation and the Saints called a timeout to mark the milestone. ‘Honestly, I was trying not to think about the record. I knew we were close,’ he said.

‘I got (rushed) by the offensive lineman and I figured at that point, “Ok, I guess we finally broke the record or they wouldn't be hoisting me up like this”. So many people contributed to this.’

Minutes after Brees broke the record, Marino tweeted: ‘Great job by such a special player’.

Drew Brees

Brees threw two touchdown passes in each half as the Saints raced to a 21-10 half-time lead, and their defence and special teams snuffed out any Atlanta hopes of a comeback.

A 92-yard kick return by Sproles set up a field goal that put the Saints ahead 31-13 in the third, and Malcolm Jenkins returned a fumble 30 yards for a touchdown in the fourth quarter for a 38-16 lead.

Brees then punctuated the win with his fourth touchdown pass of the night on his record-breaking throw to Sproles.

The Saints have won seven successive games and head into the season's final game against Carolina with a chance to grab the NFC's number two seed if they win and San Francisco lose.

The Falcons, also heading to the playoffs, suffered their second loss this season to New Orleans.

Dan Marino

Matt Ryan threw for 373 yards and briefly gave Atlanta a 10-7 lead in the first quarter on a 21-yard pass to Julio Jones.

Jones finished with eight catches for 128 yards, alongside team mate Roddy White's 11 catches and 127 yards, but the Falcons managed only two field goals and could not keep pace.

‘Obviously, it's a special moment for the players, especially Drew,’ Saints coach Sean Payton said. ‘I couldn't be more proud of him.’
