Oprah doesn't like first lady Michelle Obama because she's a show off Edward Klein's new book, Blood Feud, alleges.

The legendary talk show host was once a close friend and adviser of the president's, but she had a falling out with the first family during the president's first term in office.

'It appeared to Oprah that Michelle was 
jealous of her, furious that Barack was seeking her advice instead of 
Michelle's,' a source close to Winfrey told Klein.

The other woman: Oprah, pictured here in May, thinks Michelle Obama doesn't like her because the president takes Oprah's advice over his wife's, a source close to Oprah told Blood Feud author Edward Klein

'For her part, Oprah didn't like being with Michelle, because
 the first lady was constantly one-upping the president and anybody else
 around her. '

At another point in the book Oprah is quoted as saying that the Obamas make her 'jumpy.'

Oprah reportedly told a friend that ' "even when the Obamas think they are being 
charming, they hold you at arm’s length." '

Obama had no stronger ally than Oprah throughout his first campaign for president, including the time he was competing against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic Party nomination.

Winfrey, who is oft labeled as the most influential woman in the world, is credited with securing both the party nomination and the presidency for Obama, attracting a million votes or more for her candidate in the general election, according to two economists.

Oprah lent not only her credibility to Barack Obama's campaign, endorsing the Illinois Senator's candidacy before he officially announced his intentions to seek higher office, she barnstormed the country headlining rallies and fundraisers for Barack.

The night Obama accepted the Democratic nomination in 2008, Oprah gushed to reporters, 'I've never experienced anything like that.'

'I cried my eyelashes off,' she said.

'And what I saw with Barack Obama was something that was
 transcendent and I felt transformational for me as a human being and 
for this country.

'I often wondered what it would be like to sit and 
listen to Lincoln speak or Roosevelt speak or what it would have been 
like to have been old enough to understand what Martin Luther King was 
saying 45 years ago today,' Oprah said.

'And what he did brought that home in a way 
that I could never have imagined,' she added. 'I didn’t not endorse him.'

In January of 2009, Oprah flew to Washington to celebrate with her friends Barack and Michelle.

She taped her show in D.C., shared a private dinner with the newly minted first couple, attended several inauguration balls and partied at the White House.

That was the first and last time the Obamas laid out the red carpet for Winfrey after they moved into the White House, Blood Feud suggests.

Klein writes that 'Oprah had been promised unique access to the White House by Obama if he won.

'She would get regular briefings on administration initiatives and advance notice on programs, which would give her invaluable material for her fledgling cable venture, OWN, the Oprah Winfrey Network,' he said.

' "There were big plans," ' Oprah's confidant told Klein.

Instead, the Obama's snubbed Winfrey after Barack settled into his new role as the leader of the free world.

' " It slowly dawned on Oprah that the Obamas had absolutely no intention of keeping their word and bringing her into their confidence," ' the source said.

Winfrey retaliated by prohibiting stories about the Obama's from appearing in her magazine, O, and vowed not to campaign for Barack in 2012.

' "Oprah was hurt and angry and will never make up with the 
Obamas," ' Winfrey's friend told Klein. ' "She knows how to hold a grudge." '

Oprah blamed Michelle and the president's senior adviser, Valerie Jarrett, directly for double-crossing her.

Jarrett, who's described in the book as Michelle's closest friend, blew off Oprah's many requests to chat about how the White House planned to work with OWN.

' " And just as obviously, President Obama didn't interfere on Oprah's behalf, " ' Klein's source said.

festivities

Given the way she was treated after the 2008 election, it should have come as no surprise to the White House that Winfrey was unavailable to campaign for Barack in 2012.

' "Oprah has turned our back on us," ' former White House Senior Adviser David Plouffe allegedly told Obama during a discussion about the president's re-election campaign.

Jarrett reportedly rebuffed Plouffe and told Obama that Oprah would end up getting on board.

Klein says Jarrett turned out to be wrong, and Oprah 'refused to help.'

' "Oprah isn't going to do sh*t for us in 2012," 'Jarrett was later forced to admit to the president. ' "She refuses to lift a hand. She's going to announce publicly that she isn't going to campaign for us this time around." '

In January 2012 Oprah told CNN she was a '100 percent supporter' of Obama but wouldn't verbally endorse the president.

Four months later Winfrey told CBS' Charlie Rose in an interview that she was 'not going to be out there' campaigning for Obama throughout the summer and fall.

'I’m 100 percent behind our president. I actually love our president, and have the utmost respect for him and that office and what it takes to be there,' Winfrey said. 'I will not be out there because I’m trying to fix a network.'

At the time of Winfrey's announcement, OWN had just laid off 30 employees.

Oprah and the Obamas appeared to be on good terms earlier this year. Winfrey hosted Michelle's 50th birthday party at her Maui, Hawaii, home in January

While Oprah's decision keep her head down during the election is supported by her own statements, claims that her decision was rooted in anger at the Obamas doesn't jive with previous or subsequent events.

In August 2010, more than a year and a half after Barack took office, Winfrey attended the president's 49th birthday party in Chicago.

At a Kennedy Center Honors reception at the White House that December, President Obama had nothing but nice things to say about the billionaire businesswoman.

'Michelle
 and I love Oprah Winfrey - personally love this woman,' he said.

'And the more you know Oprah, the more spectacular you 
realize her character and her soul are and the more you appreciate what a
 wonderful, gifted person she is.'

The month before Winfrey announced she wouldn't campaign for Obama again, she attended a $35,800 a plate fundraiser for the president a at Tyler Perry's home in Atlanta, Georgia.

There, Obama told party guests: 'When Oprah decides she likes you, then other people like you, too.

'She continues to be not just a friend but somebody Michelle and I seek out in thinking about not just the day to day issues … but  in trying to keep our focus on the big picture.

'And what she’s done for so many people not just in America but around the world is extraordinary,' he said.

Barack the backstabber?: A friend of Oprah's told Klein Obama cast Oprah aside soon after he took office

President Barack Obama shakes hands with supporters after speaking at his town hall meeting today at Minnehaha Park, in Minneapolis

Just this past January Winfrey hosted Michelle's 50th birthday party at her home in Maui, Hawaii.

Regardless of how the star-studded event 
appeared on the outside, Michelle Obama and her gal pal Valerie Jarret were no longer in 
Oprah's inner circle at that point, Klein's book claims.

' "On one level, Oprah enjoyed Michelle's visit to Maui and their girly talk," ' a friend of Winfrey's told Klein of Michelle's visit. ' "They had fun together." '

But Michelle, Jarrett and Oprah also had a serious discussion about Barack's sagging popularity, the source said.

' "Valerie and Michelle thought they could charm Oprah back in their camp and get her to use her megawattage to help them dig out of the hole they're in." '

What they didn't realize was that they already ' "blew it," ' said Winfrey's friend.

' "Once you p*ss Oprah off, she she stays p*ssed." '
