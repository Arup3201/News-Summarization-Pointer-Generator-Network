Police negotiators are still trying to bargain with an Alabama gunman, more than 24 hours after he abducted a six-year-old boy from his school bus and held him hostage in his underground bunker.

The suspect, Jimmy Lee Dykes, 65, who also allegedly shot dead the driver of the bus when he tried to protect the children, is described as a 'paranoid survivalist' with 'anti-American views'.

He is fiercely protective of his property in rural Midland City, Alabama. Neighbors said he beat one of their dogs to death with a pipe after it ran onto his land and pulled a gun on the the man who lives next door and his daughter after a dispute over a speed bump.

Authorities say the boy - whose mother calls him 'Love Bug' - is autistic. Dykes has allowed police to pass his medication through a PVC pipe that supplies air to the underground bunker.

Gearing up: A bomb squad unit is also on hand to deal with any possible explosive devices in the bunker

Panic: A suspect, identified as Jimmy Lee Dykes, 65, allegedly held up a school bus Tuesday in Midland City, Alabama, shooting dead the bus driver and taking a boy hostage

The little boy is apparently unhurt and is watching television in the cramped hovel.

The driver is identified as Charles Poland Jr, 66, who has been driving a bus for Dale County Schools since 2009. He is being hailed a hero for trying to stop Dykes from taking the young boy.

Witnesses say Dykes did not know the child and may have been trying to take a hostage to use as leverage in his legal problems.

The Dothan Eagle reports that Dykes was supposed to appear in court on Wednesday for a bench trial over a menacing charge.

Dykes’ neighbor, James Edward Davis Jr 
told the paper that the man pointed a gun at him and his daughter in 
December, saying that they had driven into his yard.

Another neighbor, Claudia Davis said he yelled and fired shots at her, her son and her 
baby grandson over damage Dykes claimed their pickup truck did to a 
makeshift speed bump in the dirt road. No one was hurt.

A girl who was on the school bus when Dykes allegedly stormed it said he referred to his upcoming court case.

'He started talking about how he needed a kid because something about the law coming after him,' she told ABC News.

Dykes' neighbors described him a violent, paranoid man.

Ronda Wilbur, who lived across the road from Dykes, said he beat her 120-pound dog with a lead pipe for coming onto his side of the dirt road. The dog died a week later.

'He said his only regret was he didn't beat him to death all the way,' Wilbur said. She called animal control, who came out and talked to Dykes, but nothing else happened.

'If a man can kill a dog, and beat it with a lead pipe and brag about it, it's nothing until it's going to be people.'

Authorities are reportedly speaking with Dykes through a PVC pipe that runs into the bunker.  

Neighbors say the bunker is about four feet wide, six feet long and eight feet deep and it's covered by several feet of sand. It was intended to be a bomb shelter.

Dykes, a Vietnam veteran, built it by hand.

Rural: The standoff is taking place outside Midland City, Alabama, which is a rural town in the deep southeast of the state, near the Florida border

Cordoned off: Police set up check points and closed off roads all around the scene of the crime and the site where the boy was being held hostage

'It’s the craziest thing. He will be outside in his yard digging dirt at 2.30 in the morning,' Mr Davis told the Eagle.

Dykes habor 'anti-American' and 'anti-government' views, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. He cut down all of the trees on his property, so he could see anyone who approached his house. He also ringed the boarder of his land in barbed wire.

Added Mr Creel: 'He’s the type that thinks the government’s out to get him. He’s not right in the head.'

Neighbors say Dykes boarded the bus and demanded two children to take hostage. The driver, who has worked at Dale County schools since 2009, refused to give up the children and resisted, according to NBC News.

Dykes then shot and killed Poland. The six-year-old boy taken hostage had reportedly fainted on the bus - which is how Dykes was able to carry him away.

'I talked to a girl that was riding the bus, and she told me that he came on the bus and said, "I need two kids between the ages of 6 and 8,"' Michael Creel, Dykes' neighbor, told the Eagle. 'The driver told him, "I can’t do that." (The driver) tried to get away from the guy.'

Children on the bus said that the man who boarded the bus told most of the students to get off. They then said that the man shot the bus driver several times.

Authorities
say the shooter took the child to an area behind nearby Destiny Church.
WSFA reported that bomb squads were called to the scene, though there 
was no sign of explosive devices.

Witness: This student said the gunman ranted about needing a 'child' to 'get the law off his back' - likely a reference to his court appearance that was scheduled for today

Safe: Parents hugged their children tightly after the ordeal on the bus. Witnesses say the gunman was looking for a hostage because of his legal trouble

Residents in the immediate area were also evacuated as a precaution.

Midland City police would not comment, and a call to the Dale City Sheriff's office was not answered Tuesday.

However, it was reported that members of a SWAT team are communicating with the suspect in his bunker via a PVC pipe.

The shooting comes as the nation is on edge about gun violence, especially in schools, after a gunman shot dead 20 students and six staff members at a Connecticut elementary school last month, stoking a national debate on gun control.

The sheriff's department said multiple agencies were assisting with the incident and local area schools would be closed on Wednesday.
