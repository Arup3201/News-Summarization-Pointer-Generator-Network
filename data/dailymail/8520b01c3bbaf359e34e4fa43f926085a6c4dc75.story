Luke Gale scored four tries as Bradford Bulls bowed out of Super League in style by seeing off the London Broncos 46-36 in a thrilling contest in the capital.

The battle between the two relegated sides provided a 14-try affair, with former London star Gale crossing twice in each half.

The Broncos came up with six tries of their own, but were undone by two Bulls scores in the final three minutes from Gale and Manase Manuokafoa.

Bradford Bulls' Luke Gale ran over four tries against London Broncos

London made two changes for the clash which included handing a debut to 18-year-old Alex Walker at full-back, while the Bulls made five changes to their line-up, including their own debutant in the shape of Emmerson Whittel.

With both sides already busy preparing for life in the Championship next season, a strange air hung over The Hive ahead of kick-off. But there was nothing strange about the opening score, as Gale stepped through a handful of tackles to crash over inside four minutes.

Two minutes later it was 12-0, Adam Henry breaking clear and offloading for Gale to romp home for his second score.

The Broncos defence was non-existent, Joe Arundel the next to profit when he took a pass from a scrum and cantered in at the corner after 12 minutes.

London sparked into some sort of life after that, getting on the board when Scott Moore’s short pass allowed skipper Matt Cook to race home midway through the half.

And the hosts moved even closer after 22 minutes as Gale’s long pass was intercepted by Ben Farrar, who in turn offloaded for Joe Keyes to cross at the posts to make it 16-12.

Three minutes later the Londoners were ahead, Josh Drinkwater converting his own try after good work from Keyes and Cook.

By now the hosts really had their tails up, moving 24-16 ahead after 36 minutes when Erjon Dollapi showed great strength to march through three tackles to touch down.

Things could have got even better for the Broncos, only for an apparent try from Oscar Thomas on the hooter to be chalked off for a knock-on.

London were close again minutes into the second half as Drinkwater engineered an overlap, only for Thomas to spill as he raced clear.

The respite proved brief for the Bulls though, Nick Slyney crossing for London’s fifth try from close range on 52 minutes.

Bradford were struggling for answers, but threw themselves a lifeline when Foster’s kick through was seized by Brett Kearney, who grounded with inches to spare to cut the deficit to 30-22.

Suddenly the jitters hit the hosts, the Bulls moving within two points when Jay Pitts surged over on 62 minutes following waves of Bradford pressure. And the visitors eased back into the lead four minutes later when Gale added his third try, rounding off a break from Foster.

The tries kept coming, London rebounding to sneak into a 36-34 lead with 10 minutes to play when Drinkwater surged over for his second score after Thomas had been dragged down short of the line.

Enter Gale for the decisive score, romping home at the sticks after a break from Kearney.

London threw everything into a last-minute assault, only for Bradford to break away, Manuokafoa adding an eighth try for the visitors.
