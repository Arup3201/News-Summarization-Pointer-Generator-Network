Retired businessman Christopher Tappin played a farewell round of golf yesterday at his local Kent club where he has been a member for 50 years.

Next weekend, he will probably be behind bars in one of America’s toughest institutions, facing ‘the worst of all prison nightmares’.

For on Friday, the 65-year-old Kent Golf Society president must report to Heathrow Airport police station where he will surrender to two US marshals who will escort him to Texas to face accusations of selling arms to Iran – a crime that attracts a 35-year prison sentence.

Before retiring, Christopher Tappin (pictured with his wife, Elaine) owned a freight shipping company, Brooklands International. US prosecutors accuse him of helping to buy industrial batteries which were being shipped from America to Iran

On his arrival in Houston, he will be strip-searched, handcuffed and manacled before being taken to a detention centre close to the Mexican border.

If, as expected, he is refused  bail, he will be transferred to a Texan prison to await trial.

Mr Tappin’s case – he was arrested last year on instructions from the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency – has reignited the row over the cross-Atlantic transfer of suspects.

Before retiring in 2008, Mr Tappin owned a freight shipping company, Brooklands International.

US prosecutors accuse him of helping to buy five industrial batteries which were being shipped from America to Tehran.

He claims that he thought they were for use in the car industry, but the Americans say they were a key component of its Hawk Air Defence Missile which were being sold without government permission.

If he fights the case, he could spend two years in prison before he even takes a step in court.

Gary Mulgrew, one of the NatWest Three, who was released in 2010 after pleading guilty to wire fraud in the wake of the Enron scandal, says he fears for Mr Tappin.

‘He’s about to enter into the worst of all nightmares – my heart really bleeds for him.’

Mr Mulgrew served part of his time at the notorious Big Spring prison in Texas. ‘You are in a room with 80 inmates.

'When they lock the doors at 10pm, you are on your own until 7am. The guards aren’t protecting you. I am a 6ft 2in Scotsman – Christopher  Tappin is 65. It really is inhumane.’

Mr Tappin said: ‘I was relying on the British justice system to protect me from false allegations made by a  maverick government agency clearly operating outside the law in the US. 

'Our extradition laws completely fail to prevent such improper extraditions.’
