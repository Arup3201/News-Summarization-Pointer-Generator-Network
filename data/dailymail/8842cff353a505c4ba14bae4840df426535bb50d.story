A family has been left devastated after losing a second son to suicide in less than nine months.

Jonathan Watson, 28, known to friends as Jonny, was found dead at his home in the village of Stanmore, Hampshire, earlier this week.

His older brother Matthew, 29, also committed suicide in March after splitting with his girlfriend.

The brothers' grief-stricken parents 
John and Caryn Watson and their remaining children James, 26, Aaron, 37 
and Rachel, 36, now face their first Christmas without the pair.

The family is today being comforted by relatives and friends following Jonny's funeral as they try to come to terms with the double tragedy.

Caryn, 56, said the family was in 'complete shock' and said that Jonny was schizophrenic.

She said: 'It’s the total devastation of it all. We have had children 
everywhere for years and we would come home and think ‘I can’t cope with
all this'.'

'Now you don’t want to come home because there’s nothing here, it’s so quiet.'

'You
think ‘When are they coming home?’ or you lie awake at 3am and think 
‘They are going to ring up for a lift home soon’ but they don’t.'

Mrs Watson said her son had been diagnosed with schizophrenia a few years ago and had twice tried to kill himself last year.

Friends: The boys' mother Caryn Watson, 56, said Jonny had 'struggled' since his older brother committed suicide in March

She said Jonny had 'struggled' after his brother Matthew committed suicide eight months ago because the pair enjoyed a close relationship.

'We feel we have done our level best for Jonny but he got increasingly unable to cope. It all mounted up and up,' Mrs Watson added.

The boys' father John, 58, who works in the removals trade, said: 'James, the youngest, is devastated because he and his brothers Jonny and Matthew were very close and had the same group of friends.

'The three of them have always been together and wherever they were, they would keep in touch.

Jonny was previously admitted to the Melbury Lodge mental health unit near the family home but was returned home after a six-week stay.

The couple urged other people suffering from depression to talk to family and friends about their problems.

Mrs Watson said: 'We were always there for him but Jonny would not talk to people about things. It’s been so difficult to come to terms with. It’s so bad and it’s so tragic and it affects so many people’s lives.

'If anybody feels that desperately low or feels they’re stuck in a situation they need to talk about it. We’ve had five children and we’ve always tried to be open with them and we’ve always been there for all of them.'

She thanked friends and neighbors for their 'wonderful support', adding: 'John
went to the shop the other day and the woman behind the counter said 
Stanmore was in shock and it felt like the place had shut down since 
Jonny’s death.'

Mr Watson said Jonny, who loved fishing, was 'never happier' than when playing poker in nearby Winnall on Thursday nights, something Matthew also used to do with his father.

An inquest into Jonny’s death has been opened and adjourned to a later date by the local coroner. The inquest into Tesco stock controller Matthew’s suicide in March this year heard how his girlfriend Mandy Edmondson found his body at his home just hours after they had broken up.

In a letter to the family, Verity Eminton, who taught the children at Merdon junior school, wrote 'Jonathan was a dear little boy with an engaging smile and a twinkle in his eye'.

'As a teacher you always remember ‘your children’, and some more so, and Matthew and Jonathan are two of these.'

A spokesman for Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust, which runs Melbury Lodge, said: 'We can understand this is a difficult time for the family and wish to express our condolences for their loss. We are unable to make any public comment which reveals personal and medical details. However, we will ensure the family and carers are involved in any investigation into this case.'
