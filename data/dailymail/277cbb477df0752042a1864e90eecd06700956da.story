A rookie Los Angeles police officer wanted for murder was driven to Texas by his father after allegedly killing a man during a bar fight, a federal arrest warrant filed Thursday stated.

Henry Solis, 27, phoned his father Victor in Lancaster, asking him to come help after a fight that took place outside a bar in Pomoma last Friday left a 23-year-old dead from multiple gunshots.

Solis, who was considered a probationary officer, was off-duty when Salome Rodriguez was shot multiple times and killed after a fight in a downtown area filled with clubs and bars.

Wanted: Henry Solis, 27, phoned his father Victor in Lancaster, asking him to come help after a fight that took place outside a bar in Pomoma last Friday left a 23-year-old dead from multiple gunshots

The elder Solis was seen leaving his Lancaster home in a hurry after phone calls with his son, authorities said. 

He was then spotted Saturday in El Paso, Texas, with his pickup truck and dog at the home of family members who live there.

Solis was interviewed on Monday by FBI agents and told them he had driven his son across state lines Friday and dropped him at a bus stop in El Paso.

He said he didn't know the current location of his son, the document states. Police and prosecutors did not immediately say whether Victor Solis would face charges for helping his son.

Authorities spoke to family, friends and witnesses who told them that 'shortly after the murder, defendant Solis made incriminating statements about his role in the murder of Rodriguez and stated that he would never be seen again,' the warrant states.

Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck fired the probationary officer from the department on Tuesday. Beck urged Solis to turn himself in to authorities.
