Classic: Maya Angelou's autobiography is being taken off the syllabus by Welsh board WJEC

The British education minister has 
sparked anger after American classics have been dropped from high school reading 
lists in an attempt to put Britishness back into schools.

Michael
 Gove has outraged some readers and academics with the campaign, which 
has seen longtime American favorites including John Steinbeck's 'Of Mice
 and Men' and Harper Lee's 'To Kill a Mockingbird' dropped from the 
syllabus for a major high school qualification.

Maya Angelou’s autobiography, I
 Know Why The Caged Bird Sing, has also been culled by an exam board. 
The acclaimed author, poet and civil rights activist died on Wednesday 
aged 86.

Instead, the book
 lists for the English Literature GCSE, an exam taken by 16-year-olds 
after a two-year course of study, feature almost exclusively writers 
from Britain and Ireland.

Some educators fear that could lead to the narrowing of British minds.

'The
 idea of cutting out American books because they are not British is 
crazy,' said John Carey, a literary critic and emeritus professor at 
Oxford University.

Nobel Prize-winning writer Toni Morrison even waded into the debate, telling the Hay Festival that it was wrong 
to divide literature into 'nationalistic categories'. She said Mr Gove 
would regret the decision.

Exam
 boards in England and Wales - which set school syllabuses in line with 
government rules - have now finished releasing their new book lists for 
the English Literature GCSE.

Removed: Angelou's autobiography I Know Why The 
Caged Bird Sings (book pictured left) and Harper Lee's To Kill A 
Mockingbird (right) will no longer be studied by pupils as they are both
 'prose from different cultures'

Gone are Lee, Angelou, Steinbeck and 
Arthur Miller's play 'The Crucible'. Gone, too, are African and Asian 
writers including Haruki Murakami, Chinua Achebe and Chimamanda Ngozi 
Adiche.

Gove strongly denied that his goal was to banish non-British authors.

'I
 have not banned anything,' he wrote in the Daily Telegraph. 'All we are
 doing is asking exam boards to broaden - not narrow - the books young 
people study for GCSE.'

The 
education department says the guidelines represent the minimum students 
are required to learn, and that those who read more widely - and 
internationally - will do better on the exams.

'Everyone will have an opinion about which texts should be studied. We can't please everyone'

- Exam board spokesman

It
 also says pupils are required to study 'seminal world literature' - 
including American classics - between the ages of 11 and 14.

New GCSEs must include at least one 
play by Shakespeare, at least one nineteenth century novel, a selection 
of poetry since 1789 including representative Romantic poetry and 
‘fiction or drama from the British Isles from 1914 onwards’.  

A DfE spokesman: ‘The new 
GCSEs in English Literature will be broader and more challenging for 
pupils than those available at the moment. They will give pupils the 
chance to study some this country’s fantastic literary heritage, 
including works by Jane Austen, George Orwell, Kazuo Ishiguro and Meera 
Syal. 

Michael Gove has come under fire for the changes but insists exam boards have the freedom to choose texts

‘We have not banned 
any authors, books or genres. The exam boards have decided what 
literature to include, subject to the minimum requirements we set out. 
GCSE specifications are only a starting point.’

Mr Gove has also argued that all exam 
boards have the freedom to ‘include any number of other texts from which
 teachers can then choose’.

 American favorites including John Steinbeck's 'Of Mice
 and Men', Harper Lee's 'To Kill a Mockingbird', Maya Angelou’s autobiography, 'I
 Know Why The Caged Bird Sing' and Arthur Miller's play 'The Crucible' have been dropped from the syllabus.

African and Asian 
writers have also been dropped including Haruki Murakami, Chinua Achebe and Chimamanda Ngozi 
Adiche.

But
 an spokeswoman from one of the exam boards, AQA, said: ‘Whilst 
technically it would not be impossible to add additional texts beyond 
the essential requirements, to do so would place an unacceptable 
assessment burden on teachers and students, which we are clearly not 
prepared to do.’

Critics of the new English rules say they will have a restrictive, rather than broadening, effect.

'Michael
 Gove wants everybody studying traditional literature, and he wants it 
to be British,' said Bethan Marshall, chair of the National Association 
for the Teaching of English. 'I think that's a bit of a mistake.'

Paul
 Dodd, OCR's head of GCSE and A-level reform, has personally blamed Mr 
Gove for the 'restrictions', saying that the Education Secretary 'really
 dislikes' Of Mice And Men.

One
 board, OCR, proposed new content features Meera Syal’s Anita and Me; 
Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never Let Me Go; George Orwell’s Animal Farm, Dennis 
Kelly’s DNA and J.B.Priestley’s An Inspector Calls.

AQA
 lists these texts as well as Stephen Kelman’s Pigeon English; William 
Golding’s Lord of the Flies and AQA Anthology, Telling Tales, under 
modern prose.

In modern 
drama, pupils will be able to study Alan Bennett’s The History Boys; 
Willy Russell’s Blood Brothers; Shelagh Delaney’s A Taste of Honey and 
Simon Stephens’ The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time 
(script).

Under the ‘19th 
century novel’ teenagers will study texts including Robert Louis 
Stevenson’s The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Sir Arthur 
Conan Doyle’s The Sign of Four.

The
 AQA poetry selection has a strong emphasis on British and Irish 
writers. It includes Byron, Shelley, Tennyson, Seamus Heaney, Thomas 
Hardy and Ted Hughes.

AQA’s 
chief executive, Andrew Hall, said yesterday: ‘We know that everyone 
will have an opinion about which texts should be studied and that we 
can’t please everyone.'

More than 55,000 people have signed a petition against the English Literature GCSE reforms.
