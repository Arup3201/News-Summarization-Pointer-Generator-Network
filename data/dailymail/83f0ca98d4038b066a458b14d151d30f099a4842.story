Researchers  have developed the first genetic strain of mice that can be infected with Ebola and display symptoms similar to those that humans experience.

The breakthrough could significantly speed up the development of vaccines for the killer virus, researchers say.

Until now, researchers have struggled to test vaccines effectively. 

Researchers were able to breed together eight genetic mouse variants and successfully test a strain of mice to permit active research on potential Ebola vaccines and treatments.

Typical laboratory mice usually do not develop human-like Ebola disease, including the severe symptoms that can prove fatal in humans.

This model system more accurately reflected the human experience when infected with the virus.

The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, work, published in the current issue of Science, will significantly improve basic research on Ebola treatments and vaccines, which are desperately needed to curb the worldwide public health and economic toll of the disease.

'You can't look for a cure for Ebola unless you have an animal model that mimics the Ebola virus disease spectra,' said study co-author Ralph Baric, professor of epidemiology at the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health and UNC School of Medicine.

'For the first time, we were able to produce a novel platform for rapidly developing new mouse models that replicate human disease for this virus, as well as other important emerging human pathogens.'

Typical laboratory mice usually do not develop human-like Ebola disease, including the severe symptoms that can prove fatal in humans. 

So the researchers asked whether all mice are immune to Ebola, or whether some strains of mice are susceptible; and if some are susceptible, could they harness the power of mouse genetics to figure out what genes make someone susceptible to the disease.

To find out, the team, including researchers from the University of Washington and the NIH Rocky Mountain National Laboratory, where the research took place, were able to breed together eight genetic mouse variants and successfully test a strain of mice to permit active research on potential Ebola vaccines and treatments. 

This model system more accurately reflected the human experience when infected with the virus.

The team was able to show that a combination of genes were involved in producing a range of disease symptoms, such that the genetic variation of the mice directly led to the variety of symptoms that the disease produced. 

What's more, the researchers pinpointed a single gene that accounted for much of that variation – a gene responsible for encoding a protein known as TEK.

William Fischer II, MD, an assistant professor of medicine who has treated Ebola patients in Africa, said, 'A basic understanding of how our genetics influence susceptibility to viral infections and affect disease development is absolutely critical to creating much needed therapeutic interventions.'

Fischer, who was not part of this research project, added, 'We can decrease Ebola fatality rates with intensive critical care but this is difficult to do in places with limited human and material resources. 

'Rationally designed treatments and vaccines are desperately needed.'
