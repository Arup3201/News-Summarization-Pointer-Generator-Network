French troops today launched their first ground operation against Islamist rebels in Mali in a crucial action to dislodge al Qaeda-linked fighters who have resisted six days of air strikes.

France called for international support against Islamist insurgents it says are a threat to Africa and the West and acknowledged it faced a long fight against well-equipped and determined militant fighters who seized Mali's vast desert north last year.

After Islamist threats to exact revenge for France's dramatic intervention, an al Qaeda-linked group claimed responsibility for a raid on a gas field in Algeria in which seven foreigners were kidnapped and a French national killed.

Earlier, Edouard Guillaud, the French chief of 
military staff, said up to 2,500 of his troops would soon have been 
deployed, together with tanks and artillery pieces.

It comes as British transport planes 
which have landed in the west African country continue to resupply the 
growing military presence in the west African country.

The force includes a cavalry detachment of the Foreign Legion from the southern town of Orange, as well as special forces.

'We're now on the ground,' said Admiral Guillaud. 'We will be in direct combat within hours.'

They will be leaving the relative 
safety of the Malian capital of Bamako and heading towards rebel 
strongholds in the north of the country.

All have been hit during five days of constant bombing by the French airforce, although they remain a formidable fighting force.

Last Friday – when the campaign 
started – President Francois Hollande indicated that only planes would 
be deployed, and that the attacks would end 'within weeks'.

But the advance of French ground 
troops is a clear sign of an escalation which will increase fears that 
Mali will turn into another Afghanistan or Iraq.

British military commanders have 
already warned Prime Minister David Cameron against stepping up support 
for the French in their former colony.

Two RAF transport planes have already 
been diverted from Afghanistan to carry equipment to Mali, and there are
 fears that Mr Cameron could eventually sanction British soldiers 
intervening.

But Africa minister Mark Simmonds told
 Parliament on Monday night that Mr Cameron had insisted 'there will be 
no combat troops from the UK involved and we have no plans to provide 
more military assistance.'

More than 10 countries including 
Britain have offered support to the Mali mission, but so far only France
 has soldiers on the ground.

Mr Hollande insists that the intervention was necessary to prevent Mali turning into a Islamist terrorist base.
