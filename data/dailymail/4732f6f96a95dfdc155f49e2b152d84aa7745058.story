Ruling: Immigration Judge Jonathan Perkins, pictured, said Ali can stay in Britain

A Sudanese asylum seeker who raped a 12-year-old girl has been allowed to remain in Britain – after a judge ruled it would breach his human rights to deport him.

Sani Adil Ali was jailed for raping the girl just months after he was given refugee status.

When he was sentenced, another judge described him as ‘a potential danger to young girls’ and put him on the Sex Offenders’ Register for the rest of his life.

But after serving a three-year 
sentence, an immigration tribunal ruled Ali could stay in Britain on the
 grounds that he could be in danger if he returned to Sudan.

Senior
 immigration judge Jonathan Perkins allowed the 28-year-old to remain in
 Britain, even though the rapist’s probation officers found that he 
presented some risk to young people.

In
 his ruling, Judge Perkins said: ‘We find that the appellant is still 
entitled to the protection of the Refugee Convention and the 
Qualification Directive.

'In any event, removing him would be contrary to
 the United Kingdom’s obligations under the European Convention on Human
 Rights.’

It is not the 
first time that Judge Perkins has made a controversial decision. Last 
month, The Mail on Sunday reported how he allowed an Afghan Muslim, who 
claimed he killed people while fighting for the Taliban, to remain in 
Britain.

It has also been 
reported that Judge Perkins has often allowed foreign criminals to 
remain in Britain because of their ‘right to a family life’ under the 
Human Rights Act.

His latest decision is another setback for Home Secretary Theresa May, whose plans to crack down on the
 way foreign criminals use human rights to avoid being deported appear 
to be repeatedly undermined by the courts.

Charlie
 Elphicke, Conservative MP for Dover & Deal, who has tabled a Bill 
to replace the Human Rights Act with a British Bill of Rights, said: 
‘Britain will always be there to provide refuge to those in need. But 
people who commit crimes here should be sent back immediately.

‘Right-thinking people in Britain will be appalled that this person will be allowed to stay here. It sums up what is wrong with the European human rights laws.

‘We should have zero tolerance of refugees who commit crimes. Cases like this are why I have tabled a British Bill of Rights so we can control our borders and ensure that foreign criminals and terrorists are deported immediately.’

Ali had attacked the 12-year-old girl while he was staying with her family during a five-day trip to Sheffield

Ali, who is from the Darfur region, arrived in Britain in October 2003 and was awarded refugee status in February 2005.

But two months later he was arrested at his address in Middlesbrough over the rape of a 12-year-old  Hungarian girl.

Ali had attacked her while staying with her family during a five-day trip to Sheffield. The victim’s family had offered to put him up while he visited his friend, Kamel Ahmed, then 22, also from Darfur.

Ali and Ahmed knew each other and the girl’s family from refugee camps in Italy and France.

Ali, who pleaded guilty to one count of child rape, was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment at Sheffield Crown Court. Ahmed was convicted of three counts of child rape and jailed for ten years.

Michael Joseph QC, pictured, said he regarded Ali as a 'potential danger to young girls' when sentencing him for the rape of a 12-year-old

Judge Michael Murphy QC, said: ‘I regard each of you as a potential danger to young girls and so each of you will be banned for the rest of your life from ever taking up a job which involves working with children under 16.’

When Ali was released from Doncaster jail in 2008, the Home Office ordered that he return to Sudan and he was locked up in an immigration removal centre.

Ali appealed to the immigration court and when a judge rejected his bid, he mounted a fresh appeal to the Upper Tribunal Immigration and Asylum Chamber.

At the Sheffield hearing, Judge Perkins ruled that removing Ali, who comes from the Zaghawa tribe, would breach his rights under Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits torture or inhumane punishment.

Judge Perkins referred to a 2009 ruling which stated that non-Arab tribes such as the Zaghawa are ‘at risk of persecution in Darfur and cannot reasonably be expected to relocate elsewhere in Sudan’.

The judge also said Ali could not be deported because he was not a danger to the public, and therefore could not have his refugee status taken away from him.

He said that even though his probation officers found he ‘presented some risk to young people’, Ali had ‘faced up to his responsibilities and indicated an intention to behave himself in the future’.

It is believed Ali was allowed to leave the immigration removal centre around 2009 and then moved to Newcastle, and still lives in the North East. It is not known if he received legal aid to fund his immigration fight.

Last night the Government admitted it was powerless in the face of the tribunal’s decision, with an aide to Mrs May stressing there was nothing the Home Secretary could do. ‘We are at the mercy of the courts,’ they said.

The UK Border Agency said: ‘We do not believe this individual needs or deserves refuge in this country.’
