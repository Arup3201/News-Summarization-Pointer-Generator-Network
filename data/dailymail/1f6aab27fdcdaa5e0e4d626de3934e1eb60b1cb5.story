The 32-year-old said: ‘I could still see. I still had my hands. I wanted to fight. I’m disappointed. It wasn’t the way I wanted that fight to end. I wish my ear hadn’t done that. Man, that ear was a bummer.’

She explained that she had been draining the cauliflower ear every night and said that it now looked ‘pretty gnarly’.

Her opponent told Eurosport: ‘When I connected and saw her ear blow up, that became my main target. I was going to keep hitting it until they stopped the fight or it fell off.’
