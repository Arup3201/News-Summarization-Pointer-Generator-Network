Anderlecht manager Besnik Hasi believes Arsenal were worried about entertaining their fans rather than seeing the game out after throwing away a three-goal lead against the Belgian side.

The Gunners left the Emirates with just a point when Anderlecht fought back from 3-0 down in the second-half to draw 3-3, a result which means Arsene Wenger's side are not yet guaranteed to reach the knockout stages of the Champions League.

Hasi, who did not shake hands with Wenger at full-time, claims the Premier League side went in search of more goals in a bid to please supporters and paid for it,

'Arsenal tried to play the same way,' he told The Daily Telegraph. 'They didn't just sit back. They tried to score a fourth and, at 3-2, they started to have doubts. We could see a difference from the mental perspective. I think we deserved the 3-3.

'Maybe Arsenal thought they were on top and they could get more goals and they could have fun in front of the public. At 3-0, you can say it's over and they wanted the fourth and the fifth goal but we made some changes.'

With the north London side having failed to keep a clean sheet in the competition so far this season, Hasi insists that he always felt Arsenal's defence would be vulnerable.

He said: 'Yes but to expose them, you have to have confidence. At 3-1, yes, we used the spaces that they gave us. 

'We have some young, fast players and if they have confidence, they can go. At 3-2, you saw Arsenal were doubting. We also changed our scheme with the second striker. Yes, Arsenal doubted and we were growing.

'The last 30 minutes were as intense as when we won the championship [last season]. I am a young coach but this will stay in my memory. We come from a small competition but we showed we can match these teams. Over the two games against Arsenal, we deserve more than one point.'
