China has taken a major step towards achieving its ambition of becoming a leading naval power after successfully landing a fighter jet on an aircraft carrier for the first time.

The People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy landed a J-15 fighter jet - capable of carrying missiles and precision-guided bombs - on its Liaoning aircraft carrier while the ship was out at sea.

The carrier, which is China's first, officially entered service two months ago, but it is not expected to carry a full complement of planes or be ready for combat for some time.

China's state news agency released pictures of the fighter touching down on the Liaoning ship. The carrier is regarded as symbolic of the country's bid to become a leading Asian naval power.

Xinhua said the landing exercise marked the debut outing of the domestically developed J-15, which is said to have capabilities to match those of Russia's Sukhoi Su-33 carrier-based defence fighter, as well as the U.S. F-15 fighter jet.

It is able to carry anti-ship, air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles and precision-guided bombs.

Liaoning: Since the carrier officially entered service in September, crew members have completed more than 100 tests and training exercises

The carrier platform and J-15 capabilities met all requirements and achieved 'good compatibility', the news agency said.

Since China's Liaoning ship formally entered into service on September 25, its crew members have completed over 100 training and test programs.

China spent ten years refurbishing the carrier after buying the unfinished former Soviet navy ship from the Ukraine in 1998.
