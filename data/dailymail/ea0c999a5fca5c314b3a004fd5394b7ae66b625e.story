A sea of foam has covered a coastal town in a white blanket of bubbles whipped up by huge waves.

As scattered wind, rain and floods hit the rest of the country, the seaside town of Cleveleys, in Lancashire, has been overtaken by the snow-like covering.

It comes as Met Office forecasters predict an unsettled week of sunshine and showers as the remnants of Hurricane Bertha head north, for Scotland. 

The combination of one of the month's highest tides, along with high winds, meant that for around an hour gallons of foam was blown in shore.

The blizzard-like effect actually drew many hundreds of onlookers, as well as people wanting to drive through the foam.

Gusts of wind up to 50mph and a high tide coincided and caused unusual weather conditions along the Fylde Coast in Lancashire, covering it in a snow-like blanket

Forecast: The Met Office has warned of an unsettled picture for the rest of the week and into the weekend - with a brief respite of sunshine on Thursday

David Hewitt. who photographed the images, said: 'It only happens once or twice a year and on this occasion there was a lot more foam than usual.

'Lots of people arrived to drive through it, but goodness knows what the foam would do to their engines.'

The Met Office has warned of an unsettled picture for the rest of the week and into the weekend - with a brief respite of sunshine on Thursday.

Temperatures will be in the early 20s today - but winds and heavy showers sweeping across the Midlands will make it feel much cooler, a spokesman said.

He added: 'Wednesday will be a drier day. There will still be a few showers, but it will perhaps feel a touch warmer, with a west and south west air flow.

'There will be top temperatures of 23C in London tomorrow, and also a drier day in Scotland.

'By Thursday most places will see quite a decent day, with dry spells. But in the southwest it will be quite a wet day throughout the day.

'By Friday, again, not too bad a day. Some showers in the east, drier in the west - a mixed day of sunshine and showers.

'Saturday
 looks mainly dry with light rain showers, but very few and far between.
 But Sunday will be a bit more unsettled and very blustery in places.'

The
 recent storms have led to a glut in hedgerow fruits, particularly 
sloes, which have already started appearing in abundance ahead of the 
Autumn.

The soaking has ‘tricked’ blackthorn trees into thinking the autumn has already arrived.

As a result they have begun hurriedly producing fruits before the first frosts arrive.

Sloes
 are prized by foragers, who mix them with gin and sugar and leave the 
infusion for several months to create a sweet liqueur.

Experts are
 now heralding a vintage year for foraging with other hedgerow fruits 
like blackberries, haws and rosehips also enjoying bumper crops.

John
 Wright, a foraging expert and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall’s right-hand 
man, said: 'The first sloes are out about four weeks early this year.

'Nature tends to follow the weather rather than by the calendar and that’s exactly what has happened here.

'We had a mild winter followed by a hot and dry summer but recently we’ve had a bit of rain and a dip in temperatures.

'Blackthorn
 trees have been tricked into thinking it is autumn and that frosts are 
on their way so they have started producing sloes already.

'The rain gave the trees a boost and fired them into production mode.

'We tend to think of sloes being an autumn thing and some people wait until after the first frosts in November to pick them.

'But this year we’ll be able to get a head start.

'It is looking like it is going to be a bumper year for sloes and other hedgerow fruits like haws and rosehips so foragers will be very happy.'

Blackthorn trees - Prunus spinosa in Latin - are often used to form hedges because of their prickly thorns.

They flower in spring and sloe berries usually start to emerge around mid-September.

Sloes are members of the same family as plums, cherries and peaches.
