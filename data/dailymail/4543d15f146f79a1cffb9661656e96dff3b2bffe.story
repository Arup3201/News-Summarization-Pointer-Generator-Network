A low-budget film starring Loose Women panellist Andrea McLean and former EastEnders star Marc Bannerman was only made to cover up a £2.5million tax scam, a court has heard.

Bashar Al-Issa, 34, is alleged to have faked VAT receipts and film tax credits for a £19.6million gangster film called A Landscape of Lives that was never made.

However, after the taxman caught up with the fraud in 2011, the former property developer and his co-conspirators cobbled together a low budget film called A Landscape of Lies to make the claims seem legitimate, it was said.

The film was allegedly made on a 'shoestring' of £100,000 or less and starred Ms McLean as troubled bisexual therapist Dr Audrey Grey. 

Its IMDB listing also reveals that it starred former EastEnders actor Marc Bannerman.

Al-Issa and co-defendants Tariq Hassan, 52, Ian Sherwood, 54, and Osama Albaghdady, 51, are accused of conspiracy to cheat the revenue between April 2010 and April 2011.

They are accused of successfully claiming almost £800,000 in forged VAT receipts. 

They are also alleged to have tried to claim another £591,000, which was refused.

During the second application for VAT repayments Hassan even claimed that A Landscape of Lives had backing in the form of a £19.6m loan, it was said.

A further claim for £256,000 in film tax credits was also approved in March 2011, but a larger claim for more than £1m being handled by accountants Deloitte was rejected after the alleged fraudsters were arrested, jurors were told.

The film is listed on IMDb as starring Andrea McLean and Marc Bannerman but none of the actors are involved in the alleged fraud

There is no suggestion that the actors in the film, including Andrea McLean, had any part in the alleged fraud.

Opening the case at Southwark Crown Court, prosecutor Shane Collery told jurors: 'The film that was proposed to be made at that time was called A Landscape of Lives.

'It was a gangster film set in London. A Landscape of Lives was not made. A much rewritten and remade film called A Landscape of Lies was ultimately made in the beginning of June 2011.'

Mr Collery continued: 'The impetus was probably that these defendants had been arrested in April 2011 and they needed to show they were going to make something.

'It was a very different film from that proposed to obtain government approval. A Landscape of Lives was a film said to have a budget of £19.6m.

'For A Landscape of Lies the budget was about £100,000. It was a much smaller budget. There were issues even about that.

'The film may have cost in the region of £84,000. A series of companies were set up to take part in this entire process. They were each involved in the production.'

He said that initial claims of a film being made, in relation of A Landscape of Lives, were ‘a fiction intended to deceive’.

Jurors heard how a company called Evolved Pictures Limited was initially in charge of A Landscape of Lives.

It has been alleged that Marc Bannerman (far left) who appeared in EastEnders, starred in a film which was only made to cover up a tax scam although there is is no suggestion he knew about the alleged fraud

Evolved in turn subcontracted the work to another company called AB Production Limited, said to have been run by Albaghdady.

AB was then claimed to have subcontracted work to a third company called A-Z Consortium Unlimited, apparently run by a Jordanian man but which was in fact allegedly under the control of Al-Issa, who was declared bankrupt in March 2009.

Co-conspirator Tariq Hassan, who was Al-Issa’s lecturer at the University of East London is said to have acted as bookkeeper.

Sherwood, an architect, and engineer AlBaghdady, who Al-Issa knew from his property developing days in Manchester, are also accused of the same charge.

The court heard how neither had any previous experience of working in the film industry.Explaining the alleged fraud further, Mr Collery said: 'Three production companies were set up as producers for the film.

'They had various links between them. On a commercial basis there was no reason for all three to exist. If you are making one film you do not need three production companies.'

Referring to the allegedly fake VAT invoices submitted, Mr Collery continued: 'The Crown say that little at all was in fact supplied and that the invoices present a false picture.

'The whole purpose was to steal money from the public purse.'

Iraqi-born Al-Issa, of Maida Vale, and Hassan of Loughton, Sherwood, 54, of Sale in Cheshire and Albaghdady, 51, of Crumpstall in Manchester all deny two counts of conspiracy to cheat the revenue between April 2010 and April 2011.

The trial continues.
