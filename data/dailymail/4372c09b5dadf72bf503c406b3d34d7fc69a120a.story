Militants fighting for the Islamic State have released horrific images of an alleged thief having his hand hacked off in its latest warped display of justice.

The photographs show two masked 'surgeons' unpacking a briefcase containing meat cleavers, bandages and a chopping board  in front of a baying crowd of onlookers.

A suspect,  reportedly convicted of stealing a motorbike after a 'trial' at an Islamic State court, is then frogmarched to a table where his right hand is doused in some form of sterilizing fluid.

His hand is then held down on a chopping board while a militant lops it off with a cleaver.

Before the sentencing, the images show crowds of onlookers, including young children, surrounding the table while a fighter appears to read out the charges.

It is latest in a string of sickening amputations carried out by ISIS in Iraq and Syria in recent weeks.

The photographs, like previous one, were shared by pro-ISIS social media users, who use the Arabic file sharing website Nasher to exchange images of the terror group's latest atrocities.

The images are high quality  and carry the distinctive yellow branding of the group's Al-Hayat Media Center, suggesting they may be stills from an as-yet unreleased propaganda video. 

It comes just days after photographs taken in the ISIS stronghold of Mosul showed in gruesome detail how the terrorists pump their victims full of drugs before using a massive meat cleaver to cut off the hands.  

Last month, Islamic State released a document on social media, explaining the rules of Islamic State penal code, which is being brutally enforced across ISIS-held territory in Syria and Iraq. 

Entitled 'Clarification [regarding] the Hudud', the document contains a list of the punishments handed out for crimes committed in the Islamic State, in accordance with the extremist group's radical interpretation of Shariah law. 

All punishments are carried out after a 'trial' at an Islamic State court. After the sentencing, the prisoner is taken into the centre of the town or city.

Iron rule: Heavily armed militants monitor the crowds which include children as young a five years old

Men and young boys of all ages are actively encouraged to gather and watch the punishments.

An Islamic State fighter then reads out the charges found against the victim before the punishment is carried out in public.   

All forms of blasphemy against Islam are punished by execution, even if the accuser chooses to repent of their sins. 

Likewise, committing murder, spying, apostasy or sodomy is punished by immediate death.

Anyone found guilty of banditry, specifically murder and stealing, is put to death by crucifixion.

According to Islamic State's reading of Shariah law, thieves have a hand cut off. It is unclear whether the victim can choose which hand is removed.

Islamic State's penal code also states that anyone found guilty of banditry and caught stealing will have their right hand and their left leg amputated. This terrible punishment is done so that every member of the public can identify the victim's past crime.

Flogging is another common punishment carried out under Islamic State.    

Getting ready: In a previous amputation, the men's arms are pumped full of drugs and wrapped in tight bandages both to lessen the agony  and to reduce the amount of blood flowing from the open wound

Agony: After having his hand hacked off, the victim is seen receiving medical treatment to ensure the wound does not become infected

Sick: The victim is seen pinned in a chair by a group of men, one of whom uses a chord to pull his arm taut while two others place a heavy meat cleaver on the top of his wrist, ready to strike
