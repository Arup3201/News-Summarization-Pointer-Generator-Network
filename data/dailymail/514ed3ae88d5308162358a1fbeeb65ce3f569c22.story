Commons Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans has withdrawn from this week’s Queen’s Speech debates as he fights what he yesterday described as ‘completely false’ rape claims.

The senior Tory spoke of his ‘incredulity’ after being arrested over allegations by two men he had until then ‘regarded as friends’.

Mr Evans, 55, who came out as gay in 2010 after years of gossip, said he had just endured ‘the worst 24 hours of my life’.

After being released on bail, he vehemently denied the accusations, revealing that the men knew each other and that he had ‘continued to socialise with one as recently as last week’.

Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans was spoken to about 'inappropriate sexual behaviour' four years ago, according to reports

Mr Evans, Conservative MP for Ribble Valley, today said that he had considered the two men who made the recent allegations against him to be 'friends'

Mr Evans had what appeared to be a gash on his forehead which aides asked a television make-up artist to try to conceal before he made his statement. The injury was not evident in pictures taken of him on Thursday night when he was out in Soho with former Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik.

News of Saturday’s arrest at the constituency home of the popular MP for the Ribble Valley in Lancashire came as a huge shock to colleagues at Westminster, many of whom spoke out in his support.

Mr Evans has insisted he would not be stepping down from his high-profile position as one of John Bercow’s deputies or as an MP. However, after Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said it would be difficult for him to continue in such a ‘sensitive’ role while police continue to investigate the allegations, it emerged that he had asked to be excused from his ceremonial duties following Wednesday’s State Opening of Parliament.

Instead of Mr Evans chairing any Commons debates on the Queen’s Speech in the absence of Mr Bercow, that role will be performed by his fellow deputies, Dawn Primarolo and Lindsay Hoyle, Commons sources said last night. The decision means Mr Evans is unlikely to take the Speaker’s chair for at least a fortnight – giving all sides time to consider whether he can continue to carry out his duties while under police investigation.

It was on Saturday morning that Mr Evans was arrested at his home in the idyllic village of Pendleton, near Clitheroe. He has owned the £250,000 two-bedroom terrace cottage – which has a small House of Commons portcullis on its wooden nameplate – for 15 years.

Lancashire police – who did not name him to the media – said they were investigating allegations that he raped one man and sexually assaulted another, both in their 20s, in Pendleton between 2009 and March this year.

Officers spent the day searching his London and Lancashire homes as well as his car, a white Saab convertible parked in the village. He was released on bail on Saturday night, shortly afterwards saying on Facebook: ‘Thanks for the amazing overwhelming support at this difficult time.’

Yesterday he issued a strongly worded statement in the beer garden of the Camra award-winning Swan With Two Necks pub next to his home.

‘Yesterday I was interviewed by the police concerning complaints made by two people who are well known to each other and who until yesterday I regarded as friends,’ he said.

'Incredulity': Mr Evans said he could not understand why the 'completely false' accusations had been made

Support: The Deputy House speaker Nigel Evans thanked his colleagues, friends and members of the public for their support

Denial: Mr Evans said the allegations against him were 'completely false'

‘The allegations are completely  false and I can’t understand why they have been made, especially as I have continued to socialise with one as recently as last week.

‘I appreciate the way the police have handled this in such a sensitive manner, and I’d like to thank my colleagues, friends and members of the public who have expressed their support and – like me – a sense of incredulity at these events.’

A few minutes earlier a TV crew worker had applied make-up to his forehead in an attempt to conceal what appeared to be a large blue-tinged cut.

Mr Evans – said to be ‘very shaken up’ by his arrest – refused to answer questions except answering ‘ok’ when asked how he felt.

After a lunchtime drink at the pub, Mr Evans said that ‘notwithstanding the death of my mum, and the loss of my brother very recently’, he had endured ‘the worst 24 hours of my life’. In 2009 the Daily Mail told how the MP had spoken of ‘shocking’ failures at Singleton Hospital in Swansea following the death of his 86-year-old mother from the superbug C.diff.

Mr Evans said yesterday he had been ‘bolstered’ by the ‘amazing, overwhelming support’ he had received, both from residents of his ‘biscuit-tin-picture-like village’ but also ‘phenomenal’ backing on Facebook.

In addition to online support, Mr Evans was backed by family, neighbours and political colleagues. His 49-year-old sister, Louise Collins, who took over their father’s newsagent’s business in Swansea after his death, said: ‘The family love him to death and we’re 100 per cent behind him.’

His local Conservative Association released a statement saying: ‘In our democracy everyone accused is innocent until proven guilty and therefore unless Nigel chooses himself to cease to be our MP or the electorate vote him out or justice system intervenes, we expect him to continue as normal to fulfil his duties in representing the people of the Ribble Valley.’

Brian Binley, Tory MP for Northampton South and a friend of Mr Evans, said he had been ‘deeply disturbed and shocked’ at his arrest. ‘I know him to be caring, compassionate, and in no way would he inflict himself violently on any other person,’ he said.

Leicestershire Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, who was accused of a sex assault two years ago only for police to drop their inquiries six days later, also said Mr Evans should continue.

Earlier, however, Mr Hammond told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show that while he stuck ‘rigidly’ to the principle of innocent until proven guilty, ‘it is quite difficult to carry out a sensitive and high-profile role while being under this kind of scrutiny’.

Tory sources stressed that, as Deputy Speaker, Mr Evans does not technically take the Conservative whip, so the question of it being withdrawn does not arise.

The high-profile arrest will fuel the debate over whether anonymity should be granted to those suspected but not charged over sex offences. Former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Lord Blair told Sky News that while it was ‘a real problem, I think the names have to be given’.
