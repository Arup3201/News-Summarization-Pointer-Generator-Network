A celebrity minder assaulted by police in a convenience store with comedian Noel Fielding won more than £100,000 in compensation yesterday.

A judge found that Jimmy Browne’s leg was crushed in an unlawful attempted arrest.

Judge Rosalind Coe, QC, said two policemen recognised Fielding, who was dressed in a gaudy stage costume, as the star of the surreal BBC comedy show The Mighty Boosh.

Mr Fielding (left) was dressed in gold boots and a boiler suit when he and his friend, James Browne (right outside the High Court in October), were stopped by officers outside a convenience store in north London

They targeted him and convicted killer Browne because they believed they might be carrying drugs. Browne, who did not work for Fielding, was found to have a small amount of cocaine, but no charges were brought.

The minder – who was once jailed for 18 years for manslaughter during a robbery, and admits taking drugs in the past – used to be fit but now has a limp and cannot run due to his injuries.

The ‘close protection security guard’, who worked for the late singer Amy Winehouse, was awarded £108,491 in aggravated damages for his ‘handicap on the labour market’ and what was called the high-handed and oppressive manner of police.

He was found to have cocaine and methedrone, a stimulant that was not illegal at the time of the assault in April 2010 at the Everbest store in Kentish Town, North London.

Judge Coe said the officers, named as PC O’Leary and PC Tucker, saw the pair on the street at 10.30am on Easter Sunday. They were ‘the last men standing’ after an all-night party.

Mr Fielding (right, with Mighty Boosh co-star Julian Barratt) and Mr Browne were stopped by police as they made their way home from an all-night party. The comedian admitted that he was drunk and hadn't slept

The officers ‘were immediately aware of Mr Fielding’s celebrity status’, she said, and knew the area as a ‘drugs hotspot’.

Fielding was wearing his stage outfit from a show the night before, including dungarees, gold boots, a ladies’ checked jacket, and dyed blond hair.

The judge said that while Browne, 54, was not Fielding’s minder, his job meant he ‘was in the habit of looking out for people such as Fielding who might be the subject of unwelcome attention’. The men were ‘well known to one another’.

After the party, Browne had been asked to clear up drugs paraphernalia. He had picked up eight papers of ‘what he knew to be likely to be drugs or traces thereof’, planning ‘to dispose of them outside’, Judge Coe said.

PC O’Leary claimed he shouted to Browne to stop. He said Browne struggled and tried to conceal something in his hand, so he put him in an arm lock and carried him out of the shop.

Mr Fielding (pictured in the Mighty Boosh) said he was aware of a struggle between Mr Browne and the officers, but he did not see any violence, London's High Court heard

Mr Browne was previously a very fit man whose hobbies included fencing, skydiving and running, London's High Court (pictured) heard. But he was left with a leg injury and now sometimes has to use a wheelchair

But Browne claimed he was attacked from behind without warning. The judge said neither was ‘entirely honest’, but the officer deliberately exaggerated. He was ‘not telling the truth’ and showed ‘deliberate dishonesty’ in his account of what happened when an ambulance arrived.

Browne’s leg was smashed and he spent a month in hospital. His leg became infected, and he later suffered another broken leg and a broken arm when he fell badly during recovery.

The judge found Fielding, who was ‘an honest and straightforward witness’ was ‘unnecessarily restrained’ by being ‘manhandled to the floor and handcuffed without being told why’.

She said Browne’s previous convictions were ‘of very limited relevance’, but added he had no tax returns or bank accounts and ‘seems to have no work history’.

CCTV footage from the store – which the High Court judge said was ‘likely to be of the utmost importance’ – was damaged beyond use as it was transported between the offices of the Metropolitan Police’s solicitors.
