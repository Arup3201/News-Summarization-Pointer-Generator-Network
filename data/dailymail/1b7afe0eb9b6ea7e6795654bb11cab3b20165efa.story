Casey Anthony’s father today denied accusations that he had an affair with one of the volunteers who helped to search for his missing grand-daughter.

Crystal Holloway, 39, has told investigators that George Anthony visited her apartment for romantic trysts in 2008 and confessed to her that his two-year-old grand-daughter Caylee had died as a result of 'an accident that snowballed out of control'.

Mr Anthony denied the allegations as 'very funny' during sworn testimony in court in Orlando, Florida - where his daughter is on trial for Caylee’s 2008 murder - telling jurors that Ms Holloway was a woman with a 'questionable past' who he befriended out of compassion after she told him that she had a brain tumour.

The two first met in October 2008 when Ms Holloway, who also goes by the name of River Cruz, came to a command centre set up by Mr Anthony and his wife Cindy in collaboration with Texas Equusearch, an organisation that coordinates hunts for missing people.

Mr Anthony said that he 'sometimes maybe considered her a friend or someone who was going to be helping find our grand-daughter' and that he visited her at her home two or three times, with his wife’s knowledge.

'The very first time, I was in there because we had a conversation in which she relayed to me probably weeks or just a few days prior…that she has a brain tumour, she was dying, she needed someone to comfort her.'

Being 'a good guy', he had offered her his support, he said.

He also said he never told Holloway that he grabbed Casey by the throat, threw her against a wall and demanded Casey tell him where Caylee was.

'I felt that she was so giving of 
herself, to me and my family, to help look for our grand-daughter, it 
was the least I could do to go in and show some compassion and respect,'
 he testified.

'To
 say that I had said something to her… that something might have 
"snowballed out of control", that was never there,' he insisted, 
admitting that he may have sent Ms Holloway text messages saying that he
 needed her in his life, but adding that many volunteers became like 
family.

'I sent text messages to many, many volunteers…and yes, I did need those people in my life,' he said. 'I have nothing to hide.'

Speaking calmly but firmly, he denied suggestions by defence lawyer Cheney Mason that he had been 'intimate' with the volunteer.

On the stand: Casey Anthony's mother Cindy Mrs Anthony denied in court today that she had dispatched the private investigators to search the wooded area where her grand-daughter's body was found

Testimony: Casey's brother Lee Anthony said he argued with his mother after Caylee's disappearance about sending investigators into the woods

'I never had a romantic affair with 
Crystal Holloway, River Cruz or whatever names she ever wanted to give 
you or the world. If I’m not mistaken, sir, she has a questionable past,
 OK? She also had been arrested for fraud, breaking and entering, and 
things like that. She’s not a good person, sir,' he said.

Caylee’s
 remains were found in swampy woodland near the Anthony family’s home in
 December 2008. Five months previously, her grandmother had reported her
 missing after growing suspicious about the little girl’s month-long 
absence and Anthony’s repeated claims that the child was simply away 
staying with a nanny.

After
 being challenged about her story by her mother and sheriff’s deputies, 
Anthony changed her story, claiming that Caylee had been kidnapped by 
the nanny.

When her trial opened five weeks ago, her lawyer admitted that the nanny was one of several 'imaginary friends' Anthony had invented, and set out a new version of events: Caylee drowned accidentally in the family pool on June 16, 2008 and was fished out by her grandfather, who disposed of the body secretly and told his daughter never to reveal what had happened.

Anthony claims that she complied 
because she had been conditioned to obey and lie for her father as a 
result of him sexually abusing her as a child. Mr Anthony denies the 
accusations.

Anthony’s 
defence team is arguing that Caylee’s remains were only dumped in the 
area a short while before they were found in December 2008, calling 
several witnesses to try to back their claim.

But several proved of more
 value to the prosecution, including an Equusearch 'team leader' who 
testified that sections of the woodland could not be explored because 
they were waterlogged - water that prosecutors say later dried to reveal
 Caylee’s remains.

Under questioning by the defence, Mrs Anthony denied in court today that she had despatched the private investigators to search that area. 'I never sent those guys there,' she said.

But her son Lee contradicted his 
mother when called to the stand, revealing that he had had an argument 
with his mother in late 2008 over her decision to send the private 
investigators into the woods based on a tip from a psychic that the 
child was dead.

'I was 
quite angry. It was the first time I had ever heard anyone in my family 
offer it up that they were willing to look for a deceased Caylee. Before
 that, not in the realm of anybody’s mindset,' he said.

'I
 was very angry that my folks decided to do that without keeping me in 
the loop. I couldn’t believe that they could be even considering that 
Caylee may no longer be with us.'

Victim: Anthony, 25, has pleaded not guilty to killing two-year-old Caylee in the summer of 2008

Roy Kronk, a meter reader working near the Anthony family home in Orlando on August 11, 2008, testified that he saw 'something that appeared a little odd' when he stepped into the woods that day to relieve himself.

But when police officers arrived there they seemed more 'enthralled' by a dead rattlesnake and failed to check the mystery object, which he said 'appeared to look like a human skull.'

'Everything became about the dead snake,' he said, explaining the officers’ visit.

It was not until another call in December that Caylee’s remains were found.

The defence, in its opening statement, has alluded to Mr Kronk as a 'morally bankrupt' publicity-seeker, who they suggested had somehow obtained Caylee’s remains then planted them in the woods to reap a $225,000 reward. He has denied the claim.

Defence attempts to portray Mr Kronk as a villainous schemer failed to gain traction in court as recordings of three 911 calls that he made on August 11, 12 and 13, 2008, were played to jurors, illustrating how he repeatedly tried to draw investigators' attention to something 'odd' in the woods without success.

On the third call-out, he said, a deputy from Orange County Sheriff's Department came to meet him at the woods but failed to conduct a thorough search.

'He went down to the waterline, did this, did this, slipped on the mud then chewed me out for a half hour,' he said, turning his head one way and then another to demonstrate how the officer carried out only a glancing search of the waterlogged area before giving up.

The deputy has since been fired.

On December 11, with Caylee still missing, Mr Kronk returned to the woods - where the water level had now dried up - and walked up to the mystery object for the first time. He discovered that it was a skull. Unsure whether it was real, he poked a stick through the eye socket to inspect it more thoroughly.

'I gently pivoted it up, I never took it off the ground,' he stressed. 'That was a very horrific thing for me to find.'

The missed opportunities to find Caylee's remains may have meant the loss of vital forensic clues. Mr Kronk stated that he was angry that the site had not been properly investigated when he called 911 four months earlier and that he had been treated like a time-waster and a liar.

'I just simply tried to do the right thing and for my efforts to do the right thing and be a good citizen I basically got chewed up and called horrendous things...yeah, I was pretty pissed off about that,' he said.

The trial continues.
