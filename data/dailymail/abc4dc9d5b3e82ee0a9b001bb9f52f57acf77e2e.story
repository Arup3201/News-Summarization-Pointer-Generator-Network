Fine margins and good fortune allowed Bath to claim a quarter-final place on Sunday afternoon. After the scorching demolition of Toulouse a week earlier, this was a victory for the earthy virtue of pack power.

The home side had come into this contest at The Rec determined to reach the knock-out stages and also avenge the 37-10 drubbing they were subjected to in the reverse fixture back in October. 

Ultimately, they achieved both objectives, but despite finishing top of Pool Four, this was not a statement of intent that will reverberate around the European game.

Two penalty tries were a testament to Bath’s dominance in scrum and maul, but in most aspects of the game they were emphatically out-played by their Scottish opponents in this qualification decider. Glasgow’s ambition and open-field cohesion had already delivered two tries – one a long-range classic – and they so nearly snatched a third to secure a draw or win at the death.

In the last minute, Lions full back Sean Maitland – an outstanding, threatening runner throughout – surged towards the left corner. He seemed certain to score but was stopped short of the line. The danger was not averted though and Pat MacArthur lunged to touch the ball down but fumbled at agonisingly close-range.

Seconds later, Bath’s players celebrated the tense result, without knowing the wider implications. News soon filtered through from France that Toulouse, who had led the pool going into this final pool weekend, had been beaten by a single point at Montpellier, which meant that Mike Ford’s men had nipped in front of them to claim an automatic last-eight place.

Seven days after running riot against one of the continent’s superpower clubs, this was an occasion far removed from that thrilling spectacle. Bath turned the screw in the scrum; led by their Anglo-Welsh prop pair – David Wilson and Paul James. But they were only actually in front for 19 minutes of this disjointed contest, which tells a tale of their struggle to impose themselves on rivals who appeared vulnerable due to the absence of several key players.

It didn’t help Bath’s cause that they lost influential England centre Kyle Eastmond to an injury early on, while his midfield partner, Jonathan Joseph – the hero of Toulouse – had limited opportunities to provide repeat fireworks and was largely contained. So the thrills and spills of round five gave way to dogged, primal force, to become the first team to win a pool after losing their first two games.

‘Last week you saw the dash, this week you saw the grunt,’ said director of rugby Mike Ford – to neatly encapsulate the contrast. ‘I’m pleased that when we weren’t playing our “A” game, we still found a way to win. It came down to small margins – they were attacking our line at the end but we came out on the right side of it.

‘We lost our first two games in October, so to end up as pool winners is brilliant. This club wants to play in the big games. A quarter-final of the Champions Cup will be a huge game and a huge step, it will be great for us.’

Glasgow deservedly went ahead in the fifth minute as DTH van der Merwe burst through Chris Cook’s attempted tackle and released impressive Scotland centre Alex Dunbar, who raced clear to score. Finn Russell converted and later – after half-time – the fly-half set the wheels in motion for the visitors’ scintillating second try.

From turn-over ball in his own half, the Glasgow No 10 stormed over halfway on the right and sent Mark Bennett away into space. After Tommy Seymour maintained the momentum, Bennett ran on and passed out for Richie Vernon to round off a devastating counter-attack.

But for all their slick attacking, the Scottish side were undermined by their struggles up front. In the 52nd minute, Bath only had two George Ford penalties to show for their faltering efforts, but then a penalty to the left corner brought the hosts their first try. Captain Stuart Hooper won the lineout, the home pack drove for the line and when the maul went down, a penalty try was awarded, which Ford converted.

Glasgow were soon back in front courtesy of a Russell penalty, but in the 66th minute Bath’s forwards delivered another decisive show of force. Anthony Watson had just squandered a clear scoring chance in the right corner – where he was superbly held up by Russell – but the subsequent scrum was another one-sided rout which yielded another penalty try for the West Country club.

Ollie Devoto added the conversion to give Bath a five-point advantage but at the end they were hanging on. Francois Louw claimed one last turn-over to quell the Glasgow resistance and leave their head coach, Gregor Townsend, to lament the so-near-but-so-far outcome. ‘We came up two inches short,’ he said.
