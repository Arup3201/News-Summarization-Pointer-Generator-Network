A man who claims to have captured and killed Bigfoot after luring it with pork ribs has begun a tour across the south, showing off its corpse.

Rick Dyer, who describes himself as 'best Bigfoot tracker in the world', claims to have shot the beast near San Antonio in Texas in September 2012.

Despite releasing various photographs supposedly showing the dead Bigfoot, there is a great deal of skepticism over their authenticity.

Mr Dyer, who is a used car salesman, was previously involved in a Bigfoot hoax in 2008 when a 'corpse' he put on public display turned out to be a rubber suit.

Believe it or not: Here lies Bigfoot who was killed by used car salesman, Rick Dyer in 2012. He is now on tour with the corpse. Dyer is the same person who staged a Bigfoot hoax in 2008 but this time he swears he is not lying

On display: Rick Dyer released this new image, supposedly showing the Bigfoot he killed lying dead on the floor of his tent. He is now taking the corpse on a cross-country tour

Is he for real? Rick Dyer calls himself a 'Master Tracker' but also knows there are people out there who are going to dispute his claim, and he doesn't care

Raking it in: Dyer is on a nationwide tour showing off his supposed Bigfoot corpse for $20 per person

The display is now in Houston and drew about 800 people to Trader's Village in northwest Harris County on Sunday.

'We got here a day early and we just wanted to show as many people as possible,' said Mr Dyer. 'Bigfoot is not the Tooth Fairy. Bigfoot is real.'

People of all ages shelled out money to enter his trailer to look into the 9-foot case that holds the specimen Dyer calls Hank.

The body of the creature can be viewed under a glass coffin adorned with camouflaged baseball hats.

'I'm not convinced,' said Mario Lopez, after taking a look with his wife Julia and their three children. 'I believe the Roger Patterson footage is authentic because you can see the muscles and everything on there, but this one was kind of different. But he did mention that after the autopsy the body kind of changes,' he said to the Houston Chronicle.

Roger Patterson is the man who filmed one of the most famous 'sightings' back in 1967.

Patterson died in 1972, and the man who wore the gorilla suit in the film even admitted it was a hoax,

Wendy Hernandez was so convinced that she bought a shirt and had Dyer sign it. 'It's amazing when you go inside, you feel different,' she said. 'I had never seen anything like this before, only on the Discovery Channel.'

Body of the beast: Rick Dyer claims that this is a photo of legendary creature Bigfoot, which he shot near San Antonio 18 months ago

Mr Dyer claims that he lured the 800 pound beast by nailing pork ribs he had bought from Walmart to a tree in San Antonio, Texas in September 2012.

He initially released a grainy close up photograph supposedly showing the creature's face, but has now released a second photograph of it lying dead on the floor of his tent.

Speaking about inevitable doubts over the authenticity of his supposed kill, 36-year-old Dyer said he didn't regret his 2008 hoax, as it put him in contact with people who now fund his full-time Bigfoot operations ever since.

He claims that without the previous publicity stunt, he would never have been able to 'really capture' a Bigfoot.

'I have 13 months with it,' Dyer said last month. 'Then it will probably go into a museum as the first Bigfoot ever killed.'

On the Bigfoot trail: Rick Dyer says he managed to lure the beast in by nailing some pork ribs that he bought at Walmart to a tree. While the creature was eating, Mr Dyer allegedly shot it

Speaking of the moment he killed the beast, he 
said: 'I nailed... pork ribs from the Walmart down the street to the 
side of the tree, and lo and behold, he came and started eating the pork
 ribs off the tree.'

Mr 
Dyer claims to have filmed the creature as he was enjoying his last meal
 before going to get his gun and 'with tears in my eyes' shot it 
dead.

The excitement surrounding Mr Dyer's claims is tempered somewhat by the fact that he was involved in a Bigfoot hoax back in 2008.

Back then, as now, he claimed he had the body of Bigfoot. But The National Geographic reported that, once the frozen body began to thaw, the body turned out to be nothing more than a rubber ape suit.

This time Mr Dyer is adamant that his Bigfoot is 'for real'.

He said: 'From DNA tests to 3D optical scans to body scans. It is the real deal. It's Bigfoot and Bigfoot's here, and I shot it and now I'm proving it to the world.'

Committed hunter: Mr Dyer is a self-proclaimed 'real' Bigfoot tracker, although he is a used car salesman in his spare time

'There was a hoax in 2008,' he said. 
'It didn’t start out as a hoax and that’s what people don’t understand. 
This is about redeeming myself. I don’t want to go down as a hoaxer. I 
want to go down as the best Bigfoot tracker in the world.'

However, Mr Dyer has yet to produce the results of the DNA tests and optical scans.

Bigfoot sightings have been reported in forested areas all over the 
world, but physical evidence - such as a partial or complete body of the
 creature - has so far proven elusive. 

His
 tour has so far been traveling across Texas and will visit Louisiana, 
Georgia and Florida over the coming months.Admission costs $20.
