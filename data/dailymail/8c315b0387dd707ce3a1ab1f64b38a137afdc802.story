A new exhibition has opened in New York City which showcases the art of fake high fashion items and counterfeit designer products.

Faking It: Originals, Copies, and Counterfeits, which is on view at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology until April 25, 2015, also highlights the incredible popularity of certain counterfeit items, such as the much sought-after 'Homiés' designs, which were inspired by high-end brand Hermès.

And it's not just modern-day trends that are featured in the exhibit.

According to the show's curator, Ariele Elia, the trend for producing fake fashion spans many a decade - dating back to the early and mid 20th century. 

From high-end to Homiés: The exhibition showcases some counterfeit labels that have proved to be almost as popular as the original brands they were inspired by

Seeing double: It's hard to tell which is the authentic design and which is the fake. In this case, the suit on the left was a licensed copy of the Chanel original on the right

It's all about the label: The easiest way to tell these two designs apart is by spotting which one has a label, and which one doesn't

'The oldest piece we have in our show is a pair of shoes from the 18th century with paste stone buckles that imitate diamonds,' she told i-D Magazine. 

'But, copying mostly started with the advent of the couture system and designer labels. [Early and mid 20th century] couturiers created "licensed copies", which were line-for-line copies with the same materials and technique, except without labels.'

Ms Elia also explained that brands have been trying to eliminate copies of their products for decades and added that both Balenciaga and Givenchy banned all press from their 1956 collections because they thought it would help to cut down on the number of knock-off fakes being created. 

'It didn't completely work,' she said. 

'Buyers might buy one garment, but they'd see the whole collection. Photography and sketches weren't allowed in shows, so they had special copyists and sketchers who would remember.'

But while some people might view fake fashion items as being obviously cheap reproductions, when it came to differentiating between what exhibition pieces were real and which were fake, Ms Elia admitted it wasn't always that easy. 

'With some of the accessories it's very difficult to tell whether they're authentic,' she explained. 

A red sole is a red sole: Often, customers don't mind whether the product is real or fake, provided it has the same look and feel to it, such as these knock-off Christian Louboutin

All the trimmings: The distinctively red-soled shoes even came with their own fake card of authenticity

The origins of fashion: Some of the pieces included in the collection, such as these vintage dresses, help visitors to understand more about the history of clothing design

'Often, it's only on the inside where it shows. There will be shoddy construction or the leather will be buckling, even if the outside is perfect.'

The exhibition doesn't just include exact copies of high-end designs; there are a number of pieces on display which use particularly distinctive brand logos, such as those used by Louis Vuitton and Gucci, in completely unique designs, for example an original dress created by an independent designer which is then emblazoned with the iconic LV pattern. 

Interestingly, quite a few of the designers whose fake fashions are on display faced no legal action from the brands that they copied, despite their similarities being so blatant - and some designers went as far as to see the counterfeits as something of a compliment. 

'Chanel, for one, was into people knocking off her things,' Ms Elia added. 'I think she understood the fashion system and that there isn't any bad press.'
