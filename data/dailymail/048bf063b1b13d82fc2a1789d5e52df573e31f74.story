Most mothers get their first glimpse of their baby at their initial scan weeks into their pregnancy, but Ruth Carter was able to see her newborn when she was little more than a growing collection of cells.

The 42-year-old gave birth to a 'miracle' baby girl by caesarian section today at Liverpool Women's Hospital after becoming the world's first mother to give birth after conceiving with the help of pioneering new technology.

Using Eeva - Early Embryo Viability Assessment - scientists were able to use timelapse technology to monitor growth of embryos to predict which was most likely to lead to a successful pregnancy.

Technology: Scientists used time-lapse images to see how embryos were growing and predict which would lead to a healthy pregnancy

By capturing images at one minute 
intervals scientists were able to see for the first time how different embryos were growing and choose which would be most suitable for IVF.

Eeva allows embryos to be observed without removing them from an incubator so similar conditions felt by a baby developing inside the womb can be maintained.

Mrs Carter, a clinical psychologist, and her husband John Traverse, 54, had been trying for a family for eight years but sadly suffered several miscarriages.

In 2008 they went to the Hewitt Fertility Clinic at the Liverpool Women's Hospital and had their first son Jamie, now two, after a course of IVF treatment.

But it wasn't long before the couple, from Warrington, began to feel broody again, so they sought the help of leading fertility expert Professor Charles Kingsland and his team again.

Healthy girl: The 5lb 15oz girl has not yet been named but her father described her as a 'miracle'

Happy family: The couple have had one son using IVF but had also suffered several miscarriages

The healthy baby girl, who has not yet been given a name, was born weighing 5lb 5oz today.

Her father said: 'We are delighted to be the proud parents of a beautiful, healthy baby girl.

'We'd like to thank the staff at Liverpool Women's for helping to make this miracle to come true.'

Professor Kingsland, clinical director at the fertility centre, said: 'As a unit, we have never been prouder to be at the forefront of such pioneering technology.

'By investing into research and technology, we have been able to debut Eeva in Europe and lead the way in time-lapse imaging technology.

'Miracle': Scientists studied time-lapse images of embryos to predict which was most likely to develop into a healthy baby

'We're aware of how devastating 
infertility can be for couples but with our implantation rates already 
at over 44 per cent for couples under the age of 35 - we're going to 
increase this percentage further.'

Dr
Leanne Bricker, consultant in Fetal and Maternal Medicine at Liverpool 
Women's Hospital, said: 'To watch our hard work in research and 
innovation result in a real life healthy baby is the main reason we do 
what we do.

'It is why we work so hard to make people's dreams of a family become a reality.'

The Liverpool clinic was the first in Europe to be licensed to use the Eeva technology. It has not yet been given clearance for use in the US.

Cell by cell: Scientists are able to monitor the growth of embryos using the Eeva techonology

Eeva, or Early Embryo Viability Assessment, consists of a computer, video camera and software package which work together to predict an embryo's chance of becoming a healthy baby.

The technology is said to be 85 per cent accurate and can tell whether an embryo is viable - likely to lead to a successful pregnancy - within 48 hours. Experts called it the 'biggest breakthrough in IVF in the last 10 years'.

It is hoped the system will reduce the cost for couples trying IVF treatment and make repeat cycles less likely. An Eeva test costs Â£800.

In the past doctors used microscopes to study embryos as they developed. Then the embryoscope, which was introduced four years ago, took pictures every 20 minutes for doctors to study.

But Eeva is the first system to take pictures every five minutes and automatically tell which is the strongest embryo.

The system also means doctors do not have to remove embryos from incubators to study them.

Professor Charles Kingsland, of the Hewitt Fertility Centre at Liverpool Women's Hospital, said: 'You can never predict whether someone will 
have a healthy baby, but what it can do is predict with 85 per cent accuracy 
which embryo is likely to result in pregnancy without touching it.'

The company who made the system, Auxogyn, received approval for use in the EU in July 2012. It has not yet been cleared for use in the US.
