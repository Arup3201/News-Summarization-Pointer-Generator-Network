The national headquarters of Sigma Alpha Epsilon have launched an investigation into the fraternity's chapter at Louisiana Tech University after two former members came forward to say they heard the racist 'there will never be a n***** SAE' chant sung there, as well.

The Louisiana Tech chapter is the third SAE house accused of using the horrifying song that was sung by members of the fraternity at the University of Oklahoma over the weekend.

On Wednesday, the president of the University of Texas said he had ordered an investigation into claims brothers at SAE in Austin had used the tune. The fraternity headquarters is investigating in Texas, as well. 

The vile song 'there will never be a n***** SAE' was sung at the fraternity's chapter at Louisiana Tech University in 2010 and 2011, a former pledge and a former member claim

SAE is also investigating reports that the song was used at the SAE chapter at the University of Texas-Austin

According to BuzzFeed, one former members of the fraternity and one former pledge both said they had witnessed the racist chant in 2010.

The former SAE member, who remained anonymous, said he had heard it at least a dozen times in 2010 and 2011. 

'The chant was never taught to us during our official pledge education. It was taught in private,' the former SAE said. 

He added that the university didn't make up the song, claiming it had been 'going around' the fraternity for years. 

Louisiana Tech administrators told BuzzFeed on Thursday that they had met with leaders of SAE there and warned them that they had 'zero tolerance' for racist behavior. 

The shocking racist song has been circulating the SAE fraternity at OU for at least three years, trustees said 

Dylan Merriman, who was an SAE pledge, told BuzzFeed he was at a party at the fraternity when a drunken brother chanted 'there will never be a n***** SAE.'

Merriman said the member then pointed at a picture of his SAE brother and exclaimed, 'There was never a n-word in this chapter and there never will be.' 

Merriman said he left the fraternity not long after the incident.  

SAE spokesman Brandon Weghorst confirmed Thursday investigations into chapters at the University of Texas-Austin and Louisiana Tech University in Ruston.

Weghorst says none of the allegations have been substantiated, and the UT chapter is being 'fully cooperative.' He says the Louisiana Tech probe is still in its early stages.

Late Wednesday, the board of trustees and alumni of the University of Oklahoma's SAE chapter acknowledged in a statement the chant surfaced at the chapter 'three to four years ago.' OU President David Boren said the university is investigating fraternity members to determine their 'level of responsibility.'
