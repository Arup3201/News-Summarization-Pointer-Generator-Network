Vivid founder Steve Hirsch told TMZ; 'This is the most unique footage Vivid has ever released. The sky is the limit on this movie.'

He also seems to think the video will sell well, paying Chandler in the mid-to-high six figures for her work.

Vivid is the same company responsible for numerous celebrity sex tapes, including the famous Kim Kardashian and Ray J video. 

Chandler, 41, was actually born a boy, and named David Roy Fitch at birth.

As a teenager however Chandler went on testosterone blockers and had her name changed and then, in her early twenties, underwent corrective surgery to get rid of her male genitalia.

Chandler was born a male however in name only, and is actually intersex, meaning she had male genitalia, but no testicles, while also having a uterus and no ovaries.

She claims that she and Phelps clicked after meeting on Tinder.

'Spending time with him was like a teenage love affair,' she says.

'I have never felt so comfortable and accepted in every way as I did with him.' 

Chatty Cathy: Chandler has detailed her relationship with Phelps in numerous interviews

She had previously detailed their first date, to a Baltimore Ravens games, to the National Enquirer.

'One thing led to the next, and we made love during halftime,' she claims in the interview.

'Later, we had sex again. The intimacy with him was amazing! It was the first time in my life that someone has made me feel like a true woman.'

She also told the magazine that she never lied to the swimmer about her past, saying it just never came up. 

Chandler also claims she was with Phelps when he was arrested on suspicion of DUI on September 30 in Baltimore, Maryland.

The swimmer entered rehab just a few days after the incident and completed his program last November.
