Jane Asher has admitted she was wrong to be so cynical as her bakeware range launched at Poundland has been so successful sales have soared past £2 million.

Celebrity cake-maker Jane, 68, admits that she had doubts when she was offered a role as ambassador for the high street chain.

But now the mother of three says that the link-up is a 'terrific fit' and even jokes that Poundland should be called Jane AsherLand.

Jane's bargain bakeware range at Poundland has seen sales in excess of £2 million

The thrifty store first introduced the bargain bakeware last year ahead of the hugely popular Great British Bake Off TV show. 

It was revealed yesterday in The Grocer magazine that the 80 product range was the store's most popular and fastest-selling line yet.

The magazine further reported that collection which launched in April this year has generated sales in excess of £2 million.

Despite the huge success of the range Jane says she never expected it to do so well as she was concerned about the product quality.

'I'm not an obvious match for Poundland. It sounds soppy, but people trust that I use what I promote 

'I assumed they would source some stuff from the Far East and I would say "this is going to fall to bits" and that would be that, but it wasn't like that at all' she told The Grocer.

Jane assumed that her range would be bad quality but she has been pleasantly surprised by the cheap products on offer

Jane went on to say that by convincing a sceptic such as herself Poundland would be able to attract other sceptical shoppers.

'I've been as surprised as anyone by being so wrong which is why I think it's very clever of them to use someone like me.

'It's ended up being a terrific fit. They are the nicest company I have ever worked for and I've worked with a lot.'

Although Jane says that she is very proud of her range she says that perhaps it is not best suited for highly ambitious bakers. 

'I love the idea you can have scales for a pound. Now, they are not going to last you. If you were seriously into baking they would drive you mad, but for a child, or for somebody starting off, they are perfect.' 

The celebrity baker even hopes that shop will go as far to credit her in the store name. 

' I said we might have to make it Jane AsherLand. It's the only answer. '

Jane, who lives in London's affluent Chelsea, says she is a big fan of Waitrose when it comes to shopping for food however she also  says she enjoys shopping in discounted retailers and hopes to see a pound shop on the Kings Road soon.

'There aren't many near here in posh snobby Chelsea. We don't have a Poundland either. But it wouldn't surprise me if we see one soon.'
