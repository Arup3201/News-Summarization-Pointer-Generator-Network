They may both be a grandmother of the future King, but it seems that Carole Middleton and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall don't share the public's vote when it comes to style.

Kate's mother Carole has pipped Camilla to the top spot when it comes to Queen of the 'Glam-Mas'.

A new survey has revealed that 40 per cent of grandmother's vote Carole, 58, as their poster girl, with just 2 per cent opting for 66-year-old Camilla.

Other glamorous grandmothers to rank highly were the age-defying Goldie Hawn, 67, and domestic goddess Mary Berry, 78.

The survey also revealed that 88 per cent of British grandmother’s now consider themselves to be ‘Glam-mas’, and are a serious force to be reckoned with in the style stakes.

With the average age of a British grandparent now under 50, researchers have discovered that grandmothers are now choosing to step away from their traditional stereotype and as a result have become somewhat of a style inspiration for many of their younger family members.

Of those surveyed, an incredible 92 per cent stated that they actively followed the latest fashions, with classic and smart trends proving to be the most popular. 

It's a style-off! Carole was voted the poster girl of the grandmother's with 40 per cent of the votes, whilst Camilla received 2 per cent

Similarly, it appears that 
grandmothers today are on the pulse when it comes to what styles to 
avoid, with dresses above the knee and tight fitting pieces topping the 
poll as the biggest fashion faux pas.

This
new breed of ‘Glam-ma’ is also determined to keep their wardrobes up to
date, with 44 per cent of those asked admitting to spending up to £100 
each month on new purchases.

And it’s not just the seniors  who rank themselves highly in 
the style stakes, as over 50 per cent of grandchildren surveyed also 
agree that their grandmother is a style muse – with the majority stating it 
is their grandmother’s attitude towards her outfit choices that they 
admire the most.

A spokesperson for Kaleidoscope, who carried out the survey, said: 'I think it’s fantastic to see from our survey results that so many grandmothers are enjoying fashion and feeling confident and comfortable enough to experiment with different styles and trends.

'As we’ve highlighted, the average age of a British grandparent is a lot younger than it used to be, so it is not surprising that the traditional view of what a grandma should look like has now become outdated.

'A lot of these women will have spent
many years working hard and raising their families so it’s great that 
they can now find the time to focus on themselves and have some fun with
fashion.

'There
are so many super stylish grandmas in the public eye at present such as
Carole Middleton and Mary Berry that are really leading the way for 
British women and providing them with a huge pool of style inspiration.'

Bets of the rest: Mary Berry and Goldie Hawn were also voted as stylish glam-mas

The X Factor: Sharon Osbourne and Jane Fonda were also praised for their style
