Convicted: Lisa Biron (pictured) faces at least 25 years in jail after being found guilty of abducting a teenage girl to Canada and forcing her to have sex on camera

A jury took less than an hour to convict a female lawyer who worked with an anti-gay Christian group for abducting a teenage girl and forcing her to have sex on camera while on bail for child pornography charges.

Lisa Biron, 43, did not display any emotion as the verdict was read during the January court appearance in New Hampshire.

She faces a minimum 25 year sentenced when she is sentenced later this month. 

'It was just very difficult, and I don't think I should say much more than that,' juror Peter Evans told a local television station.

'The evidence was pretty overwhelming, and the decision, I'm sure, was accurate.'

Biron was arrested by FBI agents in a Manchester courtroom while awaiting a hearing on district-level charges of possessing pornographic material on her computer.

A few hours later, she was taken into a court in Concord, New Hampshire, accused of taking the teenage girl to Canada, making her engage in sexual activity and convincing her to let it be filmed.

Biron, who is associated with the anti-gay group Alliance Defending Freedom, was initially arrested after a man walked into the Manchester Police Department claiming he had seen pornography on her computer.

After a search of her computer, police found five videos and two pictures of a teenage girl on her computer.

Biron was released on bail on seven charges of possessing child pornography earlier this month.

After her arrest by the FBI, she allegedly told agents they would find a loaded pistol under her mattress.

They didn't find a weapon, but they did discover 200 rounds of ammunition in her Manchester home.

At the hearing on federal-level charges, the prosecutor also alleged that:

Biron's lawyer, Jim Moir, asked the judge to consider his clients lack of criminal history and that she had attended all of her court appearances, according to the Concord Monitor.

But Judge Landya McCafferty remanded her in custody after saying she was 'not at all comfortable' that she would comply with any new bail conditions.

She is due to stand trial in January on the federal charges of transportation with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, possession of child pornography and five counts of sexual exploitation of children. She faces up to life in prison if convicted.

Biron, who was briefly associated with the Donais Law Offices in Manchester before her arrest, has been suspended indefinitely.

On Biron's Facebook page, she lists the Bible as her favorite book.
