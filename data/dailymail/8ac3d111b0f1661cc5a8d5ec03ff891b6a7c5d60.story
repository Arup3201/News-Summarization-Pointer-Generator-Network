A member of the New Black Panther Party who has a large
tattoo on his face that reads ‘Kill Whitey’ was arrested on charges of gun
possession.

Maruse Heath, the head of the Philadelphia chapter of the
New Black Panthers, was arrested in New York City after police claim they saw
him leaving a Party meeting wearing a large bullet proof vest.

Heath, 41, who also goes by King Salim Shabazz, was found
holding an unlicensed, loaded gun when he was stopped by police.

Heath, 41, is the leader of the Philadelphia chapter of the New Black Panthers and was planning an anniversary 15 Million Man March with the group before he was arrested in Harlem

At his arraignment Heath’s lawyer claimed that his client
was ‘jumped’ by the police in Harlem after leaving a meeting to plan the group’s 15th
Anniversary Million Man March commemoration in September, according
to The New York Post.

‘I don’t believe there’s any justification for the stop,’ Heath’s
lawyer Brad Foster said.

The cops stopped Heath at night because he was allegedly wearing a bullet proof vest, but Foster argued they couldn’t have seen what his client was wearing in the dark.

In addition to his 'Kill Whitey' tattoo, Heath has multiple tattoo on his face referencing black power groups and associated phrases

In these pictures Heath shows off his black pride tattoos including one on his lower right cheek that reads 'Freeborn,' presumably referring to African Americans former enslavement

Heath's entire face is covered in 'black power' tattoos including one not pictured here which reads 'Kill Whitey' described by Urban Dictionary as a phrase yelled to intimidate white prisoners in prison

‘It’s very dark, 10:30 at night,' Foster said. 'They grabbed him by the shoulders
and cuffed him and he was in custody.’

However, Assistant District Attorney Christopher Ryan argued
that the size-52 ballistic vest Heath was wearing was easy to see in the dark.

‘A 52, sized as regular men’s clothing, is clearly obvious,’ the prosecutor said.

During Heath's (seen here wearing a Black Panthers beret and holding a riffle) arraignment, the prosecutor referred to the New Black Panther Party as 'the functional equivalent of the KKK'

If convicted Heath faces a minimum of three and a half years
for gun possession. He is currently being held on $75,000 bail.

Ryan also brought into question Heath’s involvement in the
New Black Panther Group. ‘It is my understanding that the New Black Panther
Party is the functional equivalent of the KKK,’ he said.

‘It is no crime to belong to the Black Panther Party,’ Heath’s
lawyer countered, according to the newspaper. ‘The group does, ‘charity work
within the local community, outreach to the homeless, and works with at-risk
youth who are at risk of becoming criminals.’’

A militant member of the New Black Panther Party, Heath is the head of the organizations Philadelphia chapter. He was arrested in New York after leaving a group meeting wearing a bullet proof vest

At his arraignment Heath's (pictured left) lawyer told the court that the New Black Panther party is not a violent group, but instead is a vehicle for community service

In addition to his involvement in the group, Heath’s
‘Kill Whitey’ tattoo also suggests something violent in his character.

According to Urban Dictionary, Heath’s aggressive and
distinctive tattoo is ‘What is loudly shouted by white prisoners in mock style
of black inmates’ or ‘What Anarchist[s] say when opposing the man.’

Both definitions demonstrate that the epithet is meant as an
intimation tactic towards Caucasians.

Heath's lawyer argued that his client (pictured here) was wrongly stopped by police who couldn't have seen that he was wearing a bullet proof vest in the dark

Heath has also been videotaped spewing violent comments at a festival celebrating African Heritage, 'You want freedom you gonna have to kill some crackers. You gonna have to kill some of they babies. Let us get our act together. It's time to wake up, clean up, and stand up.'

This is not Heath’s first encounter with the law due to his involvement with the New Black Panther Party.

In 2008, Heath and a fellow Party member were arrested
outside of a Philadelphia polling place for allegedly intimidating white
voters.

Heath and Jerry Jackson were videotaped in front of the voting station wearing paramilitary
uniforms and carrying night sticks.

In 2008 Heath #seen here looking at the camera) was arrested on charges of voter intimation after he was filmed outside a polling place in Philadelphia in paramilitary garb carrying a nightstick (seen in his left hand)

When police arrested Heath he allegedly shouted, ‘That’s why
you’re going to be ruled by a black man now,’ according to bizpacreview.com.

Though no voters complained about the incident, the Justice
Department Civil Rights Division prosecutor who saw the video filled a lawsuit
against Heath and the New Black Panthers.

The case was eventually dismissed amidst much controversy alleging
that courts were biased and trying solely to protect minorities.
