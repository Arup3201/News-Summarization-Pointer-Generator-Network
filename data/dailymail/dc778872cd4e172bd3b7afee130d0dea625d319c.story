A killer was caught on camera stalking his victim minutes after she was refused a lift home by police.

Carl Powell, 24, was filmed walking a few yards behind Caroline Coyne in the residential street in which she would meet her death.

Six minutes later he is pictured running away after battering the 28-year-old mother of two to death with a lump of concrete.

Tragic: Police suggested Caroline Coyne (left), 28, should call a cab when she asked for a life, but she walked away and within an hour had been attacked in Nottingham by Carl Powell (right), 24, who has been jailed for life

After leaving relatives at around 11pm, Miss Coyne climbed into the back of a marked police car and asked to be taken home, Nottingham Crown Court heard.

The officers told the jury they advised her to get a taxi, adding: ‘We are not a taxi service.’

She then tried to board an out-of-service bus before heading toward the road in which she was murdered.

Her body was found in an alleyway the next morning.

Miss Coyne is believed to have been killed there after refusing Powell’s demands for sex.

Speaking outside court, Ms Coyne's stepfather Jason Stansfield said the family held Nottinghamshire Police responsible for putting her in the path of her murderer that night.

He said the police could have used their powers to take Ms Coyne home when she jumped into their car, as she was clearly intoxicated and in need of assistance.

‘Instead they were dismissive of her and, in the words of the defence barrister Mr Smith, she was treated as an inconvenience,’ Mr Stansfield said.

‘The two officers simply pointed her in the direction of home and watched her stagger off for a few seconds until she disappeared from view.

‘It is the family's opinion that Caroline was failed by Nottinghamshire Police that night (who had) the chance to ensure a vulnerable young woman, worse the wear for drink, was taken to a place for safety.

'So the police, in our opinion, failed Caroline and their advice to take a taxi put her right in the path of her murderer.’

Mr Stansfield added that a bus driver and a colleague, who drove past Ms Coyne and swerved out of her way when she stepped into the road and tried to flag the vehicle down, were also accountable.

‘The bus was not in regular service,’ he said. ‘It was effectively a taxi for other bus drivers finishing their shifts and did not come off duty until 5am that day.’

He added: ‘I was always led to believe that bus drivers would give free passage to children and vulnerable adults if it was needed. Caroline flagged them down and was asking for help and was ignored.

‘The bus driver who was a passenger on that bus reported during the trial they get drunk people a lot flagging them down and it was normal.

‘So too it seems was their callousness and disregard for public safety whilst at the same time expecting their custom.’

A second camera had earlier captured 
Powell watching Miss Coyne  wandering apparently the worse for drink 
after a family gathering.

Yesterday he was jailed for life with a minimum term of 20 years after being found guilty of murdering Miss Coyne and sexually assaulting another woman he dragged off the street a month later.

The man who found Miss Coyne’s body was awoken by her cries of ‘Get off me’ but went back to bed when he failed to find anyone outside.

A post-mortem examination found she died of head injuries.

At the time of the attack – in July 2011 – she was living in Top Valley, Nottingham, with her partner and sons, aged seven and one.

The court heard that Powell’s second victim was also walking home after a night out in Nottingham when he grabbed her by the throat and dragged her into the grounds of a college where he assaulted her.

She persuaded Powell not to harm her further and was able to recall enough of the encounter to help  police identify him.

The 22-year-old said yesterday that she believes she survived the attack by remaining calm and trying ‘to convince him I liked him’ – promising that she would meet him again on another day.

Powell was found guilty of false imprisonment, false imprisonment with intent to commit a sexual offence and sexual assault in relation to that attack and was handed a concurrent four-year jail term.

Passing sentence, Mr Justice Flaux said Powell had ‘effectively stalked’ Miss Coyne, putting on gloves and a hood before following her down a garden pathway.

He added: ‘Only you know what happened in that dark alleyway, but it is clear you cornered and attacked her. You subjected Caroline to a savage attack, bludgeoning her over her head, causing injuries from which she would die alone and defenceless.’

After the verdict, Detective Chief Inspector Tony Heydon of Nottinghamshire Police said many officers were asked for lifts home and the two in this case had acted in accordance with protocol.

The victim’s mother, Mandy Coyne, said her grandchildren could not understand ‘why their mummy isn’t around’.

Plea for help: Ms Coyne was seen on a bus 
CCTV camera trying to wave it down just minutes before she died

Assistance plea: The driver of the out-of-service bus was taking staff members home when he spotted her

Dangerous: The driver claimed he was forced to brake and swerve to prevent the bus from hitting Ms Coyne

Caroline's mother Mandy Coyne said: 'Caroline (right) was a beautiful little girl, who grew into a strong-willed and determined young woman. She lived for her two sons, and played a big part in our family life. 'Her murder has devastated everyone and it has been so difficult for us all, and especially her boys to understand why their mummy isn’t around.'Cameron, who is now nine, keeps asking questions about what happened and who did this. While it doesn’t change the fact she can’t see them grow up, it will be slightly easier now to explain to him that the person who did this has been sent to prison.'Caroline had an extremely loving nature. She is missed every day and somehow we have to find a way of living without her.'I would also like to thank my family and friends for their support, the prosecution, DCI Tony Heydon, DC Mark Petrovic, Emily and Kathy from victim support.'
