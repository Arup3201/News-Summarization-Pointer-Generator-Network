A 35-year-old mathematician hacked OkCupid and found his future-fiancee in just 90 days all with the help of computer algorithms.

The dating site founded by Harvard students in 2004 matches singles looking for love based on a compatibility percentage rendered from a questionnaire.

According to Wired, Boston-born Chris McKinlay was working on his PhD at UCLA in June 2012 when he signed up for the site, but was having dismal luck finding a mate.In total, he had gone on just six first dates since signing up and less than 100 women had over a 90 per cent compatibility rating.

During an early morning computer lab session, it dawned on McKinlay that he could apply his data skills to the site.

The way OkCupid works is that individuals create their own profiles, and then answer 350 questions from a pool of thousands of questions. They answer each randomly picked question and then they weight the importance of that question on a scale from 'irrelevant' to 'mandatory'. McKinlay realized that he could only be matched with someone if they answered the same questions as him.

In order to get around that, he created 12 robot profiles that answered all of the questions randomly, so that he could mine the survey answers from all the female profiles. After three weeks, McKinlay had collected 6 million question answers from 20,000 women across the country while spending most nights sleeping in his computer lab cubicle.

Using an algorithm he was then able to sort the women, focusing on a sample of 5,000 who live in LA or San Francisco and had logged onto the site within the last month. The algorithm was then able to sort the women into different clusters of types based on characteristics in their profiles.

Two clusters of women he found particularly interesting. The first was a group of women in their mid-twenties who seemed to be indie types, musicians and artists. The other cluster was slightly older who had professional creative jobs in editing and design. So he created two different profiles to focus on each cluster and then he answered the top 500 survey questions for each group.

Perfect match: McKinlay was a PhD student at UCLA in June 2012 when he decided to apply his data skills to the dating site

He filled out the questions honestly, since he didn't want any future relationship to be based on 'computer-generated lies', but he did follow the data on what to rank each question for importance.

For example, one question was: 'Regardless of future plans, what's more interesting to you right now? Sex or love?' McKinlay picked 'love' but rated the question 'very important' for the first group and 'mandatory' for the second group.

After answering the questions he saw his matches and the results were astounding. He had more than ten thousand matches with compatibility over 90 per cent

The last step was to get attention from his matches. On OkCupid, users are notified when someone looks at their profile, so McKinlay set up the computers so that they would view as many profiles as possible. This prompted matches to message him back when they saw his profile and they were interested.

'I haven’t until now come across anyone with such winning numbers, AND I find your profile intriguing,' one woman wrote him. Also, something about a rugged man who’s really good with numbers … Thought I’d say hi.

He says he received about 20 messages a day.

On June 30, the computer part was over when he went on his first date. By date 20 he noticed that women in the first group usually had two or more tattoos and lived in East LA. Many of the women in the second group seemed to have midsized dogs.

Eventually he deleted the profile for the first group of younger women after spending too much time commuting to meet them.

After a month he had been on 55 dates. Three led to second dates and only one had led to a third date. It wasn't until date 88 that he met the one: Christine Tien Wang, a 28-year-old artist and prison abolition activist who was getting her masters in fine arts from UCLA. She had been matched with McKinlay while searching for a 6-foot male with blue eyes who lived near campus. They were a 91 per cent match.

Self-help: McKinlay has since written a book on the whole experience, advising others on the best way to look for love on the site

For their first date they walked around a sculpture garden and got sushi and something clicked. Soon, McKinlay revealed his OkCupid resaerch and Wang found the whole plan compelling.

'I thought it was dark and cynical,' she said. 'I liked it.'

The two continued to date even after Wang got a one-year art fellowship in Qatar. Soon after their first anniversary, McKinlay proposed to her with a diamond ring over Skype. She said yes.

While most people wouldn't be able to pull off the complex computer mathematics McKinlay did to find his soul mate, he believes what he did is just a 'large-scale and machine-learning version of what everyone does on the site'.

McKinlay adds that it wasn't the math that made their relationship work.

'It was just a mechanism to put us in the same room. I was able to use OkCupid to find someone.'

'People are much more complicated than their profiles,' Wang said. 'So the way we met was kind of superficial, but everything that happened after is not superficial at all. It’s been cultivated through a lot of work.'

McKinlay has since received his PhD and is teaching math while working on a postgraduate degree in music. He recently published a book on his OkCupid experience titled 'Optimal Cupid: Mastering the Hidden Logic of OkCupid' which seeks to help other people best use the site.
