An Arizona judge on Friday refused to
grant a divorce for a transgender Arizona man who gave birth to three 
children after beginning to change his sex from female.

Maricopa
County Family Court Judge Douglas Gerlach ruled that Arizona's ban on 
same-sex marriages prevents Thomas Beatie's 9-year union from being 
recognized as valid.

Thomas
Beatie was born a woman and later underwent a double-mastectomy, and 
began testosterone hormone therapy and psychological treatment to become
a man, but he retained female reproductive organs and gave birth to 
three children.

Divorcing: 'Pregnant Man' Thomas Beatie, right, is hoping to divorce his wife Nancy, left, but an Arizona judge is not convinced their marriage was legal in the first place

Gerlach said he had no jurisdiction 
to approve a divorce because there's insufficient evidence that Beatie 
was a man when he married Nancy Beatie in Hawaii. He said the Beaties 
never provided records to fully explain what Thomas Beatie actually had 
done and not done to become a man.

'The decision here is not based on 
the conclusion that this case involves a same-sex marriage merely 
because one of the parties is a transsexual male, but instead, the 
decision is compelled by the fact that the parties failed to prove that 
(Thomas Beatie) was a transsexual male when they were issued their 
marriage license,' he wrote in Friday's ruling.

A spokesman for Beatie, Ryan Gordon, 
said the judge's comments came as a shock and that Beatie plans to 
appeal the ruling. He said Beatie legally was married as a man and never
was required to disclose that he retained female reproductive organs 
when applying for and being granted a new birth certificate in Hawaii as
a man. He said Beatie halted testosterone treatments so that he could 
give birth to his children.

'It's unfortunate that the judge out here doesn't recognize marriage in another state,' Gordon said.

Beatie is eager to end his marriage, 
but the couple's divorce plans stalled last summer when Gerlach said he 
was unable to find legal authority defining a man as someone who can 
give birth.

Gerlach's ruling didn't address 
whether Arizona law allows a person who was born female to marry another
female after undergoing a sex change operation.

A separate ruling issued Friday by 
Gerlach sets guidelines on how the Beaties will co-parent their three 
children and grants them joint authority in making legal decisions. 
Thomas Beatie is required to pay nearly $240 a month to Nancy Beatie for
child support, but she won't get alimony because the marriage was 
declared invalid.

Nancy Beatie's attorney, David 
Higgins, praised Gerlach for the thoroughness of the decision on the 
marriage, although it wasn't the one she had hoped for.

'He still sees a same-sex marriage, but he gave us all the rulings that we're asking for as far as the children,' Higgins said.

The National Center for Lesbian 
Rights, which isn't involved in the Beatie divorce case, has said courts
have declared marriages involving a transgender person invalid in a 
handful of cases across the country, but that those cases had different 
factual and legal issues than those in the Beatie case.

Thomas Beatie, known as 'The Pregnant
Man,' was born Tracy Lehuanani Lagondino in Oahu, Hawaii. He began 
testosterone treatments in 1997 and underwent double mastectomy and 
chest reconstruction surgery in 2002. He changed his Hawaii driver's 
license to say he was a man and had a Hawaiian court approve his name 
change to Thomas.

Gerlach's ruling noted that Thomas 
Beatie halted the testosterone treatments and that he didn't provide 
documentation for any additional non-surgical efforts.

Thomas Beatie married his partner 
Nancy in early 2003 in Honolulu and became pregnant because Nancy was 
unable to have children. Thomas Beatie conceived with donated sperm and 
gave birth to children who are now 4, 3 and 2 years old. The couple 
eventually moved to Arizona.

Beatie has garnered a range of media 
attention, making the rounds on talk shows such as Larry King and Oprah 
Winfrey and winning a spot on Barbara Walters' list of '10 Most 
Fascinating People' in 2008, alongside President Barack Obama, 
conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh and swimmer Michael Phelps.

He 
also published a book, 'Labor Of Love: The Story of One Man's 
Extraordinary Pregnancy,' the cover displaying an image of a shirtless 
Thomas sporting facial hair and holding a hand over his bare pregnant 
belly.
