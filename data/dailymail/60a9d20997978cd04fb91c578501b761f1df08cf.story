A millionaire who allegedly ran over the foot of an NYPD officer in his Ferrari has had the criminal case against him dropped.

Julien Chabbott, a 29-year-old social media entrepreneur and ex-boyfriend of Hills reality star Stephanie Pratt, was told at Manhattan criminal court on Thursday that prosecutors had dropped his misdemeanor assault case.

However Chabbott faces a civil trial over the alleged injury which happened in Manhattan's trendy Soho district last August.

Gets away with it: Julien Chabbott, a 29-year-old millionaire, was told at Manhattan criminal court on Thursday that prosecutors had dropped his misdemeanor assault case after he allegedly ran over this NYPD cop's foot in his Ferrari

A judge at Manhattan Criminal Court judge said the charges will be dismissed because the police officer did not suffer long-term injury. Chabbott has been ordered to complete five days of community service.

A video posted on YouTube at the time 
shows the moment Chabbott returned to his $257,000 red Ferrari 458 to 
find the officer issuing a parking ticket outside the Mercer Hotel.

He
refused to listen to why the officer was issuing the ticket and instead
jumped behind the wheel and attempted to drive off, in the process 
allegedly running over the officer's foot. 

Pratt, who was dating the millionaire 
at the time, looked on as her boyfriend was hauled out of the car, 
thrown to the ground and handcuffed.

Sources close to Chabbott told TMZ 
that he was furious about his treatment, claiming the officer 'faked' an 
injury, and that his car had been left in the no parking zone by a 
valet.

Chabbott's lawyer reiterated that claim outside court in Manhattan today.

Defense lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, told the New York Post: 'The police officer claimed the car ran over his foot, but you can see it in the video - the car lurches an inch or two forward, and grazes the pant leg of the officer.'

A lawyer for the NYPD officer said that he would filed a civil suit within 30 days.

Damian Mory, a passer-by, caught the whole incident on camera and posted it on YouTube in August 2012.

The video shows Chabbott climbing into 
his red Ferrari as the officer stand in front of the car in an effort 
to stop the man driving away.  As the men continue to shout at one 
another, the driver pulls forward slightly.

Seconds later, the officer 
then slams his fist into the car’s window yelling that his foot has been
run over.

‘You run down my ******* foot’, the officer screamed. The cop opens the car door and drags the driver out as 
other officers gather round to help pin the man to the ground. 

Witnesses
at the scene allege that the car was legally parked in a hotel’s valet 
zone and the hotel had approved the Ferrari to be parked there.

Chabbott invented the app LineSnob and currently lives in Chelsea.
