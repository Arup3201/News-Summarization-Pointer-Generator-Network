A Jack Russell terrier mix learned a valuable lesson recently after getting his head stuck in a irrigation pipe while chasing a squirrel.

Veterinarians were able to sedate the puppy and remove its head from the irrigation pipe.

While the squirrel made it through the pipe without incident, the daft dog didn't seem to realize he would have more problems and ended up with his head stuck in the tube.

At first his owners tried to free him using grease but had no luck.

Next they took the dog and the pipe to the fire department, who recommended a trip to the vet.

An a nearby animal clinic the veterinarians were able to sedate the pup and then safely remove his head from the pipe.

This is one dog likely to think twice about chasing any squirrels in future.
