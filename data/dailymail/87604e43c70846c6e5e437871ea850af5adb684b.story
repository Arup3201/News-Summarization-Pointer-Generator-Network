Parents could one day wave goodbye to the school run and pack their children off in a driverless car, a transport minister has predicted.

Claire Perry said she has a 'vision' of futuristic vehicles picking children up in the morning and bringing them home at 3.30pm.

But she warned of the dangers of relying on technology which could be vulnerable to a cyber attack.

The future? Trials of driverless cars are to start in four towns next year, including Milton Keynes (pictured), with ministers predicting they could take over the school run

The first major trials of driverless cars in the UK are expected to begin within weeks.

Bristol, Greenwich, Coventry and Milton Keynes will all host autonomous driving projects that will run for between 18 and 36 months starting from January 2015.

Ministers hope to make Britain a world leader in the technology. Google has unveiled a computerised ‘hands-free’ self-driving bubble car, which has no steering wheel, brake or accelerator pedals, just buttons for start, pull over and emergency stop and a computer screen showing your route.

Miss Perry told MPs she wants driverless cars to be seen as 'assisted technology' and not 'zombie robot taxis'.

Giving evidence to the transport select committee, she said: 'My personal view, I think it's incredibly exciting because there is an opportunity to use time and capacity more effectively.

'We are short of capacity in terms of roads in this country, we are all short of time. Anything we can do to use capacity more intelligently and preserve safety and give people more time is a good thing.'

She added: 'I have a vision of the school run driverless car where you put your children in and wave them off to school and then they come back at 3.30pm.

'Driverless buses – I know it makes everyone nervous – but anything you can do to make mass vehicles more cost effective would be interesting as well. So I think there is huge potential, but we are on an evolution.'

Coventry and Milton Keynes: Engineers involved in the Autodrive Programme will develop infrastructure to best work with autonomous cars navigating real roads.

Driverless pods will ferry individuals around pedestrianised areas of Milton Keynes.

Greenwich: The Gateway project will test automated electric shuttles buses and robotic valet parking.

Bristol: The insurance implications of driverless vehicles will be explored by the Venturer consortium.

The programme will also look at how cars cope with the city's challenging terrain and how they are received by the public.

As part of the trials, Milton Keynes and Coventry will share the UK Autodrive programme, which involves Ford, Jaguar Land Rover as well as a number of universities and engineering consultancies.

They will test self-driving cars on real roads as well as lightweight self-driving pods designed for pedestrianised areas in Milton Keynes.

It is hoped that testing driverless cars in a real-world environment will help lead to greater levels of understanding of the vehicles and will allow the public to imagine how the cars could fit into everyday life.

The Institution of Engineering and Technology has predicted that within 15 years there will be vehicles taking people and freight across the country without drivers.

Miss Perry conceded that there are concerns about the security of web technlogoly which could be targeted by hackers.

But she added: 'The challenge overall is more about cyber security. The more we are all dependent on cyber information to work out where we are to the road network, to have the road networks communicating that there is a particular breakdown and that is a huge challenge across Government and society.'
