A teenage soldier died alongside five of his army colleagues in a massive bomb blast after taking the place of a fellow private at the last minute, an inquest heard.

Private Christopher Kershaw 
volunteered to drive the Warrior armoured vehicle but tragically it was blown up just minutes later.

The 19-year-old serviceman died died alongside 
Sergeant Nigel Coupe, 33, Corporal Jake Hartley, 20, and Privates 
Anthony Frampton, 20, Daniel Wade, 20, and Daniel Wilford, 21, during 
the incident in Helmand Province.

Sgt Coupe, a 
member of 1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment, and his 
comrades, all members of The Yorkshire Regiment’s 3rd Battalion, would likely have been killed or knocked unconscious instantly by the blast, and unaware of what happened afterwards.

The inquest at Oxford Coroner's Court heard today that the explosion turned the vehicle upside down and blew off its gun turret. Ammunition on board the 
vehicle ignited, causing a fierce fire.

The Warrior, known by the callsign 
K12, was patrolling with another vehicle about 25 miles north of Lashkar Gah when the explosion happened on March 6 last year.

The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack which was the single deadliest strike on British forces in Afghanistan since 2001.

After the explosion, soldiers in a second Warrior vehicle reported hearing an explosion and then seeing a 'fireball' as it ignited.

In a statement read to the court, 
Private Luke Stones, of 3 YORKS, described how Pte Kershaw - who was 
driving the Warrior - had volunteered to take the place of another 
soldier on the patrol.

'Private Butler would have been the 
driver of K12 but he was returning from the shower and as a result Pte 
Kershaw offered to take his place,' he said.

Pte Stones, who was the gunner in 
the second of the two Warriors on the ill-fated patrol, explained he was
sitting in the turret when he heard a loud explosion and felt his 
vehicle shake.

Grief: Monica Kershaw holds a picture of her son Christopher who died after taking the place of one of his army colleagues at the last moment

He stood up immediately to see what had happened.

'There was a large fireball which had flames reaching about 100ft high,' he said.

'I stood staring at the fireball, not really understanding what I was looking at.

'The turret was on fire as well, 
burning independently. The flames were too intense to see which position
the vehicle had come to rest in.

'I heard a series of explosions coming from the destroyed Warrior.'

The inquest heard that all six 
men died of blast injuries caused by the explosion.

As they cleared a safe path to the 
Warrior and tried to put the blaze out, colleagues from the second 
vehicle described hearing ammunition ignite and ricochet inside the 
stricken vehicle.

A statement from Pte Aiden Walker said: 'I could hear ammunition "cooking off", that’s detonating due to the heat of the fire. I believe that no-one in the Warrior was alive and could have survived the explosion.'

His view was shared by Warrant Officer
Second Class Eric Whitehouse, who described hearing a series of 
explosions inside the Warrior as he tried in vain to extinguish the 
blaze using fire extinguishers.

'It was apparent that anyone involved in the explosion could not have survived the blast.'

Grief: Hearses carrying the six bodies are driven through Carterton, Oxfordshire, in March last year after the men were repatriated to the UK

The inquest heard that an intelligence
briefing was given to troops due to go on the patrol earlier that day, 
which had included Pte Kershaw despite his late addition to the patrol.

Intelligence officer Staff Sergeant Scot Cooper told the inquest that the IED threat at that time in the area was low.

Father-of-two Sgt Coupe, from Lytham 
St Annes, Lancashire; Pte Wade, from Warrington, Cheshire, who was about
to become a father; Cpl Hartley, from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire; Pte 
Frampton and Pte Wilford, both from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, and 
Pte Kershaw, from Bradford, had all only been in Afghanistan for a few 
weeks.

The tragedy was, and remains, the 
biggest single loss of life for British forces in Afghanistan since an 
RAF Nimrod crash killed 14 people in September 2006.

The inquest comes as the MoD yesterday
announced the death of the 445th UK service member to have lost their 
life since operations in Afghanistan began in October 2001.

The hearing continues.
