A 19-year-old Chicago woman has been 
charged with first degree murder for helping lure her ex-boyfriend into 
the clutches of her new lover, who then stabbed and decapitated the man.

Police
 don’t believe Daisy Gutierrez helped slay Jose Reyes, but they do think
 she knowingly lured the 30-year-old Honduran to his bloody demise with a
 strip tease on May 21.

They
 also believe she helped her killer lover bury the victim’s body parts 
along with her own father in the family’s Scottsdale area back yard.

Co-conspirators: Daisy Gutierrez, 19, left, is charged with first degree murder for luring a man to his death. Her father Salvador, 56, right, is charged with helping hide the May 21 crime

Both father and daughter made their first court appearance at a Sunday bond hearing.

56-year-old Salvador Gutierrez is charged with concealing a homicide for watching as the unnamed murderer dismembered Reyes’ body.

It was a grisly end to a brutal crime. Prosecutors say Gutierrez’s unnamed new boyfriend smashed in the bedroom door as Gutierrez began to take off her clothes.

He then allegedly stabbed Reyes and hit him with a pipe before decapitating the man, whose official cause of death was ‘multiple sharp force injuries’ and ‘assault.’

Grisly: Police say Jose Reyes, 30, was brutally slain and dismembered by a vengeful new boyfriend of Daisy Gutierrez on May 21

Tricked: The 30-year-old Honduran had moved to the U.S. five years before his brutal murder. Police say he was lured to his death by Daisy Gutierrez

Police say Salvador Gutierrez spent three hours digging a hole in his backyard and watched as the killer placed the body parts in plastic bags into the hole.

Daisy Gutierrez and the still-unnamed killer then fled to New Jersey.

Reyes' body was found by police on Friday after they searched the home. It is unknown what prompted detectives to look for Reyes at the Gutierrez residence.

It is also unclear what prompted Daisy Gutierrez—a mother of three who is also three months pregnant with her new boyfriend’s child—to admit to the crime along with her father.#

Scene: Police say this house on the South Side of Chicago was the site of the unthinkable crime

Buried: Investigators found Reyes' dismembered remains in plastic bags in the backyard. 19-year-old Gutierrez and her father reportedly have admitted to helping facilitate the murder

Her bond was set at $2 million Sunday. Her father’s was set at $500,000.

Sally Daly, a spokeswoman for the Illinois state’s attorney’s office, said that the boyfriend has been taken into custody for questioning in New Jersey. Daly declined to identify him because he had not yet been charged.

Police say they also found human body parts in jars in the house. They have no yet determined whether those remains belong to Reyes or to someone else.

Authorities say Reyes had taken an interest in Daisy Gutierrez. He knew her because two of her young children was with his brother.

Assistant state’s attorney Heather Kent said Gutierrez has a 1-year-old and a 2-year-old with Reyes’ brother.

Relentless: Reyes was the brother of Gutierrez's ex-boyfriend and had apparently taken a liking to the 19-year-old himself before her jealous lover stabbed him, bashed him with a pipe, and sliced his throat

On Sunday, father of those two boys and the grieving brother of the victim spoke for the first time.

'My sons can't stay with people like that,' Jorge Moncada said in Spanish. 'I'm going to fight for them.'

He also said these tragic events are entirely surprising.

'She threatened me and my brother several times, she planned this,' said Moncada.

According to her public defender, Gutierrez’s third child, a three-year-old, is with another man. She is now three months pregnant with the new boyfriend’s child.

Police say Reyes’ attraction to Gutierrez infuriated the new boyfriend.

On May 21, she conspired with the new lover to kill Reyes, police say. She asked her family to leave the house so that she could have Reyes over.

After the killing, she allegedly told her father that she had 'fixed the problem.'

After their arrests on Friday,  Kent says Daisy and Salvador Gutierrez admitted to the crimes in a video recording.

Neighbors of Reyes' are already starting up a collection to help the family repatriate his body to Honduras.

'He was a wonderful person, a really hard worker, really nice. Like a neighbor he always helped,' a neighbor said.
