Tragic:  Namara Whisker, 22, died after a BMW she was travelling in crashed into the River Avon as she travelled home from a night out

A young mother died when the car she was in veered off the road, ploughed through a crash barrier and plunged 20ft into a river.

Namara Whisker, 22, was returning home after a night out with friends when the crash happened early on Saturday.

The silver BMW tore through railings, overturned and then fell into the River Avon shortly after 4am, police said.

At least six police officers dived into the river to save those inside.

Four people escaped from the car relatively unharmed, but Miss Whisker, who gave birth only two months ago, was trapped.

Fire crews managed to free her but she was already dead by the time she was  taken ashore.

Last night, a 33-year-old man was charged with causing death by dangerous driving.

He is also accused of drink- driving and driving without insurance or a licence and was due to appear before Bristol Magistrates’ Court this morning.

A 21-year-old woman from Bristol was also arrested and has been released on police bail.

Friends of Miss Whisker last  night paid tribute to the former business studies student, who is believed to have been in the car’s passenger seat.

They said she had been partying at the Byzantium Bar in Bristol on Friday night and was on her way home when the car left the road.
