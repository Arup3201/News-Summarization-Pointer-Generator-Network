A Seniors Ryder Cup is looking highly likely to be staged for the first time, with golf chiefs from both sides of the Atlantic involved in talks to make it happen.

Setting up an over-50s matchplay tournament between the USA and Europe has been in  discussion for some time, now that the Ryder Cup has become such a major event.

But the impetus has come from the crop of European players newly eligible to play seniors golf, who would ensure a highly competitive event rather than American dominance.

Impetus: Colin Montgomerie, who won the Ryder Cup as a player and captain, is backing the move

These include Colin Montgomerie, who has won two senior majors this year, as well as Sir Nick Faldo, Bernhard Langer, Ian Woosnam,  Sam Torrance and Mark James — all of whom have been European captains in the Ryder Cup.

Ted Bishop, the PGA of America president, said: ‘We are analysing the possibility of hosting a senior Ryder Cup, but there are a lot of moving parts to evaluate.’

George O’Grady, chief executive of the  European Tour, also confirmed discussions were progressing between the stakeholders, but said it was too early to forecast a starting date or definitive format.

The speculation suggests 10-a-side teams, with the first event to be televised by NBC in the United States in September next year.

The Cricketer magazine, having made all three of their editorial staff redundant this week, attempted on Thursday to turn off a new, irreverent, ball-by-ball audio commentary alternative to the BBC’s Test Match Special.

Guerilla Cricket was set up by the Test Match Sofa team, also sidelined by The Cricketer.

Junior operatives from the magazine were sent around to retrieve the Sky viewing card utilised by Test Match Sofa. They went away empty-handed because Guerilla Cricket were using the television facilities of Sports Tonight Live for their Lord’s online commentary.

The relationship between Open organisers the R&A and the European Tour is always spiky.

So something can be read into the European Tour temporary offices at Hoylake being situated next to the caddie shack, while the R&A rooms are in prime position next to the clubhouse.

Beeb’s army at Open

BBC Sport take an army of personnel to every event they cover. The Open is no different with 186 Beeb people employed on their Hoylake operation, significantly more than the 156 golfers competing.

A spokeswoman said: ‘Every member of the team has a clear and accountable role and staff on site work incredibly hard.’

Controversial: Dyson, who broke the rules at the BMW Open in China in October, is part of the BBC team

The BBC radio team includes Simon Dyson as a summariser, despite him being found guilty of breaking the rules in the BMW Masters in China last October when he was judged to have  deliberately tapped down a spike mark.

The R&A might be in a position to announce the successor to retiring chief executive Peter Dawson in September, with headhunters Spencer Stuart having produced a shortlist of candidates.

The search can hardly go worse for Spencer Stuart than their botched eight-month recruitment of a CEO for Ascot racecourse.

The R&A are no respecters of reputation — even when it comes to the august membership of host club Royal Liverpool.

Nick Moss, the financial director of a multi-national company and a former Hoylake committee man, was due to do scoring duties on two days, but was curtly  dismissed by an R&A operative after failing to turn up for a second briefing, not believing it was necessary.

No mercy: The R&A are determined to be fair at this year's Open, and have dismissed Nick Moss

An R&A spokesman said: ‘We can’t have one rule for one and another for everybody else. The meeting was important.’

The disappearance of Bollinger’s champagne tent, an Open institution since 1969, follows the R&A wanting a massive increase in their previous £100,000 licensing agreement.

The R&A are now running the tent — hidden away at Hoylake — on their own.
