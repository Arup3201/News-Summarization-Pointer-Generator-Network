Nurse David Hadfield, who has been found guilty of repeatedly headbutting a seriously ill pensioner at the Royal Blackburn Hospital 

A critical care nurse is facing jail after he was found guilty of repeatedly headbutting a seriously ill pensioner he was meant to be caring for in hospital.

David Hadfield, 54, struck 72-year-old Thomas Bretherton in the centre of his forehead three times while he was being treated at the Royal Blackburn Hospital.

The pensioner, who was confused and having trouble breathing, was attacked after he became distressed when Hadfield changed his sheets.

Today the jury at Preston Crown Court found Hadfield guilty of unlawful wounding, prompting cries from the public gallery from his family.

Hadfield, who will be sentenced next month, showed no emotion as the verdict was read out and shook his head as he left the dock after the judge warned him he will face jail.

Mr Bretherton, who was left with three cuts to his head, had been admitted to hospital in August last year after being diagnosed with acute pancreatits and Hadfield was assigned to look after him.

During the four-day trial, Tim Storrie, prosecuting, explained: 'Thomas Bretherton was struck more than once causing wounds to open on his head after he was repeatedly headbutted.'

Hadfield had claimed that Mr Bretherton became 'confused and paranoid' as he tried to change his sheets and says that the grandfather-of-five headbutted him.

But giving evidence at court, his colleague Leanne Whittaker, a staff nurse, said: 'This was a very poorly patient. He wouldn’t have had the energy to move himself forward.

'I was stood at the nurses’ station and I was alerted that there was shouting.

'It got louder and then I heard something like "shut up and lie down. It was a man’s voice.

'I put the monitor on so I could see what was going on and it looked like Hadfield threw himself forcefully into the patient.

'He did this three times and made contact three times with the patient’s forehead.

'I shouted out "that is absolutely disgusting" and everybody was shocked.'

Pensioner Thomas Bretherton was being treated by Hadfield at a ward at the Royal Blackburn Hospital when he was attacked 

The court was told Mr Bretherton had been calm and sleeping when Hadfield entered the room at around midnight during a night shift to change his sheets.

Caroline Piper, another colleague who gave evidence during the trial, had been standing 40 feet away when the incident happened on August 6.

She said: 'The patient was lying at a 45 degree angle.

'His hands were being held and so he was trying to sit forward.

'He did lunge forward with his head but he did not make contact with David.

'He wasn’t near enough to make contact.

Today, Hadfield, was found guilty of assault at Preston Crown Court, pictured, and was warned he will face jail 

'David then lunged with his head towards the patient and I saw their heads clash.

'David lunged towards him three times.

'I was stunned and baffled by what I saw and I couldn’t make sense of it.' 

Mr Bretherton died shortly after the alleged attack, although his passing was not related at all to the incident.

Judge Simon Newell said: 'Given the nature of the assault and the circumstances which are well known to all of us, you are likely to be given a custodial sentence.'

Hadfield was released on bail until he is sentenced on November 25.
