Britain has just five scanners to detect stowaways trying to enter the country in lorries through our 29 ports, it can be revealed.

There is mounting concern about security at our borders with 2,500 illegal immigrants camped in Calais trying to reach the UK.

The UK Border Force budget fell by 20 per cent last year, raising fears about the ability to detect attempts by foreigners to smuggle themselves across the Channel in cars, trucks and trailers.

The Home Office has admitted that it has only five Passive Millimetre Wave Imaging devices which scan vehicles for the presence of ‘clandestines’ before they reach the UK's 29 ports

Ministers have been forced to admit that despite there being 51 points of entry into the UK at 29 ports for foreign vehicles, there are just five scanners in operation in France checking vehicles before they leave for Britain.

The so-called Passive Millimetre Wave Imaging devices scan vehicles for the presence of ‘clandestines’. Each scanner costs around £800,000 to buy, and £83 to run for 24 hours.

With so few devices available, there are concerns that they are not used in some areas because they risk causing queues of lorries to build up, making it easier for stowaways to climb into the backs of lorries.

The figures were unearthed by Tory MP Steven Barclay in a series of parliamentary questions.

He told MailOnline that it raised serious questions about the security of the UK’s borders.

He said: ‘It is very concerning that the UK Border Force budget has been cut and there are so few machines to scan vehicles at a time when we know our points of entry, particularly at Calais, are under such pressure.

‘When Parliament is being asked to vote on the European Arrest Warrant we need to demonstrate that everything possible is being done at our borders to prevent illegal entry into the country.

‘The significant increase in illegal entrants identified over the last year illustrates the urgency in resourcing border controls effectively.’

He highlighted figures show that the Border Force budget was cut by 20 per cent from £596million in 2012-13 to £467million last year. 

The Home Office confirmed that the five Passive Millimetre Imaging devices are ‘located at the juxtaposed controls’ in France and are used for ‘detecting clandestines in soft sided vehicles’.

There are a further 19 body-scanners which individuals must walk through, which are used to detect drugs.

The Home Office said that last year the Border Force detected and prevented 18,000 attempts to enter the UK illegally before they left the continent, a 62 per cent rise on the previous year.

Growing numbers of migrants have been trying to enter the UK through Calais in recent months.

Last week Bernard Cazeneuve, the French interior minister, called for Britain send police to Calais to deal with the port's 'tremendous problem' with illegal immigration.

Calais' mayor Natacha Bouchart told MPs that Britain was seen as an ‘El Dorado’ for migrants – and many were prepared to die to make the journey.

Blaming the UK for the crisis, Miss Bouchart said lavish benefits and the prospect of illegal work and accommodation were magnets for immigrants determined to get across the English Channel.

She said illegal migrants, many fleeing humanitarian disasters in Africa and the Middle East, were ‘prepared to die’ to reach Britain, believing it to be like the mythical lost city of gold, El Dorado.

British taxpayers will be contributing to a new £2.35 million a year welcome centre for UK-bound illegal migrants in Calais.

The bill will be added to the £12million the British government has already pledged to the French to improve security in the port town this year.

Hauliers face stiff penalties of thousands of pounds if they are caught with illegal immigrants hiding in their lorries.

If they are carrying food or crops in their lorries, the cargo is often condemned, leaving them further out of pocket.

The Road Haulage Association has urged the Home Office to do more to increase truck speeds through ports ‘in order to reduce boarding times, and limit the opportunities for illegals to board vehicles’.

A Home Office spokesperson said: “Security at the UK border is our priority and Border Force employs a number of cutting-edge techniques to detect clandestines.

‘These include the use of body scanners, imaging devices, sniffer dogs, carbon dioxide detectors, heartbeat monitors and scanners - in addition to officers conducting visual searches.

“Last year, our officials detected and prevented 18,000 clandestines entering the UK illegally and we will continue to strengthen our border to stop those who have no right to enter the UK.”

Tomorrow MPs will vote on Britain being part of the European Arrest Warrant, which makes it easier for criminals to be deported between EU countries to face justice.

The controversial power is one of 35 European Union police and criminal justice measures the  Government wants to opt back in to, with MPs expected to vote on the package as a whole. 

The Tory leadership faces a revolt from dozens of Tory MPs,who could defy the party leadership to oppose the measure because of concerns that it is too easy for UK citizens to be extradited on relatively minor charges to countries where they may have no guarantee of a fair trial. 

Home Secretary Theresa May today issued a direct plea for MPs to back the EAW. 'If we want to stop foreign criminals from coming to Britain, deal with European fighters coming back from Syria, stop British criminals evading justice abroad, prevent foreign criminals evading justice by hiding here, and get foreign criminals out of our prisons, these measures are vital.

'Tomorrow evening, the House of Commons should vote to give the police, prosecutors and other law enforcement agencies the powers they need to keep us safe.'

Tory backbencher David Davis accused Mrs May of 'scaremongering' with her claims the (EAW) would lead to Britain becoming a 'honeypot' for fugitives. 

Writing in the Sunday Times Mr Davis said: 'It is better to take a few weeks longer to return a terrorist to British justice than to take three years longer to recover a British citizen from a foreign injustice.

'The warnings that Britain will become a safe haven for criminals is an example of the sort of scaremongering that has become far too prevalent in the debates on justice and anti-terrorism measures.

'The UK was certainly no safe haven prior to the introduction of the EAW.'
