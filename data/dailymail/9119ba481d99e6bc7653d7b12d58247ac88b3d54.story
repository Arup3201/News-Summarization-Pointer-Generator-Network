Google is to be hit with a multi-million pound bill as the taxman steps up the fight against aggressive tax dodging in Britain.

The American internet giant is expected to pay at least £24million in backdated tax following a review of its operations by HM Revenue & Customs.

It follows an angry backlash against the company over its tiny tax bill.

Google is to be hit with a multi-million pound bill as the taxman steps up the fight against tax dodging

Google paid just £11.6million in corporation tax in Britain in 2012 despite sales here of £3billion and profits of nearly £900million.

Other multinational companies have also come under fire for reducing their tax bills including Starbucks, Amazon and Facebook.

HMRC and the government have been criticised for pursuing small companies and individuals over their tax affairs but letting powerful corporations off the hook.

Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who chairs the public accounts committee of MPs, has accused ministers of ‘presiding over a seemingly growing tax bonanza for global internet companies’.

She said it was ‘extremely depressing’ to see global companies failing to pay their fair share of UK tax.

Firms including Google and other tech giants have set up intricate global structures involving low tax regimes which mean they can legally reduce the amount of tax they pay in the UK.

Google funnels much of the business it does in Britain through Ireland but also uses Bermuda to help lower its overall tax bill further.

But with a review launched in 2010 by HMRC into Google’s finances close to completion, the company now faces paying £24million in backdated taxes.

The charge relates to shares given to Google staff in London and the way such share-based pay is treated for tax purposes.

Google’s 2,000 staff in London are given shares each year by the US parent company. The shares were worth £51million in 2011 and £50million in 2012.

In the past, the payments have been used to help lower the company’s UK tax bill but a crackdown by HMRC has seen the rules change.

Google has already set aside £24million to cover the extra corporation tax it expects it will owe for 2005 to 2011.

It said it is ‘a matter the company is discussing with HMRC’.

Heather Self, a tax expert at Pinsent Mason law firm, said: ‘The government clarified the rules on tax deductions for share schemes to make it clear that aggressive positions taken by some companies would not be tolerated for the future.’

A spokesman for HMRC said: ‘HMRC does not discuss the affairs of individual companies, but we ensure that multinationals pay the tax due in accordance with UK tax law.

‘We man-mark the most complex and potentially high risk businesses and, since 2010, we have collected over £23billion in extra tax through challenging large businesses’ tax arrangements.

'We relentlessly pursue businesses which don’t play by the rules and these results reflect this.’

Google said: ‘Like most multinationals, we pay the bulk of our corporate tax bill where our business originated - in our case the US. We’re a significant contributor to the UK economy having created over 2,000 jobs.
