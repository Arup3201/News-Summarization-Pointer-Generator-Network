I’m standing in Top Shop as jostling customers browse for handbags and flick through rails of summer dresses. They are not looking at me, but I am watching them.

In fact, I am photographing them, taking video clips and wiring them back to the office. I make a call without lifting a finger. I send a discreet email. But I attract no attention because the camera, the screen and the phone are virtually invisible. They are just a tiny component of my high-tech glasses.

I am looking at the future and the people around me are oblivious. The long-awaited but controversial Google Glass has arrived in Britain, and I am testing what it can do – and not just in terms of making calls or capturing high-quality snaps to show my friends. I am also seeing how it stretches long-cherished ideas of privacy to breaking point. And beyond.

'Okay Glass': Claudia Joseph manages to prowl London's streets, banks and cinemas wearing Google Glass virtually undetected, filming and taking pictures as she goes

Today we are fearful of terrorists, alert for paedophiles and edgy about the all-consuming surveillance of major corporations and the state. We have never been so conscious of snooping and spying.

Yet I have been in the law courts, loitered outside a primary school, queued for changing rooms, snooped around a bank – and with one exception only, my strange new glasses have provoked not so much as a glance of enquiry.

The attractions of immediate communication and instant imagery are powerful; human knowledge is expanding at an unimaginable rate. But from smartphones to drones the size of insects, the pace of electronic change is now so overwhelming that experts predict a reshaping of society itself – a dystopian world in which our thoughts and movements are forever available to close family and strangers alike. A world with no private space.

Google Glass is at the forefront of this revolution – futuristic technology that has burst out of the laboratory and gone on sale.

The price, £1,000, is stiff but like most new technology will probably fall. A voice-activated cross between a smartphone and a pair of spectacles, it can take photos and videos, make phone and video calls, surf the internet, send emails, listen to music and update your diary, all while you barely twitch a muscle.

Happy snapper: Claudia is able to film while waiting in line at a cash point on London's Oxford Circus

Welcome to Britain: The privacy-invading Goggle glasses have now arrived in the UK at a price of £1,000

At their new Kings Cross headquarters, Google staff show me how to use the  new device. Key to its operation is the screen, a tiny translucent prism suspended above the right eye. You swipe on the side of the frame to  activate it and dictate commands starting with the words: ‘Okay Glass.’

Everything is saved on a timeline, 
which is found by swiping forwards and backwards. To go back to the 
menu, you scroll downwards. The  battery lasts about a day, or 45 
minutes for non-stop video recording.

I’m
 a little nervous wearing them for the first time, but no one takes a  
second glance as I take the tube to Oxford Circus, in London’s West End.

There is nothing obviously private on
 view in Top Shop. But what about the changing rooms? Would my fellow 
shoppers be uneasy at the recording device perched on my nose?

Apparently not. I am unchallenged – it’s a good job this isn’t an open changing room, like at the gym.

What about more sensitive locations? 
Would bank staff spot me if I tried to film inside a branch where 
security is supposedly tight? First I film a cashpoint queue outside 
HSBC, then I go inside. They seem oblivious. ‘Can I help you?’ they ask,
 before guiding me to the tills. So much for security.

Surely
 there would be more vigilance at a primary school – the sort of place 
where parents have found themselves banned from filming their  own 
children at sports days. I sit outside the entrance and watch through 
the glasses as the children arrive. I am barely noticed.

My
 local cinema pays no attention when I catch a screening of the newly 
released Jersey Boys. Wearing the glasses, I buy a ticket, sit down and 
decide to film the opening credits.

At
 least Google Glass is visible, unlike the tiny surveillance cameras now
 available online, although the time will come when high-tech specs are 
indistinguishable from any other pair of glasses. In fact, the time will
 come when almost anything could contain a recording device. 

Pin-ned down: Google Glass is so discreet no one notices, allowing Claudia to capture images of people using the cash machine unchallenged

Taking the credit: No questions were raised when Claudia wore the Google Glass to a screening at her local cinema, so she could record the opening credits undiscovered

I take matters a step further, and 
visit a magistrates’ court, choosing a seat in the public gallery. The 
rules here are draconian: there must be no pictures or filming or 
recording. So I keep Google Glass switched off. But magistrates, 
lawyers, clerks and ushers pay no attention to my headwear.

Only
 the Royal Courts of Justice were on the ball. The metal detector in the
 foyer fails to pick up Google Glass. But as I begin to walk in, a guard
 turns to me and says: ‘Is that a camera? You will have to leave those 
here, if you want to go in.’

I am bang to rights – for once.

Google
 claims the glasses bring people the technology they need ‘without 
distracting them from the world around them’. Glass has been featured in
 Vogue’s fashion pages, attracted the porn industry (Google banned an 
app called Tits and Glass), been spoofed by the Simpsons (as the Oogle 
Goggles) and worn by Prince Charles and Sarah Jessica Parker.

There is no doubting the radical 
potential. Shafi Ahmed, a surgeon at the Royal London Hospital, 
broadcast live video of him operating to 13,000 medical students using 
Google’s specs.

But they are also thought to be behind the footage of One Direction’s Zayn Malik apparently lighting up a joint.

In America, some shops and cafes have banned the device, while critics have branded wearers ‘glassholes’.

Google has released an etiquette guide
 stating, rather obviously, that ‘standing alone in the corner of a room
 staring at people while recording them through Glass is not going to 
win you any friends’.

'Take them off': Although the Courts of Justice metal detector failed to recognise the glasses, officials were quick to spot the camera

‘We designed Glass with privacy in mind,’ says a Google spokeswoman.‘The fact that Glass is worn above 
the eyes and the screen lights up when it is activated clearly signals 
it is in use and makes it a fairly lousy surveillance device.

'There are other ways to record people such as pin cameras. Glass isn’t one of them.’

She is right. There are tiny 
remote-control drones that can manoeuvre like an insect, and contact 
lenses, under development by Google, that are capable of taking photos.

Driverless
 cars will record our every journey. Computerised watches, already in 
development, will monitor our state of health. Fridges will inform a 
central computer when we’re low on milk.

Finally stopped: Only at the Royal Courts of Justice is Claudia asked to remove her glasses

At a more basic level, cloud technology can already let friends,  family – and hackers – know where you are and what you’re up to. And while it is heartening to know we can be tracked and rescued by mobile phone signals, it also means we are never truly alone.

Odd behaviour, curious facial expressions, stray looks – these are increasingly captured and broadcast in myriad forums, from Facebook to YouTube. Imagine that five-fold – or 25-fold.

And we already spy on those closest to us. Forty-four per cent of spouses now secretly check each other’s text messages, according to Oxford University research, behaviour that would once have been seen as a serious breach of privacy.

Neuroscientist Professor Susan Greenfield warns that human identity itself is under threat as electronic devices cause changes in the brain’s microcellular structure.

‘It’s pretty clear that the screen-based, two-dimensional world that so many teenagers – and a growing number of adults – choose to inhabit is producing changes in behaviour.

Attention spans are shorter, personal communication skills are reduced and there’s a marked reduction in the ability to think abstractly,’ she has said.

And that can affect even our closest relationships. ‘Google Glass raises the spectre of society’s loss of privacy, since you never know when someone might be videotaping or recording you,’ says Benita Roth, professor of sociology at Binghamton University, New York.

‘A huge concern is the lack of  control people have over their own persona, as your online identity becomes an agglomeration of people you know, products you have bought and websites you have visited, leaving a digital trail followed by data-hungry corporations.’

In Dave Eggers’s recent bestseller The Circle, his characters’ every move is videoed and streamed live. Only the toilet cubicle is spared the camera’s all-seeing eye.

Is his fiction so far from the future we now face?
