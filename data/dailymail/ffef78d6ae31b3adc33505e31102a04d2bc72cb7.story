A happy dog ready to jump up and give you a kiss, a coffee-related accident and a broken egg - it looks like a photo exhibition, but these images are all drawn by hand.

Heroically named artist Ivan Hoo, from Singapore, earns a living from his realistic drawings and paintings that look like photographs.

The 31-year-old takes up to three days to complete the impressive pieces, which include animal portraits and still life drawings of everyday items such as a Starbucks cup.

The sketches are completed using a range of soft pastel pencils and are drawn from still life, or from a photograph taken by Ivan himself.

Mr Hoo said: 'Art is my job as well as my passion and I feel lucky to be able to devote myself to drawing and painting.

'I have always loved drawing ever since I was a child but I never studied art and am completely self-taught.

'Then about four or five years ago I decided to further my knowledge in drawing techniques - in particular realism - and work full time as an artist. Pastels have always been my favourite medium to work with.

'All of my work starts with a basic pencil sketch and I compose my own subjects and either take a photograph or draw from still life.'
