No X-ray needed here: Corinne Theile poses in her bikini at LAX in protest of TSA security checks

It’s been a year since Californian holidaymaker Corinne Theile first stripped down to her bikini at Los Angeles International Airport in protest of ‘invasive’ security screening.

And to mark the anniversary, the 32-year-old returned to the airport in a two-piece once more, declaring that she’ll continue to do so even when she’s 80.

Corinne, dubbed the ‘Bikini Girl’, has worn her swimsuit on seven flights over the past 12 months in dispute of TSA full body scanners.

Miss Theile believes that the scanners release low levels of radiation and she said yesterday: ‘If I’m 80 and I can go through security in a bikini, I’ll do it.’

Instead of using TSA (Transportation Security Administration) security checks, which include the use of backscatter X-ray and millimetre wave detection, Corinne would rather wear her bikini so security officers can see she has nothing to hide.

The enhanced X-ray screening procedures were brought into effect at all U.S. airports in November last year to allow security officers to detect both metal and non-metal weapons hidden in passengers’ clothing.

TSA officials said the heightened security measures were introduced in reaction to the ‘underwear bomber’ who smuggled plastic explosives onto a flight leaving Amsterdam’s Schipol Airport en route to the U.S. in 2009.

But when the new security checks were brought in last year, many Americans were left furious at the rigid rules.

Corinne told local media outside LAX last November: ‘I feel like the TSA is making travellers feel uncomfortable, and I feel like we can have security measures that don’t make people feel uncomfortable.

‘Every time I go through security I always say, ‘’I don’t even know why I got dressed this morning.’’ I end up taking off belts, jewellery and everything else off anyway.

‘I don’t want to do a body scan and I’m hoping by wearing a bikini they will see everything they need to see and we can avoid a pat-down, as well.’

And joining Corinne in her protest last November at airports around the U.S. were a small group of fellow passengers who stripped down to their underwear to demonstrate their opinions.

One male passenger, named only as Jimmy, arrived at Salt Lake City Airport in a pair of Speedos with body paint written on his back that spelled out the words: ‘Screw Big Sis’.

And an aspiring porn-star filmed herself stripping to her underwear at Seattle-Tacoma Airport and told TSA officials that she was ‘going to enjoy this experience as much as I can instead of being scared and humiliated like the TSA wants me to be.’

A TSA spokesperson said at the time that the agency, which works with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, must balance people’s demands for privacy with the need to protect passengers from terror threats.

While New York Mayor Michael Boomberg urged travellers to get over their outrage about the body scanners and patdowns saying it is necessary in the ‘dangerous world we life in.’

He said: ‘We have to stop all this shilly-shallying and understand if you want to be safe on air planes we have to make sure that we keep you safe.’
