Officials from the U.S. Coast Guard and the British Royal Fleet announced Tuesday that the two nautical organizations had collaborated on an enormous cocaine bust in the Caribbean Sea that both agencies describe as historic.

In all, officers unloaded more than 2,500 pounds of cocaine off of the Sitkinak cutter Tuesday morning that was discovered on a boat just off the coast of the Dominican Republic in the early morning hours of January 22.

The haul: Officials say they discovered more than 2,500 pounds of cocaine on a boat in the Caribbean Sea last week

Smugglers: Officials say they say a speed boat with packages on its deck on January 22 just south of the Dominican Republic

Ditched: The smugglers started throwing bricks of cocaine into the ocean once they realize they'd been spotted

Authorities say the cocaine recovered has a street value of more than $37 million.

Officials say officers aboard the 110-foot island class Sitkinak spotted a 25-foot go-fast boat with two outboard engines racing along the Dominican Republic's southern coast.

According to  U.S. Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Gabe Somma, there were 'very visible packages on the deck.'

Seized: Wave Knight then launched its own small boat with a US Coast Guard team to board and question the suspects

Value: The 1.25 tonnes of the Class A drug had a UK wholesale value of more than £60 million, but the street value would have topped £300million

Weight: Authorities found about 45 prepackaged bricks of cocaine floating in the sea in the wake of the smugglers' boat

Pricey: Authorities estimate that the 2,500 pounds of cocaine is worth more than $37 million

Coast Guard officials then notified the British ship Wave Knight - which also was in the area - about the suspected smugglers.

The smugglers - knowing they'd been discovered - began dumping the 45 prepackaged bricks of cocaine into the ocean.

However, a Coast Guard helicopter already had been deployed from the deck of the Wave Knight and the drugs were recovered.

Cooperation: Authorities say the bust is the first time a U.S. helicopter has been launched from a British ship

Haul: More than a tonne of cocaine worth more than £60million from a speedboat in the Caribbean in an operation involving the Royal Navy

According to the Miami Herald, four men were taken into custody. They later were handed over to federal law enforcement officials. 

The U.S. and British fleets have been participating in joint operations in the Caribbean for several years, but the January 22 bust was the first time a U.S. ship was launched from a British ship.
