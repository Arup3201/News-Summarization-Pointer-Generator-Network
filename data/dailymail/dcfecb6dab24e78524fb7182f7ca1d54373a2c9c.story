While swingers aren't exactly likely to do it themselves, not with real names anyway, the Spice European Lifestyle Awards are shouting about the evening escapades of this surprisingly popular sub-culture from the rooftops.

Finalists for the awards honouring the best in Euro swinging - the first of their kind - have been unveiled with the best clubs, travel agents, fashion labels and outlets, and more being honoured.

For the team from Spice Lanzarote, the ‘adult’ resort that markets itself as a ‘paradise for naturists, libertines and genuinely curious couples', swinging is anything but taboo and goes far beyond plucking car keys in a bowl.

The hotel and entertainment complex embraces sexual freedom and with the awards they're keen to honour those who make the lives of those engaged in 'The Lifestyle' - the preferred blanket term for swinging-related terms including but not limited to libertines, partner swapping and 'open' relationships - that little bit better.

The finalists for best lifestyle club including London-based Ab Fab Parties, facing stiff competition from the Netherland's Fun4Two, Spain's Oops!, Germany's Schloss Milkersdorf and Italy's Fashion Club. 

The finalists have been decided by swingers across Europe who are among Spice's 5,000-member online community - they will decide the majority of the winners in categories that also include best lifestyle blog and best lifestyle fashion label.

An exception has been made for the 
best lifestyle couple photograph gong, the judging of which has been 
handed over to the professionals, London-based boudoir photographers 
Faby and Carlo.

'That 
Twitter avatar of your backside will not cut it this time, this is an 
art award, we want your best looks, not out of focus images of your 
un-groomed extremities,' the organisers say.

Anyone
 can get involved in the voting process by registering at 
www.europeanlifestyleawards.com, with all participants entered into a 
draw to win one of five all-inclusive holidays for two to Spice 
Lanzarote.

Spice director 
Tracy Isted said: 'The lifestyle is hugely misunderstood and awards such
 as this can bring greater awareness and consideration to our sector, 
one that is not representative of, dare I say, the more traditional 
adult entertainment industry.

'People
 from all over the world come to Spice - successful, professional 
couples who want to try something less ordinary, from experienced 
swingers to curious couples, our community is vast but they tend not to 
shout about it from their rooftops of course, so hopefully these awards 
can do some shouting for them!

'We get hundreds of inquiries daily from new couples looking to their first lifestyle experience.'

Voting continues until October 30 with the winners to be crowned during a series of celebratory events at Spice Lanzarote throughout December.
