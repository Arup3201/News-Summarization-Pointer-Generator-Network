President Barack Obama has paid tribute to America's fallen soldiers in a moving Memorial Day speech at Arlington National Cemetery - as he urged the nation not to forget the tens of thousands of troops still protecting the country in Afghanistan.

'Let us never forgot to always remember the sacrifice they make in our name,' he said at the final resting place for many of America's war heroes.

'Today most Americans are not directly touched by war, as a consequence not all Americans may always fully grasp the depths of sacrifice - the profound costs that are made in our name,' he said. 'Our troops, our military families understand this and they mention to me whether the country fully appreciates what is happening. Let us never forget that our nation is still at war.'

He suggested fewer people are today touched by war due to the all-volunteer military force and advanced technology that allows the U.S. to accomplish some missions with far fewer personnel.

But he reminded the nation not to forget the 60,000 troops who are still fighting in Afghanistan.

'Fewer Americans are making the ultimate
sacrifice in Afghanistan, and thatâ€™s progress for which we are 
profoundly grateful,' Obama said. 'This time next year, we will mark the
final Memorial Day of our war in Afghanistan.'

In his speech, he said that Arlington
National Cemetery 'has always been home to men and women who are 
willing to give their all ... to preserve and protect the land that we 
love'. He also praised the character and selflessness that 'beats in the hearts' of America's troops.

Before his address, Obama honored the nation's fallen military service members by laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns in a somber ceremony at the cemetery.

He rode by motorcade from the White House to the hallowed burial grounds in suburban Virginia on a sun-splashed, but cool spring holiday as cannon fire was heard in the distance.

Surrounded by officials and families of service members, he carried out the Memorial Day tradition before reflecting silently on the lives lost to battle as he held his hand held to his chest.

In his speech, Obama mentioned a handful of troops by name who were buried at Arlington after losing their lives in Afghanistan.

Among
these was 27-year-old Capt. Sara Cullen, a West Point graduate and 
Black Hawk helicopter pilot, who died after a crash during a training 
mission near Kandahar.

He also paid tribute to Staff Sgt. Frankie Phillips, a combat medic who was killed by a roadside bomb while on patrol.

'He
was so humble that his parents never knew how many lives he had saved 
until soldiers started showing up at his funeral from thousands of miles
away,' Obama said.

Finally,
he mentioned Staff Sgt. Eric Christian, who served five tours of duty 
because he 'was determined to finish the mission.' He was killed 
escorting a U.S. official to meet with Afghan leaders and buried just 
six days ago.

Obama was joined by Defense Secretary 
Chuck Hagel, cemetery Executive Director Kathryn Condon and Maj. Gen. 
Michael Linnington, commander of the Army's military district of 
Washington.

This is Obama's fourth Memorial Day 
wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington Cemetery during his presidency. In 
2010, he was in Chicago and Vice President Joe Biden participated in his
place.

The presentation came after first lady Michelle Obama hosted a breakfast at the White House with 'Gold Star' families of service 
members who have been killed.

As he attended the event at Arlington, families marked Memorial Day at cemeteries, memorials and monuments across
the country. The events come at a time when combat in Afghanistan 
approaches 12 years and the ranks of World War II veterans dwindles.

In
one of several ceremonies honoring Americans killed in Afghanistan, the
city of South Sioux City, Nebraska, planned to unveil a statue honoring
Navy Petty Officer 1st Class John Douangdara, a dog handler for the 
SEALs killed in a 2011 helicopter crash.

His service dog was also killed in the crash and is memorialized beside him in the statue.

At
the American Airpower Museum on Long Island, New York, a program was 
planned to honor Women Air Service Pilots, or WASPs, who tested and 
ferried completed aircraft from factories to bases during World War II.

Thirty-eight
died during the war, including Alice Lovejoy of Scarsdale, New York, 
who was killed on September 13, 1944, in a midair collision over Texas.

'It's very important that we 
recognize not only their contribution to American history, but women's 
history,' said Julia Lauria-Blum, curator of the WASP exhibit at the 
museum.

'These women really
blazed a path; they were pioneers for women's aviation. And most 
important, they gave their lives serving their country and must be 
honored like anyone else on Memorial Day.'

Another
wreath-laying ceremony was planned at Franklin D. Roosevelt Four 
Freedoms Park on the southern tip of Roosevelt Island in New York City.

The
park is a tribute to President Roosevelt's famous speech calling for 
all people to enjoy freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from 
want and freedom from fear.

In Atlanta, a dedication of the 
History Center's redone Veterans Park was scheduled for early evening. 
Soil from major battlefields will be scattered by veterans around the 
park's flagpole.

In 
suburban Boston, veterans gathered in a park to mark Memorial Day this 
year rather than hold a parade because of failing health and dwindling 
numbers.

The city of 
Beverly called off its parade because so few veterans would be able to 
march. The parade has been a fixture in the town since the Civil War.

The holiday weekend also marked the 
traditional start of the U.S. vacation season. AAA, one of the nation's 
largest leisure travel agencies, expected 31.2 million Americans to hit 
the road over the weekend, virtually the same number as last year. Gas prices were about the same as last year, up 1 cent to a national average of $3.65 a gallon Friday.
