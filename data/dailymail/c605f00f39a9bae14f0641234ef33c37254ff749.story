Travelers are no stranger to the US airport security line in which passengers are required to put personal belongings in plastic tubs to be scanned by security machines.

According to the Transportation Security Administration, when travelers take back their belongings they leave loose change behind--lots of it.

Bloomberg Businessweek reports that more than $500,000 worth of change was left in security tubs in the last fiscal year.

Change from travelers belongings going through airport security added up to over $500,000 this year

The L.A. Times reports that $32,000 of the coins left behind are foreign currency.

The $531,395 of coins TSA collected from airports last year was put in an 'aviation security fund' and spent on airport security and on signs translated into foreign languages for international travelers.

Some members of Congress think that the money should go to the military.

Jeff Miller, a Republican representative from Florida, just put forth a bill in attempt to have TSA collect the funds for rest and relaxation stations in airports for military officers and their families.Â 

Florida Republican Rep. Jeff Miller thinks the money should go to rest stations for military personnel and their families

His bill would require non-profit organizations dedicated to helping veterans bid for money. The only eligible non-profit that currently has a national presence is the United Service Organization. The 72-year-old service organization has rest centers in 44 U.S. airports.

The bill was approved last week and is under review by the House of Representatives.

An earlier version of the bill would have cost $1 million to implement.

The new version wont cost as much because it wont touch funds the TSA already collected, the Congressional Budget Office discovered earlier this week.

'I was pretty aggravated that they said it was going to cost money to give money away,' said Miller.

'Travelers' lost change is unappropriated dollars that should be put to good use,' he said during a Homeland Security Committee meeting in October.
