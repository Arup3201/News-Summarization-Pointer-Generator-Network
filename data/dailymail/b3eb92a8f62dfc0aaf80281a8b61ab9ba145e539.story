In the end, it took an Old West method for demolition workers to topple the final tower left standing after a Las Vegas casino implosion.

The 13-hour saga came to a close after the building was lassoed with steel cables attached to a crane that then pulled and pulled until the elevator shaft of the Clarion hotel-casino came tumbling down. 

'The building is finally down,' site owner Lorenzo Doumani announced late yesterday afternoon.  

More than 4,000 pounds of explosives were used to demolish the Clarion before sunrise Tuesday.

Demolition workers toppled the final tower left standing in the Las Vegas Clarion hotel-casino implosion by using a 'lasso trick' with a crane that was reminiscent of the Old West  

 After the first explosion, the concrete block structure (pictured here after finally getting pulled down) had dropped four stories and was left standing at a height of 100 feet

Crews had to use cables and a crane because no wrecking balls were immediately available and the the remainder of the building, which was leaning, was considered a safety hazard

After the dust cleared, the concrete block structure had dropped four stories and was left standing at a height of 100 feet. 

There were no wrecking balls immediately available and the the remainder of the building, which was leaning, was considered a safety hazard. 

So crews went to their Plan B - cables and a crane, as seen on a video posted to YouTube. 

The 12-story Clarion casino-hotel, which opened its doors in 1970 and was briefly owned by actress Debbie Reynolds, became the 13th hotel to gain implosion infamy in Sin City. 

Ready to rumble: With the sound of slot machines blurring out the noise, more than 4,000 pounds of explosives were used to demolish a Las Vegas hotel early Tuesday

Steeped in history: The 200-room casino-hotel first opened as the Royal Inn and was called the Debbie Reynolds - for its one-time owner

Behind-the-scenes: The implosion required several months of planning and 4,400 pounds of explosives, said Anthony O. Schlecht, safety coordinator for Las Vegas-based Burke Construction

Dust everywhere: Preparation for the demolition extended to covering nearby pools, including at the neighboring Marriott hotel 

Doumani, a developer who purchased the property in October for $22.5 million in cash, plans to build a 60-story hotel tower that could be the tallest occupied building on the Strip.

There would be no condos or casino.

'Instead of trying to compete with everybody, you have to have something unique,' he said.

And that uniqueness could involve catering to convention-goers, including incorporating untraditional office-space to appeal to companies that frequent Las Vegas for conventions.

He said he hopes to have a plan in place by the end of the year and doesn't expect any kind of opening before 2018. 

Doumani said he'll be posting updates to 305CCD.com including video of Tuesday's implosion. 

He watched the demolition - which lasted around ten seconds - with his family. 

After listening to a pre-implosion soundtrack of Frank Sinatra the group, flanked by two showgirls, did a countdown to the Clarion's final seconds at nearly 3am, 

The 200-room casino-hotel first opened as the Royal Inn and was called the Debbie Reynolds - for its one-time owner - as well as the Greek Isles and the Paddle Wheel.

Amanda Dickerson had never stayed at the Clarion or any of its incarnations, but she reveled in its demise early Tuesday morning after traveling from Ripon, Wisconsin, to check an unlikely item off her life's bucket list: witness a building implosion in person.

'We don't do this in Wisconsin,' she said after the dust had almost settled. 'It was truly amazing.'

Dickerson, 35, her boyfriend Pete Kuhn, 38, and Las Vegas local Cherie DeWilde, who first alerted her friend to the impending implosion, had been scoping out the casino-hotel earlier Monday when they got to talking with the construction crew. 

After telling their tale, the trio earned an exclusive invite to watch the building crumble from across the street alongside the developer, his family, friends and members of the press.

'It was one of the best experiences of my life,' Dickerson said. Pointing to the leftover rubble, Kuhn joked that it resembled something else.

'That also looks like our wallet this week,' he said.

What took seconds to destroy required several months of planning and 4,400 pounds of explosives, said Anthony O. Schlecht, safety coordinator for Las Vegas-based Burke Construction who said the preparation extended to covering nearby pools, including at the neighboring Marriott hotel.

It's been a while since a casino-hotel was felled by controlled explosives. 

Between 2004 and 2007, six Vegas properties were brought down, but in the eight years since, the only Strip-side implosions were the segment of the Tropicana and a parking structure.

The Clarion was no marquee property on the scale of a Stardust, which was imploded eight years ago, or a Dunes, which made way for the Bellagio.

'It's a little harder to gin up the same degree of interest,' said University of Nevada, Las Vegas history professor Michael Green of the Clarion's less noteworthy impending implosion.

Doumani said he knows this isn't a landmark property.

Perhaps appropriately, Doumani watched the implosion of the casino-hotel he bought last year from a parking lot that paved over the spot where the Landmark casino-hotel once stood, before it was demolished in 1995.

Instead the Clarion, off the Strip across from the area's convention center, has had several names and had fallen into bankruptcy nearly as many times, he said.

'It is not a storied site,' he said.

He said it was the building itself, and rooms that resembled cubicles, that didn't work, not the location.

Its proximity both to the Strip and to the convention center appealed to Doumani. He will now work on financing the rebuild as he waits for nearby development to come to fruition.
