Ryan Matthews, pictured centre, has been remanded in custody accused of the murder of healthcare worker Sharon Wall

A man has been remanded in custody accused of the murder of a healthcare assistant who died after being stabbed while at work in a psychiatric hospital.

Ryan Matthews, 61, of Wotton Lawn hospital, Horton Road, Gloucester, faced magistrates in Cheltenham charged with Sharon Wall's murder.

He spoke only to confirm his name, address, date of birth and that he understood the charge he faces during the three minute hearing.

Matthews is accused of the murder of Ms Wall on July 9 at the hospital, which is run by the 2gether NHS Foundation Trust.

The court heard that as the charge was so serious, the case and any bail application could only be dealt with at the Crown Court.

Emma Davies, representing Matthews, did not make any representations on her client's behalf.

No formal plea was entered and Matthews, who was wearing black t-shirt, was remanded in custody to appear at Gloucester Crown Court before Mr Justice Teare on July 15.

Peter Martin, chairman of the bench, told him: 'Mr Matthews, you have heard what has been said. You are being sent for trial at the Crown Court sitting on July 15.

'You should be there for 9.30am. Do you understand.'Matthews replied: 'Yes.'

Ms Wall, 53, died in hospital shortly after being stabbed in the back at Wotton Lawn Hospital on Wednesday.

The family of the grandmother-of-two,
 from Tuffley, Gloucester, have issued a statement saying: 'We would 
like to thank everyone for their support and such kind words that have 
been said about Sharon.

'She was nothing less than one in a 
million and to say that she will be missed is an understatement.

'We 
would ask for people to respect our privacy and allow us to grieve for 
her at this difficult time.'

Ms Wall lived alone in Tuffley, around three miles from the unit.

One neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: 'I've lived here for 12 years and she was here then.

'She was caring - especially with animals. We both had lurchers and that's how we got talking.

'When mine got run over she came to the vets with me. She took in stray cats too.

The neighbour added: 'I feel sorry for her family going through this.'

Tragedy:
 A 61-year-old man has been charged with murder after Sharon Wall was 
stabbed to death at the Wotton Lawn psychiatric hospital

The 88-bed Wotton Lawn facility, in 
Gloucester, has a low-security unit for male patients who have a history
 of serious mental illness and must be kept in a secure environment.

An
 intensive care unit at the hospital has ten individual en-suite 
bedrooms, to which patients are referred for short periods of time.

Ms Wall would have been responsible for washing, dressing and feeding patients, as well as taking them to the toilet.

Last night the Health Secretary Jeremy
 Hunt said: ‘The events in Gloucestershire are devastating and our 
thoughts are with the family, friends and colleagues of the staff member
 involved.’

A 
Gloucestershire police spokesman were called 
at around 7.30am on July 9 to Wotton Lawn Hospital following reports that a woman had been stabbed.

Emergency: Ms Wall was taken to a the Gloucestershire Royal hospital, but died of her injuries within an hour

Ms Wall was taken to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital but died of her injuries at around 8.30am.

Workers at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital, on the same site as Wotton Lawn, have spoken of their 'shock' at her death.

A former colleague of Ms Wall's, who asked not to be named, added: 'She was truly amazing.'

Tributes have been paid to the NHS worker on social media, as her colleagues and friends tried to come to terms with the tragedy.

Tania Daniels wrote on Facebook: 'I'm in shock. My thoughts are with your family. RIP lovely lady. I'll remember the times you came to my house years ago we had some good laughs and chinwags.'

Michelle Sansom said: 'Such sad news. RIP poor lady, my thoughts and prayers go to your family and friends and all the staff as well.'
