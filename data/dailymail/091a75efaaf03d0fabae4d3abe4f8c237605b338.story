In suede jacket, checked shirt and smart loafers, the grey-haired gentleman walking down the street is a picture of well-to-do respectability.

A few paces ahead, with cropped hair, tattoos and jogging pants, is a young man who looks like life has dealt him a somewhat tougher hand.

But although they appear to come from opposite ends of the social spectrum, this is, in fact, father and son.

The older man is Lord Brabourne, 64, grandson of Earl Mountbatten of Burma, childhood friend of the Prince of Wales and godson of the Duke of Edinburgh.

Family stroll: Lord Barbourne and his son Nicholas walking in London's Kings Road this week

Slightly ahead of him and chatting on a mobile phone, is his son, the Honourable Nicholas Knatchbull, 30 –  also known as  Lord Romsey – who has fought a long battle with crack cocaine and heroin.

Over the years, the distance between them has been much greater than the few paces that separated them in a London street earlier this week.

In the darkest days of Nicholas’s drug addiction, there was talk of his parents disinheriting him.

They were said to be worried about leaving Broadlands, the 5,000-acre ancestral estate and 60-room stately home in Hampshire, in his care and feared he would squander the family’s £100million fortune.

Then two years ago, Lord Brabourne suddenly decided to leave Broadlands, and Penny, his wife of more than 30 years, for a new life in the Bahamas with his mistress.

The romance was complicated and his lover, Jeannie McWeeny, 58, the widow of baronet Sir Nicholas Nuttall, is said to have dumped him at one point. They have since been spotted back in London, where Lord Brabourne has a home in Belgravia.

This week, he spent the afternoon with his son, strolling down the King’s Road and visiting the Peter Jones department store in Sloane Square.

It was, perhaps, a sign of a positive development in Nicholas’s life, which despite its great privilege, has seen him struggle to beat his demons.

Nicholas was educated at Eton, where he helped mentor family friend Prince William, who was in the year below. Then he went on to Edinburgh University but dropped out after just six weeks and  descended into drug addiction.

By 2009, the young heir had sunk so low that fellow junkies caught him on camera smoking crack and heroin, and sold the film to a downmarket newspaper.

An expensive spell in rehab followed.

Shabby though Nicholas appeared on his stroll, with his tattoo collection having grown, and dark bags under his eyes, he actually looked healthier than he has for some time.

He has put on weight and seemed at ease in the company of the man he calls ‘Pops’.

Like his father, Nicholas has a somewhat colourful private life. Eighteen months ago, it was revealed he was engaged to Zeaphena Badley, 29, an unmarried Anglo-Jamaican mother of two brought up on a grim south London council estate. The  state of the romance is unclear at the moment.

Although his mother Lady Brabourne, a long-term confidante and carriage-driving companion of Prince Philip, reportedly disowned Nicholas after he was filmed smoking crack, his father was said to have been heartened by his son finding love.

A friend told the Daily Mail in December 2010 that while Lord Brabourne may not be ‘thrilled that she may well be the next Baroness Brabourne, as long as Nicholas is going in the right direction in can only be viewed as a positive thing’.

And tough as it is to deal with a child’s drug addiction, Lord Brabourne has suffered enough tragedy to be able to keep it all in perspective. In 1979 he lost his grandfather Lord Mountbatten when the IRA bombed his private boat just off Ireland.

His beloved younger brother Nicholas, 14, also died, as well as deckhand Paul Maxwell, 15. His grandmother, Baroness Brabourne, 83, died of her injuries the following day.

When his first son was born, Lord Brabourne named him after the brother he had lost.

But although so much hope was invested in Nicholas, the boy seemed destined for trouble.

More tragedy hit the family when daughter Leonora died of a kidney tumour aged five in 1991. She is buried at Broadlands.

The Brabournes’ other child, Alexandra, 29, a theology graduate and goddaughter of Princess Diana, has reportedly been groomed to take over the family estate when the time comes.

Since Lord Brabourne deserted Broadlands, his estranged wife has taken over the running of the estate and even replaced him as the High Steward of Romsey.

The daughter of a former butcher who founded the Angus Steakhouse restaurant chain, she was plain Penny Eastwood when she married into the family in 1979. 

The first Baron Brabourne was MP Edward Knatchbull, given the hereditary title in 1880.

The family motto is ‘My glory is in the cross’.
