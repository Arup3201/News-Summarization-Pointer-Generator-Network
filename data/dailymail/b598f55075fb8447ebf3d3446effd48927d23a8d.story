A British businessman branded a lying ‘gigolo’ was yesterday jailed for 20 years for the savage murder of his fiancée in a Paris hotel room.

Ian Griffin, 45, remained impassive as a French judge sentenced him for the killing of millionairess Kinga Legg, 36, at the five-star Bristol.

Her body was found in the bath of the couple’s £1,000-a-night room, after Griffin, who claimed it was an accident, fled to England in his Porsche 911.

The couple had been on their way to Monaco where they planned to marry. But Griffin was seeing another girlfriend, Tracy Baker, at the same time.

Miss Baker, 34, who had a child with the businessman after he was controversially released on bail last year and has stood by him, was also in the Paris Assizes when the jury verdict was read out by Judge Didier Safar.

She was overcome with emotion as she saw the frail Griffin, who was on crutches, led to the cells.

A few hours earlier, he had told the court that he wanted to apologise to Miss Legg’s parents for her death – which he claimed he could not remember as he had blacked out.

‘To think I could do that to the girl I love, that’s killing me,’ he said. ‘I have been through every regret, every emotion. I would give my life for her’s tomorrow.’

But prosecutor Philippe Courroye said he did not believe any of Griffin’s versions of events, saying the case was a classic one of ‘violence against women’.

He also dismissed suggestions that Griffin, a confessed love cheat, was a successful businessman, saying he had ‘no official income’ and lived off his girlfriends and wealthy parents.

Pointing to Griffin sitting a few feet away, with his crutches beside him and claiming to be seriously ill, Mr Courroye said: ‘He is trying to fool you. He lies to everyone.

‘Through his lies, he kills for a second time.The intention of homicide is obvious’.

Griffin, originally from Warrington in Cheshire, said he had gone into a ‘black hole’ of memory loss caused by alcohol and anti-depressants. But Mr Courroye said on the final day of his murder trial: ‘There were more than 100 bruises, 17 on the skull, 33 on the chest. They ranged from the face to the feet.

Griffin has been living freely on bail for the past year-and-a-half with Miss Baker, herself an entrepreneur who appeared on the Dragon’s Den TV show this year. Above, the couple outside court before sentencing today 

‘If there were so many injuries, it is because he wanted to kill her. The autopsy revealed the power of the blows. It was a martyred body.’

Griffin has been living freely on bail for the past year-and-a-half with Miss Baker, herself an entrepreneur who appeared on the Dragon’s Den TV show this year.

Both have portrayed Miss Legg, a wealthy Polish businesswoman who was earning more than a quarter of a million pounds year, as a violent alcoholic who regularly attacked Griffin.

Miss Legg ran a successful firm exporting more than 300 million tomatoes a year from Poland to major companies such as McDonald’s, Tesco and Carrefour. Mr Courroye said there was ‘ongoing violence’ between Griffin and Miss Legg. He said Griffin was a ‘kind of gigolo’ who relied on his wealthy parents for money, as well as his girlfriends.

Mr Courroye rubbished claims that Griffin’s memory had ‘disappeared into a black hole’ at the time of Miss Legg’s death.

‘It is impossible to believe this state of amnesia, this savage aggression,’ said Mr Courroye.

Referring to Griffin trying to clean up the crime scene, before booking another two nights in the room, and then escaping, Mr Courroye said: ‘Is Ian Griffin mad? Is he incoherent?

‘Is he panicking? No, he wants to buy time, he wants to put distance between him and the crime scene. This organisation shows coherence to his thoughts.’

Mr Courroye said there was no possibility of Griffin’s heavy drinking being used as an excuse for the murder.

‘Alcohol is not a reason for excluding criminal responsibility,’ he said. ‘On the contrary, in law it is usually an aggravating circumstance.’ The prosecutor called on the jury not to reduce Griffin’s sentence due to his vulnerable image, saying it was all a show.

A tearful Miss Baker was also in court, saying she ‘broke into a million pieces’ when she heard the businessman’s fiancée had been found dead – but her main concern was for him.

She portrayed her love rival as a violent, jealous, depressive who had once tried to stab Griffin with a knife, and punched him in the head while wearing a ring.

After fleeing the scene of the crime in May 2009, Griffin reached Britain and then he went into hiding for five days before being arrested. He was finally extradited to France in 2011.

Then, in a controversial move which infuriated Miss Legg’s family, Griffin was released on bail in March last year, and renewed his relationship with Miss Baker.

Griffin’s parents, Bernard, an architect, and Janet, an interior designer, were in court for the sentencing.
