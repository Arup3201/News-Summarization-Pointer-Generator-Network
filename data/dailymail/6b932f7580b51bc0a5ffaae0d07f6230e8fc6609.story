In her role as a high-powered City lawyer, Miriam Clegg does not often get the chance to play the everyday school mum. 

So it is little wonder she ended up looking surprisingly glamorous on a visit to a primary school yesterday – no doubt to the despair of regular mums everywhere.

The Deputy Prime Minister’s wife lit up the playground as she sashayed into Lairdsland Primary School in Glasgow flicking a perfectly coiffed mane and flashing a bright smile.

And although she was on a day off from her estimated £600,000-a-year job, her lustrous skin and carefully put together designer outfit – complete with chunky gold watch and pearl earrings – showed she wasn’t holding back in the style stakes.

But perhaps the excitement of such an unusual occasion was too much for the mother-of-three.

She was pictured pulling an array of astonishing expressions as she joined in a class promoting healthy eating with the Kirkintilloch school’s pupils and her husband Nick.

Or maybe it was the sheer relief at taking a break from the Lib Dem conference that caused Mrs Clegg to crack up laughing.

The 45-year-old sat among the pupils dishing out the strawberries and melons but became goggle-eyed when a little girl reached over to take some from her plate. 

But then, that lovingly ironed white top wouldn’t have looked quite so crisp and chic if decorated with a splash of strawberry juice.
