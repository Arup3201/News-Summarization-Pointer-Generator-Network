Drunks who abuse staff in A&E departments should be fined £50, health minister Norman Lamb has said

Drunks who abuse staff in A&E departments should be fined £50, health minister Norman Lamb has said.

Those who ‘gratuitously’ consume too much alcohol, especially at the weekends, are putting a ‘huge’ burden on hospitals according to the senior Liberal Democrat.

He wants on-the-spot fines for them, starting with those who are ‘abusive’ to medical staff, and can make A&E feel like a ‘war zone’.

Mr Lamb said: ‘There’s an issue with youngsters drinking too much. It’s having a massive impact on people’s health and the consequences for them further down the line are enormous.

‘The health service is under a lot of pressure and we all have a responsibility to the NHS to make sure it is sustainable and we don’t abuse the fact that it’s a freely available service – a principle I strongly endorse.

‘But it can be like a war zone there late on Friday night. If someone is drunk and abusive they have to feel there are some consequences to that.’

Mr Lamb is putting the policy forward for the Lib Dems’ election manifesto. If his colleagues back it, it could be implemented if the party end up in a second coalition next year.

He suggested a fine of £50 per incident, adding that with the right safeguards he did not believe the measure would lead to a ‘slippery slope’ of charges for other patients seen to have behaved irresponsibly.

NHS staff would have to use the power sparingly – and not fine people who are alcoholics seeking treatment, or people with mental health problems who may appear abusive.

But doctors said the proposal was unworkable, and that many people who turn up at emergency departments drunk are also injured, or have other health conditions. Mr Lamb said: ‘It’s important for a Liberal party to make clear that with freedom comes responsibility.

‘This is not about alcoholics, or people with mental health problems,’ he said. ‘It’s very important that they are referred automatically for the right treatment.

‘Staff would have to exercise discretion, and there would of course be a right of appeal if it was wrongly used in this way.

‘It’s about getting faster referrals for people with alcoholism or mental health problems, while tackling those who gratuitously drink far too much.’

Alcohol-related hospital admissions have risen sharply over the past decade in the UK. There are now one million per year – and alcohol costs the taxpayer £3.5billion every year.

There were nearly 60,000 physical assaults on NHS staff in 2011/12.

Gordon Miles, chief executive of the College of Emergency Medicine said: ‘It would be very tricky, and I haven’t seen a proposal that would be workable. What if someone is injured as well as being inebriated?

‘For example they had a couple of glasses of wine, fell and really hurt themselves? The priority is treating them.

‘It’s all very well saying these people are a huge burden on hospitals which they are, and A&E staff do face challenging situations. But there are many other ways we need to tackle alcohol abuse before it gets  to hospital.

‘It’s also very difficult to isolate who would be liable, as people with depression or mental health problems can drink to alleviate the symptoms. And practically, would you have to take the money first, from a drunk person, or take a credit card? Or if it’s a case of collecting it afterwards, then for £50, the effort needed to chase it up might become uneconomic.’

Charges for A&E apply elsewhere. In Ireland, patients must pay 100 euros (£80) if they do not have a referral  letter from a GP, with limited exemptions.

Northern Ireland’s health minister Edwin Poots has also backed charging drink and drug abusers at A&E.
