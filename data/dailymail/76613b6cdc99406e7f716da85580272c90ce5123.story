Some breakfast cereals contain as much sugar as seven and a half chocolate fingers per portion, campaigners warned last night.

They said such high levels fuel childhood obesity and show the Government is not keeping the industry in check.

Experts claim many manufacturers are ignoring advice to cut sugar, which has been dubbed the new tobacco over fears that it could become as big a national health problem as cigarettes.

Sweets for breakfast? Kellogg's Frosties and Crunchy Nut each contain about nine teaspoons of sugar per 100g - making them each about one-third pure sugar. Experts warn sugar poses a national health problem

Some products actually contain far more sugar than they did three years ago, according to research by the campaign group Action On Sugar. It found 14 out of 50 cereals were at least a third sugar – 33.3g per 100g, or eight teaspoons in each serving.

Action On Sugar nutritionist Kawther Hashem said: ‘You wouldn’t give your child chocolate biscuits for breakfast, yet certain manufacturers are effectively doing that for us.’

The worst offender was Aldi’s Harvest Morn Choco Rice at 39g per 100g, which was up by 18 per cent since a survey by the consumer group Which? in 2012.

Morrisons Honey & Nut Corn Flakes and Sainsbury’s Honey Nut Corn Flakes came in at 36.3g per 100g – up by 8 per cent compared with three years ago, although this is disputed. The amount in Kellogg’s Frosties was 37g per 100g and that for its Crunchy Nut was 25g per 100g, neither of which has changed.

Graham MacGregor, chairman of Action On Sugar and professor of cardiovascular medicine at Queen Mary University of London, said: ‘Children quickly become used to high-sugar cereals and find healthier ones less palatable, which has long-term implications on their health. Too much sugar leads to weight gain, raising the risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and some cancers.’

He said the food industry had lobbied the Government to water down a voluntary scheme called the Responsibility Deal designed to make products less unhealthy, adding: ’One of the greatest failures in tackling obesity is the Government’s appeasement of the food industry.

‘The Responsibility Deal, which allows the food industry to regulate themselves – likened to Dracula being put in control of the blood bank – has failed. It’s time for it to be scrapped.’

Kellogg’s said the sugar in its cereals was to a tiny proportion of daily consumption. 

Sainsbury’s said it had not increased the sugar in Honey Nut Corn Flakes, but had recalculated, which had led to a higher figure.

Morrisons said its Honey & Nut Corn Flakes had not changed and could not explain the increase. From next month it will have 8 per cent less sugar. 

Aldi also said it would reduce the sugar content of its cereals.
