Ian Poulter was nicknamed ‘The Postman’ by his Europe team-mates at the 2010 Ryder Cup at Celtic Manor. The singles were about to begin when he made a vow: ‘I will deliver my point.’

He duly did. Europe won. Poulter delivered three points from four matches then and four from five at Valhalla two years earlier. He always delivers.

His first-ever Ryder Cup point, at Oakland Hills in 2004, technically won the trophy that year. His four points from four matches during the Miracle in Medinah two years ago were more momentous still.

So to arrive here at Gleneagles, out of form and down on inspiration, in Paul McGinley’s team only as a captain’s pick and not a certain starter, has brought a new pressure on the 38-year-old. And he looked under every ounce of it on Friday as he and rookie Stephen Gallacher were drubbed 5&4 by the Texan rookies Jordan Speith and Patrick Reed in the morning fourballs.

But yesterday, at 12.29pm, Poulter took a parcel of magic and dropped it on this biggest of stages.

The USA fourball pair of Rickie Fowler and Jimmy Walker were one up on Poulter and his partner Rory McIlroy. Fowler had hit a peach of an approach to the 15th to guarantee himself a birdie and a likely two-hole lead in the match with three holes to play.

Poulter’s first shot had hit the rough and his second sat 50 yards from the pin, next to a bunker. He addressed the ball, glanced up, took a short backswing and chipped. The ball carried, and bounced ... and dropped.

The sound that came from Poulter’s mouth was something between ‘YES!’ and ‘ARRRGHH’, only longer, much longer. He didn’t so much pump both fists as his entire upper body, more than once, in a visceral release.

The crowd responded, tumultuously, and then, most importantly of all, Poulter carried the momentum, sank a brilliant putt at the next to level the match and contributed significantly as he and McIlroy held on for a half.

‘There was a lot of emotion, it’s been waiting to come out,’ Poulter said. ‘It took way too long for it to do so but it was nice to be able to do it in that fashion.

‘Obviously I haven’t played my best golf [here]. You just have to get something going. You have to stay positive. You have to keep telling yourself that good stuff’s coming. I’ve got a big heart and I love this Ryder Cup.’

It was put to Poulter that he had been playing ‘like a drain’ up until that point. He took the observation on the chin, although he rightly pointed out he made two early birdies yesterday before ‘I kind of fell asleep in the middle [of the match]. Then it was nice to get the juices flowing. Not much has gone in the hole yet so far this week.’

He then pointed out he has featured just twice here, something that might have been construed as mild displeasure. Not so, it appears. He said it was more important for him to contribute to the score ‘from a team perspective’.

On the issue of being omitted yesterday afternoon just as he had hit form, he added: ‘Yeah, but there’s also lots of other guys that want to play. Only eight can get out on the golf course, we have 12 great players. There are no egos in this team, you have to respect the captain’s decision.’

He had already made light of his nickname and the inevitability it would be mentioned. ‘Funny things happen, don’t they?’ he said. He joked that perhaps his moniker should now change to ‘Late Delivery’ or ‘Second Class Post’.

Poulter was then asked whether he would be making any vow to his captain, Paul McGinley, about delivery a point in the singles. ‘I’m not telling you,’ he smiled.

His team-mate Henrik Stenson interjected at that stage to add: ‘That means he can guarantee a half. Or better.’

By close of play, Poulter will certainly have finished his round.

All eyes are on Poulter as he hits a chip - he will be hoping to deliver again for Europe on Sunday
