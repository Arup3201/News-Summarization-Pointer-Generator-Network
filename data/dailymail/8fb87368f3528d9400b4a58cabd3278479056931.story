A deadly avalanche and heavy snowfall in Afghanistan has now killed more than 230 people, officials said today. 

The death toll is expected to rise as desperate rescue crews to try to gain access to rural villages buried under deep snow drifts.

Isolated villages in the north-east of the war-torn country have been cut off for days because of the extreme weather conditions.

Mohammad Aslam Syas, deputy chief of the Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority, said 186 people have been confirmed dead alone in the hard-hit Panjshir Province, 60 miles northeast of Kabul. 

Speaking on television, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said that he would postpone a trip to neighboring Iran to remain behind and try to help with the recovery.

In an emotional address, he said: 'I can't leave my countrymen and my home alone right now'.

Afghanistan has suffered through some three decades of war since the Soviet invasion in 1979. 

But natural disasters such as landslides, floods and avalanches have also taken a heavy toll on a country with little infrastructure or development outside of its major cities.  

Among recent major natural disasters in Afghanistan was a massive landslide in May that killed hundreds. 

Some estimates suggest that 2,700 people died, although there has never been a definitive count. Another landslide in 2012 killed 71 people.
