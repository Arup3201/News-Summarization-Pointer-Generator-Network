Aaron Whiteside steps back in time whenever he goes through his front door - because his house is decorated just like a typical English home of the 1930s.  

Ever since he grew up listening to pre-War music, the 31-year-old has been obsessed with the era, and has now spent £10,000 renovating his house in a classic style.  

Among the home's antique features are rare wallpaper which spent decades buried underground, original art deco fireplaces and an electric cooker which was among the first ever made.

'I've been interested in the 1930s since I was really young - about five years old,' said Mr Whiteside, who runs his own glazing company.  

'I used to be told stories about the 1930s and we used to listen to the music, so I think that's what's inspired my interest.'  

He bought his home on a suburban street in Blackpool for £80,000 seven years ago, after it had stood empty for nearly a decade.  

The enthusiast has worked tirelessly to transform the house - installing German wallpaper which was buried in a time capsule in the 1930s, and cost Mr Whiteside £100 a roll.  

Unprepossessing: The three-bedroom home is outwardly indistinguishable from neighbouring houses

Old-fashioned:  The kitchen of the house looks like a real relic, without most modern conveniences

Back in time: The front room of the home, which cost Mr Whiteside £80,000 when he bought it seven years ago

He also bought up an early electric heater and three fireplaces - one bought for £400, the other two simply salvaged from a skip.  

The home is heated in a traditional way too, as instead of central heating it relies on four coal fires.  

Mr Whitehouse said: 'There's things like wall masts, art deco pictures, radiograms, those are things I've been collecting since I was a child, I've travelled all over the country for things I've wanted.  

'I've tried to make sure all the items in the house are originals, rather than being replicas. I even heat my water from the coal fire - which works out much cheaper than the modern way of heating water.  

Cheery: Mr Whiteside has thrown himself into the 1930s lifestyle, with a particularly sparse vintage bathroom

Eccentric: Mr Whiteside's friends are keen to visit his home and find more vintage collector's items for him

'Some things have been really expensive, like the wallpaper I got on eBay. I rely on sites like eBay quite a lot, second-hand shops, and my friends all know about it so they recommend things they've seen.  

'One of my favourite items are my two suites - the first I bought from eBay, it's by Wilton carpet makers and has the original receipt for when it was bought. It cost £51 and when I got it, it came with a letter from the original owner's son.  

'The letter says that average worker would have earned £6 per week back then so this would have been a really expensive piece of furniture back in the day. The other suite dates from 1928 and still has the original material.  

Pricey: The wallpaper was salvaged from a 1930s German time capsule and cost £100 for each roll

Classic sounds: A wooden radio provides the soundtrack to Mr Whiteside's lifestyle

Pottery: More of the unusual decorative objects Mr Whiteside has managed to unearth 

Memories: The 31-year-old was inspired by hearing music and stories from the pre-War era

'But my pride of joy is a HMV state of the art gramophone from 1937. It came from an old house down south where bits and pieces were being sold off, and a friend of a friend told me about it.  

'People are really interested in the house - my friends always ask if they can take pictures, they think it's really different.'  

Mr Whiteside now plans to paint the front of his house and re-plant the garden, in order to complete his vision of the perfect vintage home.
