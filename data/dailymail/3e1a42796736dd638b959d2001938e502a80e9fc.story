A widow who had just buried her husband after he was killed in a car crash came home to find her house had been burglarized, authorities revealed.

Anne Crowley returned home from the cemetery with her grieving children on Wednesday to find that their home in Delano, Minnesota had been targeted by thieves. 

Mrs Crowley's husband Steven, 50, died 
in a head-on collision on April 11. Mr Crowley, who worked in the investment industry, leaves his wife Anne and three 
children – Elizabeth, Mark and William. 

Steven Crowley (pictured third left with his wife and three children) died in a car crash on April 11. His wife returned from his funeral on Wednesday to find that their home has been burgled

Mr Crowley's funeral took place at 11.30am at St Peter’s Catholic Church in Delano.

Investigators believe that the callous thieves targeted the home, which is also the location of the family horse breeding and training business, some time between 10.30am and 2.30pm.

Sheriff’s Lt. Greg
 Findley told MailOnline today: 'It's terrible. There's a small 
segment of society that preys on people in this type of situation.'

As yet no suspects had been arrested and Lt Findley declined to say what had been stolen from the home.

A possible suspect vehicle was described as an older Suburban-style truck, charcoal grey in color.

Anyone with information is asked to contact the Wright County Sheriff's Office at 763 682-1162.
