Shares of Facebook Inc jumped nearly 13 per cent on Wednesday, as investors breathed a sigh of relief that expiring trading restrictions on a huge block of shares failed to trigger an immediate wave of insider selling.

'While the lockup is expiring, there is nothing requiring anybody to sell,' said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York.

He added: 'Given the low price, these long-term holders are deciding to hold the stock, and that is lifting it here as the fear of the expiration subsides.'

Signs of life: Facebook shares climbed nearly 13
per cent even after the largest block of shares held by company 
insiders were eligible for sale

Roughly 800 million Facebook shares were eligible for sale on Wednesday after restrictions on insider selling were lifted on the biggest block since Facebook's May initial public offering.

The lockup expiration greatly expands the 921-million-share 'float' available for trading on the market until now.

'We've seen this before with other lockups. People sell them leading up to the lockup period expiring, and then they have a bit of a relief rally,' said Ryan Jacob, chief executive of the Jacob Funds, which does not own Facebook shares.

In August, shares of the online reviews website Yelp Inc surged by more than 20 per cent on the day that insider trading restrictions expired.

That stock's rally was boosted as short-sellers scrambled to cover their positions when the expected flood of selling failed to materialize, say analysts.

Facebook shares finished on Wednesday's regular trading session up 12.6 per cent at $22.36 on the Nasdaq, with trading volume for the stock more than four times the average during the past 50 days.

The world's No. 1 online social network became the only U.S. company to debut with a market value of more than $100 billion.

But its value has dropped nearly 50 per cent since the IPO on concerns about money-making prospects over the long term.

Insider trading lockup provisions 
started to expire in August, and the rolling expirations have added to 
the pressure on the stock.

Restrictions on insider selling have expired in waves. A limitation on more than 200 million shares expired on Oct. 29.

COST OF SHORTINGPivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser said he did not expect Facebook insiders to sell all of their shares as the lockups expired.

'I would expect heavy volumes over the next few weeks, but not undigestible volumes,' said Wieser.

By his estimate, roughly 486 million of the nearly 800 million newly freed Facebook shares will be sold.

There is some evidence that the heavy interest in 'shorting' the stock was dissipating, given the poor performance since it first sold shares in May.

Strategy: Mobile revenue has been a concern since before Facebook's IPO - as more and more people are accessing the site on wireless phones and tablets

Investors who believe a stock will fall can bet against it by shorting the stock, that is, borrowing it and selling it in the hopes it will decline.

According to Markit's Data Explorers, about 28 per cent of the shares available for short-selling were being borrowed for that purpose, down from a high of more than 80 per cent in early August.

Similarly, SunGard's Astec Analytics, which also tracks interest in shorting, noted that the cost of borrowing Facebook shares is down more than 50 per cent since the beginning of the month.

'Everything would seem to indicate the market is losing its appetite to short Facebook,' wrote Karl Loomes, market analyst at Astec.

The cost of shorting Facebook has declined to 0.18 per cent on an annualized basis, Astec said on Wednesday.

By contrast, shortly after the IPO, the cost to short the stock ranged from 40 to 50 per cent annually.'It's become somewhat of a controversial stock - it always adds fuel to the fire if you have a sizable short position,' said Stephen Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Morgan in San Francisco.

'But the unlock is not new news. It doesn't mean everyone is going to sell and it doesn't mean every order is going to come in today.'

Several members of Facebook's senior management have sold millions of dollars' worth of shares in recent weeks through pre-arranged stock trading plans as lockup restrictions expired.

Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg has sold roughly 530,000 shares this month, netting just over $11 million, though she still owns roughly 20 million vested shares in Facebook.

In August, Facebook board member Peter Thiel sold roughly $400million worth of Facebook stock, the majority of his stake, when an earlier phase of lockup restrictions expired.

Facebook's 28-year-old chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has pledged not to sell any shares before September 2013.

Facebook had a notorious initial public offering in May at $38, mired by technical glitches, and it's been under pressure since because of doubts about its ability to grow revenue at a fast clip.

The shares saw their biggest one-day gain on October 24, the day after the company reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter results and detailed for the first time how much money it made from mobile ads.

But shares had declined since then.

Mobile revenue has been a concern since before Facebook's IPO since more and more people are accessing the site on wireless phones and tablets.
