Dozens of celebrities today pressed David Cameron to legalise drugs. 

They included longstanding campaigners for drug law liberalisation including comedian Russell Brand, rock star Sting, and tycoon Sir Richard Branson.

Others among 90 people who signed a letter to Downing Street included left-wing barrister Michael Mansfield QC and author and former heroin addict Will Self, who was once accused of taking drugs on board former Prime Minister John Major’s election bus.

The letter, organised by the Release drug charity, said that more than 1.5 million people have been subject to ‘unnecessary criminalisation’ for drug possession in Britain over the last 15 years. 

It said that evidence from Australia, the Czech Republic and Portugal shows health problems are dramatically reduced when drug users are not arrested and prosecuted but given advice and medical help.

The letter, which was also backed by the Prison Governors Association and the National Black Police Association, was planned to coincide with drug legalisation protests in London and other capital cities.

Nick Glynn, of the National Black Police Association, said: ‘It is time for a mature, informed, objective debate around the UK’s drugs laws.

‘Enforcement of the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act has created many unintended, negative consequences and new approaches must be considered, including those which have been successful in other countries. Strategies that avoid criminalising people and focus instead on health and education seem to me to offer a positive way forward.’

The letter also asked for a commitment from Mr Cameron to push for an international review on drug laws through the United Nations.

Niamh Eastwood of Release said: ‘In 2002, when the Prime Minister was a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee, he supported the recommendation that the UN consider alternatives to the status quo. We are asking him to stand by that commitment and recognise the damage that has been done, both nationally and internationally, by repressive drug policies.’

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg wants 'rigorously monitored' cannabis legalisation

Kathy Gyngell, from the Centre for Policy Studies think tank, said cannabis is harmful, particularly for teenagers and leads to psychosis

The celebrities have some high-level political support. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg recently put his name to a call for ‘rigorously monitored’ cannabis legalisation.

The demand for legalisation met a dusty reaction from Downing Street and fierce condemnation from opponents of drug law liberalisation. 

A No. 10 spokesman said: ‘We have no intention of decriminalising drugs. With usage at the lowest levels since records began and more people than ever before now more likely to free themselves from dependency through treatment, we are confident this approach is the right one.’

Kathy Gyngell, a research fellow of the right-leaning Centre for Policy Studies think tank, said: ‘Cannabis is harmful. It is particularly harmful for teenagers. It leads to psychosis in large numbers of cases. Other illegal drugs are also harmful. 

‘Drug laws are successful. They have ensured that fewer than six per cent of the population use illegal drugs. Cannabis use has dropped by a third since the 1990s, and cocaine use has levelled off. In Portugal, held up as an example by legalisers, drug use by children has doubled since the laws were liberalised.

‘I believe many of the people who have signed this letter have done so for selfish reasons, because they use drugs themselves.’

Sting gave an interview to the Mail on Sunday’s Event magazine at the weekend in which he said: ‘If I’m feeling stuck on a lyric or an idea isn’t quite gelling, sometimes a puff of weed will free it up. I rarely smoke it socially. It’s just a tool, just as a pen is.’

He added: ‘The drug laws aren’t helping. We need a really honest debate in society. People will tend to want to make life richer. Life seems flat a lot of the time. Chemicals, alcohol, marijuana can help.’
