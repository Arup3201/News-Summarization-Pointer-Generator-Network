Aaron Ramsey scored a stunning brace against Galatasaray as Arsenal ran out comfortable winners in Istanbul. 

Lukas Podolski also scored two as the Gunners won away from home in their final Champions League group game for the first time since 1999. 

Here, Sportsmail gives their player ratings. 

ARSENAL 

Wojciech Szczesny 6

The goalkeeper didn't have too much to do but came out for a cross which he missed, showing there was a little bit of rust present. Relatively composed on his return though.

Mathieu Debuchy 8 (Stefan O'Connor 77mins)

Played excellently on his return to the starting line-up after three months out. Loves going forward but was tested a little defensively in the second half and made sure to help out the youngsters who came off the bench.

Per Mertesacker 7.5

Put the weekend's horror show at the Britannia Stadium behind him. Composed in possession and won a few nice balls in the air so Arsenal could build from the back. Also made a crucial last-ditch block midway through the second half to keep Galatasaray out.

Calum Chambers 7

There will be far harder tests to come for Chambers if he is to play centre back regularly because he was barely tested by Yilmaz or Bulut until the 55th minute.

Hector Bellerin 7

Assured on the ball and calm for someone with so little first-team experience. You can see from his ability to fly forward why Arsene Wenger rates him so highly. 

Aaron Ramsey 9 (Maitland-Niles 46)

Back to his best before being subbed to protect him at half-time. His first goal was a lovely placed finish across the keeper but his second was out of this world. Surely the best strike in the Champions League this season. Honestly, you must see this goal - Ramsey barely swings his left foot at it but he arrows a volley straight into the top left-hand corner. Magic. 

Mathieu Flamini 6 (Zelalem 45)

Sometimes struggled to contain the industrious Wesley Sneijder but overall shielded his back four well. Will want a few more games as easy as this. Made way at half-time after getting booked.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain 9 

If Ramsey hadn't scored twice, Oxlade-Chamberlain would undoubtedly be man of the match. Everything he did was positive, particularly in the first half, and he drove Arsenal forward. Need to see more performances like the first 45 minutes though.

Joel Campbell 7

Will be a bit frustrated he didn't mark his starting appearance with a goal and looked a bit rusty. Caused a lot of problems down the right though. 

Lukas Podolski 8

When he starts he tends to score. The German has a thunderbolt of a right foot and he used it to set the Gunners on their way after only three minutes and added another late on. Frustrates at times, but his finishing ability is without question.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain had a good game and kept up his record of playing in every match this seasson

Yaya Sanogo 6

Did not take his opportunity on this occasion. Caused a few problems but was the poorest of Arsenal's attacking trio. Still extremely raw and does not always hold the ball up well enough. 

SUBSTITUTES 

Ainsley Maitland-Niles (replaced Ramsey 46) 6 - Unfortunately for Maitland-Niles Arsenal's fluidity and intensity slacked off in the second half. He still looked extremely confident for one so young though, and gave a couple of really nice through balls. Made one very important clearance too.

Gedion Zelalem (replaced Flamini 45) 7 - Looks composed on the ball and can slot into the team nicely. Will not have been introduced into a game where there was so little to do before, mind.

Young full back Hector Bellerin showed plenty of promise in the Champions League clash

Stefan O'Connor (replaced Debuchy 77) 6 - Very little time to make much of an impact but looked composed for the small period he was on the field.

Subs not used: Damian Martinez, Chuba Akpom, Alex Iwobi, Glen Kamara.

GALATASARAY 

Bolat 5, Camdal 3 (Altintop 45, 6), Kaya 3, Balta 4, Telles 5, Na Bangna 6 (Adin 77, 6), Melo 4, Colak 5, Sneijder 7.5, Yilmaz 4 (Oztekin 45, 5), Bulut 5
