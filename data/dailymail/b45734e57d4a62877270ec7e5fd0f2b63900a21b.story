Residents of a small Florida town say they're shocked and disgusted by the recent disclosure that two members of its police force are accused of being members of the Ku Klux Klan.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement this week released a report saying Fruitland Park Deputy Chief David Borst and Officer George Hunnewell were Klan members. Borst denies being a member.

Borst resigned and Hunnewell was fired last week. A third Fruitland Park officer resigned in 2010 after his Klan ties became public.

A researcher with the Southern Poverty Law Center says it's extremely rare nowadays to find police officers who are Klan members.

Cases the officers worked on also are under scrutiny. On Friday, prosecutors dismissed three cases - two traffic offenses and a misdemeanor battery.

Local residents in town of less than 5,000 residents, reacted with disgust to the news.

Chery Mion told The Miami Herald: 'I'm shocked, very shocked. I didn't think that organization was still around. Yes, in the 1950s. 
But this 2014, and it's rather disconcerting to know.'

Borst, a veteran officer with more than 20 years of law enforcement service, resigned and Hunnewell was fired last week. A phone number listed for Borst was disconnected. Hunnewell's number was not listed.

Ann Hunnewell claimed she and her ex-husband, George Hunnewell, joined the KKK in 2008 at the request of then-Police Chief Mark Isom, it was revealed last week.

She said they were trying to find out if another officer was a KKK member. After investigating, she and her ex-husband later left the group.

Ann Hunnewell was a secretary for the police department before leaving in 2010. Her statements were contained in the report tying Hunnewell and Borst to the KKK.

The information about the former officers was given to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement by the FBI. Parts of the Florida report were redacted and it's not clear what the FBI was investigating when it discovered the officers link to the KKK.

Ann Hunnewell told investigators that she and her former husband never paid dues, attended meetings or witnessed any criminal activity.

She also said there was no documentation of their undercover operation.

Fruitland Park has 13 full-time and five part-time cops, and many were trained by Borst.

In 2009, Fruitland Park Police Officer James Elkins resigned after pictures surfaced of him in uniform with a pointy Klan hood and robe.

The police department has 13 officers for the city has about 5,000 residents. It is located about 40 miles north-west of Orlando.

Fruitland Park was once known for its citrus groves and is in Lake County, where KKK violence in the 1940s and 1950s was rampant.
