Modern women are increasingly opting for time-saving products to fit their beauty regime around their busy schedules

Gone are the days when women spent hours preening themselves with lotions, potions and beauty treatments.

As the recession bites and working hours rise, women's beauty regimes are taking a back seat. More of us than ever are turning to quick fix beauty treatments and products rather than spending hours in front of the mirror.

In the past year alone Superdrug has seen huge demand for beauty products that save time - with dry shampoo topping the list.

The retailer sells fifteen masks 
every minute and has seen a 35 per cent rise in sales of the mask as 
well as an eight per cent rise in sales of Superdrug’s own label face 
wipes.

Another favourite 
has been dry shampoo which sees over 17,000 bottles sold every week as 
time-strapped Brits look for quick and easy ways to freshen up their 
locks.

The quick hair fix takes less than 
fifteen seconds to work its magic compared to the average twenty minutes
time of washing and drying hair.

Despite
the masses of expensive and high-tech products on offer, the poll by 
Superdrug found that twelve per cent of people claimed to spend just two
minutes or less looking after their skin every day.

Following the demand for speedy 
beauty tricks, Superdrug is introducing a range of time-saving products 
including giant hair doughnuts, lip stains and eyeliner appliques which 
glue on.

Sara Wolverson,
beauty director of Superdrug said: 'For people that lead a busy 
schedule these quick fixes are the perfect opportunity to give yourself a
quick pick me up without having to spent lots of time .

'We’ve
seen a massive demand for products that take no time at all. Whether 
it’s down to people working longer hours or people generally just 
spending less time on pampering themselves there is a definite trend in 
product that take less than ten minutes to apply.'

Time-strapped Brits no longer have time to wash their hair as much and sales of dry shampoo have rocketed

 

Lip stains that last 24 hours are replacing lipsticks as a form of semi-permanent make-up

Hair doughnuts are a quick and easy way to style your locks without endless backcombing

Adhesive eyeliner is fast becoming a hot new trend for time-poor Brits

Sleep-in rollers are the perfect way to get bouncy hair without sacrificing beauty sleep
