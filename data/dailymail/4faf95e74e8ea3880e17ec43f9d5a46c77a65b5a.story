Stoke captain Ryan Shawcross is adamant he will not let constantly being snubbed by England get him down or change his mind about the prospect of playing for Wales instead.

Shawcross, who won his solitary senior Three Lions cap as a substitute in a friendly in 2012, once again missed out on selection for the current round of internationals.

The 27-year-old centre-back did not get a look-in this time even after John Stones had to be withdrawn due to injury, with Calum Chambers the man called up as a replacement.

The Stoke defender says he is pleased with his start to the season in club football and will keep working hard

Shawcross remains eligible to play for Wales, but has insisted for some time that he is not considering that as an option.

Regarding his ongoing battle to get back into the England team, he told The Sentinel: 'It's up to the manager to pick me and if he doesn't I've just got to carry on playing well for Stoke.

'I made a decision a couple of years ago to play for England. I've got one cap and I want more. If it happens, it happens.

Shawcross says he won't be frustrated if he is never picked for England again but won't switch allegiances

'It doesn't bother me if I don't get picked. If I get picked, brilliant; if I don't, it doesn't really bother me.

'My form over last season and the start of this season, I'm pleased with it. All I can do is keep clean sheets and win games for Stoke.'

On Arsenal defender Chambers, Shawcross added: 'He's a brilliant player who's got a bright future.

Shawcross says he has no complaints over Roy Hodgson's selection of Chambers ahead of him

'The England manager decided he wanted him in his squad and I've got no complaints.

'If I don't get into the England squad until I retire, I will have no frustration. I'm just happy to be playing.'
