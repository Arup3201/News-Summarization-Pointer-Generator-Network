With Christmas over and the New Year upon us, many of us are feeling the effects of overindulgence and turning our minds to that age-old New Year’s resolution - weight loss.

But is there anything that can help shift that festive flab along with - or instead of - diet and exercise?

Slimming products such as pills and food supplements can be effective if combined with a balanced, healthy, low calorie diet, says Omar El-Gohary, Superintendent Pharmacist for ChemistDirect.

Omar El-Gohary, from ChemistDirect, says slimming products can be effective but that they only work when combined with a balanced, healthy, low calorie diet

He told MailOnline: ‘But there is no magic weight loss quick fix - all treatments require
 the will-power to maintain a balanced, healthy, low calorie diet.

'Any weight lost can come back if you don't stick to a
 healthy diet and eat in moderation.’

Here, Mr El-Gohary gives his guide to slimming products:

Slim Fast - from £1.27 per item

Slim Fast offers a range of bars, shakes and snacks which can be consumed in place of meals to reduce calorie intake

Slim Fast offers a range of meal replacement bars, shakes and snacks which can be used in conjunction with a balanced meal to offer a reduced calorie diet. 

The Slim Fast products are low in calories but are nutrient rich ensuring you don't miss out on important vitamins and minerals. 

The meals contain at least 25 per cent of energy from protein and 30 per cent of a dieting person's RDA of 23 vitamins and minerals. They also contain essential fatty acids. 

Protein is an important component in weight loss diets helping to fill you up faster, increase muscle mass (with the right exercise) increasing your resting metabolic rate and replacing excessive carbs and fats in your diet.

By following the recommended plan which includes one balanced meal in the evening along with two Slim Fasts in the day, this adds up to 1,200 calories a day which is suitable for weight loss in the overweight and moderately active. 

Anyone more active may need to supplement this diet with additional low-fat snacks. 

While the Slim Fast products may not be to everyone's taste, they are a convenient and effective weight loss option. 

The available evidence shows that this kind of meal replacement diet is more effective than traditional diets in assisting weight loss, and keeping the weight off afterwards.

Alli - £29.95

Alli is the only pharmacy-only medicine in this list and consequently it is the best researched product here. 

Orlistat,
 the active ingredient in Alli, works by blocking some of the natural 
enzyme which breaks down the fat you eat, preventing it from being 
absorbed. 

It should 
only be taken as part of a balanced reduced calorie diet with no more 
than 30 per cent of your calories coming from fats.

Alli works by blocking the enzymes which break down fat - this prevents fat from being absorbed by the body

Because
 undigested fats are passed in stools, if you eat more than the 
recommended amount of fat you are more likely to experience side 
effects.

These include wind, sudden bowel movements and fatty or oily stools.

There
 is evidence available to demonstrate Alli is effective in weight loss, 
and because this is a licensed medicine, its quality, effectiveness and 
safety will have been assessed as part of the licensing procedure. 

Alli
 is best suited for those who have a BMI over 28, can adhere strictly to
 the recommended diet and who experience minimal side effects when 
taking Alli. 

Because Alli contains gelatine it is not suitable for vegetarians.

XLS Fat Binder - £49.99

The key ingredient in XLS Fat Binder is Litramine, a natural fibre derived from an organic plant source. 

The manufacturers claim this can bind to fat, preventing absorption and causing it to be excreted from the body.

XLS Fat Binder is suitable for vegetarians and causes few side effects but its effectiveness as not been proved in an independent study - the manufacturer says it can help people lose three times as much weight

They say it can help you lose three times as much fat as you would have done with a reduced calorie diet. 

There is some evidence to show that Litramine binds to fat and can assist in weight loss as part of a daily diet plan, however, this work was sponsored by the manufacturer of XLS and has yet to be verified by independent researchers. 

BIObind causes no known side effects but it is not suitable for vegetarians or for people who are allergic to shellfish

XLS Fat Binder is generally well tolerated with only mild side effects reported such as occasional loose stools and constipation. 

BIObind - £9.99

BIObind consists of three key ingredients - chitosan, nopal cactus and pysyllium husk. 

Chitosan is a naturally occurring fibre sourced from the shells of shellfish. 

There is some evidence that chitosan is an effective fat binder, reducing the absorption of fats in your diet.  

Nopal cactus contains soluble and insoluble dietary fibres which absorb both water and toxins, which the manufacturer claims can contribute to regular bowel movements.

The manufacturer also claims that copal helps prevent the absorption of simple carbohydrates.

However, there are currently no studies to support this. 

Psyllium husk is extracted from plantain seed and the manufacturer claims that this can improve digestion and cleanse the system and can promote a feeling of fullness by drawing in water to the digestive tract. 

There are no reported side effects with this product. However, as the chitosan is extracted from shellfish, it is not suitable for vegetarians or those with a seafood allergy.

XLS Carb Blocker - £21.99

Made by the same manufacture XLS Fat Binder, XLS Carb Blocker contains a patented ingredient called Phaselight which consists of a standardised complex of glycoproteins from a GM free vegetable source. 

XLS Carb Blocker is said to bind to carbohydrates and reduce their absorption in the body

The manufacturers claim that this product binds to carbohydrates and reduces their absorption.

There is no independent research to verify the claims made by the manufacturer, however on the plus side this product is vegetarian friendly and no side effects have been reported.

Adios Max Herbal Slimming Tablets - £9.60

Adios Max is a herbal medicine traditionally used for weight loss. 

Its main ingredient is Fucus, a seaweed extract. 

Adios Max contains fucus which is traditionally used in herbal medicine to aid weight loss. However, there is no clinical evidence to suggest it is effective

Fucus is a source of iodine, a key component in thyroid function, which the manufacturer claims can speed up your metabolism, burning calories and causing weight loss – although this is unlikely to be an effective mechanism in weight loss unless you have a thyroid problem resulting from iodine deficiency. 

Reported side effects are rare and include some cases of diarrhoea. 

This product is not suitable for anyone with a thyroid problem or anyone on anticoagulant treatments.  It is suitable for vegetarians.  

One study showed Forza Green Coffee 2:2:1 can help people lose more than 10 per cent of their body weight but the research was funded by the manufacturer

Although there is no clinical evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of Fucus in weight loss, it has been used as a traditional herbal medicine for many years as an aid to slimming as part of a calorie controlled diet.

Forza Green Coffee 2:2:1 - £18.40

Forza contains of a high dose of green coffee and is marketed as a fat burner and a pre-workout energy supplement. 

In one study participants lost an average of 10.5 per cent of their overall bodyweight taking this product.

But it should be noted this study was funded by a manufacturer of Green Coffee. 

It is believed that a component of green coffee called chlorogenic acid may be the reason for the weight loss, however, scientists are still not sure how exactly this works. 

Chlorogenic acid doesn’t survive the roasting process so unfortunately you won’t receive this benefit by drinking green coffee.

T5 Super Green Coffee also contains caffeine which is known to increase resting metabolism, niacin, iron, and chromium. 

Niacin is a B vitamin that contributes to energy metabolism and is able to reduce tiredness and fatigue, iron is a chemical element that contributes to healthy oxygen delivery within the body, and chromium is an essential mineral that has been shown to regulate blood sugar levels.

Side effects of this product are rare but may include rapid heart rate and elevated blood pressure.

Celevac - £4.89

The main ingredient in Celevac is methylcellulose, which is what is known as a bulking agent. 

The manufacturer states if taken half an hour before a meal, Celevac can be used to reduce appetite in obese people who are trying to lose weight.

Side effects of Celevac include flatulence and bloating

When Celevac tablets come into contact with water they swell in the gut and send messages to the brain giving a feeling of fullness that helps reduce appetite.

Currently there isn’t enough evidence to back up the manufacturers claims that this is an effective appetite suppressant.

Other side effects include flatulence and abdominal distension.
