Chyna Young was three months pregnant when she was shot four times by her ex-boyfriend Patrick Guillory as he chased her through a street after breaking into her mother's home.

The 18-year-old was hit in the arm, twice in the back and in the neck on the near fatal night last June - the last shot left her paralysed from the neck down.

Despite her devastating injuries, Chyna's bravery and determination saw her give birth to a premature, yet healthy, baby girl in October.

Motherly love: Chyna Young, 18, wanted nothing more than to raise her baby daughter, Jada, herself despite her devastating injuries

Jada was born by cesarean section weighing just over three pounds.

The young mother wanted nothing more to fight her tragic circumstances and raise baby Jada herself, but on Wednesday she tragically lost that battle and died in a Louisiana hospital, reports the Houston Chronicle.  

She had spent months at TIRR Memorial Hermann in Houston for her rehabilitation and had last month moved to a nursing home in her hometown of Crowley.

She had apparently developed a respiratory infection and was transferred to American Legion Hospital, where she died.

'She was such an amazing young woman and an amazing young mother,' Kristen Soudelier, a social worker at Memorial Hermann-The Texas Medical Center, told the Chronicle.

'She wanted Jada so bad, and wanted her to be healthy. I think she struggled and was strong for Jada all along.'

Jada's birth and Chyna's efforts to become a mother despite her injuries became an inspirational story for many.

'I just want to play with Jada,' she told the Chronicle last month as she prepared to leave TIRR. 'I'm so happy when I see her.'

At the time of the shooting, Chyna was preparing to begin classes at McNeese State University and had hoped to become a nurse.

Instead, she spent the next seven months relearning basic skills - breathing without a respirator, eating and using a mouth-stick to work a laptop.

Her mother, Sherry Yokum, had taken Jada home to Crowley in November and Chyna had hoped to join her daughter.

But doctors felt she still needed round the clock care and she was moved into the nursing home.

Jailed: Patrick Guillory, 22, shot Chyna and left her paralysed from the neck down three days after her 18th birthday

Acadia Parish coroner Dr. Mark Dawson told the Chronicle that he had not yet delivered a verdict on the cause of death.

Even though a respiratory infection may have been the immediate cause, Dawson said, 'I'm sure it was a complication of the gunshot.'

Guillory pleaded guilty to attempted murder and was sentenced to 40 years in prison for the shooting. He could face more charges if the cause of the death is linked to the shooting.

Crowley police said the motive for the attack was unclear and it was not known by them if Guillory is Jada's father.

K.P. Gibson, Chief of Crowley Police, said: 'As far as we are aware a paternity test has not been carried out. Guillory did not cooperate during our investigation so we don't know what his motive was.'

Guillory had forced his way into Chyna's mother's home on the night of the shooting, Ms Yokum had tried to hold him back and screamed at her daughter to 'run'.

After pistol whipping her mother, Guillory chased his pregnant ex-girlfriend through the street and fired his gun four times. Her mother later found her choking on her own blood in a neighbours garden.

Soudelier told the Chronicle that Chyna's death had had an impact on everyone who had worked with Chyna.

'She allowed us to be part of her life, and to be part of Jada's life,' said Soudelier.

'I was with her in the delivery room, and everything she was worried about was for Jada, not for herself.'
