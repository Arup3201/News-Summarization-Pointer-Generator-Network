'Vindicated': Stephen Perry has been cleared of seven sexual offences 

An insurance boss accused of hiring attractive teenage girls to ogle and grope has been cleared of seven sexual offences. 

Stephen Perry denied sexually assaulting two 17-year-olds when they worked for him at his Rotherham business throughout a trial at Sheffield Crown Court.

The 58-year-old widow was today found not guilty of seven sexual offences against the two women but admitted some of his behaviour 'could have been taken in the wrong way'. rothe

Speaking after the case, Mr Perry said he felt 'vindicated' by the outcome of the trial. 

'I feel I have been vindicated. These allegations were unfounded and I told the police as much.  

'I am a friendly man and one of them described me as a fatherly figure which is about right. I encouraged a friendly, relaxed atmosphere at work and they misconstrued things.' 

The insurance chief added he would not hire teenagers to work at his firm in the future.  

'I have made the decision like Lionel Blair once said that I'm not going to work with children any more. 

'I now employ two 45-year-old women in the office who work for me.'

During the trial it was alleged Mr Perry told recruitment managers to hire 'cracking' young women and that he liked employees 'young and fresh'. 

Sean Kilbride, who supplied candidates to the business, told jurors Mr Perry had instructed him: ''If they’re cracking, they’ll get the job, you know what I mean,' before adding he liked employees 'young and fresh'. 

'He told me he was looking for 16 and 17-year-olds, preferably a girl,' Mr Kilbride said. 

One of the women alleged he grabbed her from behind while she was bent over in front of a filing cabinet, while the other claimed she felt 'uncomfortably' with the 'touchy, feely' boss. 

'He was eyeing me up and down. I felt uncomfortable. I was trying to shrug it off, it was disgusting. He had his tongue out and was staring at me

'He said: "Don’t ever come to work in a skirt and glasses because I will not be held responsible for my actions if we are left alone."' 

Mr Perry denied the allegations, insisting he had a 'fatherly' relationship with the two women and that there was no sexual motive behind his behaviour towards them.

Accused of putting his hands over one of the girl's faces so that she would not see what was on his computer screen, he said: 'I don’t know where that’s come from.' 

Both were 17 when they worked for Mr Perry in 2012 and 2013. They were sent to the company where they earned £100-a-week as apprentice clerks, but quit after a few months.

During their interviews the women claimed Mr Perry quizzed them on whether or not they had boyfriends and 'oohed' at one woman's bottom in the office. 

On one occasion one of the women claimed he grabbed her from behind and 'rubbed' his crotch against her. 

This was strong denied by Mr Perry throughout. 

Jurors took 40 minutes to clear him of all seven charges brought. 

Speaking after the trial, the widow said: 'In hindsight I probably did say things that could have been taken the wrong way,' adding he 'may have comforted' one of the women in 'a fatherly manner' by patting her bottom.

The only other contact was when he put his hands on one of their shoulders while she was working at a computer to poke fun at her height, he said. 

Mr Perry admitted to observing one of the women had 'big' breasts but did not touch them, and says he may have 'touched' her thigh instead of slapping it as accused. 

She was hired, he insisted, on the basis of her CV but that he once had to tell her off for coming to work in what he thought was an inappropriate blouse.

At the time of the alleged assaults, Mr Perry's wife was dying of cancer, it was heard.
