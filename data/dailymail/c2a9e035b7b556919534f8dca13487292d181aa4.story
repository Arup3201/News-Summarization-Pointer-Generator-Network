Oh Kate, what were you thinking?

While the rest of the royal party sensibly opted for a muted palette, determined not to outshine the woman at the centre of it all, the Duchess of Cambridge opted for a scarlet dress so bold and bright it just screamed: ‘Look at me!’

For a moment, she could have been confused with the Chelsea Pensioners’ guard of honour. But, no, it was Kate in an outfit as striking as it was inappropriate.

Lady in red: The Duchess of Cambridge cut a swathe through the gloomy weather this afternoon as she stepped on to the Spirit of Chartwell wearing a vibrant scarlet Alexander McQueen dress - on her lapel, Kate wore a maritime-themed brooch featuring two silver dolphins. It's a gift from the Royal Navy Submarine Service of which William is Commodore in Chief

Yes, it drew gasps from the crowd, but 
that was precisely the problem. For if ever there was an occasion when 
Kate should have opted for a more subdued look, then this was surely it.

Throughout her first year as a member of the Royal Family, Kate has 
hardly put a fashionably shod foot wrong. Her wedding gown was 
tremblingly beautiful and sophisticated.

Since then she has cleverly combined High Street with designer clothes: 
fashionable but never a fashionista, classic, conservative, sometimes 
demure. 
So why, on the second most important occasion in her public life, did 
she opt for an outfit more suited to Ladies’ Day at Aintree alongside 
Coleen Rooney than beside Her Majesty at her Diamond Jubilee pageant?

An
 outfit, indeed, that in its sleeveless version was previously worn by 
reality TV star Kim Kardashian and The X Factor judge Tulisa 
Contostavlos.

Private joke: The Duchess of Cambridge, Catherine shares a laugh with Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall

Keeping cover: The Duchess opted for a large red umbrella as rain continued to fall

It says something when even Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice were more appropriately attired than the usually immaculate Kate. 

I blame her family. Not the Royals, but the Middletons.

Apparently, the Middleton women, now a bewildering presence at all royal
 occasions, had decided to do a ‘red, white and blue’ theme between 
sisters and mother, with Carole in white, Pippa in blue and Kate in 
crimson.

Put together, they no doubt looked like a jolly string of bunting. But, 
for heaven’s sake, this wasn’t a promotional shoot for their online 
party business, it was a formal royal function.

Family loyalty is one thing, Kate, but you’re part of a much bigger, more important family now.

I realise it must be incredibly difficult to have the eyes of the world 
upon her and every outfit scrutinised. But she is clever enough to know 
by now what impact her choice of outfit can have on a public occasion; 
how every little detail can speak volumes.

She also has the best 
advisers in the land, not least the Royal Family themselves. Unlike with
 Diana, they have done everything to make her feel part of the family 
and to help her understand what is required of her.

Kate’s advisers have always let it be known that she and William wanted 
to be low-key royals. We were told they wanted a quiet, normal, married 
life while they were based in a small cottage in Wales. If so, then 
yesterday was a curious way of showing it.

Let us be charitable and 
assume it was never Kate’s intention to steal the limelight from the 
Queen, and she was simply badly advised. 

But there’s a lesson in there for her.  Yes, she looked stunning. But when in the Queen’s company, less is definitely more. 

Ultimately, nothing — not even a scarlet Duchess — could outshine our 
diamond sovereign. But please, Kate, if you’re planning a sexy pink 
number for the service of thanksgiving tomorrow — think again!
