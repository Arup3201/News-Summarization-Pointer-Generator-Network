Lewis Hamilton is fuelling up for his Formula One title charge.

Fresh from finishing second at the Brazilian Grand Prix, the British star and his long-term girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger, raided the supermarket aisles.

Hamilton is 17 points ahead of Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg with just one round, the season finale in Abu Dhabi in less than a fortnight’s time, remaining.

And after touching down in London on Monday, Hamilton wasted no time in replenishing his food stock w

‘Great to be back in London,’ Hamilton said. ‘Just been out grocery shopping with my lady helping her move into her new spot.’

Hamilton knows a top-two finish at the final round in Abu Dhabi will guarantee him his second title, but it is the unpredictability of the sport which means he cannot rest on his laurels.

'There is zero comfort going into the last race,' said Hamilton, who, without the controversial double points ruling, would bee able to claim his second drivers’ championship with a sixth-placed finish.

Rosberg celebrates his victory at the Brazilian Grand Prix on Sunday; his first win since July's German GP 

'There are 50 points to gain, which has never happened in Formula One before, and it just so happens to be this season.

'In the last race you never know what is going to happen, so I'm going into it to win.'

Hamilton's positive mindset means he is refusing to contemplate for a moment the possibility he may not be crowned champion.

'Why would I think that? It's not the way to approach any race weekend,' he said.
