A teenage burglar has been spared prison on condition that he helps his mother with some light housework.

Jamie Froom, 18, was told he  can stay out of jail if he makes his bed, does the washing-up and is nice to his parents.

The drug-user admitted breaking into two houses after he had left his family home following a series of rows. But he was allowed to walk free from court – despite accepting that he deserved a jail sentence – after he agreed to move back in with his parents and help around the house.

Not too harsh: Froom will have to complete 120 hours of unpaid community service and six months of drugs rehabilitation as well as helping out at home

Judge David Ticehurst told him: ‘You can make your bed every day, do the washing-up and respect your mum and dad.’ The judge told Froom’s mother to let the court know if he does not pull his weight at home – and her son would be sent to prison.

After the hearing, Froom’s 35-year-old mother Melanie, a carer, said she approved of the sentence, which also included her son being ordered to do 120 hours of unpaid work and six months of drug rehabilitation.

The mother of five said: ‘I thought what the judge said was good.

‘I quite appreciated it. I felt the judge was on my side.’

Her son, however, was less welcoming of the verdict – and said it had given his mother an excuse to nag him.

He added yesterday: ‘I think he was a bit strict, saying I have to tidy my room or go to prison.

‘My mum and nan were at court and they completely agreed with him. I think I’m quite good around the house. I do my room and sometimes I do the washing. I can’t do anything today though, because I’ve got probation. Since the court case my mum has been on at me to do more. She’s been telling me to do the cleaning, wash the clothes and sort my room out.

‘I am going to try and do it though. I don’t want to go to prison.’

He then added: ‘To be honest, I think he should have sent me to prison for what I did.

Out of trouble: Froom will return to his family home, pictured, after he was caught along with two other youths as they fled the second house they had burgled

‘I’m going to keep out of trouble now. I don’t work, I did media studies at college but now I want to be a mechanic, like my dad.’

The court heard that Froom, from Bristol, had taken part in two burglaries in the city in April.

The owner of the first house returned to find property stolen and people fleeing the scene. Bristol Crown Court heard last week that in a raid on the second house three teenagers carrying stolen goods were caught as  they fled.

Nicholas Fridd, prosecuting, told the court: ‘All property was recovered, which included computer equipment, euros and a ring.’

Confession: Froom pleaded guilty to two daytime burglaries at Bristol Crown Court and will have to complete 120 hours unpaid work and six months of drug rehabilitation for cannabis use

Two youths aged 15 and 16 at the time pleaded guilty to their involvement and were sent to be dealt with at the youth court.

Froom’s sentence attracted condemnation yesterday.

David Davies, Tory MP for Monmouthshire, said: ‘It is an absolutely disgraceful sentence. People who commit burglaries should go to prison automatically.’
