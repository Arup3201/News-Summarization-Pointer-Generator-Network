Sepp Blatter is urging England to bid for the next World Cup in Europe, standing firm on Russia and Qatar as hosts for 2018 and 2022 and promising to speed up the introduction of more new technology.

The FIFA president approaches another four-year term in office promising to step up the fight against racism, with the imposition of punitive points deductions and expulsion from cup competitions.

He will use the awarding of a women’s tournament to Jordan as football’s instrument in the campaign for female equality in the Arab world. He reports, also, on how FIFA is working as a force for reconciliation between Israel and Palestine.

Head of the global game: Blatter spoke on a number of crucial issues surrounding world football

All this, and more, emerges from Blatter’s first major interview since Brazil 2014.

This exclusive discussion was conducted by me at FIFA headquarters in Zurich for premier screening to thousands of delegates at the opening of the SoccerEx Global Football Convention in Manchester on Monday morning.

Blatter expresses his profound delight at the success of Brazil 2014, as well as his gratitude to the Brazilian people for justifying his optimism that their love of the Beautiful Game would not let their socio-economic protests spoil ‘this great World Cup.’

He also reveals the multi-billion-dollar scale of FIFA’s income during this four-year World Cup cycle and its distribution of a high proportion of that wealth to aid the development of football around the world.

All-round success: Blatter was delighted with Brazil for a great World Cup, which was won by Germany

Coming home: Before a World Cup can be held in England it will likely visit Africa, as it did in 2010

Final venue? Wembley could host just its second World Cup final - after 1966 - if Blatter is to be believed

Michel Platini, it emerges, advised FIFA’s president in advance of his decision not to stand against his re-election next year, but to remain at the head of UEFA.

Thus Blatter predicts growing unity between the two bodies, totally discounting any possibility of star players with major European clubs ever boycotting the World Cup, ‘the high-point of their careers.’

That said, he went on to announce that he will formally confirm his candidacy for four more years in the next few weeks.

That may be the worst-kept secret in sport. But making it official for the first time enabled him to address the corruption accusations that have been dogging the governing body of the world game.

Friends? It now looks like Platini will not rival Blatter for the FIFA crown as he goes for re-election

In so doing Blatter offers a rare, personal insight into himself as a football-loving man, as he admits how deeply hurt he was by allegations in an English newspaper which attempted to connect him to any wrong-doing.

His reminder to the world that he has been totally exonerated is passionately delivered, as is his assurance that the independent investigation being led by New York lawyer Michael Garcia will be completely transparent and honest.

He asks only that all such deliberations and any critical discussions are conducted with mutual respect, not the heated discourtesy which he sees as having reflecting poorly on the game.

Experience: Wembley has hosted a Champions League final, an Olympic final and is in line for the big one

European choice: An English-held World Cup is possible in 2030 - but it might host Euro 2020's final too

On the English question, raised after Greg Dyke’s outburst against him at a FIFA convention in Brazil, Blatter makes it clear that he ‘likes’ the new FA chairman, holds no grudge and is sure he will be ‘respectful’ next time they meet.

He also urges Dyke to step back from vowing that England will never again bid for the World Cup while he is FIFA president. That statement was born of England’s angst at their high-profile bid team securing only one vote in the ballot for 2018 but Blatter says: ‘You have to be prepared to accept losing – and of course be ready to bid again.’

However, the earliest England could host the Finals is 2030.

Stunning vision: The stadiums in Qatar have been unveiled and all feature futuristic designs

Blatter expects that under the rotation system, Qatar will almost certainly be followed in 2026 by either an African contender, a joint staging by Uruguay and Argentina, or the USA following the huge TV audiences recorded in Ameriica for Brazil 2014.

Of the Qatar controversy, he explains ‘the need to take the World Cup to the Middle East for the first time’ and adds that FIFA are ‘totally committed’ to that decision. He confirms that the tournament will be moved to the cool of winter, although the precise timing will not be resolved until after discussions this week about re-scheduling the European club season that winter.

Still coming: No world stars, including the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, will boycott a World Cup, says Blatter

Of the Russia controversy, Blatter says that while FIFA will ‘continue to monitor’ the situation in Ukraine ‘we are already working with Russia to prepare for that World Cup.’

He also reasserts FIFA’s principle of resisting the interference of politics in football. Of the call by some EU ambassadors for a boycott, he says: ‘They never do any good.’

On the issue of racist abuse – be it evident in players, team officials or fans - he is urging the application of regulations already in place for points to be deducted or offending clubs to be thrown out of even the most important cups. While he admits that identifying offenders in crowds that can be infiltrated by rival fans, he anticipates extra security scrutiny and adds that ‘sometimes you have to take a chance’ to make progress.

Changes: Jose Mourinho and other manages could be handed the chance to appeal against referees' decisions

Blatter sees no risk in the next hi-tech step which will follow the success of goal-line technology. He is bringing forward trials for managers and coaches to be given two challenges in each half of a game against decisions. Referees will be engaged in the review process, going to the touchline as soon as play is stopped to study the video replays.

That innovation will be in place before the next World Cup.

Of the one just ended, he had ‘no doubts’ that Brazil’s stadia and infrastructure would be ready in time. He thanks all in that country for staying behind the Finals after their team were knocked out. He suspects, also, that the very decisive nature of Germany’s seven-goal victory helped the Brazilians accept that exit without complaint and continue enjoying a magnificent tournament.

Success: Blatter says he had 'no doubts' that Brazil would be ready in time for the World Cup last summer

That helped boost FIFA’s income from the World Cup cycle to £2.7billion ‘of which more than 70 per cent’ will be dispersed to Brazil and the nations in the Finals, or distributed among confederations and associations for the good of the game in all corners of the football world.

And all that is but a taste of a fascinating conversation.

The interview was filmed in one, unbroken take with no pauses for thought and no questions ducked.
