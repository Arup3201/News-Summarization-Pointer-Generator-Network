Many people dream of winning the lottery and quitting work forever - but not rising soap star Danny-Boy Hatchard.

Instead, the chirpy real-life cockney actor insists he wouldn't swap his dream roleÂ  as EastEnders' newest rogue Lee Carter for anything.

'Honestly, if you offered me a winning lottery ticket or the EastEnders job, I'd choose EastEnders,' he says. 'What am I going to do with money? I'd get bored and find a job anyway. And I like working on something I appreciate.'

Dann-Boy says that all the money in the world couldn't make him leave his dream role on EastEnders

Danny-Boy, 22, set his sights on an acting career after taking part in a school production of Oliver!. Later, the working-class lad from east London took any job going while waiting for a break.

'I had every job under the sun,' he says. 'On building sites, in restaurants, pubs, a flower stall, gardening - anything to earn a bit of money.'

While his parents, who split when he was very young, wanted him to become a carpenter or plumber, Danny-Boy wouldn't be dissuaded. 'I knew I'd get a break because I was persistent,' he says. 'I was willing to wait until my 50s.'

Fortunately, he didn't have to. Danny-Boy - who says his family came up with the unusual name in a moment of bizarre spontaneity - won plaudits last year on the West End stage in Beautiful Thing, alongside Suranne Jones.

Then this spring he was cast as squaddie Lee Carter, the on-screen son of his real-life acting hero Danny Dyer. Lee caused a stir from the start by bedding Lucy Beale before her murder. 'I grew up watching Lucy, but never thought I'd end up a suspect in her murder,' he says.

Danny-Boy says his first scene with Mick and Linda Carter was pretty special and that working with a legend like June Brown is amazing too

The only person more pleased to hear that Danny-Boy had landed the job was his No 1 fan - mum Simone, who promptly burst into tears.

This winter Danny-Boy will make his movie debut alongside Dyer's teenage daughter Dani in British gangster flick We Still Kill The Old Way, and admits he can't believe how his life is turning out.

'EastEnders is an amazing opportunity to learn from the greats - Danny Dyer, Timothy West, June Brown, Steve McFadden. I'm happier than I've ever been.'

Despite his success, Danny-Boy - who says he'd prefer to keep his love life private - appears to have his feet on the ground. 'I have a normal life; friends and family treat me the same as they've always done.'

Danny-Boy is using his raised profile to fight homophobia and regularly tweets on the subject. 'Where I grew up, being gay was unheard of and at school I was prejudiced,' he admits.

'When I was nine or ten I gave this lad a whack because he was gay - and he battered me! A few years later, after I'd grown up a lot, I apologised to him - and we've remained close friends since.

Peer pressure can change you into someone you don't want to be, like a bully. I nearly became one until I was strong enough to see it was wrong. I was disappointed in myself but I learned from it.

'Then at drama school I was surrounded by people of all cultures and sexualities, which showed me how important it is to be true to yourself, and not care what others think. They taught me a lot; the least I can do now is stand up for equal rights.'

Ideal holiday - Europe or America? America - I'd love to see some theatre in New York.

Pub food or restaurant? Pub food's great but as I'm on a diet I'd have a jacket potato or an omelette.

Beer or spirits? I like ales - especially Doom Bar from Cornwall.

Rugby or football? I'm a West Ham fan. I went to my first game with my dad when I was about four. My nan used to run a pub round the corner from their stadium.

Rock or dance music? I love bands like Oasis and Nickelback.

Monsters, Inc. or Toy Story? Definitely the Toy Story films - I grew up watching them.
