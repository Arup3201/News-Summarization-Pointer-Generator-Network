A section of guardrail has fallen from the 81st floor of New York's tallest residential building - prompting local officials to bring construction work to a halt.

The 8ft piece of metal plummeted from a hoist during work on the luxury 1,396ft (426m) 432 Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan on Wednesday.

It landed in front of the main entrance of a building across 56th Street, the department but nobody was injured.

The city's Department of Buildings put a 'stop work' order in place on the 96-storey condo that is set to become the tallest residential building in the Western Hemisphere when it is completed.

Close: The piece fell from the luxury residential building - which boats some of the best views of downtown Manhattan and beyond - and landed in front of an adjacent building. Officials said no one was injured

However it has now been rescinded after the machinery involved was investigated.  

It is not the first time however that someone working on the site has been in danger. 

In March 2013, a construction worker was injured at 432 Park Avenue when a pallet of wood fell on his leg. 

The dangerous accident also recalls One57’s crane collapse during Hurricane Sandy in 2012 which forced residents nearby to evacuate for a week. 

Designed by architect Rafael Viñoly, the  condo, which is due to be finished this year, offers 104 units, ranging in price from $16.95million to a whopping $95million penthouse suite.

Astonishingly, it towers over the Empire State Building (1,250ft), the Chrysler Building (1,046ft) and One World Trade Center without its spire (1,368ft).

The units, all built over 365 feet and designed by Deborah Berke, also feature 12.5-foot ceilings, solid oak flooring and Italian marble countertops.

And the rest of the building is just as impressive - with climate-controlled wine cellars, an outdoor terrace, a spa, a 'massage therapy room' and a pool. 

In the luxury accommodation residents can also frequent a billiards room, dine in a restaurant underneath a crystal chandelier, socialise in a lounge and keep fit in a private gym.

The building, which sits between 56th and 57th Streets, first underwent excavation work on September 26, 2011, followed by three years of construction.
