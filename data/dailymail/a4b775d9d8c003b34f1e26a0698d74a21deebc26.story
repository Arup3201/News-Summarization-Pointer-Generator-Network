A Manhattan photographer who snapped pictures of his neighbors as they dwelled inside their own apartments and turned them into high-priced art is fighting back against privacy lawsuit as his blown up prints hit a New York City gallery.

Not too far from his own apartment in the Tribeca neighborhood, photographer Arne Svenson’s work is now onsale at the Julie Saul Gallery in Chelsea for up to $7,500. Meanwhile, some subjects of his work are unhappy they’re naps and other everyday acts have been transformed into art without their consent.

Svenson, who says his neighbors are ‘performing behind a transparent scrim on a stage of their own creation with the curtain raised high,’ has filed a motion to dismiss legal complaints that he’s broken the law.

Uncomfortably close: Arne Svenson secretly took shots of his neighbors doing everyday things like napping in their own homes with a zoom lens. His work now hangs in a New York gallery and some of his subjects are unhappy

The photographer says he 'started the 
project after inheriting a telephoto lens from a friend. He began taking
pictures of the large-windowed apartments opposite his own Tribeca home
in 2012.

Those images 
are now on show, which prompted a legal complaint from Martha and 
Matthew Foster, parents of young children featured in two of his 
photographs.

The Fosters
said the pictures raised concerns about the safety of their children as
well as fears that they ‘must keep their shades drawn at all hours of 
the day in order to avoid telephoto photography by a neighbor.’

Aptly named: The exhibit, called 'The Neighbors' hands at New York City's Julie Saul gallery

Doubly awkward: When Svenson's work showed up at Julie Saul Gallery, the parents of two children who appeared in the exhibit complained and those photos have since been removed

Whose right? Svenson took pictures of the dwellers of this Tribeca apartment building. One couple now demands his photos of their household be removed from the artist's possession

For
the rest of New York, the controversy over the exhibition has triggered
a conversation about First Amendment rights and just how much privacy 
city dwellers can expect.

In
the latest development, Svenson is claiming he’s done nothing wrong. On
Wednesday, his attorney filed a motion calling for the New York county 
court to throw out the Fosters' complaint. The motion argues that the 
pictures are not illegal and are protected under an artist's freedom of 
expression under First Amendment rights.

Svenson
is no longer commenting on the controversy, but says in his exhibition 
notes: ‘For my subjects, there is no question of privacy… The neighbors 
don't know they are being photographed; I carefully shoot from the 
shadows of my home into theirs.’

The
photographs themselves are both abstract and specific, capturing 
mundane but intimate moments of domestic modern life. All are carefully 
framed to avoid revealing the full faces of their subjects.

A
woman in a raincoat stands by the window, her face obscured by a 
twisted gold curtain. A man in T-shirt and jeans dozes on a sofa. An 
expectant mother is pictured in profile. The lower halves of a couple in
bath robes are caught breakfasting, their feet touching under the 
table. Another woman is crouched near the window, scrubbing the floor or
picking something off the ground.

Obscured? 'For my subjects, there is no question of privacy,' Svenson says. 'The neighbors don't know they are being photographed; I carefully shoot from the shadows of my home into theirs.'

The
Fosters' complaint details the couple's distress about two photos that 
feature their children. One image shows Martha Foster holding her 
2-year-old son, with her 4-year-old daughter standing beside her. The 
girl is in a swim suit; the boy is wearing a diaper. The document 
alleges that the minors' faces are ‘clearly recognizable,’ which could 
endanger their safety by attracting the attention of ‘undesirable and 
potentially dangerous people.’

Svenson's
legal motion of June 5 asserts that neither his conduct nor photographs
violate any New York laws. The document adds that as the images ‘were 
taken through windows that are fully exposed to the street, they cannot 
support a claim for intentional infliction of severe emotional 
distress.’

With regard 
to the photos that feature the Fosters, the motion states that the faces
of the parents are not revealed, the children are obscured and the 
subjects are in plain view. ‘Both photographs capture children at play 
and the innocence of childhood, nothing more revealing than you might 
see in a neighborhood park,’ the document says. It asserts that 
Svenson's images are protected by First Amendment rights and that the 
‘Plaintiffs should not be permitted to use the Court to attempt to 
restrict artistic expressions that they disagree with.’

The
plaintiffs say they are ‘frightened and angered’ by the ‘utter 
disregard for their privacy and the privacy of their children’ and the 
‘seclusion and solitude of their homes.’

The
complaint adds that Svenson's conduct is ‘so out of keeping with the 
standards of morality in the community as to evince an intentional or 
reckless disregard of its likelihood to cause severe emotional distress 
to the Fosters.’

Although Svenson removed the pictures 
from the exhibition when contacted by an attorney, the Fosters still 
want to remove all remaining pictures from the photographer's 
possession, a permanent injunction against further photographic 
intrusions, plus damages and costs.

Julie Saul, the gallery owner and 
director, told Reuters that the reaction to the exhibition was a ‘huge 
surprise’ and a ‘tempest in a teapot.’

Compensation: A woman takes her own picture at Svenson's exhibit. The Foster family is suing him for intruding on their privacy, want photos of their children returned, as well damages and costs

‘It really never occurred to me that 
there would any of the controversial issues surrounding the work because
historically there have been lots and lots of photographers who have 
photographed on the street, through windows, there's a whole history of 
it,’ she said.

Mickey Osterreicher, an attorney and 
general counsel for the National Press Photographers Association, 
described the case as ‘very interesting.’

‘Most people have this sense in New York because everybody lives so close together, because the line sights are such, that you can very easily look into your neighbors' apartment and they can look into yours, but I think the court may parse this out as looking is one thing and photographing is another,’ he told Reuters.

Unanticipated: Gallery owner Julie Saul speaks with guests at her gallery June 1. 'It really never occurred to me that there would any of the controversial issues'

Osterreicher is concerned that a ruling in this case could ‘create more pushback by people who are looking to create an expectation of privacy even when you're out in public.’ He thinks this could lead to First Amendment protections being ‘chipped away.’ Osterreicher believes that this case has been a negative one for the image of photography and First Amendment rights due to the ‘bad taste’ that has been left with the public. The attorney believes that the case against Svenson may ‘turn more on the facts of the case than on the actual law.’

While the case remains in the hands of the New York State Justice system, the issues raised by Svenson's photographs are as ethical as they are legal. Saul said: ‘If it's an ethical issue I think it's about the individual, and the way that Arne has handled this work is incredibly respectful and ethical.’

Clearly, others disagree.

Pricey: Pieces in Svenson's collection are garnering upwards of $7,500
