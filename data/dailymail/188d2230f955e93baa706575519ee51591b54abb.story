An obese and bedraggled cat  found abandoned at the roadside is battling his huge bulge using water treadmill treatments.

King Leo had severely matted fur and weighed a staggering 30lb when he was found abandoned on the side of the road in Nashville, Tennessee.

The ten-year-old Maine Coon cat was heard meowing inside a carrier case by a driver who had pulled over with a flat tire.

Part of Leo's slimming plan involves pounding the water treadmill - a treatment many cats would find daunting

The thick and tangled fur had been severely restricting Leo's ability to move or extend his back legs

Leo is now settled with his new family who are devoted to helping the cat reach a healthy weight

Leo's rescuer took the cat to Metro Animal Care and Control, and was later transported to Cat Shoppe Rescue where his raggedy hair was shaved and he embarked on a rigorous weight loss regime.

The thick and tangled fur had been severely restricting the cat's ability to move, with mats on the belly preventing Leo from being able to extend his back legs.

A note found inside Leo's carrier revealed that the cat had been abandoned at least once before, when his first owners handed him over to a new family. 

Part of the feline's slimming plan involves pounding the water treadmill - a treatment many cats would find daunting but one that King Leo has taken in his stride.

King Leo fast became a firm favourite with volunteers and staff at Animalia Health and Wellness. 

Leo has found a forever home with a vet technician who had been caring for him at Animalia animal center

LaTisha describes Leo as a wonderful, fun-loving cat who is always ready to play or have a tummy rub

Veterinary technician, LaTisha Lampley, 34, chose to adopt the flabby feline after caring for him at the center and becoming attached to his lovable personality.

LaTisha, from Spring Hill, Tennessee said: 'He is the biggest cat of his size frame with that much weight on him that I've seen.

'King Leo is a wonderful, fun loving cat - he is ready to play, and loves to roll over and have his belly rubbed.'

Leo's severely matted fur meant that he had had to have over 2lbs of the stuff shaved off.

LaTisha was impressed at how well King Leo has taken to his new diet and fitness regime

LaTisha said: 'Not every house cat would allow you to shave their fur because it is uncomfortable.

'He was willing to just lay there and let us clip him, it was like he knew he was getting relief.'

The cat's health is now being monitored, with updates on King Leo's progress being posted on his Facebook page.

LaTisha has been impressed with her new pet's progress in his physical therapy sessions and hopes it won't be long until he reaches a healthy weight.

She said: 'As soon as we put him in the water, he started walking on the treadmill like he had been doing it for days.' 

The family has combined Leo's rigorous exercise regime with a strict diet to help the cat shed the pounds.

LaTisha added: 'We are going to monitor his caloric intake and incorporate some exercise, play time and some more strenuous exercise.'
