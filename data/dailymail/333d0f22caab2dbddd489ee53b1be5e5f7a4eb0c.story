A multi-million pound project to replace street lights with LED lamps has left residents in a London borough feeling like they're 'living on a football pitch'.

Hounslow Council started installing the ultra-bright lights to improve the area's roads last year.

But homeowners in Park Road, Chiswick, and the surrounding areas have complained their evenings are ruined by the dazzling light pouring through their windows.

They say the lamps are causing them sleepless nights, and have now resorted to methods used during the Blitz to keep the light out.

The lights are more cost effective and burn less electricity, and give a more directional light, meaning less light pollution.

But Kristina Fearnley said she has to 'seal up her Venetian blinds with ducktape daily' to dim the light out.

She told BBC: 'The light that comes through side of the blinds is like a great big spot light beaming into your face as you try to relax with your family in the evenings.

And AndyRichards added: 'We've had to resort to this black cardboard that we bought so it masks the window - a bit like Wolrd War Two.'

When they were installed, residents also complained that the LED lights are not in keeping with the character of their roads, which is in a conservation area.

Cllr Colin Ellar, deputy leader of Hounslow Council said: 'It is true that a small number of residents have told us that our new street lights are too bright and that their sleep has been disturbed, which is something I can fully sympathise with.

'Many residents have also said how happy they are with the new standard of lighting in their street.

'It is possible to dim the new lights and we will be carrying out a trial soon.

'The new lights do, however, help save energy, save council taxpayersâ€™ money and have been recognised by the police as helping the fight against crime because of the better quality light.'

The lights are part of a 25-year borough-wide Â£800â€‰million renovation being carried out by private contractor Hounslow Highways. The first lights were installed in 2013, as part of a two year scheme to replace all street lights with LED lamps.

At the time, Hounslow Highways said the brightness will be adjusted and centrally controlled.
