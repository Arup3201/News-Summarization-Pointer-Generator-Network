Compared to his legs, this frog's arms do look a bit puny.

So, it appears, he decided to use a plant stem to do a full work out to beef them up a bit.

The White's tree frog spent 10 minutes pulling himself up on the stem and easing down again.

Finally the small amphibian climbed onto the stem and was able to rest.

Amateur photographer Hendy Mp took pictures of the frog in a friend's back garden in Sambas, Indonesia.

The 25-year-old, who works in a mobile phone shop, said he spotted the frog lazily pulling himself up on the stem of a tuber.

He said: 'I was watching the frog for about 10 minutes in my friend's garden. It seemed to be a funny frog, climbing very slowly and then letting himself fall back down.

'What he was doing reminded me of a sportsman doing fitness exercises, but maybe a bit lazily.

'I felt so satisfied I could capture these moments - they really tell a story about the frog.'

White's tree frogs, also known as green tree frogs, typically grow to 4in long.

Because they can look rather portly they are also known as 'dumpy tree frogs'.
