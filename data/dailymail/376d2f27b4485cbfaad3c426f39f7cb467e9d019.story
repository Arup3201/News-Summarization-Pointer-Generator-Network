The Government has spent £80,000 of taxpayers’ cash flying Eastern European vagrants back to their homelands – only for many to return weeks later.

More than 200 people were flown back to Romania and Bulgaria in the first three months of this year – using tickets paid for by the Home Office, according to figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. The migrants returned to Eastern Europe after a crackdown ordered by David Cameron on foreign EU nationals begging or sleeping rough in the UK.

London landmarks such as Marble Arch and Park Lane have been blighted by gangs of Romanian beggars setting up makeshift camps, dumping rubbish and urinating in the street.

There have also been increases in the levels of aggressive begging, pickpocketing and prostitution.

But now it has emerged that Romanian beggars who have been deported are returning using different names. A police officer based in the Marble Arch area, who asked to remain anonymous, said: ‘We’ve been informed that they are getting an identity card but changing the name, although the number stays the same. So now we check the number as well as the name.’

Jack Gordon, chairman of the Hyde Park safer neighbourhood panel, said he too was aware of deported Romanians returning just weeks later. He said: ‘Some of them have been banned from this country and they come back using false identities. It’s a waste of money. We need to have a border regime that is efficient and effective and doesn’t let these people come sliding back in.’

Last month it emerged that the number of Romanian migrants sleeping rough in some of London’s most exclusive districts had tripled since the EU restrictions on their movements were lifted. The problem became so extreme that Westminster council held talks with Home Office officials last month.

Last night, critics of the free flights accused the Government of wasting taxpayers’ money. Alp Mehmet, vice-chairman of Migration Watch UK, said: ‘This strikes me as a colossal waste of money because there’s no control over who comes back.

‘There’s only a very light check in 
respect of those coming from the EU into this country. So it doesn’t 
surprise me that there’s anecdotal evidence of Romanians coming back 
when they know they’ll get a free ride again back to their own country.’

Conservative MP Mark Reckless, a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee, which deals with immigration issues as well as other areas of Home Office policy, said providing free flights was far from ideal but the best option in the circumstances. He added: ‘Taxpayers would be better served if we didn’t spend their money on this.’

New powers came into force in the New Year allowing the British authorities to remove and ban EU migrants from the country for 12 months if they are found to be vagrants or don’t have a job.

A Home Office spokesman said: ‘No EU national has unrestricted access to the UK. Those who are found to be abusing their free movement rights are given every opportunity to leave voluntarily.

‘However, if they consistently refuse this support, are destitute and cannot demonstrate that they have a right to reside in the UK, our only option is to enforce their removal.’
