The tycoon at the centre of the breast implant scandal has been charged with 'unintentional harming' and could still face manslaughter charges after being arrested by French police.

Detectives seized Jean-Claude Mas, founder of Poly Implant Prothese, in a dawn swoop at his home in Six-Foursles-Plages, near Toulon.

A former PIP director, Claude Couty, was also arrested in a raid on his home in nearby La Seyne-sur-Mer.

The pair were questioned by detectives over the global health scare caused by a spate of ruptures of the cut-price implants.

Following a day of interviews, Mas complained of heart problems but had 
otherwise ‘been very cooperative’, his lawyer Yves Haddad said last night.

He added that Mas had 'answered hundreds of questions about his responsibility’ for 
the scandal.

He also confirmed Mas was charged with unintentional wounding and still faced a manslaughter case against him.

Up to 500,000 women around the world 
are believed to have received PIP implants, 40,000 of them British – 
including thousands of breast cancer victims.

Mas, 72, has not been seen in public 
since the scandal surfaced last month. But he caused outrage when he 
described women taking legal action against him as ‘money grabbers’ on 
French radio.

Shut down: PIP closed in March 2010 after regulators found it was using a non-medical grade silicone in its implants

PIP was shut down and its products 
banned in 2010 after it was revealed to have been using industrial-grade
silicone gel, which seemed to cause high rupture rates.

Britain's department of health says
there is no 'urgent need' for the country's 50,000 women fitted with 
PIP implants to have them removed.

Around 3,000 of them were NHS patients who had the implants fitted after breast cancer surgery.

All are filled with industrial 
chemicals, including those used as fuel additives or for the manufacture
of industrial rubber tubing, and are liable to split open.

Research suggests there is a 7 per cent rupture rate in Britain.

Health Secretary Andrew Lansley has 
ordered a review of the data amid speculation he would order mass 
removal of the implants, which were among the cheapest on the market.

The British Association of Aesthetic
Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) says the implants are not fit to be in the 
human body and so should be removed, whatever the rupture rate.

France is paying up to £60million 
for women to have the implants removed, with health secretary Xavier 
Bertrand saying 'the gel used was truly contaminated'.

An ITV News investigation revealed Mas
earned up to £180,000 a year from his company after it was launched in 
1991, despite warnings about the implants as early as 2005.

Fears spread globally late last year after French health authorities advised 30,000 women to have PIP implants removed.

Last night, British victims welcomed 
the arrest. Former model Vanessa Halstead, who started the Justice For 
PIP Victims campaign after her implant swelled and exploded, said: ‘The 
arrest is welcome news for the many women who have been suffering.’

Mas, who has two £1million properties 
in the South of France and Luxembourg, could still be charged with involuntary
manslaughter, which carries a maximum five-year jail term and heavy 
fines.

He is also under investigation for alleged fraud.

Interpol has said he is also wanted in Costa Rica over a drink-driving charge dating back to June 2010.

The UK Government has said patients 
who had their surgery on the NHS will be able to have the implants 
removed and replaced for free.

The NHS will also pay to remove, but not replace, implants if a private clinic refuses or no longer exists.
