A woman arrested for allegedly using a realistic baby doll to gain access to a maternity ward claims she was only trying to see if the hospital would be interested in buying one.

Merced, Calif., police tell Mail Online local woman Tonya Whitney was taken into custody after being seen with her husband in the Mercy Medical Center carrying the dolls on two separate occasions.

According to the police report: 'Whitney explained her purpose was not to trespass or steal any of the infants, but to show her life-like babies to the nursing staff in the hopes they would purchase some for training.'

Tonya Whitney was arrested for trespassing after police say she and her husband (unnamed) used realistic baby dolls to sneak into a hospital

The investigation remains underway and her husband is considered a witness by police, though he has not been charged.

Whitney and her husband first appeared in the hospital emergency room carrying the dolls on Saturday.

They appeared again on Monday and the woman was able to reach the maternity ward on the second floor by 'unknown means.'

Police say Whitney infiltrated the place with a baby carrier holding a doll and a diaper bag.

The Merced Sun-Star reported that a nurse called security on the couple, and both the woman and the man - who was waiting downstairs for her - were escorted out of the hospital.

Whitney told officers she only wanted to try and sell the hospital her doll as a training tool

The unidentified pair left before police arrived.

Whitney was reportedly wearing a nurse's uniform including the log-in sticker she obtained when she came to the hospital on Saturday.

Mercy Medical Center spokesman Bob McLaughlin said that he's never heard of anyone trying to get into a maternity ward using fake babies before.

'We do not know why they were in the hospital,' he told The Merced Sun-Star.

McLaughlin said the hospital's security worked as expected during the incident.
