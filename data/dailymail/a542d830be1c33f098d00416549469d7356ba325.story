Apple's Asian suppliers have reportedly started mass production of a new tablet computer smaller than the iPad, raising expectations that the tech giant is set to unveil it's iPad mini within weeks.

South Korean firm LG Display and AU Optronics of Taiwan began mass production of the smaller LCD screens for the new gadget last month, executives at the component makers said.

The report by The Wall Street Journal comes as rumours intensified that Apple was preparing to launch its new tablet within weeks to fend of competition from rivals.

Leaked? This image purports to show a black anodised unibody shell for Apple's forthcoming iPad Mini

Different colour schemes: This white front plate component suggests that consumers will have a choice of colours to choose from when they buy their new version of the iPad

The leak comes as two new images purporting to show case components for the new, smaller iPad were published by a Ukrainian iPhone fansite.

The images show a previously seen black anodised version of the gadget's unibody shell, as well as a white front panel, suggesting the iPad mini will come in similar colour schemes as the iPhone 5.

The positioning of the ports on the leaked images correlates with previous leaks and rumours about the hotly anticipated device.

The Wall Street Journal cited unnamed 'executives at component makers' which claimed mass production had begun of 'a new tablet computer smaller than the current iPad'.

Two sources said the new tablet will have a 7.85in liquid-crystal display with a lower resolution than the latest full-size iPad, which was released in March. 

Apple is expected to introduce the iPad mini on October 17th - just a week before arch rival Amazon launches its Fire range of tablets in the UK.

The announcement will see Apple go 
head to head with Amazon, Google and Barnes & Noble, which last week
announced its own Nook tablets.

The iPad Mini, a shrunken version
of Apple's market-changing tablet, is expected to be available in shops on November 2.

The Mini launch comes as research suggests a quarter of us - 22 per 
cent - own a tablet, with another three per cent regularly borrowing 
someone else's tablet for web browsing.

About 68 per cent of the 9,5123 adults surveyed said they purchased their tablet within the last year.

The U.S. survey by the Pew Research Center also suggests the flood of
cheaper tablets, such as the Google Nexus or Amazon Fire, are weakening
Apple's grip on the market.

A year ago, Apple had more than 80 per cent of the market, but this has now dropped to less around 52 per cent.

The Kindle Fire has 21 per cent of the market, meanwhile Samsung's Galaxy tablet has eight per cent.

Out of those surveyed, 44 per cent of adults who said they have a 
smartphone, 46 per cent have an Android phone, 38 per cent, have an 
iPhone and 10 per cent have a Blackberry.

The launch date was reported by Fortune magazine, which cites Apple investors hearing the date from 'multiple sources'.

The
device is believed to have similar hardware to last year's iPad 2, but 
reduced to a pocket-friendly seven or eight-inch form.

Fortune reports that Apple will send 
out invites for the launch on October 10, gathering tech journalists and
stakeholders together to unveil the device.

If Apple follows previous form, the event will be held in San Francisco, with a simultaneous launch on London.

Images purporting to show the iPad 
Mini suggest a device measuring 7.85inches, with an aluminium back-cover
similar to the most recent iPad.

It is likely to sport a rear-facing 
camera and come with Apple's newest 'lightning' connector, a 
controversial re-design which made previous accessories and chargers 
obsolete without an adapter.

If Apple follows its usual design 
styles, it is likely to come in white and black versions, with a choice 
of WiFi only, or a 3G option. However this unconfirmed.

The device, while still likely to garner a premium price-tag, will help Apple compete with the burgeoning smaller tablet market.

The 7-inch Google Nexus tablet sells for £159 for the cheapest version, while Amazon is also producing a budget tablet range.

Steve Jobs was 
unconvinced that a smaller tablet would be a success, seeing it as a 
poor compromise between a tablet and a phone.

However Apple appears to have had a change of heart, particularly now that the tablet market has now matured.

One issue Apple might face by launching a Mini is a fragmentation in its core product lines.

Until the release of the iPhone 5, 
Apple's two product lines had kept the same screen resolution, meaning 
apps did not need redesigning for different devices, a problem that plagues the competing Android platform.

But with the increased screen size of
the iPhone 5, some apps now have a black border, at least until the 
developers update their apps, and this problem may now afflict Apple's 
tablets, depending on the final size of the Mini.

According to these images, the iPad Mini comes with dual speakers on the rim, as well as the newly-designed dock connector

However this is unlikely to cause 
much of a worry to either developers or customers, as most apps will be 
updated quickly and developers still only have a small number of devices
to consider, unlike Android which has hundreds of combinations of 
models, screen sizes and software versions.

Apple does not speak publicly on 
future devices, so the launch will not be confirmed until a minimalist 
white envelope arrives to the media, inviting them to meet the newest 
member of the Apple family.
