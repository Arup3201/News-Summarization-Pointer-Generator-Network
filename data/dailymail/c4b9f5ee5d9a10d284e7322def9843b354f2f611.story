This is the moment a stingray photobombed a family photograph at an aquarium - and it even appears to smile at the camera.

Robert and Emily Inman had taken their son Raphael, 2, for a day out at The Deep Aquarium in Hull, Yorkshire, to celebrate Robert's 30th birthday on Wednesday.

Little did they know when they were taking some pictures in front of one of the tanks a cheeky Stingray would make the most of the photo op.

Robert Inman and his son Raphael were enjoying a day out at Hull's The Deep Aquarium when they decided to take a family photograph - will hilarious consequences. The stingray even appears to be smiling down the lens for his starring moment

It wasn't until the family got home later that day they realised one of their pictures had been hijacked.

Emily, 26, a florist, from Lincoln, said: 'It was really funny, I wasn't looking through the pictures until later that day I suddenly saw it.

'Our son was enjoying the fish and we were taking pictures of everything.

'I took three in a row and deleted one before noticing this. We were in stitches.

'I don't have that much time on my 
hands to pretend to have taken a picture.. This is definitely completely
 genuine and perfectly timed.'

Robert,
 30, an electrician, added: 'We really couldn't believe it - it is 
hilarious. We had a great day and this just finished it off.'

A spokesman from the aquarium said: 'The ray in the picture is a female Bluespotted Ray which are members of the shark family.

'We have recently had this female and another join us at The Deep in the hope that they will breed with our two males.

'They are very active in our tropical lagoon exhibit, their favourite food is peeler crab.

'What looks like eyes in the photograph are actually nostrils, their eyes are actually on top of their heads.'

A relative of the shark, Stingrays are most often found in temperate seas in shallow waters.

They are not active animals - and spend most of their time hiding in the sand, only moving when the tide sweeps them along.

They are sand-like in colour to match the seafloor - which helps them camouflage themselves so they are not attacked by larger predators.

While it may look as though their faces are located on their underside, like in the picture above, that area is actually the animal's mouth, nostrils and gill slits.

Their eyes are located on the top of their heads - peer out sidewards.

It is because of this that scientists believe their eyes aren't used a great deal in hunting.

Instead they use electtical sensors called ampullae of Lorenzini which are in their mouths. Like a shark, stingrays use these sensors to pick up on electrical charges of potential prey.
