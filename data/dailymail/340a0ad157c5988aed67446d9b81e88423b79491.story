A team of vets spent five hours shaving off two kilograms of matted, petrol-coated fur from the coat of a neglected dog whose owner dumped him at a rescue centre having never had him groomed. 

Bentley, a white Shih Tzu, was so timid when first taken into vets' care he flinched whenever a human tried to touch him.

He was dropped off at a dog rescue centre in Meltham, West Yorkshire, by an owner who 'couldn't bear to touch him,' volunteer Kathy Trout said. 

Bentley the Shih Tzu arrived at a dog rescue centre in Meltham, West Yorkshire, with fur so matted vets spent five hours shaving two kilograms of it off

Bentley's condition was so dire when he arrived at the centre, owner Kathy Trout was reduced to tears

After shaving off his matted hair, Bentley had to be sedated for vets to put a jacket over his tiny body.  

Now the three-year-old dog won't allow it to be removed. 

When he first arrived at the centre, Mrs Trout was reduced to tears by his condition. 

His coat was so covered in petrol, she said, a drink of water may have poisoned him if any fur had got in his mouth.  

'He came into our rescue from a member of the public. 

'His fur was very, very long and matted like felt and all his legs were like tree trunks with chemical smelling fur.

'It looked like he was thick with oil, fuel or petrol. He really, really stank.'

His owner, who arrived in a 'shiny 4x4' could not even bear to pick him up, she added. 

Vets had to sedate the dog to be able to shave off the mass of smelly, petrol-coated fur he arrived with

When Bentley arrived at the centre, his previous owner could not touch him, said Mrs Trout. Petrol and oil that was staining his coat meant the dog, who had never been groomed, gave off a strong stench

After spending time recovering at the centre, Bentley has overcome his fear of interaction with humans, and plays happily with the other dogs in its care

The dog will not allow any carers to remove a fleece jacket he now wears but is prone to giving kisses

'She handed him over on a lead because she wouldn't even touch him. It is clear he has never been groomed.

'Leaving him in this state is a prosecutable offence but I’m not interested in going to the police - all I want to do is make sure Bentley recovers,' Mrs Trout added.

The dog was so timid when he first arrived he became aggressive when humans tried to touch him. 

Vets were able to sedate him to shave off the matted fur before helping him overcome his fear of contact.  

'Now if I gently put my hand out, he will come to me and lick my face. It’s wonderful to see him so happy again.

'He’s running around with the other dogs and enjoying his food again - he’s put weight back on, too.

'Now he can’t stop drinking water - he goes to town on it because before his fur polluted the water when he tried to drink.

'He is still terrified if I move too close to him I have to wait for him to come to me. We put his little coat on while he was still under sedation and it hasn't been off since - it’s a strong velcro so I know he will flip if I try.'

The centre will be trying to find a new home for the dog once he has fully recovered from the trauma. 

'Nothing prepares you for the heartache of taking in an abandoned and abused dogs,' added Mrs Trout, a former IT manager. 

'Cases like this keep me awake at night and in tears - we are not trained to handle the emotional strain of taking in rescue dogs.

'You don’t have to love dogs - just respect them.' 

Kathy Trout said caring for abandoned and abused dogs was a difficult job for which nothing can prepare you
