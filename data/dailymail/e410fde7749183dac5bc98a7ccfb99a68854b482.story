Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Burnley have failed to score in their last four league games against the Reds and in five of the last six matches in all competitions.

Liverpool have lost both Boxing Day fixtures under Brendan Rodgers’ stewardship.

The Reds had lost just two of the 17  Premier League matches on Boxing Day prior to Rodgers’ arrival (W10 D5 L2).

Liverpool won both Premier League games against Burnley 4-0 in the Clarets only season in the Premier League.

The Reds are in their lowest position on Christmas Day since the inaugural Premier League season (1992-93), when they were 10th – the same as they are now.

Burnley's only goal against Liverpool in the last 20 years came through Djimi Traore, who scored a comical back-heel own goal in a 1-0 win for the Clarets during a January 2005 FA Cup tie

Danny Ings (four goals and two assists) has been involved in 50 per cent of Burnley’s goals so far this season in the Premier League.

Only Charlie Austin (65 per cent of QPR’s goals) has been involved in a larger share of his team’s goals than Ings so far this season.

The woodwork at Turf Moor has been struck 10 times this season; more often than any other Premier League ground this season.

Since the beginning of last season Brendan Rodgers’ side have hit the frame of the goal 31 times; more than any other team in the top-flight.

Mario Balotelli has picked up just one card fewer (19 - 16Y 3R) than he has scored goals (20) in his Premier League career.
