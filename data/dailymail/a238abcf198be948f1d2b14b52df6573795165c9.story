Big issue: Darts champion Phil Taylor stormed off stage after being teased about his weight

With 15 world titles under his belt, one would think darts star Phil Taylor had seen and heard it all during his long career at the oche.

But the sport's most famous player stormed off the stage after members of the crowd started teasing him about his weight during a tense semi-final.

Taylor, nicknamed The Power, has been on a strict diet to improve his game and was in no mood to endure the jibes from hecklers.

His early exit stunned fans of the sport, which has long been lampooned for the portly appearance of some of its competitors.

Taylor, 51, who has lost two-and-a-half stones in three months, was playing long-time rival Raymond van Barneveld at the SRT/Simpson & Ward Shetland Masters in Lerwick when we walked off.

He said afterwards that he had been upset by abuse from spectators.

'I want fans to come to the events and to enjoy themselves,' he told the Daily Telegraph, 'and it's fine for them to support a particular player, but it goes too far when the abuse is personal.

'I was upset by some of the comments being aimed in my direction, which was why I left the stage, and I apologise to the majority of fans that I wasn't able to finish the game.'

The walkout disappointed about 700 spectators, who had each paid about £50 to attend the annual event at Lerwick's Clickimin Leisure Centre.

One fan told the Sun: 'He (Taylor) was getting dog’s abuse from fans who obviously wanted Barneveld to beat him. They were playing and Barneveld was winning.

'Somebody shouted something from the crowd and Phil just walked off.

'The abuse he was getting was terrible, some of the people shouting were obviously drunk.'
