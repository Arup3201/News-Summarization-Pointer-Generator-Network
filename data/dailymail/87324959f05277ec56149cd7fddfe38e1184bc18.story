British doubles specialist Ross Hutchins became a Grand Slam semi-finalist for the first time as he and partner Yung-Jan Chan progressed to the last four of the mixed doubles at the US Open on Monday.

Hutchins and Chan, of Chinese Taipei, were leading Marcin Matkowski and Kveta Peschke 6-4, 1-2 when Peschke retired as she struggled on a hot and humid evening in New York.

The pair now face a tough semi-final against top seeds Sania Mirza and Bruno Soares, who knocked out Jamie Murray and Casey Dellacqua in the second round.

Teamwork: Ross Hutchins and Yung-Jan Chan reached the semi-finals of the US Open mixed doubles

Hutchins said: 'It's exciting. I'm really pleased actually to win a few matches.

'She [Chan] was playing great. I enjoy playing with her. We were very relaxed on court.'

It is an impressive run for the first-time pairing, who decided to team up after an initial meeting in the gym at Wimbledon two months ago.

Hutchins said: 'She came up to me at Wimbledon while I was in the gym and just said "Hey, I'm Letitia [her English name]. What's your ranking?"

Talking tactics: Hutchins is finding his form again

'She seemed really nice. We got on really well. The first time we ever hit together was probably about half an hour before the first match.'

The mixed doubles has provided a welcome run of results for 29-year-old Hutchins, who has struggled to rediscover his form after returning to the tour in January following his successful battle against cancer in 2013.

Hutchins and Colin Fleming's first-round exit in the men's doubles at Flushing Meadows was their third in a row at this year's Grand Slams.

The US Open was the last event in which Hutchins could use his protected ranking of No 29, meaning that he will now have to start using his current ranking of No 148 for tournament entry.

With his ranking too low to enter ATP tour events, Hutchins admits that he and Fleming will now have to temporarily part ways.

Hutchins said: 'Together we're not going to be playing the next month or so because we are not going to get in.

'Colin's going to play a couple of tournaments with someone else. For me, I need to get my ranking back up which is going to be from playing Challengers and different events.'
