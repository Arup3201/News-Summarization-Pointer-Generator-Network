Film director Ken Russell left his entire Â£850,000 to his fourth wife - without a penny going to his eight children from three earlier marriages.

Russell who died in his sleep  last November aged 84 was known for provocative films, including the Oscar winning Women in Love and The Devils.

He drew up most of his will in 2009, leaving everything to his wife Elize Tribble, 58, an American born actress who nursed him through ill health in his final years.

The couple married in 2001 after
 Russell posted a lonely hearts 
advert on the internet. Miss Tribble told him his films had changed her
 life.

She made her first ever visit to England
 to meet him and immediately moved in to his 16th century thatched 
cottage in the New Forest.

The couple lost most of 
their possessions when his home burned down in 2006. They later 
moved to a modern detached house in Lymington, Hampshire.

Russell had five
 children Alex, James, Toby, Xavier and Victoria from his first marriage
 to costume designer Shirley Kingdom which lasted from 1956 to 1978. 
Shirley died in 2002.

His 
marriage to American screenwriter Vivian Jolly from 1983 to 1991 
produced two children Molly and Rupert. His youngest child Rex, 18, was 
born during his third marriage to actress Hetty Baines from 1992 to 
1999.

Russell's death was announced by his 
artist son Alex Verney-Elliott, 52, who said that he had died 
peacefully "with a smile on his face" after a series of strokes.

All Russell's possessions were left his wife under the terms of the will. She
 was also left the remainder of his estate after
legal and funeral fees.

Legacies to a spouse are free of 
inheritance tax. The will 
also stated that his estate should be split between daughter Victoria, 49, 
and son Rex, 18, if his wife had died before him.

His widow said after his death that he 
had wanted a Viking funeral, leaving the world in a blazing pagan 
longship. Instead there was a more simple ceremony at Bournemouth 
crematorium.

The colourful director's work included the controversial adaptation of DH
 Lawrence's novel Women in Love in 1969.

The film received five Oscar nominations and won a Best Actress award for Glenda Jackson. It also famously featured Oliver Reed wrestling
 in the nude at the fireside with co-star Alan Bates.

Russell's 1971 film The Devils which also starred Reed along with Vanessa Redgrave was banned in several countries due to its violent scenes.

He was chosen by The Who to direct Pete Townshend's rock opera Tommy. The film featured Reed, Eric Clapton, Jack Nicholson, Tina Turner, Elton John.
