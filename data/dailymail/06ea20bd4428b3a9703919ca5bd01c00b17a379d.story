To most of us, Katie Piper is the brave acid attack victim turned M&S model, dedicated philanthropist and, in recent years, something of a national treasure.

But to fans of Channel 4 show Bodyshockers, she's also a presenting pro who manages to keep a straight face even when confronted with the most bizarre of body modifications and DIY tattoo disasters.

To those watching as Rodrigo Alves, a flight attendant who has spent £125,000 on surgery, attempts to drum up some sympathy for his cosmetic surgery 'addiction', Piper's sympathetic approach can seem bizarre.

Unflappable: Katie Piper manages to keep a straight face even when confronted with the most bizarre of looks

After all, here is a woman whose body was modified, if you can call it that, without her having any say in it, chatting to people about their uniformly self-inflicted woes.

But Piper, 31, who has done more than most to raise awareness about the plight of acid attack victims, says these people are deserving of a fair hearing - even if that isn't apparent at first. 

'We have all done things we regret,' explains the mother-of-one. 'But in most cases we can simply wash out that hair dye or take out those earrings. 

'I actually feel really sorry for people like these because whether their appearance was an accident or intentional, it’s horrible to feel trapped in a body that doesn't reflect who you are.'

This season of Bodyshockers has so far included Lee, a father of five from Grimsby who got a DIY tattoo on his face using printer ink while drunk and Joel Miggler, a German model who had his cheeks pierced and stretched in the name of art.

The latter, says Piper, is one of the few who did make her do a double take. 'He had these holes in his face the size of coke cans,' she exclaims.

Distressing: Father-of-five Lee attempted to remove his tattoos using a cheese grater 

Proud: By contrast, Callum is so proud of his inkings, he's planning to tattoo the rest of his family

'He did it all in the name of art but it was just so impractical for talking and eating and swallowing.'

Equally shocking in Piper's eyes are the people who have been left so traumatised by their youthful mistakes, they've gone to extreme lengths to fix things.

One such person was Lee, who resorted to scrubbing off his tattoos using a cheese grater but was left with scabs all over his face, and a man named Ernesto who took razor blades to his ears.

'He had had ear stretchers as a teenager and had been left with all this gaping flesh,' she explains. 

'He had attempted to do a DIY reversal and cut into his own flesh with razor blades he had found in the bathroom - that really did shock me.'

Perhaps more shocking though, are those people who say they adore their unusual new look - however bizarre and painful the methods used to achieve it.

One is Savannah who won't be dissuaded from her quest to get beach ball sized breasts while a contributor from last year's series is Cherrelle who spent £3,000 on having holes punched in her cheeks in a bid to get dimples like Cheryl Fernandez-Versini's.

Others, such as Callum, a tattoo fan from Scotland, have transformed themselves completely by getting tattooed from head-to-toe - something that Piper says is down to wanting to stand out.

'The alternative and underground scene is becoming a lot more popular  and people are having to find new ways to shock,' she explains.

'People tell me it’s quite addictive - not the actual procedures themselves but the attention that they get and in that sense, I think it is quite an adrenaline rush.'

Not quite so thrilled are those who get inkings done under the influence - something that is becoming increasingly common.

Those to do so include Stefan Owen, 20, from Gloucestershire, who appeared on last year's show with an arm that bore the legend: 'Barry is a T**t' and Holly Aston, also 20 but from Birmingham, who discovered friends had inked a penis on her shoulder during a drunken party.

'People should absolutely not get tattoos while under the influence,' says an animated Piper. 'It is such a bad idea.

New mother: Piper says she would be horrified if baby Belle Elizabeth (pictured) got a tattoo in future

'To make the sort of decision that has such an invasive and permanent result when you are drunk is obviously never going to end well.

'You would never be allowed to have an operation in that state so why tattoos?'

Unsurprisingly, with so many bad examples to choose from, Piper says she would be aghast if her 11-month-old daughter Belle Elizabeth tried to get a tattoo of her own one day.

'If she wanted extreme surgery I would be disappointed and would wonder what I had done wrong,' says a horrified Piper. 'I have always tried to teach her that looks aren’t important.'

But, she continues, 'if she wanted a tattoo, I would try and remember that I don’t own her body and she is free to make her own decisions.

'I bet she gets Bodyshockers tattooed across her forehead just to get me back. That’s always the way - if children are told not to do something they  rebel and do it anyway.'

If the colourful cast of characters who appear weekly on Bodyshockers are any indication, so, it seems, do adults.
