A Columbia University Dental School student only weeks from graduating disappeared this week - and police believe fear she may have taken her own life.

Jiwon Lee, 29, hasn’t been seen since leaving her apartment on Manhattan’s Upper West Side Tuesday night around 8.30 p.m., police said and her family believe foul play is involved.

Investigators allegedly found a suicide note on a desk in Lee's apartment written out to her family.

Dead: The body of Jiwon Lee, 29, was pulled from the Hudson River in New York on Saturday

Jiwon Lee had previously tried to take her own life with pills, an NYPD official told MailOnline.

'She wrote them all a letter that it was not their fault, she gave up on life,' said the cop.

Police are not sure how long ago the note was written, but do see it as an ominous sign.

Lee last spoke with her brother and 
another person, whose phone number has since been disconnected, before 
she went missing, a friend told Gothamist.

The call lasted for half an hour until 
just before the last contact her phone had with a local cell tower, her 
brother Matt Lee told MailOnline.

The number tracks to Sacramento, 
California, and she had spoken with the person previously.

Well respected: Jiwon Lee was recently the president of the American Student Dental Association

'This Is very unusual for her, she’s never disappeared and not let someone know,' said the brother. 'She’s never done anything like this... we don’t think it is anything she did herself that has caused her to be missing.'

The five-foot-two, 120-pound student has black hair and black eyes, she was last seen by her roommate at their West 98th Street apartment.

Police last tracked her cell phone to West 179th Street, near the George Washington Bridge, through pings from cell towers, friend Kimberli Leal told MailOnline.

It last contacted that tower at 9.33 p.m., her brother said, adding that there was no reason he was aware of for her to be in that area.

'We’re hopeful that it has nothing to do with the bridge,' he said.

The worried brother lives on West 175th Street, and loved ones believe she may have been on her way to see him, but he was not expecting her, he lamented.

Police have searched the area with dogs and divers but have come up empty, said Matt Lee. A review of bridge surveillance footage also showed nothing, but the police source said that doesn't mean she didn't access the pedestrian walkway.

Nowhere to be found: Jiwon Lee hasn't been seen or heard from in almost a week

Where she was last seen: Miss Lee went missing after leaving her apartment at 8.30pm on April 1

Investigators and loved ones have spent 
days combing the area for signs of the missing part-time comedian. They 
have also created a Facebook page to aid in the search.

A search of the harbor also has not turned up any trace of the missing woman, he added.

‘We’re hoping for the best,’ said Leal, ’we’re really just hoping for the best.’

A group of friends has gathered every day to post signs in the areas around her apartment, where she went missing and by Columbia University Medical Center, said Leal.

‘We really need to find her,’ she added.

'She’s an amazing individual, very high achieving, very caring about others,' her brother said. 'We just want her to come home.'

Jiwon Lee was, until two weeks ago, the president of the American Student Dental Association, according to Jonathan Shenkin.

‘Jiwon is an exceptionally well respected leader in this nation in the dental community,’ he told MailOnline. ‘People adored her from the moment they met her.’

She had just passed her board exams and was expecting to graduate in May, according to Leal.

The soon-to-be dentist wasn’t outwardly having any personal problems in the days and weeks leading up to her disappearance, Leal said.

‘Everything was fine.’

The well-rounded student also taught math to middle school students in the city through AmeriCorps, according to the Columbia Spectator.

A GoFundMe site has been set up to help raise money to hire a private investigator. Money raised will also be used to provide a reward to anyone who comes forward with information leading to Jiwon Lee.

Anyone with information is urged to contact NYPD Crime Stoppers. All calls are confidential.
