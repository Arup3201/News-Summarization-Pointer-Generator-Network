A national guard aircraft returning to base from a training mission on Thursday night accidentally dropped a practice bomb over the town of Sudlersville, Maryland.

A potential disaster was narrowly avoided when the bomb landed in a carpark rather than closer to a nearby bar called Darlene’s Tavern.

Surveillance video from just after 9 p.m. on Thursday shows stunned patrons looking on as gray smoke billows from the parking lot.

Suspect device: A practice bomb, made to fly like a 500-pund bomb, but weighed much less, accidentally dropped on a Maryland carpark on Thursday

Owner Darlene Hurley said a customer came in from outside saying he thought a car in the parking lot was on fire.

After going outside to find most of the vehicles in the carpark covered in dust and stones and a 3-foot deep hole, she called 911.

Police officers dug in the hole and when they spotted the fins of the device, they called in the fire marshal's bomb squad.

Bomb technicians determined that it was a practice aerial bomb and the device was turned over to the National Guard, the fire marshal's office said.

‘It could have been a whole lot worse. It landed about 100 feet from the building,’ Hurley said noting that there are propane tanks nearby.

‘It could have been really, really bad. Thank God everyone was OK.’

Maryland National Guard spokesman Lt. Col. Charles Kohler confirmed on Friday that an A-10 Warthog jet from the 104th Fighter Squadron in the 175th Wing was returning from a training mission to Warfield Air National Guard Base in Middle River when the inert device was dropped.

He believes an electronic failure may have been to blame and said the device - which wasn’t explosive - was made to fly like a 500-pund bomb, but weighed much less.

‘This is an unfortunate incident and we're very lucky that no one was hurt. Safety is a top priority in all operations,’ Kohler said.
