A cowboy builder charged a couple £49,000 to convert their home so they could start fostering and then turned it into a ‘deathtrap’.

William White left Simon and Rachel Ballamy's house in Devon in such a state after seven months of work that they had to spend another £40,000 on having it fixed and made safe.

Having remortgaged their house to cover the spiralling costs, they can now no longer afford to go ahead with fostering.

The judge at Plymouth Crown Court said the 'cowboy' builder had left electricals in a life-threatening condition had that it was only through luck that disaster had been been averted.

He said that the accountant's ‘meddling’ in a building firm was a ‘grievous mistake and catastrophically wrong’, and that he gave good builders a bad name.

The 51-year-old and his estranged former partner Jayne Thompson, 50, both avoided immediate jail terms yesterday when they were sentenced.

Recorder Sean Levene told White, from Exeter, Devon: 'You did not have a clue what you were doing.'

His work was so ‘shoddy’ that the Ballamys ordered them off site after seven months of chaos. 'Effectively that property was left as a deathtrap,' said Mr Levene.

White and Thompson also admitted claiming VAT even though their Exeter-based company Eaglerock Associates Ltd was not VAT registered - which it should have been.

The court heard they defrauded their clients and pocketed the cash.

The judge said the jury rejected Thompson’s claims at trial that she was ‘naive’ and a ‘stooge’ in White's scheme.

Despite branding the Ballamy’s bungalow in Newton Abbot a death trap, the judge said that ‘no harm was caused to anybody through your own bit of luck’.

Legally aided White and Thompson, who manages a number of properties, face paying sizeable financial compensation to the victims plus £25,000 court costs and their own defence, with the judge saying it should not ‘cost the State a penny’.

White admitted breaching professional diligence with the shoddy state of the electrical work and two counts of fraud relating to £6,500 ‘VAT’ fees. He was jailed for nine months, suspended for 12 months and ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work.

His ex partner was jailed for six months, suspended for 12 months, and told to carry out 120 hours of unpaid work.

The ‘work’ to convert the property began in February 2009 until the 'builders' were ordered off the site in August that year.

'Naive': The judge refused to accept White's ex-partner Jayne Thompson's claim that she was a 'stooge' in his plans

A county court ordered the defendants to pay back £49,000 but their company has gone into liquidation without a penny being paid - so far.

He also banned them from being directors of any company for ten years - even though they are both already banned until 2018.

Devon Trading Standards prosecutor David Sapiecha said the electrical work could have proved fatal to the owners and threatened the building.

He described it as ‘very poor quality work’, with wires were left sticking out of floors and construction work half complete.

One light switch turned on a light in a different part of the house, which the judge said was ‘funny when it happens in films’.

'It was dangerous, it was a death trap,' said the judge.

White’s defence lawyer Ian Dixie said 
his client was 'not responsible for the electrical work’ which he 
accepted was ‘thoroughly incompetent’.

The accountant had charged the Ballamys just £2,000 for it, with Mr Levene commenting: 'If you pay peanuts you get monkeys.'

The judge told the lawyer he was carrying out a ‘conjuring trick to make the £6,500 VAT vanish’ by claiming it was only the taxman who had lost out in the fraud.

After the case the Ballamys, both 37, said they were ‘happy’ with the sentences.

Mobility advisor Mr Ballamy said: 'Our lives have been turned upside down. Our finance plan is ten years from where it was.'

Mrs Ballamy added: 'White knew about the fostering because he said he would reflect it in the £49,000 price.

'We cannot afford to foster now. In effect we had to pay twice to get the house done. And it is not completely finished yet. This has been going on for four years.'

White and Thompson tried to cover their faces as they entered court with a group of associates who said ‘result’ as the judge passed sentence.

But outside White approached two other female victims who told him: 'You took my money, you have no heart, you tell lies.'

He replied: 'Take me to court.'
