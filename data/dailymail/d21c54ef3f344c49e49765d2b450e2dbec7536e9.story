A lottery game that starts next week gives too little to charity, it was claimed last night.

The Health Lottery has been set up as a rival to the National Lottery with cash also going to good causes.

Tickets will cost £1, of which 20.3p will go toward projects that tackle health inequalities.

It will operate as a series of 51 
lotteries, each representing a local authority area. Each will take it 
in turn to be the beneficiary of the draw.

However, the National Lottery donates
40 per cent more – 28p from every £1 ticket. Local raffles typically 
give away more than half their profits.

Richard Desmond, who is worth an 
estimated £950million and owns X-rated TV channels as well as Channel 5 
and several newspapers, is behind the venture.

The lottery’s organisers 
say they will not disclose which good causes will benefit until next 
month but around £50million will go to charity in the first year.

Projects are likely to include 
funding for specialist dementia nurses and counselling for young carers.

Critics accuse Mr Desmond of profiteering on the back of charities and 
undermining more generous lotteries.

Acevo chief executive Sir Stephen Bubb, branded Mr Desmond a 'disgrace', saying: 'He is only giving 20p out of a pound to charity - not 28p as the National Lottery does.

'So if people switch to Desmond from the National Lottery charities will lose out.

'I call on him to raise it to 28p if he actually cares about health charities.'

Tickets for The Health Lottery go on sale this Thursday and it offers a top prize of £100,000 for matching five numbers. There is no cap on how many people can claim this prize. People who match four numbers will win £500, while three numbers will be awarded £50.

The draw will be shown during adverts on ITV and on Channel 5 each Saturday and will be hosted by Eamonn Holmes.

Sir Stephen Bubb: Calls on Richard Desmond to raise amount given to charity to 28%

Mr Desmond has signed up more than 40,000 retailers to sell tickets for his Health Lottery - 12,000 more than the number of shops selling tickets for the National Lottery.

Sir Stephen told Mail Online: 'If he (Mr Desmond) is setting the health lottery up as a direct competitor - and it looks like he is - charities will lose out.

'It will be robbing charity Peter to pay charity Paul.'

He also criticised Mr Desmond for setting up a separate new administrative machine for the new health lottery.

'It's wasting money that could be going to good causes,' he said.

'The Big Lottery Fund already does this effectively and has a strong track record in grant making.

'It also supports charities across the sector, from health to the arts to sports.'

Garth Caswell, of the Hospice Lotteries Association, which runs weekly lotteries to raise money for 115 hospices, warned the venture posed a major threat to local charities.

He added: 'It's potentially diverting huge amounts of money away from local hospice care at a time when charities are already losing revenue as a result of the economic downturn.

The new health lottery will be licensed by the Gambling Commission. Because it is a' society lottery' it will not have to pay 12 per cent lottery duty to the Government, which Camelot must pay.

Under its rules, the health lottery must give at least 20 per cent of the revenue from ticket sales to good causes. The rest can be used for prizes and the operator's expenses.

Health Lottery chief executive Martin Hall, defended the decision to give the minimum amount, saying: 'The National Lottery gives less money in prizes, we give more. So if we give more in prizes there is less to give away.'

He added: 'The Health Lottery game is a fresh new alternative which has one single good cause at its heart - health.

'We will be offering people the opportunity to win a life-changing amount of money while at the same time contributing to tackling real health issues in their own communities.'

Mr Desmond's firm, Northern Shell, owns newspapers including the Daily Express and Daily Star.
