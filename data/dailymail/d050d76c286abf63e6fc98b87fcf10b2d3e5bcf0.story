Ferrell hosted the event, which raises money for Cancer for College, a charity founded by friend Craig Pollard.

However, the host himself didn't last too long when it came to taking on some of the tennis elite as the comedian walked off the court claiming he had an inflamed buttock muscle.

Instead Ferrell, famed for Anchorman among other films, sat on the sidelines making fun of Bieber as he strutted his stuff on the California courts against Bouchard and co.
