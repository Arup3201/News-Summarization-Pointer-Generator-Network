A 28-year-old woman who was killed in a triple stabbing has been described by friends as an 'angel'.

Keisha McKenzie, 28, was stabbed at a flat in Brixton, south London, on Monday and later pronounced dead at the scene.

A 40-year-old man has now been remanded in custody after appearing in court charged with her murder and the attempted murder of two others.

Police were called to the flat in Brixton at 7.10pm, where they found that the dead woman's 17-year-old sister, Saffron Yeboah-Simpson, had also been stabbed in the head and hands.

She remains in a serious but stable condition in hospital.

Half an hour earlier, Joan Wade, 46, was repeatedly stabbed at another flat nearby. She is in a critical condition in hospital.

Police believe a young boy was at each address when the attacks occurred, but that neither was injured.

Wearing a grey T-shirt and white trousers, Desmond Brooks, from Brixton, south London, spoke only to confirm his name, address and date of birth during the two-minute hearing at Camberwell Magistrates' Court.

He was told he will appear at the Old Bailey for a further hearing on Friday.

No details of the case were given. The victims were named in court documents.

Brooks was arrested shortly before 1am on Tuesday as he travelled on a bus in Leigham Court Road, just over a mile from where the women were stabbed.

Police later confirmed that a post-mortem examination at Greenwich Mortuary gave Ms McKenzie's cause of death as multiple stab wounds.

Her next of kin have been informed.

A single bunch of flowers was today left at the scene where Miss McKenzie died.

The note attached read: 'To Keisha, I cannot believe this is true. Rest in perfect peace. Make sure you watch over us esp J.

'God has taken an angel, a mother, a sister, an aunty, a very good friend to a better place. I love you with all my heart and pray to God I see you one day in heaven. Love Natalie D x x x.'

Residents in the council block Ms McKenzie lived in for eight years, said she was 'very friendly and would always say hello.'

One woman said: 'I used to see her taking her son to school in the mornings. She was always very nice and polite.'
