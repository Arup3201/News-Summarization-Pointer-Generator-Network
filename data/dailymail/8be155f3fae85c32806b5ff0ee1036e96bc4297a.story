Another giant rat has been trapped by pest control after terrorising an Irish family in south Dublin, in what is just the latest case of 'monster vermin' in residential areas.

The 24inch monster rodent had been terrorising Grace and Ian Walters’ home in Kingswood shortly after they moved into their new flat.

Pest control were called in but despite luring the large rat into a trap, it was so big it had to be removed by hand.

Big rodent: The giant monster rat was found in a family residence in Kingswood, south Dublin last week

Grace and Ian Walters had just moved 
into their home near Citywest Industrial Park in the Irish capital when 
they heard ‘loud scratching sounds’ in the ceiling

Marcus
 Giusti, of Total Pest Control, said it was one of the biggest rats he 
has ever caught, but agreeing with recent reports from the UK and 
Europe, he says the pests are growing bigger and their numbers are 
swelling too.

‘I think it’s a lot to do with climate and hygiene,’ he told Irish Independent.

‘If
 people leave their household bins overflowing and in disarray, they are
 essentially creating a food source for these animals.’

‘We really weren’t anticipating the rat would be that big. The trap didn’t have any impact on him so we had to stick our head up where the speaker was located and remove it that way,’ he told independent.ie.

Ireland
 is not the only place to see an increase in large rodents, with towns 
in England and the U.S. as well as Sweden reporting several cases of 
‘monster rats’.

On Thursday this week, Max the Jack Russell hit the headlines after catching an over-sized rat during a walk in a park in the Kent town of Royal Tunbridge Wells.

Both scares come just days after pest controllers in Birmingham reported more than 5,000 sightings of large rats, some as big as cats, in the past year.

Last month the 19inch Viking-rat of Solna, Sweden, made news around the globe after it was found in a flat in suburban Stockholm.

Earlier this year, pest control experts warned that rats are mutating and developing an immunity to tradition poisons.

The pesticides wipe out weaker animals, meaning that those that survive are able to withstand increasing amounts of poison.
