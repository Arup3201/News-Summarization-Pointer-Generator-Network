A young New Jersey mother shown in a cell phone video being pummeled by a former co-worker has spoken out for the first time since the vicious attack, saying she was shocked that no one besides her 2-year-old son came to her rescue.

Catherine Ferreira, 27, appeared before reporters in her home in Salem, New Jersey, Friday with a badly swollen face and two black eyes.

Ferreira suffered a broken nose and a mild concussion at the hands of Latia Harris, 25, who was captured on video throwing the petite woman to the ground like a rag doll and repeatedly punching her in the face.

Horryfing aftermath: Catherine Ferreira, 27, suffered a broken nose, two black eyes and a mild concussion, but she said she could have been dead had her assailant struck her in the right spot

Little hero: Ferreira said her sole protector during the beating was her 2-year-old son, Xzavion, who threw himself on Latia Harris

The video of the brutal beating has gone viral and sparked a widespread outrage, since none of the bystanders seen in the footage came to Ferreira’s aid as she was being brutalized by the much larger woman; instead, they looked on with their cell phone cameras trained on the brawl.

Caught: Latia Harris, 25, is in jail and now facing charges of assault and making terroristic threats

'I think it’s messed up no one came to my rescue,' Ferreira told NBC Philadelphia.

The only person to intervene on behalf of the woman was her 2-year-old, Xzavion Ortiz. The toddler is seen in the video repeatedly kicking Harris in the legs and screaming at her to stop hitting his mother. 

‘I became so much closer to my son 
because he didn't care what was going on,’ she said. ‘He wasn't afraid. 
He just wanted to defend his mom.’

Ms Ferreira explained to NJ.com that she used to work at the same Salem McDonald’s as Harris.

Two
 or three weeks ago, she stopped by the eatery to chat with some of her 
former colleagues, and at one point Ferreira made an off-hand remark 
about Latia Harris' alleged romantic relationship with her supervisor.

Idle gossip: Ferreira (left) said her feud with Harris (right) started a couple of weeks ago when she dropped by the McDonald's where she once worked to chat with her friends and mentioned that Harris had a relationship with a manager

Different persona: Harris also goes by the name Alima Zawjatul Abdul Sabur

Family matters: The 25-year-old has two young children (pictured) and a large family in Philadelphia

According to Ferreira, the 25-year-old overheard her comment and became upset. In the weeks that followed, Harris kept calling her and saying that she could get fired over the bit of gossip. 

On Tuesday, Ferreira said she was walking home with her son at around 7pm when Harris ambushed her in a clearing behind the McDonald’s and smacked her.

The 4-foot-9, 10-pound mother tried to reason with Harris and informed her that she did not want to fight, but the woman ignored her pleas, hurling Ferreira' to the ground.

‘I could have been dead right now, had she hit me in the right spot it would have been over, over nothing,’ Ferreira tearfully said. ‘McDonald’s isn’t worth it, a guy isn’t worth it.’

The people who witnessed the attack and did nothing to stop it have been condemned by local police and the media, but Ferreira cautioned against demonizing them, stressing in the interview that they should not be seen as ‘monsters.’

Face-off: Police in New Jersey have obtained this cell phone video showing a female McDonald's worker dressed in a burgundy uniform confronting a young mother in a wooded area in Salem

Pummeled: The attacker, identified as Latia Harris, pulled the 27-year-old woman to the ground in front of her 2-year-old son and proceeded to punch her in the face about 20 times

Speaking of her attacker, who is 
currently being sought by police on assault charges, Ferreira broke down
 in tears, saying she felt sorry for her because the woman has two 
children.

In a statement to ABC Action News Thursday night, Salem City McDonald's owner Jim Burlaga said he was 
extremely disturbed by the incident, and that Harris will not be serving
 his customers going forward. 

As of Friday morning, Ms Harris, who also goes by the name Alima Zawjatul Abdul Sabur, remained at large. Police believe she may have traveled to Philadelphia to stay with family.

Police have obtained a copy of the video depicting the attack before it was removed from Facebook. 

The graphic footage shows the McDonald's employee pounding  Ferreira as a group of people stand around and watch in a wooded area behind the McDonald’s eatery on East Broadway in Salem. 

After the victim is thrown to the ground, the attacker proceeds to punch and kick her at least 20 times.

The woman's toddler tries to intervene on his mother's behalf by kicking her assailant and yelling at her to stop.

‘Mommy!’ the little boy cries out.

At one point, Harris threatens to beat up the 2-year-old.

No mercy: The assailant kicked the mother in the back as she lay on the grass in a fetal position with witnesses standing around her

‘You better get your son before I kick him in the [expletive] face too,’ she screams.

The beating ends with the McDonald's staffer spitting on Ferreira lying bleeding on the ground.

Before
 she walks away, the woman warns the brutalized young mother: 'It's not 
over... you almost made me lose my job… stupid tramp.'  

Police officers were called to the scene just after 7pm after receiving reports of a woman covered in blood.

They found the 27-year-old bleeding 
profusely from her face and acting disoriented and confused. She was 
taken to The Memorial Hospital of Salem County to be treated for injuries to her face. 

Salem Police Chief John Pelura III said in a statement to 
MailOnline Thursday that criminal complaints have been signed against 
Harris for aggravated assault and two counts of terroristic threats, but
 she could face additional charges after her arrest.

Bail for Harris has been set at $35,000. One of the complaints stated that Harris threatened to shoot the 27-year-old mother.

According to the police chief, Harris has not returned to work since the Tuesday assault.

Ominous warning: The 25-year-old allegedly threatened to shoot the victim as payback for nearly getting her fired from McDonald's before she spat on her and walked away

Her last known address is currently vacant and police are working to identify family members and potential locations of Harris’ whereabouts.

'Police in this county deal with this type of violence everyday. Yet, this video is physically sickening to watch,' Pelura stated.

'There is a moral and social breakdown in the fabric of our society which is clearly evident when a woman gets pummeled in broad daylight in front of her child while a dozen people pull out their phones to record the incident instead of calling for help.'

He added: 'There is so little regard for human life - by the actor and the bystanders.'
