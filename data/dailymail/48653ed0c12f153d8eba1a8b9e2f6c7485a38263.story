An engineer refused to install an electricity meter at a couple's home - after telling them he was not trained to climb step ladders.

The worker, from Utility Warehouse, said he was not allowed to use ladders while he was carrying out work at John Stearn's house in Saltburn, Teeside.

Instead, the engineer downed tools and left saying specialist colleagues would have to finish the job.

An engineer told John Stearn, pictured with his wife Linda, that he could not install an electricity meter as he was not trained to climb a step ladder

The company says their employee was unable to carry out the work for 'health and safety reasons'.

Mr Stearn added: 'You don't need a training course to be able to use a pair of ladders.

'You have to laugh at what seems another silly health and safety rule.'

Utility Warehouse said the engineer did not carry out the work for 'health and safety reasons' while he was at the home of John Stearn and his wife Linda, pictured

He had asked his supplier to change both his gas and electricity meters to a pre-payment scheme.

The gas meter was changed without any delay because it was at ground level but the electricity meter was placed on the wall above head height.

With the pair facing financial difficulties, he had hoped the work could have been done quickly to help manage his bills.

'We agreed
 to have pre-payment meters installed thinking it would be a simple 
thing to do, but we had this delay over the ladders,' he added.

Mr Stearn said that he had been one of the company's customers for 'a number of years'.

Jon Goddard, head of distributor 
marketing at the Utility Warehouse, admitted there had been a health and
 safety issue over the job at Mr Stearn's home.

He said: 'We were able to install a gas pre-payment meter, but the installation of the electricity pre-payment meter has been delayed because the engineer we sent to do this work was unable to climb a ladder to exchange the meter due to health and safety reasons.

The highly specialised work was later completed after being referred to a specialist metering team at the company.
