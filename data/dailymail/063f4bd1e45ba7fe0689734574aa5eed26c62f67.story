Dutch Police arrested two men accused of selling ecstasy on Wednesday in the city of Zetten. The men were accused of selling the drug on the popular and controversial website Silk Road.

The 24-year-old and 29-year-old were caught, 'red-handed during the manufacturing of ecstasy in a container behind their home in Zetten. The suspects were arrested with a thick layer of MDMA powder in their hair,' reports The Daily Dot. 

The men's Blackberry phones were wiretapped for about a month prior to their arrest.

Dutch police seized thousands of dollars worth of powdered MDMA and of ecstasy similar to the ecstasy pictured here

Police found trays of MDMA powder, used stamps, cutting tools, and a tablet machine.

When going to their homes in the city of Arnhem they found ecstasy and MDMA worth 26,000 euros in one's home, and drugs worth 80,000 euros in the other home.

The vendors went by the name XTC Express and they were extremely popular among Silk Road users. The 300mg pills were very potent and got great reviews from customers.

XTC Express shipped ectsacy pills with skulls on them from Germany for 158 bitcoins.

A bitcoin is a form of peer to peer online payment system that avoids banks or central authority. Bitcoins make transactions almost impossible to track--almost. 

Illicit drug website Silk Road was seized, its founder arrested, and vendors from around the globe are being investigated and taken into custody

One Australian Silk Road user reached out to the forums to see if anyone knew what happened to an order he'd placed from vendor that was due to arrive in September.

It is unknown as to whether the delivery was lost or intercepted by law enforcement officials.

Silk Road's founder Ross William Ulbricht, 29, was arrested on Oct. 1 at a small branch library in San Francisco as he chatted online with a cooperating witness, according to authorities and court papers.

The entrepreneur's charges go way beyond facilitating drug trafficking like the transactions commissioned from XTC Express.

Ulbricht is charged in Baltimore federal court with soliciting the murder of a former worker who went under the name 'FriendlyChemist' who was arrested on drug charges. The indictment alleges Ulbricht feared the former worker would turn on him and blackmail him.

Ulbricht using his screen name 'Dread Pirate Roberts' is said to have hired a hit man to kill the father of three from British Columbia for 500,000.

An undercover agent posing as a drug dealer got Ulbricht to send him 27,000 worth of cocaine and after fabricating a story that one of his employees was arrested and needed to be 'silenced' he agreed to have the man killed for 80,000 and asked for a form of evidence like a photograph of the man's face.

Ross William Ulbricht's face is now unmistakeable. The identity of the dutch ecstasy vendors is not yet disclosed.
