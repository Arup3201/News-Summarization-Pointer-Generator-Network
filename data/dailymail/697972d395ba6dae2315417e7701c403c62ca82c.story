Barcelona president Marc Bartomeu is plotting a  bid for Juventus star Paul Pogba worth a total of £144million, according to reports in Spain.

Catalan-based publication Sport say that the move will be part of Bartomeu's chief aim as he attempts to remain in power with the club's presidential elections taking place at the end of the season.

The newspaper also adds that Bartomeu wants to speak to the France international  to arrange a preliminary deal to secure his services with Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea and eternal rivals Real Madrid also interested in the 21-year-old midfielder.

Elsewhere in Spain, Madrid-based AS focuses on the La Liga title race.

League leaders Real travel to Athletic Bilbao on Saturday evening in what could be a potential banana skin for Carlo Ancelotti's men.

The 55-year-old has come under pressure recently following Real's dip in form but the Italian has hit back at his critics for his managerial style.

'With this lenient approach I've won three Champions Leagues,' he was quoted as saying on Friday with his trophy-laden CV proving that he knows how to get results.

Over in Italy, Inter Milan midfielder Freddie Guarin has praised the impact that manager Roberto Mancini has made at the club since arriving midway through the campaign.

The Serie A giants were struggling prior to his arrival, but have slowly improved under the Italian.

And Guarin believes Mancini has changed the club's mentality already and helped him improve as a player, adding that the good times will come back to the San Siro outfit.

The feel-good feeling at Inter appears to be well spread among the squad as Guarin's team-mate Xherdan Shaqiri believes qualification for a Champions League spot is not out of the question too.

Inter are currently 10 points behind third-place Napoli with 13 games remaining but the January window signing feels Rafael Benitez's men can be caught in an interview with La Gazzetta dello Sport.
