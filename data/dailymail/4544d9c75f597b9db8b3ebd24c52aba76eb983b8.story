If Argentina's players really did rise as 
one against their coach during the half-time interval of their opening 
group encounter, one can only imagine how uncomfortable a scene it was 
in their dressing room after 45 minutes here. 

Held
 by a determined, if rather negative, Iran, you have to wonder who got 
it in the neck this time. Was it Lionel Messi for leading the calls for Alejandro Sabella to dump his 5-3-2 formation and switch to 4-3-3? 

Or have the mutterings of dissent escalated into an all-out mutiny against the man in charge?

In the end Messi came to their rescue, breaking the deadlock of a bruising encounter with a quite brilliant 90th minute goal. 

But what a struggle a proved to get there, the evidence here 
suggesting that all is not well inside camp Argentina if Messi's public 
criticism of Sabella's tactics provides an accurate measure of the 
atmosphere.

They were disjointed and defensively disorganised, at times a shadow of the team we expected to see take this South American World Cup by storm.

Sunday is the anniversary of Diego Maradona's one-man demolition of England in Mexico but the great man, here among the supporters yesterday, would not have been left convinced that another World Cup can be won on this evidence.

Indeed, had it not been Had it not been for some outstanding goalkeeping by Sergio Romero this could have been a repeat of England-USA 1950, such were the opportunities Iran created.

They were also incredibly defensive, but under the instruction of Carlos
 Quieroz they were a team simply conscious of their weaknesses and 
playing to their strengths. And they were fit too, Quieroz's success in 
persuading Iran to end their domestic season in April clearly proving a 
benefit.

They might fallen to Messi's genius in the end but they deserve respect for making this the contest it was  at a jumping Estadio Mineirao. At times they were nothing short of heroic, even if they weren't always terribly easy on the eye.

And while there might have been times when they appeared more interested in acquiring Messi's shirt –  the
 captain had a crack before kick-off and four more players followed the 
Barcelona superstar off the field at half-time – they also displayed 
genuine ambition to try and progress beyond this group.

For the 
tiny pocket of Iran fans - many of them here armed only with cash 
because international sanctions mean they can't access their bank 
accounts overseas – there was cause for excitement beyond the simple 
fact that their team was playing Messi and his international colleagues.
 There was a chance on goal for the side that battled to a goalless draw
 in their opening game against Nigeria, Jalal Hosseini meeting a 
free-kick with a header that flew wide.

Joy and pain: Messi finally found a way through the red Iran wall in epic encounter

But it did not take long
 for Argentina to seize control of this game, with Javier Mascherano – 
winning his 100th cap – and Fernando Gago very much in command in 
midfield.

The fact that Iran did not concede sooner than they 
did owed much to the heroics of their goalkeeper, Alireza Haghighi 
denying Higuain and Aguero with two marvellous saves. 

But they 
were under so much pressure, their defence stretched in particular by 
the direct running of of the excellent Angel Di Maria.

Messi, 
dropping deeper and deeper to get the ball, went close with a free-kick,
 while Ezequiel Garay really should have struck with the delivery 
Argentina's number 10 then planted on his head. As it was his effort 
drifted hopelessly over the crossbar.

It was becoming rather 
frustrating for Argentina, and more than a little alarming when Hosseini
 threatened with another header. But it was as a defensive unit that 
Iran were impressing, even if such negative tactics must have gone 
against the instincts of a coach who used to stand alongside Sir Alex 
Ferguson every week.

The sight of Aguero throwing a corner flag 
to the ground at the sound of the half-time whistle summed up the mood 
of these Argentina players. They had had 78 per cent of the ball in that
 opening 45 minutes – and completed 265 passes to Iran's 63 - but no 
real joy, Iran proving that talk of a 10-0 formation was not quite the 
joke they claimed it to be.

That said, a rare counter attack 
early in the second half almost resulted in what would have been an 
astonishing goal for Iran. A headline writer's nightmare too. After a 
marvellous burst down the right flank Masoud Shojaei delivered a 
similarly impressive cross, only for Sergio Romero to produce an 
excellent save to stop Reza Ghoochannejhad's close-range header. 

Messi
 would threaten from 20 yards in response but Iran would hit back with 
another couter-attack that demanded yet another save from Romero, this 
time to tip a goal-bound header from Ashkan Dejagah over his crossbar.

Ghoochannejad would go close again, bursting clear only to see Romero deny him again. 

So
 it was left to Messi to finally produce the goal a game this 
enthralling deserved; a classic Messi goal, driven low and at an angle 
from just outside the penalty area with that wonderful left foot.
