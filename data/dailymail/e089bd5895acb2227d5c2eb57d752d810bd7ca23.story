The wife of a young lawyer found stabbed to death in a hotel just five blocks from the White House has made an emotional appeal for anyone with information about her husband’s death to come forward.

The body of 30-year-old David Messerschmitt was discovered at The Donovan on February 10 - 24 hours after his wife, Kim Vuong, reported him missing.

On Wednesday, six weeks after her husband’s brutal murder, Vuong spoke to the media outside the Metropolitan Police Department’s headquarters in Washington D.C.

Kim Vuong made an emotional plea for anyone with information about husband David Messerschmitt's death at The Donovan hotel in Washington D.C. on February 10 to come forward on Wednesday

David Messerschmitt, pictured with his wife Kim Vuong, was found stabbed to death inside a boutique hotel in Washington, D.C. six weeks ago. Police are still unclear of the motive

Vuong asked the public for help in solving the mystery surrounding her husband's death.

'The world has lost a good person. David's family: a son and brother, and I have lost everything: my husband and my best friend. In one day, I lost the most important person in my life and the man I loved so much. And I have no answers,' she said. 

Messerschmitt, a 30-year-old D.C. attorney, was found partially clothed and stabbed in the back at the upscale boutique hotel.

Vuong told police she last saw her husband on February 8 and received a text from Messerschmitt around 7:30 p.m. the following day that said he would behome soon.

Messerschmitt never made it home and Vuong reported him missing on February 9. Messerschmitt's body was discovered the morning of February 10, reports ABC7.

Also at Wednesday’s press conference police confirmed that a person of interest captured in previously released surveillance video was a woman.

She can be seen wearing a dark, hooded jacket while walking through the lobby and a stairwell.

Police have asked for help identifying the person and have offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction.

Authorities have released images from surveillance footage showing a 'person of interest' at the hotel, who they have now confirmed is a woman

Before taking the stairs, the unidentified person waited impatiently for an elevator at the hotel around 7.45pm

Detective Paris White told Daily Mail Online last month that theft was not considered a motive in the crime because all of the victim's valuables, including his wallet, had been left at the scene.

The couple, who married in 2012, lived together in an apartment just three miles from the hotel.

Vuong was not aware her husband was at The Donovan when he sent the text message and she couldn't provide other details of his plans for that day, Detective White said.

The DC Metropolitan detective said that the investigation was 'looking at everything' surrounding Messerschmitt's murder, including his work as a lawyer.

His laptop was seized and investigators had trawled his social media accounts for clues.

The lawyer was found dead at The Donovan, pictured, five blocks from the White House and around three miles from the apartment he shared with his wife. It was not yet clear why he was even at the hotel

Messerschmitt, whose family lives in Cincinnati, graduated from Ohio State University in 2006 and from the Boston University Law School in 2009.

After leaving college, he interned with Susan Dlott, a judge for the U.S. District Court Southern District of Ohio in Cincinnati. 

In April 2014, he joined DLA Piper in Washington, D.C., where he worked as an associate.

His biography for the firm described him as an intellectual-property attorney who negotiated commercial and technology agreements. 

Anyone with information about the crime is asked to contact the Washington, D.C. Police Department on 202-727-9099.
