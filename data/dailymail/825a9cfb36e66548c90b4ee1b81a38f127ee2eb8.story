For fans of the popular online game World of Warcraft, it's a dream come true - the chance to experience the digital fantasy world of monsters, magic and jewelled-bikini warrior women 'in the flesh'... thanks to a theme park in China.

But don't expect to see much Warcraft branding at the World Joyland amusement site because it is totally unlicensed.

In a blatant copyright violation of the Blizzard Entertainment game, authorities in Changzhou in the south of the country allowed the park - cunningly called Terrain of Magic (see what they did there?) - to be built at a cost of £20milllion.

And bearing in mind the owners didn't 
purchase the rights to use the characters, giant statues of characters 
from WoW - horned demons, wolves and dragons - greet you at every 
turn.

Look familiar? One of the sights that greets visitors to Terrain of Magic, an unofficial theme park inspired by the World of Warcraft video game series

It's got monsters, it's got a flume... could this be the cheerily titled Splash Of Monster Blood log ride?

One of the grisly messages on display in the theme park, which is spread over 600,000sq m

Set over 600,000sq metres, it is filled with cheerful rides such as Splash Of Monster Blood (actually a log flume, with added orcs) which states: 'Tourists over 60 are not permitted'.

There's also Sky Scraper, a big blue rollercoaster and one of the star attractions.

Unfortunately, the sign by it is misspelled Sky Scrapper.

Some attractions at what the Chinese are calling the 'world's first video-game themed park' even have a 'Happiness Index', 'Splendour Index' and 'Thrill Index' to help punters decide which one to choose.

Don't miss this 'beast-bloody journey!' as long as you're not drunk or over 60

Known as an 'MMORPG' - massively multi-player online role-playing game - WoW has captured the imagination of players by drawing them into a virtual universe of battles and quests

The first game in the World of Warcraft series was launched in 1994.

It is the world's most popular multiplayer online role-playing game with more than 12million monthly subscribers at its peak.

Known as an  'MMORPG' - massively multi-player online role-playing game - WoW has captured the imagination of players by drawing them into a virtual universe of battles and quests. 

Many players sit alone in their rooms for hours, immersed in the lives of their fantasy character creations - or Avatars.

According to a promotional video, China wants World Joyland to compete with the likes of Universal Studios and Disney.

Not surprisingly, other sections of the park bear an uncanny resemblance to Universal's Islands of Adventure.

Meanwhile in the gift store, you can buy fake swords... along with Minnie Mouse hair bows.

Signs in the park are also written in English, in a style that will appeal to gamers.

One of the first attractions bears the legend: 'With thousand years of unstopped war, this place is forbidden to losers and cowards.

'We are looking forward to a hero to bring back peace with his sword!'

Splendor Index: Five stars.

Francesca O_O told eurogamer.net: 'A lot of the rides used 4-D and special effects, which I hadn’t experienced much of before.

'There was a good rollercoaster with loops, where you are lying horizontally, face forward, like you are flying.

'That was my favourite ride. The water log ride (‘Splash Of Monster Blood’) was pretty good too.'

She added: 'We didn't have time to see everything but the rides we did go on were great.'

Francesca also commented on a massive staircase which ominously leads to a stone castle.

What possible horrors could await thrillseekers at the top? Just a cafe.

'400 steps to a castle with a cafe would have been awesome if it there was a ride at the top,' she said.

And continuing the cheeky theme, part of the park also pays tribute to Blizzard's other smash hit, Starcraft. Only here, it's called Universe of Spaceship.

Joyland is open from 9am to 10pm and entry costs £20.

Mail Online contacted Blizzard, which has declined to comment.
