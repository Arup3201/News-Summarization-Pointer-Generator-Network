Children In Need always pulls in a great charitable celebrity crowd and this year the fash pack have decided to show their support in true designer style.

A host of high-end designers from Alexander McQueen and Prada to Victoria Beckham and Louis Vuitton have contributed to the charity by each designing an adorable and oh-so-chic Pudsey bear.

The 2012 Designer Pudsey Collection, which was the brainchild of Love magazine editor Katie Grand, also features stylish creations from Balenciaga, Burberry, Versace, Paul Smith and Gucci.

The adorable bears will be auctioned at Christie's auction house on November 15 with every single penny going towards the worthwhile cause.

The iconic yellow and red Pudsey has been recreated in an array of different fabrics from suede to Swarovski crystals.

From Gucci’s equestrian Pudsey, to Burberry’s English Gentleman’s Pudsey each bear is completely unique, reflects the designer's trademark style and gives fans an insight into trends for 2013.

Anya Hindmarch, Paul Smith and 
Selfridges have also created 10 inch limited edition Designer Pudsey’s, 
which will be sold exclusively in Selfridges from 24 October 2012.

 was honoured to curate this fantastic collection, and have had such fun
 working with the designers on all of their amazing designs, BBC 
Children in Need is an incredibly worthwhile cause, and one which myself
 and all of the designers involved in the collection are privileged to 
support' said Katie Grand.
