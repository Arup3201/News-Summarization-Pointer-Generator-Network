Rights: Sudanese Amira Osman Hamed faces a possible whipping if she is found guilty in court after refusing to cover her hair

A Sudanese woman who is prepared to be flogged to defend the right to leave her hair uncovered in defiance of a 'Taliban-like' law has appeared in court. 

Amira Osman Hamed faces a possible whipping if convicted.

Under Sudanese law her hair - and that of all women - is supposed to be covered with a 'hijab' but Hamed, 35, refuses to wear one.

Her case has drawn support from civil rights activists and is the latest to highlight Sudan's series of laws governing morality which took effect after the 1989 Islamist-backed coup by President Omar al-Bashir.

Her
lawyer Moezz Hadhra told AFP said: 'The defence asked the court that 
the charges against this woman be withdrawn, and the court adjourned the hearing until October 4 while it considers the request.'

In an interview earlier this month, she said: 'They want us to be like Taliban women.'

She is charged under Article 152 which prohibits 'indecent' clothing.

Hamed said she was visiting a government office in Jebel Aulia, just outside Khartoum, on August 27, when a policeman aggressively told her to cover her head.

Hamed, a divorced computer engineer who runs her own company, said: 'This public order law changed Sudanese women from victims to criminals. 

'This law is targeting the dignity of Sudanese people.'

Defiant: Hamed says she is prepared to be flogged to defend the right to leave her hair uncovered

In 2009, the case of journalist Lubna Ahmed al-Hussein led to a global outcry and highlighted women's rights in Sudan.

Hussein was fined for wearing trousers in public but she refused to pay.

She spent one day behind bars before the Sudanese Journalists' Union paid the fine on her behalf.

Ten other women rounded up with her in a restaurant were each given 10 lashes.
