Government plans for another tolled motorway could backfire, the AA warned today.

George Osborne is believed to be ready to announce a new paid-for 14-mile stretch along the M4 near Newport in South Wales.

However, the AA has criticised the plans saying it would deter people from using it because of the high costs.

The only other toll-motorway in the UK is a 27-mile stretch of the M6 near Birmingham which costs £5.50 for cars and £11 for lorries.

AA president Edmund King said that M4 improvements were welcome but introducing tolls could deter motorists.

He said: 'We have seen with the M6 Toll that drivers can be turned off by the imposition of charges.

'There is already a toll to get into 
Wales on the Severn Crossing but no toll to get out. There is no doubt 
that the M4 around Newport needs improving. At the moment if there is a 
bad accident and the road is closed there is no real alternative for 
drivers.

George Osborne announced £3billion extra a year in infrastructure spending in last month's Budget

'But if the road is tolled it reduces 
its economic effectiveness as a lot of people will be put off using it 
and will simply avoid it.'

Funding for the construction of the 
14-mile M4 relief road, intended to tackle congestion around Newport, 
will be guaranteed by the Treasury. The Welsh government will repay the 
loan by charging drivers to use it.

The Chancellor announced an extra 
£3billion a year in infrastructure spending in last month's Budget. A 
government source told the Times: 'This kind of big investment project 
shows that we're serious about spending on infrastructure and helping 
the whole country.'

The plans for a relief road between 
junctions 23 and 29 of the M4 were first proposed in 2004 and it was due
to open this year, but the scheme was scrapped in 2009 after its cost 
rose to £1billion from its original £350million.

Financial Times journalist Mickey 
Clarke told BBC Radio Wales today: 'It's worth pointing out though that 
the M6 Toll in the Midlands hasn't ever made any money. People won't pay
it. That's the trouble.'

The plans for the road were 
criticised in 2007 by the Gwent Wildlife Trust, which was concerned 
about potential damage to the wetlands which are home to rare plants, 
otters and birds.

Other schemes Mr Osborne is looking at include improvements to the A303 - the road that passes Stonehenge in Wiltshire.

Other projects may include making all the section of the A1 north of Newcastle dual carriageway and improvements to the A47 in Norfolk.

Mr King said: 'Bits of the A1 north of Newcastle are dual carriageway and bits are single carriageway. It certainly needs dualling although the Highways Agency has pointed out that traffic flows are far less heavy than those south of Newcastle.

'The A47 in Norfolk is an accident black spot so improvements there would be welcome.'
