ITV's Daybreak could be renamed Good Morning UK in a bid to make the show more 'newsy' and boost lackluster viewing figures, it has been reported today.

Channel bosses plan to revamp the show, watched by one million every morning compared to rival BBC Breakfast’s 1.5million, to make it more news focused.

The set and the name will also be changed, according to show insiders.

The latest plans comes just 12 months after 
presenters Lorraine Kelly and Aled Jones were brought in to boost the struggling show.

It also follows reports that Mr Jones faced the axe following disappointing viewing figures, and could be replaced by Sky News’ Eamonn Holmes on a £750,000 salary.

Staff were called into a meeting last week about the future of the programme, according to the Sunday People.

An ITV spokesperson said: 'Our new Director of Daytime Helen Warner is looking at the whole of the Daytime schedule and Daybreak is part of this.

Axed? Reports in August suggested that Walking In The Air singer Aled Jones, pictured, could face the axe following unimpressive viewing figures

'Aled and Lorraine are fantastic presenters and remain a key part of plans moving forward.'

The new director has been conducting a review of the channel over the last month and allegedly told the meeting - which was attended by all the top presenters - about her plan to shake-up the show.

She indicated she wanted presenters to sit on more formal chairs and the current bright, colourful set will be given a complete makeover.

The possibility of changing the name of the show was also discussed - although no concrete date was set.

The name Good Morning UK, regarded as the most likely replacement insiders, is expected to come within the next year.

One insider told The People that bosses are desperate for the show to be a success and regain the viewing figures of GMTV.

They said: 'Every detail of the show is being looked at and they are willing to try anything to make the show more attractive to the viewer.'

GMTV started broadcasting in 1993 and was presented by Eamonn Holmes and Anne Davies.

Some of the country's best loved presenters - including Fiona Phillips and Anthea Turner - presented the show over its 17-year run.

After losing some of its best presenters and a slump in viewing figures, ITV announced a major overhaul, with GMTV renamed Daybreak.

Daybreak debuted in September 2010 with 
presenters Christine Bleakley and Adrian Chiles. The duo left the BBC’s 
The One Show for the morning slot for a sizable salary increase.

Daybreak's predecessor, GMTV, ran from 1993 until 2010.

Some of the country's best loved presenters sat on the GMTV sofa, including Fiona Phillips and Anthea Turner.

Daybreak debuted in September 2010 with presenters Christine Bleakley and Adrian Chiles, who left the BBC's One Show for the morning slot.

They were removed in 2011 due to poor ratings, with Kate Garraway and Dan Lobb taking over the sofa.

In September 2012, Lorraine Kelly and Aled Jones were introduced with viewing figures increasing from 500,000 to around one million.

However, ratings soon slumped, leaving rival BBC Breakfast to double its viewers.

Eventually, Chiles and Bleakley were removed from the show in November 2011 - with Kate Garraway and Dan Lobb taking over.

Within the year, Lorraine Kelly - who also presents her self-titled morning show - and former Walking In The Air singer Aled Jones took over.

It was hope that the move — instigated by former BBC Breakfast chief David Kermode — would boost viewing figures from 500,000 to more than a million.

Figures have consistently peaked around the one million mark since the pair took over - 500,000 short of their BBC rivals.

The new name will inevitably call comparisons to Good Morning Britain, which was broadcaster TV-AM’s flagship programme in the 1980s. It was famously presented by Anne Diamond.
