Within a week they will be bitter enemies again.

But David Cameron tried to bring some cheer to final Coalition Cabinet meeting today by giving all of his ministers a free bottle of beer.

The unique brew called 'Co-ale-ition' combines oak flavours to represent the Conservative party and 'zesty lemons' in tribute to the Lib Dems. Nick Clegg provided crisps form Yorkshire.

The bizarre gift greeted the 33 ministers who attend Cabinet each week, along with numerous aides, advisers, officials and spin doctors.

The Co-ale-ition beer was produced by Wychwood Brewery, based in Mr Cameron's Witney constituency.

The gift was made the morning after the night before, as the Tories nurse the political hangover of Mr Cameron's surprise announcement that he would not seek a third term in Number 10.

Senior ministers including Defence Secretary Michael Fallon hit the airwaves this morning to defend the decision as 'sensible' before arriving in Downing Street for the Cabinet meeting.

Home Secretary Theresa May was named by David Cameron as a possible successor. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, who has also been tipped as a leadership challenger, left Number 10 with his bottle of beer

Sitting around the coffin-shaped Cabinet table were some of those Mr Cameron endorsed as possible successors, and several who also covet the top job.

In an interview with the BBC, Mr Cameron said: 'There definitely comes a time where a fresh pair of eyes and fresh leadership would be good, and the Conservative Party has got some great people coming up: the Theresa Mays, and the George Osbornes, and the Boris Johnsons.'

Mrs May was seen arriving in Downing Street this morning. But also in attendance with several Tory ministers who have been tipped as future leaders, including Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, Culture Secretary Sajid Javid and Environment Secretary Liz Truss.

Nick Clegg gave each member of the Cabinet a pot of crisps from his constituency

Wychwood Brewery of Witney created a special Co-ale-ition Beer, bearing a label showing Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg waving in front of the famous Number 10 door above the slogan 'Indispensable political ale'.

Wychwood's Chris Keating said: 'We're delighted the Prime Minister has chosen to support a local business from his constituency to reflect on the last five years and commemorate the occasion with a specially crafted beer for his colleagues.' 

Mr Clegg gave his colleagues a tub of Henderson's Spicy Yorkshire Sauce crisps, branded Coalition Crunch for the occasion.

Mr Clegg said: 'I'm tremendously proud to represent a city that has given the world so many fantastic things over the years. Henderson's Relish is just one of the world famous products to have come out of Sheffield.

'At the end of the five years of this Coalition Government, I could not think of any better gift to give my fellow Cabinet members than a tub of the Spicy Yorkshire Sauce flavoured snacks made by Yorkshire Crisps.

'The Coalition Government has cut taxes for 200,000 people in Sheffield; put £62 million into our schools to help the most disadvantaged children and found £1.2 billion to bring every road in the city up to standard.

'I hope that this gift from the city is a nice reminder of what this Coalition Government has delivered for the North generally and Sheffield specifically.'
