Formula One driver Giedo van der Garde's fight for a race seat for the 2015 season should move a step nearer to a conclusion on Wednesday.

Van der Garde, who was axed as test driver by Sauber at the end of last season, claims he was promised a full-time race seat for the forthcoming campaign that begins in Australia this weekend.

Sauber eventually hired Sweden's Marcus Ericsson and Brazilian Felipe Nasr, but Van der Garde has already seen an arbitration panel in Switzerland rule in his favour and is now looking for that decision to be enforced ahead of the season-opener.

The Supreme Court in Victoria, Australia, announced on Monday via its official Twitter account that a judgement in Van der Garde's case would be reserved until 10am Wednesday local time (11pm Tuesday night UK time).

The Swiss tribunal recently ordered Sauber 'to refrain from taking action' that would deny Van der Garde one of the two race seats, but Sauber are determined to fight their corner.

Team principal Monisha Kaltenborn, a former lawyer, said on Friday: 'As this matter is currently before the courts it would be inappropriate for me to comment on specific details.

'However, we will take all necessary steps to protect our company, this team and its interests.

'Last year was a challenging time for us, but going into the 2015 season we have been focused on putting steps in place to ensure we are delivering the best outcomes for F1's fans.'
