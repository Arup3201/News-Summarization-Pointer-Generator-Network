Bulgaria is closing its investigation into one of the most notorious Cold War assassinations - the killing of exiled dissident Georgy Markov with the poisoned tip of an umbrella on London's Waterloo Bridge.

Markov, a writer, journalist and opponent of Bulgaria's then communist regime, died on September 11, 1978 after a stranger shot a poisoned pellet into his leg.

Prosecutors have failed to identify, arrest or charge anybody for the crime, known as the 'Bulgarian umbrella', and so they announced today that the case would now be closed.

Unsolved murder: For 35 years mystery has surrounded the whereabouts of Georgy Markov's killer, and now Bulgaria is closing the case on the assassination of the former BBC journalist

Bulgarian defector Markov, a broadcaster for the BBC overseas Service, was murdered on Sept 11, 1978

'The probe will be abandoned as of tomorrow, when the absolute statute of limitations of 35 years will expire,' the prosecutors' office spokeswoman Rumiana Arnaudova said.

'To overcome the statute of limitations, we need to have a suspect for the crime arrested, charged or put on a search list. As of the moment, we have not established the perpetrator and neither of the above actions are undertaken,' Arnaudova said.

British police have their own investigation of the affair.

According to accounts of the incident, Markov, who defected to the West in 1969, was waiting for a bus when he felt a sharp sting in his thigh.

A stranger fumbled behind him with an umbrella he had dropped and mumbled 'sorry' in a foreign accent before walking away, hailing a cab and disappearing.

After the umbrella attack, Markov
returned to his office, but quickly fell ill and was taken to hospital 
that night with a high fever.

He died three days later of what is believed to be ricin poisoning, for which there is no antidote.

Writer and dissident Markov had reportedly enraged the
Communist regime with broadcasts on the BBC's Bulgarian Service which 
mocked dictator Todor Zhivkov.

Five years ago, the Bulgarian daily Dnevnik published an investigation into communist-era secret police files which identified Markov's suspected assassin as an agent code-named 'Piccadilly' .

The files show how the agent had 'special training' from Bulgaria's secret police and received two medals, several free holidays and $30,000 after Markov's death, Dnevnik said, adding that Markov's case was discussed with the KGB in Moscow.

In 2008, Bulgarian prosecutors extended the investigation by five years, hoping that access to communist era secret police files would help solve the case.

And earlier this year, prime suspect Francesco Gullino, 66, who was known by his Communist handlers as 'Agent Piccadilly', was tracked down by a Bulgarian film-maker and interviewed.

He lives in a rundown flat in Wels, a small Austrian town where he works as an antiques dealer.

He
was named in Bulgarian files as their only agent in London when the 
regime's secret services –  backed by the KGB –  had Markov 
'liquidated'.

Gullino 
left Britain the day after the attack and flew to Rome, where it is 
alleged he stood in a particular spot in St Peter's Square in order to 
send a signal to his Bulgarian handler.

In March, in an interview with director Klaus Dexel,= for his documentary 'Silenced: The Writer Georgi Markov and The Umbrella Murder,' Gullino admitted 
he was 'probably' in  London at the time of Markov's murder – although 
he denies involvement in the plot.

He
also refused to answer whether he was a spy – despite the huge evidence
in Bulgarian security archives – simply commenting that there were 
'thousands of Google searches' saying that he was one. Markov had lived 
in Clapham, South London since fleeing Bulgaria in 1969.

Francesco Gullino known as Agent Piccadilly was quizzed by a film-maker this year about his involvement in the assassination of Markov, which he repeatedly denied. Bulgaria said police files which led investigators to Gullino, brought no clarity over who was the killer

Asked by filmmakers if he is still in 
contact with his Bulgarian contact from the 1970s, he declined to give a
straight answer, replying with a smile: 'This is an intimate question. 
Is it forbidden to talk to such people? Is it not good to work with 
foreign countries' secret services?'

Bulgarian
journalist Anthony Georgieff, who has also been on the trail of Gullino
for two decades, said: 'In reality, if the British authorities wanted 
to arrest him they probably could. But there is a lot of embarrassment 
surrounding this case.

'The 
British allowed a defector to be murdered right under their noses and 
then the killer escaped. I think that might explain  their reluctance to
vigorously pursue it.'

But in spite of this new information coming to light, Bulgarian authorities say they have not reached any clarity about the identity of the killer.
