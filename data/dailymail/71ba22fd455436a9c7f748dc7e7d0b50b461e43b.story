Ashley De Luca, 27, bragged on Facebook about his criminal lifestyle

A thief who bragged he had a Master's degree in burglary, robbery and shoplifting has been jailed.

Ashley De Luca, 27, admitted stealing alcohol, sweets and food from supermarkets across Faversham in Kent since March this year.

He also dressed up as a policeman on March 13 this year in a bid to steal from a garage but ran off empty-handed.

He pleaded guilty to seven counts of shoplifting, burglary, threatening behaviour, two counts of failing to surrender to court bail and wearing a police uniform with intent to deceive at Mid Kent Magistrates' Court last month.

He was jailed for 119 days and ordered to pay £150 in compensation. 

But on his Facebook page, De Luca boasted about his criminal lifestyle - and posted a photo of Al Pacino as Scarface as his hero.

Under the work and education category, he wrote: 'City and guilds masters degree in burglary, robbery, shoplifting, scrap metal (mostly copper), MC'in, drinkin people under the table, telling it like it is, makin money, dealing wid the matter.'

He continued: 'If you have a job don't hesitate to contact me and I can remove all goods properly and professionally.'

Photos on his Facebook page include a bank robber with a balaclava and a shotgun and evil Chucky from the Child's Play movies. 

Mid Kent JPs heard his other crimes, committed while on a suspended sentence for theft, included stealing alcohol from Sainsbury's in Faversham on March 30, April 8 and June 20 - worth £62 in all.
