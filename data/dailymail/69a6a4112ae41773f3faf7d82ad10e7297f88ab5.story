The house that stood in as murder victim Laura Palmer's home on cult series Twin Peaks has been put on the market

The death of Laura Palmer was Twin Peak's central mystery over the show's two seasons

Since the show went off the air, dedicated fans continue to flock to the house in Everett, Wash.

The house features a number of amenities including a rec room

Owner Marilyn Pettersen has says she was happy to have her home featured on the eerie drama but found the show too dark for her tastes

Owner Marilyn Pettersen
 was approached in 1989 about using her house on the show when she woke 
up one morning to find a film company agent on her doorstep.

'She said: 'Well, I'm from the movie company and working on a movie for ABC TV. They would like to 
use your home in the movie,’' She remembered. 'She was a little tiny
 young gal, and I thought, ‘Yeah, and I’m the queen of England.'

The show's eerie aesthetic made characters like agent Dale Cooper a household name in the early 90s

The beautiful homes sits on a 8,712-square-foot lot in Washington

The four-bedroom home was filmed for episodes of the ABC show starting in 1989

Though it's best known for its connection to a famous, fictional murder victim, the spacious home is brightly lit and comfortably furnished

Rolling Stone reports that both
 the house's exterior and interior were used for the show's pilot 
episode as well as the David Lynch directed film 'Twin Peaks: Fire Walk 
With Me.'

A second house was used later in the series.

Over the course of two seasons on ABC, Twin Peaks became a cult hit and was nominated for multiple Golden Globe and Emmy awards.

Owner Pettersen said she didn't believe it when a young agent approached her about using the house for a national television show

Besides the stocked kitchen the house also features a bathroom, a powder room, a sun room, a rec room and a two-car garage

The home was built in the1930s near Rucker Hill Park but stood in for a residence in the fictional town of Twin Peaks, Alaska

The
 filmmakers reportedly wanted the home because it looked like the type 
of house a prosperous attorney like Palmer's father would live in, yet 
also be believable as something the 'neurotic wife' character could 
fix-up.

'To look in your living room and see this huge camera on a runner coming
 toward you, it was just kind of mind-boggling,' Pettersen said.

The two-car garage will give buyers plenty of space for their cars and residents of the fictional town of Twin Peaks space to hide a body or two

Buyers will find themselves not just with a new home but owning a piece of television history

Besides
 a piece of television history, buyers will get a four bedroom and 
one-and-a-half bathroom house with hardwood floors, drywall ceilings, 
and French doors.

There is also a formal living room, updated kitchen, and a study.

The house rests on spacious property and features a detached two-car garage.
