A plastic surgeon has called for a change to the way a German battalion does its rifle drill after its elite soldiers started developing breasts.

Dozens of soldiers in the Wachbataillon unit (Guard Battalion), which performs drill displays at official events, have complained about over-developed breasts on their left-hand side because of the way they clasp their rifles.

It is understood the repeated slapping of their rifles against their chests has stimulated hormones, causing a condition known as one-sided gynecomastia.

The Wachbataillon is the Germany's elite drill unit.

The Wachbataillon is the largest battalion of the German forces with about 1,800 soldiers, split between garrisons in Berlin and Siegburg.

It is made up of nine companies and its primary responsibility is to perform the military honours for the German president, the German Chancellor, the Federal Minister of Defence and the Inspector General of the Bundeswehr during state visits or similar occasions.

Its soldiers are not allowed to grow beards or moustaches and until recently were only admitted if they were between 5 ft 10 in and 6 ft 4 in in height.

The condition has been diagnosed in 74 per cent of the soldiers who have visited German army medics with symptoms.

Professor Bjorn Krapohl, director of plastic surgery at the military hospital in Berlin, told the German Herald: 'There is a very significant link between the activity in the Guard 
Battalion and the development of the breast on the left side.

'They need to change the way they drill.

'The constant slamming of the rifles against the left hand side of the chest is clearly a significant factor.'

Official figures reveal that out of 211 male patients operated on for the condition, 35 were from the elite Wachbataillon.

Military officials have said they will research the condition and adapt the battalion's drills if necessary.

An army spokesman said: 'The affected soldiers are being medically supervised and treated individually.'
