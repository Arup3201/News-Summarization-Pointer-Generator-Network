Former Monaco and Tottenham star Glenn Hoddle has predicted a 'difficult' evening for Arsenal as they try to stage a Champions League comeback against Monaco on Tuesday.

The Gunners' European hopes are hanging by a thread following a 3-1 capitulation against the French side in the first leg at the Emirates.

Hoddle, who was part of the Monaco side that won the league title under Arsene Wenger in 1988, is doubtful that Arsenal will be able to score three goals at the Stade Louis II - a feat that hasn't been managed by any other team in the last 42 months.

Speaking to TV station beIN SPORTS, Hoddle said: 'It will be an emotional game for Arsene Wenger, to return here. Difficult.

'Arsenal are playing very well now, they're quick and technical, but AS Monaco are tough defensively.'

Arsenal warmed up for the crucial decider with a 3-0 victory over West Ham on Saturday, while Monaco defeated Bastia by the same scoreline on Friday - giving the Ligue 1 side an extra 24hours rest.

Meanwhile, another former Monaco player Mark Hateley believes the contrasting styles between the two teams should lead to a 'fascinating' encounter. 

'I think Arsenal are obviously very attacking minded, like to go forward and score lots of goals. I think Monaco are very, very well organised defensively, they are a good group, they play with great discipline, said the former England striker. 

'So it'll be a fascinating game. A good game to watch.'
