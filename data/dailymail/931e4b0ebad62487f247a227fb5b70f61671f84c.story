A have-a-go hero was savagely beaten by a gang of men after he stepped in to rescue a woman who was being attacked in the street.

Selfless David Bourne, 36, spotted the terrified woman being held in a headlock as he walked home from The Lincoln Arms in Spalding, Lincolnshire, after a darts match.

Brave David tried to free the woman, but one of the men punched him and two others joined in the brutal attack - battering him in the face.

The good samaritan, from Spalding, Lincolshire was knocked out cold on the ground, but managed to stagger home with a badly smashed upper jaw and two black eyes.

Now his girlfriend Pauline Walton, 45, has launched a campaign on Facebook to help Lincolnshire Police find David’s attackers.

Bizarrely, men as the woman was not really in need of help.

Pauline said: 'He was standing after the first hit but next he knew he was waking up on the floor.

'He has a broken jaw, two black eyes, lumps the size of eggs on his eyebrow and the back of his head and his right hand side of his face is swollen like a balloon.

'He is a mess.

'Anybody will tell you David is a lovely bloke. He will do anything for anybody.

'We hope the police get whoever did this. We are leaving it in the hands of the police and let them do their job.'

David’s sister Trisha Bourne, 45, said: 'They have made a right mess of him. He is in a hell of a lot of pain.

'We are hoping that once all the swelling has gone down he won’t have to have surgery on his jaw - fingers crossed.

'The police have told us that it might have been a set up and the woman was not really in need of help.

'What an awful trick to play on someone. People should look out for each other, but now after his experience David says he will not step in to help people in the future.'

David was walking home from a darts match at The Lincoln Arms in Spalding, Lincolnshire, when he spotted a woman in trouble outside St Mary and St Nicolas Church.

The forklift driver intervened to help the woman at about 10.30pm, but he was attacked by the men and fell to the floor.

Luckily David managed to pick himself and stagger home while he phoned his girlfriend Pauline for help at about 11.25pm.

Pauline rushed David to Pilgrim Hospital in Boston, Lincolnshire, and on Thursday he was transferred to Lincoln County Hospital where surgeons hope to mend his jaw.

David’s family have launched a Facebook appeal for information which has been inundated with messages condemning the attack.

DC Paul Gurney, from Lincolnshire Police, said he is investigating the incident.
