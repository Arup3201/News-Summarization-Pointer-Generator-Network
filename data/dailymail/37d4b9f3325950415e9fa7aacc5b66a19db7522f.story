With Chelsea and Arsenal on the horizon, we’ll have a clearer idea about West Ham’s top-four credentials by the time those Christmas decorations are stored away for another year.

Those daunting clashes, however, hold no fear for Hammers boss Sam Allardyce.

‘We challenge Chelsea and Arsenal on the back of what we’ve done up until now,’ said Allardyce.

92: The number of days since Leicester last won a game — the 5-3 victory against Manchester United in September.

12: The number of games Leicester have gone without a victory (two draws and 10 losses).2 The number of Premier League teams who have escaped relegation after being bottom of the table at Christmas (West Brom in 2004-05 and Sunderland 2013-14).

-14: - Leicester’s goal difference is the joint worst in the league with Burnley.

17th: Leicester’s position in the table at Christmas in their last season in the Premier League (2003-04).

19.2: The number of shots, on average, Leicester concede per away game — the most in the league.

13.3: The number of fouls, on average, Leicester commit per game — the joint-highest in the league with Crystal Palace.

‘It eases the pressure on us, the fact we can go there and see if we can go and challenge ourselves against two of the big boys in this league and see if we can get any points off them.

‘We’ve earned the right to go to try to see if we can do that. As difficult as it might be, I think the lads are confident enough to think they may have the capabilities of doing it.

‘If we don’t, it’s not going to be too much of a knock back for us, because we know we can catch up by beating teams who are below us, like Leicester and teams like that, which we’ve done particularly well this year.

‘It’s a nice time, I think, for us to be playing Chelsea and Arsenal.’

Saturday’s comfortable win over Leicester — courtesy of goals from Andy Carroll and Stewart Downing — consolidated West Ham’s place in the top four going into the Boxing Day visit to Stamford Bridge.

Time will tell if Allardyce can complete a huge turnaround in the club’s fortunes by securing Champions League football.

West Ham were booed off by their own supporters, fed up by what they perceived as the manager’s long-ball tactics, following a victory against Hull in March. 

Allardyce looked certain to be sacked in the summer but owners David Sullivan and David Gold’s decision to stick with their manager has been vindicated.

How the Hammers cope with the loss of Diafra Sakho, Alex Song and Cheikou Kouyate, who are expected to be called up for Africa Cup of Nations duty next month, could have a bearing on the club’s European ambitions.

But for the moment, Allardyce is enjoying life in the upper echelons of the Premier League.

‘There was a time last season when the players felt that no matter what they did, we would get battered by people,’ said the former Bolton chief.

‘Everyone is going to have a bad spell; that is the Premier League — it happens to everyone.

West Ham and Allardyce will learn this week whether a work permit will be given Doneil Henry

‘Obviously at this moment if we carry on as we are, we are predicted a top-four finish, but whether we will or we won’t is another matter.’

Meanwhile, West Ham will find out this week if they get a work permit they need to complete a £1.5million move for Canada centre back Doneil Henry. 

The central defender is on loan at Toronto FC from Cypriot side Apollon Limassol.
