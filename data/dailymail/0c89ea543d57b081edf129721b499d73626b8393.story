Death rates relating to almost 5,000 surgeons have today been published, with just three doctors falling below the standards expected of them, it has emerged.

Data published as part of a 'transparency drive' by the NHS reveals mortality rates across 13 different surgery specialties, including cardiac, lung cancer and vascular surgery.

It shows 'almost all surgeons' are 'within the limits expected by the NHS'.

Just three surgeons - a vascular, heart and colorectal consultant surgeon - were named as 'outliers', those found to be performing below the limits expected.

Jonathan Hyde, a heart surgeon at the Royal Sussex County Hospital, was among those whose death rates were found to be significantly worse than average, when the data was collated 18 months ago.

Mr Hyde performs a vast number of very high risk operations, a spokesman for Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals Trust, told MailOnline.

He was found to have a risk-adjusted hospital mortality rate of 6.63 per cent over a three-year period, during which he performed more than 500 surgeries.

Dr Stephen Holmberg, Medical Director for Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals, said: 'The data shown was taken more than 18 months ago and in the light of these outcomes, we reviewed Jonathan Hyde's practice in detail with the support of an Individual Review from the Royal College of Surgeons. 

'The unadjusted mortality rates for his surgery for the period April 2013 to October 2014 was 1.8 per cent, which is within the expected rates. 

'We have a track record for accepting very high risk patients including a significant number of patients with active endocarditis for whom even a high surgical risk is seen as offering a better outcome than medical management. 

Hospital consultants who refuse to publish their patient death rates will be sacked under a transparency drive, the NHS revelaed this week.

Cancer units will also have to publish statistics showing how many patients survive their treatment, allowing patients to compare services.

The warning came days before a third of the country's consultants were expected to refuse to publish their performance statistics today.

Sir Bruce keogh, medical director of NHS England, warned that from next year consultants who do not allow their data to be published will not pass their five-yearly revalidation or be awarded financial bonuses.

'Since the data was taken more than 18 months ago, the unit has reviewed many of its protocols and practices which have been informed and updated by an Invited Review from the Royal College of Surgeons and the effectiveness of these changes is evidenced by unadjusted mortality rates for the unit in 2013 and 2014 of 2.6 per cent and 1.8 per cent respectively, which are within the expected rates.'

Jeff Garner, a colorectal surgeon at Rotherham NHS Foundation Trust, was identified as another surgeon with below average mortality rates.

Of 50 patients treated by Mr Garner over an 18-month period, six died, giving him a mortality rate of 14 per cent.

David Hicks, acting medical director at the trust, told MailOnline: 'This Trust has acknowledged its outlier status and that of one of its surgeons.

'It has confirmed that measures have been taken to improve outcomes with a comprehensive overhaul of the colorectal service in 2012-2013 and close scrutiny of any deaths to identify potential surgical or system failings. 

'The cumulative nature of data reporting means that it is likely to be at least another year before the Trust and surgeon cease to be outliers.

'Rotherham Hospital serves one of the more deprived communities in the country and the colorectal service accepts very high risk patients with multiple co-morbidities, which increases the risk of complications following colorectal cancer surgery. 

'The investigations at the Trust into each of the six deaths highlighted within the report confirms that they were high risk/complex patients.

'We have made significant changes to the pre-operative assessment and risk adjustment, prehabilitation and post-operative management of patients undergoing major colorectal surgery, which has resulted in a reduction in mortality at Rotherham Hospital. 

'The data published regarding Mr Garner is in excess of 18 months old, but as part of the Trust’s review of Mr Garner’s practice we are able to confirm that from April 2013-August 2014 he has performed 45 colorectal cancers resections with zero mortality.'

The third 'outlier' surgeon is Dynesh Rittoo, a vascular surgeon at the Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospitals Foundation Trust.

He was found to have a risk-adjusted mortality rate of 10.4 per cent over three years for carotid endarterectomies - an operation to reduce the risk of a person suffering a stroke.

The national average for the same procedure was two per cent.  

The trust told the Telegraph: 'The overall three-year rate for Mr Rittoo reflects a series of strokes in 2011.

'The rate of strokes / deaths within 30 days for Mr Rittoo between October 2011 and September 2013 is 6.4 per cent, and this rate is consistent with the outcomes of other vascular surgeons.'

NHS England first launched the league tables last year, but extended the data available to cover 13 specialties and an extra 1,000 consultant surgeons for 2014. 

The data is being published on a new website MyNHS, allowing patients to compare critical data about hospitals, and the professionals who will treat them. 

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the NHS is 'blazing a trail across the world as the first major health economy to adopt this kind of culture'

In a speech today, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, is expected to say: 'Transparency is about patient outcomes, not process targets.

'It uses the power of a learning culture and of peer review, not blame.

'Healthcare globally has been slow to develop the kind of safety culture based on openness and transparency that has become normal in the airline, oil and nuclear industries. 

'The NHS is now blazing a trail across the world as the first major health economy to adopt this kind of culture.'

NHS England's medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh who has championed better transparency in the NHS, said the website will help to drive up standards.

'This represents another major step forward on the transparency journey,' he said.

'It will help drive up standards, and we are committed to expanding publication into other areas.

'The results demonstrate that surgery in this country is as good as anywhere in the western world and, in some specialties, it is better.

'The surgical community in this country deserves a great deal of credit for being a world leader in this area.'

At the weekend Sir Bruce said penalties will be enforced against hospital consultants who refuse to publish patient death rates, with around 2,500 believed to not be taking part in the initiative.

He told the Sunday Times said: 'We are looking now at a series of inducements, penalties to force that (publishing death rates).'

He added: 'We will lose some surgeons. We will, and have as a consequence of this endeavour.'

NHS England's medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh who has championed better transparency in the NHS, said the website will help to drive up standards

But critics said the move to publish surgeon's performance data is 'crude and misleading'.

John MacFie, president of the Federation of Surgical Speciality Associations, which represents surgeons, said: 'There is now good anecdotal evidence that shows publishing this data has encouraged risk-averse behaviour, which is not in the interest of patients.

'I believe that the data should only be published after any concerns in a surgeon's performance have been investigated.

'In reality very few deaths can be attributed to surgical error alone, and this data only attracts attention away from institutional failings. Put simply, hospitals should not be allowing surgeons to practice unless they can demonstrate their practice is safe.'

Work to compile the data has again been led by the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP), which manages the National Clinical Audit programme on behalf of NHS England.
