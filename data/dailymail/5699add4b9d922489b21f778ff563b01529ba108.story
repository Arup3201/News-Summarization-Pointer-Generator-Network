A Monet painting that hung in the Fifth Avenue apartment that reclusive heiress Huguette Clark left all but abandoned for twenty years sold at auction Tuesday for $27 million.

'Water Lilies' Monet's 1907 rendition of his beloved garden in Giverny, France, went to an undisclosed Asian buyer in the season-opening auction of impressionist and modern art at Christie's.

The painting, part of Clark's collection since 1930, has not been publicly exhibited since 1926 and the millionaire herself likely never saw it during her final two decades that she spent in a Manhattan hospital.

Christie's is selling hundreds of items from Clark's collection after a feud over her estate was settled in the fall.

Starting May 6, Christie's began a series of sales as the estate of the mysterious millionaire, who died in 2011 aged 104, is divided up.

Among the 400 items of fine art, rare manuscripts and collection of beautiful musical instruments, are lots expected to reach many millions dollars.

Some of the items included in the collection, which was started by Miss Clark's father, are so rare that Christie's has exhibited them at its auction houses in Tokyo, Hong Kong, and London, as well as in New York.

Miss Clark was the last surviving child of Senator. William A. Clark, who was born in a log cabin and became one of the wealthiest men of his day.He is the namesake of Nevada's Clark County and established its county seat, Las Vegas.

A onetime socialite who became a social shadow, Miss Clark died at 104 in 2011. She had a penthouse and two other apartments on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue and exquisite homes in Santa Barbara, California, and New Canaan, Connecticut, but she chose to spend her last 20 years in a hospital.

She couldn't even see it: The world class work of art hung in the dining room of Clark's Fifth Avenue apartment, which she all but abandoned in her final 20 years

The art collector also loved music, and several of her instruments are included in the auction, including 6ft tall Louis XV-style concert harp, which is expected to go for $3,000 to $5,000.

A collection of rare and valuable paintings collected by the art lover are also being offered at auction.

They include three Renoirs, including one Miss Clark bought for $125,000 which is expected to sell for $10 million, and a waterlily painting by Monet, which has not been publicly exhibited since 1926.

Miss Clark bought the 1905 painting, Nymphéas, in 1930 and it spent the next 80 years hanging in the dining room of her sumptuous Fifth Avenue apartment. It is expected to attract up to $35 million when it is sold on May 6, along with the Renoirs.

Eye for art: Renoir's Chrysanthèmes was also part of the auction

American great: Girl Fishing at San Vigilio by John Singer Sargent from the Clark collection, is to be sold in June

A William Merritt Chase painting, A Water Fountain in Prospect Park, expected to fetch $1 million, and John Singer Sargent’s Girl Fishing at San Vigilio, which is estimated to make more than $3 million, will be auctioned in a later sale on June 18.

Miss Clark didn't just admire art, she painted herself. A self-portrait and her palette will be included in the sale of the family collection.

The June auction, An American Dynasty: The Clark Family Treasures, combines the bulk of the heiress's extensive collection of books, instruments and paintings.

A 16th Century, beautifully illustrated copy of Book of Hours, and a first edition of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass, printed in Brooklyn in 1855, are among the highlights of the book sale.

The Book of Hours is expected to sell for at least $40,000 and the Whitman is anticipated to go for $100,000 to $150,000.

The entire sale is expected to make about $70 million, and some of the proceeds will go towards a settlement from the disputed will between Miss Clark's nurse and her distant relatives.

With no close relatives, Miss Clark left a roughly $300 million estate and a swirl of questions about the input she had received from a close circle of caregivers and advisers, and about the extensive gifts and bequests she had given them in return.

She signed two wills within six weeks at age 98, the first bequeathing her riches mostly to about 20 distant relatives and the second cutting them out.

The September settlement mainly benefited arts institutions and the distant relations.

Some of Miss Clark's real estate and possessions had already been sold. A 2012 Christie's auction of 17 pieces of her jewelry, including a pink nine-carat diamond ring, brought in about $21 million.
