A teenage girl claims she was set up by BBC producers after unwittingly taking part in a documentary about bad driving.

Amy Smith, 18, said she was tricked into taking part after responding to an advert asking for ‘fun and confident groups of friends’.

The former private schoolgirl said she signed up believing it would be a reality TV series similar to ITV’s The Only Way Is Essex.

'Fooled': Amy Smith, 18 from Halifax, West Yorkshire, thought the BBC was filming her every day life for a glamorous reality television show, when they were in fact documenting her bad driving

But to her horror, she was actually 
being filmed for a documentary about bad teenage driving - with cameras 
capturing her every mistake on the road.

Her blunders will now be exposed in a series called Barely Legal Drivers, beginning tonight (April 2) on BBC3.

The BBC admitted she was tricked into 
taking part but said she signed a consent form after she found out the 
real aim of the programme.

But Miss Smith said she only realised when she saw the programme’s trailer last week how stupid she had been made to look.

BBC producers told her she needed a 
car for the programme, so despite having only just passed her test, she 
borrowed one especially.

She was filmed on glamour modelling 
auditions and going shopping - but it was only at the end of the week 
that producers revealed the programme would focus on her driving.

She said: ‘I’ve been set up. They’ve 
made me look really stupid. I couldn’t understand why they kept wanting 
me to get in the car and drive all these far distances. They’re not 
journeys I would ever normally do.’

Films of Miss Smith driving were shown
 to her mother and to a former traffic officer to comment on - with 
prizes of a car or advanced driving lessons awarded according to 
performance.

The youngster, who had never been on a motorway, is shown stopping on a sliproad while cars came past at 70mph.

During another trip, she skips a red light and is almost hit by a bus as she makes a right turn in its path.

'I’ve been set up. They’ve made me look really stupid. I couldn’t understand why they kept wanting me to get in the car and drive all these far distances. They’re not journeys I would ever normally do'

Amy Smith

She added: ‘I thought it was going to be like The Only Way Is Essex, but I was never filmed having my nails or hair done.

‘That week was hell. I’m not a diva, 
I’m easy going and can take a lot of stress but at the end I lost my 
temper and was in tears.

‘I had no idea I would be driving to 
these venues or that they would be filming me on the way. If I had known
 it was about driving I would never have taken part.’

Miss Smith signed up with producers after spotting an advert on a talent scouting website for a programme called ‘We Are Young’.

It read: ‘We will be following the day
 to day lives of a select number of teenagers exploring the modern world
 from the eyes of the young’.

The beauty student signed up after an 
interview with producers at Renegade Pictures, which made the film for 
the BBC, and agreed to be filmed for a week last October.

Miss Smith and her mother both signed consent forms when the premise of the film was explained to them.

'She never bought into a driving programme. It was supposed to be all about filming her with her friends on a night out'

Her mother, Lisa, 47, was told about 
it at the beginning of the filming and said she played along because of 
the prizes promised.

However, they say it was only last 
week when they saw the trailer that they realised how irresponsible the 
teenage drivers were portrayed to be.

The title had been changed from ‘We 
Are Young’ to ‘Barely Legal Drivers’ and footage of Miss Smith’s 
mistakes are spliced in with that of other teenagers behaving badly.

One teenager in the trailer admits she drives best ‘while tipsy’ while another teenager blows up a condom while driving.

Mrs Smith, a car saleswoman, said: 
‘She never bought into a driving programme. It was supposed to be all 
about filming her with her friends on a night out.

‘They were putting words in to her 
mouth all the time. Her driving mistakes were made out of inexperience 
but her attitude was bang on. They were pushing her into making 
mistakes.’

'We are surprised Amy is saying these things as once the real purpose of the show had been revealed she was happy to sign the release form and she has also seen highlights of the show'

BBC spokesman

Last night, the BBC said she had been asked to go on ‘three normal journeys’ and denied there had been pressure from producers.

A spokesman said: ‘As with many 
documentaries the final title is not confirmed until nearer the 
transmission so “We are Young” continued to be the working title.

‘We are surprised Amy is saying these 
things as once the real purpose of the show had been revealed she was 
happy to sign the release form and she has also seen highlights of the 
show.

‘She is on camera talking about how much she enjoyed the advanced driving lessons. In addition the consent forms the 
parents were asked to sign are so thorough they leave no doubt as to 
what the real programme is about.’
