A lawyer from Oakland California faces legal issues of her own after being found guilty of failing to properly care for her 93 cats and her two dogs.

Jan Van Dusen, 62, was found guilty on Thursday of letting her cats suffer from starvation, diarrhea, parasite infections and other diseases.

Some of her many cats, a bunch of whom were once stray, had to be euthanized.

Van Dusen will be sentenced on July 25 an could face up to three years in prison.

SF Gate reports that Van Dusen's attorney Frank Often doesnâ€™t believe his client should serve jail time.

'It's my belief that she should get probation,' said Offen.

Van Dusen's felony conviction means she could serve time behind bars and that she could be suspended or disbarred from her job as a lawyer.

When Oakland Animal Control officers went to Van Dusen's home in October 2011 they found 93 cats and two dogs in less than suitable conditions.

16 of the felines had to be put down because they suffered from incurable diseases and 77 other cats were treated by veterinarians at a shelter and were later put up for adoption.

'Things were mostly under control,' she told SF Gate in 2012.

'They killed some of my favorites, which they had no right to do.'

Van Dusen has said in the past that she is a great animal caretaker and that all her cats had been neutered and spayed.

Van Dusen was known to take in stray and wild cats and later find homes for them. She socialized in cat enthusiast circles and was a popular member of several.

She started collecting cats in the mid-1990s and worked with several animal non-profit groups.

Back in 2011 Van Dusen actually found some success in the court room when she won a precedent setting case against the Internal Revenue Service, reported SF Gate.

Van Dusen claimed that her cat rescue dollars were a donation to an IRS approved charity and that they should be deductible.

Luckily for her that time, a Tax court judge was swayed.
