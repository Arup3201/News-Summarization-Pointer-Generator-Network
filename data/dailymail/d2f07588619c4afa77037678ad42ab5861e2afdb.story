Thriller: Counter-terrorism expert Neil Livingstone's biography reads like a real-life man of international intrigue

His past exploits as a counter-terrorism agent could have come straight from the plot of a James Bond thriller.

He has  fled angry Nazis in Argentina, been interrogated in 1980s Libya, dined with Russian mafioso and explored 
tunnels beneath the demilitarized zone separating the Koreas.

But now former mercenary Neil Livingstone, 65, is trying to put that extraordinary past behind him as he takes on his latest mission: to become Montana's next governor.

The role, where chairing the state land board and congratulating state football champions could count as an exciting day, would be a significant change of pace.

The former secret agent, who says he was once wrongly subpoenaed for gun running and involvement in the Iran-Contra affair, may not want his colourful history putting off voters in his home state.

Like the time 
he was on the yacht belonging to a swashbuckling pirate whose other 
guests included numerous hookers?

He was on a mission, he says, securing private planes to spy on a foreign country.

Libyan documents leaked last year 
stated that Livingstone was among a small group seeking a multi-million 
dollar payday to help Moammar Gadhafi find a safe haven.

Livingstone, who has been a vocal critic of Gadhafi, said he was trying to bring a quick end to the bloodshed.

The deal was rebuffed by the Obama administration.

Livingstone, a Republican, doesn't think his extraordinary background or his list of controversial past clients harms his chances.

He said: ‘Without going into detail that I can't, I have served as a liaison for my government and others in terms of dealing with most of the difficult people on Earth.

‘There is a necessity to work with some of the bad guys in the world. You are not going to find these people in church or wherever.

‘I am not recommending prostitution to anyone, nor did I say I engaged with prostitutes,’ Livingstone said of the yacht episode. ‘I took my wife. She was the only non-hooker on board.’

This spectacular list of exploits was removed from his campaign website late last week after he decided that ‘salacious’ excerpts from his long biography could give people the wrong idea.

Livingstone most recently ran a company he started in 2007 called Executive Action — the same term used by the CIA in the 1950s to refer to their assassination operations.

He started that company after leaving another called GlobalOptions Inc., which billed itself as a ‘private CIA.’

Livingstone said in an interview that he wound down operations at Executive Action in order to return full time to his home state and run for governor.

Two individuals with intricate knowledge of the business, however, told The Associated Press in interviews that Livingstone had no choice but to lay off staff and close the doors.

The former associates, speaking only on the condition of anonymity due in part to the close-knit nature of intelligence-related businesses, said Executive Action's only substantial client stopped paying and it was unable to recruit other meaningful business.

Not true, said Livingstone. Unwinding the company was a ‘conscious decision,’ but he couldn't delve into details for ‘reasons that are obvious.’

The front page of Livingstone's campaign website features revolving photos, including one of him and his running mate, former Navy SEAL and current state senator Ryan Zinke, standing back-to-back holding pistols.

Governor 007, anyone?
