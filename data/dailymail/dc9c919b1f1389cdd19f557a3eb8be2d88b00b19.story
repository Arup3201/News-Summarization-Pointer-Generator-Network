In less than 24 hours a smiling Angela Ferullo would be dead.

In stunning family pictures of the 43-year-old at what should have been one of the most exciting times of her life, Ms Ferullo smiles beside her daughter Letitia at the christening of Letitia's baby Sierra.

But in truth, stress and panic was already gripping Ms Ferullo. Less than a day later she would die in a frenzied attack after she threw herself in in front of her knife-wielding ex-husband in order to protect five months pregnant daughter Selina and Selina's unborn child.

Less than 24 hours to live: Despite her smiles Angela Ferullo (right) was too stressed by threats from her crazed ex husband James Payet to pose for many more than this photograph with daughter Letitia at the christening of Letitia's baby Sierra. Following the 45 minutes church service, Ferullo left 'in  a panic'. A day later she was dead

Little did they know: Despite Angela Ferullo's fears for the safety of her family at the christening of baby Sierra (above, pictured in mother Letitia's arms at Christ the King Church in Perth), they could not know the escalating threats of Ferullo's ex husband James Payet would lead to his stabbing her to death and she leapt to protect her pregnant daughter Selina (on the right)

Happy times cut short: the joy of baby Sierra's christening above shows on the faces of the Bello family, including mother Letitia (right). But a day later Letitia's mother Angela Ferullo would lie bleeding to death in the family hair salon after Ms Ferullo threw herself in front of her knife wielding ex-husband to save pregnant daughter Selina (centre) and her unborn baby's life

The attack by James Payet, who is not the father of Letitia and Selina, left Ms Ferullo fatally injured and Ms Bello with slash wounds.

Ms Bello recovered from her injuries and gave birth to a healthy baby boy, Emilio, who is now five months old.

James Payet has pleaded guilty to murder and kidnap and will be sentenced in the West Australian Supreme Court on Friday.

In sentencing submissions for the murderer the West Australian Supreme Court heard Payet had repeatedly threatened Ms Ferullo in the days leading up to the attack in June last year.

Fiercely protective: Angela Ferullo, pictured with her youngest daughter at the christening last June of her baby granddaughter Sierra, left the church soon after this photograph was taken, skipping the reception for fear that her presence would put her family in danger of attack by her violent ex-husband, James Payet

Worst fears: Angela Ferullo, pictured above with her daughters, pregnant Leitia (right) and Selina (left) at Letitia's baby shower last year when Ms Ferullo had separated from her crazed ex-husband who would eventually kill her during an attack on Selina

On June 23 last year, the day of her granddaughter Sierra's christening, Ms Ferullo was so worried by her ex-husband's threats she was 'stressed' and 'panicked' during the 45 minute ceremony, posed only for a few photographs and left early, skipping the reception.

'She was worried [James Payet] would come to the church and threaten the girls,' a friend said, 'she was freaking out and kept checking her phone.

'She thought he might turn up any minute and hurt someone.'

Fatal rage: In the days leading up to the murder James Bill Payet had made threats against his ex-wife, who was about to go to court to take out an order against him. But he stormed into the hairdressing salon where Angela Ferullo and her pregnant daughter Selina Bello were and attacked them with  a knife

On June 24, Ms Ferullo was at the hairdressing salon she owned with her daughter. She was planning to go to court to obtain a restraining order against Payet.

Police had already made an order against Payet to stay away from Ms Ferullo after he made several threats to confronted her at her granddaughter's christening.

Unbeknown to Ms Ferullo, who had spent the night prior to the murder staying elsewhere, Payet was hiding in the roof of her house and had confronted her male housemate, threatened him with a knife, and held him captive for two hours while demanding he call Ms Ferullo to tell her to come home.

The housemate managed to escape Payet and jump over a back fence, but was chased to a nearby primary school where Payet managed to slash his shoulder and arm.

Payet convinced a passing driver to try to pick him and they briefly pursued the housemate, who Payet claimed had broken into his home, before he asked to be dropped off and then drove a borrowed car to Ms Ferullo's salon.

The housemate had alerted police, who were too late to prevent Payet bursting into the salon and attacking Ms Ferullo and her daughter.

After failing to reach the housemate, Payet told the unsuspecting driver to drop him off elsewhere. He then borrowed a car and drove to Ms Ferullo's salon.

The housemate asked the school to call police, who were on the phone to Ms Ferullo when a frenzied Payet burst into the salon.

He first attacked Ms Bello, but turned on Ms Ferullo when she intervened to save her daughter.

Healthy boy: Despite suffering serious wounds in the knife attack which killed her mother Selina Bello gave birth to a health baby boy who is now five months old,

Payet fled the scene and a massive manhunt ensued. He was caught when he later sought hospital treatment for self-inflicted wounds.

Ms Bello and her unborn baby survived the attack, and her son, Emilio, was born late last year.

In February, Payet, 48, pleaded guilty to murdering Ms Ferullo and causing grievous bodily harm to Ms Bello.  In a Facebook post, Ms Bello said some justice had been served after seven months of 'hell'.

'Mum, not a day goes by that we don't think about you and the great loss we have experienced,” she wrote on Facebook.

'Hopefully, now you can rest easy knowing that justice has and will be served.'

Ms Bello has posted photographs of herself and five-month-old Emilio on Facebook, along with a loving message for her mother's birthday.

'Mum you were the strongest most inspirational woman I ever had the pleasure of knowing,' Ms Bello wrote. 'It tears me apart knowing that your not here with us celebrating today.

'There was never a problem that was unsolvable and never a question to hard. There was always room for friends and family and you never turned you back on anyone.

'I hope your looking down on us holding you head high with pride assured knowing that you will never be forgotten and your legacy will always live on through your 4 children.'
