One of Britain’s oldest private schools is set to ditch its £10,000 annual fees and become a free school - blaming Britain's stuttering economy.

Pupil numbers at Queen Elizabeth’s Grammar School, in Blackburn, Lancashire, have plunged from 1,200 in 1997 to just 478 now as its head admitted today people just cannot afford to send their children.

QEGS was founded in 1509 and given its royal charter nearly 60 years later by Queen Elizabeth I, but is now bidding to become a free school, funded by taxpayers.

Yesterday school leaders told staff, pupils and parents about their plans to apply for the change next year.

The move has been criticised by union bosses as ‘a cynical move to get taxpayers to fund private education’ while concerns have been expressed on the impact on nearby schools which could lose pupils. 

Backing: Local MP Jack Straw agrees the school should forget its fees and allow anyone to join

Parents currently pay £10,236 per year 
in fees, with around 25 per cent of current students receiving some kind
of bursary. If it becomes a free school the Government would pay £4,500
per pupil.

Headmaster Simon Corns said: 'The local economy is such that it’s becoming increasingly difficult, even for high earning parents, to afford fees for education and that got us thinking about how we can positively move forwards.

'This will allow more pupils to come to the school and receive an excellent education.

'Despite our exam successes, it’s down to economics.'

Mr Corns said if successful, the new status would take effect from September 2014 and the final entrance exam would take place in January 2013.

A decision is expected next Spring but fees would still be expected for the 2013/14 year.

'We plan to return to around 1,100 pupils, which we believe we will be able to do.

'It’s possible we will get some backlash. However, I don’t think many parents will have chosen the school because of its exclusivity.'

Free schools were introduced by Education Secretary Michael Gove as part of his controversial schools shake-up.

They receive their payments directly from Government, but are not controlled by the local education authority.

Founded in 1509 as Henry VIII came to the throne  - the school survived the Reformation and in 1567 was granted a Royal Charter by Queen Elizabeth I.

After moving to a new site in the 19th century its premises hosted early Blackburn Rovers games.

The school became know as Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School, offering free education, before becoming a fee-charging school in the 20th century.

Notable former pupils include footballer James Beattie, Channel Four's Krishnan Guru-Murthy, TV presenter Russell Harty, designer Wayne Hemingway and film director Michael Winterbottom.

If QEGS is granted permission it will still be able to set its own extended curriculum, term dates and length of school day.

Simon Jones, NUT Union Blackburn with Darwen secretary and national executive member, said: 'Regardless of where they have come from, free schools are neither wanted nor needed.

'They are only going to cause further havoc with the local authority admission planning for school places.

'I believe this is a cynical move to get taxpayers to fund private education that parents previously paid for and that there are plenty of excellent community comprehensives to choose from.”

He said the change could also impact on other schools in the area as QEGS would be seeking to take on 600 extra pupils.

But Blackburn MP Jack Straw said: “I think it’s very sensible and it will have the effect of preserving the ethos and character of QEGS, whilst making the school more viable for children of families from more modest backgrounds.'
