The campaign for Catalan independence has been temporarily suspended, the regional government said today.

The halt in the official fight comes after Spain's central government filed a legal block on the vote on Tuesday.

The news came as hundreds of people gathered in Barcelona, the ‘capital’ of Catalonia, to protest at the Constitutional Court ruling, demanding the right to a referendum.

Battle: Pro-independence supporters clash with anti-riot police during a protest against suspension of planned independence vote in Barcelona, Spain

Spain's central government argues that the vote, called by Catalan leader Artur Mas for November 9th, would breach the country's rule of law because it would be held in Catalonia alone, rather than in the whole of Spain.

Last night, thousands of Catalans turned out in towns and cities across the region to protest, local media reports.

‘We just want to vote, yes or no, to know how many people are in favour and how many against,’ said Barcelona resident Isabel Redondo, who joined crowds in the Barcelona's central Sant Jaume square.

Protesters gathered in the rain outside the city’s town call, draping their umbrellas in Catalan flags and holding banners with pro-independence motifs.

Others waved giant cardboard ballot boxes as they chanted, ‘Yes, yes, yes, we will vote.’

Fight for independence: The vote on Catalan independence was set to have taken place in five weeks time, on November 9, but the campaign has now been suspended

The Constitutional Court suspended the planned referendum on Monday after the government filed its legal appeal, a move Catalan officials now want to try and overturn.

The legal suspension of Catalonia's plans had been expected for months, although Mas defied Madrid by calling the vote anyway, and is still pushing for ways for it to go ahead.

‘In the next few hours we will file our arguments to overturn the suspension of the vote,’ Francesc Homs, spokesman for the Catalan government, told reporters on Tuesday.

‘Although we have withdrawn our campaign, we are not pulling out.’

Some pro-independence campaigners want politicians to try and hold the non-binding vote in November regardless of its legality.

Together for a split: As the official campaign has been suspended, it is likely that grassroots movements will take centre stage

Hundreds of thousands of people had already filled the streets of Barcelona on September 11, the region's national day, calling for the right to vote on a potential split from Spain.

That fervour was boosted by a Scottish referendum on independence - even though it ended in a 'No' vote.

With the Catalonia referendum plans now moving into a grey area, some political analysts expect Mas to call early local elections.

A large majority of people in Catalonia, a region with its own widely spoken language and distinct culture, agree that they want to hold a referendum on independence, polls show.

And support for independence has been rising - although not to the point where it is clear that the region would vote to break away from Spain.
