Three days after being rescued from an Ebola-contaminated apartment in Dallas, Texas, Nina Pham's  dog Bentley is being monitored for the virus at a former Naval air field where animal services representatives say he is 'doing great'.

On Tuesday, the city announced they have no plans to euthanize the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, as Spanish officials did last week to a Madrid nurse's dog when she contracted the virus - sparking outrage from animal rights activists and dog-lovers on social media.

Instead, Bentley is receiving top-notch care at Hensley Field Services Center where he is checked on twice daily by  about two people, including a veterinarian, who feed him and make sure he remains healthy. 

Owner Nina Pham meanwhile, is being treated at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, and was reported in good condition on Tuesday after receiving a blood transfusion from Ebola-survivor Dr Kent Brantly.

Rescued: Ebola-patient Nina Pham's dog Bentley was taken out of her contaminated apartment on Saturday, a day after she reported to the hospital with a high fever - the first sign of the disease 

Isolated: The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is currently in a 21-day quarantine and an old Naval air field, where carers in full-hazamat clothing visit twice daily to feed the dog and check in on its condition. Above, another picture of the dog being taken out of Pham's apartment on Saturday

Dog-to-dog? Neighbors are worried that the dog may have left behind waste that could transmit the disease to their own pets. There are no documented cases of humans contracting the virus from dogs

A second nurse has since been diagnosed with the disease, as well. 

The city says Bentley is staying in a 'homelike environment' with comfortable bedding and plenty of toys to keep him entertained through the next three lonely weeks. 

Dallas Animal Services has even set up a wish list for the pup on Amazon, where members of the public can sponsor items like paper towels, a dog 'puzzle', and a ring-toss toy. 

Bentley is being treated just like a potential human patient under observation for the disease. He is being kept in isolation for 21 days, which is the maximum incubation period for the virus in human bodies. 

Animal services carers and a veterinarian in full-hazmat suiting visit Bentley twice daily to feed him and make sure he remains healthy.

Outside his holding area, hazmat barrels are stationed to collect the dog's waste. 

'Everyone who will be coming to contact with him will be in protective gear,' city spokesman Sana Syed told U.S. News and World Report. 'We’re being told to treat him like human case. We’re learning as we go.'

There's still not enough research to determine whether dogs can spread the disease, as humans do person-to-person. However, there are no documented cases of dogs spreading Ebola. The World Health Organization says Ebola outbreaks occur when humans exchange bodily fluids with animals that act as reservoirs for the disease. It's believed that fruit bats, apes, monkeys, antelopes and porcupines can hold the disease, but not dogs.

Controversial: There were protests across Spain after officials euthanized Excalibur, the dog belonging to Teresa Romero, a nurse who tested positive for the virus and is now being treated in Madrid

That uncertainly has Pham's neighbors worried however, wondering if the waste the dog left behind may lead to their own pets getting infected, and spreading the disease into the community.  

'I know she's a responsible dog owner and always picks up after her dog should something be left behind; I don't know if that's how my dog could contract Ebola,' one neighbor told KHOU. 

Bentley was taken from Pham's home on Saturday, a day after she reported to the hospital when her temperature spiked. The 26-year-old nurse from Fort Worth contracted the virus while treating Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian  who became the first man diagnosed with the disease in the U.S. Duncan died from the disease last Wednesday, after spending 11 days in the hospital.

When Pham's parents found out about her diagnoses, they pleaded with a judge to save the dog.

County Judge Clay Jenkins agreed and ordered Dallas Animal Services to take the dog into quarantine for monitoring. 

'When I met with her parents, they said: 'This dog is important to her, judge. Don't let anything happen to the dog,' Judge Jenkins told USA Today. 

'If that dog has to be The Boy In The Plastic Bubble, we're going to take good care of that dog.'

The Boy In The Plastic Bubble is a 1976 made-for-TV movie starring John Travolta, which tells the story of a boy who has to live out of an incubator because he has such a poor immune system. 

'As our brave healthcare worker told us, this dog is a significant part of her life and we vowed to her family we would do everything in our power to care for her beloved pet,' Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings in a statement. 

'I am thankful to the team who has made sure to take every precaution to protect the public health while transporting, monitoring and caring for this dog at a new, safe location. We will continue to monitor and care for this pet while following all guidance and protocols of the CDC.'
