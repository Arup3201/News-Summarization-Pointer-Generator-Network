Nurses working for the Texas Department of Health and Human Services have not received ‘a single email about any process changes’ in the wake of the Ebola outbreak. 

This is just one of the shocking claims made by Texas nurse, Jordan Dewberry, who has launched an online petition demanding that the CDC provide US health-care workers with ‘hazmat suits and decom protocol.’

Ms Dewberry’s message could not be clearer. She wrote, ‘We are NOT ready for this disease.’

In a fulsome statement posted today (Saturday) she explained, ‘I work for the Texas Department of Health and Human Services and we have not received a single email about any process changes. Nothing.’

The registered nurse continued: ‘Recently, National Nurses United – the country’s largest nursing organization – found that 76 percent of its members said their hospitals hadn’t communicated any policy about admitting Ebola patients.

‘Without the proper plan and equipment in place to keep us safe, we have a major problem.’

The petition, posted on change.org had already garnered close to 12,000 signatures – just 3,000 short of its aim - within just hours of being posted.

According to Ms Dewberry, ‘Today many nurses don’t have the most appropriate resources (fluid-resistant gowns, goggles, gloves etc). So I’m asking the Centers for Disease Control: Why is the team decontaminating the nurse’s apartment in full hazmat gear when our health care workers caring for Ebola patients are provided with less than adequate protection?’

The Center for Disease Control has come under increasing fire for its failure to contain the virus brought into the country by Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, last month.

Two of the nurses who treated Mr Duncan at Texas Presbyterian Hospital, Dallas, are now fighting for their lives having been infected by Ebola themselves.

Nurses Nina Pham, 26, and Amber Joy Vinson, 29, have now been moved to other facilities with isolation units capable of treating them. But concerns over just how sick nurse Vinson was when was given the all-clear to travel from Dallas to Cleveland and back on a bridal shopping trip continue to grow, along with grave concerns at the CDC’s handling of the crisis.

A third health-care worker who handled Mr Duncan’s lab work has now shown Ebola symptoms after being allowed to board the cruise ship currently returning to Dallas after it was turned back from the ports of Belize and Mexico.

Now, in her statement accompanying her online petition nurse Dewberry has brought fresh concerns to light and cast further doubt on the Administration, Texas State Health Department and CDC’s assertions that they are equipped to handle this crisis and have acted with ‘an abundance of caution’ at every step.

Texas Presbyterian Hospital has vigorously defended itself. In a statement issued last week the hospital pointed to the CDC’s constantly shifting guidelines as a cause of ‘frustration’ among healthcare workers struggling to abide by them.

They added that many of the stories that have emerged – including claims that waste was left to pile ‘ceiling-high’ in Mr. Duncan’s treatment room – were ‘gross exaggerations’ and claimed that the hospital’s policy of ‘non-retaliation’ rendered such anonymous reports unnecessary and unhelpful.

But Ms Dewberry is far from alone in her assertion that health-care workers are not being afforded the protection they so desperately need if the virus is to be contained and stopped in its tracks.

She said, ‘Nurses are absolutely loud on their point: they want change and they want it now.

‘It’s time we stand up and demand that the CDC provide proper protective equipment to our healthcare workers caring for a patient with Ebola.’
