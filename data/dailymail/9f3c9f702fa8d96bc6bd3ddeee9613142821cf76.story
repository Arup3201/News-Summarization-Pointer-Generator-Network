Last week, personal trainer to the stars, Louise Parker, shared the first part of her fat fighting secrets in a new blog which 
she promises will help people shape up in just a fortnight.

The 'figure magic 14' plan is one she's devised to work for her high profile clients - who include royalty to rock stars.

Now she's giving mere mortals an insight into how to can achieve her toned results by posting daily lifestyle tips, meal plans and workouts on her website.

Last Monday, the MailOnline featured the first day of the plan, and below you can see the details for days eight and nine. The remaining days of the plan can be accessed via Louise's blog.

For those who have been following the diet and exercise tips, how can they stick with it now they're half way through the 14-day regime?

Louise, 38, a mother-of-three recommends making a specific list of why you wanted to do the 'figure magic 14' in the first place.

She said: 'Is it to kickstart you into a healthier lifestyle? Is it to drop some body fat to spur you on? Is it to overhaul your eating habits positively? Is it to improve your fitness?

'Write down your reasons and and commit to them.'

She also said those struggling should remember it's only two weeks - and if you started last Monday, you're already half way there.

She said: 'Make a clear decision to commit fully to the remainder of the programme. You can do anything for two weeks. Remind yourself that it's a temporary situation and you can introduce some treats once you've hit some goals.'

But instead of indulging in fattening treats that may undo your efforts to tone up and lose weight, the London-based trainer recommends instead rewarding yourself with pampering treats instead.

She said: 'Book a massage, manicure or blow dry – anything to put a spring in your step without sabotaging your progress.'

Louise explained of her programme that the aim of it is to 'energise you, cleanse you, 
nourish you and rid your body of as much body fat as one can sensibly do
on any diet and fitness plan. If you stick to the programme for 
14 days, you will achieve results that you and others will notice.'

After the fortnight, she said people should stick to the principles as much as they can and remember that transforming lifestyle habits will take more time.

She said: 'Remember that this is a kick start – a true body transformation takes time, commitment and consistency so as you do the programme, commit to the aspects you can continue with forever.

She added: 'Keep a diet diary and note of the workouts completed so you have something to refer to once you've completed the 14-days and you can repeat it any time you need another fat burning boost.'

DAY EIGHT

Louise's lifestyle tip of the day: Staying beautifully hydrated is essential on this plan. You should be 
starting your day with a pint of warm water, mixed with juice of ½ 
lemon, before your morning caffeine fix (I allow 2 x per day). Aim for a
minimum of 2 litres of water per day and 1.5 litres of this should be 
your cranberry water (1.5 litres mixed with 30ml of cranberry 
concentrate liquid). You should be taking 2 x Psyllium Husk capsules 
before each meal, for added fibre. Don't take it with medication as it 
could absorb it. This all works together to improve lymphatic drainage 
and fat elimination from the body. Waterlogged tissues will 
dramatically improve – goodbye cankles and hello Jimmy Choo.

MEAL PLANNER

Breakfast: Vitality Smoothie. Blend together 150g of Total 0% Greek Yoghurt with ½
frozen banana, handful of frozen summer berries, handful of 
blueberries, 1 tbsp of oats and 100 – 200ml of water

Morning snack: One Braeburn apple and 12 almonds

Lunch: Sweet Lentil Salad. ¼  cup of ready cooked Merchant 
Gourmet Puy Lentils, ¼ cup of cannellini beans, 6 cherry tomatoes, 2 
spring onions, ½ red pepper, ½ yellow pepper.  Season with 1tbsp good 
balsamic vinegar, ½ tbsp. olive oil, salt and pepper

Afternoon snack: 2 sticks of celery filled with peanut butter

Supper:  Salmon parcel with spring vegetables (cook double for tomorrow's lunch box)Wrap
100g salmon fillet in foil parcel, adding 1 tbsp peas, handful spinach,
2 baby courgette, handful of mange tout.  Add 2 tbsp white wine or 
vegetable stock, salt and pepper.  Bake until tender.

Drinks: Morning: Juice of ½ lemon mixed with ½ pint of boiling water, ½ pint of cold. Drink before any other teas or coffees. You may have a total of two coffees or teas per day, made with no more than 100ml of semi skimmed milk. No fruit juices or cordials and you must drink no less than 2 litres of water per day. If you are not a fan of water, add some chopped cucumber for a refreshing drink.

Mid morning and mid afternoon: Add one tsp of cranberry powder to ½ litre of water and drink. This can be part of your two litres of water per day. Listen to your thirst and drink as much water as your body tells you. 

EXERCISE: Interval session

These reps can be done walking, jogging, running or sprinting depending on how fit you 
are. They are also be done on a bike, in a swimming pool or at the gym. The aim is to carry out the different levels of intensity for the amount of time shown (where level zero is doing nothing and level 10 is your maximum, pushing yourself as hard as you can. For this to really be effective, you have to challenge yourself out of 
your comfort zone for a very short period of time. These painful 
minutes will result in a really positive uplift in your metabolism for 
up to 24 hours after the session has finished.

Minute 5 - Level 7/10

Minute 6 - Level 8/10

Minute 19 - 20 - Take your heart rate down

Minute 20 - 30 - Level 6/10 work at a steady pace for 10 minutes and then have a stretch

DAY NINE

Louise's lifestyle tip of the day: Aim to get your workouts in before breakfast if your
primary goal is fat loss. When your glycogen levels 
(energy storage in your muscles) is low, your body has no choice but to 
dip into fat reserves to fuel your workout. The beauty of this plan is that it is low GI and low in sugars so your body should remain 
in a fat burning state most of the day. If we've just days or weeks to 
prepare a celebrity for an event, we train them hard before breakfast – 
and then maybe again in the evening. 

MEAL PLANNER

Breakfast: 2 large eggs (organic if you can), poached and served on 1 slice of good
quality wholemeal bread, served with 2 grilled tomatoes.

Morning snack: Ryvita topped with cottage cheese, salt and pepper

Lunch: Salmon parcel with spring vegetables (the extra portion you cooked last night)

Afternoon snack: 125g pot of low fat plain yoghurt (sweeten with 1tsp vanilla paste) with 2 tsp flaked almonds

Supper: Cajun Spiced Chicken Salad. Mix 1 tbsp Cajun spice mix with ½ tbsp. of
olive oil and rub on 100g of chicken breast, cut into strips.  Bake in 
oven until tender and serve with a salad of baby gem lettuce, 
3”cucumber, radish, ½ red pepper, ½ yellow pepper and 2 spring onion.  
Dress with ½ tbsp. olive oil and juice of ½ lime.

Drinks: As yesterday

EXERCISE: Hill runs

Today I would like you to do a hill run session. If you have
no hills near where you live, make a point to do a either a spinning, 
dance, power yoga or boxing class.

This is a sample of the plan, further meal options, including those for vegetarians, can be found with the rest of the 14 days at www.louiseparker.uk.com/blog.php
