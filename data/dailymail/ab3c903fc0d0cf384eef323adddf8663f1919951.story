Royal Ascot is one of the most popular events in the sporting and social calendar, with an annual attendance of nearly 300,000 people.

Dressing properly is part of the experience, at least it was until recent years when standards started to slip and spaghetti straps, mini skirts and - horror upon horrors - fascinators began showing up in the Royal Enclosure.

In a bid to reintroduce style befitting such a prestigious event the bosses at Ascot introduced stricter dress code regulations in 2012 for certain parts of the course, employing a fleet of well-dressed fashion police to enforce the rules.

Naturally, the dress code assistants' own outfits will be under strict scrutiny and today model Amber le Bon unveiled the chic new designs that will be worn by the women policing the racegoers outfits.

The silver shift dresses and matching jackets are designed by high-end High Street brand Hobbs and they adhere to the rule banning strapless or spaghetti straps, and that ladies hems must be of 'modest length'.

The jacket is finished with a slim bow belt and the outfits at today's photocall were completed with nude heels and elaborate yet elegant hats that organisers hope will set the tone for the event.

The specially trained team of Dress Code Assistants was first introduced in 2012.

Available outside the racecourse to help
 visitors with any last minute concerns over their attire the women also
 manned the ticket stiles to make sure that nobody wearing the wrong 
sort of clothing entered the stands without first being made over in 
accordance with the new rules.

The assistants will be wearing the grey outfits, designed by Hobbs, and be outside Ascot to offer advice and provide minor corrections if necessary as they did last year

Model Amber seemed to be enjoying the day, which saw photographers and crowds gather to catch the first glimpse of the Dress Code Assistant's outfits

Alongside a brochure detailing the dressing-up dos and don'ts of the sporting festival, Ascot organisers have launched a video to remind racegoers how long dresses ought to hang and what sort of top hats gentlemen should be wearing.

They claim that this is is to keep the ancient tradition of the annual race alive and to make sure the atmosphere remains the same.

At the heart of Royal Ascot is the 
Royal Enclosure which, like the tradition of the Royal Procession, dates
 back to the early 1800’s and the reign of George IV. Within this area, a
 strict dress code of morning dress for men and formal day wear for 
ladies applies, including no fascinators or thighs on display.

Guests
 in the Grandstand Admission are required to wear smart dress with gentlemen required to wear a shirt
 and tie and ladies a hat or fascinator. No branded clothing or strapless outfits are allowed.

And
 the final admission area, the Silver Ring is the least formal enclosure
 with no applicable dress code, designed for those people looking for a 
more relaxed day out.

Charles Barnett, Chief Executive at 
Ascot Racecourse said: ‘We were delighted with the reception of the new 
dress code last year, which endorsed our decision to make such changes. 
Royal Ascot is an event where people like to dress up and they feel a 
bit let down when those around them don’t.

'The
 Dress Code Assistants were a tremendous addition to the customer 
welcome last year, providing advice and where necessary minor 
corrections. Once again Hobbs London will be providing their outfits, so
 that they are beautifully presented at the entrances and easily 
identifiable.’

Sandy
 Verdon, Creative Director at Hobbs added: ‘We are proud to once again 
support Ascot with the outfits for the Dress Code Assistants.  Royal 
Ascot is such a special event and everyone enjoys dressing up for the 
occasion.  The bespoke outfit is perfect for the Assistants as they are 
modern, elegant and all in keeping with the unique dress code.’
