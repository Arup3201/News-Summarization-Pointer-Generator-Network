Passing on his experience: Martinez gives a practical demonstration to some of Wales' up-and-coming players

Martinez, 
who guided the Toffees to fifth in the Premier League table as Everton 
qualified for Europe in his first season in charge, was a guest speaker 
at the event and also gave a practical demonstration to some of the 
countrie's up-and-coming players.

The 
Spaniard spent two years managing in Wales after he took over the 
managerial reigns at Swansea back in 2007 before leaving for Wigan two years later - Martinez also spent three years as a player with the club.

The 40-year-old will be spending the rest of the summer looking to recruit players as Everton plan to gatecrash the top four having narrowly missed out last term.
