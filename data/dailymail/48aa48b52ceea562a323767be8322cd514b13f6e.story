A white-collar Manhattan lawyer plunged to his death on Friday night, jumping from his luxury Central Park West apartment and landing in a tree.

Fell to his death: Corporate lawyer Stephen R. Hertz is believed to have committed suicide Friday night

Stephen R. Hertz - a partner at Midtown law firm Debevoise & Plimpton, where he specialized in venture capitalism, mergers and acquisitions - was found about 9.20pm after diving from his 22nd-floor window.

The 55-year-old was discovered by a building manager, with the tree in which he landed needing to be cut down in order to retrieve his body.

According to The New York Post, Hertz sent a suicide note to his ex-wife, who forward it to a psychiatrist, who then called 911.

Hertz was pronounced dead at the scene near 105th st, behind the New York Cancer Hospital.

His death follows the similar suicide of another lawyer, Leonard Morton, 45, who jumped to his death from the 12th floor window of his office recently.

Morton, who represented the likes of 
Madison Square Garden and The Lincoln Center, landed face down on scaffolding above the sidewalk on 
Broadway near Barclay Street at about 7.20am on March 7, with morning commuters seeing his body.

Morton was said to be going through a 'terrible, terrible depression' following the death of his parents.

Also suffering bi-polar, he had recently separated from his wife.
