Chelsea are on the brink of sealing the £32million capture of Diego Costa.

MailOnline revealed on Tuesday how the Spain forward was set to have a medical after recovering from the hamstring problem that blighted the final weeks of his season with Atletico Madrid.

That took place in Barcelona on Wednesday and the striker is poised to be confirmed as a Chelsea player before the World Cup after passing his checks.

The west London club met Costa’s release clause and agreed terms understood to be around £150,000-per-week.

The
 star striker would be Jose Mourinho’s first summer signing and the 
Chelsea boss is keen to sign another forward, with Bayern Munich’s Mario
 Mandzukic among his list of targets.

Mourinho is also hopeful of raiding Atletico for left back Filipe Luis and midfielder Tiago.

Thibaut Courtois looks like returning from Atletico, after Mourinho told the goalkeeper he wants him at Chelsea.

The
 Belgian, 22, would be returning after three seasons on loan in Madrid, where he has established himself as one of Europe’s best 
keepers.

There is a feeling among some members of 
the Blues hierarchy that Courtois would benefit from another 12 months 
at Atletico before returning to Stamford Bridge for the 2015-16 season.

Courtois would be happy to do that but instead he is set to return and challenge Petr Cech, 32, for a starting place.
