On road to freedom: Russia's former richest man Mikhail Khodorkovsky is set to be pardoned by Vladimir Putin after ten years in jail

President Vladimir Putin says he will pardon one of his best-known opponents, the jailed oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky.

Putin made the announcement that he would soon free Khodorkovsky, once Russia's richest man, after a marathon news conference in which he exuded confidence that he has reasserted his authority in the face of street protests.

He also confirmed that women from the Pussy Riot group would be also be released.

But he remained firm on Russia's response to a Greenpeace protest over Arctic oil drilling which he said should serve as a lesson even though all charges against them look set to be dropped under a new amnesty bill.

He insisted that Moscow would toughen steps to guard against interference in its development of the region.

Khodorkovsky, 50, spectacularly fell 
out with Putin a decade ago and had his Yukos oil company dissolved 
following his arrest on fraud and tax evasion charges in 2003.

He
 became Putin's nemesis, a symbol of what investors say is the Kremlin's
 abuse of the courts for political ends - and share prices rose in 
Moscow on the news he would be pardoned.

Putin
 has long singled out Khodorkovsky, who would be due for release in 
August, for bitter personal attacks, once saying that 'a thief should 
sit in jail'.

On Thursday, he said: 'He has been in jail already more than 10 years. This is a serious punishment.'

Saying
 that Khodorkovsky's mother was ill, he added: 'I decided that, with 
these circumstances in mind, we should make a decision to pardon him.'

Russian stocks rose by 1.3 per cent after Putin's comment, even though his lawyers and mother said he had not asked for a pardon.

One of the lawyers said, however, that Putin did not need a pardon request to release him from prison.

Sympathetic: Russian President Vladimir Putin discusses his decision to pardon his political nemesis in part because of his mother's ill health - a move which caused share prices to rise

Vladimir Putin today made the controversial claim that there was no difference between 'dictators' Josef Stalin and Oliver Cromwell.

The Kremlin leader was commenting on plans to restore statues of the Soviet tyrant and other Communist leaders more than two decades after they were toppled.  

One contentious plan backed by Russian hardliners would see monuments to Stalin and the feared founder of the Soviet secret services Felix Dzerzhinsky brought back in Moscow, moves which Putin likened to the monument to Cromwell outside the Houses of Parliament.

'How in particular is Cromwell so different from Stalin? Can you tell me? Not in any way at all,' he said.  

'From the point of view of liberals, he is the same bloody dictator.' 

Of Cromwell - a soldier and statesman who signed Charles I's death warrant before becoming England's Protector  - he said: 'He was quite a treacherous dude, one has to say.'

Investors had long seen the treatment of a man who built a business empire on the ruins of Soviet communism as evidence of the weakness of property rights and the rule of law in Russia.

Supporters say Khodorkovsky was jailed to curb a political challenge to Putin, bring his oil assets under state control and send a signal to other wealthy 'oligarchs' to toe the line. His assets were sold off, mainly into state hands.

In the eyes of Kremlin critics at home and abroad, Khodorkovsky's jailing is one of the biggest stains on the record of Putin, who was first elected president in 2000 and has not ruled out seeking another six-year term in 2018.

Khodorkovsky's mother, Marina, who will turn 80 next year, said she had just heard the reports and was unaware of a request for a pardon.

'I want to believe he will pardon him,' she told Reuters. 'I want to believe Putin is not totally lost.'

Khodorkovsky is due for release in August.

But
 he has previously had his jail term extended on other charges and 
analysts have said Putin would allow Khodorkovsky to walk free only if 
he no longer regarded him as a political threat.

Freeing Khodorkovsky and the two women 
from Pussy Riot, jailed over a profanity-laced protest against Putin in a
 Russian Orthodox Church, could ease criticism of the president before 
the Sochi Olympics in February.

He has staked a great deal of personal prestige on the Games, and is under fire over a law banning the spread of 'anti-gay propaganda' among minors.

Meanwhile, Putin suggested Greenpeace 
activists detained for a protest at a drilling platform operated by 
state-controlled Gazprom in September may have been carrying out an 
order to undermine Russia's development of Arctic energy resources.

'Why
 was this (protest) carried out? Either it was to put pressure on a 
company or on someone's orders interfere with Russia's offshore 
development,' Putin said, suggesting foreign rivals could have been 
behind it but naming no nation.

'This is a serious thing for us. And we do not plan to soften (our stance), we will only be toughening it.'

New law: British Greenpeace activist Alexandra Harris, from Exeter, pictured in court in Saint Petersburg, may finally be able to return home after a new law could see her charges for hooliganism dropped

Released: Anthony Perrett, from Newport in South Wales, was arrested by Russian authorities during a Greenpeace protest in the Arctic - he was freed on bail after spending two months in detention

Russia's treatment of the 30 activists from 18 countries, has drawn criticism from Western nations and a number of global celebrities.

The 30 were held in custody for two months and face up to seven years in prison if tried and convicted.

Speaking at an annual news conference, Putin said an amnesty passed this week that lawyers say will enable the Greenpeace activists to avoid trial and return home was not drafted with them in mind.

'As for the fact that they can now get amnesty... we are not doing this for them,' Putin said.

'What happened must be a lesson and should, I hope, dispose us, with Greenpeace, to working positively together.'
