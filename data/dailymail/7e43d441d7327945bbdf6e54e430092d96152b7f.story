Michael Le Vell could be back on Coronation Street in months with a new £250,000-a-year deal ready to be signed, it emerged today.

ITV sources have said that scriptwriters are already plotting a dramatic Christmas return for the star, who has played Kevin Webster for 30 years.

To explain his absence while the actor prepared for his child rape trial, his mechanic character was flown to Germany to care for his unwell father.

Publicly the soap stalwart, 48, has said he 
'might have a holiday' before any possible return to the show, but 
privately he is said to be excited about a return to 'the best job in 
the world'.

Return: Michael Le Vell is set to sign a £250,000 a year deal and will likely return for Christmas

Cleared: The actor (pictured with his sister Sue outside Manchester Crown Court) is poised for a return to the show after he was cleared of 12 sex abuse charges

Corrie executives were among the 
first people Mr Le Vell thanked for their 'support' after he was 
acquitted in just five hours yesterday.

Minutes later an ITV spokesman said: 'We are looking forward to meeting 
with Michael to discuss his return to the programme,' and privately they have already promised him the best storylines when he is back. 

Yesterday Le Vell said he was 'delighted' and it was a 'big weight off everyone's shoulders' after he was cleared of the charges at Manchester Crown Court.

The actor had maintained his innocence throughout and was acquitted of 12 child sex offences.

Asked when he would return to Coronation Street, Le Vell replied: 'I don't know, I might have a holiday first. I'll have to go and have a chat with my boss.'

Bosses at the channel have also been unable to provide a timetable for any possible return to the show.

They just said thet 
are 'looking forward' to planning the actor's return after he was found 
not guilty of raping and sexually assaulting a girl from the age of six.

Actor: Le Vell (pictured on Coronation Street in 2008) has been on the show for 30 years and is now set to return after he was cleared today

Famous: After three years in the soap, Kevin 
Webster married wife Sally in 1986 (left) and their at times stormy 
marriage and family life has captured the country's imagination 
for decades

He first joined Coronation Street in 
1983 and quickly endeared himself to fans, who have followed the trials 
and tribulations of Kevin, from Brian Tilsley's apprentice mechanic 
through to his stormy marriage to Sally, played by Sally Dynevor.

Although
the actor has not filmed any scenes for the ITV soap since he was 
charged earlier this year, he has not been officially suspended as 
bosses were reportedly waiting on the outcome of the trial.

Le Vell pledged to carry on playing Kevin Webster because he still viewed it as 'the best job on television'.

It was reported that he would be offered a new £250,000 contract to stay with the ITV soap if he was cleared.
