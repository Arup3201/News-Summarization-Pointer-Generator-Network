President Obama's beleaguered health care programme has received a ringing endorsement - from Nevada's legal prostitutes.

The controversial scheme - otherwise known as Obamacare - is accused of being too expensive by some critics and faced anger after crippling glitches on its website prevented many from signing up when it first launched.

But the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has enabled the legal prostitutes to get health insurance cover for the first time.

High price: Dennis Hof, owner of the Moonlight Bunny Ranch, center, says Obamacare is good for the legal prostitutes working in his brothel, but will cost him a fortune in extra tax

'Having this profession, we aren't 
exactly offered group health insurance... I'm excited,' Taylor Lee, who 
works at Moonlight Bunny Ranch, told Nevada's news4.

Ms Lee said she had repeatedly refused health cover prior to Barack Obama signing the statute.

Nevada is the only state in America where, under certain strict circumstances, prostitution is legal.

Risk: U.S. President Barack Obama has staked his political legacy on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare

But despite working within the tightly 
controlled and regulated brothels, many of the women found they were 
nonetheless shunned by health insurers, until now.

Caressa
Kisses told news4: 'They equate us to illegal working girls who have very 
high STD's and AIDS rates which we have none of the above. We're legal, 
licensed prostitutes.

She added: 'We're independent contractors. We have to get our own insurance but this is truly a blessing.'

'Blessing: Nevada's legal prostitutes say Obamacare, which extends health insurance to millions of Americans previously shunned by the health care industry, is a 'blessing'

But to pay for the extension of health 
insurance, the Affordable Care Act includes new taxes on high-earners, 
the healthcare industry and large businesses - including the brothel's owner.

Dennis
Hof claims the new healthcare system will cost him, as an owner of 
seven separate brothels - all employing about 15 people each -  a strip club, restaurants and a truck stop, across the state, a fortune.

He told news4: 'I'm the sole stockholder but because I'm the owner for all these different businesses, they lump them together.

'What
am I going to do? I'm either going to have to spend a lot of money on 
health insurance because the rates are going up or I'm going to have to 
face severe penalties, so I'm really perplexed about all of this.'

Criticism: Obama's Affordable Care Act has been slammed after the signup page on the HealthCare.gov kept crashing after it was launched

The Bunny Ranch, in Carson City, Nevada, is America's most famous brothel and featured on Oprah Winfrey's chat show.

Working girl Brooke Taylor gave the crew a guided tour of the ranch where punters can legally pay for sex - including its on-site sexual health clinic.

The blonde took the cameras inside the room where the 500 girls who are licensed to work at the ranch are tested for sexually transmitted diseases every week and HIV once a month.

Obamacare has antagonised many Republicans and those on the Right because it is seen as too much state interference, extremely expensive and inefficient.

While lower-income people could see lower costs because of government
subsidies, many in the middle class risk a rude awakenings when they 
access the websites to discover they may have toÂ  pay significantly more.

But many have welcomed the changes as the first time millions of Americans will have access to health care insurance.
