Montanans looking to save on their Thanksgiving meal this year need look no further than the side of the freeway.

That's because the state passed a law on Tuesday making it legal for residents to eat roadkill.

Predators, birds and sheep are the only animals not allowed to be salvaged, so turkey's not an option. But certainly you could make due with one of the 4,754 whitetail deer killed a year in the state?

All you have to do is fill out a permit within 24 hours of salvaging the roadkill.

What's for dinner? On Tuesday, it became legal in Montana to salvage and consume certain kinds of roadkill

Now OK to eat:

4,754 Whitetail deer1,977 Mule deer220 Elk72 Antelope28 Moose

Still off-limits:

39 Black bears5 Grizzly bears6 Mountain lions15 Bighorn sheep

'Any peace officer in the state of Montana can issue a vehicle-killed wildlife salvaged permit. The Montana Highway Patrol is capable of actually printing the permits in their vehicles, we can issue the permits on the side of the road,' MHP Patrol Sergeant Jay Nelson told MTN News.

If a police officer isn't present, Montanans can alternately fill out a form online.

There are some rules that govern how the animals can be used, however.

Road kill can only be used for one's own consumption and must not be donated, used as bait or pet food.

You also must clear the road fully of all parts of the animal.

Any animal still alive when found on the side of the road can only be killed if it's in season and the person has a valid hunting license.

Anyone found taking roadkill without filling out the proper paperwork can be ticketed for illegal possession.

Authorities warn citizens to be careful what they choose to eat off the side of the road.

No turkey: Some kinds of roadkill are still illegal to eat including predators, birds of prey and sheep

'We assume no liability whatsoever for the quality of the meat,' Mike Korn, assistant chief of law enforcement for the state Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks, told WTKR. 'The conditions of the permit say you take full responsibility for the quality of the meat you salvage.'

But many believe this new regulation will help feed many hungry Montanans. 

'We have people that are hungry here in this country. This is a good way to supplement your food. Some of that meat's good. Yeah, some of it will be bad if it's been hit hard; but overall I think it's a wonderful program,' Jefferson City resident Don Balser said.

Some 17 other states have codes regulating roadkill possession and consumption.
