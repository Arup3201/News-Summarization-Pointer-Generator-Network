Vincent Enyeama is adamant that the Africa Cup of Nations should not go ahead due to the threat  of the deadly Ebola epidemic spreading.

The Nigeria and Lille keeper was forthright in his assessment of the situation and pleaded with the Confederation of African Football (CAF) to cancel the tournament in Morocco. 

Speaking after his club side drew 0-0 with Everton in the Europa League on Thursday, the 32-year-old stopper said: 'I really wish it doesn't happen with all the people that will be moving around.

'But I'm not CAF. I'm not the one who calls the shots.'

Enyeama confirmed that he was fearful of the spread of the Ebola virus, which has killed almost 5,000 people across west Africa, and added: 'It's risky for everyone because you go to Africa and then everyone is hugging you and shaking you, and what can you do? You're at risk.

'But if it happens I will play, if we qualify.'

Nigeria are currently third in Group A in their qualification pool for the tournament - only the top two and the best third-placed teams will make the tournament.
