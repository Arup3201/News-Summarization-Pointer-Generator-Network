The Obama administration announced today that it will extend indefinitely the review period for the remaining portion of the Keystone pipeline.

The State Department did not give an end date for the review process, discouraging proponents of the project who had hoped the government would make its decision in the next few weeks.

President Barack Obama previously announced his administration's support for the third phase of the Keystone pipeline earlier this year, but said his administration would put the fourth and final phase through another review process

'The permit process will conclude once factors that have a significant 
impact on determining the national interest of the proposed project have
 been evaluated and appropriately reflected in the decision documents,' the department's statement said.

'The Department 
will give the agencies sufficient time to submit their views.'

State spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a tweet that the department needed more time to review the more than 2.5 million comments it had received. Therefore state was adding more time to the review process but not the public comment period.

She also cited an ongoing court case in Nebraska as a reason for the delay. The case, which is under review by the Nebraska Supreme Court, could affect the route of the yet-to-be built  Keystone XL pipeline.

Three sections of the Keystone pipeline have already been completed or are under construction. The fourth and final phase of the pipeline, Keystone XL, is awaiting government approval. Phase IV would stretch from Alberta, Canada to Steele City, Nebraska.

Two years ago President Obama denied TransCanada Corporation's application to build the pipeline in response to concerns from environmental groups. After the company altered the route, Nebraska Governor Dave Heineman gave the final phase the green light in January 2013.

The Obama administration has been slow to do the same, instead opting to put the application through a formal review process that was scheduled to end in May.

Leading opponent of the pipeline, the Natural Resources Defense Council, praised the administration's decision immediately following Friday's announcement.

'Getting this decision right includes
being able to evaluate the yet-to-be determined route through Nebraska and
continuing to listen to the many voices that have raised concerns about
Keystone XL,' the organization said in a statement.

Meanwhile, House Speaker John Boehner blasted the delay as a 'refusal to stand up to the extreme left.''This  delay is shameful,' Boehner said in a press release.' This job-creating project has  cleared every environmental hurdle 
and overwhelmingly passed the test of  public opinion, yet it’s been 
blocked for more than 2,000 days.'

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's statement echoed Boehner's.

The pipeline is projected to create thousands of jobs. The exact number is unknown but average ranges are in the thousands.

Support for the pipeline is bipartisan. After TransCanada changed it's proposed route for Keystone XL, former President Bill Clinton said the country should 'embrace' the pipeline.

After the Obama administration's announcement Friday afternoon, Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp called the delay 'ridiculous.'

'This most recent delay leaves everyone waiting in limbo – federal 
agencies, construction and energy workers and companies, state 
officials, and Canada.  It hurts all of us when no decisions are made,' she said in a statement.

The freshman Senator is part of a group of 11 Democratic senators publicly pressuring the President to make a decision one way or the other by the end of next month. Heitkamp said that given today's news she would be 
forced to 'seriously consider other available options for approval.'
