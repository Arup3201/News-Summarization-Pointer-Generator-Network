A police expert who is trained in identifying suspected criminals from CCTV believes he may have found the soldier behind one of the most famous photographs of the First World War.  

Last week, Raymond Darkes claimed that his father Frederick was the man captured on camera carrying a wounded comrade through the trenches during the Battle of the Somme in 1916.  

However, Scotland Yard 'super-recogniser' PC Dale Nufer has ruled Pte Darkes out of the running, saying he cannot be the person from the propaganda film.  

Instead, he pointed to Pte George Edwin Raine as a possible candidate, as there is a 'link and a resemblance' between photographs of him and the famous image from the Somme.  

Mystery: The soldier in this image, taken from The Battle of the Somme, has never been identified 

Found? Douglas Raine believes the soldier was his father, Pte George Edwin Raine, pictured in this photograph

The picture was taken from The Battle of the Somme, a film which helped educate the British public to the horrors of the trenches at a time when many had a much more positive image of the war.  

It shows a soldier looking up at the camera with a haunted look, carrying a wounded man who is said to have died half an hour after the footage was captured.  

However, the film's producers did not keep a record of who appeared in it, leading to decades of speculation about the soldier's identity.  

Last week Mr Darkes, 83, said he had no doubt that the man must have been his father, who survived the trenches and lived until 1960. 

Claim: Last week the son of Frederick Darkes, pictured with his wife, said he thought he was the soldier

But Mr Nufer, one of the Metropolitan Police's most skilled identification experts, told The Times it was almost impossible that the two men were the same person.  

'His nose is a lot longer and sharper and the eyes seem different,' he said. 'The soldier has a full ear lobe and [Darkes] doesn't - he has a squarer chin and slightly higher forehead.'  

Solution? PC Dale Nufer, pictured, says Pte Darkes cannot have been the soldier and suggests it is more likely to have been Pte  Raine

Douglas Raine, 83, from West Sussex, insists that the man was in fact his father George, who served with the Durham Light Infantry.  

The former soldier apparently remembered being caught on camera while carrying his comrade towards the nearest medical station.  

When Mr Nufer saw a photograph of Pte Raine, he said: 'There is more of a link and a resemblance, if you look at the straight brow, the stronger and broader nose and the solid-looking, oval shape of the face.  

'And he has the right kind of ear lobe. I would say there is a link with this one.'  

Pte Raine was a miner from County Durham, before moving to London to work on building the Underground.  

During the war he used his mining experience to help dig military tunnels, and he died in 1960 at the age of 76. 

The Imperial War Museum, which owns the propaganda film, says the question of identification is 'officially open' and has declined to comment on the competing claims. 

Mr Nufer has identified more than 200 criminals from examining CCTV footage of crime scenes.  

He is part of a team of Met 'super-recognisers' who have been picked out as exceptionally talented at spotting people and matching up identifications.  

The specialist officers are often used to provide the initial breakthrough in a case, which will then be investigated using conventional means to corroborate the identification of the suspect. 

The Battle of the Somme was shown around Britain just four weeks after it was filmed on the battlefield.

It was a huge success, and 20million people had flocked to cinemas to see the footage just six weeks after it was released. A single film would not reach so many viewers again until Star Wars in 1977. 

Photographs and descriptions of life on the front had been available previously, but this was the first time a moving picture of modern warfare was widely shown. Many audience members would never have seen a film before. 

At first was feared that the graphic depiction of war might damage morale, but instead the images of brave British soldiers struggling on the front line brought about a huge swell of support. 

A newspaper report at the time said: 'Crowded audiences ... were interested and thrilled to have the realities of war brought so vividly before them, and if women had sometimes to shut their eyes to escape for a moment from the tragedy of the toll of battle which the film presents, opinion seems to be general that it was wise that the people at home should have this glimpse of what our soldiers are doing and daring and suffering in Picardy.'
