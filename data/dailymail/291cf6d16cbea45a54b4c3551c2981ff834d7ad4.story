England have retained the Ashes after rain ensured the third test against Australia ended in a draw at Emirates Old Trafford.

Alastair Cook became an Ashes-winning captain for the first time in anti-climactic circumstances after the Manchester weather spared his side a final-day battle to avoid a defeat that would have kept the series alive.

The tourists were in a commanding position, having removed Alastair Cook, Jonathan Trott and Kevin Pietersen to reduce England to 37-3 in pursuit of an unlikely target of 332.

Australia were given a glimmer of hope when play started at 11.30am - against all forecasted predictions - and they reduced a nervy England to 37 for three in 20.3 overs.

Joy: England players celebrate on the balcony after retaining the Ashes

Dull: Just 20.3 overs were possible on the final day as rain halted Australia's victory charge

Anger: Kevin Pietersen walks off in rage after being dismissed on the final day at Old Trafford

Informative: The big screen at Old Trafford confirms the news that England retained the Ashes

Delight: Graeme Swann enjoyed England's Ashes win on Twitter

Flying start: After Australia declared on 172 for seven, Ryan Harris dismissed Alastair Cook for a duck

Baffling: Cook reviewed the decision, but Hawk-Eye showed the ball to be crashing into middle stump

Plumb: Hawk-eye shows Cook's lbw dismissal to Harris in the third over

And another: Harris struck again moments late to dismiss Jonathan Trott and leave England reeling

But the expected rain eventually 
settled in before umpires Marais Erasmus and Tony Hill officially 
abandoned the match at 4.39pm to secure England a third successive Ashes success for the first time 
since 1981.

The result gave England a 2-0 lead with two Tests to play in the five-match series and ensures they will keep hold of the urn, as they triumphed in the past two series.

British Prime Minister David Cameron took to Twitter to comment on the historic win.

He said: 'And to think some people criticise the British weather. Congratulations to our cricketers on retaining the #Ashes.'

England players also hit social media to voice their delight. Graeme Swann said: 'Many times I have cursed the rain in Manchester, but today I would take it home to meet my grandma and marry it.'

Gone: Kevin Pietersen was next to go after edging behind to Haddin as England reached lunch at 35 for three

Debate: Pietersen reviewed the decision and Hot Spot showed no mark on his bat

Evidence: The original decision was upheld and Snicko appeared to show a faint edge

Outraged: Pietersen was far from happy as he left the field following his dismissal

Kevin Pietersen said: 'Wow! What a feeling', while Stuart Broad tweeted: 'We have retained the Ashes and it feels magnificent!!!'

England had to survive a brief scare, though, after their top order was dismissed in the 90 minutes of play before lunch.

Cook was trapped lbw without scoring 
before Jonathan Trott and Kevin Pietersen followed him back to the 
pavilion after offering catches to wicketkeeper Brad Haddin.

The weather then started to close in, 
and after just three balls of the afternoon session, the rain forced the
players off for good at 2pm.

For Australia the draw, which ended a 
run of six Test defeats, meant their earliest concession of the Ashes in
a series since 1929.

'It's a bit of a strange day. Today we had a little bit of luck and it's nice to retain the Ashes,' said England captain Alastair Cook at an indoor presentation.

'The feeling in the dressing room is a very pleasant one. Now we want to go on and win it (the series).'

The teams next face each other at Chester-le-Street in Durham from Friday for the fourth test which will be a slight anti-climax after the literal damp-squib finish at Old Trafford.

England will still want to win the Ashes outright for the third straight time while Australia will at least look to make it 2-2 and head home with some confidence for the next series between the two starting in November.

'It's unfortunate. I certainly don't want to take anything away from England. It's the chance you take going 2-0 down," Australia skipper Michael Clarke said of the weather.

'Our goal is to try to level the series.'
