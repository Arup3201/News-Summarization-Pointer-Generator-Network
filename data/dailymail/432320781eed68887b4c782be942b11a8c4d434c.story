He's been accused of making many a fashion faux pas while on holiday.

But the Prime Minister seems to be deaf to his critics. Yesterday David Cameron was seen in the same pair of beige loafers he wore on holiday last year.    

Mr Cameron, who is in Lanzarote with his family, got  the £20.99 shoes from high street store Aldo and took them with him to Portugal last summer. 

Retread: David Cameron with Samantha yesterday. And yes - he's wearing the same shoes

David Cameron and Samantha in Portugal last year - where he debuted his beige loafers

Yesterday he teamed them with a casual
 navy blue shirt and beige shorts on a trip to Teguise in the centre of 
the island with wife Samantha.

As
 ever fashion consultant Mrs Cameron trumped her husband in the style 
stakes, wearing an elegant black maxi dress and emerald green cardigan.

The
 couple and their children Nancy, Arthur and Florence are spending six 
days on the island in a £200-a-night restored 18th century farmhouse, 
away from the main resorts.

The Prime Minister sported no socks with smart black work shoes in one memorable holiday look

The couple wear matching trainers while on holiday in Granada, Spain, in 2011

The
 retreat has been styled with an Indonesian theme.

It includes 
carved Buddha statues, has its own yoga hall, swimming pool, hot tub  
and ‘chill-out’ area with hammocks – ideal for a Prime  Minister who 
reputedly has a taste for ‘chillaxing’.

Mr
 Cameron has previously been ridiculed for his holiday attire, such as 
wearing smart black work shoes without socks and garish floral shorts.
