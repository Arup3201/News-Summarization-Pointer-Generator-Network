In a recent opinion piece published in Uganda's New Vision newspaper, president Yower Museveni argued that the country's Tourism Promotion Board does little to market the country properly.

According to Museveni, the east African nation is a 'better destination' than Spain for holidaymakers, but because of poor promotion, visitors are simply unaware.

The tourism board, he writes, only promotes Uganda as having 'some chimpanzees and so on.'

'The biggest problem with tourism is poor promotion,' the president (pictured) wrote in his opinion piece

In his piece, Museveni even goes so far as to say that Uganda's Tourism Board should be renamed the 'tourism suppression board'.

'The biggest problem with tourism is poor promotion,' he wrote. 'In Europe, people go to the Mediterranean coast.

'I visited Spain, it is very hot and humid in the summer.

'I think Uganda would be a better destination than some of those destinations.'

According to Museveni, Spain is too hot and humid in the summer - and Uganda would be a much better

He further argued that Uganda was 'a good place on globe where you go and have a nice life'.

'We are right on the Equator but because of the high altitude, we have snow-capped mountains, but even when there is no snow, the climate is very mild - very good for the human beings.'

Earlier in November, Museveni made similar remarks while opening the 39th World Congress of the African Travel Association. 

During the conference, the president called many parts of Africa - such as its tropical forests, lakes, rivers and snow-capped mountains - miracles and, as such, great tourist attractions.

He also called upon tourists to take advantage of Africa's beautiful climate. 

'The climate is very mild,' he insists. 'Very good for human beings.' Pictured: Kidepo Valley National Park

Though the president also insisted that peace is prevailing in most part of Africa, and that 'pockets' of conflict and strange diseases cannot severely affect the tourism industry, The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all travel to the region of north eastern Uganda with the exception of trips to Kidepo Valley National Park. 

Visitors are warned about the  high threat from terrorism in the country, however, it seems that the Ebola outbreak has been confined to the other side of the continent.

Three specific cases of the outbreak have been contained by the country and Uganda has likewise contained two outbreaks of the Marbug virus, which the president also highlighted in his opinion piece.
