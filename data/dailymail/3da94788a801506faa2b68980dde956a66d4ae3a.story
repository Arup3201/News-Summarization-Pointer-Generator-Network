I was filling the camper van with petrol at 3.30am in Salome, Arizona, and couldn't help but notice the large man with an out-of-control orange beard walking towards me.

'Could you tell me when Pippa's passing this way?' he asked.

The Pippa in question was Pippa Middleton, who, with her brother James were members of an eight-person team participating in the 2014 Race Across America (RAAM) cycle race.

Wide open spaces: America - with landmarks such as the Grand Canyon - is a wonderful country for cycling

I was a member of a team in the same event, so I had the answer - but not the one he was looking for. He'd missed her: Pippa and her crew were slightly quicker than us, and a few hours ahead.

The news disappointed my bearded friend.

RAAM is regarded as one of the toughest cycle races in the world, with competitors starting on the West Coast in Oceanside, California, and finishing 3,020 miles and a total of 170,000ft of climbing later in Annapolis, Maryland, on the East Coast.

Once the clock starts, it doesn't stop until the team cross the finishing line. 

For solo riders, this means an average of 90 minutes' sleep every 24 hours during the seven to 11 days they are on the road.

When I say I was part of a team, I must confess that I wasn't actually taking part.

I was a member of the 13-strong back-up crew required to make sure our four riders, all raising money for Asthma UK, travelled across the US as quickly and safely as possible, and we did it in seven days, nine hours and 42 minutes.

The race is in its 34th year and attracts somewhere in the region of 350 riders and more than 1,000 support crew who handle all the logistics - including food, fluids, navigation, laundry, medical needs and bike repairs, so that all the riders have to do is race.

It was a major life experience for all our riders. None had experienced sleep deprivation on this scale.

Crew tended to get a couple of hours' sleep every 14 hours or so, with riders slightly more.

For the first 24 hours everyone runs on adrenaline, the next 24 are tough but bearable, but by day three you can see only what other crew members aren't doing and fail to recognise anything they actually do.

It was on the third day of the event that we actually saw crew members from another team wrestling each other by the side of the road. And we heard of another team who'd been forced to hire an additional back-up vehicle as two of their crew could no longer share the same space.

This thing is tough.

However, after day three the body becomes more used to the lack of sleep and some form of 'status quo' returns. Although there were more dark moments along the way, I can no longer recall them and it's the highlights that will live with me for ever.

An A-list attraction: Passing through Monument Valley (in Arizona and Utah) was one of David's highlights

From a scenic point of view, the route is stunning. A few personal recollections in chronological order:

*The 4,000ft descent from the San Diego mountains via 'The Glass Elevator' - the road into the Mojave Desert, 170ft below sea level with temperatures in excess of 110F.

* The stunning Monument Valley, characterised by clusters of vast iconic red sandstone buttes.

* Riding at 10,000ft over the snow-capped Rockies.

* The arrow-straight roads disappearing into the horizon across the High Plains of Kansas.

* The Mississippi River and the beautiful, densely wooded Appalachians.

* The famous Civil War battlefield at Gettysburg in Pennsylvania.

We arrived at the Atlantic Ocean in Annapolis shattered but with the most amazing sense of achievement, and a bond between a group of individuals that will last for ever.

The logistics of getting a team of four cyclists non-stop to the end of a 3,000-mile race are complicated. As a crew, we planned for several months prior to the race while the riders trained.

We decided to operate two crews and work in seven-hour shifts. Each shift would see two riders alternating on the road, usually doing a half-hour stint each before swapping.

At the end of seven hours, they'd be replaced by the two riders who had been resting. On the road behind each pair of riders there was a driver, a navigator and a nutritionist, who ensured that the riders were topped up with fluids and food.

Just another 2,000-ish miles ago: A member of David's team keeps the pedals turning across America

In the Mojave Desert, one of our riders consumed more than six litres of fluid during his seven-hour shift and still managed to lose some 4lb in weight. Supporting these people were the guys and girls in the motorhome, who made sure that a hearty meal was prepared for the riders coming on to shift and something even more substantial for those coming off.

They also took care of laundry, food shopping, the constant supply of ice, blogging, updating our website, and any other unforeseen requirements thrown at them.

The motorhome was also the communications hub, which presented its own set of challenges when no signal of any form could be detected for many miles in the more remote areas along our route.

One of the 'unforeseens' came when we discovered that a couple of our riders and crew couldn't sleep in a moving vehicle. To solve this problem we'd anticipate where a shift would end and try to book a motel room there. The resting riders would be driven about 120 miles along the route and deposited in the room. The incoming riders would jump into the 'still warm' beds and rest before themselves being transported a further 120 miles to the next change of shift.

As a crew member, I got to meet a few locals as I travelled from west to east. Apparently more than half of Americans have never travelled outside the USA, almost two-thirds do not even own a passport and more than a few have never been outside their own state. So when you mention you're part of a team cycling across America, they're stunned and impressed in equal measure.

I'm not suggesting the following encounter is typical, but it certainly made an impression on me…

Halfwaythrough the race we were having some difficulties with a faulty generator on our motorhome. So one of our crew wandered over to a giant truck, explained our problem to the driver and asked if he could possibly help.

After a moment, the driver looked down and said: 'I don't know nothing about generators.' He then paused for several seconds before continuing: 'But I know a whole lot about chickens.'

Fortunately, we hadn't experienced any problems with chickens, so his expertise in this area wasn't required.

A few of our crew and cyclists were so moved by the overall RAAM experience they are planning a 'race within a race' next year. As 2015 sees the Rugby World Cup taking place, they approached numerous former international rugby players from around the world and invited them to participate.

Many have responded saying they're keen. It seems cycling is the preferred method of keeping fit for retired players with 'dodgy knees' (they have no idea what they're letting themselves in for!).

If you fancy taking part in such an experience, ask yourself the following questions: Do I have a sense of adventure? Can I function on very little sleep? Do I have a modicum of common sense? Am I willing to commit to a seriously tough challenge?

If the answer to all of these is yes, take a look at the RAAM website - www.raceacrossamerica.org. Who knows, you might be inspired to get a team together and enter the challenge.

Our team covered all our costs (excluding flights, which were paid by each individual) through corporate sponsorship and in addition raised more than £50,000 for Asthma UK.

A landmark on the way forward: David was also entranced by the Gettysburg battlefield in Pennsylvania

We never did catch up with Pippa's team, who were riding for another charity, the Michael Matthews Foundation, which campaigns for education for all. They finished almost a full day ahead of us.

I know how incredibly hard our cyclists worked, so hats off to Pippa's team.

She may have a famous sister and a 'party girl' reputation, but on this occasion she definitely walked the walk... or, more accurately, cycled the cycle, all the way across America.
