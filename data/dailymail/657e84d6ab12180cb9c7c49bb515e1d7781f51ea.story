Two of the biggest beer makers in the world have posted details of what goes into Budweiser and Miller Lite after pressure from a food blogger.

Anheuser-Busch and MillerCoors detailed the ingredients of some of their most popular brands on Thursday, and promised to be more transparent in the future.

The announcements come a day after blogger Vani Hari posted a petition on FoodBabe.com to get major brewers to list what goes in their beverages.

Because the Treasury department rather than the Food and Drug Administration oversees alcoholic beverages, no law exists to force brewers to list the ingredients they use.

Since Hari highlighted the discrepancy, Anheuser-Busch listed ingredients for
 its two top-selling brands on its website, tapintoyourbeer.com. It 
lists the same ingredients for Budweiser and Bud Light: water, barley 
malt, rice, yeast and hops.

The company, which also makes Beck's, Busch 
and Michelob beers, said it will list the ingredients for all of its 
other brands online 'in the coming days'.

Thursday's disclosure was the first time 
Anheuser-Busch had detailed the ingredients of its beers.

MillerCoors posted the ingredients of Miller Lite, Coors Light and six other brands on its Facebook page. Most are made from water, barley malt, corn, yeast and hops, the company said.

'We also value transparency and are happy to comply with the request for additional information,' MillerCoors said in a statement.

The company says that consumers can call to ask what ingredients are in their beer, and it will also put more information online 'in the days ahead'. Its other brands in the U.S. include Peroni and Redd's Apple Ale.

Both companies said that they are not required to list ingredients, but are doing so voluntarily because customers want it.

Hops to it: The makers of Budweiser listed what goes into its drinks after an online campaign

An online petition, started Wednesday by Hari, has more than 44,000 signatures.

Hari has become a powerful voice in the food industry. She is the same blogger who successfully pushed sandwich chain Subway to remove an ingredient in its bread that is also used in yoga mats.

She chose to petition beer makers because her husband drinks beer, and she wants to be able to see what she is buying.

Representatives from Anheuser-Busch invited Hari and her family to visit its brewery in St Louis to see how its beers are made. Hari said she is working with the company to schedule a visit.
