Bermuda suffered extensive powercuts after it was battered by Hurricane Gonzalo but it escaped the catastrophic damage and death toll that many had feared.

Much of the Atlantic archipelago was without electricity this morning and many roads were impassable due to downed trees and debris.

Only minor injuries were reported, however, Bermuda officials said.

The clean-up begins in Hamilton, Bermuda after it was hit by Hurricane Gonzalo although the whole scale destruction and large death tolls predicted never materialised

The strongest storm to sweep the subtropical British territory in ten years hit Bermuda with maximum sustained winds of around 110mph as it reached landfall Friday night, forecasters said, with hurricane-force winds extending up to 60 miles from its centre.

Premier Michael Dunkley said in a statement that islanders awoke to damaged property, blocked roads and no electricity, 'all things that can be replaced and restored'.

'I think all of Bermuda would agree that we took a licking. We are a bit bruised,' Mr Dunkley said in a radio broadcast, according to the local Royal Gazette. But, he added, 'all in all we came out of this storm much better than we expected.'

By mid-today weather on the island had improved with Gonzalo about 355 miles north-northeast of Bermuda

By mid-Saturday, weather on the island had improved with Gonzalo about 355 miles north-northeast of Bermuda, with sustained winds of 90 mph, the U.S. National Hurricane Centre in Miami said.

Bermuda Electric Light Company had restored power to thousands of customers, though about 25,000 out of 36,000 metered connections remained without electricity, the company said.

Gonzalo approached Bermuda as a Category 3 storm then weakened to Category 2 strength just before coming ashore with sustained winds of 110mph 

The last major hurricane to hit Bermuda, which is located approximately 600 miles of the coast of North Carolina, was Fabian in 2003, which caused $100million in damage.

The storm is currently continuing its path up the Atlantic and some forecasters believe its tail end will reach Britain this week.
