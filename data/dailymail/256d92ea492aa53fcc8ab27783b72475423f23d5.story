A Michigan high school student who was banned from competing in his school track meet unless he got rid of the pink Mohawk that honors his cancer-stricken mother has decided to quit the team rather than give in to regulations.

Mike Barker, a junior at West Iron County High School in Iron River, told FoxNews he was told his new hair style did not meet the school's grooming and appearance policy.

He was told by his coach and then the school principal that he could not compete in his team's meet on Thursday unless he changed his haircut to something more conservative.

'[My coach] told me I can't have pink hair with Mohawk to support my mom with breast cancer,' the 17-year-old told FoxNews.

Banned: West Iron County High School student and track athlete Mike Barker wanted to show his support for his mother's fight against breast cancer by dyeing his mohawk-style hair bright pink

Barker said he was told to shave his head or return it to its natural state (pictured) otherwise he would not be permitted to compete

Honored: Wendy Pawlicki, 37, who has battled breast cancer three times, said she is outraged that the school only had a problem with her son's hair once he dyed it pink

'I want this to change. That's my goal'

Barker said the idea began when he and his mom were talking at the start of football season in the fall.

'She said, 'You know what you should do for me? You should dye your hair pink and make a Mohawk for me',' Barker said.

By the time basketball season came around, his hair was long enough for a Mohawk and finally on Wednesday he bleached his hair to prepare for dying it pink.

His mother, Wendy Pawlicki, said she was all the more outraged because her son had been to track practice for weeks with his Mohawk, but it was only when he dyed it pink that he was suddenly not allowed to compete.

West Iron County High School principal Mike Berutti released a statement about the incident, reiterating their regulations, which Barker confirmed he was aware of before he chose the hairstyle.

'The West Iron County Public Schools supports the needs of the students to express themselves, as long as their expression does not interfere with the educational process,' the statement said.

'We also strive to balance individualism of athletes with the concept of team that fit within our athletic code.

'The athletic department is going to work with the student and parents to resolve this issue. 

'The student was not dismissed from the team and we welcome his participation in the future. 

'The athletic department has long supported breast cancer awareness by participating in numerous events involving student athletes and staff held in October (Breast Cancer Awareness Month) and plan to continue to support this worthy cause.'

But Barker says it was,in fact, his principal, in addition to his track coach, who said it was shave his head or not compete in the track meet.

Pawlicki said several family members have had cancer and she was proud of her son's commitment to raise awareness with his pink Mohawk. 

Following the controversy, a group of students arrived at the track meet with similarly-styled pink Mohawks.

Barker, along with the other students who fashioned their hair after him, were not allowed to compete.

Even students from other schools are joining in on the trend, Pawlicki said.

'I'll support him in whatever he's doing,' she said.

Barker and his supporters have been circulating a support 
petition which he hopes to turn into the school board.

He says he does 
not regret his decision, and is going to try for track again next 
year, again with a Mohawk.
