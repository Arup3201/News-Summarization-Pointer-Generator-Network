Everyday drivers are seeing their cars invaded by total strangers thanks to the Uber car service app.

While it's given drivers the power to make money with their cars, Uber is also creating some very uncomfortable situations in cities across America as users unwittingly hop in the back seats of drivers who are simply trying to park.

As the service becomes ever more popular, complaints about the unintended 'Uber Effect' are racking up on social media.

Uber effect: It's been great for drivers trying to make a buck and people in need of a lift, but the Uber Effect is seeing users across America mistakenly jumping into the cars of unwitting strangers 

Some victims of the unsettling situations blame themselves--or at least their choice of car.

'The uber effect: a random dude just tried to get in my car #sfpriusproblems,' tweeted @urchkin.

San Francisco isn't the only city where a certain hybrid Toyota is simply assumed to be an Uber.

'As if I needed more evidence of the monotonous ubiquity of the Los Angeles Prius, today, I was mistaken for someone's Uber driver,' @wlsalyers. 

Some drivers have even felt the Uber Effect multiple times, suggesting this side effect is hardly rare. 

Ooops: The problem gets a lot of complaints in San Francisco, but Uber's popularity means it's cropping up all over

Annoying: Some victims of the Uber Effect say they've been struck multiple times

Not just Uber: The service's competitor Lyft is causing the mix-ups, too--though Lyft cars, at least outside of New York City, feature an unmistakable pink mustache on the grill

'Tonight marks the second time a random person has tried to get in my car because they thought I was an Uber driver,' tweeted @jamiecoletta. 'THE SECOND TIME.'

The San Francisco company is an uber success story. From a $330 million valuation in 2011 to a $3.4 billion valuation this month, the service has become ubiquitous in cities large and small across America.

However, the company has a competitor in second-fiddle Lyft, which appears to be having an effect of its own.

'"Are you Lyft? OH MY GOD YOU'RE NOT." - the woman who got in my car while I was trying to park,' tweeted Buzzfeed's Louis Peitzman.

Uber's popularity suggests its awkward side effect won't likely go away easily. In November 2011, the company was valuated at $330 million. This month, investors said its worth had spiked to over $3 billion

Apps like Uber and Lyft allow people with all types of vehicles to become chauffeurs--meaning they're almost impossible to tell one from the other
