 

Korean Air heiress Cho Hyun-ah has been handed a one-year jail term for aviation law violations following her 'nut rage' on an airplane.

The court said Cho, who was a Korean Air executive vice president at the time, was guilty of forcing a flight to change its route at New York City's JFK airport, and two other charges.

The 40-year-old had taken exception to being served macadamia nuts she had not asked for in a bag, not a bowl. She ordered the chief flight attendant off the flight, forcing the taxiing plane to return to the gate.

Jailed: Korean Air heiress Cho Hyun-ah (above) has been sentenced to a year for her notorious 'nut rage' incident that caused an uproar in South Korea 

The daughter of Korean Air's chairman has been in custody since December 30 and was charged with forcing a flight to change its normal route and which carries a maximum prison sentence of 10 years.

The district court in Seoul ruled that Cho had illegally altered the course of the plane, judging that an aircraft was 'in flight' from the moment it begins to move.

Cho, who has been in custody since December 30, made a grovelling apology (above) where she bowed her head in shame and said she was 'sorry' following the incident

Cho had treated the flight 'as if it was her own private plane', justice Oh Sung-Woo said.

'It is doubtful that the way the nuts were served was so wrong,' Oh added.

The judge said Cho had failed to show enough remorse for her actions, even though she had submitted some letters to the court expressing repentance for her behaviour.

Cho, who attended the court in a green prison outfit, stood silently throughout the ruling, her head bowed while she was sentenced to one year in prison.

She had pleaded not guilty to most of the charges, including physically assaulting the chief steward, Park Chang-Jin, who says she made him kneel and beg for forgiveness while jabbing him with a service manual.

The case triggered a huge public backlash, which Justice Oh said had 'damaged the dignity of the country.' 

Park Chang-jin (left), the chief flight attendant ordered off the flight by angry Cho, told the court he and other staff were treated like 'feudal slaves' by the heiress. Her father and airline chairman Cho Yang-ho (right) called her behaviour 'foolish' and said that he regretted that he did not raise her better

She was seen as emblematic of a generation of spoilt and arrogant offspring of owners of the giant family-run conglomerates, or 'chaebols,' that dominate the South Korean economy.

Like Cho, many are given senior positions in the family business, sometimes after a token period 'learning the trade'.

In the past, chaebol owners have appeared to be above the law. Those convicted of gross fraud have either received lenient sentences or been granted pardons after just a short time in jail.

Cho resigned from all her posts and publicly apologised for her behaviour, which her father and KAL chairman Cho Yang-Ho also criticised as a 'foolish act'. 

She backed up her actions and said that cabin crew in first class had made a mistake by not following proper procedures, Seoul Western District Court heard.

During the incident which occurred on December 5, Park Chang-jin, the chief flight attendant, was ordered off the plane by angry Cho, following a heated confrontation with cabin crew because she was served nuts in a bag instead of on a dish.

Furious that he had not followed protocol, she screamed at Park and told him to bring out the company's in-flight service manual so he could read the proper nut-handling guidelines.

When he failed to find it, Cho lost her cool and ordered him off the flight.

Without giving the 250 passengers on board a warning, the Incheon-bound plane was forced to return to the gate at John F Kennedy Airport in New York. The Airbus A380 eventually arrived in South Korea 11 minutes late.

In court, Park said he and other staff were treated like 'feudal slaves' by the heiress.

And a statement from one crew member described Cho as behaving like an 'angry tiger' during the incident.

Cho did admit to using violence against one flight attendant by pushing her shoulder and throwing an object at her.

She also said she did not realize the chief flight attendant has law enforcement authority during the flight and that by ordering the chief flight attendant off the plane was consequently a risk to safety. The 'final call' about returning to the gate was made by the captain, said Cho.

'I think this case happened because of devotion to my work and because I could not be considerate to other people,' she said. 

During the trial, cabin crew told the court they were pressured by Korean Air executives to cover up the incident and to lie to investigators. 

The 40-year-old's 'nut rage' tantrum caused an uproar in South Korea where the economy is dominated by family-run conglomerates known as 'chaebol' that often act above the law. She resigned from her role as executive vice president

Macadamia nut sales rose following Cho Hyun-ah's 'nut rage' tantrum.

Auction, a South Korean unit of eBay and South Korea's second-largest e-commerce website, said last December that sales of macadamias surged nearly 12-fold without any promotions.

It also said macadamias previously made up five per cent of its nut sales but said (at the time) they were accounting for almost half. 

Prosecutors called for two years in prison for Kim Woon-sub, a transport ministry official and former Korean Air executive accused of leaking secrets about the ministry's investigation.

Following the incident last December, Cho made a grovelling apology where she bowed her head in shame and admitted in a trembling voice that she was 'sorry'. 

Cho's lawyers did not dispute the major elements of the prosecutor's account of events, and instead focused on a technical rebuttal of the charges.

This has included trying to demonstrate flight attendants did not know proper service procedures.

On the most serious charge of changing a flight's route, they argued events fell short of that definition because the plane was only meters from the gate when it turned around. 

She backed up her actions and said that cabin crew in first class had made a mistake by not following proper procedures, Seoul Western District Court heard. 

During the trial, cabin crew told the court they were pressured by Korean Air executives to cover up the incident and to lie to investigators.  

The court said Cho Hyun-ah was guilty of forcing a flight to change its route and two other charges. It also found Cho guilty of obstructing the flight's captain in the performance of his duties and forcing a crew member off a plane. It found her not guilty of interfering with a transport ministry investigation into the incident.

A letter was read in court about how Cho, one of the richest women in South Korea who regularly flew first class, was adjusting to the basic conditions of her prison and finding time to reflect on her life. 'I know my faults and I'm very sorry,' she said.
