Tragedy: Tributes have been paid to 'much loved and wholly dedicated' police officer, DC Adele Cashman

A superfit policewoman died after collapsing as she pursued two muggers.

Adele Cashman, 30, had given chase to the teenage pair moments after they stole a woman’s phone.

Colleagues rushed to her aid but she died 90 minutes later in hospital.

Investigators are waiting for the results of a post-mortem examination to discover what caused the detective constable’s death in Belsize Park, North London.

One colleague said Miss Cashman, who took part in triathlons, had been stressed by the pressure and long hours of a crackdown on street crime.

However she had just secured her dream move to join the Met’s Trident team, a unit  that specialises in tackling gang crime.

Dozens of colleagues travelled to the scene to lay flowers while flags flew at half mast at police stations.

Scotland Yard chief Bernard Hogan-Howe said: ‘Adele was out there being brave, getting stuck in and then this great tragedy has happened.

‘It is a terrible loss to everybody who knew her.’

In pursuit: Detective Constable Adele Cashman collapsed while chasing a teenage phone thief yesterday

The tragedy happened after a 59-year-old woman had her smartphone snatched from her hand in Camden at about 9.30pm on Monday.

Miss Cashman chased her attackers and 
was joined by a uniformed patrol who called for back-up on their radios.

The detective, who was working in plain clothes, joined the pursuit 
with a male colleague.

They spotted one of the  suspects in Belsize Park Gardens, a road where homes cost up to £6million.

Moments later Miss Cashman fell to the ground while in pursuit.

Police and residents went to help her and she was rushed by ambulance to the Royal Free Hospital where she died.

Two boys of 17 were arrested nearby 
and the smartphone was recovered.

They remained in custody last night. 
Miss Cashman’s parents, Geoff, 50, and Lorraine, 53, were told the news 
while on holiday in the United States and were travelling home to 
Bristol to be with her four siblings.

Their daughter, who lived with three friends in Hackney, East London, joined the Met in 2006.

Camden Borough Commander Richard Tucker said: ‘Adele was a much loved and wholly dedicated officer.

‘We at Camden are completely devastated.’

All officers must complete annual 
refresher training, including a fitness test in which  they must declare
any ill health or injuries.
