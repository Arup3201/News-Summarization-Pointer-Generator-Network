Off the hook: A lawyer overseeing the federal investigation into Lance Armstrong says there are no plans to charge him over the doping scandal

The company that awarded Lance Armstrong $12million in bonuses for three of his seven Tour de France victories will now fight him in court to get it back.

The shamed cyclist said earlier this week that he would not be paying back the the millions he collected in bonuses from Texas-based SCA Promotions during three of his seven Tour de France victories.

Those victories came in 2002, 2003 and 2004 - all races in which Armstrong admitted that he cheated to win.

It will be the latest legal battle for Armstrong since he admitted last month that doped repeatedly during his storied career.

In a blockbuster interview with Queen of Talk Oprah Winfrey, Armstrong said he had used performance-enhancing substances before all seven of his

But despite the confession, the Armstrong camp insists that the bonus funds are his, and they're non-refundable.

Armstrong's lawyer Tim Herman told USA Today that his client has no intention of repaying Texas-based SCA Promotions, which paid and insured the $12million 
he was awarded in bonuses during three of his seven Tour de France wins.

Mr Herman told USA Today: 'My only point is no athlete ever, to my understanding, has ever gone back and paid back his compensation. Not [New Orleans Saints coach] Sean Payton or anybody else.

Payton was banned from the NFL for the entire 2012-2013 football season for his role in pushing a 'crush-for-cash' bounty program on the team.

Herman added: 'They were suspended, but nobody said you've got to give your paycheck back.'

Should Lance Armstrong be charged for perjury after admitting to Oprah that he had doped?

Meanwhile, it has been revealed that Armstrong is the subject of an active criminal investigation by federal investigators.

The ex-Tour de France champion is potentially facing charges of obstruction, witness tampering and intimidation relating to the systematic cover-up of his drug-taking when he was competing.

The revelation runs contrary to statements made today by the U.S. Attorney for Southern California, Andre Birotte, who spent nearly two years on a criminal investigation of Armstrong, 41, only to suddenly drop it this time last year.

Sources told ABC News that
agents had recommended an indictment for the drug-cheat on charges of 
drug distribution, fraud and conspiracy and were stunned when the case 
was suddenly dropped.

Last night, a high level source told the network: 'Birotte does not speak for the federal government as a whole.'

According to the same source who spoke on the condition of anonymity, 'Agents are actively investigating Armstrong for obstruction, witness tampering and intimidation.'

An email to an attorney for Armstrong was not immediately returned to ABC News.

The statement made earlier today by Andr√© Birotte, the U.S. attorney based in Los Angeles, follows Armstrong's confession in a blockbuster interview last month.

'We made a decision on that case a 
little over a year ago. Obviously, we've been well aware of the 
statements that have been made by Mr Armstrong in other media reports.

Shamed: Armstrong told Oprah that he never tried to stop or change the culture of drug use in the sport

'That does not change my view at this time,' Birotte said at a news conference in Washington to announce an unrelated lawsuit against Standard & Poor's.

The government will continue to look at the case, Birotte added, but Armstrong's admission 'hasn't changed our view as I stand here today.'

In February 2012, Birotte said his office had closed its investigation into possible crimes by Armstrong.

Birotte's comments come amid a firestorm of backlash against the disgraced cyclist with his actions since his doping admission.

On Tuesday, Armstrong tied with former Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te'o in atop a Forbes poll ranking America's most disliked athletes.

Speculation about charges began anew 
after Armstrong reversed his past doping denials in an interview with 
Queen of Talk Oprah Winfrey.

Confession: Armstrong admitted to Oprah Winfrey that his seven Tour de France titles were won with the help of performance-enhancing drugs, but he denied that he used them for his 2009 comeback

He told Winfrey he used performance-enhancing drugs and doping in cycling tournaments.

Legal experts said Armstrong exposed himself to possible charges of perjury or obstruction of justice.

Separately, Armstrong faces a civil whistleblower lawsuit filed by former teammate Floyd Landis, accusing Armstrong of fraud.

The U.S. Justice Department has not 
said whether it intends to join the suit, and Birotte did not address 
the suit at the news conference.

Armstrong has been banned from cycling for life and stripped of race wins, including seven Tour de France victories.

Herman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.

Opponent: Armstrong has a continuing feud with USADA CEO Travis Tygart, who spearheaded a probe into doping on Armstrong's U.S. Postal Service teams

Armstrong's lawyers said last month that he will talk more about drug use in the sport, just likely not to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency that led the effort to strip him of his Tour de France titles.

The question is: When?

In a testy exchange of letters and statements revealing the gulf between the two sides, USADA urged Armstrong to testify under oath to help 'clean up cycling.'

Armstrong's attorneys responded that the cyclist would rather take his information where it could do more good - namely to cycling's governing body and World Anti-Doping Agency officials.

USADA's response to that: 'The time for excuses is over.'

The letters underscore the continuing
feud between Armstrong and USADA CEO Travis Tygart, the man who 
spearheaded the investigation that uncovered a complex doping scheme on 
Armstrong's U.S. Postal Service teams.

Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France victories last year and he has been banned for life from the sport.

In the Oprah interview, Armstrong said he owed a long list of 
apologies and that he would like to see his lifetime ban reduced so he 
can compete again.

His most realistic avenue toward that
might be telling USADA everything he knows in a series of interviews 
the agency wants started no later than today.

That seems unlikely.
