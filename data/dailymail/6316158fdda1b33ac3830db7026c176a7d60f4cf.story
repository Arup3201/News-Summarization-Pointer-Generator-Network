An Oklahoma family has shared the heartbreaking tale of how three of four unrelated daughters-in-law were diagnosed with breast cancer, with one tragically losing her life.

Robert and Wilma Wehrenberg had four boys - Mark, Michael, David and Paul. The couple  had wanted a girl but decided their sons' wives would be the daughters they never had.

'And that's what we had - four wonderful daughters-in-law,' Robert told NewsOK.com.

Stacy Wehrenberg, Michael's wife, was the first to be diagnosed, in 2010. The couple worked together at the University of Oklahoma and married on New Year's Eve 2002. Not long after, they had their daughter Abbey, who's now 9.

It was around the holidays that doctors told the family Stacy had a type of breast cancer that was fairly simple to treat.

In January 2011, they told her they were wrong. It turned out she had a rare form of breast cancer known as metaplastic carcinoma, which is already considered invasive at diagnosis.

Doctors removed the tumor but the cancer was aggressive and had already spread through her blood system.

Stacy finished her chemotherapy in October 2011 and had two good months, including a happy Thanksgiving that her family will always cherish.

But predictably her cancer came back. In March 2012, she went to the doctor complaining of aches and pains. She was told the cancer had spread through her bones and she was given six months to live.

'I think most doctors agreed that she just really never got over it,' her husband Michael said.

Despite
the grim prognosis, Stacy didn't give up. She enrolled in a drug trial 
at a cancer center in Houston. But while two patients on the trial made 
complete recoveries, Stacy's cancer got worse.

Meanwhile,
in April 2012, David's wife, who is also called Stacy, found a lump in 
her breast. The couple kept it to themselves at first and later learned 
it was not cancer.

They
were relieved, but her guilt at being healthy when one, and later two 
more Wehrenberg sisters-in-law weren't so lucky, gave her a heavy heart.

'I kept telling her, "There's a reason — maybe there's a reason. Maybe you need to be the rock,"' David told the news website.

Tammy, Paul's wife, was next. After she turned 40, she decided to have her first annual mammogram.

Soon it was an ultrasound, a biopsy and then doctors were taking a sample of her breast tissue.

'We
think this is cancer,' the doctors told her. Though hers was in an 
early stage - 0 or 1 - the diagnosis got worse and worse, Paul said.

After she was told 17 of her lymph nodes were involved, she chose to have a double mastectomy.Michael's wife Stacy was nothing but supportive.

'The
best thing Stacy ever told me when I was diagnosed was "Just because 
I've been given my death sentence doesn't mean you're not allowed to 
have your feelings. So don't feel like you can't call me and talk to me 
about how you feel,"' Tammy said. 'What a gift. I don't know how she 
knew how to say that.'

And she did lean on her sister-in-law.

In summer 2012, when she was sitting 
on her bed with one of her two daughters Allison, Tammy pulled out a 
chunk of her hair. She called Stacy, sobbing. Twenty minutes later, she 
had got her head shaved.

As she suffered the brutal side effects of chemotherapy and recovered from her mastectomy, she was in a great deal of pain.

'It's
very hard on a family,' Paul said. 'It got to where she was hurting so 
much, if I would touch her or Della would touch her ... it hurt. It 
scared Della. She still has problems in not wanting to hurt her mom.'

Meanwhile,
Stacy's cancer had doubled while she was on the drug trial. With little
left that doctors could try, Stacy decided to come home. And she and 
Michael, with their family and friends around them, renewed their vows.

After almost 10 years of marriage, 
they wed again at the McFarlin United Methodist Church in Norman, and at
the reception Stacy danced.

'She had a natural high that whole evening,' David said. 'You wouldn't think she was as sick as she was.'

After
a final family vacation in Disneyland in July, Stacy started losing her
vision and doctors found a tumor behind her eye. They decided to bring 
hospice care into their home.

She passed away on September 26, 2012, aged 52, surrounded by her family.

'I
never saw her not upbeat,' her father-in-law, Robert told the 
newspaper. 'Even though she was so down, she kept it to herself if she 
felt bad. She kept cheering us up, too. We wanted to keep her spirits 
up, but it wasn't hard to keep her spirits up. She was a special 
person.'

Just days later, Tammy finished her chemotherapy.

She threw a party to celebrate with 60 friends, and toasted her brave sister-in-law.

'It
was still very hard with her not being there because her death was 
still very fresh and raw. I still carry that with me,' she said.

But the family's battle with breast cancer was not over.

Mastectomy: After Tammy, Paul's wife, turned 40, she decided to have her first annual mammogram. Soon it was an ultrasound, a biopsy and then doctors were taking a sample of her breast tissue

On October 10, 2012, Mark's wife Amy went to get a mammogram after discovering a lump on her breast a few months earlier.

Her
mother and grandmother had had the disease, and having watched Stacy 
and Tammy fight so valiantly, she was understandably scared.

On October 17, Mark's birthday, Amy was diagnosed with breast cancer.

'It
was a big surprise to all of us, especially since it was a few weeks 
after Stacy's service,' Michael said. 'We're like, "Three, in the same 
family, yet not blood relatives. How does that happen?"'

Amy
had eight rounds of chemotherapy over the next few months and opted to 
remove the lump, rather than undergo a full mastectomy.

She lost her hair, and her children , Matthew and Amanda, cut theirs short to show their support.

However, her hair has now grown back.

Supportive: Tammy, pictured, said Stacy was nothing but supportive and told her 'Just because I've been given my death sentence doesn't mean you're not allowed to have your feelings'

Amy finished her chemotherapy in May, 2012 and radiation in August.

'We're going to say I'm cancer free,' Amy told the news website.

Meanwhile, on January 31 this year, Tammy had her last radiation treatment on and doctors told her simply: 'Go live your life.'

The Wehrenbergs hope their harrowing story will encourage other women to get regular mammograms and inspire breast cancer sufferers to fight hard for their families.

'If you do get the worst of it, you've just got to fight,' Amy said. 'You've got to take it and fight like a girl because there's not a female who won't fight to the death for her family. You've just got to fight for your life for your family.'

Today, three pink ribbons made from wood sit outside Robert and Wilma's home, representing the three 'wonderful daughters-in-law' who, despite only being related through the brothers they married, shared so much more.
