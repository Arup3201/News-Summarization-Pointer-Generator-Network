Ashley says her mum's favourite Mother's Day present was a gadget  she said she didn't want

I can vividly remember the Mother’s Day when I bought my mum the one gift she had expressly forbidden me to buy. 

It was Tivo: a way to record favourite TV shows, which at the time was novel and new to the market and something I was sure she could use. 

She was adamant about not wanting it and not watching enough TV for it to be useful. 

Even so, I persevered knowing that many of her favourite cooking shows, home design programmes and Poirots recording all by themselves would be something she would quickly learn to love. 

I also suspected that her reticence had to do with her own unspoken fear that she wouldn’t be able to master a complicated remote control. 

Despite her protestations, I bought it anyway, and almost immediately it became one of her favourite gifts of all time.

So whether it’s something she’s intimidated by, technology she isn’t familiar with, a beauty treatment she finds too extravagant or doesn’t think she needs – or if you’re just tired of giving her the same Emma Bridgewater mug with flowers every year, here are the top 15 gifts you should buy for your mum this Mother’s Day, that she doesn’t know she wants (yet). 

1) A540A phone from Gigaset £39.99 johnlewis.com

See who’s calling without getting your glasses. Stylish and fun, the A540A phone from Gigaset has 20 different ringtones and four backlight colours which can be matched to phonebook contacts so mom can tell at a glance who the caller is: ie pink for friends, green for family, blue for work and orange for those she hates talking to! 

2) Countertop wine cooler £155 www.husky-retail.com

Does mum love a glass of chilled rose? Go for a countertop wine cooler. A fantastic luxury gift with a capacity of 12 bottles of wine at the perfect temperature and featuring a curved mirror-effect door, the Husky HN6 Reflections Slimline countertop wine cooler is digitally controlled via a touch screen. It can be adjusted to store the wine at any temperature between eight - 18ºC, making it perfect for storing red, white or rose wine at the optimum temperature. 

3) The phone for baby boomers’ Amplicomms M9000 £139 SIM-free from hearingdirect.com

Is she afraid of smart phones? Here’s one that may work for her. Marketed as ‘the phone for baby boomers’ Amplicomms M9000 has all the normal smart phone features (great videos and camera) plus things like an SOS button, extra-loud volume, larger icons, easy to read text and hearing aid compatibility. 

A phone you can see without your glasses, a countertop wine cooler and a phone with an SOS button are among Ashley's top gifts this Mothering Sunday...

4) NutriBullet  £99 www.currys.co.uk

 A huge sell out in the States before it made its way over here; there’s a reason that Kate Middleton has one of these on her countertop. Whatever blender mum currently uses, this one is probably more useful. It takes up little counter space and it neatly gets the job done. It bursts open seeds, cracks stems, and shreds skins – no peeling needed. It’s also easy to clean which is a big yes. 

5) Kindle One e-reader £49 Amazon.co.uk

Mum may still be holding out on getting a e-reader but there is no time better to take the leap than now. In honour of Mother’s Day Amazon currently has a special of £49 deal of on a new Kindle. One big bonus? If mom lives far away, as mine does, you can share an account and load up the same books. Thus, you can read the same books at the same time and discuss it all seamlessly. 

6) Lavazza A Modo Mio Minù £74.99 www.coopelectricalshop.co.uk

Is mum still clinging to her old filtered coffee machine? If so I have two suggestions for machines she will love.

Comes with six strength settings as well a programmable mode that remembers how you like it. 309 pounds www.lakeland.co.uk 

Or if she wants it keep it simple go with the Lavazza A Modo Mio Minù. A tongue twister for sure, but it’s also maximum efficiency in a small size. It fits on the smallest of counters and is extremely easy to use: adjustable at two different height settings to prepare both espresso and long coffee.

...or why not try out a NutriBullet juicer, Kindle e-reader for £49 or Nespresso's latest coffee machine
