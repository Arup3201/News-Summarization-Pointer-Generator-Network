Cyclists are being warned over the dangers of using apps Strava and MapMyRide after it was revealed that thieves are using them to find out where they live and steal their expensive bikes.

The apps are used to record detailed route maps using satellites as well as average speed, elevation and the number of calories burned - which can be stored publicly and seen by other users.

With many cyclists including details of their bike's make and model and then starting the apps' recording from their home, burglars are given the luxury of being able to pick and choose their targets.

It is also thought that thieves are using Facebook and Twitter accounts, where people often post pictures of their bikes, to gain information and then search the apps for their potential address. 

Sergeant Rob Danby, from Humberside Police and part of the Riverside neighbourhood policing team, which covers Hull city centre, is warning people to ensure privacy settings are activated. 

He said: 'Members of the public should take care when using apps such as Strava to ensure they do not inadvertently give away private information and locations.

'Such apps can give criminals a clue to where valuable items may be stored.'

The force does not collect data showing how burglaries have occurred, but cycling shop owners say that according to their customers, apps are increasingly being blamed for break-ins.

Wayne Preston, of Cliff Pratt Cycles in  Hull, said: 'People who have had bikes stolen come into the shop and we get into the conversation of what happened.

'In some cases, people have not activated the privacy settings on Strava.'

Mr Preston is also warning over the dangers of using social media to 'advertise' expensive bicycles.

'I don't have any pictures of my bikes on Facebook, but I know people do,' he said. 'People happily put photos of their shining £3,000 bike up for everyone to see.'

When criminals spot a bike they like they can search Strava for that person's name and, if privacy settings are not enabled, they have a potential address where the person begins and ends their rides.

Mr Preston said: 'The best advice I can give is if you are going to use apps make sure you switch it off a good distance from your house.

'Personally, I would much rather lose a mile off my Strava record than have my house or garage burgled and my bikes stolen.'

Strava, MapMyRide and various other so-called 'cyclist apps' work on a very similar basis.

Their point? To allow riders to record their activity on a range of compatible GPS devices, including iPhone, Android, some fitness watches and Google Glass.

The kind of data they can record include the distance and where the cyclist has been on a detailed map - pinpointing exactly where the rider has been from start to end.

Calories burned, duration, speed, elevation and pace are also among the features it can track. 

Some even give suggested routes, uploaded by other users.

Cyclists can then browse, analyse and compare their efforts with previous ones as well as other users and challenge themselves to do better. Their results can also be shared with friends and ranked on a leaderboard. 

There is a range of privacy settings so users can make their profile secure, including abbreviating your name and approving users before they follow your account.

Luke Anderson, manager of Freetown Sports, also in the city, said he was  aware of criminals using apps.

'It is definitely happening,' he said. 'There is the option to block your start point and people need to use it.

'Bikes are expensive. We sell some worth up to £4,000. You need to protect them.'

Between September 2013 and September last year, bike theft increased by 15 per cent across the Humberside Police area.

Sgt Danby reinforced the need to ensure bikes, when stored in sheds or even homes, are properly secured.

'A lot of people keep bikes in sheds with minimal security,' he said. 'People need to be wary about where and how they store their bikes.

'We've known people to use a £2 lock to secure a bike worth £4,000. They won't spend £50 on a decent lock.'

Sgt Danby advised that bikes should be chained to something difficult to move inside the shed and these should also be fitted with good-quality locks with an alarm.

'Some people install CCTV, or put up a dummy camera, which can be effective,' he said.

He added that frame numbers should be entered on to the online database Immobilise - a website used by police forces across the country - which will help reunite recovered bikes with their owners.

Simon Klima, UK Country Manager at Strava, said: 'We believe it is important that our members have the tools to protect themselves and control the detail of information they share. 

'While we have not been able to confirm any cases of theft related to Strava activity uploads, we do offer a rich set of easy-to-use privacy controls for all our members.

'As a leading social platform for athletes, Strava gives members the tools to manage the information they share with friends and followers. 

'They can set privacy zones around any address such as home or office addresses, so that start and end locations of their activities aren't shared publicly.'
