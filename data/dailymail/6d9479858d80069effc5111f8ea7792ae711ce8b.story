Devoted sisters Florence Davies and Glenys Thomas have been inseparable for more than 100 years - and are the oldest identical twins in the world. 

The great-great-grandmothers have a family photo album bursting with memories from the 103 years they have shared together. 

The pair were born in 1912 - the same year the Titanic sunk and national insurance tax was introduced. And the centenary sisters have lived through two world wars, the civil rights movement and huge advances in technology and transport.

Florence Davies and Glenys Thomas are the world's oldest identical twins after celebrating their 103rd birthday together. They were born on the 22nd November 1911 and grew up in Abertridwr in the South Wales Valleys

But in their lifetime they have never left the small mining village of Abertridwr, Caerphilly. 

Their family now believe they are the oldest identical twins in the world - and credit their great age to a 'nice, quiet life'. 

Glenys's daughter Gwenda Stacey, 65, said: 'They have lived a simple life. Neither Mam or Aunty Flo can drive. They never went abroad. But they were always happiest together.'

Born in a time when community came first , Gwenda recalls her mother telling stories about the 'good old days.'

She said: 'My grandfather was a miner and very good with his hands. He made toys for the girls and their mother made their clothes. The whole family's social life was centered around their church and their community. You had to stay local in those days because it was so hard to get around.

The pair, pictured here age 68 at Christmas, have five children, 12 grandchildren and 19 great grandchildren

'My mam remembers the first bus coming to Abertridwr and what an occasion it was. Now people are less content with their lot. Everyone wants to move so fast. Their life wasn't like that.'

As young women, the twins both went into service - cleaning the homes of well off people. Gwenda said: 'They weren't allowed to go dancing or courting as teenagers. They led respectful and God-fearing lives - their parents were very religious.'

In 1932, Glenys was the first to leave home when she married a miner, William Scrivens, who died aged 67. They adopted Gwenda a few years later when it became apparent they couldn't conceive a child. 

Glenys later became a grandmother to three, a great grandmother to nine and she has one great-great-grandson. 

She also remarried in 1972, aged 60. Florence remained in the family home for two more years until she met the man she would marry, John Davies, who died aged 48.

Their father, John, was a miner and very good with his hands and their mother, Margaret, made their clothes. The whole family's social life was centered around their church and their community

Florence went on to have three children, nine grandchildren and 12 great grandchildren. She never remarried. 

Retired printer's assistant Gwenda said: 'The twins missed each other terribly when they moved out of the family home. They had shared a room until my mam left to get married. Then Aunty Flo followed suit and bought a house next door to her sister. 

'For all their independent years they lived side by side - raising families together, shopping, socialising and cooking together too.' 

Now the elderly sisters have moved into a care home as their mental health has deteriorated with age. 

Gwenda expalined: 'Mam and Flo were always so active and independent. Right up until their 90s they would hop on the bus to go shopping together. They loved to look good and often bought the same outfits.

Florence, age 25 with baby Yorwerth, went on to have three children, nine grandchildren and 12 great grandchildren

Suffering from dementia, the twins, seen here aged 7 in 1918, are now looked after in the Abermill Care Home, just a five minute drive from Gwenda's home in Abertridwr

'When both of them were widowed they really took care of each other. Like all sisters they fell out but they never stopped us kids from seeing each other. 

'We were always in and out of both houses. We were one big happy family.'

Suffering from dementia, the twins are now looked after in the Abermill Care Home, just a five minute drive from Gwenda's home in Abertridwr. 

She said: 'They have adjoining rooms so they see each other whenever they like. Aunty Flo does get a bit fed up with mam's singing though. Her dementia sends her back to her childhood and she's forever singing Calon Lan - a welsh song she'd have learnt at school. 

'They are physically very well - no ailments as such. But it is their mind that's going. It can be like they are far away and mostly they don't remember the family. Yet they still ask for each other. Their connection is lasting and truly life long.'
