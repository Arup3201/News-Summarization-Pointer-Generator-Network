This couple sure can't decide if they are on or off.

On Wednesday - just one week after it was announced Pamela Anderson, 47, had filed for divorce from her husband of less than one year, Rick Salomon - the two were spotted kissing on the lips and in full embrace while in Malibu.

The beauty was so enthralled with her man she let her coverup slip off, revealing a pink bra. The twosome were also seen with their wedding rings back on.

Back on: Pamela Anderson was seen kissing husband Rick Salomon on Wednesday in Malibu, just one week after it was announced she had filed for divorce from him

Intimate moment: The blonde appeared smitten with her once estranged spouse, who had both arms around her waist

Pamela looked overjoyed to be back in the arms of Rick, who she was married to briefly in 2007. At one pointed she laughed, at another point she grabbed his face for a passionate kiss.

Before they locked lips, Rick was seen shopping in Calabasas without his wedding band on.

In both pictures the avid gambler is seen with the same outfit on - a black shirt with a white Panama hat.

Calabasas and Malibu are only about a 30 minute drive from each other if one goes through Topanga Canyon.

On Friday TMZ predicted the couple would be back on and the divorce was not serious, just a way to scare Rick straight.

'Pam
 felt the only thing she could do at this point in her relationship and 
marriage to Rick was to file for divorce because of his wild partying,' 
an insider claimed.

'They love each other, but it's always a roller coaster with Pam and Rick. No one should be shocked if they reconcile.'

It was added: 'Since she filed for divorce, Rick has been begging Pam to halt the divorce proceedings.'

No ring: Salomon went shopping without his wedding band from Anderson on while in Calabasas on Wednesday morning

Naked hand: No gold here for the poker player but that would change hours later

Ever since their split was announced a week ago, Pamela has been hitting the town without her wedding rings on.

While at the Flat Screen Nature art exhibit in LA on Saturday, the bombshell didn't appear to be wearing her rock from Salomon.

While shopping in Malibu just days earlier, she went ringless as well.

And when dining at Nobu in Malibu on the 4th of July she was solo and ring free.

It was only in January that the duo announced they had remarried. The couple were previously wed for only two months in 2007 before annulling their union.

In case you weren't sure this was him: Rick wore a T-shirt with his last name on it during an outing in LA on Thursday, the day after his kissing session took place

The ring is STILL on: One day after the gold band made its return, the piece of jewelry was still in place 

She looks happier than ever: Anderson smiled at the Flat Screen Nature art exhibit in LA on Saturday; she didn't appear to be wearing her wedding band

Just after 
news broke that she had filed for divorce from her husband of six 
months, the bombshell posted a lonely photo of herself with sunglasses 
on and looking into the Pacific Ocean with the caption 'Hope' to her 
Facebook page.

She
 also shared a photo of a religious passage that started, 'I release my 
loved ones to God.' Her caption on that read, 'I love this - there is 
freedom in this - helps...'

The two were last spotted together on June 26.

They're done: Pamela filed for divorce from Rick almost two weeks ago, according to TMZ; here they are pictured at the Cannes Film Festival on May 16

The paperwork: Anderson filed on Thursday and noted that she was not sure about 'property assets'

Ring-free already?: The Canadian didn't appear to be wearing her wedding jewelry while running errands in Malibu on Saturday

Suspiciously, there was no sign of Rick in mid June
 when she picked up an award at the Taormina Film Festival in Italy, the
 same event Melanie Griffith and Eva Longoria attended.

In documents filed on July 3 to the 
Superior Court of Los Angeles, Pamela asked for a dissolution of 
marriage.

There was also a note in the property section that stated, 
'The nature and extenet of separate property assets and debts are 
unknown to Petitioner at the time. Petitioner asks leave of court to 
amend this Petition when same is ascertained.'

All together: Pamela and her two sons Brandon and Dylan with Rick in January

No reason has yet to be given for the split and Pamela's rep has not returned calls to MailOnline.

But there have been signs the calendar girl has been troubled.

On June 28 she wrote on Twitter, 'Closing the open hand... hardest thing to do.'

On July 6 she wrote on her Twitter account, 'I no longer have the time for anyone or anything that can not give emotion, time and love, honestly, freely and with sincerity… my beautiful, soulful, mentor BB [for Brigitte Bardot].'

All alone: Just after news broke that the Barb Wire star had filed for divorce, she posted this image to Facebook and Twitter

She needs support: Anderson posted this religious message on Tuesday and said it 'helps'

It was noted by TMZ that a week ago Salomon, a 'world-class poker player,' won $2.8m in the World Series of Poker Big One for One Drop. Because Pam filed on Thursday, she may or may not be able to get some of that money under community property laws, unless there was a prenup.

This was Anderson's fourth marriage. In addition to her two marriages to Rick, she was also wed to Tommy Lee from 1995 to 1998 and Kid Rock from 2006 to 2007.

She had two sons with Tommy.

Rick is best known for co-starring with Paris Hilton in her One Night In Paris video. He is also an avid gambler.

This was their second go round: The two, pictured here in 2007, were wed for only two months roughly seven years ago

Salomon was previously married to voice actress Elizabeth Daily and Beverly Hills, 90210 actress Shannen Doherty.

On June 13 Anderson gushed about life with Salomon for a column in The Hollywood Reporter.

'We all love being together, the modern Brady Bunch. It's challenging, a juggle, but it works,' she wrote.

Pamela raved about Rick in a speech
 during the Cannes Film Festival where she said,  'He is the only man 
besides my boys that I trust.'

It was during that speech that she opened up about the sexual attacks she endured during her childhood.

She announced that she was 'molested at six, raped at 12 and gang-raped in her teens.'

She said of Rick at the time: 'His way of helping the world to be a better place is
 by caring for me, protecting me and making me happy. I am so proud of 
him.'
