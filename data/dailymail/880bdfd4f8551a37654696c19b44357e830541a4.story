It was a national tragedy that stunned the world - and for more than 50 years the exact whereabouts of a plane that crashed in Chile carrying a group of football stars remained a mystery.

Now climbers in the Andes mountain range say they have found the wreckage of the LAN Chile Douglas DC-3 that went down April 3, 1961 with 24 people on board.

The doomed aircraft's twisted remains were discovered high up in Maule, about 190 miles south of capital city Santiago by a group of mountaineers.

Discovery: A group of climbers have discovered what they believe to be the wreckage of the LAN Chile Douglas DC-3 that went down April 3, 1961 with 24 people on board, including a number of footballers

Members of the top-division Chilean team Green Cross, several of whom died in the 1961 plane crash

Human bones were also found scattered in the area amid parts of the broken plane.

Amazingly, pictures taken at the supposed crash site show pieces of the aircraft extraordinarily-well preserved after 54 years in the mountains. 

The expedition's leader, Leonardo Albornoz, said: 'The plane is more than 3,200 meters up the mountain. Quite a bit of the fuselage is still there, a lot of things scattered over the area including human bones. 

'So this story is getting a rewrite since this is not where original accounts said.'

Well-preserved: Among the pieces of twisted metal found in the mountains was the plane's propeller 

The disappearance of the Douglas DC-3 carrying members of the top-division Chilean team Green Cross was one of the great unsolved mysteries in the South American country 

Scattered remains: Climbers said that human bones were also found scattered in the area

Mr Albornoz told Chile's Channel 7 they're keeping the exact site secret to prevent looting.

The disappearance of the Douglas DC-3 carrying members of the top-division Chilean team Green Cross  was one of the great unsolved mysteries in the South American country.

The club had played an away match in Osorno in the Copa de Chile and was returning to Santiago after a 1-1 draw.

The team and staff were spread over two flights and while one of the planes reached the Chilean capital and the other apparently vanished.

High in the mountains: The remains of the aircraft were discovere in Maule, about 190 miles south of capital city Santiago - at an altitude of 3,200 metres

The best-known player to have died in the accident was Elisa Mourino (sketch above), who won 25 caps for Argentina and lifted the Copa America for his country in 1955 and 1959

Teams of rescuers spent fruitless weeks searching for the missing flight and later funerals for the missing players were held - drawing huge crowds in Chile.

Climber Mr Albornoz added: ''It was a breathtaking moment and we felt all kinds of sensations. One could feel the energy of the place and breathe the pain.'

The disappearance of the Douglas DC-3 carrying members of the top-division Chilean team Green Cross on April 3, 1961 was one of the great unsolved mysteries in the South American country and at the time stunned the sporting world.

The club had played an away match in Osorno in the Copa de Chile and was returning to Santiago. 

The team and staff were spread over two flights. One of the planes reached the Chilean capital and the other apparently vanished.

After the crash, It was reported that most of the first team players had elected to fly on the fateful plane because it was more direct, and the alternative flight was scheduled to make several stops on the way back to Santiago.

Despite losing virtually the entire first team in the disaster the club  fulfilled the second leg of the cup tie, which they lost 0-1 and were eliminated from the cup.

But the accident had a major impact on the club for years to come as it struggled to recover from the heavy loss.

The best-known player to have died in the accident was Elisa Mourino, who won 25 caps for Argentina and lifted the Copa America for his country in 1955 and 1959.

Mourino was nearing the end of his career at Green Cross after eight seasons at Argentinian giants Boca Juniors.

The club, which was one of the eight teams that founded the professional Chilean football league, sadly folded in 1984 after finishing 23rd in the Primera División.

The accident is one of the worst tragedies in professional sport, and echoes the darkest day in Manchester United's history - February 6th, 1958.
