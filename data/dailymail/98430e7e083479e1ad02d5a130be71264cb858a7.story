Greg Norman was lucky to escape with both hands intact after a chainsaw accident saw the Australian professional golfer rushed to hospital.

The 59-year-old is currently recovering from the accident in a US hospital.

Despite the ordeal, Mr Norman clearly remained in good spirits as he took to Instagram to share a picture of himself in his hospital bed.

Greg Norman revealed he was in hospital via an Instagram post in which he said he had been involved in an accident while using a chainsaw

'Working with a chainsaw ALWAYS be respectful of the unexpected,' Mr Norman wrote in the pictures caption, accompanied by symbols of hands and a thumbs up.

'I was one lucky man today. Damaged, but not down and out. Still have left hand.'

The Australian professional golfer said he was 'one lucky man' and said that he still has his left hand

A hole in a purple foam object beside him, shows a glimpse of Mr Norman's left arm, which appears to be bandaged.

Only a week earlier, the pro golfer had shared a image of himself using what is likely to be the same chainsaw on his property.

Smiling at the camera with the machine in his arms, Mr Norman is pictured standing on a beach beside a heavy branch he'd just cut down.

Norman, who currently lives in Florida in the United States, was formerly ranked the world's best golfer

'Time to trim the sea grapes today,' the caption said.

'Never ask someone to do something that you can do yourself. Love to work!'

Mr Norman, who has won  91 professional world events and was ranked the world's best golfer during the peak of his career, now lives in Florida in the United States.
