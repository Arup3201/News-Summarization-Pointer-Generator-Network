Delay: Texas Senator Wendy Davis, pictured, who is considered the Democrats' top prospect for next year's governor's race, has delayed her decision on her political future because her father is sick

Texas Senator Wendy Davis, considered the Democrats' top prospect for next year's governor's race, has delayed her decision on her political future because her father is sick.

Davis had been expected to reveal her intentions to run for public office around Labor Day.

But she said inn a statement Thursday that she will wait until her father recuperates from recent surgery before announcing her plans.

'My father has been in the hospital for the past two weeks making good but slow progress in recovering from complications following major surgery,' the Fort Worth lawmaker said in a statement.

'We remain hopeful that the improvements we've seen in his health will continue.

'As a result, I will not be making any official announcement related to my future plans for public office so that I can focus on the continued care and recovery of my father.'

Davis rose from relative obscurity to fame as a result of her 11-hour filibuster in the Texas Senate of a bill to restrict abortions in the state.

The bill eventually passed but the 
move elevated her status among Democrats, who have been largely ignored 
in statewide elections for some 20 years.

Davis' father, Jerry Russell, is being treated at Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital Southwest.

He is the founder of the Fort Worth theater company Stage West and a voice actor who has provided English dialogue for Japanese anime films and television series, according to Dallasnews.com.

Davis has said she will either run for governor or for re-election to her Senate seat in 2014.

A bid for governor would be a stretch given the last Democrat elected governor of Texas was Ann Richards in 1990.

While the party has become more competitive due to its appeal to Hispanic voters, experts believe they are still some years off winning statewide office again.
