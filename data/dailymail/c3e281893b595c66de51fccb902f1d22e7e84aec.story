A UK town home to around 13,000 people has absolutely no police officers protecting it at times during the week, a whistleblower has said.

Budget cutbacks mean Uttoxeter in Staffordshire sometimes has no-one to uphold the law and incredibly the force in charge says its strategy 'makes sense'.

A whistle-blower has revealed two officers from the town are diverted to Stoke-on-Trent on Monday nights to help police their student night.

Complaint: The whistleblower says Uttoxeter is being left un-policed at times because officers are sent to Stoke-on-Trent (pictured)

This leaves either one or none at all left in Uttoxeter and the anonymous serving policeman claims it is ‘highly unlikely’ the town would be policed after midnight.

In a devastating critique of a system he has served for more than 25 years, the whistleblower said the ‘thin blue line’ is now so stretched that officers from Burton-Upon-Trent - some 13 miles away - are being forced to cover.

Between zero and three officers hold the fort in Uttoxeter, where the station’s strength was previously as high as four or five constables and a sergeant, he said.

'We think we are just being run ragged,' he said.

'We are sticking plasters over a system that’s crumbling.

'I’m concerned, and I know officers I work with are also concerned, about the service we are giving members of the public.

'We joined to put something back into society and I know we are all disappointed we are not able to do the job we joined to do - that’s prevent crime and police the streets and make them safer.

'We understand cuts have to be made but we’re finding services are suffering because of cuts to staff and the way we are being managed.'

Andy Adams, joint branch chairman of Staffordshire Police Federation, said the whistleblower had highlighted a force-wide problem in which certain areas were ‘not being staffed to the same degree’.

'We anticipated this 18 months ago and it appears it’s now beginning to happen,' he said.

The claims emerged five years after former Burton constable Stuart Davidson revealed he was the author of best-selling ‘whistleblower’ book Wasting Police Time and popular internet diary Coppersblog - both withering exposes of the political correctness, target culture and red tape blighting policing.

But Staffordshire Police has hit back, pointing out that despite ‘challenging times’ borne of a need to save £34 million by March 2015, crime levels were the lowest in more than 10 years and victim satisfaction rates high.

They also say leaving Uttoxeter as an almost police-free zone on Monday ‘makes sense’ as it uses resources better.

But the force admits that while it has to make savings of £34 million by March 2015 with 86 per cent of our budget spent on staff costs, it is unavoidable that the organisation has to operate with fewer people.

Chief Inspector Steve Maskrey, East Staffordshire Borough Local Policing Team commander, said: 'These are challenging times and we have been working very hard over the last two years to restructure the force and transform services while protecting service delivery to our communities.

'Dealing with what matters to our communities and having the right staff in the right place at the right time is key.

'The public expect us to deliver value for money services and this means adopting a common sense approach.

'If we have demand on a particular night in one town and not another, for example student night in Burton is Thursday, whereas student night in Stoke-on-Trent is Monday, it makes sense to move some of our resources to cover this demand while ensuring sufficient resources are in place in the remaining areas.

'Many of our staff have experienced big change but have reacted brilliantly and crime levels are the lowest in more than 10 years.

'Crime levels for the first five months of this financial year are down in Uttoxeter town by seven per cent, a total of 203 reported crimes compared to 219 last year.

'It is a tribute to all staff that at a time when budgets are reducing significantly and the organisation is shrinking, crime continues to fall and victims’ satisfaction rates remain very high.'
