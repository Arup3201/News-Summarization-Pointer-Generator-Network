Caught: Jonathan Phan allegedly broke into a woman's home and climbed into bed with her

An actor has been arrested after he allegedly broke into a California woman's home during the night, removed all of his clothes apart from his underwear and got into her bed as she slept.

Jonathan Phan, a Vietnamese actor and stuntman who has appeared in a handful of TV shows and movies, then fell asleep in the woman's bed, police said.

The woman awoke to find Phan beside her and started screaming - waking him up and forcing him to jump out the window without his pants, wallet or cell phone.

She alerted authorities in Santa Ana, California and they were able to identify him by the California driver's license Phan had left at the woman's home, authorities said. 

Speaking to KCAL9, the woman, who wished to remain unidentified, said she woke up to find the man still asleep during the July incident. 

'I wake up at 8 in the morning, but he's still asleep. Then I yell,' she said.

'I said, "Who are you?" Then he [wakes] up [and says], "I'm sorry, I'm sorry'.'

Authorities arrested Phan on Friday but they did not announce a motive.

They believe he entered the home after cutting through a screen and climbing through a window.

Police said detectives don't believe that Phan knew the woman or had any ties to the home.

Starring role: Phan appeared in a movie out this year called 'Battle B-Boy', in which gangs use breakdancing to battle each other. The 29-year-old Vietnamese actor also has a smattering of TV and Shorts credits

The homeowner, whose teenage daughter was also asleep inside the house at the time, told CBS LA that she is now afraid to sleep in her own bed.

Phan now faces a charge of residential burglary and was being held on $50,000 bail, according to inmate records.

Phan, who also goes by Jae Phan, has a few movie and TV credits to his name, including the lead role in a movie out this year, Battle B-Boy, in which gangs use break dancing to battle for money.  

YouTube videos also show him presenting Vietnamese entertainment shows. 

Scene: He was allegedly found sleeping in just his underwear at this home in Santa Ana, and fled when the homeowner awoke and screamed. She said she is now scared to be in the home

Orange County Superior Court records show Phan previously pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor DUI count in 2012, and misdemeanor possession of a controlled substance and being under the influence of a controlled substance in 2013, the OC Register reported.

In this most recent case, he is due to appear in court on Tuesday.
