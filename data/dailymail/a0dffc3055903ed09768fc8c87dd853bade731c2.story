After the most incredible week of their lives, the Brownlee brothers were given a heroes' welcome as they proudly returned to their home city tonight.

Thousands of people turned out in Leeds to see the triathlon gold and bronze medal winning brothers, Alistair and Jonathan Brownlee return following the end of London 2012.

They were joined by cycling road race silver medalist Lizzie Armitstead and attended a special reception held in their honour in Millennium Square.

The crowd of around 5,000 people cheered loudly and waved Union flags as the athletes were led through the square and welcomed on to the stage.

One group held up a hand-drawn sign reading 'Pride of Yorkshire' which listed the names of the medal-winning athletes.

Also present at the celebration were members of the Team GB diving squad, including Jack Laugher, Alicia Blagg, Hannah Starling and Sarah Barrow, and weightlifters Gareth Evans and Jack Oliver.

A special welcome was given to Dee Adams, mother of gold medal-winning boxer Nicola Adams.

The Brownlee brothers said they hoped their success would inspire others.

Asked if they had a message for their Yorkshire fans, Alistair Brownlee said: 'Thank you very much for turning out, hope you enjoyed it and be inspired to do some sport, do some triathlon.'

Jonathan Brownlee described the turnout as 'absolutely incredible'.

He said: 'We didn't realise how much it would affect people back home. We come back here and see how exciting it is, it's absolutely amazing.'

Alistair added: 'It's been a fantastic week in London but to come home to Leeds is better than anything else.'

The brothers were flown into Leeds by helicopter earlier today after a 'crazy' week which saw them being treated 'like rock stars'.

But they were both looking forward to getting back to training on the Otley Chevin, near their home, with Jonathan competing again soon.

Success: The crowd was also played a message from boxing gold medalist Nicola Adams on a screen

Alistair said: 'I'm positive we 
wouldn't be where we are today without training in Leeds and Yorkshire. 
It's a fantastic place to train.'

Talking
about his hopes for his own gold medal in the future, Jonathan said: 'I
don't want to touch Alistair's gold medal just in case there's a little
curse. I want to have my own gold medal.'

Armitstead said it was incredible to be back home.

She
said: 'I'm more tired now than I've been all season but I'm just trying
to soak up the atmosphere and just looking forward to being at home for
a week, being with friends and family.'

Thanking her fans in Leeds, she said: 'I hope that it leaves a legacy, especially for young people to get into sport.'

Armitstead said the Olympics was the most special experience of her life.

She said she would now be concentrating on the World Championships in six weeks time.

Men, women and children gathered in the square hours before the ceremony began waiting to catch a glimpse of their new heroes.

Abbie Stone, 12, from Leeds, was a torchbearer before the Games began.

She said: 'We're just here to watch all the athletes come home and give them support.'

Daniel Stone, 13, added: 'I think the athletes have done really well in the Olympics, especially to beat how well they did in Beijing. We just wanted to show our support and how proud we are to be British.'

Stephen Wylde, who was accompanying 
his son and daughter and their friends, said: 'Yorkshire and Leeds, in 
particular, have done so well. We just couldn't not be here really to 
support them.'

He added: 'The Brownlee brothers obviously spurred each other on in their training. They've done brilliantly.'

Earlier in the day, the triumphant
Brownlee brothers arrived back at Yorkshire in style in a chopper  - 
but the modest pair shunned the chauffeured car laid on for them to 
travel home in a silver Vauxhall Corsa after touchdown.

They touched down in a helicopter at Leeds Bradford Airport at just after 1.30pm before heading home to nearby Bramhope.

The pair arrived to cheering crowds waving Union flags all hoping for a picture with the new local heroes.

Although a chauffeur-driven VW people carrier was offered to the popular pair, they preferred to hop into a waiting silver Vauxhall Corsa, with Alistair in the front and his younger brother in the back.

The brothers - wearing their Team GB tracksuits with their medals round their necks - admitted they were shattered after an exclusive after-party last night.

Bronze medal winner Jonny said: 'It was quite a late night last night. The closing ceremony was amazing to see, and there was a GB party afterwards. It’s been a fun two weeks.'

Asked what they were planning to do 
once they got back home, Jonny answered: 'To be honest I’m looking 
forward to going for a run. London was so busy.

'I’m looking forward to getting back to enjoying Yorkshire.'

While Olympic champion Alistair added: 'We were hoping to get back to normality.

'Being in London was like being in an Olympic bubble - we have no idea what it’s been like outside there, so it will be good to see how Yorkshire has reacted to the Olympics.'

Around 40 people waited at the airfield to welcome them home and the down-to-earth brothers were happy to pose for photographs and sign autographs.

They even let fans hold their medals - although they kept a close watch on the prizes.

'I’m not sure what could top this Olympics,' Alistair admitted. 'It was a fantastic course at our home Olympics, what could be better?

'Going forward, it’s all about the legacy that’s being talked about. Getting more people into the triathlon, getting people healthy and active and hopefully inspire some future Olympians.'
