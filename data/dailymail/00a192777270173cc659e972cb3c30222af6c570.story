Tragic: The six-figure donation since Susan Taylor's death has turned out to be a hoax

The family of a charity swimmer who died while attempting to cross the Channel have said they are 'disappointed and upset' after a six-figure donation turned out to be a hoax.

Susan Taylor, 34, collapsed just one mile from the French coast as she swam under the guidance of the Channel Swimming Association, which officially authorises attempts, on Sunday July 14.

Mrs Taylor, from Barwell, Leicsester, was pulled from the water and on to a support boat by her brother David, a paramedic, who battled to save her life before she was taken to hospital in nearby Boulogne-sur-Mer, where she was later pronounced dead.

Her death prompted thousands of people to donate to Mrs Taylor’s two fundraising pages, in support of Rainbows Hospice for Children and Young People and Diabetes UK.

However, it has now emerged one donation to Rainbows, of £150,000, was a fake - something the charity described as an 'appalling act at such a tragic and emotional time'.

It is believed a similar hoax pledge was also made to Diabetes UK.

In a statement, Mrs Taylor’s family said: '[We] were obviously delighted when news of a donation pledge of £300,000 to the two charities was announced.

'Unfortunately, it would appear that this pledge was bogus since the funds have failed to materialise in the charities’ accounts.

'[We] are disappointed and upset that an individual has taken actions which have misled the family and Susan’s chosen charities in this way.

Devastated: Susan Taylor's husband Stephen (pictured at a Christmas party) was on the support boat

Brave: Mrs Taylor, 34, wanted to emulate David Walliams' charity swim but died one mile from France

Fundraiser: David Walliams, pictured during his 2006 Channel swim, is believed to have donated £1,000

'The family wish to emphasise that they are extremely grateful for the support of members of the public and the generosity they have shown in supporting Susan’s legacy.

'We do not intend to allow the actions of one person to detract from what Susan has accomplished and the pride we feel for her.'

Legitimate donations to Mrs Taylor’s fundraising pages have soared to more than £70,000 in the days since her death.

Much-loved: Susan's father described her as 'the best person in the world'

Dedicated: Mrs Taylor had spent 18 months preparing for her arduous challenge for two charities

Prepared: Mrs Taylor's progress team posted this picture during her swim, writing: 'Easy way versus the hard way!!!!! Susan definitely deserves the easy way next time!!! She's doing fab :)'

Comedian David Walliams - who swam the Channel in 2006 - is believed to have pledged £1,000 after a donation was made under the name of the Little Britain star with the message: 'Sending all my love to Susan’s family and friends'.

Walliams tweeted later: 'Despite the shock & sadness, it’s good to see heroic Susan Taylor’s charity total rising. Please give what you can...'

Mrs Taylor had given up her full-time job to carry out charitable work and was working part-time as an accountant, her family said.

An online map tracking Ms Taylor's progress appeared to show that her support boat had suddenly sped up and sailed in a different direction towards land

Mrs Taylor was initially rescued from Wissant Bay near Cap Gris-Nez on the French coast

Before her solo attempt she told a newspaper that her training had been delayed a little by a shoulder injury and that she had put herself 'through hell' training over the last year.

Geoff Ellis, chief executive at the Rainbows charity, condemned the hoax donations. He said: 'We are shocked that a person would carry out this appalling act at such a tragic and emotional time.

'Susan devoted her life to Rainbows and since her sad passing, kind-hearted people - many of whom did not know Susan - have honoured her memory by pledging generous donations to her online fundraising page.

'We have relayed the news to the family who are devastated that someone would exploit this heart-breaking situation.'
