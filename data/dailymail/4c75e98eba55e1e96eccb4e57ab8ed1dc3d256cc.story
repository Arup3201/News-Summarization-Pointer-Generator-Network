Prince William has spoken about the pressures of being a helicopter search-and-rescue pilot and revealed how his crewmates are like a second family.

The Duke of Cambridge – or Flight Lieutenant William Wales as he is known in the RAF – reveals in a television documentary how his team copes with the ‘dodgy and dangerous’ situations their work pits them against.

He said: ‘You have to rely on each other quite a lot. So getting to know each other, being a family, is all part of that.’

Starring role: Prince William is seen planning a mission during the BBC documentary

The 30-year-old pilot, part of a four-man team based at RAF Valley in Anglesey, is shown rescuing a teenage boy who has fallen 20ft from a disused railway bridge.

When the victim is found, difficult flying conditions leave the Prince with a decision over whether to risk a landing or winch the teenager to safety.

He said: ‘It’s not easy. It makes you feel worried, concerned. You obviously want to make the right call. I have a duty of care for the crew and for the casualty. So you  do have to think very carefully.

‘When you have got either a young child or a young woman or a young man or an old man or whatever it is you are going to. It really focuses the mind when there is an actual real person at the end of it who needs your help and you are their only hope.’

Helicopter Rescue starts on April 8 on BBC Wales. It is expected to be shown nationally at a later date.
