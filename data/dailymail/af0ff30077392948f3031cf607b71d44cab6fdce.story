The Russian airline pilots who dramatically avoided a high-speed collision with a grounded plane as they came in to land have criticised their opposite numbers for pulling out in front of them.

Shocking footage of the near-miss, which took place at Barcelona Airport on Saturday, shows a Boeing 767, flown by Russian airline UTair, swooping in over the runway.

But as the plane bears down on the tarmac, a seemingly oblivious Aerolineas Argentineas Airbus A340 taxis in front of the incoming jet, which pulls up sharply to avoid disaster.

The pilots then perform a 'go-around' emergency procedure, and manage safely to land their craft, carrying 260 tourists, on their second attempt.

Commenting on the dramatic procedure to the Siberian Times, the plane's co-pilot Kirill Kuzmin also criticsed the Spanish airport's traffic controllers for falling silent during the disaster, leaving them to handle the dangerous situation themselves.

He said: 'Before getting close to the runway we heard the air traffic controller's command allowing Argentinians to cross the runway after we had landed'.

'The Argentinians repeated the comment which meant that they heard and accepted it. But then suddenly - and without a clear reason - the Argentinians got onto the runway just as our altitude was going below 100 metres.

'The air traffic controller clearly got confused. He went silent... We had nothing else to do than go on a second round.

'We have worked on this situation many times during training.' 

Nikolay
 Limarev, the captain of the plane, said the incident 'could have been 
serious if the weather was not clear as it was on that day'.

He
 also criticsed traffic controllers, saying: 'As we were getting ready 
to land, about 10, 15 seconds prior to reaching the rear end of the 
runway, we noticed the Argentinian Airbus A340-300 moving at 60 degrees 
towards the runway we were approaching.'

'The weather was fine, so after the Argentinian plane reached the runway and got onto it, we went onto a second round, not waiting for the air traffic controller's command.

'It took us about 15 minutes to complete the second round. When we finished it we approached the airport again and successfully landed at El Prat.

'As we were taxiing the airport's controller apologised on the radio for the situation.'

UTair - one of Russia's largest airlines, based at Khanty-Mansiysk in Siberia - praised the captain for his 'composure and professional excellence' after 'appropriately' assessing the situation.

The airline said that the matter was under 'investigation'. 

Spanish airport authority AENA announced a request for the country's civil aviation safety commission, CIAIAC, to examine the near miss and its causes. 

David Guillamon, spokesman for the Spanish air-traffic controller association, Aprocta, said the incident was a 'serious case', but said that - despite appearances -  there was 'no danger of a collision.'

Aerolineas Argentinas also insisted that nothing was amiss during the incident.

A spokesman said: 'Aerolineas Argentinas affirms there was never a situation of risk in the supposed incident registered on Saturday at Barcelona Airport between a Russian UTair plane and an Aerolineas Argentinas plane.

'A spokesman for the Spanish airports authority AENA stated the UTair landing could have taken place without any risk as both planes were in the places they should have been with sufficient distance between each other.' 

Safe landing: The Boeing 767 from Russian airline Utair lands after the near-miss at Barcelona airport

As the Boeing approached the runway, the Airbus had already taxied clear of the location on the way to its own runway for takeoff, he said.

The heart-stopping incident, which occurred on Saturday, was caught on camera by Miguel Angel, who posted the video to YouTube, where it has already been viewed more than one million times. 

Mr Angel, who has posted hundreds of plane videos online, said seeing the near-miss was 'one of the worst experiences I have ever had'. 

He said: 'An Utair Boeing 767-300 (VQ-BSX) incoming from Moscow as UT5187 and Aerolíneas Argentinas Airbus A340-300 (LV-FPV) were involved into what could be the bigger disaster of Barcelona Airport.

'The Utair 767 was about to land on Runway 02 while the Argentinas was crossing the runway.

'By the time Russian pilots sight Argentinas (they were taxiing to Holding point of RW25R for take-off) on runway while they were on final approach, they did their best making an impressive and close go around.

'After that incidence the plane landed safely on runway 02, and the Argentinas took-off heading Buenos Aires.' [sic]
