Sir Philip Green's Topshop and Topman business were today valued at a staggering £2 billion after the retail tycoon sold a 25 per cent stake in the fashion brands.

The entrepreneur’s Arcadia Group, which also owns Bhs, Burton and Dorothy Perkins, netted £500 million after agreeing to sell the Topshop stake to American private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners.

The high street magnate said the deal will help his group expand Topshop and Topman brands further across the US and internationally.

Expansion: The deal will help fund Sir Philip's planned expansion of the popular high-street brand internationally

Sir Philip Green is the 
multi-billionaire 'King of the High Street' who commutes to work by 
private jet from the tax haven of Monaco.

And
his tax affairs were brought into the spotlight in 2010 when he was 
appointed by David Cameron as a government spending tsar charged with 
finding Whitehall savings.

Sir Philip, who left school at 15 to go into business, lives in London hotels during the week.

But
his business empire is mostly owned in the name of his wife Tina 
(pictured together above), who lives in the tax haven, where Sir Philip 
spends his weekends. The couple moved there in 1998.

In the past, he has joked that the vast sums paid into his wife's bank account are 'housekeeping money'.

This set-up will have saved himself £125million in tax, experts have claimed.

He
remains a UK taxpayer because he spends more than 90 days a year here 
running his businesses but he ensured that when he bought Bhs in 2000 
and Arcadia in 2002, the transactions were in his wife's name.

Mrs
Green has long been Monaco based with their children Brandon and Chloe,
meaning she escapes the tax rules for citizens living in the UK.

There is nothing illegal in the set-up but he
arrangement is thought to have saved the couple tens of millions of 
pounds in tax over the years. He famously paid his family a £1.2billion 
dividend in 2005. Lady Tina was able to receive the dividend tax-free because she is an official resident of Monaco.

Asked 
about his wife's tax status he replied: 'My wife's not a tax exile - my 
family do not live in the United Kingdom, it's somewhat different.'

And
questioned over whether Britain would benefit from owners of British 
businesses paying all their taxes in the country, Sir Philip added: 'We 
do pay all our tax in Britain, I think we have paid over the last five 
years some £300-400 million in taxes on profits that have been made on 
our company.

'I'm a UK taxpayer, I work here every week, we employ 45,000 people in the UK and we have got a £500 million payroll.'

Topshop - popular with budget shoppers and fashionistas alike - has been steadily increasing its international footprint in recent years and has 615 franchised shops across 39 countries.

Sir Philip signalled a potential spending spree to come as he said the cash from the sale will remain in the Arcadia Group, leaving it debt-free and offering the 'flexibility to look at other opportunities'.

He added: 'This is a very exciting time for the Arcadia Group, with a clear strategy now in place for Topshop/Topman to become major global players.'

The £500million cash injection from the share issue, which waters down Green's controlling stake, will go straight into the company's coffers for expansion.

Sir Philip's business empire is mostly owned in the name of his wife Tina, who lives in Monaco - where he spends his weekends.

So had the family shares been sold this money would have gone into her pocket with little or no tax paid.

Green famously paid his family a £1.2billion 
dividend in 2005. Lady Tina was able to receive the dividend tax-free because she is an official resident of Monaco.

The deal follows months of talks with Leonard Green & Partners, which has a history of retail investments in the US, including organic food group Whole Foods Market, fashion chain J.Crew, Neiman Marcus luxury department stores and pet products retailer Petco.

In Arcadia's recent full-year figures, Sir Philip said international Topshop stores were performing well, with its fledgling Melbourne outlet on course for £15 million sales in its first year after record results.

Shops in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and Vancouver in Canada have also recorded strong opening performances.

But the wider Arcadia group saw like-for-like retail sales fall 3.2% in the year to August 25 as it endured "very challenging" high street trading.

The sales disappointment was offset by moves to sell less discounted stock, which helped improve margins and grow underlying full-year profit by 25% to £166.9 million from £133.1 million the previous year.

Trading since the summer also picked up, with comparable store sales up 0.7%, including VAT, in the 10 weeks of its new financial year.

Topshop and Topman have become one of the biggest successes on the UK high street, partly as a result of a lucrative collaboration with supermodel Kate Moss who designed her own clothing collection for the store.

The launch of her line in 2007 saw the biggest single day of trading Topshop.com had ever seen.

The chain has also been hailed for  its skill in spotting the latest fashion trends and quickly getting them on to  its shelves.

Ahead of the sale a friend of the tycoon said: ‘You would be wrong to suggest Sir Philip is going to use this deal to take cash out of the business. This is about investing in a big push for Topshop and Topman internationally.’

Prior to the announcement Sir Phillip was ranked with his family at number 17 on the Sunday Times rich list with an estimated fortune of £3.3billion.

Last month he signed up American 
reality TV stars the Kardashian sisters in an attempt to boost the 
fortunes of his Dorothy Perkins chain.

The entrepreneur recently criticised 
Britain’s battered retailers for feeling sorry for themselves, saying 
there was ‘no use moping about’ and they should ‘get on with it’.

But he has faced criticism himself over his tax arrangements.

Sir Philip, who employs 45,000 people through Arcadia, says he always pays his tax in full.

Topshop's recent success has been buoyed by the 
involvement of model Kate Moss who launched her own clothing collection 
in the store in 2007

Topshop started life in 1964 as Peter Robinson’s Top Shop, a fashion brand within the Sheffield branch of the Peter Robinson chain.

By the 1970s Topshop had become  a stand-alone store, and in 1994 it  settled into its permanent home, 214 Oxford Street.

Sir Philip is already in New York with his Topshop brand, and he opened two more flagship stores, in Chicago and Las Vegas, in September 2011 and March 2012 respectively.

He has a fourth store due to open in Los Angeles next spring.
