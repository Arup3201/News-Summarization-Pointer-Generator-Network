From having a cake fight and singing around a campfire, to getting a tattoo and covering a car in sticky notes, fans of Talia Castellano, who lost her fight with cancer this week, have been fulfilling the inspirational teenager's bucket list.

The 13-year-old, who grabbed the attention of the nation after appearing on the Ellen show last September, had 74 items on her bucket list, which included giving flowers to a stranger and going to a Justin Bieber concert.

The Castellano family had posted her bucket list on her Facebook page, which has more than half a million 'likes' five days before Talia died, and soon her fans were posting pictures of them fulfilling the teenager's dreams,according to ABC News.

'Talia is everywhere you look and we 
couldn't be more pleased. And we especially know she is loving all the attention' her family posted on the page the day after she died.

They added: 'Thank
 you for keeping her spirit alive and showing her family that her 
message and voice will continue to make an impact across the globe.'

Talia had attracted a large following thanks to her upbeat attitude to her neuroblastoma and leukemia diagnosis.

She posted make up tutorials on YouTube, and said she refused to wear a wig because it made her feel 'fake' and 'just not me'.

More than 759,110 people subscribed to her YouTube page to watch Talia's bubbly and expert tips.

'When I put on my make-up I feel like I can embrace those features that I really like about myself,' she explained last year.

'I feel if someone's looking at me, they're looking at my makeup, not looking at my bald head. I am just trying to make young girls, young adults, adults, anyone, feel beautiful by using makeup.'

Thanks to the online make up tutorials, Talia was able to achieve two of her bucket list wishes.

She was invited on the Ellen show, where she was made an honorary CoverGirl and presented with a professional shot advert by host Ellen DeGeneres,another representative of the cosmetics brand.

Earlier this year, Talia also fulfilled her dream of becoming a fashion designer as she collaborated on a line of clothing for teenagers called That Bald Chick with Los Angeles-based designer, Urbana Chappa.

Ms Chappa, who runs a womenswear label called Maison De Urbana, decided to help fulfill Talia's ambitions after hearing her inspirational story on the Ellen show last fall.

As Talia came to terms with her terminal disease, which was first diagnosed when she was seven-years-old, she found comfort in what she had been able to achieve in her short life.

'Having a YouTube channel, [inspiring] people and having people look up to me . . . the journey of having cancer was amazing. But every journey has an end,' she said.

It appears that her legacy will now live on in the thousands of people inspired by her.
