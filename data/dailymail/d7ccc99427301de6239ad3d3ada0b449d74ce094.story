A building with an invisible 'wall of death' has been blamed for the deaths of dozens of migrating geese who flew straight into it after mistaking it for the sky.

The pale grey-coloured wall on the end of The Sands apartment development in the seaside town of Scarborough, North Yorkshire, stands directly in the birds' flight path to the North Sea.

The colour of the paint means many Canadian geese have flown into the wall, breaking their necks and falling to the ground. The wall is now peppered with indentations made by the birds' beaks.

Birds have apparently struggled with the
building since it was built in 2008 and developers have put up LED lighting to
act as a deterrent.

But residents have claimed the building's lighting is ineffective and birds are still being killed by flying into the wall.

Dog walker Mary Dale, who spotted a lifeless bird at the foot of the wall last month, said: 'My husband and I saw it and thought what a shame as it was such a big, beautiful bird.

'We walk the dogs every day in that area and over the years we have seen quite a few that have ended up dead as a result of flying into the building.

'The morning we were there, the sky 
and the wall were more or less the same colour and I think that's what 
gets them. All it needs is something hanging over it to distract them, 
like a long flag.

'There
are lights at the top of the building but they are no good in the early
morning or dusk. I just think if it's happening again how many more 
are going to fly into it? Something needs to be done.'

Councillors have now voted to instigate the idea of drawing murals on the wall.  Local artist Alan Stuttle believes the cream facade could be transformed into public art.

He said: 'I love nature and wildlife and have painted in the fields and the moors for years.

'It's such a shame that so many birds
are being destroyed by hitting a brick wall, which can be easily 
rectified by a few colours.

'It
is crying out for a piece of art. I always think it looks like a big 
solid canvass. Perhaps it could be a project for young art students. 
Young people would have some brilliant ideas.'

Scarborough
wildlife rescuer Jim Ward said: 'My suggestion would be that with 
Canadian Geese being a bird that lives in estuaries and lakelands, I 
would paint a woodland scene on the side of the wall. The geese steer 
clear of those environments because they are too big and cumbersome.'

Escape
2 The Sands, which manages the £190,000 apartments, has previously 
said it was investigating a number of possible solutions to eliminate 
future incidents.
