Three men, including an 81 year old, have been arrested by police investigating a paedophile ring who drugged, raped and sold schoolgirls into prostitution.

They were held today after officers raided the Nanford Guest House in Oxford, in connection with Operation Bullfinch, which was set up to break-up gangs of abusers.

Seven members of a paedophile ring from 
the city are already facing long jail terms after being found guilty at the Old 
Bailey last month of a catalogue of offences, including conspiracy to 
rape, child prostitution and trafficking over an eight-year period.

They had showered vulnerable children from care homes or the streets with gifts and attention, before grooming them, abusing them and selling them on into prostitution around the country.

The three men arrested today also included a 48 year old and a 49 year old, who were taken away by police along with the 81-year-old suspect.

They were held on suspicion of 'being a landlord letting a premise for use as a brothel, causing or inciting child prostitution for gain and encouraging or assisting in an offence believing it will be committed, namely rape and causing child prostitution'.

A Thames Valley Police spokesman said: 'The warrant is in relation to information that came to light during the recent trial at the Old Bailey where evidence was heard that the guest house had been used to facilitate child sexual exploitation.'

The three men were all in custody this morning. The warrant was executed at the guest house under section 8 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act.

Officers also raided another property in Sunningwell, Oxford, police added.

Last month, two sets of brothers, Akhtar Dogar, 32, and Anjum Dogar, 31, and Mohammed Karrar, 38, and Bassam Karrar, 33, were convicted with Kamar Jamil, 27, Assad Hussain, 32, and Zeeshan Ahmed, 27.

They will be sentenced on June 26. Two
other defendants - Mohammed Hussain, 25, and a man who cannot be named 
for legal reasons - were cleared.

At
the end of the harrowing case, police and social workers apologised to 
the victims for failing to rescue them as it emerged that officers 
missed several chances to catch gang members before they were finally 
arrested.

Some victims 
relived their ordeals during the four-month trial, describing how they 
were groomed, beaten, betrayed and sold into prostitution around the 
country.

One was still 
so frightened of her attackers that she refused to give evidence for 
fear of reprisals. It was only after she was given legal advice that 
Girl D agreed to tell her story on a videolink from another room in the 
building.

She had been 
raped and prostituted at 11 by Mohammed Karrar, who bought her gifts and
showed her the first affection she had known.

Another victim, Girl A, complained of her plight to police on two occasions but no one was charged.

A
care home manager refused to pay her taxi fare when she returned after 
absconding. The then 14-year-old was driven back to Oxford to be raped.

The carer was later sacked and the privately run home where girls were placed by Oxford County Council was closed down.

The
girls had been put into care because their behaviour was out of control
and for their own protection. Time after time, they disappeared from 
children’s homes and were caught with older men by police, but the 
exploitation continued.

The six girls said they had been victims of men in the Cowley area of Oxford while aged between 11 and 15.

The
gang was finally arrested after police and social services got together
to form Operation Bullfinch. By speaking to complainants and looking at
their histories, they realised they were dealing with an organised 
grooming gang.

Girls 
were either threatened that they or their families would be harmed, or 
brainwashed into thinking they were betraying their lover if they talked
to police.

The trial 
followed the jailing last year of men in Rochdale for abusing vulnerable
girls, another case where chances to stop the gang were missed.

Earlier
this year the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Crown 
Prosecution Service announced new measures to improve their response to 
sexual offending, particularly involving children.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
