Astonished: Sir Philip Hampton has revealed the 'completely out of body experiences' he has had negotiating RBS bankers' pay packages

Super-rich bankers at Royal Bank of Scotland earning £4million a year are ‘absolutely outraged’ they do not earn even more money, the chairman admitted yesterday.

Sir Philip Hampton revealed the ‘completely out of body experiences’ he has had negotiating people’s pay packages at the State-owned bank with people who occupy a ‘different world.’

RBS was rescued by the taxpayer in a £45billion bailout in 2008, and the State still controls an 81 per cent stake.

The former boss Fred Goodwin was subsequently stripped of his knighthood.

Speaking in London yesterday, Sir Philip expressed his horror at the ruthless pay demands made by some RBS staff.

He recalled one meeting when a man was complaining bitterly that he only earned £4million a year when a rival at another bank earned £6million for doing the same job.

He said: ‘I can tell you I’ve had some completely out of body experiences in recent years where I was talking to somebody about potentially getting a £4million pay package.

‘And outrage coming across the table from the other side because they know that somebody doing a comparable job at another bank is getting £6million.

‘And this is absolutely outrageous to them. That somebody is getting 50 per cent more.’

Sir Philip, who earns a basic salary of £750,000 a year, said many bankers think it is ‘very, very, very unfair that they are only left with £4million to rub along with.’

Asked how he had responded to this man’s demand, Sir Philip said he was ‘actually rather surprised.’

He added: ‘It is part of the different world that can be inhabited. Intellectually it is sort of right, isn’t it? I am paid a third less for doing the same job.

‘But is it reasonable? Not many people would say that it is.’

The unnamed man is not on the bank’s board, and is likely to be a senior trader whose pay does not have to be disclosed by the bank. He has subsequently left the firm.

Despite their large pay packages, Sir Philip said he regularly receives emails from staff at RBS who are complaining that they do not earn enough money.

The bank’s own figures show the huge pay packages enjoyed by hundreds of its staff, while cashiers in branches and thousands of staff at head office earn far more modest salaries.

Overall, it has 368 key staff, known as ‘code staff’, who earn an average package of £700,000 each, while 93 workers were paid more than £1million last year.

Speaking at a conference organised by the High Pay Centre, the independent think-tank, he said: ‘I get people sending me emails saying: "My bonus is only going to be X".

‘That is a fraction of what I’m worth, and can you have a word in the right places?’’

Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said the current pay regime in Britain is ‘obscene and unfair’.

She said: ‘A big bonus is being given to any boss with a pulse currently.’

Robert Talbut, chairman of the Association of British Insurers’ investment committee, said: ‘One of the biggest problems that we actually have is that people who have turned in a reasonable performance are rewarded far too much.’
