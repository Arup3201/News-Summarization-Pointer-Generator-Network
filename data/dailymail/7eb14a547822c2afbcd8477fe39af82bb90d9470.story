Rats that can be taught to lie down on command, ostriches that can be ridden by actors and the building of two £178,000 life-size spaceships.

These are just a smattering of the incredible suggestions put forward at production meetings in 1976 a year ahead of the making of the first Star Wars film a year later.

Revealing notes from discussions between key figures on January
 13, January 26 and February 13
shine a light on the staggering level of planning that was required to 
produce the ground-breaking sci-fi movie which cost a reported 
$11million to make in 1977– around £53million in today’s money.

Details:
 This intriguing note illustrates the breadth of planning detail 
required ahead of the multi-million dollar film

Big job: The note reveals that jawas, pictured left, - short rodent-like natives of Luke Skywalker's home planet of 
tatooine - are to be cast on location, two Tuscan raiders, known as Sand
 People are needed and the man behind it all Star Wars director George Lucas, right

The minutes of the meetings also illustrate the extraordinary level of detail director George Lucas and his team went to in order to bring to life the imaginary world in a ‘galaxy far, far away’.

Attending the meeting were, among others, Hollywood producer Gary Kurtz, and legendary special effects man John Stears credited with creating the Jedi light sabres and James Bond’s legendary Aston Martin DB5.

One page records set lists 227 to 250 including interiors of the Death Star, externals of a pirate starship and a prison cell and garbage room on the planet of Alderaan.

Other notes illustrate the huge undertaking involved in creating life-size X-Wing and Y-Wing fighter ships at a cost of £27,000 each or roughly £178,000 in today’s money.

Iconic: The full-scale model of the X-Wing fighter used in the Star Wars films. Produced in England for £178,000

Huge
 undertaking: This letter details the work involved in creating the 
Y-Wing fighter ship on location in England. It says steel will be used 
in the construction, with the ship being made in three parts to ensure 
it can be transported and constructed more easily on site

Expensive
 business: The estiimated cost of designing, building and transporting 
the Y-fighter ship is quoted at £27,000 plus VAT in 1976, taking into account inflation that equates around £178,470 today

Tight deadlines: This is the letter that confirmed the final look of Luke's X-Wing fighter. A full-size aircraft was to be built in just a few months at a cost of £178,000

Challenge:
 This note from International Engineering Services confirms that the 
company is willing to build the iconic X-Wing fighter and details the 
necessary specifications

Other extracts discuss the possibility of using animals in the production. Under the heading ‘Live Animals’ it is recorded that ‘we are now searching for a source for ostriches which can be ridden’.

Rats are put forward as possible ‘actors’ for the banther creatures with John Stears saying they could be taught to lie down on command. The note also states that ‘Gary Kurtz suggested giving rats injections.

'Bruce Sharman thought stuffed ones might be a good idea. John Barry enquired how long from babies to adults for training rats.’

Working
 with animals: This note references an unsuccessful mission by John 
Holmes to find live animals and efforts to source ostriches that can be 
ridden

Ostrich? A screen grab from Star Wars. The production notes suggest that ostriches could be used to play the parts

Under
 pressure: Special effects expert John Stears says the method
 chosen for creating the robot R2D2 'is viable'. It also records 
producer Gary Kurtz suggestion of using rodents to create the banthers 
with John Stears suggesting he could teach them to lie down. An ostrich 
is also put forward as a possible prop

Other issues raised include a problem with gold robot C3PO’s (minuted as 'Threepio’) right arm and plans to test ‘light swords’ later to be known as light sabres.

These extremely rare Star Wars production notes provide a window into the behind the scenes planning for the film and it is thought that only creator George Lucas has another copy.

Now the extraordinary collection, including the X-Wing delivery invoice, will go up for auction to a global fan base at the Greenwich Auction Partnership tomorrow.

They are set to go under the hammer for a starting price of £2,000 but such is their rarity they could fetch far more.

The fascinating extracts cover a wide range of topics from travel arrangements to Tunisia to ideas for what R2D2 should look like.

Massive
 budget: This note talks about 'laser swords' later to be renamed as the 
iconic light sabres. Other mentions of note include Luke Skywalker's 
legendary land speeder on which he hovered across tatooine and the need 
for two versions of R2D2 - a mechanical one and an actor controlled one

So much to think about: R2D2 left, who was played by Kenny Baker and right one of the locations chosen to film Star Wars

Logistics:
 The number of locations required is mind boggling. Outdoor sets range 
from a power station to a cave dwelling with enormous studio sets 
including a Masasi Temple and a Star Destroyer control room

Referring to the iconic Death Star end scene some surprising problems are flagged up and it appears that a humble Datsun car was to be transformed into an intergalactic fighter.

The note reads: 'John Stears bought a model Datsun car to show the meeting. Gary Kurtz said that one model of the size of the Datsun would be needed and three smaller ones (for the ‘Death Star’ sequence) would be needed, and that these should move fast in comparison to other things in the shot.'

Costs continue to be a factor as the minutes reveal the team plan to decide whether to use a massive RAF Hercules or a BA Vanguard to get equipment to Tunisia, the Hercules was listed at £9,000 just one way. 

Spaceship: A Datsun car like this one was sourced to be a spaceship in the scene with the Death Star

Other world: The creation of the Death Star proved to be a huge undertaking, as did the many interior sets required

Creating
 another world: The set list is almost unending including a pirate 
starship, an imperial fighter cockpit and several different views of the
 Death Star

John Barry, the legendary British set designer, who died of meningitis during the making of the second film, is also mentioned: 'John Barry stated that the ‘robot meeting’ was successful and that the five robots are coming along O.K.

‘George Lucas is now happy with ‘Threepio’.'

Part of the file mentions how the team encountered issues with a problem with C- 3PO’s elbows, saying John Barry is unhappy with how they work.

Robert Dodd, owner of the Greenwich Auction Partnership, said: 'I am positive there isn’t another collection of these anywhere, they would have been such a disposable thing. The only guy who might have a copy of these is George Lucas.

'I’m putting them in for between £2- 2,500, but a serious collector might pay absolutely anything. The sky’s the limit.'

The collectors item has already attracted a huge amount of attention from Star Wars lovers all over the country, and would be sure to cheer up any fan feeling a little on the Dark-side.

Making progress: This enlightening note gives an update on the progress of the production including plans for testing of the famous 'laser swords' or light sabres

Bomber: The 'Why' Wing rebel alliance bomber spaceship which was built alongside the full scale X-Wing ship in England

Dreamers: Special effects man John Stears, left, who is credited with inventing the light sabre and producer Gary Kurtz, right

Transportation: This note talks about the cost of using a Hercules airfreighter as against a British Airways Vanguard. Details of revealing a couple of hands and arms from the cloaks of dead jawas are mentioned as well as 12 extra costumes and eye pieces

Testing times: In addition to the vast array of props required bits of numerous technical kit and testing was required

Robot issues: This note reveals that there were problems with the air conditioning unit within C3PO's suit and that Luke and his auntie and uncle should have a deeper than normal tan with Ben Kenobi having a 'leathery look'

Timings: This note talks about the logistics of getting the right props in the right places at the right times such as Luke's speeder and interesting that ten different versions of R2D2 would be required

Famous figures: Those attending the crucial meeting on Friday, February 13th, 1976, included legendary producer Gary Kurtz and special effects man John Stears

Pulling out all the stops: A 4-wheel drive vehicle could be acquired from the Tunisian Army to move palm trees

Options for R2D2: This note from a meeting on January 23rd, 1976, talks about a second model for R2D2, Jack Purvis - the partner of actor Kenny Baker. It also talks about the requirement of three model Datsun cars for the Death Star sequence which would move 'fast' in comparison with the other things in the shot

Getting closer: George Lucas is reportedly 'happy' with the look of 'Threepio' and that the Land Speeder would be ready by February 2
