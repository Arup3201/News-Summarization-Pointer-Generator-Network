IT MUST have seemed like a smart way to travel first class without paying for the privilege.

But three friends were caught out after an eagle-eyed rail official spotted a forged ticket.

Police were called and discovered that they had been involved in forging and using first class rail tickets and railway car park passes.

Old tickets had been scanned on to a computer and the date changed.

Their scam involved copying a first class monthly season ticket from Southampton to London Waterloo worth £849.50 and a monthly railway car park ticket costing £130.

The three previously well-respected men – Neil Stantiall, construction firm boss John McInally and building worker Mark Batt – have now been given suspended jail sentences for their part in the fraud, which involved dodging more than £2,000 of rail fares and parking fees.

Judge Susan Evans QC told them: ‘You were all confident you were too clever to get caught out and you had an arrogant disregard for the basic qualities of honesty and morality.’

She said the men had caused  the railway company a ‘significant loss’, leading to increased prices  for everyone.

‘This was not just an error of judgment, this was serious dishonesty,’ the judge said.

Construction worker Batt (left) admitted conspiring to commit fraud after 'wife racked up £20,000 in credit card debt'.  Construction company boss McInally  (right) said he was 'extremely ashamed'

‘You are all intelligent individuals 
with responsible jobs. You have had opportunities in life that many have
not been fortunate to have.’

Southampton
Crown Court heard that a rail community officer uncovered the swindle 
in July last year when he spotted a fake parking ticket on the dashboard
of McInally’s Citroen Xsara at Southampton Airport Parkway. Unlike 
genuine tickets, it was blank on the back.

Police
stopped McInally, 46, as he left the car park and recovered three more 
fake monthly parking tickets and a first class monthly season ticket.

After reading text messages on his phone, officers arrested  Stantiall, 40, and Batt, 34, who is McInally’s brother-in-law.

The
texts showed Stantiall made the counterfeit tickets. Although none was 
found at his home in Whiteley, Hampshire, the court heard ‘it was clear 
he was responsible for supplying the tickets and had received at least 
some money for it’.

A first class monthly rail season ticket was found at Batt’s home in Southampton.

McInally,
of Southampton, runs a construction firm in London employing 50. He 
knew Stantiall through work and from travelling to the capital on the 
train. Batt also worked in London.

The men admitted conspiring  to commit fraud by false representation.

Stantiall was given 16 weeks in prison, suspended for two years, and 250 hours of unpaid work.

McInally
got 12 weeks in prison, suspended for two years, and 200 hours of 
unpaid work. Batt was given ten weeks in prison suspended for two years,
and 180 hours of unpaid work.

McInally
and Batt were ordered to repay the £2,219 that was defrauded, while all
three were told to share £1,500 court costs. McInally’s barrister, Leah
Dillon, described him as a family man who does  charity work. He was 
‘extremely ashamed’ of taking the opportunity to save some money.

Alistair
Wright, defending Stantiall, said his client stooped to the fraud after
his wife lost her job. Batt’s barrister, Robert Bryan, said his  client
had been left with financial problems after his wife ran up £20,000 in 
credit card debts and walked out on him.

Detective
Constable Phil James, of the British Transport Police, said: ‘We will 
continue to work closely with rail companies to ensure that those who 
seek to make financial gain in this way are brought to justice.

‘I
hope this strong sentence sends a clear message that the police and the
courts will not tolerate this sort of fraudulent activity.’
