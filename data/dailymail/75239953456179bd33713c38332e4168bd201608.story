Hong Kong police moved in to clear barricades from pro-democracy protest zones today, in a sign of authorities' growing impatience as the student-led demonstrations continue into their third week.

Appearing to use a strategy of chipping away at the three main protest zones, hundreds of police fanned out in the early hours to take down barriers the protesters had erected overnight.

Officers used electric saws and bolt cutters to take down bamboo scaffolding built in the Admiralty area after a mob of masked men stormed some of the barricades the day before. The barricades have choked off traffic in Hong Kong's key business districts for more than two weeks.

A few dozen protesters who sat guarding one entrance to the main occupied zone after the police came were exhausted but defiant.

'I'm feeling a bit lost. There is no dialogue with the government, and the truth is we are affecting people's lives. But we can't bear to leave without getting any results,' said Mark Li, a 21-year-old college student.

Mr Li and his friends said they were not afraid of a crackdown but were weary of police tactics to weaken their movement. 'I just hope we can keep fighting in the long term. It won't end so quickly - it's just a stalemate at the moment,' said Jason Wong, 19.

Police used sledgehammers to smash concrete used by protesters to secure the barriers to the road. They dismantled structures of plywood, rubbish bins, wooden pallets and other objects blocking the road, which runs parallel to a major highway that has become the protesters' main camp.

Police also cleared out protesters' tents and took down other makeshift barricades of plywood, trash cans and items collected by demonstrators to block a busy road on the periphery of the main protest zone in the former British colony.

Police negotiated with one last protester - who said he had an injured leg - to leave his tent.

The bamboo and tents were scooped up into the back of a dump truck while the barricades and other safety barriers were piled into trucks and vans.

Hundreds of other officers held back protesters and bystanders watching the scene in front of the upscale Pacific Place shopping mall near the heart of the city's financial district. 

Some protesters chanted, 'Triads!' - a reference to allegations vehemently denied by police that they have been working with organized crime gangs.

Before dawn, when protesters' numbers are fewest, police also removed metal barricades from another protest camp on a road in the nearby Causeway Bay shopping area to free up a lane for traffic.

By gradually reducing the protest areas from the edges and acting during the quiet morning hours, police appear to want to avoid the sort of combative confrontation that backfired two weeks ago, when the street protests started.

Then they went in with tear gas and pepper spray in an abortive attempt to clear the streets that caused international outcry.

Police spokesman Steve Hui said officers will continue to take down barriers set up by protesters. He said 23 men were arrested in yesterday's violent clashes, when masked men and taxi drivers led a crowd of several hundred who tried to rush the protest zone.

The protesters want China's government to drop plans for a pro-Beijing committee to screen candidates in the territory's first direct elections, promised for 2017.

They also demand that Hong Kong's deeply unpopular Beijing-backed leader, Leung Chun-ying, resign.

Proposed talks between the two sides last Friday were called off by the city government, which said a constructive outcome was unlikely given their sharp differences.

Mr Leung has said there is 'almost zero chance' that China's central government will change its rules for the 2017 election.

Defences: The bamboo barricades were only put up by demonstrators in Admiralty district last night after an attack by masked men

Determined: Although their numbers have dwindled from the protest peak, many demonstrators say they will fight to the end

The Beijing government is eager to end the protests to avoid encouraging activists and others on the mainland seen as a threat to the Communist Party's monopoly on power.

State media in mainland China has downplayed the crisis. In its noon report today, state broadcaster CCTV carried images of barricades being dismantled and street interviews with residents cheering the reopening of roads, complaining about the loss of business, and chiding the students for being naive and lacking life experience.

At the main protest zone outside Hong Kong's government headquarters, a tent city has sprung up as dozens of demonstrators camp out to defend the highway they have taken over. Many said they will not budge.

'No one knows how long this will last. I'm not afraid of the police and I will fight to the end,' said Alan Yip, 24, who quit his job to join the movement. 'If they come in here I will sit down and let them take me away.'
