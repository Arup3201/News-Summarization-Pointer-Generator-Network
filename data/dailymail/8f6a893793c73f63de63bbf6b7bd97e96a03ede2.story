Britain's greedy energy firms were today accused by the government of treating their customers like 'cash cows' which can be 'squeezed' to increase profits.

Energy Secretary Ed Davey used a speech today to point the finger at power bosses for behaving as badly as disgraced banker Fred ‘the Shred’ Goodwin, who presided over the collapse of RBS.

As the industry accused the minister of 'tit for tat insults', EDF announced rises 3.9 per cent amid reports E.ON will push up prices by 6.6 per cent, much lower than the hikes of up to 10 per cent imposed by the rest of the Big Six.

How bills will soar

Mr Davey used a speech to the energy industry's annual conference to launch the most outspoken attack so 
far on bosses from the so-called Big Six of EDF, nPower, British Gas, 
Scottish Power, SSE and E.ON.

He accused them of greed for ramping
up prices for consumers while wholesale prices are barely increasing.

E.ON is expected to raise its charges by 6.6 per cent this month, becoming the fifth of the top six energy firms to increase fees by more than twice the rate of inflation, according to the Telegraph.

About four million homes will be hit by the rise, with customers on non-fixed tariffs paying an extra £90 per year.

Meanwhile, EDF announced its bills will go up by just 3.9 per cent, much lower than the crippling rises announced by the rest of the Big Six.

But it appeared to threaten the government that if it fails to cut green levies it will have to 'review' its prices, paving the way for another increase.

Squeeze: Energy Secretary Ed Davey warned power firms not to hike bills just to maximise profits

ScottishPower bills are going up by 9 per cent, Npower announced a 10.4 per cent price hike, British Gas a 9.2 per cent rise and Scottish & Southern Energy an 8.2 per cent increase.

Energy regulator Ofgem says the amount of profit raised from bills has doubled in a year, while the wholesale costs of gas and electricity have remained almost unchanged.

Tom Lyon, energy expert at uSwitch.com, said:

'Any winter price rise is a blow to consumers as it makes the struggle to afford to stay warm that little bit harder.

'However, EDF Energy is to be applauded for the stance it is taking by factoring in the potential reduction on green levies into its calculations.

'This means that customers will know upfront that they will benefit from any step the Government takes to reduce the impact of 'hidden' taxes on bills. 

'More importantly it also challenges the Government to put its money where its mouth is and to make good its pledges on affordability.'

In his speech Mr Davey conceded that power firms have to make profits to invest in infrastructure.

But he told industry umbrella group Energy UK, he will warn: 'Those profits cannot come at the expense of the elderly, the vulnerable and the poorest in our society.

'Customers are not just cash cows to be squeezed in the pursuit of a higher return for shareholders.

'And frankly the latest round of bill rises have not been fully and openly justified.

'When people see energy bills rising way above inflation, year on year, you can understand the anger and frustration this causes.

'People fear shareholder interests are being put in front of the needs of families and the fuel poor.'

Money to burn... E.ON will raise its charges by 6.6 per cent this month, becoming the fifth of the top six energy firms to increase prices

The announcement by French-owned power firm EDF that its prices will rise by just 3.9 per cent sparked immediate questions about why other firms' increase are more than twice as high.

The Big Six have argued that rising wholesale costs and green levies mean they have no choice but to increase bills.

ScottishPower bills are going up by 9 
per cent, Npower announced a 10.4 per cent price hike, British Gas a 9.2
per cent rise and Scottish & Southern Energy an 8.2 per cent 
increase.

But EDF chief executive Vincent de Rivaz said: 'The best way to help customers is for us to keep our prices as low as possible.

'I know that price rises are always unwelcome, but we have taken the first step to show what can be done if rising costs are tackled head-on.'

The lower rise was welcomed by campaign groups.

Richard Lloyd, executive director of Which?, said: 'While any increase is bad news for hard-pressed consumers, today's announcement will make people question why other major suppliers have hit their customers so much harder.

'People want to hear more than just tough talk from the politicians - they want to see tough new action to fix our broken energy market, not tinkering at the edges while consumers grapple with the rising cost of living.'

Mr Davey said the Government is looking at how it could reduce the impact of its policies on bills.

'But
our commitment must be matched by a commitment in industry to open up 
your books and set out exactly how you are bearing down on your own 
costs to make bills as low as possible.

'The
industry must be much more transparent and Ofgem will have our full 
support to introduce whatever regulations are necessary to deliver that 
greater transparency.'

David Cameron and Nick Clegg are holding talks this week on how to remove green levies from energy bills which add more than £100 to costs for every customer.

It is thought the Energy Companies Obligation, which raises money to pay for insulation and other efficiency measures, will be funded from general taxation instead.

Ministers are desperate to find a way to
save at least £60-a-year from bills, in order to boast that they have 
cut costs by more than the £120 over 20 months which Labour leader Ed 
Miliband claims his bills freeze would save.

Energy UK said 95 per cent of rising costs were out of the hands of the industry.

And it hit back at Mr Davey's outspoken criticism of their business practices.

A spokesman said: 'The energy industry is already working hard to ensure everyone can keep the lights on and stay warm this winter.

'The best way to do this is for everyone to work together which is why this tit for tat Punch and Judy show of insults is so unproductive.

'The energy industry is vital to the UK. It is  a major employer, a serious investor and a significant taxpayer.'

Speaking at today's conference, Energy UK's chief executive Angela Knight said the industry had a problem of trust as a result of increases in bills.

'We have got a problem - an image problem, a reputational problem, a trust problem,' she said.

'Trust is hard to gain and it's easy to lose.

'Energy bills have risen for well-known reasons, reasons that the industry has made quite clear.'

Ms Knight defended the profits made by energy firms, saying: 'Profitability is a good thing, it's not a bad thing.

'That profitability maintains the industry and, when it pays dividends, it pays for pensions as well.'

Caroline Flint, Labour's shadow energy secretary, said: 'David Cameron's out of touch Government is offering nothing to the millions of families faced with rising energy bills and a cost-of-living crisis.

'Ed Davey and the Lib Dems had a chance to support Labour's energy bill freeze but have chosen instead to side with the Tories and the energy companies. It just goes to show you can't trust a word they say.'
