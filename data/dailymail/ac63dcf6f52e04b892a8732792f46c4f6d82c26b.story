She was sporting a stunning sapphire and diamond ring on her wedding finger today, but Elizabeth Hurley and Shane Warne chose not to comment on the reports he had popped the question when they appeared together at the Dunhill tournament today.

Now, the couple have confirmed their engagement by thanking fans for their well wishes over their Twitter accounts.

'Thanks for all your congratulations,' Hurley tweeted, adding a picture of the couple which she said was taken just before the dinner last night at St Andrews where Warne, 42, proposed.

Surprise! Elizabeth Hurley and her soon-to-be fiance Shane Warne pictured last night before his proposal at the Dunhill dinner in St Andrews

The Estée Lauder model presumably had no idea that her boyfriend of ten months was about to ask her to marry him as they posed happily for a picture inside the exclusive Old Course Hotel.

Miss Hurley was wearing a strapless nude bandage dress and heavy smokey eye-make-up while the Australian cricketer wore a sharp suit and purple tie.

The sportsman grinned mischievously at the camera, clearly excited about his plan.

And we all know what Elizabeth's answer was to be, as she flashed her stunning ring as she cheered her new fiance on at the tournament again today.

Well wishes: Both Elizabeth and Shane tweeted their thanks to fans for their congratulations

The happy couple: Newly-engaged Elizabeth Hurley and Shane Warne posed for photos alongside her nine-year-old son Damien at the Alfred Dunhill Links championship this afternoon

Bling: Hurley proudly flashed her sapphire and diamond engagement ring

The stunning ring, which features a huge square sapphire and two diamonds on either side, looked right at home on Hurley's left hand.

The Estée Lauder model, 45, went for a casual look in a pair of navy jogging bottoms, jumper and scarf as she took to the golf course with Warne, who opted for a baby blue jumper and beige trousers.

Damien, nine, clutched on to his mother's arm as he posed up for a photo with Hurley and Warne, who will soon be his stepfather.

Warne is believed to have proposed in a restaurant at the exclusive Old Course Hotel in St Andrews following a romantic meal.

Warne, 42, made the declaration in 
front of stunned VIP guests in the hotel’s fine dining Road Hole 
Restaurant, sources said.

The source said: ‘Shane proposed over
dinner and it was fairly public, not a private affair.

'It was a VIP 
crowd in there this evening. It was residents only, including Dunhill 
past players.

‘He didn’t get down on one knee, but when it was announced the other guests in the restaurant stood up and applauded.

‘Everyone there was absolutely delighted.’

A spokesman for the Scottish hotel said they were unable to comment on the news.

Liz Hurley's impressive sapphire engagement ring (right) bears more than a passing resemblance to the one Prince Charles gave to Princess Diana in 1981, pictured left.

That 12-carat oval sapphire, surrounded by a cluster of 14 diamonds, cost £28,500 from Garrard of Mayfair at the time. 

It was, of course, presented to Kate Middleton by Prince William on their engagement in November last year. Jewellers have reported a rush for similar-looking rings ever since.

But sapphire has long been a popular choice for engagement rings as it has come to symbolise love, truth and commitment.

In the 12th Century, crusaders would present their wives with sapphire rings to test their fidelity, believing the vivid colour would fade if a woman was unfaithful.

The Old Course Hotel has 144 lavish bedrooms and suites, many of them designed by top French designer Jacques Garcia.

Popular with celebrities who visit St 
Andrews, the hotel boasts on its website that its rooms have ‘picture 
postcard views’ of the course.

Both avid Twitter users, Mr Warne’s 
last tweet to Miss Hurley before asking for her hand read: ‘Let’s play 
the Dunhill together next year - you up for it?

A spokesman for the couple was unavailable today.

Warne has undergone a radical 
physical transformation in recent months though he has has denied going 
under the knife He says his youthful look is down to love and his 
smoother skin is thanks to the help of Hurley.
