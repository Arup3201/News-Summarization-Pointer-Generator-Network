Birmingham Bears have pulled off a major coup for the NatWest T20 Blast with the signing of New Zealand's powerhouse captain Brendon McCullum.

The reigning champions will be able to call on the services of the explosive 33-year-old batsman for their final seven matches of this year's competition.

McCullum will link up with the Bears once New Zealand's tour of England has been concluded and his first game is scheduled to be against Lancashire Lightning on June 26 at Old Trafford.

He will arrive on these shores with a fearsome reputation after playing a starring role at the top of the order in the Black Caps' run to the World Cup final.

Among his four half-centuries in nine matches for the co-hosts was a destructive 77 off just 25 balls against England in Wellington.

Dougie Brown, Birmingham Bears director of cricket, said: 'Brendon's dynamic performances in the ICC Cricket World Cup have demonstrated once again exactly why he is one of the most feared batsmen in the game.

'Securing his availability for our last seven games has to make him one of the biggest overseas player signings in the competition's history.

'His power at the top of the order and experience of playing in big matches are great assets to bolster our already strong squad as we look to win through to the quarter-finals and defend our NatWest T20 Blast title.'

McCullum is the leading run scorer in the history of T20 internationals, with 2,105 at an average over 35, with two centuries.

He said: 'The Birmingham Bears had a great season last year, including winning the NatWest T20 Blast, and hopefully I can make a big contribution and ensure that we can progress in the tournament.

'Edgbaston is a fantastic ground to play at and hopefully it will be rocking for the big Friday night matches. I'm really excited about becoming a Bear and the challenge ahead.'

Elsewhere, Leicestershire have signed Ireland’s big-hitting all-rounder Kevin O’Brien for the T20 Blast but Lancashire’s plans for the new season have been rocked by seamer Peter Siddle’s inclusion in Australia’s Test squad.
