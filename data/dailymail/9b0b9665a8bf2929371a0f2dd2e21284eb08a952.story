These eerie images show the inside of Building 25 at Creedmoor Psychiatric Center in Queens, New York once a haven for the city’s cast-out mentally ill which has been left abandoned for nearly 40 years.

Creedmoor was founded in 1912 as the Farm Colony of Brooklyn State Hospital, a psychiatric ward like hundreds of others opened at the turn of the century to house and rehabilitate those people ill-equipped to function on their own. 

Before medical advancements helped treat people suffering from psychosis and schizophrenia, the preferred option was to send them away to live in farm colonies such as Creedmoor where it was believed the fresh air and nature could help ease their suffering.

As the 20th century progressed and the population grew such asylums became overrun with patients and living conditions often deteriorated. 

By 1960, Creedmoor’s population swelled from 150 in 1918 to over 7,000.

Patient abuse and neglect was not uncommon and Creedmoor State Hospital was no different. 

Conditions came under scrutiny in the 1940s due to an outbreak of dysentery that resulted from unsanitary living conditions in the wards.

By 1974 the hospital had spiraled completely out of control and an investigation was prompted after a series of crimes including rapes, assaults, a riot and attempted murder.

One of its more notorious patients was former NYPD officer Robert Torsney, who was committed there from December, 1977-June, 1979 after being found not guilty by insanity in the 1976 murder of then 15-year-old Randolph Evans in Brooklyn.

Creedmoor continues to operate today, but housing only a few hundred patients as advancements in treatment for the mentally ill have proved a much more effective way of dealing.

While many of the buildings have been sold off, Building 25 stands as a testament to a bygone era.

Up until the 1970s the building was an active ward and today it retains many mementos from its traumatic past as a treatment center for the mentally ill. 

Room upon room features peeling paint, dusty furniture and piles of litter. Some rooms include paintings of religious imagery - perhaps the work of patients. 

Upstairs on the fourth floor things have taken a turn for the grotesque as huge mounds of pigeon excrement have build-up below spots popular with the birds.

Despite the disgusting squalor, AbandonedNYC who visited the site reports seeing recent newspapers and other clues that some people are still regularly visiting this eerie monument to the past.
