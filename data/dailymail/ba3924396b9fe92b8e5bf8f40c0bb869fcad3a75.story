Eoin Morgan made a cameo appearance for Sydney Thunder in his first outing since his appointment as England one-day captain, contributing an unbeaten 12 in their resounding 56-run victory over Brisbane Heat in the Big Bash League.

The Middlesex batsman was handed the national team role on Saturday, replacing Alastair Cook ahead of the tri-series against Australia and India and the World Cup, which begins in February.

Morgan was named as England captain last week and helped Sydney Thunder to victory in the Big Bash

Andrew Flintoff was making his Big Bash debut for Brisbane but it was a performance to forget as the former England all-rounder conceded 25 runs in the two overs he bowled and was then dismissed for a duck.

Flintoff did not have any joy with the ball conceding 25 runs off his two overs

Michael Hussey (96) and Jacques Kallis (97 not out) had already done the leg work for Sydney in an opening partnership of 160 before Morgan arrived at the crease for the final three overs, in which he faced five balls and smashed a four and a six.

That left Brisbane chasing a victory target of 209, but they were unable to rise to the challenge and were skittled out for 152 within 18 overs.
