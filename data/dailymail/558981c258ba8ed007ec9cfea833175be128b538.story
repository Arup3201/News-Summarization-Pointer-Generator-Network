With its beautifully decorated hall, stunning array of rooms and 1,100 acres of land, this Tudor-style mansion built exactly 100 years ago is currently on the market for a cool £11m.

But legend has it the property fell into the hands of the current owner's family more than 140 years ago after it was won in a game of cards.

The current form of the mansion on the Hamptworth Lodge Estate, situated within the New Forest National Park, in Wiltshire, was designed by Tudor expert Harold Moffat between 1910 and 1913 after he inherited it in 1884.

The estate itself has been in the same 
family however since 1870, when it fell into the hands of the 
great-great uncle to the current owners.

Mansion: The Hamptworth Estate has been in the hands of the same family since 1870, but was rebuilt between 1910 and 1913

Impressive: The Great Hall features the sister organ to the one at Salisbury Cathedral

Detailed: The mansion was designed in a Jacobean style by Tudor expert Harold Moffat

James Grillo, head of the country house department at estate agents Chesterton Humberts, said: 'The family who own it now, legend has it that it was won in a game of cards.'

Oxford professor Mr Moffat, who at the time was one of the foremost world-renowned experts in Tudor furniture, developed the site after it was passed on to him.

Mr Grillo said: 'He already owned another estate in Herefordshire but when he inherited this estate he knocked down the original house and built a Tudor mansion to show off his collection of Tudor furniture.

'The building was completed in 1913 - it is 100 years old this year.

'It is a Tudor-style house to look at in every way but it was actually an Edwardian build.'

Originally one of the original Royal 
Hunting Lodges in the New Forest, the estate is currently being sold as 
four separate lots, or altogether for a total of £11m.

Well-kept: The estate features some fantastically-kept gardens, although there has been the odd ghostly-sighting in the grounds as well

Heritage: The estate itself has been in the same family since 1870, when it fell into the hands of the great-great uncle to the current owners

Legend: According to legend the family won the estate in a game of cards

Mr Grillo said: 'The original house had evolved and was enlarged many times and our client's forebears knocked down a Georgian house which was there and replaced it with this Edwardian build in the Tudor style.

'Because Mr Moffat was one of the foremost experts in Tudor furniture it is fantastically detailed as far as the timber work and structure is concerned.

'He took himself off to become a carpenter with a boat builder on the Thames and he became a master craftsmen in his own right.

'He oversaw and did a lot of building himself.

Historic: The estate itself can be traced back to at least the 11th century

Tradition: Each room is designed in a Jacobean-style, despite the fact it was only built 100 years ago

Ghostly encounters: The house is believed to be haunted, according to the current owners

'So you have an incredibly detailed timber building. At the end of each beam there are little carvings such as lizards or snakes or little dragon flies which identify which carpenter made that beam, and that's how it would have been in Tudor times.'

Other features in the mansion include the organ in the Great Hall, which is in fact the sister organ to one in Salisbury Cathedral, while a small detail in the windows in the drawing room illustrate Mr Moffat's eye for detail.

Mr Grillo said: 'Another little detail is the glass - etched into the glass of about seven or eight windows in the drawing room are love poems, etched into the glass with a diamond ring, which the Tudors also would have done when first declaring their love.'

Grounds: Mr Moffat built the house to show off his collection of Tudor furniture

Grounds: The mansion is set within 1,100 acres of land in the New Forest National Park

For sale: The estate is being sold as four lots are altogether for a combined £11m

But as you might expect with a house which dates back to at least the 11th century, there have been a number of ghostly encounters on the estate.

Mr Grillo said although there were no specific ghost stories, he was certain there was a presence which comes along with property.

He said: 'There's no doubt about it, I'm sure the house is haunted but they all seem to be very friendly and nice encounters.

'I think in the gardens there has been one or two encounters and people have heard things on the landing and that sort of thing.'
