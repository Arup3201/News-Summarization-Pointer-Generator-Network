U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, who was released by the Taliban last year in exchange for five prisoners is to be charged with desertion

An American Army sergeant that was released by the Taliban last year in exchange for five of its fighters in U.S. custody is will be charged with desertion, several reports indicate.

Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl's lawyer has been handed a charge sheet listing out the articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice he has violated, retired Lieutenant Colonel Tony Shaffer revealed. 

Bergdahl's attorney, Eugene R. Fidell, told Daily Mail Online today that he had not been issued a charge sheet on behalf of his client, however. He declined to comment further on the matter.

NBC News said Tuesday it had confirmed the charges but stressed that the Army had yet to formally accuse Bergdahl. 

A former platoon mate of Bergdahl's who spoke to Daily Mail Online, Sgt. Jordan Vaughn, said neither he nor any of the other soldiers that served alongside the former prisoner of war had received any new information regarding the situation, but he considers Shaffer a reliable source of information.

Vaughn told Daily Mail Online he'd spoken to other members of the platoon recently, and they are in agreement that the military should take legal action against Bergdahl.

'We all think absolutely that he should be court-martialed and that he was intending to desert,' Vaughn said.

Retired Lieutenant Colonel Tony Shaffer said Sgt. Bergdahl's attorney had been handed a charge sheet detailing the articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice that have been violated

Referencing previous testimony, Vaughn affirmed that he and other soldiers heard local radio chatter just after Bergdahl disappeared about an American wandering around without his weapon 'trying to make contact with the Taliban.'

'It's very clear to all of us that it was desertion, and obviously that's court-martiable,' Vaughn said.

Bergdahl was held captured and taken captive by the Taliban-aligned Haqqani network in Afghanistan from June 2009 until May 2014 before being swapped by the Barack Obama administration for Taliban fighters imprisoned at a U.S. facility in Guantanamo Bay.

Shaffer, a former U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency official assigned to Afghanistan, now works for the London Center for Policy Research. 

He was made famous in 2010 after the Department of Defense bought and burned all 9,500 copies of his memoir Operation Dark Heart because it allegedly contained classified information.

The retired Army Lt. Colonel told Fox News Monday evening that a number of sources had confirmed the outcome of Bergdahl's military review to him.

Speaking on The O'Reilly Factor, he said: 'His attorney was given what we call a charge sheet. A charge sheet is results of the investigation listing out the articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice that have been violated. The key violation is desertion. And this has been done. The decision has been made. Let me be very clear. As a corporate entity, the Army has decided that they want to pursue Bergdahl for this violation.'

NBC News says the Army may issue charges within the next week. According to the news agency, the sheet will not allege that Bergdahl left the military base with no intention of returning, however.

And while Bergdahl may be remanded to prison, NBC News suggested the military may consider his the time he spent as a hostage punishment enough. He could be let off with a 'less than honorable discharge.'

An Army spokesman flatly denied on Tuesday that Bergdahl had been charged with desertion. 

Major General Ronald Lewis, head of public affairs for the U.S. Army, said in a statement that media reports published Tuesday about the case are 'patently false.' 

If that changes, formal charges could mean Bergdahl would not receive roughly $300,000 in back pay he is currently owed – and he would be demoted back to his previous rank, Private First Class.

After the Obama administration's much criticized exchange, the Army launched an investigation into the circumstances surrounding Bergdahl's departure from his post. The military concluded its review several months ago but has not yet released a report of its findings.

After the Taliban released Sgt. Bergdahl, he spent two weeks recuperating at a U.S. military hospital in Germany before he was  transferred to Brooke Army Medical Center at Fort Sam Houston on June 13.

He has since been assigned to an administrative post on the sprawling Fort Sam Houston Army post in San Antonio, Texas, as he awaits the conclusion of his case.

Sources close to the probe say the former Taliban prisoner is free to carry on with his military duties and has not been placed in custody or under any special restrictions.

The vast military complex houses more than 900 buildings including the San Antonio Military Medical Center and the command headquarters for the United States Army North and United States Army South. 

Sgt Bergdahl was captured by the Taliban after he fled from his unit in Afghanistan without permission

Shaffer accused the Obama administration on Monday of trying to keep the results of the investigation into Sgt. Bergdahl's disappearance a secret.

'This is shaping up to be a titanic struggle behind the scenes,' he said. 'Believe me, the Army here wants to do the right thing … And the White House, because of the political narrative, President Obama cozying up to the parents and because he, President Obama, releasing the five Taliban … The narrative is what the White House does not want to have come out.'

Last year it was revealed that the U.S. army had prosecuted about 1,900 cases of desertion since 2001.

The figure was considered relatively low considering tens of thousands of soldiers had fled the service in the face of deadly combat, long and multiple deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan and strains on military families. 

More than 20,000 soldiers have been dropped from the rolls as deserters since 2006, according to Army data released last year.

In trial cases over the last 13 years, roughly half of the soldiers who were charged pleaded guilty to deserting their posts. Another 78 were tried and convicted.
