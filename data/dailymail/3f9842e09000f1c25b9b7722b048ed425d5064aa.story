If Buddy the parrot was on Old MacDonald’s farm it could squawk here, there and everywhere and no one would mind.

But when it spends all its time indoors at its owner’s home and keeps whistling the classic nursery rhyme, it’s a different story.

Stephen White, who owns the 12-year-old African Grey, has been threatened with court action after neighbours complained that the bird was too noisy.

West Norfolk Council has set up 
equipment to monitor the noise and told Mr White he could face 
prosecution or an anti-social behaviour order unless Buddy stops 
singing.

Mr White, 62, who 
moved into his King’s Lynn home with his wife Glynnis, 58, and Buddy two
years ago, says it is impossible to keep the parrot quiet.

‘What
do they expect me to do – cut his vocal cords?’ he said. ‘I’ve never 
had a problem with Buddy before, wherever I have lived.

‘He’s
an indoor parrot. He never goes outside. The council told me you can 
train parrots to keep quiet, but I said you’re having a laugh aren’t 
you?’

He was notified by the
council on Wednesday that it had fitted equipment in his neighbour’s 
house to record Buddy’s calls. Local residents had kept detailed logs of
its every squawk for two months.

As well as performing Old MacDonald Had A Farm, the bird enjoys whistling the theme tune from the Addams Family.

It
is also fond of squawking ‘Police!’ at full volume – something it 
learned from watching TV crime shows. Mr White has vowed to fight any 
potential legal action taken by the council.

He said: ‘It’s a complete waste of taxpayers’ money and the council has fallen for it.

‘I’m not sure what will happen next, whether it will go to court, but I’ve told the council it can do what it wants.’

A
West Norfolk Council spokesman said: ‘We have received a complaint 
about a parrot and, as with all noise complaints, we are bound by law to
investigate. While the investigation is ongoing, no notices have been 
issued and no formal action taken.’

African
Greys, which can live to at least 60 years in captivity, are thought by
some experts to be as intelligent as dolphins, chimpanzees and human 
toddlers.

They associate 
words with meanings and have a grasp of shape, colour and number. They 
will imitate telephones, microwave beeps, doorbells and even an owner’s 
smoker’s cough.

African 
Greys are the best mimics of all parrots. One, called N’Kisi, is claimed
to have a 950-word vocabulary and has mastered the past, present and 
future tenses.

In 1845, US President Andrew Jackson’s pet African Grey, called Poll, was removed from his funeral for swearing.
