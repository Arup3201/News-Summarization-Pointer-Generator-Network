The Port Authority has killed over 20,000 animals over the past two years.

The most commonly killed species was the laughing gull, with 5,729 killed at JFK Airport, according to a report from The New York Post.

Others included 3,023 European starlings, 2,445 herring gulls, 1,908 mourning doves and 1,070 brown-headed cowbirds, the paper says.

A whopping 1,098 mourning doves, like the ones seen here, were also killed by the Port Authority

The agency, which oversees transportation between New York and New Jersey, also killed three endangered or threatened bird species, according to the paper.

Both endangered and threatened species were also killed. The agency killed a northern harrier with a shotgun at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, despite its endangered status.Â  An American kestrel was also shot at Teterboro. The species is listed as 'threatened' in New Jersey, the Post reports.

At JFK, 11 ospreys were killed. The osprey is labeled at-risk in New York.

62 woodchucks, like the one seen here, were also killed by the agency according to the report

Ron Marsico, Port Authority spokesman told the paper that the agency was able to shoot the osprey because 'nonlethal control efforts were not effective' and that both state and federal authorities had been contacted.

The Port Authority also killed a parakeet, upsetting Priscilla Feral, president of Friends of Animals.

'The idea that parakeets would bring down an aircraft is ridiculous,' she said. 'This gives you an idea of how trigger-happy they [the PA] are.'

Even 4 red foxes, like the one seen here, were killed by the agency

Birds weren't the agency's only victims. According to the report, 82 Eastern cottontail rabbits, 44 black-tailed jackrabbits, 21 raccoons, 4 red foxes and 11 coyotes were also killed.

Despite the news, there may be hope for one species. Though 5 snowy owls were killed according to the data, the Port Authority promised earlier this year to implement a program in which it would trap and relocate them, Gothamist reports.
