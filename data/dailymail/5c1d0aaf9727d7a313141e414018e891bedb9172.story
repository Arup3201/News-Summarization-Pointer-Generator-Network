Cardiff City have confirmed the loan signing of controversial West Ham midfielder Ravel Morrison.

The talented but troubled 21-year-old has signed until December 26, though his reputation as a difficult player to manage makes the move perplexing, considering Cardiff are struggling to appoint a permanent replacement for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.

That situation appears no closer to being resolved after Leyton Orient blocked multiple Cardiff moves for their manager Russell Slade.

But Cardiff have pressed ahead regardless with their efforts to sign Morrison, who was initially a summer target for Solskjaer and will in January face trial over allegations he threatened to throw acid in his former girlfriend's face and have her killed.

He is also accused of threatening to blow up Reah Mansoor's house and is alleged to have assaulted the 19-year-old and her mother, Parveen Mansoor, 39, in Salford in the early hours of July 27.

A Cardiff statement on Wednesday said: ‘An England Under 21 international, Ravel will be eligible to play in up to 15 Championship fixtures during that time, including our game at Charlton Athletic on Boxing Day.’

Morrison had initially announced his transfer on Twitter on Tuesday afternoon: 'Happy to get a 3 month loan @CardiffCityFC time to start playing some football again.' 

He added in another tweet about West Ham, which he later deleted: 'I got no ratings off people in the club not the club it's self (sic) just people in it.'

The move marks Morrison's third loan spell away from West Ham, who he joined for £650,000 from Manchester United in 2012.
