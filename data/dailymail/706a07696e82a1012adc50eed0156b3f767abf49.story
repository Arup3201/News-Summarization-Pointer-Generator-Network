Police in New York City on Wednesday apprehended a man suspected of stabbing to death a 6-year-old boy and injuring his 7-year-old cousin in a savage knife attack inside a housing project elevator in Brooklyn.

Daniel St. Hubert, 27, was held Wednesday night in connection with the death of Prince Joshua 'PJ' Avitto and the injuring of Mikayla Capers. Chicago Bulls power forward Taj Gibson says Prince was his cousin.

Police Commissioner William Bratton, shortly before the announcement of St. Hubert's arrest, had appealed for the public's help in catching him.

‘We need your assistance to apprehend this individual as soon as possible,’ he said.

Before the Sunday evening attack, the boy and the girl had been playing outside the Boulevard Houses under adult supervision. Relatives and witnesses said they went inside alone when they were cornered by a heavyset man in his 20s.

The man used a steak knife to stab each child multiple times, police said. He fled on foot, leaving the knife outside the building, they said. Prince was found in the elevator lying in a pool of blood, Mikayla just outside the building.

Police said they were investigating whether the attacker may have fatally stabbed an 18-year-old Tanaya Grant Copeland days earlier a few blocks away. A similar knife was recovered at the scene of that slaying.

The 5-foot-9, 210-pound St Hubert was taken into custody just after 8pm near 145th Street and 133rd Avenue in Jamaica, Queens, less than an hour after he was publicly identified as a suspect.

'Thank you NYPD, thank you! God is good,' PJ's mother, Aricka McClinton, told DNAInfo Wednesday night. 'Prince said they were going to catch him. Last night, my angel came to me and said, "Hold on mommy, they're going to get him, just hold on."'

St Hubert has an extensive criminal record that lists nine arrests, including for attacks on a correctional officer and a cop. Most recently, the 27-year-old was released on parole May 23 in connection to a domestic assault.

The grisly knife attack cast a spotlight on the issue of surveillance cameras because none was in place to capture any images of the attacker despite funds set aside by the New York City Housing Authority to pay for them.

'We got to find this man. We all have to find this man. My baby is gone,' little Prince Joshua 'P.J.' Avitto's mother Erica sobbed Tuesday. The boy's cousin, Mikayala Capers, 7, was also stabbed and is still being treated in hospital.

'My niece is critical. We've got to find this man,' she added.

St Hubert is also suspected of killing Tanaya Grant-Copeland, 18, as she walked home from marching band practice Friday.

The teen was discovered unconscious shortly before 10:30pm on a sidewalk near a rail yard at Stanley Avenue and Linwood Street in Brooklyn. She had been stabbed multiple times in the neck, back and abdomen and died at Brookdale Hospital.

A taxi driver found her, according to a release from family spokesman Tony Herbert.

Her devastated mother, Rochelle Copeland, told NBC New York: 'She drums, and basically that's her whole life.' Sobbing she added: 'I didn't get to say goodbye.'

On Monday, police released an image of the knife found near the elevator where the two children were butchered.

It is a Dura Edge knife by Imperial Knife, and the NYPD said it hasn't been manufactured since 2004.

Crime scene: Both murders took place in or near this apartment building, in the Brooklyn neighborhood of East New York

The shocking back-to-back slayings have prompted other residents to slam the NYC Housing

Authority after it failed to erect surveillance cameras int he area despite the City Council allocating money towards it years back.

P.J.'s distraught father Nicholas Avitto wore his son's backpack to the boy's school yesterday.

'I just walked to the school. I talked to him. I acted like he was there,' he said.

'God gave me a blessing. I had him at 50. He was born on Father’s Day. I will remember his smile, his arrogance, his stubborn little ways.'

The father then broke down: 'I'm just so hurt. They took my little boy away from me, oh, my God.'

Mikayla, who suffered a collapsed lung in the stabbing, was transferred Monday night to New York-Presbyterian Hospital Columbia, where her mother said she is in stable condition.

Her family said Wednesday the girl cannot speak, has a breathing tube and is slipping in and out of consciousness, but responding to commands.

The 
children were in an elevator at an apartment block in Brooklyn's East 
New York neighborhood and heading out for ices when they were 
attacked at 5.50pm Sunday, police said.

The knife-wielding maniac stabbed the young cousins in their torsos after telling them to 'shut up', a police source told the New York Daily News.

The body of little PJ was found in the elevator in the Boulevard housing development on Schenck Avenue near Stanley Avenue.

Mikayla was found in front of a neighboring building after she apparently stumbled from the elevator.

The children's relatives were struggling to comprehend the senseless crime.

'He
 took my pride and joy away,' Nicholas Avitto earlier told the Daily News, as he revealed his heartbreak that he had not 
kissed his son that day.

'I'm 
devastated. I'm beyond comprehension. I'm trying to understand how God 
works. My son is gone. That was the light of my life.'

His mother told the New York Post that her son was just 16 days away from turning seven.

'They done killed my baby!' she said outside Brookdale Hospital.

Mikayla's mother, Sherina Capers, 21, said she couldn't understand how someone could attack two young children.

'This don't make no sense,' she said. 'They went to go get an icy and they never made it downstairs.'
