Minister could step in to block a proposed 10 per cent pay rise for MPs that would take their salaries to £74,000 a year, George Osborne indicated yesterday.

The Chancellor made clear his opposition to the move at a time when increases to public-sector workers’ earnings are capped at 1 per cent.

He said the proposal by the Parliamentary pay watchdog was ‘not the final verdict’ and ministers would ‘tackle the issue’ after the general election.

The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) has recommended that MPs should get an extra £7,000 on top of their £67,000 salary.

However, in return MPs would have to make larger pension contributions and lose lucrative ‘golden goodbye’ payments when they leave office.

Ipsa – which was set up to monitor MPs’ spending after the expenses scandal in 2009 – has defended the plans on the grounds that, overall, there would be no increased cost to the taxpayer.

But John O’Connell, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Hiking politicians’ wages at a time when the national debt is still rising would be totally inappropriate.

‘In insisting on a pay rise, Ipsa is demonstrating itself once again to be totally unfit for purpose. This overgrown monster of a quango needs to understand that the public don’t want the cost of Government to go up any further.’

Polling commissioned by Ipsa found that two in three people thought the proposed salary of £74,000 was too high.

The main party leaders have all made their opposition to the rise clear, but many backbench MPs appear to back the change.

Speaking on BBC1’s Andrew Marr show, Mr Osborne reiterated that he did not believe it should be implemented.

He added: ‘I don’t think it’s acceptable at a time when there’s continuing pay restraint in the public sector that MPs would receive such a big increase. But this is not the final verdict, this is not the final report. There will be a report after the election, and that’s when we’re going to have to tackle this issue.’

The plans were confirmed by new Ipsa chief executive Marcial Boo in his first interview, in which he claimed MPs should not be paid a ‘miserly amount’.

He said: ‘All the evidence points towards MPs’ salaries having fallen behind.’

The failure to pay ‘fair’ rates would make it harder to recruit good candidates for Parliament, he told the Sunday Telegraph, adding: ‘This is an important job, the job of an MP. They are there to represent us all, to form laws, to send young people to war.

‘It is not an easy thing to do. We want to have good people doing the job and they need to be paid fairly. Now, that’s not paid in excess but it’s not being paid a miserly amount either.

‘There are lots of professionals in public life and in the private sector who earn a lot more than that – so it is not an excessive amount of money at all.’

MPs are already due a 1 per cent increase to £67,731 next April and unless ministers step in it will go up again a month later to £74,000. Mr Boo insisted a change in the law would be needed to prevent Ipsa following through with its proposals.

Dave Prentis, secretary-general of the Unison union, said the announcement of the proposed pay rise left him furious, adding: ‘Very few things make me angry but I have got to admit the anger I felt when I heard that.’

He said the NHS pay-review body was pressured to recommend just 1 per cent, in line with pay-restraint policy, but ministers refused to pay even that, adding: ‘Now we find there are moves to pay MPs far in excess of anything Government service workers may expect to receive.’
