It's the list all parents to be need to see - Australia's most popular baby names.

For the first time, Oliver is the most popular boy's name in the country after leaping from the third spot in 2012, while Charlotte took out the top spot for newborn girls in 2013 and has held the position since 2011.

More than 2,082 baby boys were called Oliver, which is of Latin origin, and 1,969 girls were named Charlotte, which is of French origin.

Australia's most popular baby names are in and Oliver is the preferred choice for newborn boys, while parents chose Charlotte for girls

Despite being the most popular name in four states,  William took out the second most common boy's name overall. Jack rounded up the top three and marked a 100-year return of more traditional names.

Half of the top ten most popular girl's names finish with an 'a', with Olivia the second most popular name, Ava in 4th spot and Mia, Amelia and Sophia/Sofia all making the list.

With the Baby Names Australia 2014 report compiled by research agency McCrindle, one in 10 Australian babies, about 31,983 out of more than 300,000 births in 2013, were given a name featured among the most popular top 10.

And with the record numbers of babies born each year peaking at more than 315,000 last year, parents are trying their hardest to give their children an original name by avoiding those in the top 20, the research report states.

In 2012 the most popular top 20 names were given to 29,083 baby boys and 28,301 newborn girls but these numbers dropped, to 28,198 boys' names and 26,788 girls' names being featured in the top 20 list in 2013.

Traditional names such as Ruby, William and Jack, which were popular 100 years ago, have enjoyed a resurgence in recent years

With the move away from the most popular names, only 40.6 per cent of newborns in 2012 were given a name featured in the country's top 100, with this figure dropping to 39.6 per cent last year.

Despite the trend, parents tend to give boys more common names compared to girls.

There were 9,267 newborn boys given one of the five most popular names last year, compared to 8,239 baby girls with names from the top five most popular girls' names.

The report also points to the resurgence of more traditional names, with names such a William and Jack, which were also preferred 100 years ago, with names that were common a few decades ago being pushed out.

The name William ranked 2nd overall in NSW in the 1910s and has been the most popular in the state since 2009.

Jack reached the 5th spot in the 1920s in NSW before declining from the 1940s to 1970s. Between 2000 and 2004 it enjoyed resurgence in popularity.
