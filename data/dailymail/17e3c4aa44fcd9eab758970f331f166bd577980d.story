It's a time when diamonds are the flavour of the month in the midfield on a football pitch but Jamie Redknapp had a different sort in mind on Wednesday night.

The former Liverpool and England star was dressed to impress along with his wife Louise as they attended a launch party for the jewellers Pandora in London.

Under the campaign #PandoraWishes, the couple have been promoting the Pandora jewellery range and were available for the launch of it at the Oxford Street store.

The Sportsmail columnist was surrounded by familiar faces at the event including Abbey Clancy, the wife of Stoke striker Peter Crouch.

Following the event, the couple happily stopped to sign autographs outside the flagship store.
