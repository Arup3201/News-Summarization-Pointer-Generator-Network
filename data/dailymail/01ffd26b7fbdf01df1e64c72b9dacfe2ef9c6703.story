Smiles: Giuseppe Morello (pictured), 43, began an affair with the woman, a 47-year old widow, after the death of her husband

A teaching assistant had to get police to restrain her ‘insatiable’ lover after she dumped him for being too demanding in the bedroom.

The 47-year-old mother of three, who was looking for love after the death of her husband, began a whirlwind romance with Italian waiter Giuseppe Morello, 43.

But she broke off their passionate affair because she grew tired of the pressure  to have sex with him ‘morning, noon  and night’.

Morello was devastated by the split and tried to win her back. He bombarded her with as many as 20 texts a day, telling her: ‘My life is over without you.’

He also turned up at the school where she worked and tried to woo her in front of the staff and pupils. Eventually police had to step in to stop his Casanova campaign.

Morello struck up a relationship with the unnamed woman last  September, after he served her at the Ciao Baby Italian restaurant in Egerton, near Bolton.

After the first few weeks of the relationship they even rented a house 
together.  However, she soon noticed that he was ‘possessive and 
clingy’.

Neil White, prosecuting, told Blackburn magistrates’ court:
‘It turned into a situation when he was extremely possessive, jealous 
and arguments occurred.

She felt pressured by him to have sexual 
intercourse every night, and then in the mornings, and afternoons as 
well. She felt she couldn’t meet his sexual demands.

‘She ended the relationship after six weeks because of the constant pressure to go to bed with him.

‘He began to text and phone and pester her, telling her how much he loved her.

‘He
continued to be controlling and possessive, and there were constant 
demands for sex, with him sulking whenever she refused.’

The police were called in last November after the couple had a blazing row.

They removed Morello from the house and warned him not to come back or contact her again.

He
also received a caution for assault. ‘After that she received in excess
of 20 text messages a day and countless phone calls,’ said  Mr White.

‘She
ignored these but he also turned up outside her home. And, on a couple 
of occasions, he was outside the school where  she works as a teaching 
assistant and tried to engage her in conversation.’

Ciao Baby: Morello had struck up a relationship with the mother-of-three last September after he served her at the Ciao Baby Restaurant, in Egerton, near Bolton

Police decided 
to arrest Morello in February when he turned up at the woman’s house – 
while officers were there taking her statement.

Yesterday Morello admitted  harassment, and was told not to contact his former lover under the terms of a restraining order.

He will also have to complete 200 hours of unpaid work, as well as paying £145 in costs and a victim surcharge.

In
mitigation his lawyer, Damian Pickup, said: ‘He accepts that he 
bombarded her with text messages and phone calls, but these were not 
threatening. All he wanted to do was tell her how much he loved her and 
ask if there was a way back for them. He was simply declaring his 
undying love and seeking answers to what was going on between them.

‘He says it was the language of love and nothing more.’

But district judge Peter Ward told him: ‘Bombarding someone with text messages, even saying “I love you” is harassment.

‘It takes two people to be in a relationship.

‘I’m
prepared to accept that the text messages were not particularly 
threatening. Nevertheless, it is harassment because she didn’t want this
relationship to continue.’
