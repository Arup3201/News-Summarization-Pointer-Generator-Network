Shiv Kumar Yadav, who was arrested in Mathura on December 7 for allegedly raping a 25-year-old female executive on Friday night in Delhi, could be a serial rapist, authorities revealed. 

The 32-year-old allegedly told police that he was arrested in a rape case some years ago from South Delhi’s Mehrauli area, and was out on bail.

The vehicle in which the rape allegedly took place, a Swift DZire car, was first recovered from Yadav’s house in Mathura’s Chanderpuri Mohalla.

The man himself was nabbed on Sunday evening in Anand Van, a remote village in Mathura two kilometres away from his house. He has since been brought to Delhi.  

“Yadav was questioned at the Highway Police station after he was nabbed from Chandrapuri Mohalla. After sustained interrogation, he broke down and admitted that he had raped the 25-year-old girl when she was returning from a party in Vasant Vihar in south Delhi to her home in Inderlok in North Delhi on Friday night,” police sources said.

They added that the accused also disclosed that he was involved in a separate rape incident in Mehrauli area. 

Deputy Commissioner of Police (North), Madhur Verma said: “We are verifying details of the previous case with the concerned police station."

“After raping, and then threatening the victim not to report the incident, Yadav went to his ancestral house in Chandrapuri Mohalla on Saturday morning. His wife was not expecting him home at that time and, seeing him in a dishevelled state, asked him if he was the rapist news channels had been reporting on. He lied to her, saying he was being framed in a false case. He told her they would have to leave immediately. But before they could flee, several teams of Delhi Police arrived and Yadav took off on his own,” police sources added. 

The chase 

Meanwhile, after registering a case of rape on Saturday morning, police began scanning Yadav's mobile phone details as he had made a call to his victim’s phone to threaten her. However, the number registered to Gaurav’s name included a false address on the SIM registration documents. 

“With the help of technical surveillance, police scanned the call details record (CDR) and found phone numbers of Yadav’s relatives and friends, all of whom stay in Mathura. Later, police discovered the address of his ancestral home where Yadav stayed during his holidays with his 28-year-old wife, two daughters and a son,” the sources added.

After reaching Chandrapuri Mohalla, Delhi police grilled Yadav’s relatives for details on his possible hideouts. A raid was conducted at his house, but he had fled by then. His family members were also quizzed by Delhi police and local police personnel without success.

Drama unfolded on Sunday evening when the police announced a reward of Rs 1 lakh for anyone willing to disclose information about Yadav's whereabouts. 

Soon enough, a villager approached them with the tip off that Yadav was hiding in Anand Van. 

“A team immediately left for the location and after spotting them, Yadav started running. He entered a house and locked the door from inside. He refused to come out and began screaming. He called out to villagers that he was innocent and was being  framed. The drama ended after 20 minutes when the police finally broke open the door and nabbed him at around 7pm,” police sources said.

The story 

DCP Verma said that the rape incident came to light at 1.25am on Saturday after the victim, who works with a finance company in Gurgaon, made a call to the Police Control Room (PCR). 

“She told us that she had booked the cab from her smart phone through Uber and the driver arrived around 15 minutes before his reported time. On the way, she dozed off in the cab as she was tired after a long day at work. The driver saw her sleeping and took the cab to a secluded spot near Buddha Garden and Ridge area and forced himself on her. The victim tried to fight back, but he overpowered her. He reportedly told her that if she shouted for help, he would insert a rod in her genitals, and reminded her of the December 16, 2012, gang-rape in the city,” said the police.
