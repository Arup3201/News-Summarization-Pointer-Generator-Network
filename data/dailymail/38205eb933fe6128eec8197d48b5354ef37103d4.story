These gorgeous quadruplet girls made medical history when they were all born from the same embryo.

But they have quickly reached another milestone in their lives when they started nursery on Friday at Busy Bees in the grounds of Rotherham Hospital in South Yorkshire.

Darcy, Caroline, Elisha and Alexis Clark - are thought to be the first quads in the world born from the same ebryo - and weighed just 10lbs between them when they arrived.

Milestone: Proud parents Justin and Christine Clark show off their brood on their first birthday - they had been trying for a baby for nine years before having success through their first round of IVF

Proud parents Justin and Christine Clark had been trying for a baby for nine years before having success through their first round of IVF.

The youngsters - now 14-months-old - will be attending nursery at Busy Bees in the grounds of the Rotherham Hospital where they were cared for following their birth at Sheffield's Jessop Hospital on March 25 last year. 

Lorry driver Justin from Rotherham said:
 'The girls all really enjoyed the first half day at the nursery and it 
will be so exciting when they start there full-time.

'They were
 good as gold, as we knew they would be. 'These girls were ten weeks 
premature and so any milestone for them is huge for us. We are just so 
proud.'

Helen Smith, nursery manager at Busy Bees, said: 'We are happy to be welcoming the gorgeous sisters at the nursery.'

Say cheese: The amazing sisters show off their individuality as they clutch different toys at nursery

Darcy was the first born at 2.46pm weighing 2lbs, Caroline followed at 2.46pm weighing 2lbs 3oz. Elisha was born at 2.47pm weighing 2lbs 14oz and the last was Alexis, born weighing 3lbs at 2.48pm.

At 24 weeks, Mrs Clark was taken into hospital with breathlessness, but doctors managed to keep the pregnancy under control until week 30, when the girls were born by Caesarean section.

Justin said: 'It was a very emotional time for us as we'd been trying for nine years to have one child and had no luck.'

Staff nurse Christine, 37, said previously: 'When we found out we were having four babies, I just couldn't believe it. I was speechless and to be honest, I didn't believe it until I saw them for myself.

‘We’re
 the first people it’s happened to and even some doctors find it hard to
 believe,' Justin told the Daily Mail at the time of birth.
