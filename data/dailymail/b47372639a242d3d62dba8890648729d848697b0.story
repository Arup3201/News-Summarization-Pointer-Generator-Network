Apple is rumoured to be adding a gold colour option for its revamped full size iPad Air, which is expected to be unveiled later this month.

The move is thought to be designed to boost sales of its full-size tablets, which are in decline.

Until now, iPads have only been available in a monochromatic colour scheme, but a golden makeover would make the tablets more similar to the Californian company’s new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, which come in three colours.

New versions of the 9.7-inch tablet  could include a golden metal rear cover as well as the silver and grey currently offered for the iPad Air, ‘people familiar with the matter’ told Bloomberg.  

The new iPads are predicted to sport a thinner, more rounded design, similar to the iPhone 6. 

Hidden code in the latest iOS 8.1 beta software hints that the iPads will feature a Touch ID fingerprint sensor and Apple Pay functionality, The Guardian reported.

The code says that users can 'pay with iPad using Touch ID. With Apple Pay, you no longer need to type card numbers and shipping information.' 

However, it is not clear whether the new iPad will come with NFC functionality, which is used for contactless payments, as it relies on a Wi-Fi or mobile connection.

Apple is preparing to launch a range of iMacs with Ultra HD 'Retina' display screens in a bid to reinvigorate desktop computer sales.

The firm is expected to reveal them alongside a new version of its Mac software called Yosemite, and news iPads this month.

'A new line of iMacs with ultra high-resolution Retina Displays is in late testing stages within Apple, according to our sources who have used the future desktop computer,' said 9to5 Mac. http://9to5mac.com/2014/09/29/retina-imacs-with-os-x-yosemite-in-late-testing-within-apple-could-launch-soon/

'While the machine will sport a thin profile similar to that of the current design, which was introduced in 2012, it will be packed with new internals such as faster processors and improved Wi-Fi antennas,' it says.

The firm will also launch a new version of its Mac software called Yosemite.

The Yosemite software will allow users to make and receive calls and notifications from their Mac - even if their iPhone is in another room.

The software has also been overhauled with a new 'flat' look, and can search the web without having to open a browser.

The software is the first to be overseen by Apple's Sir Jonathan Ive.

Apple is also rumoured to be launching a larger iPad with a 12.9-inch screen next year, which if true, could offer 76 per cent more screen area than the current 9.7 inch models.

The latest swathe of Apple tablets could come with a split screen function, which would allow users of an iPad to open two apps side-by-side on one screen. 

Sales of iPads have slumped for two quarters, after climbing from $5 billion (£3 billion) when they were launched in 2010, to $30 billion (£19 billion)  in 2012 and $32 billion in 2013 (£20 billion).

The firm hasn't unveiled an updated iPad since last October when it launched the iPad Air and Mini and it appears that consumers have instead been drawn to smartphones with larger screens, including recently, Apple’s iPhone 6 Plus, which has a 5.5 inch screen.

Apple is not new to the strategy of launching colourful products to boost its sales. 

In 1999 it rolled out different coloured iMacs which were successful, but sales of its iPhone 5C – a ‘budget’ version of the iPhone 5S – have not sold as well as the company hoped.

The company is expected to unveil the new iPads at the same time as a range of iMacs with Ultra HD 'Retina' display screens in a bid to reinvigorate desktop computer sales.

The new line of iMacs is rumoured to have ultra high-resolution Retina Displays, a thin profile and faster processors as well as improved Wi-Fi antennas.
