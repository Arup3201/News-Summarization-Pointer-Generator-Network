Eric Schmidt has written a book predicting the future of technology

Eric Schmidt, Google's executive chairman, has predicted China will be the world's most 'sophisticated hacker' in his new book predicting the future of technology.

His new book 'The Digital Age' co-written by Jared Cohen, who runs Google Ideas, the search giantâ€™s think tank, believe that China, is 'the most sophisticated and prolific hacker of foreign companies'.

They also say that the country is the 'the world's most active and enthusiastic filterer of information', highlighting how China strongly censors information from outside, carefully selecting what its population can access.

The Wall Street Journal, who reviewed the book, say that the book concentrates on how China's government and state companies are willing to use cyber crime - giving the increasingly powerful state 'an economic and political edge'.

The Google pair examine how China's readiness to commit cyber crime is a 'difference in values' from other countries such as America - meaning the country will spy on big businesses compared to other states that crack down on such activity.

The duo predict that China will only continue to grow in terms of influence, as their technological firms become more competitive and more advanced.

According to the Wall Street Journal, the book predicts how other countries might follow China's lead in terms of hacking, so as to compete in terms of political and economical gain.

Chinese authorities and Google have had a fraught relationship since January 2010, when the company said it may shut down Chinese operations due to a 'sophisticated and targeted' cyber attack.

Google said at the time that it was no longer willing to censor its Chinese search engine.

The company began to redirect search queries from mainland China to its Hong Kong website.

In December last year the ruling Communist party announced moves to force internet users to fully identify themselves to service providers, raising fresh concerns about freedom of speech in the country.

Tensions over censorship highlight Beijing's complicated relations with global technology companies.

The communist government wants to boost incomes by promoting high-tech industry but insists on controlling access to information.

Beijing promotes Internet use for education and business and has the world's biggest population of Internet users, with 513 million people online as of December, but tries to block politically sensitive material.
