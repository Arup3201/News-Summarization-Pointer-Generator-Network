The £50million Hollywood mansion already boasted ‘a masterful opulence once only reserved for nobility’ — or so the estate agents’ blurb went when she bought it.

But, clearly, this was still not quite grand enough for Petra Ecclestone, the 25-year-old daughter of Formula 1 mogul Bernie Ecclestone.

So having bought it, she was keen to impose her own unique taste on the 56,000 sq ft property and turn it into her own little palace as quickly as possible.

But there is
 also something of a car-crash about the wide range of art which the 
couple chose to decorate many of the rooms. It reportedly stretches all 
the way from twin 5ft sculptures of Pamela Andersons in a bikini, to the
 Old Masters portraits, including work by Van Dyck, which Mr Stunt 
collects and which line the hallway.

The
 123-room house, claimed to rival the White House in size and built in 
1991 in the style of a French chateau, belonged to the late U.S. film 
and television producer Aaron Spelling, the creator of Charlie’s Angels 
and Dynasty, and his wife Candy.

Petra
 bought it for £50 million in 2011. Soon after she began the startling 
make-over, which took just 12 weeks — three weeks to plan and nine to 
install, involving an army of 500 workers and costing £15 million.

She has now put it on the market for £88 million so stands to make an eye-watering £23 million profit — if she can find a buyer.

Out went the chintz and more traditional trappings of the previous owners and in came a new look that is undeniably dramatic, some might even say jaw-dropping... or, dare one even suggest, just a little bit showy?

From the white marble floor with bold black stripes of the hallway, through the cavernous his and hers closets where Petra and her businessman husband James Stunt keep rack upon rack of designer clothes and cabinets crammed with top-end watches, to the three deep-buttoned gold hairdressing stations and two ‘mani-pedi’ chairs - so Petra and friends can have a manicure and pedicure after having their hair coiffed - in the beauty salon bedecked with pictures of Marilyn Monroe, little could be called understated.

There are brown hues in some parts of the mansion, and Petra has described the look as ‘very dark and kind of sexy with a boudoir feel’.

The sprawling house also features a specially designed dog pampering room and a ‘nightclub’ in the basement complete with bowling alley and pool room.

Set in five acres, it has space for at least 100 cars — handy if you’re having a few friends round, presumably — and has an outdoor swimming pool and tennis court.

Petra married Mr Stunt in a £12million ceremony at Odescalchi Castle near Rome in 2011. She gave birth to the couple’s first child, Lavinia, in February last year.

In a recent interview with W magazine about her remodelling of the house, Petra said: ‘I know the house is huge, but with the other houses we looked at that were a similar size to this, you felt like you were in a museum. They didn’t feel homely. I think because there was a family here previously it was warmer and cosier.’
