The Department of Health and Human Services will spent an estimated $1.15 billion this year caring for minors in its Undocumented Alien Children (UAC) program, and Senate Democrats said Tuesday that they want to add an additional $1 billion for 2015.

The program, part of the agency's Office of Refugee Resettlement, is responsible for the health and welfare of children who cross the U.S. border illegally and arrive without parents.

An unprecedented flood of such children has arrived in recent weeks, with leaked photos showing overcrowded holding facilities run by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement division of the Department of Homeland Security.

Underage illegal immigrants traveling without family members are held in those makeshift detention centers, three-quarters of which are on military bases, for a maximum of 72 hours while they are processed into the U.S. immigration system and given court dates.

FLOOD: Children have raced across the U.S. border since President Obama's 2012 speech announcing that he had relaxed deportation standards for children who were already in the country

HHS says the number of 'unaccompanied alien children' it will serve in 2014 is more than double what it took in last year, but most sober estimates put the number far higher -- at least at 80,000

After that, HHS takes over, with a dedicated budget for this year of $868 million, according to its most recent budget. A Senate Democratic aide told MailOnline on Tuesday that additional discretionary funds brought the planned total for 2014 to $911.9 million.

But HHS's budget, prepared last year, anticipates caring for 60,000 children, not the 80,000 who more recent estimates expect to pour across the border – mostly from Central American countries.

Adjusting for that difference, the agency will have to shift additional discretionary dollars into the UAC program, bringing the total to at least $1.2 billion.

At least one estimate, appearing in the Washington Examiner, projects a total of 120,000 for fiscal year 2014.

In 2011 HHS took custody of 6,775 such children. The number was 13,625 in 2012 and 24,668 in 2013.

Despite widespread forecasts of another massive increase past the 60,000 expected for the current fiscal year, which ends on September 30, an HHS spokesperson told MailOnline on Tuesday afternoon that the agency's internal expectations haven't changed.

'We are still using 60K,' he wrote in an email.

The spokesperson also referred questions about HHS's budget to the Office of Management and Budget inside the White House; that agency did not respond to emails seeking comment.

Senate Democrats, led by California Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski, announced Tuesday that they aim to put an additional $1 billion in play for 2015, bringing the program's planned total to $1.94 billion.

That number would correspond to an expectation of more than 200,000 illegal alien children arriving next year.

'This is an emergency situation by any definition,' said Mikulski, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, on Tuesday. She also referred to the tens of thousands of children swarming into the United States as 'an urgent humanitarian crisis.'

Not just adults: Border Patrol agents are apprehending hundreds of illegal immigrant children every day, and the Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for taking care of them until a suitable adult family member can claim them

Unlike previous waves of illegal immigrants, hardly any of the children pouring across America's southern border are from Mexico; most of the flood is coming from Central America

Mikulski added that her committee foresees that the problem will get worse, providing 'expanded transfer authority to respond to sudden or urgent needs in the future ... to increase shelter capacity and provide critical support services for children in HHS care.'

The appropriations committee will take up Mikulski's funding bill on Thursday.

Feinstein lined up in favor of the added spending on Tuesday, saying in a statement that 'the recent influx of tens of thousands of children entering the country without their parents has resulted in emergency situations in border states.'

'Federal, state and local officials need increased resources to properly shelter, feed and clothe these children as they work to find solutions to these heartbreaking situations.'

In 2013, HHS budgeted just $376 billion to deal with the problem. But that fiscal year began just months after President Barack Obama announced a major immigration law exemption for children who were brought into the U.S. illegally before June 2007.

Children in Central America, and their parents, got a garbled message, believing that they could take advantage of a policy shift and enter the United States with impunity.

Those who make it to the United States and are captured by border patrol officers get classroom education, mental health and medical services, recreation and other taxpayer-funded services.

The Department of Justice is paying for their attorneys.

Texas Sen. John Cornyn slammed President Obama on Tuesday for the influx of young illegals: 'These children are being preyed on by drug cartels and human traffickers, and they¿re at high risk of being kidnapped, raped, or even killed'

“The average length of stay in the program is 
currently near 35 days,' HHS says in published information sheets. 'Of the children served, some 85% are reunified 
with their families.'

It's unclear how many of those family members are in the United States legally.

'The majority of the youth are cared for through a network of state-licensed ORR-funded care providers.'

In a Senate floor speech Tuesday, Texas Republican John Cornyn blamed the White House for creating the problem.

'Sadly, this crisis is directly the result of President Obama's own policies and it involves tens of thousands of young children,' he said.

'These children are being preyed on by 
drug cartels and human traffickers, and they’re at high risk of being 
kidnapped, raped, or even killed while traveling in this long dangerous 
journey to the United States.'

'But sadly, when they arrive here, we still
 have no way of guaranteeing their safety because of lack of an adequate
 plan to deal with this humanitarian crisis.'

Cornyn also slammed the White House for sending mixed signals to countless Third World families, saying that by changing immigration policy unilaterally, 'the president has created an extremely dangerous incentive for children and their parents to cross into the United States.'
