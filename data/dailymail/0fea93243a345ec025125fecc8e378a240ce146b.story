Traditionally prim and feminine, Chanel has taken inspiration from sport for its new collection.

Karl Lagerfeld interspersed models clad in masculine cricket-inspired knitwear, shin pads, cricket gloves and bats among the usual palate of elegant separates in his Chanel Cruise 2014 collection shown in Singapore yesterday.

Holding bats like handbags and with a thumb hooked into their trousers, models strutted down the runway in their sports kits like they were couture gowns.

Male models also got in on the action sporting cricket jackets, gloves, balls and bats embossed with the Chanel logo.

The show, staged in a disused former nutmeg plantation, featured a beauty look of punky spiked fringe hairstyles, a clear pale base and bold blue eyeliner for the female models.

The rest of the Chanel Cruise collection featured sharp dresses, jackets, knitwear and swimsuits paired with chic two-tone mid heels or sneakers.

Cara Delevingne made an appearance, sporting a super-toned midriff while walking in a cropped navy jumper and shorts combo paired with chunky chain jewels.

Cream, black and navy dominated the colourway of Chanel's offering, with the odd pop of soft pink and maroon.

'I like the idea that it's not impeccable. There's a romantic charm that new things cannot always have,' said Karl Lagerfeld, Chanel's head designer and creative director.

'It's not [just] about the historical details, but also the mood.'

'It's a bit of Chanel's history and a bit of influence from this part of the world,' he told WWD.

'You don't get into the details, you reinvent the details.'
