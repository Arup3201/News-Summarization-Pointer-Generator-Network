Spared prison: Ayan Hadi, the wife of white Muslim convert Richard Dart, admitted failing to give police information about his terrorist plot

The wife of a convicted terrorist has received a 12 month suspended sentence at the Old Bailey for failing to provide information that might have helped in his arrest and prosecution.

Ayan Hadi, 31, of Acton, west London, had already admitted failing to alert the authorities when her husband Richard Dart, a white Muslim convert, had planned to fly to Pakistan for combat training which could then be followed by violent acts of terrorism.

She had pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to failing to provide information that she knew or believed might have helped secure the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of her husband for an act of terrorism.

In sentencing Mr Justice Sweeney, sitting at the Old Bailey, told Hadi that 'justice could be tempered by mercy' particularly in cases involving someone who is vulnerable or in a relationship with a defendant.

Hadi had been in an abusive first marriage, felt isolated and wanted a happy home life, the court was told.

She was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment suspended for two years, a two year supervision order plus a 10 year notification requirement where she will have to tell the authorities of her whereabouts.

Dart was jailed for six years in April with two co-conspirators Jahangir Alom and Imran Mahmood for engaging in conduct in preparation of acts of terrorism.

The judge told Hadi that there had been 'an element of choice' in her decision not to alert the authorities after Dart revealed his intentions to her in November 2011.

He also noted that having a first husband who was 'clearly abusive' towards her had 'coloured in part your relationship to the information' which Dart told her.

Dart also put her 'in a difficult position' by making her 'choose between your love for him' and balancing out her duty to tell the authorities. 

The judge noted that Hadi was of good character and that neither she nor any member of her family had shown any Jihadist sympathies.

Hadi and Dart met on the internet in 
August 2011, they married a month later and she claimed she had no idea 
he was an extremist until she later saw a BBC documentary by his 
step-brother Robb Leech - called My Brother The Islamist.

The
judge said: 'You have demonstrated remorse for your behaviour. This 
experience has made you aware of your responsibilities which you should 
have been aware of in the first place.'

Remorse: Ayan Hadi's lawyer said she had no idea her husband was an extremist until his half-brother made a documentary about him

Imran Mahmood received nine years and nine months, and Jahangir Alom was jailed for four years and six months.

At the time they were sentenced, the judge said they were all 'committed fundamentalists' who would have been prepared to kill.

Dart and Alom travelled to Pakistan 
to try to get terrorist training, and took advice from Mahmood who had 
already visited the country, the court heard.

Former BBC security guard Dart also 
discussed bomb making with Mahmood, and spoke of targeting the Wiltshire
town of Royal Wootton Bassett - which became a focal point for the 
repatriation of UK soldiers from Afghanistan.

Dart, who changed his name to 
Salahuddin al-Britani, became involved in extremism after moving from 
his home town of Weymouth, Dorset, to east London and fraternising with 
radical Muslim Anjem Choudary.

Emails between Hadi and Dart showed 
that she 'endorsed his security conscious approach' including the need 
for passwords, the judge said.

He noted it was 'equally clear that Dart made his terrorist intentions plain'.

Mozammel Hossain, defending, claimed 
that Hadi was a decent woman now with a young child who had married Dart
while 'not knowing the type of man that he was'.

He described her as a woman who 
wanted a warm loving home life but she was quite weak willed. She 
suffers from a post-natal condition.

'She was desperate to have a family, to be married and have a child,' Mr Hossain claimed.

Her first husband was an abusive man who kept her locked up in the house, the court was told.

Mr Hossain added she did not 'condone
or support anything that her husband stood for' and there is 'no 
evidence in this case that this lady held any radical or extremist 
views. It was all about her desire to keep in touch with her husband.'

Dart, a
son of teachers, also discussed bomb-making with Mahmood, and military 
repatriation town Wootton Bassett as a potential target.

Police
discovered fragments of text on his laptop that revealed that the pair 
had used the computer to have a 'silent conversation' to avoid possible 
surveillance bugs - opening a Word document and taking it in turns to 
type, then deleting the text.

They
mistakenly assumed none of it would be stored on the machine but 
forensic experts who worked through 2,000 pages of computer code 
deciphered fragments of what was said, including Mahmood making a 
reference to Wootton Bassett and then adding: 'If it comes down to it, 
it’s that or even just to deal with a few MI5 MI6 heads.'

The trio were captured in a huge 
surveillance operation by Scotland Yard and MI5. Investigators learned 
friends Dart and Alom teamed up with Mahmood in a bid to train with Al 
Qaeda in Pakistan, after a previous trip ended in failure.

Mahmood said he had seen a bomb-making manual.

Mr Justice Simon told the trio they 
held 'radical Islamist beliefs and have shown yourselves to be committed
to acts of terrorism'.

Mahmood and Dart were both given 
extended sentences, meaning that they will serve two-thirds of their 
prison terms rather than half, and they will spend five years on 
licence.

The judge said that they were all 'committed fundamentalists' who would have been prepared to kill.

He told Dart and Mahmood: 'I'm 
satisfied to the required criminal standard that neither of you had 
ruled out an attack in the United Kingdom, and that you, Mahmood, were 
looking at arming yourself with a bomb.'

Counter-terrorism teams also believed that the pair used the same tactic walking down the street with a mobile phone.

Mr Justice Simon said the men held ‘radical Islamic views’, were ‘dangerous’ and could kill.

Choudary, whose groups 
Islam4UK and Muslims Against Crusades have been banned, launched an 
extraordinary defence of Dart, saying he was jailed for a ‘thought 
crime’ and had ‘committed no sin and harmed nobody’, adding ‘Jihad 
training’ is a duty for Muslim men.

The cleric appeared with Dart in a BBC
film, My Brother The Islamist. In it, Dart said there were ‘many 
misconceptions about Al Qaeda’ and protested at a homecoming for 
soldiers.

Met Deputy Assistant Commissioner 
Stuart Osborne called the case ‘a classic example of how terrorists live
in our midst’.

Dart and Mahmood were both born in the UK, while Alom was born in Bangladesh but is a British citizen.
