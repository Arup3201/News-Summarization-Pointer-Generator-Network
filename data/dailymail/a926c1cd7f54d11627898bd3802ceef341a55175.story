Cardiff cruised into the fourth round of the FA Cup as a fans protest resulted in a paltry home crowd.

Goals from Joe Ralls, Kadeem Harris and Kenwyne Jones put the Bluebirds into the hat for the next round as they eased past League One strugglers Colchester.

Former West Ham striker Freddie Sears grabbed a consolation for the visitors, but it was the sparse attendance which was the main talking point.

Attendance: 4,194 

Just 4,194 turned up to watch Cardiff’s first win in six games as supporters began the latest series of planned protests against Vinent Tan’s controversial rebrand.

It marked the lowest Bluebirds crowd since they moved from Ninian Park to their new home in 2009.

It made for an eerie atmosphere, and did little to help a home side struggling for confidence after a miserable recent run that had seen them ship 13 goals in four games.

Cardiff manager Russell Slade said of the poor attendance: 'I can’t make people come and watch the team.

'I am sure if we start winning football matches and get some momentum from this game then people will come back.

'But it is difficult for the players. You wouldn’t want to see this for a league game as you want an atmosphere and for it to be very difficult for the opposition when they come here.

'But there are factors I cannot control.'

 There was little for either goalkeeper to do until Cardiff took the lead in the 34th minute.

Tom Eastman’s poor clearing header fell to Ralls on the edge of the area and the midfielder found the net in fortuitous fashion.

His initial strike was on target, but would not have beaten Colchester keeper Sam Walker without deflections off both Kaspars Gorkss and Cole Kpekawa.

Tom Adeyemi went close to doubling their lead as he dispossessed Sammy Szmodics and drove towards goal, only to see his low shot tipped round the post by the scurrying Walker.

Szmodics almost atoned for his error instantly. His foraging run down the left took him to the edge of the Cardiff box where his clever lay-off found Gavin Massey.

The striker looked certain to level but a superb full-length stop from Simon Moore preserved Cardiff’s lead.

The miss proved costly to Colchester’s hopes of an upset and Cardiff moved further ahead eight minutes into the second half.

Harris improvised brilliantly to dispatch an acrobatic volley into the bottom corner for his first Cardiff goal after Ben Turner had headed a Peter Whittingham corner straight up in the air.

Whittingham set up the third on the hour, his pin-point delivery allowed Jones to head home with his first touch after coming on as a substitute.

Sears got Colchester the consolation their visitors deserved as he calmly slotted home his 13th goal of the season from Massey’s lay-off, but it was too little too late.
