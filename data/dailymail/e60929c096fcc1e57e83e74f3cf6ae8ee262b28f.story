All it takes is one burger with a fancy bun to remake a brand.

After launching their new Pretzel Bacon Cheeseburger last month, Wendy's has seen it's stock prices increase 42 per cent, outperforming fast-food competitors McDonald's and Yum Brands (KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell).

When the pretzel burger launched on July 1 stock prices were hovering around $5.90 a share. Based on 393 million shares outstanding, that valued the company at $2.3billion. Yesterday closing prices were up to $7.80 making the company's value a month later $3.1billion, according to Wendy's Vice President of Investor Relations David Poplar.

Big hit: Wall Street analyst Mark Kalinowski called the burger the best-selling new product introduction in the last 10 years

Wall Street analysts are touring the 
launch of the pretzel burger as the best move for the 
fast-food chain in years.

Since
 the burger's launch last month, Mark Kalinowski of Janney Capital 
Market called the burger 'the best-selling new product introduction by 
that burger concept in at least a decade.'

The last time Wendy's stock was this hot was back in 2002 when they marketed a new line of high-end salads.

While the burger is currently a limited-time only affair, if sales continue to rise it could become a permanent fixture on the menu.

This could lead to the development of new menu items using the pretzel bun which could affect Wendy's financial success 'for years to come,' Kalinowski told the New York Post.

Soaring sales: The burger's launch has pushed the fast-food brand ahead of competitors like McDonald's, KFC and Taco Bell on the stock market

Kalinowski estimated in a report this week that Wendy's same-store sales would be up 5.5 per cent by the third quarter of 2013.

Same-store sales are measurements of 
sales using sales figures from current stores, excluding data from new 
store openings and stores that have closed.

The last time the brand saw such an increase was in 2011, with a 5.1 per cent increase in sales over one quarter with the launch of it's Hot 'n Juicy burgers and in 2002 with a line of high-end salads which sparked sales increases of 5 per cent or higher for three quarters.

Wendy's same-store sales have risen the past two years, but 5.5 per cent is more than double last year's 2.7 per cent sales increase.

Part of the burger's success may be in the fact that the fancy bun appeals to millennials.

CEO Emil Brolick and other Wendy's executives have noted that small adjustments like bread can have a big impact on how customers perceive the quality and healthfulness of a chain's food - making them competitors for upscale fast-food chains like Chipotle or Panera Bread which are modeled to appeal to new-age customers.

And Wendy's isn't the only brand focusing on a younger generation of customers.

Long-term: If the burger becomes a permanent item on the menu, Kalinowski predicts financial success for the brand 'for years to come'

Fast-food chains like McDonald's and Taco Bell are implementing new menu items to appeal to a younger set.

McDonald's focus is on adding healthier items, like their new egg-white breakfast sandwich, in an attempt to appeal to calorie-counters between 18 and 32. 

Taco
 Bell, which recently ditched their kids menu to be more 'edgy', is 
focusing more on trendier menu items like their new breakfast taco or 
the Doritos locos tacos.

The pretzel burger takes a bit from both of these approaches. The bun makes it look more upscale, but in reality it's not that healthy.

According to nutritional information on Wendy's website, the burger comes it at 680 calories with a shocking 1,100 mg of sodium.

But calorie counts don't seem to matter too much with recent fast-food menu item launches like the Glazed Donut Breakfast Sandwich at Dunkin' Donuts and the Carl's Jr. Strawberry Pop-Tart Ice Cream Sandwich.

'This could be a very, very big deal,' Christopher Muller, professor of hospitality at Boston University's School of Hospitality Administration, told International Science Times. 'I don't know why, but there's nothing else on the market quite like it. If it's a hit, others are guaranteed to follow.'

Dunkin' Donuts is already planning a pretzel bun menu item of their own. On Monday the coffee chain announced they would be launching a Pretzel Roll Roast Beef sandwich.
