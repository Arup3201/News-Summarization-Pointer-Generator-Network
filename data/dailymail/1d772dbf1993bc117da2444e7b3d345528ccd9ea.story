A row has broken out over school dinners after it emerged reception pupils were being given just one chicken nugget for their lunch.

Infant pupils around the country are all entitled to a free hot meal every lunchtime under the government's flagship scheme brought in this month.

But the quality of the food they are being given was called into question today when the measly meals being served up to the youngest pupils in Birmingham were revealed.

Measly meal: Reception pupils in Birmingham are being given just one chicken nugget with their lunch

City Councillor Valerie Seabright said: 'I welcome free school meals, but I'm seriously concerned having been to see a school that was not the best quality.

'The rations and portions are not brilliant. In reception class, children get just one nugget, Year 1 get two and Year 2 get three or four.

'The whole point is to make sure that children get adequate meals with good nutrition. In one class I went to the children didn't get any fresh vegetables or fruit.

'This is serious. It is not working. I think we should insist that there is more training of staff. They need to know about sizes of rations.'

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg launched plans to give all under-sevens a free meal at lunchtime and the scheme started in schools earlier this month.

But the idea has already suffered setbacks after it emerged some schools had to bus in meals and others were providing cold food for pupils.

Birmingham city councillor Valerie Seabright said she was 'seriously concerned' by the size of the portions

Policy: Nick Clegg visited schools when he launched free hot dinners for all infant pupils earlier this year

Councillor Seabright said council-owned food provider Cityserve - which is responsible for meals at 92 per cent of the city's schools - was leaving youngsters short-changed.

She added: 'It's all very well just saying 'We have free school meals', but you have to be able to implement that policy.

'The children obviously didn't just get the one chicken nugget, there was potato and vegetables on offer too, but I don't know if they should be given this processed food at all.

The British Dietetic Association says boys aged 4-6 years need 1,715 calories a day and girls 1,545. A child's lunch should contain a third of their daily calories.

They need two servings of vegetables a day and two of fruit, four of bread, cereal or potatoes, three of milk and dairy and two of fish or meat.

In basic terms, children of this age should be a getting a plate of food comprising half a plate of vegetables/fruit, a quarter of a plate of protein and a quarter of starchy food such as pasta for their lunch.

'All the children are getting the same money per head so it's a bit naughty of the company to give the reception class less.'

Others in the area pointed out that even if children were given more generous portion of nuggets, the food was unlikely to provide the nutrition children need.

Labour's Barry Bowles said: 'These are processed foods. Why are we not giving them fresh food?'

Birmingham City Council's children's boss has admitted the situation is 'unacceptable' and said bosses are investigating meals provided by Cityserve.

Nutrition expert Mel Wakeman said the vague advice schools are given for dinners alow them to serve up inadequate meals.

She said: 'The way the guidelines are worded, children could potentially have two portions of fried food and two pastry based meals a week, which would be too much.

'I don't think we should just get rid of all the food children like because we have to be realistic, they just won't eat what is put in front of them if it's really boring.

'But with things like chicken nuggets, I don't think they should have that kind of fried food more than once a week.'

The new scheme came after a high-profile campaign by celebrity chef Jamie Oliver

The idea of free school meals for infant pupils was recommended in a review of school food by the Leon restaurant chain. 

Their inquiry found that packed lunches are usually much less nutritious than cooked meals, and said a better diet would improve children's performance in the classroom.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg launched the plan at last autumn's Liberal Democrat conference.

The government has assigned £2.30 for each meal served to pupils and also says it is ploughing £150million into upgrading school kitchens.

Previously, only students with parents earning less than £16,000 were entitled to the  food, but more than 1.5million children can now eat for free.

But critics have said schools were given too little time and money to prepare for the changes.

The National Union of Teachers also wants the policy to be extended to all primary pupils.

General secretary Christine Blower says children 'do not stop being hungry at seven years of age'.
