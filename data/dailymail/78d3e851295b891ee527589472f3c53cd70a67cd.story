An ancient fresh water lake on Mars could have sustained life on the red planet billions of years ago.

Mudstones from Gale Crater, the landing site of the Curiosity rover, were formed in a lake that may have existed on the planet for hundreds of thousands of years, say scientists.

The 150 kilometre-wide (93-mile) impact basin, with a mountain at its centre, is believed to have supported the lake - and possibly more than one - around 3.6 billion years ago.

The crater formed long after the most recent proposed ice age on Mars, which ended some 400,000 years ago. This is an artist's impression of what a lake on Mars may have looked like

The analysis showed that the lake was 
calm and likely had fresh water, containing key biological elements including carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur.

Such a lake would provide perfect conditions for simple microbial life such as chemolithoautotrophs to thrive in.

On Earth, chemolithoautotrophs are commonly found in caves and around hydrothermal vents. The microbes break down rocks and minerals for energy.

Mudstones generally form in calm conditions. They are created by very fine sediment grains settling layer-by-layer on each other in still water.

Evidence of water on Mars dates back to the Mariner 9 mission, which arrived on Mars in 1971.

Mariner 9 imaging revealed clues of water erosion in river beds and canyons as well as weather fronts and fogs.

Viking orbiters that followed caused a revolution in our ideas about water on Mars by showing how floods of water broke through dams, carved deep valleys, eroded grooves into bedrock, and traveled thousands of kilometres.

Mars is currently in the middle of an ice age, so liquid water cannot exist on its surface at the present time. However, the planet seems to have been warmer and wetter in the past.

In June this year, Curiosity rover found Powerful evidence that water good enough to drink once flowed on Mars.

In September, the first scoop of soil analysed by Curiosity revealed that fine materials on the surface of the planet contain two per cent water by weight.

The finding was made by a team of researchers from Nasa's Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Curiosity Rover mission, which includes a member from Imperial College London.

The mudrocks were at a site named Yellowknife Bay in Gale Crater, near the Martian equator.

These revealed that Gale Crater, a 150km wide impact basin with a mountain at its center, sustained at least one lake around 3.6 billion years ago.

Professor Sanjeev Gupta, a member of the MSL mission at Imperial College London said: 'It is important to note that we have not found signs of ancient life on Mars.

'What we have found is that Gale Crater was able to sustain a lake on its surface at least once in its ancient past that may have been favourable for microbial life, billions of years ago.

'This is a huge positive step for the exploration of Mars.

'It is exciting to think that billions of years ago, ancient microbial life may have existed in the lake's calm waters, converting a rich array of elements into energy.

'The next phase of the mission, where we will be exploring more rocky outcrops on the crater's surface, could hold the key whether life did exist on the red planet.'

In previous studies, Professor Gupta and the MSL team have found evidence of water on Mars' surface in other rocks such as conglomerates.

However, the new research provides the strongest evidence yet that Mars could have been habitable enough for life to take hold.

The team analysed the geology and chemistry of the mudstones by drilling into the rock using the MSL six-wheeled science laboratory, which is remotely operated by the MSL team from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena in the USA.

The next step will see the team using the rover to explore Gale Crater for further evidence of ancient lakes or other habitable environments in the thick pile of sedimentary rocks scattered across the crater's surface.

The findings are published in the journal Science.
