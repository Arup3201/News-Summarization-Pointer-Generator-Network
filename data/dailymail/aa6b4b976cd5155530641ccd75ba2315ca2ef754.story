Houston Texans head coach Gary Kubiak was rushed to hospital after collapsing pitchside at half-time during his team's 27-24 defeat by the Indianapolis Colts.

As Kubiak headed back to the locker room with his side 21-3 up at the break, he collapsed forward by the 20-yard line at Reliant Stadium.

He was quickly surrounded by medical staff and taken off the field on a stretcher, before being loaded into an ambulance.

On Monday, NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported that Kubiak suffered a mini stroke on Sunday night.

The game was televised in the US by NBC,
whose touchline reporter Michelle Tafoya was nearby when the incident 
happened and reported that Kubiak 'was speaking, but also looked to be 
in extraordinary pain'.

'He had an episode; he was light-headed and dizzy,' Houston general manager Rick Smith said in an interview on NBC after the game. 'He was evaluated by a number of specialists ... he is awake and coherent.

'He went to a knee, and they laid him on the ground. He is stable; for precautionary reasons we wanted to get him to the hospital. We have to assess ... obviously, there's a lot of info. Hopefully, Gary will be back with us tomorrow.'

Tafoya added that the 52-year-old 'could not open his eyes' as he was treated on the sideline.

After the game, Texans defensive coordinator Phillips said: 'Everybody saw he (Kubiak) went down at half-time. The doctors and our medical staff took care of him and he went to a local hospital. All the vital signs are good, he did not have a heart attack but they're still checking everything.'

On fire: Houston quarterback Case Keenum fired a 62-yard and a 41-yard pass to Johnson for touchdowns

Andrew Luck got off to a slow start

The Colts took their first lead of 
the game when Hilton grabbed a nine-yard touchdown reception and Coby 
Fleener caught the two-point conversion to make it 27-24 with four minutes 
left.

Houston built their 
half-time lead on Keenum's three touchdown passes to Andre Johnson. 
Johnson had 190 yards receiving at half-time, but just 39 yards after 
that.

The Colts scored nine
points in the third quarter, highlighted by a 10-yard touchdown pass 
from Luck to Hilton on a third-and-10 to make it 24-12, before going on 
to win.

Phillips refused to use Kubiak’s collapse as an excuse for his team’s second-half woes, saying: 'I look at the second half and we had our opportunities. The ball game came down to them playing well, especially at crunch time, and we didn’t. We made all the big plays in the first half, they made the big plays second half.'
