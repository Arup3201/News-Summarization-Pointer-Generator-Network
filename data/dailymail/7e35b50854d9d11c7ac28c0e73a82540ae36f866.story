James Corden gave the fastest interview of his life when he was taken for a spin by Formula One star Lewis Hamilton.

The actor and comedian was given one lap to ask Hamilton as many questions as he could while the Mercedes driver hit speeds of 150mph.

Corden was thrown from side to side but tried to keep his composure as he asked Hamilton a series of questions at Rockingham Circuit in Northamptonshire.

It wasn't exactly a revealing and in-depth interview, but Hamilton did admit that his favourite football player is Barcelona forward Lionel Messi.

The 29-year-old also denied that he sleeps while wearing his race helmet but, when asked who his hero was, he replied: 'my dad'.

After a couple of doughnuts, Corden stepped out of the car and said: 'I can't feel my legs, that was ridiculous.'
