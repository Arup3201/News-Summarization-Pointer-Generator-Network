Helge Lund is in line to receive a massive £25million pay package as the new boss of BG Group

Pressure is mounting on the board of one of Britain’s biggest energy firms to scale back a controversial £25million pay package for its new boss.

BG Group plans to lavish Norwegian executive Helge Lund with a £12million ‘golden hello’ on top of his annual £13million package.

The deal was approved by the company’s board, which includes disgraced Iraq war diplomat Sir David Manning and former private equity boss Baroness Hogg.

But it has been condemned as ‘excessive and inflammatory’ by business groups. Now it has emerged that the company’s pay committee – which is made up of five directors including BG chairman Andrew Gould – were themselves paid £1.2million last year. Mr Gould earns £727,000 a year.

The committee, which is responsible for deciding the firm’s pay policies, recommended the £12million package to the rest of the board – which approved it unanimously.

The chairman of the pay committee, John Hood, is the former vice chancellor of Oxford University. He will be paid £153,000 this year in total. The other members are paid between £98,000 and £115,000 – although the firm admits it also relies on ‘expert’ external pay consultants.

Former UK chairman at investment banking giant Credit Suisse, Mark Seligman, is part of the committee along with chemical industry veteran Patrick Thomas and Vivienne Cox, who also sits on the ministerial advice board of the Department for International Development.

Yesterday, Professor Hugh Willmott from Cass Business School attacked the ‘self-regulating elite’ of boardroom directors who set each other’s salaries.

Directors have failed to ‘exercise executive restraint’ in waving through the eye-watering package, he said.

He added: ‘Like a ring of traders, the market for executives is effectively rigged by the small number of players within it.’

A vote is being held on December 12 to approve the £12million package for the new head of BG Group, which is British Gas’s former oil and gas division.

But two of BG’s largest shareholders have already criticised the pay plans. Corporate governance group ShareAction has started a scheme where the public can contact their pension fund and find out how they will vote next month.

ShareAction boss Catherine Howard said: ‘BG Group directors very likely met privately with major investors to ask them if they would stomach this pay package, and came away thinking they’d get away with it.’

Simon Walker, of the Institute of Directors, has described the arrangement as ‘excessive, inflammatory and contrary to the principles of good governance’.

BG Group has defended its offer to Mr Lund, who currently earns £2.5million a year for leading much larger rival Norwegian state-backed oil giant Statoil.

A spokesman said: ‘His proposed remuneration is competitive in the international oil and gas industry.’

John Hood, the former vice-chancellor of Oxford, is among the board members of BG Group

Among the BG board members are:

John Hood

He also sits on the boards of advertising giant WPP and nuclear fuel group Urenco and is president of medical research charity Robertson Foundation.

In 2004 he was appointed vice-chancellor of Oxford, where he faced significant opposition for trying to unpick the university’s historic management structure.

David Manning

The former diplomat commands an annual fee of £102,000 for his part-time position on the BG Group board. He was a foreign policy adviser to Tony Blair during New Labour’s ‘sofa government’ years and was a key figure in the hugely controversial run up to the Iraq war.

Baroness Hogg

Labour peer Baroness Hogg has worked in politics, private equity and broadcasting. Under her tenure as chairman, Britain’s biggest private equity group 3i racked up poor investments that saw its chief executive ousted by shareholders. She was paid £120,000 for her role at BG last year.
