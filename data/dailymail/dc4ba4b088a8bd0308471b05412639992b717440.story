Mike Ashley's dramatic bid to oust Rangers chief executive Graham Wallace could thwart an initial £16million proposal being tabled by an alliance of potential investors including Dave King.

A statement from former director Paul Murray and shareholder George Letham – two figureheads of the investment group – confirmed last night they have been in detailed discussions with the Ibrox board.

Sportsmail believes their proposal involves an up-front investment of around £16m – close to the current market value of the club - in return for a 51 per cent stake acquired via a new share issue. That would see them take control of the boardroom, with further investments then staggered to move closer to the £30m-plus King has previously stated it will take to restore Rangers.

‘We confirm that we are in discussions with the Board regarding a proposal to provide the Club with a funding package to be provided by like-minded individuals including Dave King,’ said a statement from Murray and Letham.

‘The discussions should remain private and confidential and we will provide more details in due course.’

The potential success of those talks has, however, been thrown into serious doubt by Ashley’s bid to remove Wallace and ally Philip Nash as directors. Both are perceived as being favourable towards the plan the King group are putting forward.

Ashley raised his stake at Ibrox to 8.9 per cent last week and is now seeking an extraordinary general meeting at which a resolution to axe Wallace and financial expert Nash would be voted upon by shareholders.

Rangers were last night assessing whether the request from the Newcastle United owner was ‘properly constituted’. Should it be deemed valid and an EGM ballot take place, the board have vowed to fight Ashley’s motion.

The move has been described by one source close to Ibrox as a ‘full-fronted attack’ on the only two members of the board with previous experience of running football clubs – Wallace through his time as chief financial officer at Manchester City and Nash via spells at Liverpool and Arsenal.

It also provides clear evidence that Ashley will fight to have an influential say in the future of Rangers as he seeks to protect his commercial interests. His Sports Direct firm already have retail contracts in place, while he also owns – but has yet to activate – naming rights for the stadium.

Ashley has amassed an estimated £4billion from his business interests and would seem to be confident of landing the backing of more than 50 per cent of shareholders for his proposed shake-up.

Sandy Easdale, chairman of the football board at Rangers, has previously spoken of his support for Ashley’s greater involvement. He carries the voting rights for a 26.15 per cent chunk of Ibrox shares.

A spokesman for Easdale would only say that he was watching the latest development ‘with interest’ but the backing of his voting block would see Ashley move within 15 per cent of his target.

Ashley currently owns 8.9 per cent of the Scottish club, but is interested in increasing that stake

Hedge fund Laxey Partners are the largest single shareholder at Rangers with a 16.3 per cent stake. Non-executive director Norman Crighton is their representative and approved the Stock Exchange statement which said the board was ‘united’ in its support for Wallace and Nash. However, observers will recall Laxey effectively switching sides during the boardroom battle that eventually ended in victory for the incumbents at the club’s previous AGM.

This year’s AGM must take place before December 31, but Ashley’s decision not to wait for that meeting could be viewed as a bid to cut off the King group at the pass.

The Londoner declined to invest in last month’s stop-gap open offer that raised £3.13m. However, he then more than doubled his stake with an £850,000 purchase from fund managers Hargreave Hale – a decision which kept his money away from a Rangers board battling another imminent crisis. The Ibrox cash reserves are expected to run dry before the end of the year.

It’s understood Ashley held talks with the Rangers board about providing a loan prior to the open offer. Those discussions reportedly broke down over a demand to include trademark rights as a condition. Closing off King could, though, leave finance from Ashley as the clearest option left available to Rangers.

In terms of purchasing shares, the tycoon is currently limited to a 10 per cent stake at Ibrox through an agreement struck with the SFA as part of their rules on dual ownership of clubs. There could be an application for the board of the governing body to consider raising that limit, provided it was backed by a detailed business case.

Responding to the EGM demand from Ashley, the Rangers board said yesterday: ‘If valid, the board intends to seek to have such notice withdrawn in order to avoid the cost and disruption of an ad hoc general meeting particularly given the company’s forthcoming annual general meeting, further details of which will be announced in due course.

‘The board is united in its support of the executive team. If the notice is valid and is not withdrawn, the directors intend to recommend that shareholders vote against the proposed resolutions. A further announcement will be made shortly.’
