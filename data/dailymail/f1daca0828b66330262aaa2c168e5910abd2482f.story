Under current laws should a Queen marry a woman she would automatically be given the title of King

Changes are to be made to the way royal titles are granted in order to stop a man becoming a Queen or a woman a king in light of next month's same-sex marriage law.

Under the current rules if Britain were to have a gay king, his husband would be statutorily be made a Queen. Likewise a Queen's same-sex consort would be a king.

And if a future prince of Wales were to marry a man, his husband would automatically be grated the title princess of Wales.

Civil servants have trawled through dozens of statutes and regulations going back as far as 1285 in what legal experts have described as a 'tidying-up' exercise, the Daily Telegraph reports.

The changes will extend to dukes, earls and other male peers in order to prevent a same-sex husband becoming a duchess, countess or lady.

However fervent equal rights campaigners may be disappointed because while it will remain high treason to commit adultery with a king's wife or queen's husband that will not be the case with a same–sex consort.

Proposed amendments to 36 Acts dating back to 1859 and a further 67 pieces of legislation dating back 729 years, are to be set out in a draft order.

They will cover exclusions from the effects of the Same–Sex Marriage Act as well as changes to pension regulations.

A clause in the Act which gives gay and heterosexual marriage the same legal force will not apply to anyone 'who marries, or who is married to, the king regnant, to the title of queen'.

However the Coalition for Marriage, which
 is campaigning against gay marriage, said the changes showed what a 
'complete mess', the act has made of the law.

Spokesman Colin Hart told the Telegraph: 'We repeatedly warned that the Government's plans were ill thought out, complicated and would have a damaging effect.

'Just a few months later we have ministers engaged in an unprecedented and systematic drive to airbrush out of law words like husband, wife and widow in order to make the legislation work.

'It is clear the Government is in a complete mess.'
