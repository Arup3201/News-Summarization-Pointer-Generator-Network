There's not many places where you would find a merry-go-round styled after a ballistic missile. But here they take an unnerving pride in military technology.

In case you haven't guessed already, it is, of course, North Korea.

Of course, there are no children actually enjoying the ride in a Pyongyang park, for in the isolated totalitarian dictatorship state-sanctioned leisure time is strictly rationed.

Military first: A groundskeeper walks past a merry-go-round made to look like the North Korean Unha-3 rocket at a park in 
Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea

'Lets open up an era to a strong economic country': A propaganda poster showing the launch of space rockets stands next to a walled off Pyongyang construction site

Taking a break: A North Korean man sits next to his bicycle on the bank of a river as the sun sets over the unfinished 105-storey Ryugyong Hotel in Pyongyang

Health and safety nightmare: North Korean soldiers work on the side of a high rise building apparently under construction in Pyongyang

These are the latest photographs of the insular country taken by David Guttenfelder, an Associated Press photographer who has enjoyed unusual access inside North Korea.

Vastly different from the stage managed mass events which are usually seen in pictures released by North Korea's own state-run press, the cityscapes they show are curiously deserted, with little indication as to why save for the possibility that most of the country's population are undoubtedly hard at work.

Elsewhere, a woman is pictured walking past the outer shell of a construction site. Above it looms a propaganda billboard depicting the launch of North Korean rockets.

It reads: 'Lets open up an era to a strong economic country.'

Respite comes rarely for the people of Democratic People's Republic of Korea - as it's officially known. But one of the pictures shows North Koreans at a carnival, aiming airguns for a target shooting game.

It is an appropriate diversion for the world's most militarised society, with a total of 9,495,000 active, reserve, and paramilitary personnel, meaning that more than a third of its residents are under orders.

Secretive: A North Korean tour guide stands on the top of Juche Tower in Pyongyang and looks down at the capital city, half hiding from the photographer's lens

Mr Guttenfelder's photographs offer a rare insight into life in North Korea, but even a regular visitor like him is accompanied every step of his way around the country by government guides.

He has managed to capture a photograph of one in one of his pictures.

A female dressed in flowing blue clothing, half hiding around a corner, it seems she is not aware she is the subject of the photograph, which ostensibly shows the Pyonyang cityscape from the top of the city's Juche Tower.
