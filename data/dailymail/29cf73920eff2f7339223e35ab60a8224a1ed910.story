A drunken Chinese man who was shot at point-blank range  survived because the bullet wedged in the smartphone he was carrying in his shirt pocket.

Han Peng had been drinking with friends at a karaoke bar in the northern Taiwanese city of Hsinchu when he got into a fight with another customer and was suddenly fired at.

The 47 year old was taken to hospital following the altercation, but only suffered a bruise and a small cut because the bullet was stopped by the phone's plastic casing.  

Lucky escape: Han Peng survived a point-blank range gun shot because the bullet became wedged in his mobile phone, which he was carrying in his shirt pocket

The row began when Han's friend spotted a wallet on the floor belonging to Hsu Shen, 48, and picked it up before shouting to everyone in the bar: 'The next round is on me.' 

Hsu failed to see the funny side, so he went over to the group and they started arguing.

The confrontation quickly turned into a punch-up, prompting to Han intervene try and calm Hsu down.

According to bar owner Li Fan, Han left the bar and came back 10 minutes later carrying a gardening sickle and marched across the bar towards Hsu.

Li Fan added: 'Everyone was stunned when the other man pulled out a gun and fired it at point-blank range at the man waving the sickle.  

He added: 'I got the impression he only wanted to terrorise his rival and was really quite shocked when he was suddenly shot. He had turned round and ran out to an emergency exit, closely followed by everybody else.'

Survived: The 47-year-old victim (pictured) escaped with cuts and bruises after he was fired at by customer Hsu Shen, 48

Han's friends found him outside a short while later and took him to a hospital where doctors confirmed that, apart from bruising and a small cut, he was otherwise unharmed.

They said had the telephone in his top pocket not stopped the bullet, he probably would have died.

The shooter ran off after the incident but later turned himself in together with the handgun.

Police are now investigating whether it was self defence or attempted murder, and confirmed that the shooter will in any case face charges of having an illegal firearm.

Protected: The bullet penetrated the cover, but it became wedged in the phone as it sat in his top pocket
