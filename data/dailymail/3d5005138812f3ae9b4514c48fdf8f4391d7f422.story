The latest rumours about the iPhone 6 may be the clearest evidence yet that Apple is working on a super-thin device.

Taiwan-based site Digitimes claims the iPhone 6’s battery will be just 2mm thick - a millimetre thinner than the current battery in the iPhone 5S and 5C.

It also reported that component makers are similarly reducing the thickness of panels and chassis for the upcoming handset.

Apple's iPhone 6 is rumoured to come in a slim 'Air' version.

Up
 until August last year, Huawei was the record-holder for the thinnest 
phone in the world with its Ascend P6, at 0.24 inches (6.18 
millimetres).

This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 0.23 inches (5.75 millimetres). 

By
 comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 0.3 inches (7.6 
millimetres), while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 0.295 inches 
(7.5 millimetres).

Samsung's Galaxy S5 is 0.32 inches (8.1 millimetres) thick, while the HTC One M8 is 0.37 inches (9.4 millimetres).

However, this is said to be causing production problems because of the fragile nature of such components.

Rumours suggest Apple is working on two versions of different sizes, with one being 4.7 inches (11.9cm) diagonally, the same size as the HTC One.

A larger version is also expected to be released, measuring 5.5 inches (14cm) - slightly larger than Samsung's 5.1-inch Galaxy S5.

Previous rumours have pointed to a super slim 'iPhone Air' model, which is expected to be the smaller handset.

In April, Taiwan-based Commercial Times similarly referenced a 2mm-thick battery.

Apple surprised a number of people last year when it unveiled its super-thin iPad Air (pictured) which is 20% thinner than previous models

It would follow the release of Apple’s super-thin iPad Air last year, which, at 0.2-inches (7.5mm) thick, is 2mm thinner than the iPad 4’s 0.4-inch (9.4mm) depth.

Two concept images released earlier this year depicted Apple’s next-generation handset with a slender chassis, as well as a larger 5-inch screen similar to those seen on the Samsung Galaxy S4 and HTC One.

The first concept predicted the phone will be 4.5mm thick.

While the second went a step further showing the device as 1.5mm at the top and 3mm at the bottom.

By comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 0.2 inches (7.6mm).

The iPad Air is slightly thinner at 7.5mm.

In order to make the Apple phone super-thin, the second concept suggested doing away with the physical home button in place of touchscreen keys.

Sources also told Aaron Lee at Digitimes that rival Samsung has similarly created a thin battery, at just 0.06 inches (1.65mm) thick, but hasn’t added it to any products yet.

Reports this week suggested Apple’s larger phablet-style device will launch next year, after problems with the display panel set production back by months.
