It is any musician's worst nightmare - feeling the need to sneeze mid-performance.

And for this poor trombone player, that nightmare became a reality - and ended with rather embarrassing consequences.

At first, all seems well during the concert - held at St Luke's Parish Church in Tiptree, Essex.

One performer with the London Central Fellowship Band couldn't hold in a sneeze while performing at St Luke's Parish Church in Tiptree, Essex

But disaster strikes when the unnamed member of the London Central Fellowship Band gets ambitious - and decides he can persevere despite feeling the need to sneeze.

And, thinking he can hold it in, the musician powers through - momentarily at least.

Unfortunately, his ambition gets him nowhere - and he sneezes into his instrument, making a loud trumping noise mid-way through the rendition.

Ever professional, the band continue without falling about laughing.

In fact, the conductor barely seems to notice - carrying on without batting and eyelid.

A video-friendly member of the audience who taped the concert decided to upload the hilarious footage onto YouTube.

It has now been watched over 650,000 times.

One YouTube user noted the man's sneeze sounded rather like an elephant.

Another, who goes by the name Dieselboy914, expressed sympathy - writing: ‘I play trombone, and this has happened to me, too.

'It’s almost unavoidable, you never feel it coming.’

Even the London Symphony Orchestra has commented, adding: ' We've all been there: it's a quiet passage and you really really need to sneeze.

The video has gone viral - with some internet pranksters using the footage to make a variety of comical films, including this one featuring a startled baby elephant

'Try to ignore and keep playing, or disrupt the music to stop and sneeze? This is what happens when you don't quite make it...﻿'

Unfortunately for the red-faced trombone player, the embarrassment doesn't stop there.

Now, internet pranksters have taken it upon themselves to make parody videos of the mortifying accident.

Perhaps taking note of the YouTube user's elephant comparison, one video features a pack of the animals walking together.

And when a baby elephant is startled the man's sneeze replaces what one can assume was the sound of the animal making a trumping noise.
