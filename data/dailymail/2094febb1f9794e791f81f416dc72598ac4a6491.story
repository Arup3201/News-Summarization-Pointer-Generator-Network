'Predator': Danielle Reed, 23, a Florida high school teacher, apparently made up a fake son so she could have a male student sleep over at her home

A high school English teacher has been charged after she had sex with a male student, authorities said.

Danielle Reed, 23, allegedly made up a teenager called 'Josh' and told her victim's mother that she was bringing him to her home so the boys could have a sleepover.

Reed, who taught at Atlantic Coast High School in Jacksonville, Florida was arrested on November 9 after the boy, who cannot be identified, finally revealed to his mother what had happened.

The relationship reportedly ended in June after four months.

Reed's victim is believed to be a minor, aged between 12 and 18. 

The teacher is believed to have driven to her student's house to pick up the boy, where his mother allowed him to go, according to First Coast News.

Gossip about the alleged affair spread around the high school via Facebook and Twitter on Friday.

The principal later released a letter to parents saying that such behavior would not be tolerated at the school.

Reed, who lives alone with her dog, was charged with sexual battery and bond set at $150,006.

She is being held by the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office until her next court appearance on December 3. 

According to a spokesman at Atlantic school, whose motto is 'making waves toward greatness', Reed had worked at the school since August 2011.
