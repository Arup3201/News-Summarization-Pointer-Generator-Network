A haul of jewellery worth £110,000 which was seized from the ringleader of a £26million tobacco smuggling operation has gone under the hammer.

The collection included a luxurious nine-carat diamond ring valued at £40,000 and four jewel-encrusted designer wristwatches collectively worth £30,000.

Also among the 30 lots was a 4.5 carat single-stone ring worth £8,000, a pair of seven-carat diamond earrings worth £15,000 and a bizarre solid gold baby’s dummy worth £500.

The haul of jewellery worth £110,000 which was seized from Daniel Harty - the ringleader of a £26million tobacco smuggling operation - is set to go under the hammer later this month

The bizarre solid gold baby's dummy worth £500 was also confiscated from Harty - the mastermind of a criminal gang jailed for smuggling 150 million cigarettes and two tonnes of low quality tobacco into the UK

The gold baby's dummy worth £500, pictured, was one of the many expensive items of jewellery seized from Harty on his arrest in early 2011 under the Proceeds of Crime Act

The items were confiscated from Daniel Harty, the mastermind of a criminal gang jailed for smuggling 150 million cigarettes and two tonnes of low quality tobacco into the UK.

Harty created a distribution network around the north of England transporting cigarettes to warehouses, storage yards and farms.

The shipments were then broken down into smaller loads and delivered to towns and cities across the UK to sell on the black market.

Daniel Harty, 30, from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, was jailed in June last year for four and a half years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to evade excise duty

His eight-man gang evaded paying £26million of duty.

Harty, 30, from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, was jailed in June last year for four and a half years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to evade excise duty.

The jewellery was seized from Harty on his arrest in early 2011 under the Proceeds of Crime Act. A judge ordered it should be sold to satisfy a £330,000 confiscation order.

Elizabeth Dashper, director of Sheffield Auction Gallery which is now selling the items, said it will be the second time they have sold goods seized under the Proceeds of Crime act.

She said: ‘We are used to selling 
valuable items of jewellery but it is unusual to find such an impressive
 collection of luxury items from one vendor.

‘We are pleased to be able to assist South Yorkshire Police in maximising the potential sale value.

‘Pre-auction interest on this unique collection is expected to be substantial.

‘The
 auction is being held live on the internet in real time enabling 
potential buyers to bid from wherever they are in the world.’

Four jewel-encrusted designer wristwatches collectively worth £30,000 are part of the haul which will go under the hammer at Sheffield Auction Gallery on March 21

Elizabeth Dashper, director of Sheffield Auction Gallery which is now selling the items, said: 'It is unusual to find such an impressive collection of luxury items from one vendor'

Graham Wragg, fraud manager for South 
Yorkshire Police, said: ‘Both South Yorkshire Police and HMRC had an 
interest in this individual and worked in partnership to secure his 
conviction.

‘The courts 
have ordered he should realise all his available assets to repay his 
benefit from crime and to ensure that he does not profit in any way from
 his offending.’

The auction is being held at Sheffield Auction Gallery on March 21.
