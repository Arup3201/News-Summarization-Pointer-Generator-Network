It has been a year since Kaitlin Roig-DeBellis saved the lives of 15 children, as she barricaded her pupils in a tiny bathroom at Connecticut's Sandy Hook Elementary School.

The teacher doesn't know if Adam Lanza ever entered her classroom, but her quick thinking  undoubtedly saved the lives of her pupils as they huddled together terrified.

The 30-year-old, who has taken nearly a year off work, recalled the terrifying sounds during the 11-minute shooting that killed 26 people, including 20 six and seven year olds.

Survivor: Kaitlin Roig-DeBellis has taken time away from teaching after barricading her class in a bathroom during the Sandy Hook shooting

'I am so aware that roles 
could have so easily been reversed,' Mrs Roig-DeBellis, who could hear gunfire and terrified pleas from the hallway and neighboring classroom, said.

'I remember, in the days after, it was so hard to get out of bed,' she said, as she sat on a sofa in her Greenwich, Connecticut home.

'I just walked around singing Amazing Grace just over and over and over, because it was just so incredibly hard.'

'In my mind constantly is what my students went through, and I think about the lives that were lost. So it’s not so much a realization that a year has passed. It truly is a constant, all the time,' she told the Daily Telegraph.

The December 14 tragedy at Sandy Hook, among the most deadly school shootings in U.S. history, rocked the leafy, suburban town 70 miles northeast of New York City.

Coming just five months after a gunman opened fire in a Colorado movie theater, killing 12, the murder of 20 six and seven-year-olds forced a national reckoning about gun violence.

Lanza, a 20-year-old loner who appears to have had severe emotional problems, used guns that had been bought legally by his mother, Nancy.

Never forget: Families of the 26 victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting have started a website, MySandyHookFamily.org to honor their loved ones

20 students who were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School last 
December

Tribute: Crosses and a Star of David were erected in memory of the victims

He killed her in her bed, then drove to the elementary school he had once attended, shooting his way in just as the school day was getting started. After the rampage, he shot himself.

When he entered the school, Mrs Roig-DeBellis's class was seated in a circle, sharing their holiday traditions.

'I
 got up, I closed the door, I turned the lights off and I turned to my 
students and I said: "We need to get into the bathroom - right now",' 
she said.

Mark Barden, who lost his son, Daniel, gives a long pause when asked about forgiveness.

'I'm trying to approach every bit of this with an open heart and an open mind,' Mr Barden said. 'It's a work in progress.'

Like
 many other Sandy Hook parents, Mr Barden has kept up a punishing 
schedule in the past year, traveling to Washington to meet lawmakers to 
support a gun law that stalled in the Senate, and promoting the 
work of Sandy Hook Promise.

'Maybe
 it has saved me,' he said of the group. 'The way that Daniel lived his 
short life, I know that he would have done a whole lot of good. We take 
it very seriously now that it's our responsibility to do that good 
work.'

For Mr Barden, every day is an anniversary. The 
last haircut. The last swim team practice. The last Thanksgiving.

'A
 lot of the memories are happy. But we're still so new at this. It's 
still so early on that it's hard not to get caught up in the grief,' he 
said.

The bathroom was 
not more than 3ft by 4ft, too small to even hold a sink. 
Children climbed on to the toilet, behind the toilet. One perched on the 
toilet paper dispenser.

Mrs Roig-DeBellis used a storage unit to barricade the door.

'They were hearing exactly what I was hearing. It was extremely loud. It was extremely scary,' she said.

'I said to them, I said I need you to know that I love you all very much,' she told ABC News earlier this year.

'I thought that was the last thing they were ever going to hear. I thought we were all going to die.'

About 45 minutes later, when the police arrived, Mrs Roig-DeBellis would not let 
them in.

'I didn't believe them. I told them if they were cops, they could get the key,' she said.

For days after, she was in a daze, unsure if she was alive or 
dead.

She ended up taking 
more than a year off from teaching, and has devoted that time to 
Classes4Classes, a charity that promotes acts of kindness between 
groups of students.

She plans to return to teaching 
this summer. 'What happened that day has nothing to do with being a teacher,' she said.

The 
shootings shocked the nation and led President Obama to propose a
 series of new gun-control measures, including an expansion of federal 
background-check laws.

Those efforts were blocked in the U.S. Senate 
after some lawmakers argued the changes would be onerous to law-abiding 
gun owners.

Nightmare: Children are led out of the Sandy Hook elementary school after the shooting

In a report
 released last month, state investigators said Lanza acted alone. His motive and reason for targeting Sandy Hook, a
 school he once attended, remain a mystery, the report said.

As the nation prepares to mark the first anniversary of the massacre, Newtown has asked the public to stay away.

For her part, Mrs Roig-DeBellis has planned a trip - a spa visit and maybe a dinner - anything to turn her focus from the excruciating sadness of that day.

'It’s the first thing I think of, I think of it all day long, and it’s the last thing I think of before I go to bed,' she said.

After the attack, parents' group 
Sandy Hook Promise opened up to help families who lost children, and to 
campaign against gun violence.

The parents often talk about their struggle to break through the 
feeling of helplessness. Parent Together, an effort Sandy Hook Promise 
began in November, works to show people, regardless of their politics, 
that gun violence can be prevented.

'Nobody's pro gun violence. So, it's not like there's two sides to this,' Mark Barden, who lost his son Daniel, said.

'If
 we can save another family from going through what we are going 
through, then I can feel good about that for the rest of my life,' he 
added.

Residents have asked the media to stay away as they mark a year since the attack.

Terrified: As Adam Lanza carried out his attack, Kaitlin and her class huddled in silence, listening to the gunfire and pleas for help

Traumatic: For days after the shooting Kaitlin says she was in a daze as she tried to come to terms with what happened

First Selectman Pat Llodra said on Monday: 'We
 can't choose to not have this horrible thing happen to us. It happened.
 We cannot make it un-happen ... But we can choose how we 
react to it.'

'We 
don't need to be reminded. We don't need to relive it. We live it every 
day. We carry it with us,' she added.

The families of victims have created a website, Mysandyhookfamily.org, to honor their loved ones.

The website is intended to create a 'singular place of sharing, communication, and contact with the families of those who lost their lives that day.'
