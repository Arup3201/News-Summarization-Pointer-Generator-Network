Jeremy Clarkson has claimed the Falklands number plate scandal was not deliberate by saying if it was the BBC would have fired him.

The Top Gear presenter – along with co-hosts James May and Richard Hammond, and their crew – had to flee Argentina last week after locals were angered by a number plate on a Porsche he was driving. They believed the plate, ‘H982 FKL’, was in reference to the 1982 Falklands War.  

Clarkson said had his employer thought he was in on the controversy he would have lost his job.

Clarkson said the show had the choice of only two Porsche and chose one based on its colour alone

Writing in The Sun, Clarkson said: 'I don't think it's a secret that BBC boss Danny Cohen and I don't get on.

'And if he thought for one moment that I was in some way responsible for the whole sorry affair, I'd be out on my ear.'

He said his employer had 'done all the digging', checked dates and who purchased the car and why, and for once 'for once Top Gear has done nothing wrong'.

Clarkson and TV controller, Mr Cohen have had a fractious relationship. 

In August it was revealed that Mr Cohen had launched an investigation into Top Gear after footage was leaked of Clarkson saying 'n****' in an out take. It was one of a number of controversies to hit the show in recent months.

Mr Cohen gave Clarkson a final warning and ordered a review of the show's culture and practices, saying there had been 'some significant issues' on the programme.   

The Porsche 928GT had a licence plate that read H982 FKL which locals believed was in reference to the Falklands War; Clarkson said his crew changed the plate as soon as the controversy was pointed out to them

Recalling how the number plate controversy came about, Clarkson said when he asked the office to find a Porsche 928GT, only two were available. One was grey and the other black.

He said because black 'doesn't work on television' he chose the grey one, and 'didn't even see it' until he arrived in Argentina.

Clarkson went on to say no one in the Top Gear crew realised the potential offence the plate would cause until three days later while they were filming in Chile. Its significance was pointed out to the crew on the internet, the show's executive producer has said.

Government officials were then contacted and asked if the plate would be a problem when they arrived in Ushuaia two weeks later, Clarkson said.

The were told to change it before they arrived, which Clarkson said created continuity issues as the car had already been filmed.

Clarkson said they then formed a 'cunning plan' to make-up for the number plate swap. They created joke plates - saying BE11 END - which they planned to film May and Hammond fitting on the car without his knowledge making him look 'idiotic' when he drove it. 

To make up for continuity issues involving the plates Clarkson said the crew created these joke plates which they were going to put on the car to make him look 'idiotic' when he was driving around

But before the crew had a chance to film the scene they were set upon by an angry mob who threw rocks at their cars.

The H982 FKL plates were then removed, revealing an old personal plate underneath, which they left on, then drove off. The cars were later abandoned. 

An Argentine judge is now reportedly considering whether to begin a criminal inquiry into unauthorised ‘plate changing’ on the vehicle. The offence carries a jail sentence of up to three years.

Clarkson concludes by saying the episode will be aired at Christmas and viewers can make up their own minds about whether the incident happened by chance, or was a made for television stunt. 

Yesterday May said the Porsche had its original number plate, something they had no power over, and that any suggestion they deliberately requested it was 'nonsense'.

He went on to say the plate was 'actually meaningless', saying: 'If you looked at it you have to want to see the meaning.'

And added: 'We weren't thinking about the Falklands War, we were going to do an epic long, very difficult drive, to celebrate V8 cars.

'We wouldn't drudge up a war, especially one in living memory, and make a mockery of the casualties.'
