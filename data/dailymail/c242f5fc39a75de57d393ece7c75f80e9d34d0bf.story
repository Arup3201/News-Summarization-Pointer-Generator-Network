Two thirds of bright teenagers are missing out on key academic GCSEs, school league tables reveal.

More than 111,000 of the 177,000 children who shone in tests at the age of 11 have gone on to study the softer subjects often shunned by employers.

While all pupils must study English, maths and science, the tables suggest schools are steering youngsters toward drama, sociology and vocational qualifications – which are seen as easier to do well in – for their remaining subjects.

schools are letting children down'

Less than four in ten pupils across the state sector sit a GCSE in foreign languages, while just under half opt for geography or history.

The Coalition has introduced a new 
measure to check how many pupils score grades A* to C in English, maths 
and science, as well as a language and a humanities subject such as 
history or geography.

Before
 the introduction of this ‘English Baccalaureate’, the measure was five 
good grades in maths and English and in any three other subjects.

The tables published yesterday show the success rate for thousands of state schools plunged when the EBacc was taken into account. One school scored 92 per cent on the old measure but just 6 per cent on the new. The tables also revealed how low, medium and high achievers performed in their GCSEs last year.

Among the pupils who had surpassed expectations in national curriculum tests at 11, 62.8 per cent – 111,437 – failed to achieve the EBacc. Less than half of this 177,447-strong cohort had been entered for all the EBacc subjects in the first place.

In 285 schools, not a single high achiever gained the award.

Thousands of bright pupils are also effectively going backward in English and maths at secondary school. Some 22,713 – 12.8 per cent – are not making the progress expected of them in English and 26,262 – 14.8 per cent – are not improving sufficiently in maths.

Chris McGovern, a former headmaster and chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said bright children were ‘clearly being failed’.

He added: ‘This is a betrayal of a generation of children who are not being prepared for the 21st century and they’re not being prepared to help sustain this country with the economic challenges it faces.

‘It’s failing children and damaging the country. The consequences will be found out in five, ten years’ time when we’re not producing the engineers and the scientists but we are producing the media studies students.’

Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, said: ‘The emphasis in recent years has been getting as many children as possible up to the floor targets and we haven’t been giving enough attention to our brightest pupils.

‘It’s important that young people study the core subjects because that keeps their options open.

‘Within our system, where schools have been judged in terms of GCSE points, it’s been too easy and too tempting for young people to drift away from the subjects that would be in their best interests.’

Schools Minister Nick Gibb said: ‘Children only have one chance at education. These tables show which schools are letting children down. Heads should be striving to make improvements year on year, and we will not let schools coast with mediocre performance.

‘We are driving up standards right across the board.’

Leap in results: Trevor Dunn, principal of Fyndoune Community School in County Durham, which was the most improved in the country

2011’s bottom school was St Aldhelm’s Academy in Poole, Dorset (left), which saw just 3% of its 115 candidates gain five GCSEs at grades C and above. The most improved school was Fyndoune Community College (right) in Sacriston, Durham. Last year, 80% of pupils achieved five or more GCSEs at grade C and above, compared with just 26% in 2008

The figures showed that 45.6 per cent of ‘medium’ achievers – almost 120,000 – who reached the standard expected of their age in national curriculum tests aged 11 failed to get five good grades in subjects including English and maths. More than 2,800 of the nation’s 3,000 schools had fewer than half their pupils gaining the EBacc standard as well.

Teenagers at selective schools were almost five times as likely to achieve the EBacc than pupils in comprehensives. The figures were 68.1 per cent and 13.7 per cent respectively, according to data released by the Department for Education.

At Woodford County High School for Girls, in Woodford Green, Essex, pupils followed a traditional curriculum long before the EBacc was announced in September 2010.

Headmistress Jo Pomeroy said: ‘We are a selective school and have very bright, motivated students.

We have for some time run a curriculum with a very academic focus. It’s not a response we made to the English Baccalaureate. We did maintain a modern foreign language when the compulsion to do so was removed.’

The bottom school in the 2011 results was St Aldhelm’s Academy in Poole, Dorset. Just 3 per cent of the 115 candidates gained five GCSEs including English and maths at grades C and above.
