A Wyoming woman was killed in a car crash that left her younger sister in a coma.

Madisen Price, 21, and Delanda Price, 18, were in a vehicle on May 14 near Thermopolis with 20-year-old Cody Shinost and 21-year-old Dylan Balstad, according to a report by the Wyoming Highway Patrol.

Victims: Sisters Delanie, left, and Madisen, right, along with two others in their vehicle, sadly were not wearing seat belts at the time of the crash

The car rolled twice and none of the passengers wore seat belts, the report said.

Madisen Price was killed, while Delanie Price and Balstad were taken to Wyoming Medical Center, the report said. Shinost was taken to Hot Springs County Memorial Hospital.

The WHP said both drinking and speed may have been involved, and that 'charges against the driver are pending.'

A GoFundMe page for the Price sisters explains that Delanie was in a coma only 5 days before her high school graduation.

So
 far, the page has raised $18,000 to help cover medical and funeral 
costs for the family. Friends and family have shared messages of support
 on the page.
