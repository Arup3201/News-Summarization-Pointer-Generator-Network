Murdered Meredith Kercher's sister today said she just wanted 'the truth' as she attended a student scholarship ceremony presented in her memory.

Tragic Meredith, 21, was brutally knifed to death just two months into her university programme in the Italian hilltop town of Perugia.

Her sister Stephanie spoke out at the event, which was the first time she had been back in the city since Amanda Knox and Raffaelle Sollecito were cleared of the murder.

Earlier this year Italy's Supreme Court threw out their acquittal and ordered a retrial which is due to begin in the autumn and Stephanie said: 'We are still waiting for answers. We just want the truth.

'It's difficult to speak of forgiveness when there are still so many unanswered questions. To be honest I'm not sure what we are expecting from the retrial - we all have mixed emotions.

'For the time being though I'm happy to be back in Perugia for a happy event. The last time I was here it was under very different circumstances. It's nice to be here for this scholarship in Meredith's memory.

'Meredith loved Perugia - I remember her telling us all about the chocolate festival when she first got here. She was so happy here - then a few weeks later we came over and their were pictures of Meredith and candles on the cathedral steps.'

Meredith had arrived in Perugia in September 2007 to study Italian as part of her University of Leeds course and she had shared a house with Knox and two other women.

She was found semi naked and with her throat cut in her bedroom. Knox and Sollecito were arrested and charged - at their first trial they were convicted and sentenced to 26 and 25 years respectively.

Then two years later in 2011 they were cleared and Knox, 25, immediately flew home to Seattle where she has recently published a book about her experiences and for which she was paid $4 million.

Sollecito has moved from his home near Bari in southern Italy to Switzerland where he has set up an Internet firm after obtaining a degree in computer studies and both had always denied any involvement in the murder.

Perugia city council set up the scholarship thee years ago to honour Meredith and the first winner London student Olivia Taylor received the award at a ceremony at the town hall.

Mayor Wladimiro Boccali said: 'We setup the scholarship because we felt that the true protagonist and the real victim of this tragic event had been forgotten.

'The city of Perugia will never forget Meredith, in fact we want to honour her as she will always be associated with Perugia and for this reason she should have a place in our memory.

'So to honour her that's why we have set up this scholarship aimed at students as Meredith was in Perugia studying and it is also our way of strengthening ties with Meredith's family.

'That event changed our lives and its a wound that we will always carry in our hearts but at the same time Meredith will always have a place in the hearts of Perugians. She was our guest and we feel a sense of impotency for not defending her.'

Britain's ambassador in Rome, Christopher Prentice, said: 'The Kercher family, Meredith’s friends, and those whose lives Meredith touched have no need of an occasion in order to remember her. 

'She will be with them always.  But the generous creation of a scholarship in her name by the authorities in Perugia will enable other young British women to study in and appreciate Perugia, a city Meredith loved, and to get to know the hospitality of Italy, a country which Meredith so enjoyed visiting.'

Olivia, 19, from London, a first year Edinburgh University student studying Italian and Spanish, said: 'I was only 13 at the time of the murder but I remember it very well. Meredith was only a few years older than me when she died. The details were shocking.

'I was a bit apprehensive at first but I'm in a safe part of the city and it is so beautiful here. This is a fantastic opportunity and I'm looking forward to it. I met Stephanie and she was very supportive and very glad to be back for a more happier event.'

The two month scholarship will cover fees and accommodation costs for Olivia and will be awarded yearly though applications to the Italian Embassy in London. 

Drifter Rudy Guede is currently serving a 16 year sentence for the murder and sexual assault of Meredith.
