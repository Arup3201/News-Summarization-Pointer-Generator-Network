Queens Park Rangers caretaker manager Chris Ramsey would be delighted if the club were to appoint Tim Sherwood as Harry Redknapp's replacement.

Redknapp quit the Barclays Premier League's second-bottom side earlier this week citing problems with his knees, and Sherwood has been touted as his successor with an appointment expected next week.

The squad were put through their paces on Friday morning as Ramsey and director of football Les Ferdinand took training ahead of Saturday's Premier League clash with high-flying Southampton.

Former striker Ferdinand was appointed to his new role earlier this week but took a hands-on approach with the coaching staff at the session. 

Ramsey, who takes charge of Saturday's game  alongside Kevin Bond, worked under Sherwood at Tottenham last season – and says he would welcome the 46-year-old's expected arrival at Loftus Road. 

'We're good friends outside football,' said Ramsey, who admitted he had spoken to Sherwood since Redknapp's sudden departure. 'He gave me an opportunity last year along with Tottenham to coach in the Premier League so yeah, I'd be well happy working with him and I think he's very good at what he does.'

QPR's 3-1 loss to Stoke City last Saturday proved to be Harry Redknapp's last game at the helm

Comparing the situation at QPR to his time with Sherwood at Tottenham, Ramsey said: 'This is a slightly different challenge but at the end of the day it's still about getting players to buy into what the clubs trying to achieve.

'The players really need to step up now and achieve what they are capable of. For anyone that comes in it would be a fantastic job.'

Ramsey said earlier this week that the squad would be issued with a 'clean slate' under his temporary management – and that seems to include Adel Taarabt, who made just two starts this season under Redknapp.

'Most of the players are fit and almost everybody will be available,' Ramsey said.
