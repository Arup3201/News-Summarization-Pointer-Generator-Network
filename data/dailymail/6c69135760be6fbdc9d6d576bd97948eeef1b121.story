A woman who threw a syringe at a man accused of helping dupe women into paying for toxic injections to enhance their behinds on a talk show set has been charged with simple battery.

Brunetta Brown, 50, was in the audience of Telemundo's Pa'lante con Cristina show, filmed on January 25 at Dural Studio in Miami, Florida.

She was joined by her daughter, Shaquanda Brown, 30, an alleged victim of Corey Eubank and Oneal Ron Morris, accused of injecting women with a toxic mixture of tyre sealant, cement and super glue.

Eubank was on the show trying to clear his name. He was on stage with 
members of his legal team and Shaquanda Brown, who claims Morris's
 injections left her disfigured.

Discussions became heated
 when Brown's mother, who was seated in the front row, grabbed
 a syringe from a table and lunged at Eubank.

'The victim’s family jumped out of the 
front row and the victim jumped out and started attacking my client,' 
Eubank's lawyer Jim Lewis told the Miami Herald.

The syringe, which was to be used for a
 demonstration later in the talk show, scratched Eubank on the 
forehead.

Security officers restrained the woman following the attack and she was later arrested. Police interviewed 
show employees, guests and witnesses in the audience and viewed video of
 the show.

It is the latest drama in the case, which has received nationwide attention for the 'fake doctor' at its centre.

Speaking with CBS Miami after the attack, Eubank added: 'The
 mother jumped out of the audience, came and grabbed a syringe and threw
 it and it hit me in my forehead. I wanted to scream as loud as I could.'

Eubank, 40, of Hollywood, is 
accused of assisting Oneal Ron Morris, who police say tricked women into
 paying for injections which left their bodies horribly disfigured.

Morris, also known as 'Duchess', performed the procedures, while Eubank coordinated the appointments, police said.

The toxic injections left several alleged patients hospitalised and in need of corrective surgery.

But the duo have claimed they are innocent and they remain out on bail.

Morris, 30, was born a
 man but now lives as a woman. Her police photographs show an apparently
 enhanced rear, which police say is her own work.

The FBI has joined the investigation into the death of a British teenager who died after a botched 'booty boost' operation in a hotel room near Philadelphia Airport.

Claudia Aderotimi, an 18-year-old wannabe rap star from London, died after the 'backstreet' operation carried out by a transgender woman known as the Black Madam almost a year ago. She had hoped a curvier rear would boost her showbiz career.

It was thought Aderotimi had been injected with industrial grade silicone which caused her to have a massive heart attack only hours after the op. But coroner tests have failed to establish the type of substance used.

Forensic experts with the FBI crime lab are now trying to find out what kind of substance killed Aderotimi. They have taken over investigation into the case as part of a wider inquiry into illegal cosmetic surgery procedures.

Despite being charged with practicing
 healthcare without a licence and causing serious bodily injury, she has
 denied all allegations, saying the accusers are 'ruining her life'.

Morris claimed in an interview on Entertainment Tonight: 'They didn’t catch me doing anything. So they 
are just allegations. So I’m innocent. I really am innocent or 
whatever.

'I didn’t do any of 
these things to these people. Just know these people who are lying are 
ruining my life. That’s all I have to say.'

Morris
 was initially arrested November 18 after an alleged patient complained 
that she injected cement and a chemical compound called Fix-a-Flat, 
which is used to mend car tyres, into her backside.

The alleged victim was hospitalised 
with pneumonia and a bacterial infection after receiving a lethal 
cocktail of injections from Morris in May 2010.

She was left with life-threatening injuries, needing several surgeries and round-the-clock care.

But Florida health investigators took more than a year to gather evidence against Morris because the woman was too embarrassed to come forward.

Dangerous: The cocktail injected into the woman's buttocks included cement, tyre sealant and super glue

'Victim': Raji Narinesingh's face has been left misshapen by the illegal treatment

Morris was allowed out on bail then 
arrested again on November 23 when a second alleged victim came forward.
 Eubank, 40 was 
arrested the same day.

Morris performed her operations in homes and hotel rooms across South Florida, police say.

Another
 alleged victim, Raji Narinesingh, wanted fuller lips, cheeks and chin, but
 could not afford an operation by a licensed plastic surgeon, using 
medical silicone.

Narinesingh, who is also a transgender who lives as a woman, says she heard about the 'fake doctor' by word of mouth through the transgender community.

After
 being injected with a cocktail of toxins she allegedly left with lumpen
 shapes in her cheeks, a misshapen chin and a ballooning upper lip. She 
later had to pay a real surgeon to repair the botched job.

'I have learned my lesson,' She said. 'I could have died. I know that now.'

But Morris denied that she is a fake doctor. 'If anybody’s the victim, it’s definitely me,' she said.
