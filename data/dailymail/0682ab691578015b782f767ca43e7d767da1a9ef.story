A mother-of-three is facing 60 years prison in Wisconsin for allegedly orchestrating a murder-for-hire plot to kill her fiance, offering a former classmate $1,000 plus sexual favors to carry out the crime.

Jessica Strom, 33, allegedly spent two years plotting the death of her partner, lawyer John Schellpfeffer, asking a man she previously took criminal justice classes with at Northcentral Technical College to make the hit because 'he was very neat and thorough'.

However the man, a licensed pilot, became a police informant and secretly recorded a conversation he had with Strom, as part of a sting that allowed investigators to charge her with conspiracy to commit first-degree homicide.

The informant told police that the plot started when Strom asked him to meet in person and discuss a 'business proposal', according to police documents obtained by The Smoking Gun.

Jessica Strom is facing 60 years in prison for a charge conspiracy to commit first-degree homicide, after allegedly trying to hire a man to murder her husband

They got together at a cafe in downtown Wausau and Strom asked: 'Would you ever kill anybody?'

When the pilot said no, Strom asked what it would take.

Strom told the pilot that she had been 
planning to kill Schellpfeffer for two years, claiming he was 
'controlling' and had 'done bad things to her and others'.

'You’re very thorough and you’re very neat and I think you would be a good person to do this for me,' she allegedly said.

When the man remarked that she was in control and could 'just get out of the relationship if she wanted to', Strom replied 'that wouldn’t give her any satisfaction', investigators reported.

The Wisconsin Rapids Tribune reported that Strom assured the informant the job would be easy.

She said he could make a fake appointment at Schellpfeffer's office wanting advice on an adoption and even drew a diagram of the office, noting the working habits of Schellpfeffer's colleagues.

She said the informant could walk in, 'blow his brains out and walk out'.

She also told him to buy a gun 'off the street'.

Strom allegedly said she would do it herself but it would be too obvious.

Though he had initially asked for $50,000 to kill Schellpfeffer, the informant told Strom that he would settle for $1,000.

Strom is said to have replied 'and some sex'.

At some point after the killing, Strom told the informant that she would meet up with him and 'pay you and f--- you and whatever'.

But she warned: 'Don’t tell anyone about this. I don’t want to have to kill you too.'

The man subsequently contacted the police and agreed to record a meeting with Strom.

Strom’s home was raided by police after the sting operation and she was arrested for conspiracy to commit first degree murder, which carries a maximum 60-year prison term.

Strom told police she was not serious about having Schellpfeffer killed, and had intended to contact the pilot the following day to call off the murder.

She is being held at Marathon County Jail in Wausau, Wisconsin on a $250,000 cash bond. 

She briefly appeared in court today, WSAW reported.

Strom is scheduled for a March 12 preliminary hearing.
