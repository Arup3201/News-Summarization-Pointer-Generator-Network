Susanna Reid will be holidaying in the UK for the next fortnight after being caught in passport backlog

Breakfast presenter Susanna Reid’s plans for a family holiday abroad have been halted after she was caught up in the passport backlog and forced to take a ‘staycation’.

The Good Morning Britain host had been putting off filling out the application for one of her sons after reporting on the issues at the Home Office on the show.

Ms Reid, 43, was due to jet off today but despite posting the form on July 9, she is still without a passport and is now opting for a holiday in the UK with sons Sam, Finn and Jack.

The process typically takes three weeks but the under-staffed department has struggled to deal with the surge in applications and some travellers have faced a two-month wait.

Her son’s document is now thought to be one of about 350,000 being processed by the Home Office.

The presenter told the Mirror that she reported on the backlog in June and was well aware of the problem, blaming herself for not posting the application in time.

‘We were inundated with comments by viewers – both those experiencing the backlog and others asking, ‘Who are these people that leave their passports till the last minute?’ Well, I’m one of them,’ she said.

‘So there I was reporting on the story and in the back of my mind thinking, ‘One of my boys needs his passport renewing’. For some reason, like other busy mums, I kept putting it off. I kept thinking, ‘It’s such a palaver’ – you need to get the photos done, the form and the counter-signature.’

The former BBC Breakfast star, who had booked the two weeks off work, admitted she still had hopes the family could travel abroad as late as today but now realises that won’t be a possibility. 

The family did not want to risk the disappointment and so had not booked a holiday beforehand.

Ms Reid is now hoping to make the most of the British weather and take a ‘staycation’, although she has not revealed where in the UK she will be holidaying.

She said: ‘We’ve been so lucky with the weather. There couldn’t have been a better time to get it wrong.’

Emergency measures were brought in to deal with an ‘exceptional period of demand’ in passports after thousands encountered longer than expected delays.

This included increased staffing and free of charge fast-tracking applications of people with an urgent need to travel abroad.

HM Passport Office chief executive Paul Pugh said that the 775,000 applications received in June 'I think is the highest ever recorded in a single month'.

But the Home Office announced last Sunday that the number of passports being processed in the week ending June 22 was down to 360,000.

The Home Secretary, Theresa May, has apologised to those affected by the backlog.

Applications for passports surged unexpectedly this year and the Passport Office says it has been dealing with its highest demand in 12 years.

The under-staffed department was under pressure to deal with over half a million applications from people hopeful to go on holiday this summer.

Thousands upgraded to the £128 premium fast-track four-hour service, fearing their passports would not arrive in time.

Extra staff were drafted in, with some working seven days a week to clear the backlog of 30,000 passports, and raking in almost £1million in overtime pay.

Standard passports cost £72.50 - or £46 for children - and should only take three weeks to get, but some holidaymakers reported waiting two months to get their documents back.

David Cameron blamed the application surge on the fact the economy has picked and more people have planned foreign holidays.

The Home Office said last Sunday that the number of passports being processed was 360,000, which was down from its peak of 508,000 in the week ending June 22.

More than four million passports have been issued so far in 2014.
