Ed Miliband’s party conference risks being derailed by claims he has a £27billion blackhole in his spending plans.

Analysis by Treasury officials suggests a raft of Labour promises would require more than £1,000 extra borrowing per household in 2015.

In a further sign of confusion in Labour promises, Mr Miliband today refused to guarantee he would increase the minimum wage despite complaining that it has fallen as the cost of living soared.

Questions: Labour leader Ed Miliband was forced to deny making spending commitments worth £27billion

The Labour faces increased pressure with a new poll showing just 20 per cent of people think he has the right policies for the economy, just half of the 38 per cent who back the Tories.

He used the start of the party conference in Brighton to declare that he was ‘bringing socialism back’ to Britain.

He unveiled a raft of promises including more 8am-6pm childcare at schools, monitoring the number of women on TV and forcing firms who hire foreign workers to also take on British apprentices.

But he was forced to deny committing to billions of pounds of promises without saying how they would be paid for.

Borrowing: The Tories produced this list of policies which Labour has committed to

The Tories produced a document dubbed a Budget for Borrowing, which points to pledges including cutting VAT to 17.5 per cent, at a cost of £12.75billion, scrapping the one per cent cap on benefits rises worth £2.68billion and introducing a 10p starting rate of tax at a cost of £2billion.

By contrast Labour has promised to raise only £105million from scrapping the winter fuel allowance for pensioners on the top rate of tax and reversing stamp duty changes to raise £145million.

Today Mr Miliband dismissed the claim that there is a £27.9 billion black hole in his party's spending plans as ‘nonsense’.

He insisted Labour would not increase borrowing to fund day to day spending in its first year of power if the party wins the next election.

He told BBC 1's Andrew Marr Show: ‘Let me be clear, we have said in 2015/16 that Labour won't be borrowing more for day to day spending.

‘We have been absolutely clear about that. The next Labour government will be facing different circumstances from the last.

‘Ed Balls and I have both said times are going to be tough and frankly I think Treasury ministers should be worrying about the cost of living crisis facing families and not making up things about the Labour party.’

The Tories compiled the figures after anaylsying speeches, articles and interviews given by Labour frontbenchers since Mr Miliband became leader, and added up what their pledges would cost.

Conservative treasury minister Savid Javid said the £27.9 billion of unfunded policies in 2015-16 was the equivalent of £1,059 additional borrowing for every household.

Issues: When asked which party has the best policies on the economy, 38 per cent said the Conservatives compared to just 20 per cent who said Labour

Mr Javid added: ‘In the three months since Ed Miliband promised ‘discipline’ on borrowing, Labour have committed themselves to £27.9 billion of debt-funded spending – more than £1,000 of additional borrowing for every household.

‘This shows that Ed Miliband is too weak to deliver on his promises. Nothing has changed.

‘It’s the same old Labour. They still want more spending, more borrowing and more debt – exactly what got us into a mess in the first place.

‘And it’s hardworking people who would pay the price through higher taxes and higher mortgage rates.’

Clash: BBC interviewer Andrew Marr repeatedly pressed Mr Miliband on whether he would increase the minimum wage

Mr Miliband repeatedly insisted he would take action to help families cope with rising cost of living.

He said Labour would 'crack down' on companies that failed to pay workers the minimum wage and would look at 'strengthening' a higher minimum wage in certain sectors, such as finance.

Labour 
claims the £6.19 rate for adults is now 45p lower than if it had kept 
pace with the rate of inflation. If increased to restore its value, 
someone working 37 hours-a-week would by £865 better off, before tax.

But asked if the minimum wage should increase, Mr Miliband repeatedly refused commit to a rise.

'The minimum wage must be set at a level where it is not going to cost jobs, that's really important and so that's what we have got to look at,' he said.

Asked if the basic minimum wage would go up, he told Andrew Marr: 'That's something we are going to look at.

'I want to see the minimum wage go up over time but if I was coming on this programme and saying I'm just going to pluck out of the air a figure of how much the minimum wage will go up by, you would say "is that really responsible?".'

Mr Miliband also said large firms will have to train up a British apprentice for every overseas worker they bring to the UK while he would ensure apprenticeships in Britain are 'gold standard'.

He believes the policy could result in the creation of 125,000 new apprentices over five years because the long-term solution for the UK economy is to develop a highly skilled homegrown workforce.
