A beloved surgeon who was targeted and fatally shot by gunman at a Boston hospital on Tuesday was expecting his fourth child with his wife, who is seven months pregnant, it has emerged.

Cardiovascular surgeon Dr. Michael Davidson, 44, from Wellesley, Massachusetts, was shot by Stephen Pasceri, 55, on Tuesday morning and passed away late that evening. Pasceri's relatives suggested that he was angry over the death of his mother, whom Dr Davidson had treated.

Davidson leaves behind his wife, who is a plastic surgeon, and their three other children, two girls aged seven and nine and a two-year-old son, his father-in-law told the Boston Herald.

Four of Davidson's colleagues paid tribute to him during a news conference at the hospital, and remembered him as 'almost always the smartest man in the room'.

'You all should be absolutely assured that Michael Davidson was one of the kindest, best possible men that ever walked on this earth,' colleague Dr. Andrew Eisenhauer said, ABC News reported. 'We knew that and his patients knew that and his family knows that.'

His colleagues also recalled his 'silly side' and how he played guitar in a band with other doctors from the hospital.  

The gunman, an accountant and married father-of-four, had walked into the heart center and asked for Dr Davidson, before shooting him twice and taking his own life in a separate room. 

On Wednesday, Dr Davidson's heartbroken father-in-law told the Herald how Dr Davidson had yelled for patients and staff to flee before he was shot.

'He was a hero - he told everybody to get out,' he said. 'He started yelling, "Get out. Get out." He knew it was coming.'

He recalled how much he cared for his patients, and added: 'He loved his family. He loved his kids. He loved my daughter to death.'

A fund has been set up for the family here.

Pasceri's family have said they can't understand why he snapped, but they believe he could have been wanting to enact revenge on Dr. Davidson after his mother, Marguerite, died in November.

Dr. Davidson had treated Marguerite Pasceri for a cardiovascular condition during her stay at Brigham and Women's last year. She died on November 15, 2014.

Pasceri, who was licensed to carry a firearm, may have also been holding a vendetta because of the health care his father Greg received during a fatal hear attack in December 2011.

The Worcester Telegram reported that in 2012, Pasceri became so furious that his mother had been left with a $8,000 medical bill, he wrote to Senator John Kerry and US Rep. James McGovern to demand an investigation.

However, the newspaper noted that the Pasceri family had no issue with the level of care received by their father at Massachusetts General Hospital.

Pasceri's sister said she was stunned that her brother had attacked the doctor. 

Blame game: Marguerite E. (Olofson) Pasceri passed away on November 15, 2014 and it is thought that her son and executor, Stephen Pasceri blamed Dr. Davidson at Brigham and Women's Hospital for her passing

Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh said he was 'deeply saddened' by Davidson's death. 'This tragedy is the result of a senseless act of violence that has no place in our City,' he said in a statement early Wednesday

'Everything seemed to be going really well. I have no idea why he snapped like this,' said Marguerite Jolym, according to the Boston Herald.

According to Joly, her brother 'deeply loved' his mother and said her 'warm, compassionate, generous and understanding personality was a gift and example to the world'. 

'I think it comes down to the fact that my brother thought it was the doctor's fault that my mother died,' Joly said. 'I don't know why my brother would blame him. I really don't know why.'

According to the Boston Herald, Pasceri worked as an accountant for Waters Corp, which is based in Milford.

Marguerite Joly said her brother served in the military for a time and was honorably discharged and was a married father of four. 

'We can't even wrap our brains around this,' she said. 'There was no indication whatsoever that he would ever do anything like this... All his ducks were in a row,' she said. 'This was not a bad, evil man. Something happened, and I don't know what.'

In the aftermath of Dr. Davidson's death, staff at Brigham and women's entered into a period of mourning according to NECN. 

Hospital officials said Wednesday they planned to lower a flag outside the hospital to half-staff in honor of Davidson. 

'Dr. Davidson was a wonderful and inspiring cardiac surgeon who devoted his career to saving lives and improving the quality of life of every patient he cared for,' said a statement issued by the hospital, which is affiliated with Harvard Medical School. 

'It is truly devastating that his own life was taken in this horrible manner.'  

Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh said he was 'deeply saddened' by Davidson's death.

'This tragedy is the result of a senseless act of violence that has no place in our City,' he said in a statement early Wednesday.

Evans said earlier Tuesday that police were talking to witnesses, 'but it's leading us to believe there was something in the past that upset this guy, that made him go in and look for this particular doctor'.

After shooting the surgeon, he went into another room and shot himself. 

Boston Police Commissioner William Evans said officers conducting a room-by-room search found the gunman dead in an exam room with the weapon.

Police said Pasceri wasn't a patient of the doctor's and they didn't specify a motive for the shootings.   

Shortly after the shooting, one witness said that the Shapiro building had been placed on lockdown and dozens of emergency vehicles had arrived on the scene.

'Once we were clear of the waiting room, there were police officers with their weapons drawn yelling, 'Get down! Get down,'' said one man to WCVB.

Hospital employees are well-drilled for the nightmare scenario of a shooter inside the building.

In November 2013, doctors and nurses and other staff at the world-famous institution underwent training for an active shooter situation and viewed a video for a so-called 'Code Silver' event.

'I am extremely proud of the way our staff responded,' said hospital president Dr. Elizabeth Nabel according to the Boston Globe.  

Boston police had at one stage mistakenly tweeted that Pasceri had been apprehended and was in custody.  

Boston Police Commissioner William Evans said that because the doctor was surrounded by colleagues medical help was administered immediately.

'We are looking at a possible motive. We know (the gunman) came into the hospital on the second floor looking for this particular doctor. There was a reason he targeted this doctor,' Evans said according to WMUR.Com.

'Our prayers go out to the doctor's wife,' Evans said.
