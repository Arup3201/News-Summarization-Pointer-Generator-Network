A thick blanket of heavy fog has created travel chaos for people heading into Melbourne Airport.

Visibility has been reduced to about 150 metres at the airport and across the city.

Photos of the city show its skyscrapers barely visible and the wings of planes just poking through the fog at the airport.

The current batch of fog has been hanging around since Wednesday but bouts of it have been causing trouble for the past couple of weeks.

Melbourne Airport spokeswoman Anna Gillett said the fog had forced some international flights to divert to other cities and some incoming domestic flights had been delayed but, at this stage, departures were not badly affected.

'We're advising people to jump on to their airline's website and check for updates to their schedules but at this stage come to the airport as normal,' Ms Gillett said.

Bureau of Meteorology senior forecaster Terry Ryan said the fog should begin to lift later on Friday morning.

Bemused: 'Melbourne covered in fog for the third morning in a row, starting to feel like Gotham City,' Kieran Jones said on Twitter on Friday

'It should begin to lift at the airport around 10-ish but generally it will take a while to clear from the city area and the suburbs because it takes a while for the sun to heat things up,' he said.

The fog should clear Melbourne by lunchtime, he said.

Mr Ryan said a slow moving weather pattern with a high pressure ridge over Victoria and light winds had caused this week's foggy conditions.

'It's a very unusual weather pattern for this time of year,' he said.

'A pattern like this is normally associated with autumn.'

Melbourne is expecting a sunny top of 18C on Friday, with sunshine and temperatures into the low 20C range over the weekend ahead of showers and a cooler change on Monday.
