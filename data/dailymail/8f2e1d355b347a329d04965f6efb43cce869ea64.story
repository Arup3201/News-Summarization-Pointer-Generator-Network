A wealthy businessman is being sued by his former secretary who claims she was forced to view e-mails containing pornographic photographs of strangers and even naked pictures of the man’s wife.

The $4 million legal action has been filed against Bill Berkman, a managing partner in the private equity firm Associated Partners, by his former executive assistant Nancy Woods.

According to the lawsuit filed in Manhattan’s Federal District Court she claims her job forced her ‘to review offensive, lewd e-mails and attachments which subjects were naked or scantily clad women’.

She claims Berkman emailed these photos to his friend Gerald Cardinale, the former head of Goldman Sachs’ private-equity business, who in 2007 helped Alex Rodriguez negotiate a new $275 million contract with the New York Yankees.

According to Wood's suit, e-mails between Berkman and Cardinale included ‘inappropriate pictures of random and unsuspecting women on the street from a favorite bench shared by Berkman and Cardinale, from the subway and from the East Hampton seaplane.’

The New York Post reports that photos in the lawsuit appear to been taken without the women’s knowledge and included young women in short skirts in Soho.

One e-mail sent from Berkman to Cardinale allegedly included an image of wife Ronit Golan Berkman’s bottom along with the text, ‘Ronit in a bikini from our trip in Cabo.’

In her $4 million lawsuit, former executive assistant Nancy Woods, above, claims she was forced her 'to review offensive, lewd e-mails and attachments which subjects were naked or scantily clad women'

Cardinale is alleged to have sent Berkman an email containing a nude photo of actress Lake Bell and a message that read, 'You need to take photos of Ronit in these poses... tonite!!'

The lawsuit also claims that Berkman 'regularly sends pornographic material he maintains at Wickr, Top Secret Messenger.'

Mail Online has reached out to Berkman for comment on the lawsuit.

An attorney for Berkman told the Post: ‘Ms. Woods has worked for the company for six years. She was aware her employment was about to be terminated, and we believe she filed this lawsuit to retaliate against and embarrass her employer.

‘The referenced e-mails were personal ones between friends, which Ms. Woods should not have reviewed. Her claims are without merit and will be vigorously defended against.’

Associated Partners' managers, brothers David and Bill Berkman, are the scions of a Pittsburgh family that made a fortune in communications.

The family business started selling greeting cards and went on to own radio and TV stations and eventually operate and sell off early cellular networks.
