A fancy-dress reveller was killed in a hit-and-run accident when the driver failed to see him in his 'Rambo' camouflage costume.

Ian Hamilton, 27, had camouflage paint on his face and arms and was wearing combat trousers, a black T-shirt and black boots when he was knocked down by a car going at twice the speed limit.

Driver Jamie Gray, 23, who has been jailed for four years and eight months, claimed he didn’t spot Mr Hamilton in the road in the village of Pontllanfraith, near Caerphilly, South Wales, at 3am as he drove a borrowed BMW.

A court heard that Mr Hamilton, who was a fan of Sylvester Stallone's action hero Rambo, always wore his jungle camouflage kit to fancy-dress events.

He had just left a family birthday party and was walking along a road when he was hit. And instead of getting medical help Gray drove off leaving his Rambo-costumed victim for dead in the road.

The court heard Gray, who was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving, was doing an estimated 67mph in a 30mph zone.

Mr Hamilton was found dead by a passing motorist and a search was launched for the driver.

Prosecutor Lucy Crowther said: 'Mr Hamilton went to a family party dressed as Rambo which was what he would always wear at fancy-dress events.

'He was dressed in camouflage trousers, black vest and boots with camouflage paint on his face and arms.

'In the early hours of the morning he was seen stumbling along a road smiling to himself in his Rambo outfit.'

Ian Hamilton was a huge fan of Rambo and would always go to fancy dress parties as the Sylvester Stallone character

A passer-by heard the car hit Mr Hamilton and drive away at speed, but didn’t realise it was a fatal crash until reading police appeals the next day.

Police launched a major hunt for the hit-and-run driver after the tragedy.

Gray was caught after police found a tiny piece of black plastic from the silver BMW 3-series on the road and traced all 150 similar models in South Wales.

They visited 50 owners before they found the car which killed Mr Hamilton, of Bristol.

Cardiff Crown Court heard Gray was driving at 'terrifying' speeds of up to 67mph in a 30mph residential area when he hit the camouflaged pedestrian.

John Ryan, defending, said: 'This was not a standard pedestrian who was easily visible.

'Mr Gray panicked and fled - he is deeply sorry for his actions and has been left mentally scarred.'

Gray, of Cross Keys, near Newport, admitted causing death by dangerous driving, driving without insurance, driving without a licence, failing to stop after an accident and failing to report an accident.

The court heard his licence had been revoked after convictions for speeding and other motoring offences.

He was jailed after the court heard he was on bail for alleged drink-driving at the time of the collision in July this year.

Recorder of Cardiff Judge Nicholas Cooke told him: 'You struck the head of another human being while driving very fast - you failed to stop and effectively left him for dead.

'What was more important for you was the chance of evading detection. That is shameful.'

Gray will be banned from driving for four years when he is released from prison.

After the case, Mr Hamilton’s family paid tribute to a much-loved young man who dreamed of joining the army.

His brother Clyne said: 'He was kind, caring, thoughtful, cheeky and charming.

'He was a person with a bright future in front of him with his own family and that chance was taken away from him.

'If Jamie Gray had not been doing such a reckless speed we would not be here - that is why we could never forgive him.'
