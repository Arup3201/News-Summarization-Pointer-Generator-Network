A 14-year-old boy has accused police of over-reacting after they pinned him to the ground and choked him for allegedly giving them 'dehumanising stares'.

Officers tackled unarmed Tremaine McMillian to the ground and pinned him there by his neck on Haulover Beach in Miami, Florida, in scenes captured on camera by his mother.

In interviews Tremaine said he was merely walking along the beach, feeding his puppy from a bottle, when police riding all-terrain vehicles swooped late on Monday morning.

Unnecessary roughness? Tremaine McMillian is pictured being restrained by a Miami-Dade Police officer on Haulover beach, after allegedly threatening them with 'dehumanising stares' and clenched fists

But Miami-Dade police have claimed they were forced to restrain the youngster after he refused to follow orders, clenched his fists and gave them 'dehumanising stares'.

Their version of the story has led to the boy being charged with resisting arrest with violence.

Maurissa Holmes, Tremaine's mother, captured video on her mobile phone that shows a burly police officer with his arm wrapped tightly around the neck of the slender teenager while another binds him with handcuffs.

'He started choking me, and as he was choking me, I urinated on myself because I couldn't breathe,' said Tremaine in an interview broadcast on WSVN News.

Ms Holmes told CBS Miami: 'I ran over with my son and used my cell phone when I saw my son and he couldn’t breathe.

'There was no reason to slam him on the ground like that the way they did. He’s a child, not an adult. For them to jump off their ATV and do this, this is wrong. I want justice. You don’t do that to a child.'

Tremaine's family say that just before the police moved in he had been playing in the surf with friends. He said he was holding his six-week-old puppy when officers came up and demanded to know what he was doing.

Miami-Dade Police say they approached Tremaine because they saw him roughhousing with another teenager, although they admitted that as they approached officers realised there was not sort of fight going on.

Nevertheless, officers went on to demand that Tremaine stop what he was doing and account for himself.

'I asked, why, and he told me, because he said so, and I asked why again,' Tremaine told WSVN. 'That's when he told me, "Show me where your mom's at".'

He said he was following the orders and leading them to his mother when police leapt from their vehicle, slapped the puppy from his hand, grabbed him and slammed him to the ground.

He says his puppy, Marco, was injured in the attack and in television interviews the animal can be seen wincing as he touches its paw.

Tremaine pictured with his mother Maurissa Holmes: Police tell a different story which claims that the 14-year-old was uncooperative and became combative and clenched his fists as police attempted to detain him

Police tell a different story. Miami-Dade Police Detective Alvaro Zabaleta said it was just after 11am when officers apparently saw Tremaine body slamming another teenager onto the sand.

Police reports say they then realised that no fight was going on, but Detective Zabaleta told CBS Miami that Tremaine refused to take officers to his parents and they were forced to leave their ATV to detain him as he started to leave the beach area.

According to the police report, Tremaine became combative and clenched his fist as police went to hold him. 'He attempted to pull his arm away, stating, "Man, don't touch me like I did something,"' the report ways.

Detective Zabaleta said Tremaine's actions indicated he was 'resisting officers' and meant he had to be taken into custody.

'Of course we have to neutralize the threat,' said the detective. 'When you have somebody resistant to them and pulling away and somebody clenching their fists and flailing their arms, that’s a threat.'

Tremaine has been charged with resisting arrest with violence and disorderly conduct. He is being represented by a public defender and has entered a plea of not guilty.

His trial is slated to start on July 16.
