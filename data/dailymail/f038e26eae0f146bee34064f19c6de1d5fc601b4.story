Her cast mates included Nora Dunn, Jon Lovitz, Dennis Miller, A. Whitney Brown and Kevin Nealon.

'If you're talented, if you're good, you'll get work,' she told the Orlando Sentinel in 1994 of the male-dominated 'SNL' cast.

'It's a waste of energy to complain you're not getting this or that because you're a woman. On "SNL," I found that the more you complained, the more you pigeon-holed yourself.' 

Hooks was born in Decatur, Georgia, and grew up in Atlanta. 

Her family moved to Florida during her high school years, when she began acting in her school's theater productions.

She continued to act when she began attending the University of West Florida, where she was active in local summer theater productions. 

'I was an Indian princess in an outdoor drama in Livingston, Texas,'; she told the Associated Press in 1991. 'I got $115 a week. I couldn't believe it.” 

Hooks' big break came in 1985, with a role in 'Pee-wee’s Big Adventure.'
