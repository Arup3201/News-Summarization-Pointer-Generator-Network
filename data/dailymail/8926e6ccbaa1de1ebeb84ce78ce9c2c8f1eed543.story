Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani may have come under fire for saying that President Barack Obama does not love America, but he has at least one 12-year-old backer in Georgia. 

Middle school student CJ Pearson made a YouTube video in which he said that the commander in chief had a 'downright hate for the American values our country holds'.

The video, posted Saturday on his channel, has garnered more than 112,000 views as of Sunday night. 

CJ Pearson, a 12-year-old from Georgia, posted a video backing former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani's comments criticizing President Obama's 

The middle schooler said the president is 'not willing to defend our country against the evil of terrorism domestic and abroad'

A 'public figure' page for the student says he has 'considered himself a conservative since the mere age of 8, supporting John McCain in his 2008 Presidential Campaign'. 

He said in his video that if Obama really loved America he would call Islamic State 'what it really is, an assault on Christianity' 

The student added that the president, who has ordered airstrikes on ISIS and asked for approval to send limited ground troops, was 'not willing to defend our country against the evil of terrorism domestic and abroad'.

The student said that the president 'wouldn't try to take away what hard working Americans have worked for their entire lives' and 'wouldn't take away the rights of the American people'. 

Giuliani has said that he stands by his comments made last week.

However, he wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal saying that he 'didn’t intend to question President Obama’s motives or the content of his heart'. 

Giuliani wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal saying that he didn't want to question Obama's motives or heart 

He said it was weak, however, to show 'any reluctance to hold up America and its ideals in contrast to the nation’s enemies'.

The former mayor also criticized Obama's comments about torture and American exceptionalism.

Republicans such  Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who sat next to the former mayor when he made the comments, have been asked to follow up on the original remarks.

The possible presidential candidate said he didn't know if Obama loved his country or if he was Christian, despite the president repeatedly talking about his faith.

Other conservative figures have tried to distance themselves from Giuliani. 

Indiana Governor Mike Pence, another potential candidate for a 2016 White House run, said 'I don't think it helps to question the president's patriotism' on Fox News Sunday.

The Midwestern governor criticized Obama for being 'fully willing to lecture the people of this country about the crusades, but is unwilling to call Islamic extremism for what it is'.

Indiana Governor Mike Pence said that questioning the patriotism of Obama (pictured at the 2015 Governors Dinner) was not helpful
