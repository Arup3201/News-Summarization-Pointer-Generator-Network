Paul Whiteley of West Yorkshire Police is pictured leaving Scarborough Magistrates Court after being found guilty of the assault

A shamed murder squad detective who tore off his shirt before drunkenly attacking a holidaymaker while boasting 'I'm a copper, I will do what I like', has been sacked.

Award-winning police officer Detective Sergeant Paul Whiteley also hurled shocking abuse at the mum of an autistic girl, telling her 'f*** your f***ing disabled child'.

Whiteley who worked on the homicide and major enquiry team at West Yorkshire Police, had been suspended from his job since being charged with assault over the unprovoked incident, during which he brawled with a man in a pub.

The 41-year-old had been drinking in the Fylingdales Inn near Whitby, North Yorkshire for seven hours, sinking two and a half bottles of red wine with his partner, 43-year-old Claire Hughes. 

During his trial, Scarborough Magistrates Court heard that electrician Carl Sarsfield, 41, who was holidaying in the seaside resort, had been asked to have a word with the Whiteley and his partner when a barmaid spotted them heading for their car.

They were followed by Mr Sarsfield, of Oldham, Greater Mancester as they left, still carrying an open bottle of wine.

Mr Sarsfield told the court: 'I went out there and asked him politely 'You are not drinking and driving are you?'

He claimed Whiteley, who was getting in the passenger side, replied; 'I'm not driving - she is.'

The electrician said he objected, saying: 'She is legless as well.'

The court heard that Mr Sarsfield then rejoined his girlfriend Miss Crossley and her 19-year-old autistic daughter in the pub, while a taxi was ordered for the Whiteley and his partner.

But when Whiteley and his partner then came back into the pub, things became 'heated'.

Mr Sarsfield claimed the detective had attacked him, slapping him in the face. He then defended himself, with the police officer ending up on his back.

He said: 'He was absolutely legless. He could hardly stand up. He was falling all over the place.

'I could have burped on him and he would have fallen over.'

Giving evidence, Miss Crossley said: 'He ripped his shirt off after the slap and slung it towards the bar. He shouted at Carl - "Come on then - outside you bald headed b******.  I'm a copper - I will do what I like."

'He was paralytic. My initial reaction was to get my daughter away from what was going on. I told them to calm down and there was no need to behave in that way.' 

The award-winning detective, pictured with his Divisional Commander's Certificate of Commendation left, has now been sacked from his position after 22 years with West Yorkshire Police's murder squad

The full-time carer said her daughter had been 'hysterical' during the attack.

'I saw Carl and the man fighting,' she added. 'The man was very drunk and fell over.'

Police were called and Whiteley told the people in the pub: 'Let them come. I'm a police officer. I will sort it out,' the court heard.

Miss Crossley said as they waited for police to arrive Whiteley shouted abuse about her daughter.

She added: 'My daughter was absolutely beside herself. It affected her for weeks afterwards.'

Whiteley, of Wakefield, West Yorkshire was fined £550 and ordered to pay £850 in costs after being convicted of assault at his trial in July, and subsequently lost an appeal.

Now West Yorkshire Police has confirmed his position has been terminated.

Detective Chief Supt Clive Wain, of the forces professional standards department, said 'Following a recent conviction for assault, an officer was dismissed on Tuesday, December 2, without notice, for gross misconduct.

'West Yorkshire Police expects the highest standards of professionalism from all officers and staff and will take appropriate disciplinary action against anyone who fails to meet those standards.'

It is understood the force wanted to deny Whiteley the opportunity to resign following a number of cases in which disgraced officers have left voluntarily and then found jobs with other forces.

Ms Hughes was charged with assaulting Miss Crossley but she was found not guilty. 

The homicide and major enquiry detective worked on several major murders during his 22 years with the West Yorkshire Police. They include the case of brothers John and David Kinsella who killed their sister's boyfriend Ross Keenan, 39, in 2007.

Both brother were given life sentences with John told he must serve at least 21 years and David, known as Micky, a minimum of 15 years, for the brutal attack in which a meat cleaver and carving knife were used.
