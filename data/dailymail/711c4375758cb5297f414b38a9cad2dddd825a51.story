World Cup wining defender Mats Hummels has dealt Manchester United a blow in their attempt to sign him by insisting he is happy at Borussia Dortmund.

Louis van Gaal is thought to be interested in signing the centre back as he looks to patch up his leaky defence in the January transfer window.

But the Germany World Cup winner said although he saw the interest as a compliment, and accepted that he could earn more money with a move away from Dortmund, he has no intention of leaving the club.

'It's nice to hear that big clubs like that are interested in you,' Hummels told Bundesliga Magazine International. 'I take that as a compliment.

'But it doesn't influence me in any way, otherwise. We earn enough here in Dortmund.

'There will always be someone who can pay more than BVB. But Dortmund have made a lot of progress in my time here.

'In any case, I believe that's enough for me. If one day I start thinking about playing abroad, money won't be the reason.

'But I don't even think about that at the moment. We still have so much further to go here.'

The Germany defender says he owes his development to Dortmund and doesn't want to leave

Hummels played a big part in Germany's World Cup success, scoring against France in the quarter-finals

Hummels has been at Dortmund since 2008, winning the Bundesliga twice as well as helping Jurgen Klopp's side reach the Champions League final in 2013.

And the Germany defender insisted that the club's stature as one of the smaller outfits among Europe's elite makes the successes all the more satisfying.

'I've been here for six and a half years and it's simply more exciting and more difficult to win trophies as an underdog.

'Everybody can win things with 25 superstars in the squad. At BVB, every single player has more responsibility but also more opportunity.

'It's difficult to win trophies with Dortmund but it's always possible. And when it happens, the feeling is simply indescribable.'

Manchester United are hoping to sign the World Cup winning star but the player is happy where he is
