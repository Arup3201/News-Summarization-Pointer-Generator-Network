The fire which destroyed a three-storey five-bedroom £3.5m mansion in Caversham, home to multi-millionaire businessman Darren Browne

The fire started in a first floor bedroom of the house at around 2.30pm on Sunday afternoon and the damage at the property is expected to cost more than £1m to repair

The three-storey £3.5m mansion on the banks of the River Thames is home to millionaire businessman Darren Browne 

Mr Browne's son Conor, had been in the house with his girlfriend and teenage brother Paddy when they spotted the fire starting in a first floor bedroom of the house at around 2.30pm on Sunday afternoon.

The 23-year-old dialled 999 to raise the alarm and fled the detached house with the family dogs, Molly and Digger, before calling his father, who had been out shopping with his wife. 

The large house, which has wooden rafters and is called Caversham Grange, has been home to the family for the last eight years. 

Mr Browne said: 'Fortunately everyone is okay.

The fire ripped through the expensive property, leaving the roof significantly damaged and some of the rooms charred by the large fire 

Several rooms in the mansion were damaged by smoke from the blaze while part of the roof of the mansion caved in, littering roof tiles 

Darren Browne was born and raised in the Cotswolds. 

He went to  Burford School in Oxford.

Next he decided to go into business, and got his break when he helped launch gadget website www.boysstuff.co.uk. 

Mr Browne has 25 years experience working in recruitment - also serving as managing director of Hays Information Technology for 10 years and CEO of Servoca Plc, formally Dream Group for nine.

He is now chief executive and director of Pertemps, a recruitment agency specialising in permanent and temporary jobs.

Mr Browne also holds 20 directorships at companies specialising in recruitment.  

'There is substantial damage and significant water damage to the ground floor as well. It is uninhabitable.'

A total of six crews of firefighters spent almost 22 hours battling the blaze at the mansion which is on the banks of the River Thames in Reading, Berkshire.

Plumes of thick black smoke were seen from across the other side of the River Thames in Tilehurst in Reading. 

Neighbour Stuart Bartlett, who lives in nearby Grass Hill, spotted the smoke from his own house.

'There was a massive amount of flames going way up into the sky followed by an enormous amount of smoke,' he said.

'It went up very, very quickly. Within half-an-hour the whole thing was in flames,' he said.

'It is unbelievably sad. From the look of it there will be nothing to save. It is dreadful, the family must be heartbroken.'

The roof of the property caved in with dislodged tiles scattered across it, whilst the front windows were cracked or smashed in the heat. 

The first and second floors were heavily smoke damaged and debris from the house can be seen scattered around the garden.

Mr Browne, 47, a recruitment specialist, is a self styled entrepreneur and started his business with a gadget website. 

None of the family were harmed in the fire. Mr Browne's other son Josh, 24, and 22-year-old daughter Maddie were both away when it broke out, but the family's pet rabbit, Dougal was found dead.

The father-of-four added: 'We have scattered the children around to grandparents and friends but my wife and I need to find accommodation.

'It is very sad but we feel very lucky that we are all safe. If it had happened at night it could have been a different story.

'We were hoping it was just a small fire, but when we got back we could see the plumes of smoke.

'It is impossible to say how grateful we are to the fire brigade and our neighbours. They have been great.'

Mr Browne said he did not know how much the damage would cost and said he was forced to stay in a hotel on Sunday evening.  

A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said that a joint investigation with the Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service had been launched although the origin of the fire was not believed to have been suspicious.

Caversham Grange, home to Mr Browne and his family, is a large property on the banks of the River Thames and has five bathrooms 

Several possessions and items of furniture from the house were seen outside in the family garden, with clothes littering the trees 

Firefighters spent more than 22 hours battling the blaze to try and control it, and several rooms were left water logged after the incident 

Mr Browne said he was relieved no one was hurt but estimated that the damage done to his mansion could cost more than £1million to repair 

The father-of-four said he had hoped to arrive home to see just a small fire but was shocked to see it took hold of the top part of the house

Firefighters were called to the house on Sunday evening, and the only casualty was a rabbit belonging to the family as the dogs also escaped
