A man who challenged himself to do one new thing every day of 2012 to raise money for charity after his wife lost their baby has announced she is expecting again.

Richard Roberts, 31, started a blog detailing the one new thing he did every day of the last year - and asked readers to donate a penny for each new thing he did to the Ectopic Pregnancy Trust, after his wife Sian lost their first child.

After a year of completing tasks from the sublime to the ridiculous - ranging from conducting a philharmonic audience to eating a deep-fried Mars Bar - Richard has raised more than £2,000 for the charity.

And yesterday, on the 366th day of his blog, he touchingly announced he had become a dad-to-be, posting a scan of his unborn child.

Richard, from Thatcham, Berks, started the blog after kissing his new wife Sian on New Years' Eve 2011 - and realised it was the first time he had kissed his wife in 2012.

Down the hatch: Drinking Armadillo milk was another new experience, as was the Man vs Food challenge 

He also rescued a piglet and spent a day flying a hawk

He explained on his blog: 'As we drunkenly ushered in the new year in Central London, I grabbed my beautiful wife and gave her a big, lickery kiss! As I did this, I realised I had never brought in the new year by kissing a wife before!

'In my drunken excitement, I informed my pals that I would bravely keep this up for the whole of 2012; trying something new everyday!'

After Sian almost lost her life after suffering an ectopic pregnancy, Richard decided to use his resolution to help raise money for the charity which helped them through tough times.

He said: 'By the time we got to the hospital Sian had lost so much blood, we were told she was just hours away from death.

New acquaintances: Meeting newsreader Jon Snow on a train counted towards Richard's annual tally

The 366 tasks, which ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous, even included a nappy changing contest

After his year of tasks, including trying archery, Richard has raised more than £2,000 for charity

'I would give anything to have avoided that fateful day. Sadly, that is not possible.'

The resulting surgery meant Sian lost one of her fallopian tubes, diminishing the couple's chances of conceiving a baby in the future.

Richard's new things ranged from simple deeds - like going to introduce himself to his next-door neighbours, or changing the dirty nappy of a friend's baby.

But others were slightly more bizarre - including rescuing an escaped piglet at a children's farm, and chatting to broadcasting legend Jon Snow on the tube.

He's also turned his hand to archery, and spent a day handling birds of prey at the Hawk Conservancy Trust.

After trying a deep fried Mars Bar, engineer Richard posted: 'I had to have a shower after I finished...and I still felt unclean. Each mouthful took a day of my life.'

One particular low point was the deep-friend Mars bar, every mouthful of which Richard described as 'taking a year off my life'

Fortunately, his barbequed meat was more palatable

On January 8, he wrote: 'Finally got around to meeting our neighbours properly - Chris, Tracy & Joe. They ROCK!' and posted a photo of him with his new chums.

And on May 14th he posted: 'On the train home, Sian and I sat next to the legendary broadcaster, Jon Snow. He had just spent the evening at a charity event at the Royal Albert Hall, in the company of Prince William and Kate. Hmmm. I expect me and Sian were a bit of a disappointment after that!

'Jon Snow was a genuinely lovely fella. I ended up booking him a taxi from Newbury Station - and boring him senseless with this little blog! He seemed startled and confused when I told him that that he was my 'new thing for the day!'

But his thousands of followers were touched when on December 31, Richard wrote: 'Became an Expectant Dad! Today I am proud to announce that I'm a genuine, bona fide Father-to-be. And I could not be happier!

Getting to grips with wrestling

Yesterday,on the 366th day of his blog, Richard announced he and Sian are expecting again

'Please remember the reason for me embarking on this bonkers charity project; a few years ago, my wonderful wife, Sian, suffered an ectopic pregnancy. It took the life our wee baby, and it very nearly took my wife's life in the process. The subsequent surgery left my wife bereft on one of her fallopian tubes, thereby diminishing our chances of conceiving in the future.

'Although that fateful incident broke my heart, I was grateful that I still had my wonderful wife by my side! And we never gave up hope!

'And, as this post proves, I am glad we didn't give up- we are now expecting. We have a long way to go, so we aren't counting our chickens before they hatch, but we remain positive!

'If you have had a similar experience to my wife and me, I hope that this final new thing brings you hope too.'
