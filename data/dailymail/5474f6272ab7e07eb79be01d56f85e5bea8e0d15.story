Trevor Hicks today relived the 1989 tragedy which killed his two daughters alongside 94 other football fans

The father of two teenagers who were killed in the Hillsborough disaster has revealed the heart-breaking moment he had to identify his daughter's bodies on the pitch. 

Trevor Hicks was on the Leppings Lane terrace when he saw fans crushed in pens behind the goals where his daughters Sarah and Victoria were standing on April 15 1989. 

The teenagers were among 96 fans who were crushed to death at the match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. 

Their parents are among viictims' families giving evidence at a new inquest into the tragedy in Warrington. 

Today, he told of how he and his wife, Jenni, had travelled to the stadium with their daughters who 'gave them the slip' to watch the match from the stands with their friends. 

But around ten minutes before kick-off, the father said he noticed people being crushed up against the fence behind the goal posts where they were. 

'Some things burn in your memory but I saw an old chap, because I was much younger then, grey haired like me in a grey suit. 

'He really looked like he was dying stood up and looked unconscious and other people around him looked in distress.' 

Mr Hicks was standing on the terrace below the police control box and had tried to alert an officer to what was happening.

He said: 'We were calling up at him and then as I reported several times, he eventually turned to me and told me to, "shut my f*****g prattle".

He added: 'It was just getting worse. I’ve said this before, it smelt worse. You could sense that things were really, really bad.'

Then to his horror, he saw the body of his daughter Victoria being passed over the fence, 

Laid out next to her sister on the pitch, he tried reviving the teenager as two other men gave CPR to Sarah. 

Mr Hicks said it was 'absolute mayhem' on the pitch with just one St John's Ambulance cadet in sight.

Victoria was taken to a medical cubicle and pronounced dead around 10-15 minutes later, her father recalled.  

'As soon as I knew there was nothing I could do for Vicky my attention turned to find Sarah and what I could do for her.

'Again it was utter chaos in the hospital, people milling everywhere, there was casualties, bodies, people, police officers.

'The hospital staff were all over the place.'

After seeing their daughter's photograph on a wall of Polaroids 'of the dead', the couple identified their girls' lifeless bodies formerly.  

Jenni Hicks (left) and her husband (right) are among victims' families who fought for the original inquiry's ruling that the girls' deaths were accidental to be quashed 

Mr Hicks said: 'Basically they brought the girls out on to trolleys.

'They unzipped the body bags so we could identify them formally.

'Bear in mind Jenni had not seen either of them, she wanted to give them a hug, which she did and we noticed Sarah’s body was quite warm.'

The couple  then gave a statement to police and asked 'repeatedly how much they had had to drink before going home.' 

The following day, they were 'beseiged by the press,' he told the inquest. 

His account was heard at an inquest into the disaster following a High Court decision to quash the result of a 1991 inquiry which ruled the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans were accidental.

Ninety-six Liverpool fans were killed at the football stadium due to severe overcrowding. A man receives medical treatment on the pitch which Mr Hicks described as 'mayhem'

Fans on the terraces climb over each other to safety. Mr Hicks said he pleaded with police to take notice of the developing tragedy but was ignored 

When asked about earlier witness accounts which claimed Liverpool fans were 'blind drunk', Mr Hicks said he had no recollection of that.

'I'll probably get told off for saying this but it really does brass me off to have to listen to that,' he said. 

To suggestions that fans were 'pushing and shoving' to get into the grounds before the tragedy, he said: 'I must have been at a different game.' 

Mr Hicks added the way he was treated by police following his children's deaths was 'appalling'.  

The inquest continues.
