A formerly obese teenager has told how cruel taunts from bullies inspired her to get fit and become a beauty pageant queen.

Keli Kryfko, 23 - the current Miss South Texas titleholder - weighed more than 200lbs when she was at middle school and wore a U.S. dress size 24.

But at the age of 14 she decided to get in shape after hearing another student refer to her as 'the fat girl' when she failed a P.E. fitness test.

'I knew that that’s not what I wanted my definition to be anymore,' Miss Kryfko told CBS News.

In a bid to battle the bulge, one of the first things the Houston native did was ditch sugary sodas for water.

'I decided that I needed to make a change 
and I started by kicking out Dr Pepper which I always say was my 
toughest break-up to date.'

From there, Miss Kryfko started making other small changes to her diet.

'I just used logic,' she recalled. 'I thought, well I 
probably need to eat less fried foods and maybe I can eat the burger 
without the cheese.'

In a year-and-a-half she managed to lose around 70lbs and 100lbs in total. The natural brunette's transformation was complete with the addition of platinum blonde hair.

With a newfound sense of confidence, Miss Kryfko decided to explore the world of beauty pageants and witnessed quick success.

Her biggest wins so far include Miss Allen 2012, Miss Limestone 2013 and Miss South Texas 2014.

'It's really important to 
make time to love yourself and to compliment yourself'

She is now vying for the title of Miss Texas, with the contest set to take place in July.

Although she is half the size she used to be, Miss Kryfko says she's still curvier than the average pageant contestant.

'I like to think that it gives me an advantage,' she added.

Along with watching what she eats, the Texas Tech University graduate also fits exercise into her schedule.

 Murphy, a fitness trainer who is getting Miss Kryfko in shape for the 
Miss Texas contest, said weight loss is 80per cent diet and 20per cent 
exercise.
