Good Guys founder Andrew Muir and his wife have purchased a very sought after historically significant home

These amazing snaps show off the magnificent views of a special home which has been snapped up by Good Guys founder Andrew Muir and his wife Emma for a cool $19million.

It is called Baillieu House and it is on Point Nepean Road on the Mornington Peninsula in Sorrento, Victoria and was built in 1958. 

The Guilford Bell-designed home was listed as one of the top 10 Victorian dwellings featured in Neil Clerehan's book Best Australian Houses in 1961, reports Property Observer. 

The home was considered in the Survey of Post-War Built Heritage in Victoria in 2010 and it was decided that any house included in the study should automatically qualify. 

Property Observer reports the Melbourne home was selected because of its 'cutting-edge residential design of the day'. 

Views from the beach front home are simply spectacular and the home boasts an outdoor seating area perfect for entertaining family and friends on a summers night. 

The Sorrento home, who it is named after, was sold by Antony Baillieu when his wife Elizabeth died in early 2007.

Simply stunning: Andrew Muir and his wife Emma will now be able to have breakfast out sitting out on the grass looking at the ocean

The seaside home has the perfect combination for wowing guests and entertaining with this outside seating area 

The Guilford Bell designed Baillieu House is in Sorrento, Victoria, an hour south of Melbourne

It is easy to see why Mr Muir and his family wanted this spectacular home which also has beach views from the kitchen and living areas. 

According to property website Real Estate an average house in Sorento is currently on the market for $770,000. 

Sorrento is described as a 'historic seaside village with a contemporary & sophisticated shopping strip', by the Visit Mornington Penninsula tourism webpage.   

The home is located on a beach-side plot in the sought after suburb of Sorrento near Melbourne in Victoria 

Washing up or cutting your vegetables will be made all the more enjoyable with these amazing ocean views from the marble kitchen units 

Keeping it cosy: The beach-side home has a bit for everyone with a coal fire for when the temperatures drop 

The site says that the area has more than 60 retailers including restaurants, fashion shops, galleries and beauty centres. 

Sorrento is also believed to be the 'first European settlement in Victoria' which was discovered in 1803.

The site says that the area was later developed as a 'tourist destination for the rich and famous' by George Coppin from the 1870’s onwards. 

Mr Muir's father Ian built The Good Guys franchise from a single shop in Melbourne suburb Essendon in 1952.  

The picturesque home is beautiful inside and out and will be a very comfortable home for the Muir family 

The two storey house has lots of outside and indoor space 

With the house set at on the ocean for the best vies the rest of the plot gives the new owners lots of extra outside green space 

The company was initially called Mighty Muir and growth was quite slow to begin with. 

The family had 14 stores across Queensland and Victoria when they changed the company name to the Good Guys and they embarked on a big advertising campaign in 1998 to boost their presence.

The company has continued to grow and grow and by 2012 there were 97 stores across Australia.
