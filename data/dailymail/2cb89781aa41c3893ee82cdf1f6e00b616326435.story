A former police officer was left needing plastic surgery after having a chunk of his chin bitten off by an ex-lover.

Mother-of-two Tracey Pattison, 38, ripped a chunk of flesh the size of a plum from Michael Pattinson’s face as they struggled on the floor during a drunken late-night row.

Mr Pattinson, 41, says he now has vivid nightmares about being savaged by packs of wild animals and flashbacks of her mouth covered in blood.

But Pattison walked free from Teesside
Crown Court with a suspended prison sentence after admitting a charge 
of unlawful wounding.

Judge
Les Spittle told her most people would have expected her to be locked 
up, but he described that view as ‘over-simplistic’ in Pattison’s case.

The
court heard how the couple met through the internet and their on-off 
relationship had been blighted by arguments sparked by family 
heartaches.

Shaun Dodds, prosecuting, said a baby being stillborn in 2010 and a relative of Mr Pattinson being diagnosed with cancer had caused tension.

The couple arranged to meet on August 16 last year after a three-week break, and Pattison travelled to her partner’s home to see him.

Mr Pattinson says he asked her to leave following an argument, but she started to punch him and he grabbed her by the top of the arms to restrain her.

They struggled and fell to the floor, and as Mr Pattison lay there, he felt what he thought was a head-butt to the chin – until he saw the blood.

In an impact statement, Mr Pattinson said: ‘I thought I knew her. I didn’t see it coming.

‘I feel as though there is a horrible dark cloud over my life.

‘I
have had wild nightmares of being savaged by animals. I have flashing 
images of Tracey with my blood around her mouth. It’s the stuff of 
horror movies.’

Mr 
Pattison, who was an officer with the West Midlands and Durham forces 
and now works as a taxi driver, added: ‘I have no confidence in any 
relationships.

‘I cannot believe the whole situation 
has ended in me being scarred for life. There is no happy ending I can 
see. The whole thing freaks me out.’

Pattison,
of Mayfield Avenue, Newcastle upon Tyne, had denied wounding with 
intent to cause grievous bodily harm, but admitted the lesser offence at
an earlier hearing.

She pleaded guilty on the basis that she perceived she needed to defend herself, but accepts what she did was beyond reasonable.

Pattison
received a nine month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, and was
ordered to do 60 hours unpaid work and supervision.
