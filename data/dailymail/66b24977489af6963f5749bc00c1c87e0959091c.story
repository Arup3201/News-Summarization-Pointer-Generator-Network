'Bordering on wicked': Harries spiked his colleagues' morning coffee with speed

A bullied worker took revenge on his colleagues by offering to make their morning coffee then spiking the drinks with speed.

Paul Harries, 52, joked to his workmates that he had made them 'turbo-charged coffee' as he handed them the hot drinks laced with amphetamine, a court heard.

Within minutes of taking a sip his victims - who thought the senior supervisor had been referring to an especially strong brand of coffee - began shaking and suffering palpitations.

Both project manager Dean Ivey - who described feeling as though 'his hair was standing on end' - and operation manager Grant Fieldhouse needed hospital treatment after Harries spiked their drinks with the Class B drug.

Cardiff Crown Court was told that Harries felt he was being bullied at work after he reported staff for drinking alcohol while on duty at McGinley Infrastructure Services in Taffs Well, Cardiff.

Harries had complained about workmates he claimed to have seen drinking before working on a rail line.

The court heard how Harries found the the word 'grass' scrawled on his car after blowing the whistle on colleagues, and that he later blamed Mr Ivey and Mr Fieldhouse.

Prosecutor John Probert said: 'Harries offered to make the morning coffee and asked if they wanted turbo-charged or rocket-fuel drinks.

'They thought he meant a special strong brand he liked but within minutes both men felt ill.

'Mr Ivey had a dry mouth, goosepimples and palpitations. He felt like his hair was standing on end.

'Mr Fieldhouse started to shake and his heart was racing.'

Both men were kept in hospital until their raised heart rate and blood pressure returned to normal.

Harries was handed a six month sentence suspended for 12 months after admitting administering a poison with intent at Cardiff Crown Court.

Sentencing, Mr Justice MacDuff told Harries: 'This was bordering on wicked - it was a wholly unacceptable reaction to bullying.'

The judge added that Harries deserved credit for reporting alleged drinking on duty atMcGinley Infrastructure Services, in Taffs Well, Cardiff.

Harries, of Merthyr Tydfil, was ordered to carry out 100 hours unpaid community work.

Speed makes users feel wide awake and excited.

Side effects include feeling overactive, agitated, or even acutely psychotic. Taking the drug can also put a strain on the heart.
