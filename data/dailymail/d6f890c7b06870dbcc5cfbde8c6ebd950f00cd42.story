Radamel Falcao's arrival at Manchester United on deadline day created more excitement and headlines than any other transfer in the last window, including Diego Costa, Alexis Sanchez and Angel di Maria.

But the £3.8million wages - on top of a £6m loan fee - shelled out so far on the Monaco loanee have yielded just one goal, and the Colombian needs to prove his worth if he wants a permanent move.

United have until April to make up their minds and while Falcao wants to stay at Old Trafford, is he worth an additional £43m transfer fee when they already have Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney and emerging teenager James Wilson in the dressing-room?

Nobody doubts Falcao's talent. Anyone who watched his brilliant hat-trick for Atletico Madrid against Chelsea in the 2012 European Super Cup is aware this he is one of the world's outstanding centre forwards.

'He is the best striker in the world and it is a pleasure to have him. It's a luxury for us,' said Atletico's Mario Suarez at the time after Falcao had destroyed Chelsea's renowned back four.

But a serious knee injury sustained in January while playing for Monaco forced the 28-year-old to miss the World Cup and while he appears to be over that problem, other niggles have occurred, most notably a calf problem, since he has arrived at United.

It often happens to players returning after a long period but until Falcao starts hitting the back of the net with regularity, United can't be absolutely certain he remains the superstar player of two years ago.

Falcao has started only three matches in his three-and-a-half months at United. Van Gaal says with all his injury problems, match sharpness has been a problem.

Overall: Three starts, five substitute appearances, one goal. 

'Falcao needs match fitness. He can only play for 20 minutes,' said the Dutchman last week. 'I have selected him despite that but the rhythm of the game in the Premier League is the highest.'

Ideally, Van Gaal wants to give him a run-out in the Under 21s development squad but may still be tempted to use him at Aston Villa on Saturday. With United scheduled to play seven games in the next month, he will get his opportunity at some stage.

You may wonder having read all that why United opted to bring in Falcao in the first place given they were spoilt for choice up front anyway. If they hadn't signed him, they would have kept Danny Welbeck in any case as a fourth striker.

But Falcao, fully fit and firing, is a special breed. When transfer fees of £60m are quoted for PSG's Edinson Cavani, it's easy to forget that Falcao is probably the quicker, stronger and deadlier finisher of the two.

His only United goal so far, the winner against Everton in a 2-1 victory in October, gave a glimpse of his instinctive anticipation in the penalty area.

Angel di Maria's mis-hit shot was heading wide until Falcao, in line with the last defender, managed to reach it with his right leg and divert the ball past Tim Howard in a flash. It was marksmanship of the highest order.

If United could guarantee Falcao doing that 30 times a season, he would be worth the money.

But that is the difficulty so far – he hasn't shown that guarantee – and the renaissance of Van Persie, with four goals in his last four games, means it is crowded for the coveted No 9 position in the team.

Even Wilson from the academy was given a start ahead of Falcao for last weekend's 3-0 win against Liverpool.

Falcao is also on top, A-list wages - around £265,000-a-week, and the transfer fee to Monaco would put a dent even in United's considerable coffers.

Of course, they could afford it, but they will only want to pay out £40m-plus on two or three players in the summer, not four or five. Gareth Bale remains their gold-star target if the Welshman shows any signs of tiring of Madrid.

United have not given up on Falcao – he is too good for that. But there are choices to be made.

Van Gaal is not the type of manager to be blinded by reputation, as you'd expect for someone who has helped develop the careers of Patrick Kluivert, Andres Iniesta and Thomas Muller.

Falcao, who said this week he 'really wants to stay' at United beyond the summer will have to deliver on merit to make that happen.

'I hope it will work out. That is clear, I think,' said Van Gaal recently. 'Because of the (knee) injury, maybe we didn't buy him. We have him on loan but do you think that we expected he would be so many weeks injured (with other knocks)?'

Judgement day may be approaching for Falcao.
