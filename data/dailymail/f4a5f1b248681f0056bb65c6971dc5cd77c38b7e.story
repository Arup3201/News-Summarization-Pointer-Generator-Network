Found: Caleb Jacoby, the 16-year-old son of a Boston Globe columnist, has been found in New York's Times Square

The missing son of a newspaper columnist has been found after a multi-state search.

Boston Globe columnist Jeff Jacoby's 16-year-old son Caleb went missing from Brookline, Massachusetts on Monday afternoon.

The teenager was found in New York City's Times Square Thursday afternoon but no further details about how he traveled there were released.

On Thursday evening, Mr Jacoby announced the good news via Twitter to his more than 10,000 followers.

'Our prayers have been answered. We are thrilled to hear from the Brookline Police that our beloved son Caleb has been found and is safe,' he wrote.

'Words can’t express our gratitude for the extraordinary outpouring of kindness and support that we have received from so many people.

'All we can think of at this moment is how wonderful it will be to see Caleb again and shower him with love.'

Mr Jacoby has been a conservative columnist for the Boston Globe since 1994 and is a member of the modern Orthodox synagogue Young Israel of Brookline.

Caleb is still in the custody of the New York City police and travel arrangements are being made for him to be returned to his family in Massachusetts.

Happy news: Jeff Jacoby announced the discovery on Twitter Thursday night

Caleb's disappearance prompted an immediate and massive outpouring of support with hundreds of people volunteering to look for the boy.

Those who knew Jacob were shocked, as running off to New York was extremely out of character for the 11th grade student.

The teenager's Hebrew teacher, Efrat Lipschitz told masslive.com: 'We don’t know anything. We don’t have even a clue.'

'He took his studies very seriously. He took life seriously. He wasn’t easygoing.

'He's a very quiet boy, he's also a very good one. People really love him in school because he is a very good person.'
