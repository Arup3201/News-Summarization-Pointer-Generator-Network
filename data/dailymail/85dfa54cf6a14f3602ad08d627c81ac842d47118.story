Welsh pop star Duffy was forced to flee her £12million London home after a fire broke out in the penthouse.

The Smoke Without Fire star was said to be packing up her belongings ready to move out at around 7pm on Wednesday when her friends noticed smoke coming out of a vent.

The 28-year-old, real name Aimee Ann-Duffy, was unable to trace the source of the smoke, so they had to dash from the flat and watch helplessly from a nearby road as it was ravaged by flames.

Inferno: More than 60 firefighters battled for six hours to put out the blaze, which started at 7pm on Wednesday

Neighbours said that while the singer appeared dazed as she was led from the penthouse, which is on the ninth and 10th floors, her only thought for her two cats and a dog.

She managed to rescue the dog and one cat, but another called Felix disappeared in the chaos and Duffy was seen crying out: 'Where’s my cat? Come on, come here.'

Neighbour Maria McLeod. 47, gave the singer coffee after she fled the blaze but didn’t realise who she was at the time.

She said: 'I gave her a cup of coffee and she said her cleaner was there and needed some too. She was lovely, just in shock.

'I asked her what had happened. She said "that’s my flat!" kind of half-laughing in shock.'

Maria, who said the Grammy-award winning star was dressed casually in 
leggings and ballet pumps added: 'She had her friend and cleaner 
with her. She said they were moving out today.

'They were getting ready to pack up and 
they saw smoke coming through the vents.  They saw the smoke pouring 
out, checked the rooms and couldn't see any fire.

'She said that when she left the flat
she had to shout "Felix this is your last chance!" She thought they 
would have to leave him there. I just felt sorry for her.'

Rassa Borghei, 58, who lives on the 
fifth floor, said: 'She was running about all over the place. When the 
police arrived they calmed her.'

A friend eventually found the cat 
hiding under a white van and after being reunited with her owner, the 
two were driven away in a black Mercedes just before 10pm.

More
than 20 other residents in the block weren’t so lucky — they had to 
spend the night in a nearby rescue centre after being told to evacuate 
their flats.

Damage: Fire marks can be seen outside of the property, where firemen rushed to the scene

Wrecked: The star fled the building in a panic with her cats and dogs as 60 firemen battled the flames for six hours

While Duffy’s cats escaped without injury, neighbours say the singer also had pet goldfish. Their fate is unknown.

More
than 60 firefighters battled for six hours to put out the fire, which 
started just before 7pm, and crews were continuing to dampen down the 
building yesterday morning.

An investigation has been launched.

The
rented apartment has its own swimming pool, cinema and two outdoor 
terraces. Duffy was due to leave the property in the next few days.

A London Fire Brigade source said the
gutted penthouse, which sits atop a 1960s block in upmarket Kensington 
has also suffered extensive water damage and that the cause of the 
inferno is still unclear.

Safe and sound: The Grammy winner managed to leave the property but had to watch from the side of the road as the blaze took hold

The
source said: 'It's very badly damaged up there at the minute. There's 
still a lot of water up there too. Our investigators are still working 
on the roof to establish the cause of the fire. 

'We're not sure at the moment whether the owner would be able to return to collect any possessions today.'

Surveyors could be seen entering the property in hard hats yesterday afternoon.

The fire comes just as the singer, 
whose full name is Aimee Ann Duffy, was beginning to make her first 
tentative steps back into the music world.

She
rocketed to fame in 2008 with her debut album Rockferry which sold 
1.6 million copies but her second album, Endlessly, had disappointing 
sales and last year her record company announced she was taking an 
extended break.

A former 
manager is suing her for breach of contract and last May she split up 
with Welsh international rugby star Mike Phillips.

It is thought she had recently returned to the recording studio and was due to perform in the United Arab Emirates this month.
