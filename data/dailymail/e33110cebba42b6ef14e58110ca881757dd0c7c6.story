'Social situation': Romanian prime minister Emil Boc resigned today and ended his government after weeks of protests against austerity measures

The Romanian prime minister today announced his immediate resignation at that of his government, claiming he wanted to protect the stability of the country.

Emil Boc said he was resigning 'to ease the social situation' after weeks of mass protests in Romania over austerity measures he introduced in 2010.

Opposition politicians have now called for early parliamentary elections, which are currently scheduled for November.

President Traian Basescu named justice minister Catalin Predoiu to replace Mr Block as interim head of a government whose popularity is languishing in opinion polls.

The Romanian parliament has 60 days and two attempts to approve a new government. If it fails, the parliament is dissolved and new elections will be called.

However the ruling coalition and its partners have enough votes to elect a new government.

Mr Boc, who became prime minister in 2008, urged Romania's feuding politicians to be mature and rapidly vote for a new government.

He defended his record, saying that he had taken 'difficult decisions thinking about the future of Romania, not because I wanted to, but because I had to.'

He added that the International Monetary Fund has forecast growth of up to two per cent in Romania this year - lower than expected, but higher than the EU average.

Mr Basescu will hold talks with the political parties later today about the formation of a new government.

Crin Antonescu, who heads the opposition Liberal Party, said: 'This is a victory for those that demonstrated on the streets.'

He said 'the most corrupt, incompetent and lying government' since the 1989 anti-communist revolt had gone.

Victor Ponta, leader of the opposition Social Democratic Party, said he would ask for early elections.

Romania signed up for a €20billion loan with the IMF, the EU and the World Bank in 2009 to help pay salaries and pensions after the economy shrank by more than 7 per cent.

In 2010, the government increased sales tax from 19 per cent to 24 per cent and cut public workers' salaries by a quarter to reduce the budget deficit.

Last month, Romanians staged weeks of protests to express anger at cronyism and a perception that the government is not interested in the problems of ordinary people.

They protested against low standards of living, widespread corruption and the passage of some laws without parliamentary debate.

Mr Boc added: 'I know that I made difficult decisions, but the fruits have begun to appear.

'The most important thing is the economic stability of the country. In times of crisis, the government is not in a popularity contest, but is saving the country.'

Committed to adopting the euro under the terms of its accession to the EU in 2007, Romania is the eurozone's second poorest member and is still struggling with the economic legacy of communist state control.
