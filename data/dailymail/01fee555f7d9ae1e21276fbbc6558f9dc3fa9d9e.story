A bank has applied to repossess the home of an 80-year-old Alzheimer’s sufferer after giving her a mortgage she could not hope to repay.

Just seven months before the credit crunch struck, Irene Rose Hearn, then 74, was allowed to take out a £470,000 interest-only five-year mortgage by the Abbey National.

Experts say it would be ‘virtually impossible’ for Mrs Hearn to take out such a loan in today’s more prudent lending climate.

Mrs Hearn, a widow with 13 grandchildren, had been hoping to repay the loan by selling the house because, at the time, property prices were rising and the economy was booming.

But the financial crisis means she is unable to pay it back by selling up as the £675,000 house has plunged £200,000 in value. She is now facing a court battle to keep the family home.

In 2006, three years before her family say her Alzheimer’s set in, Mrs Hearn, a retired property developer, agreed to pay a monthly mortgage bill of £493 even though she could afford it only with help from her son Rodger, 58.

But when this deal ended, she was put on a new repayment loan arrangement by Santander, which took over Abbey, and was told she had to pay £4,219 a month.

Unable to make the repayments on her £594-a-month pension, she fell into debt and was taken to court by the bank, which won a repossession order on the house, which her son arranged to have built for her.

The family are challenging the court decision, but may lose the detached four-bedroom house in the exclusive area of Lilliput in Poole, Dorset, near the millionaires’ playground of Sandbanks.

Her son, also a property developer, said: ‘This is appalling behaviour by a bank. Santander messed up by giving her the wrong mortgage and are now saying they want their money back.

Irene was granted the mortgage by the Abbey National just three years before her Alzheimer's set in

‘So they forced a mortgage on her that she simply could not afford so that they could repossess the house and get some of their money back.

How could any bank force a ten-year repayment mortgage on an 80-year-old? It’s madness to think she could afford to pay £4,000-a-month. She’s retired.’ 

The heartbreaking case comes just before a damning investigation by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) is expected to reveal the full scale of the interest-only mortgage scandal, which some experts fear could be the next mis-selling debacle.

Around 40 per cent of homeowners who have a mortgage have an interest-only loan, which means they only pay the interest every month, but not a penny of the actual loan.

In recent months, some of Britain’s biggest mortgage lenders, such as the Nationwide, Co-Op, HSBC, RBS, have all stopped selling these controversial types of mortgage.

Santander now insists on a 50per cent deposit to secure an interest-only loan.

Mrs Hearn, a frail pensioner who now lives in a care home, was originally offered the five-year interest-only mortgage for £470,000 by Abbey National in December 2006.

Her son claims the house he built two years earlier was worth £675,000 at the time, but fell to £450,000.

So when the five-year term was up, Mrs Hearn, who has four grown-up children from her marriage to Ronald Hearn who serviced power stations and died at the age of 63 in 1990, would not have been able to sell the house without making a loss as it was worth less than the £475,000 mortgage.

Her son attempted to remortgage his mother’s house to allow for a recovery in property prices.

But Santander instead put her on a ten-year repayment mortgage of £4,219-a-month - an increase of 750per cent on her interest-only repayments - which she would have to repay by the age of 90.

Mr Hearn, who now lives in the house, said he blames the resulting stress for worsening his mother’s condition.

He said: ‘My mother’s illness has deteriorated since this began and I think the stress of losing her family home has not helped.

‘I have lost sleep and my marriage broke up as a result of this. If we lose this house, I’ll be selling the Big Issue. I feel victimised and I don’t know when I’m going to be homeless.

‘They mis-sold a mortgage to my mother and forced a loan on her which she has no hope of paying back. This isn’t unusual. They’re doing it up and down the country.’ 

David Hollingworth from the mortgage advisors London & Country said it would be ‘virtually impossible’ for a woman in her 70s to take out this type of loan nowadays.

Typically, any mortgage must have been repaid by the time the homeowner reaches the age of 70 or 75, he said.

A spokesman for Santander said that following an FSA review of the mortgage industry, lenders can no longer offer mortgages to those of retirement age.

He added that ‘sale of the property’ is no longer considered an appropriate way to repay an interest-only mortgage.

A spokesman for Santander said: ‘Repossession is always the last resort for Santander. We always consider every option to keep a customer in their home, including looking at alternative payments plans and terms.

‘In line with this policy, we have fully explored the options open to Mrs Hearn, and whilst we are of sorry that she is losing her home, Mrs Hearn has been unable to make the payments due on her loan.’
