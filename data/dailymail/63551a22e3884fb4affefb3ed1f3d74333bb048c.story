A rare pink diamond that surfaced in 2013 to fetch $40million at auction has fueled a feud among relatives of a late Italian senator as his son claims the stone was stolen by a backstabbing step-sibling.

Amedeo Angiolillo, who currently lives in New York, filed suit against Christie's on Friday, alleging the auction house had sold off the 300-year-old, 34.65-carat Indian diamond to an anonymous buyer on behalf of someone other than its rightful owner.

Named the Princie Diamond, the pink gem 'is one the rarest, perhaps most famous and illustrious pink diamonds in the world,' according to the complaint filed in Manhattan supreme court.

Rare: The Princie Diamond that surfaced in 2013 to fetch $40million at auction has fueled a feud among relatives of a late Italian senator as his son claims the stone was stolen by a backstabbing step-sibling

According to Christie's website, the diamond received the name after being purchased at auction by jewelers Van Cleef & Arpels, who named it in honor of the 14-year-old Prince of Baroda, son of Maharani Sita Devi. 

The gem had been passed down through generations of Indian rulers before landing in the possession of Mir Osman Ali Khan of Hyderabad, who eventually sold it through Southeby's. 

The jewel came into Angiolillo's family's possession when his father, Renato Angiolillo, the founder of Italian newspaper Il Tempo, purchased the stone in 1961, the New York Post reports.

Having just wed his second wife, Maria Girani, Renato made a gift of the diamond - one that carried a caveat. 

Renato's new bride would 'not have unfettered access to' her husband's collection of precious stones, according to the complaint. 

The arrangement would last up until the newspaper magnate's death in 1973, when Amedeo cut a deal with his step-mother that allowed her to continue wearing the diamond, the lawsuit states.

The younger Angiolillo agreed to let Girani hold onto the diamond 'because she was quite active and influential in Italian politics and sponsored political, social and business meetings at her home,' a gift Renato bequeathed her in his will.

'Girani had a good relationship with her husband’s children and grandchildren, confirming on several occasions that the gems in her possession, including the Princie Diamond, belonged to them by inheritance, and that they would be returned to them after her death,' according to documents filed. 

Yet when Girani, too, passed away in 2009 and her husband's heirs came looking for the precious stone, they say it wasn't among her belongings. 

Pedigree: The Princie Diamond was once owned by a succession of Indian rulers, the last of which was Mir Osman Ali Khan of Hyderabad, who sold it through Southeby's

Girani's son, Marco Bianchi Milella, who had once been friends and even roomed with his step-brother Angiolillo, claimed he never saw the diamond among his mother's possessions,

Yet Christie's later told Angiolillo that Milella told them he was the '100 percent beneficial owner of the Princie Diamond,' according to the lawsuit. 

However, Christie's anonymous consignor bought the diamond 'in good faith' during a closed-door deal in Switzerland, and the auction house refused to stop any sale, in spite of a lawsuit working its way through the courts of southern Italy, the Daily Beast reported.

Police even seized other gems that had once been in Renato's collection at Milella’s home in Monte Carlo, which included a ruby necklace he'd given to his girlfriend, the lawsuit states..

'New York law provides that once there is a "thief," an involuntary transfer, or if the property is lost in the chain of title, no one can take good title,' the lawsuit argues against Christie's claim that a 'valid title' was provided by a Swiss entity.

Angelillo and his nieces and nephews are suing to recover the diamond, which Angelillo claims to have an insurance certificate proving his claim to ownership, along with damages.
