Azerbaijan will make its debut on the 2016 Formula One calendar.

A move for Baku, the capital city, to host the race was first revealed by Sportsmail in March.

It had been thought it would be ready to stage its inaugural grand prix next season, but it was confirmed on Friday the first race will be now held a year later. Â

The event will become F1's latest street race, joining the likes of Monaco and Singapore, with Baku's old medieval city and the Caspian Sea forming part of the backdrop.

It will also become the venue for the European Grand Prix which has been absent from the calendar since Valencia dropped out in 2012 over a failure to meet the race fee.

'I am delighted to officially announce that we have signed a contract to bring Formula One racing to Baku in 2016,' Azerbaijan's Minister of Youth and Sport, Mr. Azad Rahimov said.

'Our location at the crossroads of eastern Europe and western Asia is a new frontier for Formula One racing.

'Azerbaijan is a modern European country that has established a reputation as a centre of sporting excellence.

'The deal to bring Formula One racing to Baku is a very significant new chapter in our ongoing success to attract the world's largest sporting events to our country.'

Bernie Ecclestone was key in reaching the deal for Azerbaijan to stage its first race and marks another step in taking the sport across the globe, and in particular to eastern Europe, with Moscow to stage its first grand prix later this year.

The announcement also comes after it was confirmed that Mexico would stage its first race in more than two decades next season.

'We are very happy that Baku has joined the Formula One family,' said Ecclestone.

'This will be a street race, which will pass through interesting and picturesque parts of Baku. 'The event will meet the current Formula One criteria.'
