Case: 'Broken woman' Caroline Woollen stole nearly £160,00 from her employers to bankroll a series of expensive holidays for her boyfriend

A manager of a global offshore company who stole almost £160,000 from her employers spent nearly all the cash on taking her boyfriend on luxury holidays to stop him from leaving her.

Caroline Woollen tricked her Danish employer, Nordic Offshore, into believing she had secured lucrative contracts for them with Shell and Siemens.

Company bosses paid her £159,000 to hand 
to workers to complete the contracts - but she instead spent the money 
on a campervan, skiing holidays and a £10,000 luxury trip to Canada.

Woollen, 33, has now been ordered to pay back just £10,000 - after the court heard that she had spent all of the cash.

Hull Crown Court heard that her partner had left her after her deception was uncovered.

Now, although Judge David Tremberg has ruled Woollen, 33, made £158,634 from her crimes, she has only been ordered to repay £9,240 because she has spent all the stolen money and has no other assets.

The court has ordered she pays the money directly to Nordic Offshore as compensation within 28 days or face six months in prison under the Proceeds of Crime Act.

Woollen, from Brough, East Yorks, pleaded guilty to fraud between April 2011 and May last year.

She was charged with stealing £387,609.13 but pleaded guilty to stealing £159,000.

Hull Crown Court heard Woollen, who had been drinking up to three bottles of wine a night, was a fantasist who led a 'Walter Mitty existence'.

Her barrister, Anil Murray, said: 'She wanted to be loved by her partner. She wanted to please him.

'Once this offending was uncovered, her partner left her.

'She is a broken woman.'

Deceptive: Woollen managed to convince her bosses at Nordic Offshore Marine - which specialises in providing offshore personnel - said she had secured lucrative deals to get them to authorise payments

The court heard Woollen even lied to her family about her accomplishments, claiming she was at drama school and college when both were untrue.

Woollen had previously defrauded a different company in 2010 and had been convicted of writing a false invoice.

Nordic Offshore, which supplies skilled personnel to the offshore industry, was unaware of her previous convictions when she secured a job with them after pretending she had excellent contacts with Siemens and Shell.

Her first task was to apply to the UK Border Agency for a licence allowing the firm's employees to work in the UK, but she failed to make the approach.

She lied to her employers, creating fictitious emails pretending she had.

Hearing: Hull Crown Cour was told Woollen, who had been drinking up to three bottles of wine a night, was a fantasist who led a 'Walter Mitty existence'

Woollen then said she had obtained contracts with major firms, requesting thousands of pounds, which she claimed she needed to pay contractors.

Prosecutor Jharna Jobes said: 'She admitted all of this offending and said she was trying to impress her boyfriend and her family.

'She went on skiing holidays, funded a £10,000 holiday to Canada with her boyfriend and talked about all the parties she had attended using company money.'

Woollen was sentenced to two years' imprisonment, suspended for two years, was ordered to attend an alcohol treatment course and carry out 300 hours of unpaid work.

Judge Simon Jack told her: 'You are a victim of your own personality and your need to please those around you.'
