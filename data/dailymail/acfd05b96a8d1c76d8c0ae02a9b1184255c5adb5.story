Taxpayers paid out more than £2,300 a month for a council chief executive Bryn Parry-Jones to drive around in a luxury Porsche, it was revealed today

Taxpayers paid out more than £2,300 a month for a council chief executive on a £195,000 a year salary to drive around in a luxury Porsche, it was revealed today.

Chief executive Bryn Parry-Jones' high-powered office car was leased at more than £28,000 a year, and funded by taxpayers in Pembrokeshire.

Then, the cash-strapped council had to pay £8,600 to end the hire contract on the Porsche Panamera when Mr Parry-Jones, 62, quit his post last October. 

The highest earning council boss in Wales had the sleek £90,000 Porsche leased for him while earning a salary of £195,000 plus benefits, earning him more than the Prime Minister - who is paid £142,500 a year.

The car, a favourite of popstars and professional footballers, cost the council a further £2,368 a month - and over the course of the year added up to more than the average annual salary of £26,500.

A graduate nurse is paid around £21,000 a year, while a newly qualified teacher would be on a starting salary of £22,000. 

Last month, Pembrokeshire Council was ordered by the Information Commissioner to reveal the full cost of the hire car within 35 days. 

A local councillor then revealed that ending the lease agreement ahead of schedule had cost £8,670. The council has confirmed this figure was correct.

Mr Parry-Jones was handed a £280,000 golden goodbye, despite the fact he had been forced to quit over a suspected unlawful payments scandal.

Details of his car only emerged at the start of December after a long Freedom of Information battle with the council.

Insiders said the extravagant expense had 'stuck in the craw' of cash-strapped council workers who knew about it for months.

Campaigners and politicians hit out at the 'offensive waste of money' at a time when the council was making cuts to local services.

Last year, Pembrokeshire Council revealed it would have to make savings of £20million over two years. Proposed measures include closing public toilets, charging for social services and increasing parking fees. Council tax rose by 3.4 per cent this year.

Paul Miller, who leads the opposition Labour group on the Independent-controlled council, said: 'Why a council chief executive needed a Porsche is completely beyond me.

'It's an absolute disgrace, the way he used to operate that council was outrageous.

'He was a dictator and it got to the point where he thought he could do whatever he wanted and it was council tax payers who footed the bill.'

Mr Parry-Jones came under pressure to resign from his post after it was revealed he had taken cash payments which the Wales Audit Office said were unlawful. 

The payments to Mr Parry-Jones were investigated by police, who later decided there was no evidence of wrongdoing, and no further action should be taken.
