With the same name as a Christian saint and a son called Gabriel, it might have been with a sense of inevitability that Terisa Tuffin discovered a holy sign as she prepared some food.

Mother-of-one Terisa was slicing an orange when she saw the heavenly figure of an angel appear in front of her.

Nursery school teacher Terisa, 41, said that she found the sighting of the angel in her kitchen reassuring after she had a spate of bad news.

Her nine-year old son Gabriel had recently been diagnosed with a kidney problem, and she had discovered that her child maintenance payments were to be cut.

Mother Terisa Tuffin found an angel looking back at her when she was making her daughter's packed lunch

The orange was the only piece of fruit that she had at home in Lindfield, West Sussex.

She said: 'I decided to cut it in half and put a half each in Gabriel and my 13-year old daughter Tarlie's packed lunch for school.

'When I noticed the angel appear it brightened my mood and it was as if someone was watching and looking after me' she added.

'My son has been quite ill and there was unfortunate news about the maintenance payments so I was feeling a bit sorry for myself, so it was a lovely image to see.'

Seeing holy images in everyday objects is a surprisingly regular occurrence.

This massive image of Jesus was spotted while searching Google Maps in Hungary

This year alone, Christians in Florida claim to have seen a goldfish-shaped biscuit with a cross and halo on it, and Jesus on the back of a carton.

Another American believed he had seen a Christ-like figure in his cheesy crisps.

Google Maps also shows many heavenly images as people look for formations in fields, such as Jesus' face in the Hungarian countryside.
