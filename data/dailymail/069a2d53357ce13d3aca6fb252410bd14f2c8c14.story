Cheered: Tory MP Daniel Kawczynski with Prime Minster David Cameron

A divorced Tory MP and Cabinet aide was cheered and clapped by his local party after telling them he is gay.

Daniel Kawczynski received a standing ovation when he told 30 activists from Shrewsbury Conservative Association that he had a male partner.

Mr Kawczynski, 41, who was born in Poland, has made history as the first MP to make it known that he is bisexual.

Shrewsbury Tory chairman Robert Osborne, who was at the meeting, said last night: ‘It was a very brave thing for Daniel to do and he did it with great aplomb.

He received huge support from members of the association and there was never a shadow of doubt that he would.

‘He made the announcement at the end of the meeting and we moved on straight away.’

Well-placed sources very close to the MP say that although he currently has a male partner,  he has not ruled out future relationships with women.

The MP feared his decision to ‘come out’ could prompt a hostile reaction from activists in his constituency in rural Shropshire, with many traditionalist and elderly supporters.

He was delighted and relieved by the response when he announced at a meeting: ‘I want to tell you that I am with a guy.’ 

Those attending burst into spontaneous cheering and applause. Some hugged Mr Kawczynski; others praised him for his courage and honesty.

He is said to feel a huge weight has been lifted from his shoulders. The Mail on Sunday was told by authoritative sources that Mr Kawczynski has candidly stated he is uncertain over the true nature of his sexuality.

The MP, popular and respected at Westminster and in his constituency, has told friends: ‘I don’t know what I am.’

Standing ovation: Mr Kawczynski said he 'feels a weight has been lifted from his shoulders'

Until now, he has been best known as the tallest MP in history: at 6ft 8½in, he towers over his colleagues. Last year, David Cameron gave him his first Government post as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Welsh Secretary David Jones. It is the first rung on the parliamentary ladder to ministerial status.

He was recently divorced from his wife, Kate, who worked as his office manager. Catholic Mr Kawczynski is a leading member of the Christian-based, Right-wing Tory Cornerstone group, most of whom are sceptical about gay rights and same-sex marriage.

The MP agonised before deciding to vote in favour of same-sex marriages earlier this year.

In an unexpected and innovative move, he called a public meeting in his constituency before making his mind up on the issue.

He was inundated with hundreds of letters from constituents arguing passionately in favour, or against, the measure.

In announcing he would vote in favour of same-sex marriages, he gave a profound and moving insight into his soul-searching on gay rights.

In an open letter to voters, he said: ‘I understand and fully appreciate that there may be many who do not share in my views.

My decision however is one of principle which I have come to after a long period  of reflection – I do not believe same-sex marriage will undermine the union of a man and  a woman.’

Explaining how his faith guided him, he wrote: ‘My convictions as a God-fearing man, and as an individual that believes equality for all, have led me to decide that I will vote in favour of the Same Sex Marriage bill.

‘My faith is essential to everything I do and think. I remember vividly the experiences I had as a child when I was first brought to the church pews:  I learned the basic principles of justice, fairness, equality under the eyes of God, and sacrifice and respect for our fellow man.

This is an experience which I am sure most of us shared at the beginning of our Christian lives.

‘When considering voting against same-sex marriage, I realised I could not do so without feeling as if I was at risk of not fulfilling my Christian duties.’

But he continued: ‘Society has come a long way since homosexual acts were illegal and punishable by law. The age of consent for homosexuals is the same as heterosexuals and gay couples can now adopt.

‘I cannot call myself a Conservative and a defender of a principle crucial to our national identity if I vote against allowing all who wish to express their love to another to do so through a legally recognised marriage.’

Last night Mr Kawczynski refused to comment.
