A stunning collection of silk scarves feature photographs of real photographs taken by the NASA Hubble Space Telescope.

Printed on fine silk material, the mindblowing high definition pictures feature exploding nebulae and thousands of twinkling stars in burnt orange, deep navy and tropical turquoise.

The space
 scarves are designed by Celine Semaan Verno from independent design label Slow Factory, who ship worldwide.

Slow Factory obtain their designs from 
open-sourced NASA images to make their sustainably-produced silk 
scarves, report VICE.

The ethereal accessories are made using only organic materials and socially responsible vendors, and cost from £47 to £118.

Slow Factory designer Celine Semaan Vernon said: 'I learned a lot from working with the open-knowledge, open-source 
movement and how it allowed people to connect to one another.

'Inspired 
by NASA's publicly-available satellite images and by collaborating with 
other artists, our nebula and supernova collections were created to be a
 reminder of how we can find beauty and connection in the cosmos.

'Now that I've made a home in New York, the bright city lights make it 
harder to see the stars. But if I can help people feel a little more 
connected with our cosmic silk prints, I will be happy knowing that I've
 made a small impact in a really big way.

'Quality trumps quantity. Everything is consciously made in collaboration with craftspeople using sustainable practices: Our natural fabrics are sourced from a socially and environmentally responsible company in India, and each limited edition piece is handcrafted in Montreal and New York from NASA’s open data collection of satellite images.'
