Australians will be given a rare, real insight to the World War One experience through a new documentary series, which uses the diaries, letters and speeches written by six Australians, telling stories using their own words - bringing them back to life 100 years after the Great War began.

The War That Changed Us gives a fresh insight to war, telling the untold, true stories of the people.

On the centenary of the beginning of WWI, Australians are given an opportunity to connect with six Australians who were struggling with war, either on frontline or waiting at home.

Historians and film makers were both involved to create the four-part ABC 'dramatised documentary', creating storylines that are 100 per cent based on documented evidence.

Episode one: 'Answering the Call: 1914-1915' airs on ABC on Tuesday 19 August at 8.30pm.

Historian, Dr Clare Wright was crucial to ensure the screenplay accurately captures the true individual human experiences of war.

‘(This series) is about having a sense of empathy and connection with the characters, especially as they represent a number of experiences of the war. It shows a complex picture of what it was like to be a part of that wartime society,’ said Dr Wright.

'As it is a documentary, we stay between the bounds of fact. We can't make things up that didn't happen. But luckily, the truth is often stranger than fiction!' explains Dr Wright.

'Stories are very powerful in their real incarnation.'

Historian Dr Clare Wright was crucial to telling the stories of six Australians wartime experiences in their own words, in this groundbreaking documentary

The characterisation of the six main personas is entirely based on their own word, using 'diaries, letters and correspondence, as well as the speeches they made, the public record they left, newspapers and archive research.'

‘We found characters that left descriptive, detailed archives behind them. We needed to tell their own story. We see the war as they saw it, feel like they felt. It’s not a contemporary reading or what we think they have felt or experienced. We’re actually put in their shoes to see the war play out in real time.’

The personal accounts of war are some of the most frank, emotional and sensory descriptions of six very different war experiences. We are intimately acquainted with three men and three women, all engaged in the war in different ways, including those at war, those waiting at home, and those that fiercely opposed not only war, but conscription.

The War That Changed Us: The actors in character. The documentary uses the actors to tell the true stories of six Australians, using the exact words of the people represented. The screenplay was created using the detailed, emotional accounts the six people each left of their wartime experiences.

‘We looked at the way the way war changed the six people as individuals and how the whole country changes,’ Said Dr Wright

‘War was part of the daily fabric of everyone’s lives, everyone was touched by war.’

Dr Wright worked with the series’ director, Don Featherstone to write the screenplay, which she calls ‘a close and positive collaborative experience to bring two backgrounds and skills together.’

‘He is a professional in film and television and a magnificent storyteller. I could bring my own expertise and experience as a historian and that was a really wonderful working relationship,’ said Dr Wright.

The primary sources that carry the story are ‘vivid, detailed and consistent,’ giving a rare insight into not only the events that took place, but how the people involved felt during the terrifying, brutal war that claimed more than 40,000 lives between 1914 and 1918.

Two of the characters include 24-year-old soldier Archie barwick, played by Myles Pollard, and Lieutenant Colonel “Pompey” Elliott, re-enacted by Luke Hewitt.

Archie left a diary which is described as one of the top five war accounts.

‘Archie Barwick wrote in his diary from a trench in Gallipoli. We hear his own words as he talks about his feelings. Just like Archie, we don’t know what the next day or even minute might hold for him. He knows and we know that death might be imminent,’ said Dr Wright.

In the diary, Archie wrote:

‘Everything in this diary is true and anyone reading it can believe what’s written. I hope all at home can find something of interest for them, for that is the reason that I’m writing it.

‘My job will be to bring it home safely.’

Luke Hewitt, who brought husband and father Pompey back to life, is currently in Europe, visiting Australian World War I memorials in Begium and North Eastern France on the anniversary of the breakout of the war 100 years ago.

‘Standing at the memorial sites that was the overwhelming question...why? I know there are complicated political and Empirical answers to that question,  but I could not think of a simple one.

‘I feel extremely fortunate to have this opportunity… It was an overwhelmingly emotional day, to stand on the very ground where so many thousands of Australians lost their lives during this conflict. It gave us (my wife and I) both pause to reflect on the futility of war and how little we seem to learn from it.’

Luke Hewitt read extensively to understand the real “Pompey”, and was moved by the words that remain for us to remember a man that time may otherwise have forgotten.

‘I read everything I could get my hands on. Much of it, historical accounts and journals of his war service.

'The best preparation I found was reading a biography written by Ross McMullin called "Pompey Elliott" which was full of Pompey's own words, letters home to his wife and children, accounts of him by soldiers who served under him and reports and communications on the battles he was engaging in.’

Historian Dr Ross McMullin was involved in the series and agrees that Pompey’s written words reveal him to be a complex, compelling man.

‘I was blown away reading the diaries and letters of Pompey Elliott. He was very frank and forthright – he called a spade a bloody shovel! As a commander he was tempestuous, controversial but outstandingly successful.

‘But his letters underline how much he loved and cared (for his family) and lamented the fact that duty as he saw it lead him away from them for five years,' said Dr McMullin.

Pompey’s correspondence with his wife are a treasure when it comes to understanding the impact of the war.

‘Pompey's letters with his wife Kate are extraordinary. He had arranged with Kate to have a no-secrets pact in their correspondence while they were apart, so the letters are frank and illuminating.'

Mr Hewitt was moved by passages of Pompey’s writing.

‘After the fateful battle of Fromelles (Pompey) stood in the trenches, tears streaming down his face shaking the hand of every soldier returning from the fight and saying "I'm sorry... I'm sorry...".

'And although he was the consumate soldier, his letters home to his wife and children were extremely emotional and loving - yet graphic regarding the nature of the conflict. He was a very complicated man.'

‘Reading the personal accounts, not only from Pompey but from others at that time, gives you a connection to the emotion they were feeling. The sounds, the smells, the existence they were forced to endure comes alive. I think it allows you to perhaps imagine yourself in their place.

In playing the role of "Pompey", studying his letters and visiting memorials, Luke Hewitt still cannot make sense of the 'futility' of war and enormous loss and tragedy that occurred, despite it being 100 years since the war began.

In revisiting the past, Dr Wright, hoped to complicate people's understanding of WWI.

'The further we are from historical events, the simpler they are and it’s easier to make sense of it. It’s important to realise that the people in those times, like us, found it hard to understand or make sense of the events. It helps us empathise with World War One.'

Hewitt, in engaging with the stories of World War One, believes there is no sense can be made of the hurt, destruction and loss that occurred during the war.

'Yes. I have a greater understanding now of how the war effected not only those away fighting, but those at home. 60,000 telegrams delivered to families advising them that there loved one was gone.

'156,000 telegrams delivered advising their husband, son, brother was wounded or worse taken prisoner. What a fearful 4 years, 3 months and 1 week they must have been. Waiting.'

Australians may find some of the experiences and messages of the film are far too relevant to our own lives.

‘We realise in revisiting this time in history that we don’t always learn from the lessons of the past,’ said Dr Wright.
