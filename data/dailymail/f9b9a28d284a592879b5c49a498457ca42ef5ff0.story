Sports psychologist Dr Bob Rotella has delivered a 10-point guide to winning The Open on the MailOnline. Looking through the list, no wonder Rory McIlroy is so keen to see him or a fellow shrink. Scrolling down Rotella’s commandments, McIlroy currently meets barely one.

Over the past six years we’ve seen many different emotions from the  mercurial Northern Irishman. We’ve seen him exultant, frustrated, angry, despairing, overjoyed and resigned. But we’ve never seen him quite like he was here, when he stood in front of a media throng and, looking thoroughly lost, admitted he needed help.

And people thought Wayne Rooney was confused.

Looking glum: Rory McIlroy suffered a nightmare start in his quest to win the Open

In the rough: McIlroy attempts to play out of trouble on the 14th

Beached: Caught in the bunker, McIlroy attempts to recover with a shot on the green

Psychologist Bob Rotella spoke to Sportsmail on the eve of the Open.

Now read his detailed 10-point plan towards winning at Muirfield.

What a truly compelling first round 
this was at The Open, where drama walked arm in arm with controversy and
excitement and anger stared each other in the face.

Amid all the noise about an unfair 
course set-up and silly pin positions, it shouldn’t be forgotten that 
former Masters champion Zach Johnson shot 66 in the morning to lead 
after day one and 56-year-old Mark O’Meara came in with a 67 in the 
afternoon.

Tiger Woods, showing once more his 
relish for parched links courses — the only time he has won outside  St 
Andrews was at burnished Hoylake in 2006 — delivered a masterclass of 
patience and craft for a 69.

How bad, then, could it have been? 
Pretty bad for Justin Rose and Graeme McDowell, who shot 75, and 
terribly bad for Luke Donald, who won’t be getting off the mark in 
majors here after blowing his chance with an 80.

Tough day: McIlroy and his caddie look on during the opening round at Muirfield

Frustration: Walking up the fairway, McIlroy adjusts his cap and cuts a dejected figure

And then there was the man in the 
middle of a Muirfield maelstrom, for whom it was as bad as it could 
possibly be following a 79 that included a horrendous back nine of 42 
shots. Wouldn’t you know it — McIlroy, the game’s most sublime talent, 
had tied Sir Nick Faldo, celebrating his 56th birthday and playing his 
first event for three years.

Just to complete Rory’s day, after he
had conducted an admirably candid interview, who should he bump into 
outside the clubhouse but Faldo, the man who told him to ‘concentrate on
golf.’ Faldo claimed to be a friend of McIlroy’s but the fact is the 
pair never have anything more than a perfunctory conversation from one 
month to the next. Here, they shuffled off in opposite directions 
without a word exchanged.

JAN 20: Misses cut and finishes tied 98th at the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship. 

MARCH 3: Walks off the course at the Honda Classic in the second round. He is seven over par but cites toothache as the reason for his withdrawal.

MARCH 24: Loses his world No 1 ranking to Tiger Woods.

JUNE 30: Just two weeks after finishing 14 over par at the US Open in joint 41st, misses cut at the Irish Open.

JULY 18: Shoots a 79 to finish the first day of the Open at eight over, and admits he is struggling with the mental side of his game.

Looking at Rotella’s 10 points, it is hard to see where McIlroy could answer in the affirmative. Point six, for example: Mental toughness and emotional resilience will see you through. Right now, Rory has neither.

Point eight: Be decisive and totally committed to every shot you play.
Are you kidding? If truth be told, all Rotella’s points are basic 
common sense, which is one of the reasons why McIlroy hasn’t seen him in
years. When he’s at his best and it’s all natural and instinctive and 
he hasn’t a care in the world, there’s nothing any sports quack could 
tell him.

But it’s not just his new driver that
is pear-shaped these days. Off the course there are two lawsuits 
nagging away at a usually untroubled mind. Is it really beneficial to 
have his long-time coach Michael Bannon travelling everywhere and 
whispering technical sweet-nothings into his ear each day on the 
practice ground? Has the jet-set lifestyle played its part in bringing 
him to the point of this astonishing confession?

Keeping pace: Nick Faldo also finished his opening round eight over par

Eye on the ball: Faldo tees off on the fourth at Muirfield

Inspection: Taking a moment to think, Faldo walks on the 11th green

‘BRAIN DEAD’

It’s just so brain dead. Seriously, I feel like I’ve been walking around out there like that for the last couple of months. I’m trying to get out of it. I just don’t quite know why.

‘I’M UNCONSCIOUS’

It’s nothing to do with technique. It’s all mental out there. And then I just need to concentrate, obviously. But sometimes I feel like I’m walkingaround out there and I’m unconscious. I just need to try to think more.

‘ALIEN FEELING’

It’s a very alien feeling, it’s something I’ve never felt before.

‘I’LL SEE A SHRINK’Yeah, I’ve worked with Bob (Rotella, sports psychologist) before a little bit. And, yeah, it could be beneficial to see someone likethat again, we’ll see.

They are all things McIlroy will 
surely consider as he returns to the drawing board and tries to address a
slump that is moving rapidly from the ‘these things happen in golf’ 
stage to something approaching genuinely worrying. Tom Watson talks 
about golfers being at their best when all they hear is a perfect 
silence but McIlroy can’t think straight these days because of the 
almighty racket.
And is he overthinking matters? ‘Overthinking off the course and underthinking on it,’ said McIlroy, ruefully.

His body language is terrible. Every 
small blow and he looks like a man who’d rather be anywhere but on a 
golf course. At the 15th, he putted from just off the front of the green
into a bunker that protects the back of it. As he said: ‘Just so 
thoughtless, so brain dead.’

Dr Gio Valente, the sports 
psychologist who has done so much to bolster Rose’s self-belief, thinks 
McIlroy needs to follow through on seeking help as a matter of urgency. 
Of course he would say that, you might think, but he makes some 
interesting points.

Not going to plan: McIlroy looks on after playing a shot

Look away now: Hiding behind his cap, McIlroy reacts after playing a shot

‘I have watched Rory a lot since he 
got to world No 1 and what I would say is that while he has a terrific 
game and can hit superb shots I am not sure he has the mental tools at 
this stage,’ he said. ‘I think 100 per cent he needs help on the mental 
side of the game.

‘When he has confidence he is a 
brilliant player, but when it goes wrong I don’t think he has learned 
the mental processes that can protect his confidence. With Justin, he 
won the US Open a few weeks after missing the cut at the Players’ 
Championship. He has learned to protect his confidence. Rory doesn’t 
seem to have that skill.’

McIlroy’s demise was the lowlight of a
disappointing day in general for the vaunted home challenge. Rose can 
be excused, for the first round after the excitement of winning your 
first major is never easy, and he actually played well for much of that 
round before, in his own words ‘letting it get away from him.’

As for Donald, this was a savage 
setback after playing so well in the last major at Merion. Even Ian 
Poulter, going along so well at two under par after 13 holes, was an 
angry man after bogeying four of his last five holes for a 73.

Indeed, not one of the 13 players who
broke 70 were from these British Isles. A day to forget then — but 
McIlroy’s meltdown will live in the memory.
