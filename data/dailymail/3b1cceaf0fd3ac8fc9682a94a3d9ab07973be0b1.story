A former LA gang member who has been listed as one of the LAPD's most-wanted fugitives for the last 12 years has finally been arrested, after police tracked him down using Facebook.

Eduardo Rodriguez, 35, who was wanted in connection to four 2003 murders, was apprehended on Thursday after a detective  on light duty for an injury noticed him in photos uploaded to Facebook by other active gang members.

Rodriguez had been living under the alias Juan Carlos Campos Gamino for five years working as a carpenter and even had a fiancee, who did not know about his hidden life.

According to The Los Angeles Times, he was second in command to the Tooner Ville Rifa 13 gang, run by Timothy McGhee.

McGhee was sentenced to death in 2009 for his role in three separate homicides, however is alleged to have been responsible for at least 12 others between 1997 and 2001.

Rodriguez, also known as Juan Carlos Campos Gamino, disappeared soon after he was indicted in 2003 on four counts of homicide and two counts of attempted homicide.

He was charged with the 2001 shooting death of Margie Mendoza, 26, a mother of three who was gunned down in Atwater Village while sitting in her boyfriend’s car.

His other charges are unclear, but are somehow related to Mendoza.

Following an 11-year manhunt, a detective in Glendale got a break in the cold case last year.

The cop, who was familiar with Toonerville gang members and their associates, spotted Rodriguez while trawling Facebook.

He traced the fugitive to a woman, who turned out to be his fiancee.

Police tracked down the address of the woman and staked out her house.

After Rodriguez was positively identified, U.S. marshals moved in.

Rodriguez was captured in the 3500 block of Farnham Place in Riverside at about 6.30pm Thursday.

'You could see that moment when he knew what it was about and he just gave up,' U.S. Marshal's Service Deputy Laura Vega told The LA Times.

'He saw the cars, he gets his hands up ... he still had his (gang) tattoos.'

Vega said Rodriguez's fiancee and her family were at home at the time of the arrest.

It was clear they had no idea he was a fugitive.

'She seemed genuinely pretty shocked,' Vega told the paper.

According to NBC Los Angeles, neighbors described Rodriguez seemed like 'a normal father-of-three'.

However there is no further information on any children.
