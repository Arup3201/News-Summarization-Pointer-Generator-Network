His character has a tendency to bite but it will be the fans who will be getting their teeth into this version of 50 Shades of Grey actor Jamie Dornan.

The life-sized replica, which is entirely made from cake, takes centre stage in the 50 Shades of Cake display at Cake International's Sugarcraft Cake Decorating Show in Manchester.

Created by baker Rosie Cake-Diva, the cake depicts a topless version, complete with a rippling six-pack, of the 50 Shades of Grey protagonist  with his belt undone and jeans unzipped.

The display also features peep holes into exotic edible designs, many of them X-rated, and whips made from liquorice. 

But it is Mr Grey who is the star of the show, with not one but two cake versions of the character taking pride of place.

'One is at the entrance and one is revealed inside partially dressed,' said Ms Cake-Diva, who also revealed that both are 6ft tall and made of Genoese sponge.

'They were constructed from 10 rectangles of 17' x 28' cakes, made using 25kg of flour and 340 eggs,' she continued. 

The baker and her team of six took two and the half months to construct the edible Mr Grey and used 200kg of sugar paste to craft his exterior.

The Christian Grey cake is set in a 50 Shades inspired room decorated with  scenes from the forthcoming film.

Along with the cake centrepiece, the display features edible props such as lacy underwear made from liquorice, a cover of the 50 Shades book and exquisitely decorated masks.

'The accessories are made from sugar paste and liquorice,' Ms Cake-Diva continued. 'The bed [is] for posing for photos with Christian Grey. 

'The top of the chest of drawers is made from cake, and the elements of the two scenes set beyond peep holes contain cheeky edible elements.' 

Visitors will get glimpses of the props through peepholes. One shows the top half of a woman's body covered with a lacy bra, while another offers an X-rated glimpse of another part of the anatomy.

Less jaw-dropping is the peephole showing a beautiful black mask, complete with intricate white sugar work swirls.

The exhibition also features a fully dressed Grey - also made of cake -  clad in a grey business suit, his hands tightly gripping a tie.  

Hitting cinemas on February 13, the 50 Shades of Grey film, directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson, is based on the very popular erotic novel of the same name written by E.L James.

Famous for explicit scenes involving bondage, dominance and BDSM, the book, which was released in 2011, was a hit and was followed by two more instalments - 50 Shades Darker and 50 Shades Freed.

It was recently revealed that 50 Shades is set to be the raunchiest blockbuster film in over a decade, with 20 minutes of sex in its 100-minute running time.

The motion picture adaptation also stars Rita Ora, Marcia Gay Harden, Jennifer Ehle, Max Martini, Luke Grimes and Sloise Mumford. 

In order to stay loyal to the story, director Sam Taylor-Johnson did extensive research into the world of BDSM before filming started.

She recently revealed that she consulted a professional dominatrix for the film, which is more than two hours long, and said she 'learned a lot' from her.

She told The Independent: 'The sex scenes are pretty intense, so I'm sure people are going to feel aroused - but I've seen them so many times that I tend to forget.' 

Jamie Dornan recently revealed to Glamour magazine that he had found some of the scenes difficult to shoot.

He said: 'There were times when Dakota was not wearing much, and I had to do stuff to her that I'd never choose to do to a woman.'

And Dakota admitted that Jamie would be the first person to cover her up, telling the magazine: 'It's stressful enough to be tied to a bed naked in a scene.

The highly-anticipated  film is out on February 13, just in time for Valentine's Day

'But then they call cut, and you're still tied to the bed, naked. Jamie would be the first one to throw a blanket over me.'

The movie is one of the most highly anticipated films of the year, with the trailer having already been watched a massive 45million times on Youtube.

Cake International's  Sugarcraft, Cake Decorating & Baking Show is the largest of its kind in the world, with 70,000 people expected to attend  across three venues in Manchester, London and Birmingham
