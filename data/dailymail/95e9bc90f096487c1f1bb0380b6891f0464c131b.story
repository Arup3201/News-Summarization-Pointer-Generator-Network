Police in India seized thousands of kilos of cannabis then destroyed the haul by setting it on fire.

The huge discovery was made by officers in the town of Kharupetia in the state of Assam in the North East of the country.

Scores of bags were then emptied onto the ground and set ablaze.

It is not known exactly how large the haul was but recent raids in the area have recovered as much as ten tonnes of the illegal crop.

Cannabis cultivation has become rife in the towns and villages of Assam in recent years.

It is used not not only a transit route to other parts of the country but also offers a lucrative market to dealers.

Cannabis production in the remote region of India has become rife as farmers can make more money from it than any other crop

India's Narcotics Control Bureau has been carrying out repeated raids and destruction of the crop in a bid to clamp down on the trade.

The unit has burned hundreds of acres of land where villagers have been cultivating cannabis which grows wild in the area and can generate more income than any other crop.

A kilo of cannabis currently sells for around Â£60.
