As George Zimmerman ramps up his fundraising efforts, those who donate to his cause will be given an unusual piece of memorabilia - his autograph.

Zimmerman, 29, remains in hiding as he awaits trial for fatally shooting 17-year-old Trayvon Martin earlier this year in Sanford, Florida.

The former neighborhood watch leader's attorney said Wednesday that Zimmerman plans to launch the New George Zimmerman Defense Fund next month with a new fund manager that Zimmerman himself will choose.

Personal touch: As a 'thank you' gift, those who donate to Zimmerman's cause will receive cards personally signed by the former neighborhood watch captain

As a 'thank you' gift, each donor will receive cards personally signed by Zimmerman.

A statement on the GZDefenseFund.com said: '[Zimmerman] would like to 
send a NOTE OF THANKS to all donors who do not object to receiving one.'

Zimmerman has been charged with second-degree murder in the February 26 shooting death of Martin, a Miami teen who was in Sanford visiting his father.

Zimmerman, who was on watch that night, called 911 to report a suspicious man who looked like he was 'up to no good.'

The man was the 17-year-old Martin, who was returning to his father's girlfriend's house from a nearby store where he purchased Skittles for his little brother and an iced tea for himself.

Opening up: Donations poured in on George Zimmerman's fundraising website after he spoke exclusively to Fox News's Sean Hannity

The Hannity interview is the only time Zimmerman has appeared on camera since he was bailed out of jail on

Acting against the wishes of the 911 operator he followed Martin, and the two got into a scuffle that ended with Zimmerman firing one shot into Martin's chest, killing him.

Zimmerman claims he was acting in self-defense when he fired the shot.

The fundraising site claims that Zimmerman's lawyers are yet to collect a legal fee, saying that the funds will primarily pay off his personal and living expenses.

His attorneys said that they will only be paid with money left over.

The site says that donations poured in 
after Zimmerman appeared on Sean Hannity's Fox News program to give an 
exclusive interview, but those funds are now running low.

Attorney Mark O'Mara said an existing fund has raised $140,000 since last May, but the money needs to be replenished.

Currently, the balance of the George Zimmerman Defense Fund is at its lowest, and new funds must be raised to support George's living expenses and legal costs through the end of the Self Defense Immunity Hearing and/or trial.

Zimmerman has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder and claims the shooting was self-defense under the state's 'stand your ground' law.

A murder trial is set for June, but a 'stand your ground hearing' could be held by April.
