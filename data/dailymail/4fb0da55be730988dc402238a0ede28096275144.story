A naked rambler has won a long battle to overturn his conviction for causing distress to a female dog walker who said she saw his genitals.

Naturist Nigel Keer, 42, will now be continuing his nude hiking - once the weather warms up - after a panel of judges gave a list of reasons to quash his conviction.

Mr Keer appealed after magistrates found him guilty of the public order offence of causing distress to the woman as she walked her dog at a beauty spot called Otley Chevin, West Yorkshire, last October.

Overturned: Naturist Nigel Keer, 42, will now be 
continuing his nude hiking - once the weather warms up - after a panel 
of judges gave a list of reasons to quash his conviction for causing distress to a female dog walker

The decision comes just two days after a man known as The Naked Rambler was released from serving his latest prison sentence.

Stephen Gough celebrated his freedom by taking a hike in his birthday suit through nearby Peebles.

The 53-year-old was jailed for five months after he was arrested in July for being naked near a play-park in Dunfermline.

Meanwhile, a judge at Leeds Crown Court told Mr Keer that his charge would be dismissed because the panel considered it unlikely that Mr Keer’s naked walk had caused any alarm.

The court had heard that Mr Keer was arrested by off-duty police officer PC Mark Buxton, who said he saw a woman appear 'distressed' when she had noticed Mr Keer rambling in just his hiking boots on October 2 last year.

Relieved: Bus driver Mr Keer, of Leeds, West Yorkshire, had denied the distress claims, and said naturism 'is about body freedom'

Sitting with two justices on Monday, Judge Guy Kearl said PC Buxton, who said he had been shocked by the incident, would not have been able to determine if the woman was distressed.

Dismissing the charges, he added: 'This behaviour was not carried out in front of a school or in the street in a town centre. It took place on moorland in broad daylight.

'In view of the location of this incident, the time of day and the reaction of others as we have found it to be, we do not consider that anyone was likely to be harassed by this behaviour or intimidated or distressed.'

The judge said there were no sexual motives behind the incident, adding: 'He was not deliberately flaunting himself or seeking attention or jumping out and doing what is colloquially called flashing.'

He said that the police officer’s reaction to seeing Mr Keer could also be considered 'extreme given his experience.'

Bus driver Mr Keer, of Leeds, West Yorkshire, had denied the claims, and said naturism 'is about body freedom and in a way it is a mild protest against the expected social norms of wearing clothes every day'.

Speaking after the case, Mr Keer said that he was delighted to have finally fought off the charge, which had kept him out of work for a number of months.

He added: 'I’ve kept up the naturism, but I’ve been a bit more careful now. It’s a bit cold to be doing anything at the moment, but once the weather warms up, I’ll be back out there.'

Mr Keer has previously taken part in three naked world bike rides alongside other naturists.

He had first become interested after being sent a letter from British Naturism in 2004.

He initially thought it was a prank but he went on a naked swim anyway, leading to his love affair. He has even put it on his CV as an interest.

When the case first came to court last October, he said: 'I must admit that I was surprised when it came to court.

'I don’t feel I have committed an offence or distressed anyone. People are a lot more accepting now than they were five or six years ago. On the whole, most people are quite happy with it.

'I love walking about naked. It’s the feeling of being at one with nature and a feeling of liberation. If you are free of clothes you are free of worries.'
