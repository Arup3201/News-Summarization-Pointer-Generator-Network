Modern love: Erica Domesek sought out the help of American Airlines' Twitter account after finding the man of her dreams on a flight, but missing his last name

A New York City woman who decided a guy she met on a flight was the man of her dreams managed to reconnect with him despite forgetting his name thanks to Twitter.

Emily Domesek had some help from the kind folks at American Airlines, who she initially tweeted at to help her in her quest.

They were slow to lend a hand, but when they did her message went viral.

'Dear @AmericanAir: just got off my 
flight with my future husband, but didn't catch his full name,' Domesek 
tweeted in the first of a string of correspondences with the airline.

Domesek, who founded a do-it-yourself company called P.S. - I Made This, was on her way from Dallas to Calgary.

'Wanna be match maker #flight1037,' she asked @AmericanAir.

At first, American Air did not. They responded, but only to the tune of 'best of luck.'

Domesek kept pressuring them.

'@AmericanAir
 what happened 2 romance? I'm just a girl, standin in front of the 
world,asking an airline to help her (2 quote Nottingham Hill).'

And
 her persistence paid off. The airline declined to directly contact the 
mystery man, but they did give Domesek a platform that reaches over 
780,000 followers on which to ask the public for help.

'@AmericanAir
 he was sitting in the front row first class wearing a blue sweater, his
 name is Clauco. He was born in Torino & lives in soho,' she wrote.

No shy: Domesek asked American Airlines to contact the man. They refused, but when she persisted, they finally gave in a little and let her use their public conversation as a platform 780,000 followers strong for finding love

Love takes flight: While things didn't go smoothly for Domesek at first, she eventually found her wings (and her guy)

While
 thousands saw the tweet, and no doubt asked themselves if they knew a 
Clauco from Turino, it was a real-life friend of Domesek's who led her 
to her dream man.

He was spotted in an Apple store and one thing led to another.

'To
 close the book on this story. The universe brought us together & 
he's amazing. FULL STOP. #romance CC: @AmericanAir,' she wrote.

She then went on the further detail her success, though exactly where things now stand remains unclear.

'@AmericanAir
 all I an say: I'm grateful to Flight1073, my @SamsungMobileUS watch (w/
 his photo) & friend I saw @ Apple store who knew him xo,' she wrote
 coyly.

American Airlines responded:

'@psimadethis That's #AAmazing! We hope you'll live Happily Ever After. Invite us to the wedding, virtually of course.'

Pay off! Domesek's persistence and willingness to publicly air her search for a man she'd met only briefly paid off, though she's keeping most of the details private
