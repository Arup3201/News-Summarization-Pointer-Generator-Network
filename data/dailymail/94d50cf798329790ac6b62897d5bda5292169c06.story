A daredevil performed a spectacular Houdini-like stunt 200ft above the ground on the London Eye today in front of crowds of people on their way to work.

Death-defying escapologist Jonathan Goodwin was hung upside down and trapped in a straitjacket and had only minutes to escape from a burning rope attached to one of the famous landmark's capsules.

The stunt was filmed for his new television show The Incredible Mr Goodwin which starts on Watch this Thursday at 9pm.

Crowds were tense as the professional danger man struggled to release himself from the burning rope positioned more than 200ft in the air as, with seconds to spare, the flames appeared to engulf Mr Goodwin's jacket.

Just as things were heating up on the South Bank, the escapologist threw his jacket to the ground to rounds of applause from stunned onlookers. 

Mr Goodwin, from Pembrokeshire, south-west Wales, has been described as a modern-day superhero, somewhere between Harry Houdini and Superman.

He said: 'Danger is a part of my profession and the adrenaline I get from each stunt I do drives me on to the next.

'Pushing the limits is exciting and I hope I have left the crowd with a memorable experience.'

Mr Goodwin came into the spotlight 
when his stunt Cheating the Gallows went wrong live on national 
television and he was hung. He survived the incident, suffering only 
minor rope burns.

He has also been buried alive, locked
inside a box with 200,000 bees, set in concrete, burned at the stake, 
and sewn up inside a dead cow to name just a few of his feats.
