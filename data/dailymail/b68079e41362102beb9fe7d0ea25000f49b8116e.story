A Florida mother has been granted an emergency motion to prevent her son's circumcision.

Heather Hironimus gave birth to her son Chase, who is three-and-a-half, with Dennis Nebus in October 2010.

In December 2011, she signed a parenting agreement, court records obtained by the Broward-Palm Beach New Times show.

That agreement, which was rendered in January 2012, said Nebus would be responsible for scheduling and paying for his son's circumcision.

Two years later, Hironimus changed her mind about the circumcision. Last Wednesday, she testified in court that she did not want Chase to 'undergo requisite general anesthesia for fear of death,' records show.

Urologist Dr. Charles Flack said in court that though circumcisions are not necessary, 'penile cancer occurs only in uncircumcised males and uncircumcised males have a higher risk of HIV infection than uncircumcised males,' according to records.

In his ruling last Friday, Judge Jeffrey Gillen said 'there is no reason' why the circumcision shouldn't take place.

That ruling also said that Hironimus 'shall not in any way lead [Chase] to believe that she is or was opposed to his being circumcised, whether or not she accompanies [him] to the procedure.'

Hironimus, on a GoFundMe page to 'Save My Son from Circumcision,' says only Chase, whom she describes as 'fully aware,' should be able to decide whether or not to have a circumcision.

'I am pleading with fellow intactavists [sic], parents and all others to help me save my son, his foreskin, his rights and hopefully other children from allowing the "system" to make these decisions,' she says.

As of this writing, Hironiums has raised $5,228 of her $10,000 goal.

On Wednesday, a West Palm Beach court granted Hironimus an emergency motion to stay.
