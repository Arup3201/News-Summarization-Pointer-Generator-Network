Countless people have noted quirky differences between men and women.

But now a survey has revealed that different sexes are often drawn to different coloured iPhones.

Research looking at which colours of iPhone 5S and 5C sold best following their launch on September 20, confirmed some gender stereotypes.

Apple's luxurious iPhone 5S handset comes in three colours: space grey, silver and gold, while its colourful iPhone 5C model is available in five colours: blue, white, green, pink and yellow.

Chicago-based Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) examined buying behaviour of the two new handsets.

Their study found men predominately chose space grey, while women preferred the lighter and more sparkly silver option.

For the iPhone 5S, space grey accounts for 43 per cent of all sales of the handset.

Interestingly the gold iPhone 5S, which was originally reportedly in short supply, accounted for 27 per cent of sales and was equally popular among men and women.

The U.S. study, based upon 400 people, found that men favoured white and blue models of the iPhone 5C handset, while a third of women opted for pink, - but neither men or women were particularly taken with Apple's yellow offering

Apple's high-end iPhone 5S handset launched in three colours: (from the left) gold, space grey and silver. At launch, the gold-coloured handset was the most sought after and is the most gender-neutral,the study said

However, sales of the iPhone 5C could be seen to reflect gender stereotypes.

Men favoured white and blue models, while a third of women opted for pink, but neither men or women were particularly taken with Apple's yellow offering.

The study was based on 400 subjects in the U.S. the company said.

CIRP Partner and Co-Founder Mike Levin, said: 'iPhone 5S and 5C colours seem to confirm some traditional gender biases.

In the iPhone 5C, men prefer the neutral white and the space gray in the iPhone 5S.

CIRP's research found most men favoured space grey, while women preferred the lighter silver-coloured iPhone 5S. Space grey accounts for 43 per cent of all sales of the handset

The company also revealed that out of all the iPhone 5C handsets sold, blue and white were the most popular colour, while space grey was the most in-demand when it came to the iPhone 5S handsets

'In contrast, women prefer lighter silver 5S and the brighter iPhone 5C colours.

'Interestingly, no one, including the women in the survey, appears to want the Yellow iPhone 5C very much,' he said.

The company also revealed that out of all the iPhone 5C handsets sold, blue and white were the most popular colour, with a 27 per cent and 25 per cent share of sales, while yellow phones were the least popular with a measly share of just seven per cent.
