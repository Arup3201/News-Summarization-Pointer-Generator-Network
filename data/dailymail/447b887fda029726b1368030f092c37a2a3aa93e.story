A tiny workman uses a crowbar to try and lever open the ring pull of a Coca-Cola can, while a miniature skier prepares to make his way down a mountain of granulated sugar.

Such surreal scenarios are commonplace in the world of little people captured by artist and 'macro photographer' David Gilliver who specialises in extreme close-up photography.

The Guernsey-based finance worker, 34, spends hours scouring the internet to source his figurines, which are mainly intended for use on model railway sets.

'The little people fascinate me,' he said.

'I enjoy finding new figures frozen in a particular pose - it almost feels like I have to then find a task for them to complete or be involved in, helping them fulfil their purpose.

'More often than not, I place the figures inside scenarios where they have a gargantuan task to complete which sometimes invokes a sense of sympathy inside me for them.

'I guess I am a hard taskmaster.'

Each image takes around an hour and a half to pose and shoot, and the Channel Islands artist says he is constantly on the hunt for new scenes.'It is actually quite tricky to make the scenario feel convincing, and so a lot of thought goes into the placement of the figures and the props, and the nature of the scenario itself,' Gilliver said.

'Normally I will try to create something that involves an element of humour.'

Gilliver began producing the latest little people series at the tail end of 2011, using a DSLR camera and a macro lens.

However, the artist has used figurines in his photography as far back as 1999, during his Fine Art Photography degree at the Glasgow School of Art, where he was inspired by photographers like American artist David Levinthal.

'I always joke with people, saying that I obtained my degree by playing with toys, which on the face of it, is difficult to argue against,' the artist said.

'I am a very keen landscape 
photographer, and I think my initial interest was born out of an effort 
to find a completely different style of photography to interest myself 
in.

'Table-top photography could not be more different to landscape photography.

'Instead
 of attempting to capture a vast expansive landscape using a wide-angle 
lens, I am instead trying to capture a miniature scene using a 
macro lens.'

The series has proved a big hit online, with the artist running regular competitions on his Facebook site asking viewers to come up with slogans to accompany each shot.

Each work in the series is temporary, with individual little people often getting the chance to star in more than one scene.

'I will normally find multiple uses 
for each figurine which I think the little people are quite happy about -
 they would get pretty bored otherwise,' David said.

'I
 have quite a few ideas stored up. Whenever a good idea enters my head, I
 try to write it down as it is so easy to forget them.

'The longer I spend creating these miniature dioramas, the better I think I get at it.

'Because
 the figurines are so small, setting them up is an incredibly delicate 
operation, especially if I am using multiple figures that are in close 
proximity to each other.

'So here's hoping I am getting closer to creating that ultimate mock-up.'

'I take a lot of enjoyment from seeing the final shot, which normally results in a lot of laughter,' he said.

'I like the idea of using these miniature people to depict more serious issues that reflect current and contemporary problems around the world. 

'I tend to receive an amused reaction from most people,' he added. 'That is to be expected though as most of the images do convey some element of comedy.'
