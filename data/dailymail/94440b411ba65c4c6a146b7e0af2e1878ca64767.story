She appeared in Playboy in 1994, posed nude again at the age of 58 and published a series of searingly honest books about being the daughter of Ronald Reagan.

But Patti Davis has denied her latest book - about a woman falling in love with her sister-in-law - is autobiographical and said she is not a lesbian.

The controversial daughter of the late President has self-published the book, called Till Human Voices Wake Us', on Amazon, where it is being sold for $3.

Ronald Reagan's daughter Patti Davis said her new novel about a lesbian relationship is not autobiographical

She told the NY Post: 'This is not me. None of it is autobiographical.'

Despite being known for her liberal views and once appearing in the Playboy video Celebrity Video Centerfold, Davis did not want to write explicit sex scenes in the novel.

She said: 'I didn't want to write Fifty Shades of whatever. It's a love story.'

Davis wrote on her Amazon page that she decided to publish the book herself after receiving a number of rejections from publishers.

The former actress believes the subject matter of a woman who embarks on a lesbian relationship after the death of her son may have put the industry off.

She wrote: 'I am a published author -- 8 books -- but
I find myself in the same situation many authors do these days.

'Getting
publishers to say yes is really hard. I've dipped my toe into 
self-publishing with my novel, Till Human Voices Wake Us.

'It made the 
rounds of publishing houses, garnered a lot of interest but no offers.

'I've written a lot about my famous family, the Reagans -- maybe this was
too much of a departure for publishers to wrap their heads around. But 
now there is KDP and the room to publish a book yourself. It's exciting 
to me -- a new era in publishing.'

Davis, who changed her surname to her mother's maiden name while at university, is well-known in the U.S. for her autobiographical books about growing up in the public eye and her clashes and later reconciliation with her parents Ronald and Nancy Reagan.

Her first book, Home Front, was published in 1986 and describes coming of age in the 1960s and 1970s.

Davis, who used to date Bernie Leadon from The Eagles, famously held liberal views, which often clashes with her conservative father including opposition to nuclear weapons, being pro-choice and supporting gay rights. 

Davis later reconciled with her parents, especially as they coped 
with her father's Alzheimer's disease. She supported her mother during 
her father's lengthy public funeral in 2004.

In recent years she has also written books that portray her family in a more positive light.
