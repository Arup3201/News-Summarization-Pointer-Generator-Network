A devout Catholic Australian couple, who have been married for 55 years, stumped the Vatican this week when they gave a speech about the importance of sexual intimacy in marriage.

Ron and Mavis Pirola, from Coogee in Sydney's eastern suburbs, addressed more than 182 bishops and the Pope during the synod in which they spoke about the importance of family life and shared their belief that 'sexual intercourse' is the fullest expression of marriage.

'That attraction that we first felt and the continued bonding force between us was basically sexual,' the chair-couple of the Australian Catholic Marriage and Family Council said in their speech.

'The little things we did for each other, the telephone calls and love notes, the way we planned our day around each other and the things we shared were outward expressions of our longing to be intimate with each other. 

'Gradually we came to see that the only feature that distinguishes our sacramental relationship from that of any other good Christ-centred relationship is sexual intimacy and that marriage is a sexual sacrament with its fullest expression in sexual intercourse.'

The synod, which will be held over a fortnight, will see a total of 13 couples speak about their experiences in an effort to help the Catholic Church approach the subjects of family with their modern day followers.

Following the Pirola's speech, British cardinal, Vincent Nichols told the Guardian: 'That's not what we bishops talk about mostly, quite honestly.'

'But to hear that as the opening contribution did, I think, open an area ... and it was a recognition that that is central to the well-being of marriage often.' 

But an unconcerned Mr Pirola told Daily Mail Australia that there was nothing controversial about his speech. 'There was nothing we said that is not fully in keeping with the church's teaching,' he said.

'In regard to sex it should be fairly obvious – were a married couple why else would you get married? You want to be intimate with each other because you are in love and that leads to children and that's what marriage is all about; loving each other and wanting to spread that love.

'That attraction that we first felt and the continued bonding force between us was basically sexual,' the couple said in their speech

'People seem surprised but it's just common sense. It's just natural and all of the bishops we've spoken to are quite supportive and happy.' 

Further along in their speech, the Pirolas also told the Vatican of their Christian friends whose 'gay son said he wanted to bring his partner home' to a Christmas gathering. 

'They fully believed in the Church's teachings and they knew their grandchildren would see them welcome the son and his partner into the family. Their response could be summed up in three words, "He is our son".'

'Gradually we came to see that... marriage is a sexual sacrament with its fullest expression in sexual intercourse,' their speech said

 Despite admitting that he and his wife were careful when wording the anecdote, Mr Pirola again insisted that the opinion their voiced was in keeping with the church's teaching.

'The general point we were making was in context of a broader point… The church is trying to promote clear values to society and so it has rules, regulations and doctrines – but the overarching thing about the church is that it must spread love.

'How do you show love to a person and at the same time uphold a different values - this is something parents face all the time with their children. We don't think parents should agree with everything their children want to do, they must uphold certain values but but most of all their children need to feel their love.'
