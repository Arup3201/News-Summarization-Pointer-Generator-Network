An Australian rugby league player has become the first player banned for inappropriate use of social media after a gay slur was posted on his Twitter account.

Grayson Goodwin, 24, was given a 26-week ban for the tweet 'Gay refs shouldn’t be allowed to ref because they r so s***' which appeared during an NRL game on March 21.

It appeared for only a few minutes, but was retweeted 30 times by followers, and followers of followers.

The ban has effectively ended any hope of the 24-year-old playing in the NRL ever again.

He admitted to it having ended his career.

'My career has been ruined and I can’t play at all,' the 24-year-old said.

Goodwin, who plays for lower-tier club the Cabramatta Two Blues, told the NSWRL a friend tweeted the message when he went to the toilet and he removed it when he returned.

It was posted during a game officiated by openly gay referee Matt Checcin and one in which his brother was involved in.

But NSWRL Officials did not accept the testimony of the unnamed friend, who appeared at a hearing telling them he was the one who posted the tweet.

Goodwin was later informed, via a letter, that he would not be eligible to return to the game until September 20.

He told NSWRL officials the tweet was only live for eight minutes before deleting it.

'I opened my account and saw the Tweet and deleted it straight away,' Goodwin told the Daily Telegraph.

Unprecedented: A friend of Goodwin admitted to posting the tweet but NSWRL officials still decided to suspend the player

'I told my mate off and I forgot all about it. The post was only up for eight minutes.'

The friend was a the hearing with Goodwin and took responsibility for the tweet.

“He stood up and told them what had happened,” Goodwin said.

In a bizarre twist, the Daily Telegraph reported that it was directed at openly homosexual referee Matt Checcin who used to baby sit Goodwin as a child.

He said it was 'ironic' that he had been given a career ending ban for a tweet about a man he has the utmost respect for.

Meanwhile Goodwin's ban is yet another sour note for the sport of rugby league after allegations of racism during a recent Under 20's State of Origin fixture.

NSW Half back Mitchell Moses was banned for two matches and ordered to undergo an anti-vilification education program after calling an Queensland opponent Luke Bateman a 'f...ing gay c...'.

NSW prop Matt Lodge received a two-match ban, after the word ''c---'' was found written on strapping tape.

He was ordered to remove the tape by NSW team officials.
