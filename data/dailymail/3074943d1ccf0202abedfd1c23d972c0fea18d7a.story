The Clasico will never be quite the same after Sunday night. Amid the flying challenges, the overload of passions, the bickering and the bad blood one man has kept his head while all those around him have been losing theirs – Xavi Hernandez.

But after 750 games for Barcelona it looks almost certain that after what will be his final Barcelona vs Real Madrid on Sunday the World Cup winner and brain of the greatest Barca in history will confirm he is off at the end of the season to play in Qatar.

Xavi has a contract until 2016 but could now play for Al-Sadd next season instead of the club he grew up supporting as a boy. The Al-Sadd offer includes a coaching role at Qatar’s Aspire Academy with the aim of playing a part in bringing through a bright generation of Qatar internationals.  

Xavi is approaching the end of his contract at Barcelona and will consider his future at the end of the season

The 34-year-old midfielder has been offered a coaching role with Qatar's Aspire Academy

However, newly formed MLS side New York City FC have also expressed an interest in signing the player 

The football world has always speculated over how good Xavi would be as a coach and these could be his first steps in finding out.

The director of the Aspire academy is former Spanish goalkeeper Roberto Olabe and Xavi, who has experience in organizing training camps in Spain, would work alongside him as well as continuing with his playing career. 

He also has an offer from Manchester City's New York franchise on the table and looks set to announce his decision after the Sunday's game.

If Xavi plays a part in Sunday’s showdown it will be his 29th La Liga Clasico. He has 12 wins, seven draws and nine defeats in that time scoring four goals. He pulled the strings in midfield when Barcelona regularly got the better of Real Madrid both before and after the arrival of Jose Mourinho. 

He played in perhaps the greatest Clasico for Barcleona when they beat Real Madrid 6-2 at the Santiago Bernabeu in 2008. And he was the epicenter of another devastating Barcelona display two years later when Mourinho lost his first Barca v Madrid 5-0 at the Nou Camp.

It was during the Mourinho era that tensions between the two clubs really came to a head and as the captain and long time friend of Real Madrid keeper Iker Casillas the two came together in reconciliation after a phone call from the goalkeeper to the midfielder that was not well received by Mourinho.

Xavi's Barca team-mates swamp the passing maestro after his goal against Real Madrid 

It was a lofted goal over Casillas's head in a Clasico in 2004 that was perhaps Xavi’s best individual moment from all his meetings with Real Madrid. 

That game was also his now boss Luis Enrique’s last Clasico. He was brought on in the second half at the Bernabeu with Real Madrid leading 1-0 and it was Xavi’s goal that won it for Barcelona four minutes from time from a move that he had started by playing a pass to Ronaldinho. 

When the Brazilian clipped it over the top of Real’s defence Xavi finished past his pal and Barca took the spoils.

Regardless of who wins on Sunday, football will lose because, with an estimated television audience of 400m Xavi’s poise and perfect passing will be seen in the Clasico for the last time.
