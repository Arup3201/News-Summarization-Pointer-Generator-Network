One man made the discovery of a lifetime while out on a recent hike.

Jordan Liles, who currently lives in San Diego, California, was in Tennessee back in May 2013 when he decided to take some photos  during a trek through Great Smoky Mountains National Park.

Those photos turned out to be incredibly interesting when the young man managed to stumble across a seemingly forgotten town the woods.
