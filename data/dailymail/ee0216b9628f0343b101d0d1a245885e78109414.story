Supermodel Kate Moss is the star of Rimmel's new space-age beauty campaign - and, as always, she looks out of this world.

The 39-year-old showcases the British beauty brand's new collection for lips, nails and eyes.

With its shimmering special effects and fantastical finishes, the space age-style make-up has been designed to add a dramatic sparkle to your festive look and Kate shows us how to work the look to perfection.

Dressed in a fittingly festive sequinned gown, Kate rocks smoky metallic eyes, deep rouge lips and glittery nails for the campaign, which is titled Out Of This World Christmas 2013.

'Celebrated for her beauty and her remarkable career as a model, Kate Moss has consistently set the benchmark to which others aspire,' reads Rimmel's website.

London-born Kate, who was spotted at JFK at the age of 14 and is one of the most iconic models of this century, started working with the company back in 2001.

In 2011 Kate created and launched her successful Kate Moss for Rimmel lipstick range, since followed up by a number of equally popular collections.

She's recently been joined by the likes of Georgia May Jagger and Rita Ora as brand ambassadors for Rimmel.

It has been a busy year for Kate, who has fronted campaigns for St. Tropez, posed on numerous glossy magazine covers and even designed a phone accessories collection for Carphone Warehouse.

Her most recent job saw her posing in American Vogue’s newly-released December issue in a spread set in Istanbul’s lush landscape.

array of designer outfits, often accompanied by English actor and 12 
Years a Slave star Chiwetel Ejiofor.

Tools: Apocalips lip lacquer across your lips, Space Dust nail polish, Glam’Eyes HD eyeshadow & ScandalEyes waterproof kohl

Apply dry shadow to the lid. Then, wet the applicator, dip in the same colour, and draw a line close to the upper lash line. You'll get a subtle contrast of shading that'll make you stand out.

To add a soft blurred effect, apply the gun metal grey eye shadow on the lower lash line using your fingertip.

Dab foundation onto the lips before applying the lacquer - this will help it last all night.
