Hot-headed Alec Baldwin has been arrested so many times, he needs to issue a press release even when he's not involved in a dispute.

The actor released a statement this week, following an arrest an at his apartment building in New York's Greenwich Village.

'In recent history, when the cops are called to 28 East 10th Street, you could likely guess it’s about one particular person,' Baldwin told the New York Times.

But this time it was Baldwin's neighbor Jaime McKeown, 56, who was arrested on charges of hitting another tenant with a frying pan in a noise dispute.

Baldwin's housekeeper and personal assistant witnessed the dispute as they were taking an elevator down from his apartment.

The doors opened on the fifth floor, where they saw the assault taking place.

According to cops, McKeown beat and dragged the unidentified neighbor, who was then taken to the hospital.

McKeon allegedly 'struck the victim on her head with a metal drying man, causing her to fall to the floor, lose consciousness and suffer great swelling and substantial pain.'

Baldwin says other people in the building say the two tenants were fighting about noise in the victim's apartment.

'As a prosecutor would say, he was lying in wait, crouched down,' Baldwin said. 'And then he cracks the woman with a frying pan. What is that? He waited for her to show up and — Bam!'

Baldwin described the vitcim as a quiet and shy person who is 'nothing but a lovely woman' and McKeown as 'wound very tight'.

McKeown was arrested and charged with second-degree assault. He has not commented on the arrest.

Baldwin added that he thinks it might be best that his building install security cameras in case a similar incident happens again.

The actor's building, Devonshire House, has been the backdrop of many of his arrests - notably when he got into a fight with paprazzi who wanted to snap wife Hilaria with their new baby last year.
