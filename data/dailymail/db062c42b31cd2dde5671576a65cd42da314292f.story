England midfielder Fabian Delph will be out for two months after dislocating his shoulder in a freak training accident. 

The star of Aston Villa’s bright start to the season has been told he needs surgery to repair the damage caused when he fell awkwardly during a session on Tuesday.

Delph, 25, will miss England’s next Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia, the friendly in Scotland and nine Villa games.

The accident is untimely for Delph as the central midfielder has been in excellent form for club and country during the first few months of the season.

‘Nobody was near him when he did it,’ said Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert. ‘He fell on his shoulder and we need to get it checked out.’ 

It’s an extra problem for Lambert, who is already facing the potential loss of captain Ron Vlaar in January with Manchester United considering a bid.

The Dutch World Cup star is in the last year of his contract and Lambert says Villa are ‘doing everything’ to keep him in talks which could double his £25,000 a week wages.

Delph has also yet to sign a new deal, and Lambert said: ‘There will come a stage where I might go to (chairman Randy Lerner) and say, “That’s what they are looking for” and negotiate from there.’
