A dog lover has spent a staggering $35,000 (£22,000) searching for her much-loved pet after it ran away.

Janet Mihalyfi, of Georgetown, Washington, has racked up the sum over the past year as she has tried to bring home the Rottweiler mix called Havoc.

She has printed more than 10,000 fliers, hired a team of dogs to track his scent and set up several feeding stations, complete with cameras, to lure the animal - all to no avail.

She last saw him at 7am last November, when he shed his leash and bolted after a deer at Decarlia Reservoir.

She said: 'I can't give up. I love him too much. I guess I don't think it's extreme. I think if somebody lost their dog two weeks ago, they'd be doing all the things I'm doing.

She says as long as their are sightings, she will continue to search for havoc.

'My life's on hold, because I don't feel like I should give up,' she told WJLA.com

She treasures a picture of what she believes is Havoc, taken in January, by one of the cameras at a feeding station she set up at American University Park.

The dogs she hired have picked up his scent at numerous nearby parks.
