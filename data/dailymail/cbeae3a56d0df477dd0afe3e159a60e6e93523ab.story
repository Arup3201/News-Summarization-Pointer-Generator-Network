A burglar fleeing from an attempted raid on an 89-year-old widow's house died after his head was trapped under a wooden fence.

Local villain Stephen Pope, 34, died from a suspected 
broken neck after a heavy wooden panel crashed down on his throat as he 
crawled underneath a fence in Waltham Abbey, Essex.

The accident is understood to have happened moments after the man was confronted by widow Ilonka Simon, who spotted him in her back garden.

A pillowcase full of valuables from the house was found next to the body

An ambulance crew rushed to the scene of the tragedy in Waltham Abbey, Essex on Thursday lunchtime, but the man was pronounced dead shortly afterwards.

The man, who was found in an alleyway off Mason Way, Waltham Abbey, is understood to have had a heart attack.

After he was removed from the pathway, police cordoned off the area and forensic experts spent some time examining the scene.

An Essex Police spokesman said a post mortem to establish how the man died was taking place today.

'Police officers are investigating the circumstances leading up to his death and a scene guard is in place.'

Two other men were arrested nearby after the incident on suspicion of committing burglary. They were being held in custody.

Neighbour Pauline Wright, 68, said she and her husband Donald had been shocked after hearing of the incident.

'We only moved here just before Christmas, ' she said. 'We came from Ponders End because we thought it was getting a bit dodgy round there.

'We wanted to move somewhere nice and quiet.'

Another resident, Angela Cairns, 45, who has lived in the town for 18 years, added: 'I was up that alleyway yesterday to pick up my dry cleaning. I am shocked.

'I always keep the door locked, but it is normally quiet around here.'
