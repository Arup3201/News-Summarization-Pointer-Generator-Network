An unlicensed motorist whose careless driving caused the death of his partner has had his curfew order lifted to allow him to go on holiday.

Derek Knight, 68, was handed a nine-month sentence suspended for two years and awarded a three-month curfew order after he was found guilty at Truro Crown Court  last week of causing the death of his partner Wendy Buttery by careless driving.

But Mrs Buttery's family
have been left furious after a judge decided to temporarily waive the curfew order to enable Knight to visit Bournemouth during 
Christmas week.

Derek Knight, right, who killed his partner of 20 years Wendy Buttery in a car crash on June 4 last year has been told he can go on holiday to Bournemouth after a judge lifted a curfew order handed to him

Knight, from St Ewe, Cornwall, who has never held a driving licence, lost control of his car and veered sharply off the road on June 4 last year.

He collided head-on with a tree and 
Mrs Buttery, his partner of 20 years, died at the scene on the A39 
in Trispen, Cornwall.

Knight said he had been driving 'all his life' in 42 different countries but there was no evidence of any licence records.

After the order was imposed the judge 
agreed to suspend it between December 18 and December 23 to fit in with a
£99 holiday Knight has booked to the seaside resort.

Knight had already booked a £99 holiday to the seaside resort of Bournemouth

Mrs Buttery’s family said the decision had compounded the anger they already felt about the sentence he had been given.

anger they already felt about the sentence he had been given

Her step-daughter Maria White, 54, said: 'At the end of the day he has taken the mickey out of the court.

'My poor stepmother did not deserve this. I feel like he has been able to get away with it.

'A
nine-month suspended sentence is nothing. Then to add the curfew but 
allow him to go on holiday during it doesn’t make any sense.'

During his court case Knight was told Mrs Buttery died because of an 'appalling piece of driving'.

Knight denied the charge of death by careless driving. He told the
jury a piece of cardboard fell from the dashboard and obstructed his 
pedals, causing the engine to rev and preventing him from braking.

But forensic examinations found nothing that would have affected the controls.

Prosecutor
Philip Lee said Knight threw 'explanations in the air like confetti in 
the hope they would land in the right place' and branded his version of events as 'invention'.

After the verdict, Judge Graham 
Cottle told the court: 'Anytime he got into that vehicle, or any other 
vehicle, he was committing a crime.

'I don’t think he should drive again quite frankly.'

The judge said Knight had not shown ‘any kind of remorse’ for Mrs Buttery’s death.

He said: 'If you kill your partner of 25 years by a piece of driving that is pretty poor. Don’t you feel sorry for that?'

Maria White, one of Mrs Buttery's four stepdaughters, said: 'As the judge said he showed no remorse and that’s what hurts.

'He could not even say "I’m sorry I killed her".'
