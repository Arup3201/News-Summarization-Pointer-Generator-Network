Prince William enjoyed an emotional reunion with his wife after flying back into the UK this morning following six weeks in the Falklands.

The Duchess of Cambridge drove herself to RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire to meet her husband as soon as he touched down at around 4am.

It is understood the reunited couple headed for their London home in the grounds of Kensington Palace, afterwards.

Sea King pilot William, 29, has been on deployment in the South Atlantic with his RAF Search and Rescue crew.

His routine posting proved 
controversial in the run up to the 30th anniversary of the Falkland 
Islands conflict, with the Argentinian Government accusing the UK of 
using the prince’s presence to inflame tension between the two 
countries.

The second in line to the throne’s 
posting is the longest that the couple, who married last April after 
seven years as a couple, have been apart.

William will now take a brief period of leave with his wife before resuming his duties at RAF Valley on Anglesey, North Wales.

A source added: ‘The Duchess met the prince on arrival Brize Norton. She wouldn’t have missed it for the world.’

While her husband was away, Kate marked her first Valentine's Day as a married woman by visiting a children's hospital. But despite not being able to see William, the Prince was still able to send a bouquet of flowers from 8,000 miles away.

The Duchess of Cambridge admitted she was missing her husband 'terribly' while he was away.

Prime Minister David Cameron and Argentine President Cristina Kirchner have traded barbs in the lead-up to the 30th anniversary of the invasion of the Falklands on April 2.

Argentinean fury: Demonstrators march past a Harrods store in Buenos Aires as they protest against the arrival of Prince William in the Falklands

Argentina has accused the UK of 
'militarising' the dispute by reportedly sending a submarine carrying 
nuclear weapons to the South Atlantic, something that Britain has not 
confirmed.

Buenos Aires also objected to the 
Duke's posting to the Falklands and the deployment to the region of one 
of the Royal Navy's most modern destroyers, HMS Dauntless.

In turn, Britain insists its 
movements of troops and warships are purely routine, and claims 
Argentina is trying to impose an 'economic blockade' on the Falklands by
restricting shipping to and from the islands.

Over the coming days the Duke, 29, is
expected to spend time with his wife and other members of the Royal 
family before he returns to Wales.

Flight Lieutenant Wales was part of a four-man team on call for search and rescue missions in the Falklands.

Islanders say William briefly visited
the local hospital, and made a trip to remote Sea Lion island, a 
paradise for penguins, sea lions, elephant seals.

The Prince was first deployed on February 1.

Speech: The Duchess of Cambridge visits Treehouse, part of the East Anglia's Children's Hospices where she delivered a speech to the organisation on Monday before Prince William returned to Britain today

While William was away, the Duchess of Cambridge performed her first public engagement without her husband at her side.

She attended a private viewing of a 
new exhibition of portraits by the late Lucian Freud at the National 
Portrait Gallery in London, of which she recently became royal patron.

And on Monday she gave her first 
public address - speaking at The Treehouse children's hospice in 
Ipswich, Suffolk, wearing a £139 dress her mother borrowed to wear to Ascot in 2010.

A spokeswoman for Clarence House confirmed that the Duke of Cambridge was back in Britain.

She said: 'Prince William arrived 
back in Britain this morning at the end of his deployment in the 
Falkland Islands as part of a four-man search and rescue crew.

'He is now going to be on a brief period of leave before resuming his duties at RAF Valley in Anglesey.'
