Killer: Joanna Dennehy pleaded guilty to murdering three men before dumping their bodies in ditches

A woman grinned at the Old Bailey yesterday as she admitted murdering three men and attempting to kill two others.

Joanna Dennehy, 30, stabbed to death her landlord Kevin Lee, 48, and her two housemates Lukasz Slaboszewski, 31, and John Chapman, 56, before dumping their bodies in two separate ditches.

The killings occurred after Mr Lee served an eviction notice on Dennehy and her two housemates.

Last night, Dennehy’s horrified family told the Mail she had the perfect middle class upbringing in the Home Counties before she ran away from home as a teenager and got in with the wrong crowd.

They said they had ‘no way to cope’ with the reality that their ‘bright’ girl who excelled at school had turned into a triple killer.

Dennehy’s sister Maria, 29, said her parents Kevin, 56, and Kathleen, 51, have had no contact with Dennehy since she was a teenager but her mother had been devastated by news of her crimes.

She said: ‘It has ruined my mum completely. If you can imagine being a mother and giving birth to someone who causes a family so much hurt. It is indescribable how she is feeling.

‘My mother has not been able to cope, from one day to the next the only thing she ever talks about is the families that Joanna has caused this to. I hope justice is served correctly and brings peace to these poor families she has devastated.’

Dennehy, who had been due to stand trial for the killings in January, stunned the court when she pleaded guilty to the murders.

In extraordinary scenes, her barrister
 asked the judge if he could have more time with his client for her to 
consider her admissions, but Dennehy insisted: ‘I have pleaded guilty 
and that’s it.’ She also admitted ‘preventing the lawful and decent 
burial’ of all three men and the attempted murders of Robin Bereza and 
John Rogers.

Nigel Lickley QC said: ‘The course is not one I had anticipated. We ask for more time given what has just occurred.’

The case was briefly adjourned before 
Mr Lickley told the judge that he planned to see his client this week 
before informing the court next Monday whether the pleas would be 
maintained or changed.

But Dennehy shouted from the dock: 
‘I’m not coming back down here again just to say the same stuff. It’s a 
long way to come to say the same thing I have just said.’

Mr Justice Sweeney said: ‘She has 
pleaded guilty to a large number of counts, clearly intentionally, and 
in the circumstances if there is to be any application for a change than
 I will consider it but otherwise she has pleaded guilty.’

Police launched an appeal to find 
Dennehy, who has a green star tattoo on her right cheek, following the 
murders and urged the public not to approach her.

Mr Slaboszewski, who was stabbed in 
the heart, was murdered between March 19 and Good Friday, March 29. Mr 
Lee, who died from stab wounds to the chest, and Mr Chapman, who was 
stabbed in the neck and chest, were both killed on Good Friday.

Mr Lee’s body was found in a ditch in 
Newborough, Cambridgeshire, on Easter Saturday before the two other 
victims were found a short distance away at Thorney Dyke four days 
later.

It is understood that Mr Lee had served an eviction notice on the shared house in Peterborough.

At the time of the murders, Toni 
Roberts, 25, who used to live there, said the tenants had been ordered 
out so it could be renovated.

Investigation: Police searching the scene at Thormey Dyke where two bodies were found in a ditch

Scene: Police were called in April to Fenland field in Thorney, near Peterborough, after a member of the public stumbled across the bodies of Mr Slaboszewski and Mr Chapman

A neighbour said the housemates were told they must go by April 25.

Maria Dennehy told how her ‘very 
clever’ sister, who attended a comprehensive school, had a good 
upbringing, with their parents paying for private tuition and music 
lessons. But at the age of 15, she became involved with drugs and left 
the family’s £315,000 four-bedroom home in St Albans, Hertfordshire.

Case: Dennehy's partner, 7ft 3in tall Gary Stretch, 57, denied the two attempted murders and helping her to dump the bodies

Miss Dennehy, a former signaller in 
the Army who also worked for Nato, said: ‘She was my sister but I 
haven’t seen her for many years... she left us a long time ago. I was 
only 13. She was getting into the wrong crowd at school and she decided 
to leave our home.

‘By the time we found her it was too 
late, she was 16 years old and had the right to choose not to come home.
 I have heard many stories.  She was in the wrong crowd, getting upset 
and things with drugs.’ Miss Dennehy said her sister had not always been
 troubled. She said: ‘No she was fantastic, great at school. We went to 
different clubs, she was always into music.

‘She was very clever, I wouldn’t say 
she was the brightest in the class but we had extra tuition as kids to 
help us with our studies.’

A former neighbour of the family, who 
didn’t want to be named, said of Dennehy: ‘When she was getting near 
school-leaving age she met a boyfriend and it started there.

‘She ran away from home and turned to prostitution.’

A neighbour at another former home of 
the family in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, said in recent years the parents 
had not acknowledged they had two daughters. He said: ‘I would never 
have known they had two daughters as they specifically said they had 
one. I spoke to Maria now and then when she was back but she never 
mentioned a sister.’

Dennehy appeared in court alongside 
her boyfriend Gary Richards, who denied three charges of preventing 
burial and the two attempted murders.

Richards, who is 7ft 3in tall, is also known as Gary Stretch.

Two other defendants appeared by 
videolink. Leslie Layton, 36, pleaded not guilty to perverting the 
course of justice at an earlier hearing, while Robert Moore, 55, denied 
assisting an offender.
