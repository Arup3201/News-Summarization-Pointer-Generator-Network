Following a botched execution earlier this year, prison officials inside Oklahoma Penitentiary have unveiled a rennovated death chamber they say will be ready for the state's next scheduled execution in November.

The $71,000 reconstruction of the death chamber and adjacent witness rooms gives executioners more space in which to operate.

Department of Corrections also spent about $34,000 on new medical equipment, including $12,500 for a surgical table and $6,000 for an ultrasound machine to help locate veins.

The overhaul follows the bungled April 29 execution of Clayton Lockett, who writhed and moaned before he was declared dead 43 minutes after his execution began.

Oklahoma's Department of Corrections spent $71,000 reconstructing the death chamber and an additional $34,000 on new medical equipment in an attempt to ensure lethal injections don't go awry

Capital Punishment: The changes include a larger 'chemical room' for the executioners to work from but a smaller witness gallery, allowing only five media representatives to witness executions, down from 12

Just in case: The new phone system has a direct line to the Governor's office, should any executions again go awry

A report issued on the incident in September blamed Lockett's flawed lethal injection on poor placement of intravenous lines, as the medical team could not find suitable veins in his arms, legs, neck and feet.

Botched death: The execution of Clayton Lockett was plagued with problems as a viable vein could not be found. Eventually, a line was inserted into his groin.

Ultimately, it was decided to insert the line into his groin. 

The execution was halted when prison officials noted the lethal injection drugs weren't being administered properly, with the doctor inside the death chamber reporting a single IV in Lockett's groin had became dislodged, and the lethal drugs were going into his tissue and leaking out of his body. 

This new device will make it easier for those administering injections to find viable veins.

New protocols require more training for the execution team and backup procedures in case a lethal injection goes awry.

Prison workers will begin training on the new protocols this week, and the agency will be prepared for the November 13 execution of Charles Warner, who was convicted of raping and killing his roommate's 11-month-old daughter in Oklahoma City in 1997, said prisons spokeswoman Terri Watkins.

'We will be ready,' Watkins said.

Lockett had been convicted of shooting Stephanie Nieman, 19, with a sawed-off shotgun and watching as two accomplices buried her alive in 1999.

She and a friend had walked in on the men robbing a home.

Based on the recommendations in the report, prison officials renovated the space to give the execution team in an adjacent 'chemical room' more space to operate.

They also installed new lighting and new audio and video equipment so the condemned inmate can be more closely monitored.

The renovations mean that only five media witnesses will now be able to witness an execution — down from 12 — prompting criticism from open government advocates.

'They took a process already corrupted by secrecy that had already led to at least one botched execution, and managed somehow to make it even more difficult for the people of Oklahoma and their representatives in the media to know anything about that process,' said Ryan Kiesel, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma.

ACLU Oklahoma, which opposes the death penalty, has sued prison officials who prevented witnesses from watching Lockett die by lowering the blinds during his execution.

Prison officials declined to discuss changes in the drug combinations used to execute inmates, citing pending litigation.

Twenty-one death row inmates are suing Oklahoma seeking to block their executions, arguing that by tinkering with lethal injection chemicals, the state is experimenting on them and violating the U.S. Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment.

The federal judge in that case expressed serious concerns earlier this month that the state would be ready to carry out three executions this fall.
