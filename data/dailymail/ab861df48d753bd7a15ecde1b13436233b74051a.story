Families crossing the Channel by Eurotunnel or ferry face Easter misery after ministers insisted on introducing new exit checks during one of the busiest getaways of the year.

Queues of up to five miles and lengthy delays are predicted when the new regime starts on April 8.

Under the new rules, the passport of every passenger in a car or coach will have to be individually scanned. Ministers insist that knowing who is leaving the country is vital for counting the number of immigrants in Britain and fighting crime and terrorism. 

Nightmare journeys: P&O Ferries has claimed new border control rules will cause huge delays leaving the country with 'coachloads of little old ladies  bearing the brunt'

But even though no checks have taken place over the past 17 years, the Home Office decided the best date to reinstate them should be on the second week in April – when vast numbers of Britons head to the continent during the Easter school break.

Ferry companies warn that holidaymakers will be held in queues on the A20 in Kent, blocking the route between Dover and Folkestone during one of the busiest times of year.

MPs on the home affairs select committee were sent a letter from the UK Chamber of Shipping claiming trials had shown that queues of at least 650 vehicles would form on busy days.

Tim Reardon, the chamber’s policy director, said: ‘The model showed that, with tourist and freight check-in transactions extended by exit checks, the queue of traffic heading for the port of Dover would extend at least 8km, blocking the A20 almost as far as Folkestone.’ Eurotunnel calculates the new system will quadruple the time taken to get vehicles onto shuttle trains.

Buses with 30 or more passengers on board will take even longer. Checking a car on to a cross-Channel train takes 15 seconds at the moment.

But passport checks on up to five passengers will stretch that closer to two minutes, adding to delays. Eurotunnel public affairs director John Keefe said: ‘You only have to multiply the number of people in each vehicle – five six or seven in a car or 30 or more in a coach – to see how this will play out. 

Protective measures: The checks start on April 8 and Eurotunnel and ferry companies will be checking the passports of all those leaving the country to tighten national security

‘That increases the risk of congestion and delays. That’s the risk we are trying to mitigate. But the risks are significant.’

Advice: Immigration Minister James Brokenshire told the Today programme that people should set out on their journeys earlier to avoid delays

Ministers were last night under pressure from MPs to make exceptions to the rules, such as large coach parties. Interviewed on BBC Radio Four’s Today programme yesterday, immigration minister James Brokenshire twice hesitated before saying passengers should set out early on their journeys.

Quizzed a third time, he said: ‘On busy days I think it is advisable for anyone to set out earlier to ensure that they are at their ports of departure on time.’

He denied there would be chaos, insisting: ‘There are often queues at both Eurotunnel and also Dover in terms of their day-to-day operations.’ In the event of huge queues, managers on the ground will not have the authority to relax the checks. They would have to seek personal approval from a minister or government official.

Transport bosses say the April 8 deadline has been imposed for political reasons so ministers can say they have exit checks in place before the general election.

The original date they had in mind was April 1 – just two days before Good Friday – but implementation was delayed by a week when the Home Office was warned the consequences would be even worse.

Despite the inconvenience caused by the checks, the Home Office will still not have a full picture of who is in the country. The checks do not apply to journeys to Ireland or travel by private aircraft or boats.

Airports are not likely to be hit by the checks. Heathrow said it did not anticipate ‘any disruption or any visible changes to passenger journeys’.

A spokesman for the hub said 96 per cent of flights already collect advance passenger information.
