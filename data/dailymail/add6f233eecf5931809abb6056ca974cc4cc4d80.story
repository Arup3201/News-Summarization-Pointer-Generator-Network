Working with my hands has always given me a deep satisfaction, and the physical, tactile skills of gardening are an essential part of its pleasure, regardless of which plants I'm growing.

For ten years in the 1980s my wife Sarah and I ran a jewellery company, designing all the pieces ourselves and, for the first few years before the business grew, making them all too.

Sarah had studied jewellery design but I had to learn on the job. One of my regrets is that I didn't maintain my silversmithing skills, because I loved working with that sublime metal.

Monty says that it's essential for us to preserve our ancient crafts before they die out

But I became swept up in the desk-based business of making a living rather than making objects. The truth is that the demands of a professional craft require absolute dedication. The half-hearted soon get found out.

Making things matters. We were once a nation that made everything from buttons to ships. Now we make hardly anything, and we are losing the sense of self-worth that comes with doing something well yourself.

This loss often extends to whole communities. But I believe many of us still have a hankering to learn the skills necessary to make things we can be proud of. I became convinced of this while filming a new series called Monty Don's Real Craft.

In it we follow three very skilled, keen amateurs in six different crafts on an intensive month-long course aimed at raising their skills to a professional level, culminating in a competition for a prestigious commercial commission.Â 

Stone mason, Brad Steele at work

The crafts in this series are blacksmithing, stonemasonry, weaving, pottery, furniture-making and glass-blowing. Each was led by a master craftsman who lived and worked with the trainees cheek by jowl, guiding and overseeing their work, acting as mentor, instructor and, at times, brutally harsh adjudicator of their efforts.

The results were fascinating. All the hopefuls were shocked to realise the gulf between the amateur and the working professional.

A prime example was when Aidan McEvoy - a Surrey-based cabinet maker who creates furniture of breathtaking quality for clients including the Royal Family - set his three trainees, Richard, 46, Jodie, 32, and Daniel, 30, the task of making a box in four hours.

They showed, I thought, remarkable skill and application, though none had finished when Aidan called time. One by one he picked their work apart. 'Look at this,' he said, peering at one of Jodie's dovetail joints.

'This relentless pursuit of excellence was ingrained into them all, in every craft, for 10-12 hours a day, seven days a week'

'This is half a millimetre out. There's a gap you could drive a car through.' It must be pointed out that this half-millimetre gap would be permanently hidden inside the box.

'But I know it's there,' said Aidan, 'and you know. And in 60 years that joint might give. When I make furniture I want someone to treasure it in at least 100 years' time.'

Within half an hour of arriving at the glass-blowing works in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, trainees Kira, 39, Bee, 24, and James, 24, were asked by master glass-blower Jim Adlington to make a pair of identical wine glasses.

I'd had a go at making a glass bowl and know that handling the molten glass is desperately tricky. They struggled bravely but for the most part hopelessly. Making just one good one was tough. Making two the same seemed impossible.

But, as Jim pointed out, people buy glasses in sets. There seemed to be a mountain for them to climb to even begin to achieve the standard expected.

Sam, 30, Stephane, 41, and Jo, 28, 
worked for days making mouldings to replace 500-year-old stones from 
Worcester Cathedral, thrilled their work would stand for centuries 
alongside medieval craftsmanship.

The
 results were astonishingly good. But not good enough, according to 
mentor Brad Steele. All three were rejected as unworthy to stand with 
the work of any of the masons who'd worked on the cathedral through the 
ages.

This relentless pursuit of excellence was ingrained into them all, in every craft, for 10-12 hours a day, seven days a week.

Trainee blacksmith, Sally, gets to work

They spent their days in a strange combination of mental and physical exhaustion, and exhilaration at getting expert tutelage in the thing they loved most. At any point they could have given up; a couple did. But most persevered, despite sometimes feeling hopelessly out of their depth.

Sally, 23 - a petite mother from Lancashire - had trained as a farrier, making and fitting shoes for horses, but broke her back in an accident.

This meant farriering - with its intense bursts of activity requiring great strength and awkward crouching to pick up hooves - was no longer possible. But she took to the steadier rhythms of blacksmithing - general metalwork using an anvil and hammer - with fierce determination despite desperately missing her baby daughter and constant pain from her injured back.

Likewise Joel, her fellow trainee, at 28 recovering from ME and at times looking dangerously exhausted, gave himself wholeheartedly to the hours of physical labour shaping the hot metal, eventually transforming himself as well as his skills.

It was hard. But for all of them, from the glassblowers making spectacular chandeliers for the hotel chain Hotel du Vin, to the weavers creating woven bags for smart menswear retailer Hackett and the potters making a porcelain tea service for the chic Goring hotel in London's Belgravia, it was a transformative experience.

Other than the two who decided to leave, all our trainees made scarcely believable improvements. Some will go on to new careers in their chosen crafts.

This series shows our hunger for excellence hasn't been blunted by modern consumerism. The crafts passed on through the centuries are still vital, and their mastery provides a life richer and more rewarding than anything money can buy.
