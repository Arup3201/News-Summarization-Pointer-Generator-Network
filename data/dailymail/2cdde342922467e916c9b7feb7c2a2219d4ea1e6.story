Travellers will be forced to prove they are actually travelling around the country under a new Government crackdown to stop them setting up camps on green belt land.

Under new plans, to be announced by the Government next month, travelling communities will be expected to prove that they have moved for two months every year.

The new draft planning rules state that 'for planning purposes the Government believes a traveller should be someone who travels'.

Under new plans, to be announced by the Government next month, travelling communities (pictured in Staffordshire) will be expected to prove that they have moved for two months every year and are 'nomadic'

It comes after Eric Pickles, Communities and Local Government Secretary, was found to have 'unlawfully discriminated' against gipsies by using his ministerial powers to decide personally whether they should be allowed to settle on green belt land.

The new regulations mean travellers will no longer be automatically banned from setting up camp on green belt land, although they must prove they have a 'nomadic' lifestyle.

The draft planning rules also state that 'travellers who have given up travelling permanently should be treated in the same way as the settled community, especially regarding sites in sensitive locations, such as in the green belt'.

Under current planning rules, councils must provide land to house traveller communities and the Housing Act 2004 also states that authorities must regularly carry out assessments of their accommodation needs.

Mr Pickles said the new regulations would allow a fairer planning system.

He told The Telegraph's Christopher Hope: 'The public want to see fair play in the planning system, with planning applications being decided on the basis of their effect on the environment, not who the applicant is.

'This Government will stand firm in allowing councils to safeguard the green belt which prevents urban sprawl and stops the open countryside being covered in concrete.'

Mr Pickles had said that travellers would be barred from settling on green belt land to prevent a re-run of battles such as the £7million eviction of Dale Farm (pictured) travellers. However, it's now been overturned

However, Joseph Jones, a spokesman for the Gipsy Council, disagreed. 

He told the newspaper: 'This is a very, very divisive issue – they are saying if you live on a gipsy site and you don't go travelling every year, you lose your gipsy status.'

He said travellers have 'always travelled for work' and said it is not a nomadic way of life.

Last year, Mr Pickles announced that travellers would be barred from settling on green belt land to prevent a re-run of battles such as the £7million eviction of the Dale Farm travellers.

He said he took action because his advice to councils to only allow green belt developments in 'very special circumstances' was not being followed.

Eric Pickles

Eric Pickles took matters into his own hands when travellers set their sights on his constituency.

As he saw 15 caravans turning off the motorway as he was driving home, he chased them down and confronted about 40 travellers after they pulled on to a cricket pitch in Mountnessing, Essex.

Unhappy with their answers, he then called in the police and local council to deal with them.

The group were eventually issued with a Section 61 eviction notice and told to leave the field.

After the incident in 2013, Mr Pickles said: ‘After seeing the trouble this has caused I’ve never felt it more important to protect our green belt land and the communities who live in and around it.’

The new rules were intended to prevent a repeat of the forcible clearance of Dale Farm, once the UK's largest traveller sites, on green belt land in Crays Hill, Essex.

It followed a 10-year legal wrangle with Basildon Council, which in 2011 mobilised hundreds of police and bailiffs to clear the site as the residents fought back.

However, earlier this week Mr Pickles and his department was found to have breached both human rights and equality laws for 'calling in' cases which would normally be considered by his planning inspectors.

In a ruling likely to affect many other travellers, Mr Justice Gilbart, sitting at the High Court in London, said Mr Pickles was operating a legally-flawed policy of 'recovering' for his own consideration appeals by travellers who claim there are exceptional circumstances for allowing them green belt sites.

No attempt had been made by Mr Pickles and his ministers to follow steps required by the 2010 Equality Act to avoid indirect discrimination, and 'substantial delays' had occurred in dealing with the appeals in violation of Article Six of the European Convention on Human Rights, the judge said.

The judge also said that Mr Pickles' department had 'coined and developed' a practice in 2013-2014 of calling in all, and then a majority, of green belt traveller cases - most involving Romany gipsies or Irish travellers - 'which discriminated unlawfully against a racial group'.

Following the ruling, Planning Minister Brandon Lewis said: 'This Government makes no apologies for seeking to safeguard green belt protection and trying to bring a sense of fair play to the planning system.

'The Government's planning policy is clear that both temporary and permanent traveller sites are inappropriate development in the green belt. Today's judgment does not question that principle.'

There are currently an estimated 300,000 gipsies and travellers in the UK. 

However, it is believed that only about 40 per cent regularly travel for two months or more every year, meaning many could be affected by the new planning rules.
