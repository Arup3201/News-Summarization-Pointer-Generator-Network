Max Clifford arrives at Southwark Crown Court this morning, where he denies 11 counts of indecent assault

Public relations guru Max Clifford was 'charming' and always acted with 'integrity', chat show host Des O'Connor has said.

The 82-year-old entertainer appeared at London's Southwark Crown Court, where Clifford is on trial for a string of alleged indecent assaults against seven girls and women.

O'Connor told the jury that Clifford, 71, was 'always pleasant and friendly' when he attended the filming of his Des O’Connor Tonight show.

O’Connor, who hosted the programme from 1977 to 2002, said Clifford would visit ITV's Teddington studios when one of his clients was appearing as a guest.

The pair first met in the 1980s and the publicist would often attend the show with comedian Freddie Starr, who was a regular guest, O’Connor said.

Asked whether he ever witnessed Clifford act unprofessionally, O'Connor replied: 'Never. I don’t think he would ever need to in any shape or form.

'He was just there to accompany his client if there was any problem.'

The Take Your Pick host told the court that Clifford was 'always pleasant, friendly - that was it'.

O'Connor said he became friends with the publicist after he and his wife were invited to charity functions around 20 years ago.

O'Connor said: 'It impressed me he cared. He was genuinely, genuinely concerned about the illnesses of the children.'

He told the court that Clifford was 'always pleasant, always charming', adding: 'I find it hard to imagine him being anything other than caring, concerned and generally good company.'

He added: 'I can’t imagine him being anything other than honest and with integrity. I always found him the man he appeared to be - pleasant, friendly, helpful, kind.'

Giving evidence at the trial today, Des O'Connor said he never saw Clifford act unprofessionally

Four times married father-of-five O'Connor, wearing a dark suit, shirt and tie, said he had not had any dealings with Clifford's PR company.

'He's never booked me a date or got me any column inches in newspapers,' he said.

Richard Horwell QC, defending, asked O'Connor: 'When he attended your shows, have you ever known him to behave inappropriately with a woman? Or heard of any suggestion he behaved inappropriately with a woman?'

O'Connor firmly replied: 'No. Not at all, not at all.'

Professor Ray Powles, who worked at the Royal Marsden Hospital in west London, later told the court that Clifford arranged for boxing star Muhammad Ali to meet his patients.

In a statement read to the court, he said: 'This was a surprise visit. The effect it had on my patients was inspirational.'

The publicist also raised a 'significant amount' for the cancer-specialist hospital and arranged for the boyband Westlife and former Wimbledon tennis champion Pat Cash to visit the children's unit, Prof Powles said.

Clifford's first wife Elizabeth trigically died at the Sutton Marsden Hospital in 2003 after a nine-month battle with lung cancer.

After a series of claims about the length of Clifford's penis were made earlier in the trial, the jury were today given the results of a medical examination.

Richard Horwell QC, defending, told the jury that an agreed fact in the case was that a doctor had measured Clifford's penis at an 'average' length of five and a quarter inches.

The jury has previously heard claims that Clifford has a 'micro-penis' measuring two-and-a-half inches, while one woman told the court the publicist's manhood is 'enormous'.

Concluding the defence case, Mr Horwell said Dr Ann Coxon measured the celebrity agent's penis last month and it was 'within the average range' for a white male of Clifford’s age.

The jury then heard the closing speech of prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC, who said the alleged victims had 'no reason to lie'.

She asked the jury: 'Can you imagine what courage was needed to speak out against a man apparently courted by the famous and wealthy, with newspapers and media hanging on his every word?'

'A man confident enough in the witness box to laugh at his accusers.'

Ms Cottage pointed to the similar 'themes' of the allegations and said some of the women had spoken out 'long before Savile' and the resulting 'media furore'.

She said: 'These are not wannabes in the witness box. They're here to give evidence in a criminal trial.'

Ms Cottage said 'inconsistencies' about the size of Clifford's penis had been used by the defence to 'deflect' from important evidence.

'What was said about his penis and what he did with it is what's important, not the size,' Ms Cottage said.

She added: 'One person's version of normal is another person's version of small. He said it was tiny, that's what he said, he took it out and said 'look at this, it's tiny'.

'He said that to two completely unconnected women who have never met each other before.'

Ms Cottage said sex had taken 'centre stage' in Clifford's personal and professional life and told the jury that: 'In his words, "sex sells".'

The prosecutor said Clifford 'reluctantly agreed' in court to the description in his book of 'sex parties' he attended in the 1970s and 80s and admitted covering up orgies for others in his PR role.

She described Clifford as an 'arrogant character', adding: 'This patter, this daring, chancing patter is seen in allegation after allegation.

'He name drops. He does it all the time. He doesn't seem to notice and can't stop himself. In his evidence we got everyone from Simon Cowell to The Beatles. None have any relevance.

'But it is the defendant's way of re-enforcing his importance to his audience - whoever they may be.The police, you the jury, or the girls.'

She added: 'He is a man who courts danger. Who is excited by the very risk of being caught.'

Wearing a light grey blazer and striped shirt, Clifford, from Hersham in Surrey, listened from the dock with the aid of a hearing loop.

His daughter, Louise, who has appeared as a defence witness in the trial, sat in the public gallery.

Clifford, who the court heard has no previous convictions, denies all 11 counts of indecent assault. The trial was adjourned until tomorrow.
