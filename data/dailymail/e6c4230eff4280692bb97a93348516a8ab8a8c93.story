The retro roo has touched down on Australian soil.

It's the newest addition to the Qantas Airways fleet - the new Boeing 737-800 aircraft has landed in Sydney, proudly carrying a retro livery based on the original design from Qantas' B747s of the 1970s.

The Flying Kangaroo is hopeful the retro-themed design will trigger a positive response in a bid to boost customer loyalty and rebuild its brand after a tough year of the airline.

Qantas Airways CEO Alan Joyce joined past and present staff and executives and other guests to welcome the aircraft after it was given a water cannon salute from Air Services Australia.

'Seeing this brand new aircraft in classic livery inspires a real sense of pride in all that Qantas and its people have achieved,' Mr Joyce said.

'For 70 years this familiar kangaroo on the tail has represented not just our airline but also the best of Australia and a sense of home for those who have seen it at airports around the world.

'We are especially proud to name this aircraft after our friend and former CEO, James Strong.

'James was an exceptional leader and this aircraft represents his love of innovation and his respect for the past.'

James Strong was Qantas CEO from 1993 to 2001 and later served on the Qantas Board until his death in March 2013. His wife Jeanne-Claude and son Nicholas were at the hangar on Wednesday to christen the aircraft.

Mr Joyce acknowledged it was a difficult time in the aviation business but said 'the worst is over for us'.

The company reported a bottom line loss of $2.8 billion in August but has been working steadily on its $2 billion recovery scheme.

It comes after the national carrier announced its major overhaul, which included 5000 job cuts, ditch unprofitable international routes and cuts to its aircraft maintenance budget.

It has predicted a return to profitability in the first half of the financial year.

The aircraft will begin services across the Qantas domestic network from next week
