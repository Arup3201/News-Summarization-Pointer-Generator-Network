A former unpaid intern is suing CBS and David Letterman's WorldWide Pants production company for payment for her four months of unpaid work at Letterman's late-night show.

Mallory Musallam, 26, who interned at the show for four months between September and December 2008 accuses the defendants of violating minimum-wage and overtime laws.

Musallam filed the class action lawsuit in the New York Supreme Court on Thursday on behalf of every unpaid Late Show intern from the past six years.

Compensation: The NYU graduate claims the defendants violated violated New York minimum wage and overtime laws and wants wages, with interest, plus legal fees

According to documents obtained by Deadline, Musallam claims that the defendants intentionally minimized their labor costs by giving work to unpaid interns instead of hiring additional employees or paying regular staff overtime to do it.

Additionally, she charges that she typically worked more than 40 hours a week but did not receive any payment or vocational training in exchange.

According to an online resume for Musallam, at the Late Show she 'helped research celebrity guests, dubbed videos, worked on a telephone switchboard, acquired integral information for show content, and helped with any other research-related tasks.'

Denial: A CBS spokesman has said the network will 'vigorously defend against the claims' by Musallam

The lawsuit is seeking wages, with interest, and legal costs 'owed to Named Plaintiff and all similarly situated persons,' a group that the suit claims 'is believed to be in excess of 100 individuals.'

Musallam, who writes in her blog that she loves 'all things pink', Nicole Richie and 'muscular boys,' also has listed internships at Entertainment Tonight, The Insider and W magazine, but has only filed a suit against CBS.

The network says it will defend itself against Musallam's claims.

'This lawsuit is part of a nationwide trend of class action lawyers attacking internship opportunities provided by companies in the media and entertainment industry,' as CBS spokesman said.

'We pride ourselves on providing valuable internship experiences, and we take seriously all of our obligations under relevant labor and employment laws. We intend to vigorously defend against the claims.'
