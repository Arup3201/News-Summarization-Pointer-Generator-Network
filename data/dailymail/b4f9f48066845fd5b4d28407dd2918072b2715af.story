He's known for his love of skin tight denim. But Russell Brand was spotted hanging loose in a very baggy get-up as he stepped out with a lady friend.

In what could only be described as a white pair of harem pants teamed with leg warmers, Russell paraded his eccentric sartorial style while out for a coffee in West Hollywood.

Perhaps the comedian and actor was taking preventative action against revelations that skinny jeans could be bad for your health if you're a man.

Baggy trousers: Perhaps the comedian was taking preventative action against revelations that skinny jeans are bad for men's health

Experts revealed today that the number of men suffering painful testicular problems is on the rise because of tight jeans.

Doctors, including top TV doctor Hilary Jones, have reported an increase in injuries being caused by the jeans, which are favoured by celebrities like Russell Brand, Jude Law and Joey Essex.

The trendy denims are causing twisted testicles, bladder weakness and even urinary tract infections.

Low sperm count and fungal infections are also being put down to the tight-fitting jeans.

Dr Jones, who is working with TENA on a project to highlight the dangers, said: ‘I have seen several cases of men who have twisted their testicles due to wearing jeans that are far too tight.

‘My advice would be to make sure you leave plenty of room around the groin area and that your pants and trousers feel comfortable so you’re not being restricted in any way.

Tricky trends: Jude Law likes to stay trendy with tight jeans but he might also need to run to the toilet more often as tight-fitting jeans can put additional pressure on the bladder

‘Men who wear tight or ill-fitting 
trousers or underwear which is restrictive around the groin area could 
be damaging their health.

‘Wearing tight-fitting clothing over a
 prolonged period of time can lead to urinary tract infections leading 
to over-activity of the bladder - a type of bladder weakness as well as a
 low sperm count and fungal infections.

‘Please don’t put style before health.’

Twisted
 testicles occur when tight trousers prevent the spermatic cord from 
moving freely, meaning it twists and leads to testicular torsion which 
cuts off the blood supply requiring immediate surgery to prevent a 
gangrenous testicle.

Tight-fitting jeans around the groin area can put additional pressure on the bladder but can also lead to bacteria breeding and re-entering the body causing urinary tract infections.

This increases the need to urinate more frequently and can cause severe pain.

In study of 2,000 British men:

Dr Hilary’s warning comes as a study of 
2,000 British men conducted by TENA Men revealed one in 10 men have 
experienced an unpleasant side-effect as a result of wearing skinny 
jeans.

Of those men 
suffering from wearing skinny jeans, half had experienced groin 
discomfort, over a quarter had bladder troubles while one in five 
suffered a twisted testicle.

Worryingly,
 one in four regularly squeeze into jeans- with the biggest reasons 
given for enduring tightness being ‘to show I can still fit in them’ and
 ‘because they look good.’

In
 fact, three in 10 has suffered discomfort from tight jeans and forty 
per cent of men admit they sometimes sacrifice comfort over style.

One
 in seven British men regularly wear skinny jeans, but more than a third
 confess they don’t actually know their correct jean size.

And when it comes to picking jeans, just seven per cent described softness and comfort as an important factor.

Zoe Brimfield, TENA Men Brand Manager said: ‘With this survey we were keen to highlight that while men may like the look of tight-fitting jeans, it’s important that they are not compromising their health.

‘Wearing skinny or ill-fitting jeans can lead to bladder weakness as a longer-term consequence. Male bladder weakness is more common than people think, with 1 in 9 men in the UK currently experiencing some form of the condition.’

Sales executive James Coleman, 27, of Ealing, west London has suffered bladder issues from wearing tight jeans.

He said: ‘I bought my pair of skinny jeans because they were fashionable, I’d recently moved to London where every street feels like a catwalk so I wanted to look good.

‘My friends used to joke I looked like something out of the Wanted or One Direction but I didn’t take notice.

‘At first I didn’t really have a problem and felt good wearing them but a couple of colleagues did comment on the fact they were skin tight and made my legs look ridiculously long.

Sales executive James Coleman bought
 skinny jeans to 'look good' but found not only getting dressed was 
uncomfortable but that the jeans put pressure on his bladder, making him
 go to the toilet more frequently

‘I then noticed they felt uncomfortable to wear, especially when sat down and put pressure against my bladder and stomach.

‘I found myself going to the toilet more frequently than normal, which just became annoying.

‘I didn’t bother going to the doctors or anything because it’s not something you want to admit - and it never occurred to me that it may have been caused by my skinny jeans.

‘Since moving to London I cycle more and I decided to finally ditch the jeans after I split a seam on the tube after bending down to pick up my Oyster card.

‘And since reverting back to smarter, looser fitting jeans and trousers I’ve found the problem has gone away.’
