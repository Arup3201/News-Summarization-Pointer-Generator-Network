Manchester City continued their preparations for the Premier League game with Burnley on Saturday as players took part in a spinning session at the club's training ground. 

But they know it will be no easy task at Turf Moor and will be wary of Sean Dyche's side following the 2-2 draw at the Etihad Stadium back in December.

While City are desperate to make ground on league leaders Chelsea and close the five-point gap between first and second, Burnley will be motivated in the battle to retain their Premier League status.

Indeed, Burnley have frustrated a few of the bigger clubs this season, claiming points against City, Chelsea and Manchester United.

Manuel Pellegrini's men got themselves back to winning ways last time out with a 2-0 victory over Leicester, but Chelsea's position at the top is strengthened by the fact they have a game in hand. 

City cannot afford any more slip-ups in their Premier League run-in and will have to be on alert against a very direct Burnley side.
