Headteacher Peter Maddocks, who failed to attend an emergency public meeting about high levels of absent staff at his school in Dolgellau, Wales

A school has come under fire today after it was forced to hold an emergency meeting about high levels of absent staff - but when parents turned up, the headteacher was not there.

Governors at Ysgol y Gader school in Dolgellau, Gwynedd, Wales, agreed to the meeting after parents created a petition voicing concerns over staff absenteeism.

It also said they were alarmed about teaching and learning standards.

The meeting was due to be held last Wednesday at 7pm in the school hall.

However, headteacher Peter Maddocks was not present - with parents apparantly unaware he was not going to attend.

The council have confirmed that he was not at the meeting and is currently absent from work - but they did not explain why.

However, one parent at the 400-pupil school, who asked not to be named, said they have been told he is off sick.

They said: 'The meeting was a farce and now we have been told the headteacher is off sick. Someone needs to step in to sort this mess out.

'Ysgol y Gader used to be an excellent school, but parents don't know what's happening.'

Another angry parent said: 'The damage has already been done.'

It is not clear whether anyone else was present to represent the headteacher.

The parent petition handed to governors read:
 'We believe that the school is failing to provide suitably-qualified 
staff to cover lessons during long-term staff absences, which leads to a
 lack of consistence and rigour in the standard of teaching and 
learning.

'It also causes a lack of progress in pupils' learning.

'We are also concerned about the number of experienced staff who have recently left Ysgol y Gader, sometimes at short notice.'

The
 petition went on to say: 'Pupils regularly complain that they have not 
had a formal lesson and/or that lessons are poorly planned with a lack 
of continuity and progression.

'Pupils
 also regularly complain of being taught by classroom assistants, who 
are there to support the qualified teachers, not to shoulder the 
responsibility of delivering the lesson,

Parents began the petition following concerns over high levels of staff absence and teaching standards at the Ysgol y Gader School (pictured)

'This is unfair on the classroom assistant and unfair on the pupils.'

The
 governors' letter informing parents of the meeting said: 'Following a 
petition received from parents/guardians, a meeting between the school 
governors and parents will be held on Wednesday, 19 March, 2014 at 
7.00pm in the school hall.'

A Gwynedd Council spokesman said: 'We 
can confirm that Ysgol y Gader's headteacher was not present at the 
public meeting last week and that he is not at work at present.

'In the meantime, a member of staff has been designated as a headteacher-in-charge.'

Cllr Dyfrig Siencyn, chairman of governors at Ysgol y Gader said: 'The governing body recognises that there are concerns regarding staff absenteeism at Ysgol y Gader during the current academic year.

'As a school we are working with Gwynedd Council's education department and taking all possible steps to address the situation so that we ensure continuity of the pupils' education.'

Cllr Dyfrig Siencyn said after the three-hour meeting he was not in a position to make an additional statement.

Dewi
 Jones, Gwynedd Council head of education said: 'Gwynedd Council's 
Education Department works with all the county's schools to raise 
educational standards.

'In 
the case of Ysgol y Gader, education officers are working closely with 
the staff and governors to address the concerns that have been raised.'

Dear Parent/Guardian

Following a petition received from parents/guardians, a meeting between the school governors and parents will be held on:

Wednesday, 19 March, 2014 at 7.00pm in the school hall.

The agenda of the meeting will be to discuss the two following points only:

1. Staff absenteeism and staff turnover.

We believe the high levels of staff absenteeism in Ysgol Y Gader are having a detrimental impact on pupils' progress and achievement in their studies. We believe that the school is failing to provide consistance (sic) and rigour in the standard of teaching and learning. It also causes a lack of progress in pupils' learning. This is particular concern in the case of core subjects such as science and maths, but also in subjects such as music.

"We are also concerned about the number of experienced staff who have recently left Ysgol y Gader, sometimes at short notice. This was evident in the case of history where a member of staff left abruptly during the summer, which consequently meant a whole term of GCSE syllabus was delivered by a retired supply teacher. This adds weight to the strong anecdotal evidence to suggest there is a culture of overbearing management in the school, causing a serious issue with staff morale.

2. Monitoring of standards in teaching and learning.

We are concerned about the standards in teaching and learning in some subjects. Pupils regularly complain that they have not had a formal lesson and/or that lessons are poorly planned, with a lack of continuity and progression. Pupils also regularly complain of being taught by classroom assistants, who are there to support qualified teachers; not to shoulder the responsibility of delivering the lesson. This is unfair on the classroom assistant and unfair on the pupils.

In accordance with guidance no matters other than those raised in the petition can be discussed. Note also that discussion that may refer to individual members of staff, parents or pupils will not be allowed.

I look forward to a beneficial and positive meeting.

Yours sincerely,

Dyfrig Siencyn - Chairman
