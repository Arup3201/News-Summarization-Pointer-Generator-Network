It was, in a nutshell, all you need to know about cricket’s attitude to its ongoing fight against corruption. Proof, if any were needed, that the priorities of the world governing body towards the  biggest threat to the game’s health and credibility are totally and woefully wrong.

When David Richardson, who has remained invisible during his two-year reign as chief executive of the International Cricket Council, finally spoke about the latest crisis gripping the game late on Tuesday, his words were revealing.

This was not, as you might expect, recognition of the gravity of the issues enveloping Chris Cairns and Lou Vincent and a clear statement of the action that the ICC will soon take on the guilty players involved in match and spot fixing in numerous countries, including England.

Instead, Richardson’s ‘interview’ with 
his own employers - hardly Paxman-style interrogation, then - seemed 
intent solely on launching a ‘thorough investigation’ into how the 
testimony of New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum, revealed in 
Sportsmail by Ed Hawkins, came into the public domain.

Finally: ICC chief executive David Richardson has broken his silence on recent cricket corruption scandals

Priorities: Richardson is more intent on investigating how the testimony of Brendan McCullum was leaked than fighting this blight on the sport

No mention, you will notice, as to why the much-derided ICC anti-corruption unit have failed to land a significant conviction in 14 years. No mention about any positive action against those responsible for Vincent’s crimes.

Clearly, as far as Richardson is concerned, cricket supporters should not learn about the depth of corruption in the world game from information leaked to journalists. So let’s all shoot the messenger then, Mr Richardson, and give further ammunition to cynics who suspect the whole sordid business will be brushed under the carpet.

By Richardson’s logic, journalists like Hawkins, the leading authority on corruption in cricket, and Lawrence Booth, who revealed in December that New Zealanders Cairns, Vincent and Daryl Tuffey were being investigated by the ICC, should be hamstrung and the game will continue to give the appearance that it is wallowing in a mess of its own creating.

If it were not so serious it would be laughable. It is worth remembering that cricket has almost always had to rely on outside influences to sort out its mucky affairs rather than taking strong, clear, decisive action of its own.

Controversy: Lou Vincent admits being involved in plans to fix games and more names are expected to emerge

If it were not for the Indian police then Richardson’s old South Africa team-mate Hansie Cronje would never have been exposed as the calculating cheat that he was.

And if it were not for the defunct News of the World newspaper then it is almost certain that Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir would never have been held to account for the offences that led to them going to prison in England.

Even the conviction of Mervyn Westfield for spot fixing in county cricket came about only when his then Essex team-mate Tony Palladino bravely stepped forward to expose his friend rather than through detective work from the ICC.

If the authorities could be trusted to bring the guilty to account then there would be no need for leaks and no need for sports journalists to become involved in the most difficult story-gathering process in our profession.

Shoot the messenger: It took a newspaper investigation to lift the lid on offenses committed by former Pakistan cricket captain Salman Butt (right), who was convicted and jailed for match-fixing offences

But leaks happen for a reason and journalists need to be ever vigilant because administrators simply cannot be trusted to weed out the wrong-doers.

Those who run the game should spend less time being outraged about the morality of leaking and reassuring its ‘stakeholders’ and more time fretting about the fact that others feel the need to leak in the first place.

You are not the only one who is ‘deeply concerned’, Mr Richardson. The majority of us are deeply concerned about what you and your sorry organisation are doing about corruption in cricket. Only when proper convictions come can you start attacking those who seek to reveal the full extent of the sickening problem.

The Kia Oval may have been full on Tuesday but there are likely to be plenty of empty seats on Thursday - and at most grounds hosting Sri Lanka this early season.

The ECB will ignore attendances at their peril. Yes, England are coming off the back of the winter from hell and, yes, they are lacking, for now, the sort of star quality that Kevin Pietersen in his pomp could produce. But there is more to it.

Star power: Alastair Cook's side and their opponents Sri Lanka lack box office drawcards

The cost of watching England is high and there is simply too much international cricket. A consequence is that England have had to rest some of their best players, hence the public’s reluctance to commit to 50-over games before they are sure who’s playing.

It is not just on the field that English cricket may have become complacent before the Australian horror show.
