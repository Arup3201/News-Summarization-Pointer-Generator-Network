Australia’s national airline has been named the safest on the planet after a year when the world was captivated by a series of air tragedies and mysteries.

With a ‘fatality free record’ in the jet era, Qantas scored top marks out of nearly 450 carriers monitored by aviation safety review website AirlineRatings.com.

The Australian-based website ranked the rest of its top ten in alphabetical order, with British Airways, Gulf carriers Emirates and Etihad Airways, and Lufthansa finding a place on the list.

Air New Zealand, Cathay Pacific Airways, Taiwan’s EVA Air, Finnair and Singapore Airlines rounded out the top ten.

No major US legacy carrier managed to break into the top ten. However Alaska Airlines and JetBlue were included in a ranking of the world's safest budget carriers.

AirlineRatings.com singled out Qantas as the world’s safest airline because it ‘has amassed an extraordinary record of firsts in aviation safety and operations’ over its 94-year history and ‘is now accepted as the world’s most experienced airline’.

It said Qantas has been a leader in a number of areas, including the development of the flight data recorder and using satellite technology for automatic landings and real-time monitoring of its aircraft engines.

AirlineRatings.com also identified its ten safest budget airlines, with two British carriers – Luton-based Monarch Airlines and Manchester-based Thomas Cook – cracking the list.

Aer Lingus, Alaska Airlines, Icelandair, JetBlue, Jetstar, Kulula.com, TUI Fly and WestJet rounded out the top ten in alphabetical order.

Dublin-based Ryanair – Europe’s largest budget carrier - did not make the top ten.

The low-cost airlines that made the list were selected because each has passed the stringent International Air Transport Association Operational Safety Audit (IOSA), said AirlineRatings.com.

Of 449 airlines which were included in the study, 149 achieved the website’s seven-star safety ranking and almost 50 had just three stars or less.

Five airlines - Agni Air, Kam Air, Nepal Airlines, Scat and Tara Air- found themselves at the bottom of the list with just one star each.

The website, a joint initiative between The West Australian and Aerospace Technical Publications International, said its rating system is based on audits from the industry’s governing bodies and governments, plus an airline’s fatality record.

But the study is overshadowed by an awful 12 months for airline safety with some of the most tragic and bizarre incidents in modern history, as the report points out.

There were 21 fatal accidents last year – a record low at one for every 1.3 million flights – but the 986 fatalities were higher than the 10-year average largely due to two unprecedented tragedies involving Malaysia Airlines, which accounted for 537 deaths.

Despite those high-profile incidents – plus last month’s deadly crash of AirAsia flight QZ8501 - the report insists air travel is the safest method of transportation.

The world’s airlines carried a record 3.3 billion passengers on 27 million flights.

Fifty years ago there were a staggering 87 crashes, killing 1,597 people, when airlines carried only 141 million passengers – five per cent of today’s total, the report says.
