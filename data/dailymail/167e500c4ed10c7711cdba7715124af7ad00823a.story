The Obama administration has radical plans for a multi-billion dollar, decade-long study into the workings of human brain, it was revealed today.

According to The New York Times, the Brain Activity Map would be a collaboration between federal agencies, private foundations and leading scientists.

Advocates for the project hope that exhaustive research into the brain's neurons would 
produce insights that could be used to understand mental illness, help 
treat diseases like Parkinson's and even enable 
advances in artificial intelligence.

Others have criticized putting large amounts of money into just one project and claimed that the study lacks clear goals.

Details are not yet final but the huge study is expected to be mentioned in the president's budget proposal next month.

It still isn't known how much federal money will be needed or proposed for the project in straitened financial times.

A comprehensive map of brain activity has similar scope to the Human Genome Project, which recorded all the genes in human DNA and was completed in 2003 at a cost of $3.8 billion.

The brain map could certainly also end up costing billions of dollars.

The New York Times quoted scientists involved in its planning who hoped that federal 
financing would be more than $300 million a year - amounting to more than $3 billion over ten 
years.

In his State of the Union address last week, President Obama described brain research as an example of how the government should 'invest in the best ideas.'

'Today our scientists are mapping the human brain to unlock the answers to Alzheimer’s,' said Mr Obama.

'They’re developing drugs to regenerate 
damaged organs, devising new materials to make batteries 10 times more 
powerful. Now is not the time to gut these job-creating investments in 
science and innovation' the president said.

Obama also described how the Human Genome Project returned $140 to the economy for every $1 of investment in research.

The Times reported on a federal study on the impact of the project that suggested that it had returned $800 billion by 2010.

But there has also been criticism of the Brain Activity Map.

The Atlantic referenced several Twitter users who 'expressed concern about the feasibility of the Brain Activity Map's 
goals and wondered whether this is the best use of federal resources.'

Leslie Vosshall, a neurobiologist at Rockefeller University, tweeted: 'Baffled by the NIH Brain Activity Map Project. We don't understand the fly brain yet. How will this come to anything?'

Michael Eisen, a biologist at Berkeley, added: 'Someone has to go to congress and explain why basic research is so important, not pander to them with big science c**p.'

As reported by The Atlantic, Eisen worked on the DNA research project ENCODE and he has since argued against 'Big Science' research.

'The lesson I learned from ENCODE is that projects like ENCODE are not a good idea,' he wrote on his personal blog.

'I think it is now clear that big biology is not a boon for individual discovery-driven science. Ironically, and tragically, it is emerging as the greatest threat to its continued existence.'

The project would be on a similar scale to the Human Genome Project where scientists like Dr John Sulston, Director of the Sanger Centre near Cambridge (pictured) mapped every gene of human DNA
