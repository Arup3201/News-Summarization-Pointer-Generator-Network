For years, dieters have berated themselves for every bite of bread that has passed their lips.

But tucking into carbs could actually help us with our healthy eating plan thanks to a new loaf which claims to be 'revolutionary'.

Protein Bread, which has just launched in the UK, contains seven times as much protein as normal bread and the carb count is 3g lower per slice.

A dieter's dream? Protein Bread, which is made in Britain from wholemeal flour, took almost three years to develop

Protein Bread, which has just been launched in the UK and is made in Britain from wholemeal flour, took almost three years to develop with the formula going through more than 80 recipes before its manufacturers, Dr Zak's, deemed it good enough.

It is much denser than normal bread too.
One loaf weighs 850 grams - about three times heavier than sliced white
bread - yet its makers claim it tastes exactly like regular bread but 
without the excess carbs.

It includes more than 15 grams of wheat and pea protein in every slice - regular breads contain only around two grams of protein - which aims to make consumers feel fuller without feeling bloated.

The bread is high in Omega 3s too, so eating it claims to keeps you fuller for longer than conventional high fat bread.

And while there's no doubt it does the trick (see the review below), this is not a diet food for those avoiding carbs completely.

A piece of Warburtons wholemeal bread contains 16g of carbohydrates, for example, whereas a piece of Protein Bread contains 13.9g.

So while the balance of protein is in the favour of the fitness enthusiast, High Protein Bread is not intended as part of a carb-free plan.

The company who make the bread hope that it will be a hit with fitness fanatics because it allows them to enjoy toast and sandwiches while still maintaining a high protein diet – ideal for muscle gain.

A spokesman for MuscleFood.com, who created the bread, said: 'Everyone knows that a high protein, low carbohydrate diet is ideal for losing weight and building muscle and thousands of athletes and keep fit enthusiasts try to maintain this type of diet.

'But avoiding carbs isn’t easy, particularly bread. So we saw a gap in the market for a new kind of bread, one with a much lower carbohydrate content than normal bread and a much higher protein content.

'The best bit is it actually tastes like gorgeous bread, not cardboard but proper, freshly made bread.

'It is more expensive than high fat bread but you wouldn't compare the cost of a chocolate bar to a protein bar, so you shouldn't compare the cost of Protein Bread with high carb, high fat, low protein traditional bread.

'In fact, our Protein Bread is better value than Protein Shakes and Protein Bars on a per gram of protein basis.

'At the current offer price, just 18.6p per 10 gram of protein compared to £1.00 per 10 gram for Protein Bars and 71p for pre-mixed Protein Shakes.

'We have already been amazed by the demand for the product and we really think it could lead to a revolution in weight control.'

Tim Hart, Personal Trainer and Nutritionist (BSc Nutrition) at Reebok Sports Club, said: 'The protein bread does contain a much higher protein content than normal bread.

'This offers some advantages such as slowing down digestion time compared to wheat bread alone, as well as providing an additional source of protein.

'However it is important to remember bread is not an unhealthy food and the £5 per loaf price tag means there are many cheaper ways to obtain a quality protein source.'

Celebrity nutritionist Patrick Holford added: 'Protein slows down the release of carbs effectively making this bread a source of "slow-releasing carbohydrates".

'The net effect should be feeling fuller for longer.

'The ideal sandwich combines protein with carbohydrate, plus lots of vegetables.

'Using this bread, being higher in protein, together with another source of protein, such as lean meat, fish, eggs or beans (e.g. hummus) plus lots of greens such as lettuce, watercress or spinach, would be an ideal lunch in terms of giving you sustained energy.'

Healthy option: A loaf of the bread weighs 850 grams - about three times heavier than white bread - yet makers claim it tastes exactly like regular bread

We immediately noted that the bread felt much heavier than a regular sliced loaf.

The packaging of bread was not exactly appealing - it focused on conveying nutritional information, which is no bad thing, but the way the blueish green tinge crept down the sides of the bag was a tad reminiscent of mould - never a good look when it comes to bread.

The bread itself tasted and felt dense and was firmer than a slice of normal bread, but also a touch more moist. It had a pleasant aroma to it - slightly sweet and nutty.

It had more depth of flavour than a regular sliced loaf, and seeds gave it a pleasant texture.

It left us feeling full and satisfied after just one slice.

We later tried it toasted and found the texture and flavour to be very good.

The bread kept its form and texture once toasted, even with oil drizzled over it. And it went very well with cheese, though maybe that is defeating the point!

The protein level is ideal for people on a high protein body-building diet - though with two slices adding up to almost 250 calories, this is not a low-cal option for those looking to lose weight (maybe we should have stuck to one slice?).

There's wheat flour in there as well as the pea protein and wheat protein - so you won't be cutting back on carbs entirely. But it is definitely a better option than regular sliced.

Overall, it's a better buy for those who adore bread but need to keep protein levels high (a regular slice has 2-4g of protein; this has 15g), or the casual healthy eater who loves bread but is keen to go for a product with a slightly lower carb count.

Unfortunately though, the £5 price tag is a big deterrent.
