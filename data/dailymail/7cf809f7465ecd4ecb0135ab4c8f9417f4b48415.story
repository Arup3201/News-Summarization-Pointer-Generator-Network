MATT LAWTON: Malky Mackay and Iain Moody investigated by FA over 'sexist, racist and homophobic' text messages during time at Cardiff 

Everton manager Roberto Martinez believes Malky Mackay deserves the chance to atone for his errors after being appointed as Wigan boss.

Mackay, who is the subject of an ongoing Football Association investigation into racist, sexist and homophobic text messages sent during his time at Cardiff, was installed as new Latics boss on Wednesday.

The Scot is the third manager to take the reins at the DW Stadium since Martinez left for Everton after overseeing the club's stunning FA Cup success in 2013.

Former Wigan boss Roberto Martinez wished Malky Mackay the very best of luck in his new role

Martinez, who spent four seasons with the Latics, said: 'If there is an investigation, until it is concluded, whatever the talk is, it is unnecessary.

'We all make mistakes and the opportunity now is for Wigan to get back into trying to win football games.

'Malky Mackay has a really good record on getting teams out of the Championship and finding success very quickly and I wish them the very best of luck.'

Mackay's appointment by the Sky Bet Championship strugglers has caused controversy with former Wigan striker and now anti-racism campaigner Jason Roberts among the most vocal critics.

'I would ask people to judge me when they see me. I've apologised for my mistakes I've studied diversity and that's something that's ongoing.

'It has been a difficult period and I have made mistakes. I hope that in my time at Wigan, the people of Wigan and the supporters see who I am and see that I'm someone that desperately wants the club to do well.' 

Wigan MP Lisa Nandy also wrote to club chairman Dave Whelan last week urging him not to appoint Mackay when it became apparent the 42-year-old was in contention.

Mackay has expressed remorse for his actions, which Sportsmail brought to light in August and cost him the chance of taking over at Crystal Place, and promised to cooperate with the FA's probe.

West Ham manager Sam Allardyce has no issues with the appointment.

Allardyce said: 'It's all around Dave Whelan and him speaking with Malky Mackay and thinking that he is the man for the job - full stop.

'If Dave Whelan thinks that he is the man given his track record as a football manager, then I don't see there should be a problem with that.'

Cardiff have not commented since Mackay's appointment by Wigan and do not intend to while he remains the subject of an investigation.

Current manager Russell Slade stuck to that line when asked about the matter at his latest press conference.

Slade said: 'The club are making no comment on that in view of the investigations that are ongoing. That's our take on that matter at the minute and I really don't want to make any comment on it.

'I knew I would get asked the question, of course I understand that. But it's not the club's business anyway, other than there are ongoing investigations.'

Cardiff are due to visit Wigan in the Championship on February 24.

'I will do things professionally, as I always do,' Slade said.

'Fkn chinkys. Fk it. There's enough dogs in Cardiff for us all to go around.'
