LaToya Jackson’s former husband, Jack Gordon, told TMZ that he once saw the king of pop punching the monkey.

In the past, those close to Jackson have claimed the chimpanzee was treated like a king, often sleeping in a crib in Jackson’s room with constant access to unlimited treats.

At his ranch, Bubbles was fed in the dining room and even had access to Jackson’s private toilet.

At his trial in 2005, jurors learned from a video ­interview with the singer that his chimpanzees would help him clean the house.

'They run around and help me clean the room. They help me dust and clean the windows,' he said.

When Jackson’s maids testified, they were not nearly so impressed by the state of the animals.

One housekeeper claimed that she had to clean up the droppings of one of the chimpanzees, after it decided to throw its waste at the bedroom wall.

Meanwhile, another maid described how messy chimp Max would tear off his nappy before crawling into Jacko’s bed.
