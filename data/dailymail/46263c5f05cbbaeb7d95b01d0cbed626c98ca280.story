When Caroline Barrett moved in with her boyfriend for 18 months before their wedding, she was only doing what millions of other young lovers do.

But for her, the consequences were rather costly.

Her grandmother, a staunch Catholic, had a ‘pious abhorrence’ of couples ‘living in sin’ and, after a bitter High Court battle, those traditional beliefs have been cited as a reason for Mrs Barrett being cut out of her £220,000 will.

The businesswoman – who has since 
married Alastair Barrett – was unaware that her Irish-born grandmother, 
who died in July 2010 at the age of 87, held such strong views about 
couples cohabiting.

The bitter family rift over whether 
Mrs Barrett should inherit any of Bridget Murray’s money came to a head 
in London’s High Court after a protracted dispute involving her aunt and
two uncles.

Mrs Barrett, of Basingstoke, 
Hampshire, was named as a beneficiary in her grandmother’s will, which 
she had drawn up months before she died.

But lawyers for Mrs Murray’s two sons, David and John Murray, and her daughter Catherine, asked a judge to ‘rectify’ the will.

A fourth child, Monica, died three 
years before the grandmother and it was her children, Mrs Barrett and 
her brother, David Robertson, who stood to gain a quarter share of the 
will – £27,500 each.

But that was before the other children
– their uncles and aunt – went to court to have them struck out. They 
argued that Mrs Murray had vowed she would never include Mrs Barrett in 
her will because she  ‘co-habited’ before getting married.

They further claimed that a clause in 
the will bequeathing Mrs Barrett a share of her £220,000 fortune had 
been a drafting ‘mistake’.

Judge Robert Miles QC, sitting at 
London’s High Court, ruled that the devout pensioner had not intended 
Mrs Barrett – or her brother David – to benefit from her will. Last 
night Mrs Barrett said: ‘I don’t want to speculate on the reason. The 
cohabitation issue could have been the reason – but it seems really 
harsh and she was not a harsh person. She was lovely.

‘We spoke about it and she was vaguely disapproving of it but like grandparents are with lots of things.

‘We were on good terms and I think it 
was more about financially looking at the whole family. It doesn’t make 
any sense that both me and my brother were cut out of the will.’  The 
judge accepted that some might view the elderly Mrs Murray’s attitude 
and views as ‘capricious’ and ‘not particularly fair’ as he ordered that
the will be rectified so Caroline and David were removed as 
beneficiaries.

Mrs Murray had always maintained her 
firm religious beliefs after leaving Ireland and was an active member of
the Catholic Council when she died.

A family rift developed after Mrs 
Murray’s surviving three children disputed the document, insisting that 
her ‘intentions differed from those expressed in the will’.

Mark Dubbery, representing Mrs 
Murray’s aunt and uncles, said she had not wanted Monica’s children to 
benefit and that they only did so due to an error in drafting.

Edward Hicks, for Caroline Barrett and
David Robertson, said Mrs Murray had no logical reason to exclude them 
and called the step ‘very unusual’. He added that he understood Mrs 
Murray had checked the will and was happy with the document.

However, 61-year-old David Murray told
the judge his mother’s religious feelings were so powerful she would 
never have been happy with her granddaughter benefiting from her will – 
primarily for having lived with a man ‘out of wedlock’. ‘If you talk 
about the Irish way of living ... people are struck out of wills all 
over because of religion,’ he explained.

Mrs Barrett married her partner Alastair in September 2008. They now run a solar panel firm from their Berkshire home.

Asked in court about her grandmother’s
attitude to her living with a man out of wedlock, Mrs Barrett said: ‘I 
wouldn’t ever say that she was stern about it.’

Deputy Judge Miles ordered that the 
will be rectified after ruling that the two grandchildren had only been 
named due to a clerical error which the court could correct.

The £220,000 estate will now be divided between Mrs Murray’s three surviving children.
