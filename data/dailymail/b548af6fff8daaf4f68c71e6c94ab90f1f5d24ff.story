An American woman who went on the run for six years rather than face jail over a fatal DUI has been linked to a second death - after allegedly treating a backpacker with an 'African potion' at a backstreet Thai clinic.

Kelly Lynn Miller, 36 - a former Alabama stripper and prostitute - was handed a five-year sentence for mowing down truck driver Donald Goodwin, 56, in 2004.

Miller was released on $50,000 appeal bond in 2009 but fled to Thailand, where she changed her name to Bea, switched from blonde to brunette and threw away her U.S. passport.

Brazen: Kelly Lynn Miller, a 36-year-old fugitive, was pictured topping up her lip gloss at a press conference after being hauled in front of the media following her six-year flight from justice in Thailand

Victim: Brodie Smith went to Thailand with his girlfreind Kara Spark to attempt to kick drugs. He died after taking ibogaine at a 'clinic' run by Victor Cracknell and Mike Picone, his mother and girlfriend said.

The fugitive, who gave birth to a baby boy while on the run, was finally captured this week and faces being deported to the U.S. to serve her original five-year jail term.

However Daily Mail Online can reveal she is also linked to another fatality involving a man who died after undergoing an experimental drug treatment at an unregistered Thai clinic.

Australian Brodie Smith, 33, checked into the Ibogaine Thailand retreat on Koh Phangan island to try to kick his methamphetamine addiction.

Miller – a former nanny with no formal medical training - is said to have worked there as an assistant to two American expats.

Victim: Miller killed Donald Goodwin, left, when she drunkenly smashed into his tractor-trailer in Alabama in 2004. Miller is pictured right in a mugshot from the time, when she was 26

All three have been accused of administering Smith with ibogaine, a dangerous herbal hallucinogen derived from an African tree.

The substance is used in tribal rituals in Gabon and neighboring states where many believe it can be successfully used to cure drug addiction.

However, the World Health Assembly warns that its psychoactive properties are highly dangerous, and users say it sends them into a dream-like psychedelic state.

Mr Smith's girlfriend Kara Spark, 26, says he stopped breathing shortly after taking his second dose along with another drug - thought to be Valium - during the $5,000 treatment last October.

The clinic has denied giving Mr Smith ibogaine, saying the backpacker from Mandurah, Western Australia, injected himself with an overdose of ‘illegal narcotics’.

Thailand's Ministry of Health took no action over the death - but Mr Smith's mother Diane Tucker has called on the Australian government to push for a proper inquiry.

She has also identified Miller as Bea - the glamorous female assistant to the retreat's principal operators, Mike Picone and Victor Cracknell, both from Buffalo, New York.

Mr Cracknell is believed to be the father of Miller’s baby boy, who was born two months ago on the island of Samui.

He told Thai authorities he had no idea she was a fugitive, according to the Phuketwan newspaper. 

Miller was finally snared on the remote island of Koh Lanta, off the coast of Thailand’s Krabi province, following a tip from the U.S. Embassy.

Drug clinic boss: Victor Cracknell was one of the two business partners running the Ibogaine 'clinic' where Brodie Smith died. Smith's mother says Kelly Lynn Miller was the woman at the clinic who called herself 'Bea'

Paradise lost: Miller was on the remote island of Koh Lanta when she was arrested by tourist police in Thailand on Tuesday. Above, a view of the island

Difference: This home in Helena, Alabama, is where Miller lived when the fatal 2004 crash took place

Thai media reported that at around 9am Tuesday local time, an officer with the Tourist Police approached her in the parking lot of a Koh Lanta guesthouse and asked to see her passport.

When she was unable to produce the document, the officer arrested her. The pretty fugitive was paraded in front of the press but appeared unconcerned by the media attention, casually reapplying lip-gloss as the cameras rolled.

Thai authorities suspect Miller's relatives in the US had been wiring money to help her make ends meet.

But Miller's mother Penney, 70, told Daily Mail Online she ‘laughed’ when she read about the accusations, adding: 'There's no money here to send her.'

Unmoved: Miller looked nonchalant, and rested her head in her hands as she stood flanked by police officers at a news conference in Phuket, Thailand

'All my dreams now become impossible': Kara Spark, from Mandurah Western Australia, was with her boyfriend Brodie Smith when he tried to 'cure' his drug addiction with ibogaine in Thailand, she said.

She went on: 'I only knew she was in Thailand because the U.S. Marshals told me. Other than that all I know is what I hear on the TV.

'She called me a few months back to say "Mom, I’m pregnant," that was the first time I'd heard from her since she left.

'Had I had a chance to speak to her sooner, of course I would have told her to come back and turn herself in.

'At least I know she's finally coming home.’

Another island: Ko Phangan island was where the unregistered clinic operated by Cracknell and Picone, both from Buffalo, NY, was operating when Brodie Smith died. A third woman there, Bea, has been identified by the dead man's mother as Miller, who was on the run from Alabama

Miller struck and killed Donald Goodwin while driving drunk on Interstate 459 near her home in Hoover, just south of Birmingham, in September 2004.

The Florida truck driver had pulled over in the emergency lane and was checking his tires when Miller hit his vehicle and careened into him.

Miller was due to go on trial in January 2007 on a charge of vehicular homicide but pleaded guilty. 

Mission: Dianne Tucker, the dead man's mother, is campaigning for a murder probe into her son's death. She identified Miller as 'Bea', the woman at the 'clinic' when he died 

She was set to report to prison but fled Alabama after making a $50,000 appeal bond and was officially declared a fugitive in 2010.

Probation papers describe her as a former nanny who left her $10-an-hour job to become a ‘self-employed entertainer’ making $4,000 a month.

But Daily Mail Online can reveal that the busty divorcee led a seedy double-life as an exotic dancer and prostitute.

A law enforcement source said: 'Kelly Miller is a very pretty girl from a good, upper-middle class family.

‘She's not stupid. She's entrepreneurial; she’s a survivor. She is a very good business person with an ability to manipulate men.

‘This business in Thailand fits exactly with the sort of person she is. She was never going to go over there to become a barrister or a newspaper reporter.

‘There’s no doubt she was working here as a prostitute. She probably carried on doing what she was good at in Thailand.’

Miller separated from her ex-husband Brett Street before her fatal DUI crash. Mr Street committed suicide in 2007 but his father Chris, 67, insisted his death had nothing to do with Miller and described her as a ‘pretty, sweet girl’.

Former neighbors in the quiet Hoover street where she lived before vanishing overnight remember her less fondly.

They told Daily Mail Online they suspected she used her three-bedroom, $350,000 home as a set for porn films.

Business: Mike Picone, of Buffalo, NY, was the other business partner in the Ibogaine Thailand Clinic where Brodie Smith went for treatment before he died. 

Boast: What Cracknell posted on Facebook about what happened at the clinic

One said: 'This isn't the sort of neighborhood where you expect to see a Mercedes Benz or a limo but they would be parked outside her house all weekend.

'I don't know for sure if they were doing porn but people would turn up in all sorts of costumes.

'We would see all women coming and going in cheerleader outfits. The girls were all cute and there were a lot of blondes.

'The men would wear leather trousers and there was even one we saw wearing military fatigues - it was all very entertaining.

According to her housemate she was obsessed with facial surgeries. 'She had certainly had her breasts done. They were very big - we called her Jugs.'

Quasi-scientific: Victor Cracknell posted these pictures on Facebook of his 'clinic'. It did not have a permanent location but operated from hotel rooms. The mother of an Australasian who died after attending the clinic says Kelly Lynn Miller was involved with it and Cracknell was the father of her baby 

Bill Veitch, the chief deputy district attorney who originally prosecuted Miller said she would likely have only served half of her five-year jail sentence for killing Mr Goodwin had she gone straight to prison.

With good behaviour he predicts Miller will now serve the full five years - thought probably not any more.

‘If she had stayed here she would have likely been out in less than three years,' he told Daily Mail Online.

‘Now she's got a two-month-old child, honestly I think her capture is a blessing for that child that can now grow up here and a normal life.

‘It really hurt Donald Goodwin’s family when she ran. They are just profoundly grateful to the U.S. Marshals for tracking her down.’ 

Root: Ibogaine is made from this root, of a plant found on the banks of a river in Nigeria. It is illegal in the United States and Australia and regarded as a severe health risk for its hallucinogenic effects
