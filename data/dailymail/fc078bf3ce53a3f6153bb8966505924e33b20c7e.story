Climbing someone's coat-tails may be a useful way for people to get a leg up in life, but one lizard has been caught taking the expression far too literally.

This cheeky reptile was photographed leaping a metre from the ground before clinging on to another lizard's tail and using it climb up on to a high branch.

IT worker Iwan Susanto captured pictures of the lizard's antics near his home in Tangerang, Indonesia.

Iwan, 32, said: These tree lizards are only about 10cm long but their tails are almost twice as long.

'They appeared to enjoy playing together and there was no confrontation when the lizard jumped up to join its friend.

'When it jumped, it grabbed the other lizard's tail and didn't let go for a little while - although it was just a metre off the ground.

'They are a very impressive species to watch and my favourite photo is the one where the lizard is hanging off the other's tail.

'Although I work in IT, I love photography and, in particular, taking photos of animals when they play together like this.'

Susanto said that after the grey lizard had climbed up on to the branch, the pair walked along together, carefully taking it in turns to move so as not to knock each-other off
