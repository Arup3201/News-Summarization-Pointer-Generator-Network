Smokers should consider inhaling less of each cigarette and stop lighting up at designated places such as at home or work, the health watchdog said today.

Nicotine patches and gum should also be prescribed to smokers to try and help them quit gradually.

Previously, smokers could only be prescribed nicotine replacement products if they were to go cold turkey and stop smoking completely.

But new draft guidance, from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice), suggests a new slower approach could be more effective.

Quitting: Patches, gum and other licensed products should be used to replace nicotine normally provided by smoking cigarettes, the draft guidance from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) says

Nice has provisionally recommended the use of nicotine-containing products to support smokers who want to cut down gradually before quitting, those who want to smoke less and those who want to stop smoking for a specific period of time, such as during the working day.

Healthcare professionals should also advise smokers that some nicotine-containing products - such as e-cigarettes - are not currently regulated by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and so their safety and quality cannot be guaranteed.

But smokers should be told these products are likely to be less harmful than cigarettes, Nice said.

The guidance also suggests tobacco retailers should display licensed nicotine-containing products in shops and supermarkets.

Professor Mike Kelly, director of the Nice Centre for Public Health Excellence, said: ‘Smoking tobacco is responsible for over 79,000 deaths in England each year and children’s vulnerability to second-hand smoke is well documented.

Kicking the habit: Nice has provisionally recommended the use of nicotine-containing products to support smokers who want to cut down gradually before quitting

‘If you are a smoker, quitting smoking is the best way to improve health, and quitting in one step is most likely to be successful. However some people - particularly those who are highly dependent on smoking - may not feel able or don’t want to do this.

'Methods such as “cutting down to quit” may appeal to people who feel unable to quit in one step'

‘Harm reduction approaches provide an alternative choice, and are more successful when used with licensed nicotine-containing products.

‘Methods such as “cutting down to quit” may appeal to people who feel unable to quit in one step.

‘“Smoking less” is an option for those who are not interested in quitting smoking, although the health benefits are not clear. However, for some people this can kick-start a gradual change in behaviour that eventually leads them to quit smoking.

The guidance suggests 'cutting down prior to quitting, by smoking fewer cigarettes or inhaling or smoking less of each cigarette, with or without the help of one or more licensed nicotine-containing products'.

It continues: ‘Among the provisional recommendations, this draft guidance says that health professionals should advise people who smoke and want to try cutting down to quit, or smoke less, that this is easier when using licensed nicotine-containing products.

‘Advisers should also reassure people that licensed nicotine-containing products are a safe and effective way of reducing the harm from cigarettes, and that nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products have been shown as safe for up to 5 years’ use.

'Smokers smoke for nicotine, and since tobacco smoke is by far the most harmful available source of nicotine, switching to alternatives as a short - or long-term substitute is the obvious healthier choice'

Professor John Britton, Royal College of Physicians tobacco advisory group

‘Whatever approach people wish to try, they should be advised that there are no circumstances when it is safer to smoke than to use NRT products and experts believe that lifetime use of NRT will be considerably less harmful than smoking.’

The draft guidance, which has now opened for public consultation, was welcomed by the Royal College of Physicians (RCP).

Professor John Britton, chair of the RCP tobacco advisory group, said: ‘Smokers smoke for nicotine, and since tobacco smoke is by far the most harmful available source of nicotine, switching to alternatives as a short - or long-term substitute is the obvious healthier choice.

‘We would encourage all smokers to take up the opportunities presented by this guidance, and if they can’t quit using nicotine altogether, to switch as much as they can to an alternative nicotine product.

‘This guidance has the potential to change millions of lives for the better. We commend it.’
