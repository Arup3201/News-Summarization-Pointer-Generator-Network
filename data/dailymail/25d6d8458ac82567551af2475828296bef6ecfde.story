West Ham, Stoke and Southampton are all considering a move for Livorno striker Paulinho, according to the Italian club's president.

Livorno were relegated from Serie A last season and are prepared to cash in on the Brazilian who scored 15 times in 35 appearances.

But the Barclays Premier League trio also face competition from Italian side Verona and two clubs in Dubai.

When clubs were monitoring the player in the January transfer window Livorno were holding out for at least £8million for him.

But club president Aldo Spinelli admits the asking price has now decreased, due to their relegation.

Spinelli told Tuttomercatoweb: 'Not only Verona are looking at the player. West Ham, Stoke City and Southampton are tracking him in the Premier League, while in Dubai two clubs are interested.

'As far as we are concerned, one club is as good as another. It’s up to him now, so he will decide the destination then we will reach an agreement on the economic aspects.

Unsure: Aldo Spinelli has admitted that due to relegation Paulinho's asking price has decreased

'Paulinho will return to Italy on Thursday, then he’ll decide on his future. In January, our assessment was 10 million euros, now the fee has decreased.'

Paulinho was born in Brazil, but also carries an Italian passport having joined Livorno in 2005.

The 28-year-old is yet to play for either national side although he featured in four matches for Brazil Under 20s as a teenager.
