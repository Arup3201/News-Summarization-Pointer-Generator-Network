Lord Lucan drowned himself in a small boat he scuppered in English Channel just a few hours after Sandra Rivett's grisly murder, his son has claimed today.

George Bingham, 45, believes his father took his own life in the Channel's icy waters after guzzling whisky and sleeping pills because he wanted to 'vanish forever'.

He is certain that his father was worried he was being framed for the nanny's brutal killing on November 7, 1974, and ended his life to protect his family.

Haunted by his past: Lord Lucan's son George, 
pictured a few years ago, left, and with his father before his 
disappearance in 1974, has spoken for the first time about what he 
thinks may have happened to him

Sandra Rivett, nanny to Lord Lucan's children, was found dead in Belgravia, London, in November 1974

Mr Bingham, who was seven at the time 
of the murder, dismisses claims the 7th Earl of Lucan fled to Africa, 
believing instead that his father committed suicide before dawn lifted 
the following morning.

'If you’re going to find him anywhere, it’s going to be the bottom of the English Channel,' Mr Bingham told the Mirror.

Lucan disappeared after 29-year-old 
Miss Rivett, his children's nanny, was bludgeoned to death and his wife 
Veronica battered around the head at their home in Belgravia, Central 
London.

Since the killing and the aristocrat's
disappearance, detectives have developed a theory that Lucan killed 
Miss Rivett by mistake, believing she was his wife with whom he was 
embroiled in divorce proceedings.

After the nanny was killed and Lady Lucan attacked, Lucan fled in a Ford Corsair borrowed from one of his gambling friends.

It was found abandoned at Newhaven on 
the Sussex coast. There were bloodstains on the front seat and a length 
of lead piping, wrapped in bandages, in the boot. That pipe matched a 
similar weapon found at the murder scene.

Friends and family of Lucan have said 
the missing Earl probably jumped from a ferry of some cliffs. Others 
have speculated that he fled the country and lived as a fugitive, with 
many suggesting he chose to move to South Africa to avoid justice.

But Mr Bingham has a different version of events which he claims to know is true.

On his way to the coast, Lucan had 
stopped in the dead of night at Susan Maxwell-Scott's house, to ask his 
friend for some sleeping pills.

Mr Bingham believes his father, a keen
sailor, would have then made for a small motor boat somewhere in 
Newhaven harbour to which he had access.

'He would have got on board with a 
bottle of whisky and some pills and taken it out to the 50 metre mark, 
the point where if you go down you’re not going to come back up again, 
but not so far out that you are in the shipping lane,' Mr Bingham told 
the Mirror.

'As the pills kicked in, he would have opened up the bottom of the boat and let the water in.'

Mr Bingham believes his father would 
have been unconscious by the time the boat began to sink. He believes 
hypothermia would have overcome the aristocrat before water even reached
his lungs.

A coroner, in the absence of the prime
suspect, declared in 1975 that Lucan had indeed killed Miss Rivett. Mr 
Bingham believes his father did not murder the pretty nanny, but added 
that he hoped he was partly culpable because it would make his 
disappearance easier to cope with.

Mr Bingham believes that his father would
not have absconded, leaving his children (which included sisters 
Camilla and Frances) behind without real reason. And that's why he hopes
his father did have some part to play in that tragic night's events.

The graphic nature of the killing and 
in particular the amount of blood that was found at the scene, leads 
Bingham to suspect that one or more parties were involved in the murder,
yet he does not entirely discount his father being one of them.

He does, however, disagree with the 
version of events according to his mother, with whom he no longer has 
contact with, believing that the state of her relationship with Lucan at
the time clouded her details of fact.

Lucan left two letters behind 
addressed to his brother in law William Shand Kydd, written on the night
of the murder. In these letters the tone is clear that he was not to 
return, giving details of his banking details and estate.

The second letter, in particular, is 
most interesting. In it, he refers to a 'fight' he broke up at the 
property, and that a man left following the assaults.

Mr Bingham told the Mirror he hopes 
that what his father wrote in the second letter was actually false and 
that his father was, in some way, involved.

No matter what his father's 
involvement, Mr Bingham says it is beyond doubt that his father killed 
himself and tells of his frustration that some still suggest he is alive
and in Africa.
