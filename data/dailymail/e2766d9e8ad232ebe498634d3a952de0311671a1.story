Three people were found shot dead in the Dallas area on Saturday in what police are calling a murder-suicide at the hands of a bitter ex-girlfriend.

Michelle Boyer, 45, was discovered dead in her car from a self-inflicted gun shot wound. She left behind a note that police say detailed the ghastly scene she'd left behind in nearby Murphy.

Police found the gunned down, partially clothed bodies of Boyer's 40-year-old ex Jonathan Masin and another woman, 38-year-old Amy Picchiotti.

A town in shock: Police in the quiet Dallas suburb of Murphy say their first murder in recent memory involved the slaying of Jonathan Masin, 40, and 38-year-old Amy Picchiotti at the hands of Masin's scorned ex-girlfriend

Boyer chose to kill herself while parked in front of the home of her ex-husband, reports WFAA.

Neighbors of Masin's heard what they believed were gunshots around 6:30am Saturday. Later that morning, the father of one of the victims made a call to police for a welfare check at Masin's home, leading to the discovery of the bodies.

'Found in two separate parts of the home, they were partially clothed and barefooted,' said police in Murphy, where city manager James Fisher would later note that he couldn't remember a murder of any kind in the quiet town, much less such a sensational slaying.

A few miles away in Dallas, Boyer's body was found in a parked car. She was dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound from the same caliber weapon as the one that killed Masin and Picchiotti.

She left a note behind that contained details of the murder scene.

Police stopped short of naming a motive outright, 'however, it has been confirmed that Boyer is the ex-girlfriend of Masin and it is the breakup that led to this murder-suicide,' read a police news release.
