Labour's public health spokesman Diane Abbott says there is a culture of 'sexting, slut-shaming and striptease' in British schools

Children are being seriously damaged by the ‘pornification’ of British culture, a senior Labour figure will warn today.

Shadow public health minister Diane 
Abbott will admit that the notion that overt, public displays of 
sexuality were ‘enlightened liberation’ was wrong – and has instead 
created a ‘prison’ for a generation of young women.

Following yesterday’s warning by the 
Prime Minister’s new childhood guru Claire Perry that parents must 
challenge children about their text and internet messages, Miss Abbott 
will agree there is a pernicious culture of ‘sexting, slut-shaming and 
striptease’ in British schools.

Parents are ‘struggling to cope’ and 
need help to block inappropriate content on the internet and mobile 
phones, she will say, adding:

‘We need to start a national conversation 
between parents and their children about sex, pornography and 
technology.

‘For so long, it’s been argued that 
overt, public displays of sexuality are an enlightened liberation. 

'But I
 believe that for many, the pressure of conforming to hypersexualisation
 and its pitfalls is a prison. And the permanence of social media and 
technology can be a life sentence.’’

The Labour frontbencher’s 
intervention, in a speech to the Fabian Women’s Network, suggests an 
emerging political consensus on the need for radical thinking on the 
commercialisation and sexualisation of childhood.

In yesterday’s Daily Mail, Mrs Perry, 
appointed by the Prime Minister as his adviser on the issue last month, 
set out a range of proposals including better systems for parents and 
children to report inappropriate behaviour online, restrictions on 
access to sexually explicit music videos and ‘lads’ mags’, and better 
teaching of internet safety in schools.

Most controversially, she insisted 
parents should challenge the culture of ‘children’s rights’ which 
suggests they should be able to communicate with friends and strangers 
online or by text in private.

Miss Abbott will today agree that parents must be put ‘back in control’. 

‘I want to highlight what I believe is
 the rise of a secret garden, striptease culture in British schools and 
society, which has been put beyond the control of British families by 
fast-developing technology, and an increasingly pornified British 
culture,’ she will say.

‘There’s something wrong with a 
society as a whole when children say they have no-one to turn to for 
advice because their parents – outwitted by technology, and struggling 
to juggle work and home life – don't really know what's going on.

‘There’s something wrong with a 
society when many young girls of all classes are pressurised into 
exposing themselves online, and are then humiliated.

‘There’s something wrong with a 
society when most children say their sex education is out-of-touch, 
irrelevant and too little too late. And where boys end up turning to 
hardcore online pornography to teach them what they think they need to 
know.

Many young girls are being forced to conform to hypersexualisation (picture posed by model)

‘There’s something wrong with a 
society that normalises children of every background “sexting” from 
their bedrooms. There’s something wrong with a society that sells 
T-shirts for little girls emblazoned with "future porn star", and when 
padded bras, thongs and high heeled shoes are marketed and sold to 
children.

‘There something wrong with a society 
that has gangs of disenfranchised young men who use rape and sexual 
assault as the weapon of choice.’

Miss Abbott will reject the idea that 
she is ‘hankering after some rose-tinted picture of childhood’. She will
 insist: ‘Do we really have to just accept things as they are?  As 
parents we're told - often by our own kids - that we've just got to live
 with it - that the world has changed.

'But I don’t think we should 
simply throw our hands up and accept the world – and the all-consuming 
market - as it is.  

‘We need to talk about how we put 
families, and not the lowest common denominator of the market, back in 
control.  We’ve got to build a society based on open-minded family 
values, and not ‘anything-goes’ market values.

‘Parents and teachers have a duty to 
ensure that children develop a healthy view of sexuality, distinct from 
this porn version that is swamping and infiltrating British life. 

'Because it’s a very specific form of sexuality that’s being imposed, on 
children and adults: a porn version. This is what kids are dealing with 
on a daily basis.

‘Young people are accessing far harder
 pornographic images than ten or 15 years ago. We have to ask, does that
 influence what they themselves put out on the internet?’

Miss Abbott will say that while most 
parents would not allow their children to watch an 18-rated film, they 
are often ‘powerless’ when it comes to what they access online and by 
mobile phone.

‘I think one of the symptoms of the 
culture that has grown is that young girls and women are subject to 
"slut shaming" and sexual bullying in schools.

‘It’s hypersexualized British culture 
in which women are objectified, objectify one another, and are 
encouraged to objectify themselves; where homophobic bullying is 
normalised; and young boys’ world view is shaped by hardcore American 
pornography and other dark corners of the internet,’ she will say.

David Cameron's new childhood guru, MP Claire Perry wants parents to ask their children about their text messages

Labour is calling for a ‘sex education
 revolution’ in schools – with lessons focused on ‘preparing young 
people to form healthy, respectful, emotionally fulfilling 
relationships’.

Miss Abbott will also say it must be ‘easier for parents to block adult and age-restricted material across all media’.

‘Internet users should have to make an
 active choice over whether they allow adult content or not. We must 
look at ‘child friendly’ computers and mobile phones where adult content
 is filtered out by default,’ she will say

Mrs Perry told the BBC’s Daily 
Politics: ‘Parents are feeling a powerlessness about their kids’ lives. 
When we were growing up, if someone was phoning our houses or sending 
letters to the home, parents would feel they had a responsibility to 
intervene.

‘Somehow we have kind of ceded that responsibility. We feel a nervousness about becoming involved in our kids’ online lives.

‘I’ve got three children – it’s not an
 easy thing to do. Of course children should have privacy in childhood, 
but we have exposed them to third party dangers and almost become 
complicit in that.

‘We are usually paying for these 
mobile phone contracts and devices. Haven’t we got a responsibility to 
monitor what’s going on? We need a return to common sense.’

Nick Pickles, director of the Big 
Brother Watch campaign group, insisted there was ‘total lack of 
evidence’ to support what he branded Mrs Perry’s ‘Mary Whitehouse 2.0 
campaign’.

‘Parenting is dependent on a 
relationship of trust, and spying only undermines the parent-child 
relationship. Whether reading a diary or reading a text message, privacy
 is not something to be brushed aside in a wave of hysteria and cheap 
headlines,’ he said.
