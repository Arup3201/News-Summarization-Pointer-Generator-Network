Former X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos has been charged with supplying class A drugs.

The 25-year-old singer, who issued a defiant statement that she is innocent, now faces trial over claims she arranged an £800 cocaine deal.

She was arrested in June after being secretly taped allegedly bragging that she could get cocaine for an undercover reporter in a national newspaper sting.

Charged: Tulisa Contostavlos, pictured in a recent social media picture, is accused of supplying Class A drugs

She is said to have put the reporter 
in contact with a friend, rapper Mike GLC, real name Michael Coombs, who
 is accused of selling half an ounce of cocaine worth £800 in a meeting 
at the Dorchester Hotel in central London.

Prosecutors announced yesterday that they had sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction.

Coombs, 35, has also been charged with supplying class A drugs. The pair will appear in court in London next week.

Last night the singer insisted she was innocent.

Miss
 Contostavlos’s lawyer Ben Rose said: ‘Tulisa has been charged with a 
serious criminal offence to which she will plead not guilty.

‘This entire case has been manufactured by The Sun On Sunday and Mazher Mahmood, sometimes known as the fake sheikh.

‘They
 spent a large amount of their readers’ money in flying Tulisa and a 
number of her friends first class to Las Vegas. There Mahmood posed as a
 film producer offering her a £3million film contract.’ 

‘In due course Tulisa will give a full answer to these allegations in court.’

A
 Sun spokesman defended the article, saying: ‘The Sun On Sunday’s 
investigation into Tulisa Contostavlos was entirely justified in the 
public interest.

Ms Contostavlos is a self-described role model for young people and therefore has certain responsibilities.

'Throughout
 our investigation, our team followed the Press Complaints Commission 
Code and then handed over our dossier of evidence to the police.

‘It is right that this matter  should go to court and be decided by a jury.

‘Allegations about the conduct of this newspaper made by Ms Contostavlos’ lawyers are entirely without foundation.’

Miss
 Contostavlos first found fame with hip-hop group N-Dubz and became a 
household name when she joined the X Factor judging panel.

A lawyer representing Contostavlos (pictured last month) said the entire case has been manufactured by the Sun on Sunday and she is the latest celebrity to be used as 'fodder by greedy newspapers'

She was dropped from the line-up just days before her arrest after earning £1million over her two years on the show.

The
 singer, who left school without any qualifications after a troubled 
childhood on a north London council estate, has claimed that she is an 
‘inspiration for Broken Britain’.

She also faces a separate police probe over claims she punched a showbiz blogger in the eye at V Festival in Essex this summer.

A
 spokesman for Essex Police said: ‘Two people attended voluntary 
interviews at Chelmsford Police station on Thursday, November 28. 
Inquiries are continuing.’
