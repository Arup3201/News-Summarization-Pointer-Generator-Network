A heartwarming video shows the moment a high school football team's waterboy makes his first touchdown.

Noah VanVooren, who has Down Syndrome, is a senior at Little Chute High School in Clintonville, Wisconsin, and is the Mustangs football team manager and waterboy, reports RadarOnline.

He led the team onto the pitch but then asked his coach, Brian Ryczkowski, if he could play in the third quarter of the match against the Clintonville Truckers.

With 1.2 seconds on the clock, Little Chute called time out and the crowd started chanting 'Noah, Noah!'.

Mr Ryczkowski said he wasn't sure if Mr VanVooren wanted to play and told his local paper, the Post Crescent, he thought he would be nervous.

But Mr VanVooren headed onto the field in the last second of the game wearing his number 14 shirt.

With encouraging high fives from his teammates, lined up on the field next to quarterback Sam Merryfield.

He was passed the ball from Merryfield and, with both teams supporting his run, he ran 35 yards past the Clintonville Truckers with the crowd cheering him on.

Mr VanVooren makes it to the end zone and throws the ball down to make his first touchdown and bring the score to 62-0.

'It was great seeing him out there,' Mustangs senior linebacker Max Keyzers said. 'He’s always been the motivator for our team. He talks after every game.

'It was great to hear the crowd chanting and it was great to get him the ball.'

After the touchdown, Mr VanVooren is swarmed by his friends. He then sang the school song with them and stood beside Mr Ryczkowski as he lead the postgame huddle.

Mr VanVooren is a regular at the school's football and basketball games.

'He’s always our biggest fan, so it’s always nice to see him,' said senior Tyler Zak, who ran for three touchdowns. 'He’s always there with us.'

The idea for Mr VanVooren’s touchdown came from a group of Little Chute seniors, who told an assistant coach.

From there, it got the approval of Clintonville and the game officials.

'A lot of credit for Clintonville for being a class act,' Mr Ryczkowski said.
