Actress and former porn star Traci Lords has revealed that she was raped as a child while growing up in Steubenville, Ohio.

The 44-year-old, who became an infamous teen porn actress, was just ten years old at the time of the sexual assault. She has spoken out in reaction to the current Ohio rape case which has thrust her hometown onto the national stage.

Speaking to Piers Morgan on Thursday, she revealed: ‘I was born in Steubenville, Ohio and I was raped in there. So was my mother. I think there’s a sickness in that city.’

Miss Lords went onto admit that she was initially reluctant to respond to fans’ tweets asking her to comment on the rape case in which two high school players stand accused of sexually assaulting an intoxicated 16-year-old girl.

She said: ‘People come after you and the last thing I wanted was the, “Look at this slut talking about that slut thing.” But I just couldn’t stay silent.’

The actress said watching the trial of Trent Mays, 16, and 17-year-old Ma’lik Richmond had ‘affected her so deeply’ and brought the experiences of her childhood back in vivid detail. Miss Lords' attacker was 14 years old.

She has written a song entitled Stupidville to channel the anger she 
felt at seeing images of the 16-year-old girl being ‘carried like a pig’.

Miss Lords added: ‘It’s what all the locals in Steubenville Ohio used to call Steubenville.’

She
characterized her hometown – a city that proudly boasts of her as its 
daughter along with its other musical claim to fame, Dean Martin – as a 
place where there is, ‘a lot of alcohol and a lack of regard for young 
women’.

Asked by Piers 
Morgan if young men are brought up to be disrespectful to young women in
the Ohio town, Lord responded simply. ‘I think so, yes. I do think so.’ 

High school football players Trent Mays, 16, and 17-year-old Ma’lik Richmond are accused of sexually assaulting a teenage girl in a case that has scandalized America.

Mays and Richmond allegedly twice digitally penetrated the girl - described as 'too impaired to say no' - and subjected her to 'degradation, humiliation and violation' including stripping her naked.

Traci Lords was born Nora Louise Kuzma on May 7, 1968 in Steubenville, Ohio to parents Louis and Patricia.

At just ten years old, she was raped by a teenage boy in the town.

Traci
fled her violent, alcoholic father with her mother and three sisters 
when she was 12 years old, moving to Lawndale, California.

She
was molested by her mother's cocaine-dealing new boyfriend Roger. At 
the age of 15, she dropped out of high school to move in with him after 
he split up with her mother.

Roger arranged Traci's first nude photo shoot, posing as her stepfather. She began working as a porn actress using a fake driver's license that said she was 20 years old. 

Lords quickly became an adult movie star
around the time of her 16th birthday. She starred in films  What Gets 
Me Hot!, followed by Those Young Girls and Talk Dirty To Me Part III. By
the time she was 18, she had starred in 100 adult films. She also posed
for porn magazines including Penthouse.

Shortly after her 18th birthday in 1986, Lords was busted by the FBI for being an underage porn star.

The investigation cost the adult film industry millions of dollars as they had to destroy thousands of her tape and magazines or face charges of trafficking in child pornography.

The FBI say that Lords was an underage victim of an exploitative porn industry which forced her to do drugs. However some adult film stars including Ron Jeremy claim that Lords was aware of what she was doing and they never witnessed her using drugs.

Lords was never charged with a crime and began to reinvent herself, away from the porn industry. She diversified her career becoming a TV and B-Movie actress.

She most famously starred opposite Johnny Depp in the John Waters film Cry Baby.

More recently, she has appeared in several popular mainstream films including 'Zack and Miri Make a Porno' starring Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks.

Lords is also successful in the music industry working with British bands the Manic Street Preachers and Jesus Jones.

She wrote a memoir, which made the New York Times bestsellers' list, on her troubled upbringing and infamous porn career called Traci Lords: Underneath It All.

She married Jeff Lee in 2002 and gave birth to the couple's first child Joseph Gunnar in October 2007. The family live in southern California.
