She barely had time to unpack her swimsuit and didn’t eat so much as a cockroach.

But Gemma Collins seems to have found the strains of jungle living all too much. The reality TV star quit I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here last night after only three days, moaning that she had never been so unhappy.

She can cheer herself up, though, with the knowledge that she will still pocket an estimated £40,000 for her brief time in Australia, despite appearing in just three episodes of the ITV show.

All cried out: Gemma Collins quit I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here last night after only three days

Miss Collins will, however, miss out on her full appearance fee, thought to have been almost £100,000. 

Her agent dismissed rumours that a clause in her contract would entitle her to the full amount so long as she stayed at least 72 hours, adding: ‘The show is three weeks long and Gemma was in Australia for around five days, therefore she will receive a percentage based on that.’

Her replacement Edwina Currie has already fallen foul of the local wildlife. As she prepared for her entry to the jungle later this week, she was introduced to a koala – which promptly urinated on her.

The former Tory health minister boasted that she already knows exactly how she wants to spend her own huge appearance fee.

She revealed she is taking part to pay for an extension to her home and is so delighted that she bought herself a T-shirt with a slogan boasting ‘Nice work if you can get it’. She said: ‘We need a new extension and this would pay for it – just about. We could have wrought iron balconies and everything now.’

The Only Way Is Essex star Miss Collins struggled from her first day on I’m A Celebrity when she refused to get into a helicopter and moaned about the lack of food.

The 33-year-old said she felt ‘panicked and stressed’. Explaining her decision to quit last night, she said: ‘I’m not cut out for this. I’m not having a diva fit… I love myself too much to put myself through this.’

Mrs Currie, who confessed in a book to a four-year affair with Sir John Major when both were members of the Thatcher government in the 1980s, appeared to have no qualms about swapping the political jungle for the reality TV version.

She said she had no fear of encountering rodents because ‘I used to meet a lot of rats in politics’. The 68-year-old, who has competed in Strictly Come Dancing, insisted she would not talk about her affair with Sir John while in the jungle, even if asked by BBC journalist Michael Buerk.

She admitted viewers are likely to vote for her to take on the most unpleasant tasks to punish her, adding: ‘They will probably think I’m a mini Margaret Thatcher’. 

In 2012, Mrs Currie criticised Tory MP Nadine Dorries, who was temporarily suspended by her party when she took part in I’m A Celebrity.

Mrs Dorries has now described her as a hypocrite for taking part despite disparaging the show in the past. 

But Mrs Currie brushed off the remark, saying: ‘I make it up as I go along. What did I say? That it was ritual humiliation? Well, that’s right. It is. And now I’m doing it.’
