Claims emerged on Tuesday that Karrueche Tran's on-off boyfriend Chris Brown had fathered a child with another woman.

And by Wednesday morning the 26-year-old dumped the singer via Twitter, writing: 'Listen. One can only take so much. The best of luck to Chris and his family.' 

'No baby drama for me,' the model and socialite concluded, breaking up with the troubled young man (once again) on the micro-blogging site.

She's done: Karrueche Tran broke up with Chris Brown on Twitter on Wednesday, pictured on Tuesday, following claims he fathered a child with another woman

It is unclear if Brown, 25, was on a break during his tumultuous relationship with Karrueche when he allegedly fathered the nine-month-old child.

When the news first broke on Tuesday, Karrueche was seen make-up free and looking downcast as she took her dog for a walk in Los Angeles.

TMZ reported short after that Karrueche was 'blindsised' by the baby news, having no idea about he child.

The model and socialite was casually dressed in sweats and trainers as she appeared a bit tired while clutching her cellphone and a pink dog leash.

A new dad? Brown, pictured on Monday in Atlanta, has fathered a nine-month-old baby with a model named Nia, according to TMZ

Brown's baby mama, according to TMZ, is an aspiring model and nursing student from Texas named Nia Amey.

Pictures from the 31-year-old's modelling site see her topless as she describes herself as someone who is always up for adventure.

The Hispanic Texan says in her modelling profile from 2009: 'My name is Nia Amey. I am a 25 year old aspiring model. 

Before the storm: Brown is pictured last month with on/off girlfriend of four years, Karrueche, who is not the mother of his young child

'I'm a full time nursing student and a very outgoing person. I love photography and always up for new adventures.'

TMZ claims, Nia has 'known Chris for several years'. Sources connected to both Nia and Chris told the site they are 'on very good terms', however they are currently not dating.

And perhaps adding insult to injury Karrueche has met Nia before.

The two women are in Brown's circle of friends and were both seen at a party in Las Vegas in May 2013. 

The Loyal singer has been romantically liked to model Karrueche for the past four years. However the pair's relationship has always been rocky, and the pair have frequently split before reuniting.

The pair were seen together last month, hand in hand at New York Fashion Week. But back in December, Chris launched a lengthy attack on his girlfriend via Instagram.

Out and about: Karrueche, 26, was seen out with a friend in Studio City on Monday night

After pulling her up on only visiting him once during his four months in prison, he then accused her of 'going on dates with Drake'. 

He added: 'I made it clear to the world who my girl was and and made your life equal to mine even at the cost of me not focusing on my career at times. 

'When this relationship first started u knew what it was and even participated in threesomes. I slowed all that s*** down.' 

Before dating Karrueche, Chris was in a relationship with singer Rihanna who he started dating in 2008.

On February 8, 2009, an argument in the Deuces singer's car ended with a physical altercation that left the then-20-year-old Bajan beauty hospitalised with multiple contusions to her face. 

Chris, then just 19, turned himself in to police, where he was booked under suspicion of making criminal threats. 

He was charged with felony assault and making criminal threats, before pleading not guilty at his arraignment.

Forgiven: Chris was involved with singer Rihanna before his romance with Karreuche. They started dating in 2008, split in 2009 and briefly reunited in late 2012. They're seen at the 2013 Grammy Awards

On June 22, 2009, the star pleaded guilty to a felony and accepted a plea deal of community labor, five years' formal probation, and domestic violence counseling.

Chris started dating model Karreuche in 2011 before splitting up in late 2012 when he became romantically involved with Riri again. 

After the couple split in May 2013, Chris resumed his relationship with Karreuche.
