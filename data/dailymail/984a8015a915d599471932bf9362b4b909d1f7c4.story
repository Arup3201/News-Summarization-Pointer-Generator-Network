Faced with an opponent nicknamed 'Mad Dog', Andy Murray might have been expecting quite a fight in his second round at the Australian Open.

Instead, Marinko Matosevic fairly ushered him into the last 32 this morning, going down 6-1, 6-3, 6-2 with a slew of unforced errors, detaining him for just 102 minutes.

It was a highly satisfactory bit of work for Murray, who enjoyed the precious economy of getting things over and done with quickly on what was the first day of sapping temperatures at Melbourne Park.

Murray will now face world number 55 Joao Sousa, who went through when his opponent Martin Klizan retired through injury in the fourth set of their match.

The 27 year-old Scot is now 10-0 versus Australians in his career, and the contest against Matosevic went to type. Asked if he did not like Australians he replied, 'I love Aussies, I had no idea about that. With the young players coming through here I'm not sure how long I'll keep that record up. 

Murray dropped just six games on his way to the third round

'I started extremely well today, he improved as the match went on and there were some closer games in the second and third sets that could have gone either way. I really enjoyed it even if not everyone was supporting me.

'It was nice to finish and not to be out here for too long.'

Returning to the secondary Margaret Court Arena, Murray was far too solid against the world number 81, who has destructive power while also having the ability to self-destruct.  

This was not one for the body language purists as Matosevic continually waved his arms around in frustration while the world number six also got irritated with himself at times, despite being in control from the off.

The first set took just 21 minutes as his opponent contributed 16 unforced errors. There was a small blight on Murray in him dropping serve once in the second as Matosevic lifted his level, but there were never any serious alarms.

By the end Matosevic had run up 49 unforced errors, but that should not detract from the professional performance of Murray in one of his matches that will only linger very briefly in the memory. He is easing himself towards tougher tasks ahead, although Sousa should not prove too scary a prospect.

Murray denied later that he brought any extra determination to the match after Matosevic’s comments last summer that he did not think it a good idea hiring a female coach like Amelie Mauresmo: 'No. I get on well with Marinko,' he said.

'I spoke to him a little bit about what he said. He didn't mean any harm. Everyone's entitled to their opinion on anything. If he wants to get coached by a man, that's absolutely fine.

'I have absolutely no issue with it at all. I still think he's a good guy. I wasn't trying to prove a point at all when I was playing Marinko today. I was trying to win the match.'

Occasionally Murray can be a slow starter, so he was delighted today about the way he fairly sprinted to the first set: 'I definitely started quite quickly today. I was timing the ball well on the return and serving well from the beginning of the match, and it helped a lot because obviously the crowd were behind him. I managed to take the crowd out of it a little bit by starting that quickly.'
