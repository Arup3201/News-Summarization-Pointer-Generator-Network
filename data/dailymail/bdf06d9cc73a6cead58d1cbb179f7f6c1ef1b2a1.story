First comes love, then comes marriage, then comes lawsuit... and that includes suing your former fiance for the engagement ring.

Former Houston Texans star Mario Williams who now plays for the Buffalo Bills but it seems there's a decent chunk of change still in Houston - a $785,000 engagement ring.

Williams, it would seem, wants the ring back. He has filed a lawsuit against Erin Marzouki, who was Williams’ former fiancée.

Bring that bling: Mario Williams has gone on the offensive - he wants the 10-carat $785,000 diamond engagement ring he gave to Erin Marzouki, his former fiancée, back

The suit seeks recovery of a stunning 10.04 carat diamond ring from Marzouki after she decided to end her engagement with Williams in January.

According to court documents, 'During the parties' relationship, on or about December 12, 2011, plaintiff purchased a $785,000 diamond engagement ring from Valobra Master Jewelers,' the complaint states.

Read the lawsuit in full...

'(Marzouki) never intended to marry (Williams) and used the relationship as a means to get to (Williams’) money and acquire gifts,' says the lawsuit, filed by Houston attorneys Monica Schulz Orlando and Michael Gary Orlando.

The lawyers are asking the court to obtain the ring from Ms. Marzouki until the legal action is resolved.attorneys are asking the court to obtain the ring from Marzouki and to hold it until the legal action is resolved.

Bling: The ring is a GIA certified radiant cut diamond weighing 10.04 carats, E color grade and VS2 clarity grade worth $785,000

Williams gave the engagement ring to Marzouki on February 19th 2012 along with an American Express card to which she charged $108,000 during 2012 and 'additional luxurious items' valued at about $230,000.

But it was all over within a year with when Marzouki 'unilaterally terminated' the engagement on January 21st 2013.

The court documents says Williams ex-fiance 'never intended to marry and used the relationship as a means to get money and acquire gifts.'

The lawsuit exudes Williams' bitterness over the failed relationship and states that Williams has refused requests to return the diamond engagement ring..

Rich: Wiilliams signed six-year deal with the Buffalo Bills in 2012, worth up to $100 million, with $50 million guaranteed

Lawsuit: Court documents show Erin Marzouki, 31, called off the relationship after less than a year

In one year he claims he spent $1,123,000 on a fiancée who broke up with him just months after they’d become engaged.

Williams’ lawyers are now looking to take out a restraining order that would prevent Marzouki from selling or damaging the ring or keeping any proceeds by selling it.

According to Texan law, Williams would be entitled to recovery of the ring under a 'conditional gift rule' and Williams is legally allowed to ask for it to be returned.

Williams was the first selection in the 2006 NFL draft by the Texans and played in Houston through the 2011 season.

No sympathy: Darren Rovell of ESPN puts things in perspective from a cash point of view

Rules: Some men pay 2 to 3 months salary for their fiancees engagement ring so surely it would ring true here?

Although by regular standards the ring is a fortune, it is pocket change to Williams who last year signed one of the most lucrative contracts for a defensive player in NFL history: a six-year, $100 million with the Buffalo Bills with $50 million in cash guaranteed.

ESPN's Darren Rovell noted that Williams spent three percent of initial guaranteed money Buffalo gave him on that ring whilst CBS Sports' Doug Gottlieb was also perplexed by Williams demands.
