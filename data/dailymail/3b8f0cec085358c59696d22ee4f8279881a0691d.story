Jordan has released a slickly-edited video that shows its war planes being prepared for bombing strikes against Islamic State jihadists in Syria.

The footage, understood to have been broadcast on state TV, shows troops messages on plane-mounted missiles before the fleet of fighter jets are launched from the base. 

The mission - dubbed Operation Martyr Moaz in memory of the pilot brutally killed by ISIS - is the latest show of force from the nation, which has promised a 'harsh' war against the terror group.

It comes just hours after Jordanian fighter pilots made a diversion over the hometown of their murdered comrade, Moaz al-Kasasbeh, on their return from an air raid this morning.

Dozens of jets bombed ISIS training centers and weapons storage sites in Syria and struck targets neighbouring Iraq for the first time - intensifying attacks against the militants.

The assault came after Jordan's King Abdullah II visited the grieving Kasasbeh family in Aya village.

It has now been two days ISIS released a horrific 22-minute long video showing the pilot being burnt alive while locked in a cage.

The act has been widely condemned as among the most sickening ever committed to film and has sent waves of revulsion across the region.

In response, Jordan executed two Iraqi militants connected with ISIS, including Sajida al-Rishawi, the female would-be suicide bomber whose freedom ISIS had originally demanded in exchange for releasing Kasasbeh.

The air strike video, released today on the YouTube channel of a national radio station, is the latest show of strength. It is understood to have been recorded at Muwaffaq Salti Air Base. 

The military's statement, read on state TV, was entitled, 'This is the beginning and you will get to know the Jordanians' - an apparent warning to ISIS. 

It said the strikes will continue 'until we eliminate them.'

With its stirring soundtrack and complex editing, the video is similar in style to those released by ISIS, which have been striking in their professional use of camera and editing equipment.

The clip shows uniformed people, believed to be members of the Jordanian military, writing messages in Arabic across plane-mounted missiles. One reads 'for you, the enemy of Islam'.

Target: This footage is believed to show Jordanian forces bombing Islamic State sites in Syria today

The video also features a pilot holding up a sign that reads: 'And do not think that God is unaware of what the evildoers are doing' - an apparent warning to ISIS militants. The message is based on a passage in the Quran

The video also features a pilot holding up a sign that reads: 'And do not think that God is unaware of what the evildoers are doing' - an apparent warning to ISIS militants.  

There are aerial shots that appear to show Jordanian forces bombing ISIS training centres and weapon storage sites in Syria.

As part of the new campaign, Jordan is also attacking targets in Iraq, Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh said. Until now, Jordan had only struck ISIS targets in Syria as part of a U.S.-led military coalition.

'We said we are going to take this all the way, we are going to go after them wherever they are and we're doing that," Judeh told Fox News.

Asked if Jordan was now carrying out attacks in both countries, he said: 'That's right. Today more Syria than Iraq, but like I said it's an ongoing effort.'

He added: 'They're in Iraq and they are in Syria and therefore you have to target them wherever they are.' 

The militant group controls about one-third of each Syria and Iraq, both neighbors of Jordan.

The Jordanian military said dozens of fighter jets were involved in Thursday's strikes on training centers and weapons storage sites.

Earlier today, war planes roared overhead as the King paid a condolence visit to the tribal family of the pilot in his village in southern Jordan.

State television showed a sombre-looking King sitting alongside the army chief and senior officials while visiting  Aya, a village  60 miles south of the capital Amman.

Thousands of Jordanians flocked to pay respects in traditional Arab Bedouin style in a part of the country where influential tribes form an important pillar of the Hashemite rule, supplying the army and security forces with its manpower.

At one point the King pointed out the aircraft as he sat next to the victim's father, Saif al-Kasasbeh.

'You are a wise monarch. These criminals violated the rules of war in Islam and they have no humanity. Even humanity disowns them,' he told the King.

The Jordanian fighter jets carried out new air strikes a day after King Abdullah vowed to wage a 'harsh' war against Islamic State militants who control parts of neighboring Syria and Iraq.

The army statement did not say which country was targeted.

Uncompromising language: King Abdullah II has said Jordan's response 'will be harsh because this terrorist organisation is not only fighting us, but also fighting Islam and its pure values'

Jordan is part of a U.S.-led military coalition that has bombed IS targets in both countries since the autumn, but until now Jordanian warplanes are only known to have carried out raids in Syria.

King Abdullah II has said Jordan's response 'will be harsh because this terrorist organisation is not only fighting us, but also fighting Islam and its pure values.'

In a statement, he pledged to hit the militants 'hard in the very centre of their strongholds'.

In Washington, leading members of Congress have called for increased U.S. military assistance to the kingdom. 

Currently, the United States provides Jordan with $1 billion a year in economic and military aid.

Not true: False rumours spread online yesterday that King Abdullah II is preparing to personally take part in airstrikes against ISIS. The Royal Hashemite Court's official Facebook page later shared this image of the King wearing a pilot's uniform, which some mistakenly took to mean he had carried out an air raid

Return home: King Abdullah of Jordan arrives as Jordanians stand along the way between Amman and Queen Alia airport waiting to greet him upon his arrival on Wednesday

The visit comes after a Jordanian government spokesman denied rumours that the King is preparing to personally take part in airstrikes against ISIS.

In a statement Mohammed al-Momani branded said the reports that the King - who is a trained pilot - will soon conduct raids himself are unfounded and baseless.

Rumours spread online yesterday that the King was considering a combat role in the war after he promised to fight back against ISIS, insisting Kasaesbeh's death 'will not be in vain'.

The Royal Hashemite Court's official Facebook page later shared an image of the King wearing a pilot's uniform, which some mistakenly - including several Iraqi news outlets - took to mean he had carried out an air raid. 

Other social media users then starting sharing old photographs on the King sitting in a plane's cockpit, suggesting the images were taken on his return from a sortie to Syria. 

Before becoming king, Abdullah was a military general who headed the Jordanian special forces. 

He is also a fully qualified Cobra Helicopter pilot and in 1980 joined Sandhurst - the British Royal military academy also attended by Prince William and Prince Harry.
