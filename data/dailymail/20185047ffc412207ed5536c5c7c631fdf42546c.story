'Killer': Luis Toledo told police he killed his wife with a single blow to her throat as they argued

A husband who allegedly confessed to killing his wife after she said she wanted a divorce has been charged with her murder - but has refused to tell authorities where her body is.

Luis Toledo, a 31-year-old with martial arts training, told police he had struck 28-year-old Yessenia Suarez with a single deadly blow to her throat after confronting her over messages on her phone from another man.

But he denied hurting her two children, nine-year-old Thalia and eight-year-old Michael Otto, who have also been missing from their Daytona Beach, Florida home for six days.

Toledo had previously been described as a 'person of interest' in the case but police said he confessed to the killing and on Monday he was charged with second-degree murder.

No charges have been brought in connection with the children's disappearances. An unsuccessful search for them was held at the weekend but was temporarily suspended on Monday, the Orlando Sentinel reported.

Police said that at the time of Suarez's disappearance, she had been talking about leaving him and last Tuesday, he went to her work to confront her and a coworker he claimed she had been seeing.

The coworker was not there but during the argument, Toledo, who told police he was trained in martial arts, slapped his wife before fleeing, authorities said.

Charged: Toledo was charged with second-degree murder in the death of his wife after confessing to police

The following day, police officer went to check on her and the children after her mother called to report that she was unable to get through to her daughter.

Toledo arrived back at the home and told authorities that he had slept in the car following an argument and had returned to find his wife and the children missing, police said.

Toledo - a
known gang member - was initially arrested on a domestic battery charge.

But a neighbor told police that Toledo had asked for help dropping off his wife's car at 6am on Wednesday and they took it to Lake Mary, the Sentinel reported.

Police added that a search of the couple's home also revealed blood.

A Florida missing child alert was issued for both children early Thursday.

Confirmed dead: Yessenia Suarez, 28, and her children, 8-year-old Michael Otto and 9-year-old Thalia Otto disappeared after the woman had an alleged domestic dispute with Toledo last week. Police confirmed that all three were dead

Toledo eventually admitted that during an argument with Suarez on Tuesday night, she became aggressive towards him and he hit her in the throat with an open blow, killing her, police said.

But he denied hurting the children and even implicated another person in their deaths, police said.

After his arrest, he attempted suicide in the bathroom at the Sheriff's Office's Operations Center using a shattered mirror and underwent treatment.

He is being held in the Volusia County Branch Jail in Daytona Beach without bail.

'The
search for the victimsâ€™ bodies and the investigation into their deaths 
is still ongoing,' authorities said in a statement.

The woman's family has suspected Toledo from the beginning.

'Please,
please I beg you Luis,' Felicia Perez, Ms Suarez's mother said, 
according to Click Orlando said. 'You know you know where they at, 
please, that's all I ask.'

Characterized
by the sheriff's office as a gang member, Mr Toledo has multiple 
arrests and has even served time in prison under an alias.

He has multiple burglary, kidnapping and firearms charges brought against him in the past, according to ClickOrlando.

Mr Toledo even served a four-year 
prison term under the name Michael Garcia. He has also been arrested 
under the names Luis Colon and Hector Soto, according to records cited 
by ClickOrlando.
