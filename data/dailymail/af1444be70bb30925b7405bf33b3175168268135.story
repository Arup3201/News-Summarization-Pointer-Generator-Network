The Indonesian courts have received a request to review the death sentences of Australians Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, their lawyers say. 

A Bali court registrar visited Kerobokan prison on Friday, where the Australians are jailed for their role in the Bali Nine heroin trafficking plot.

Lawyer Todung Mulya Lubis said an application for a judicial review of the case had been accepted.

'It has been accepted, it will go to the courts, then it depends on the district court heads,' he told reporters.

'There should not be an execution because the legal process should be respected as well.'

It comes after Sukumaran's grandmother delivered an impassioned plea for her grandson's life at a candlelight vigil in Sydney on Thursday night.

Edith Visvanathan rose from her wheelchair in front of hundreds of supporters as she tearfully said 'Don't kill him. Please, don't kill him' after Indonesia's attorney general announced that Sukumaran and fellow Bali Nine inmate Andrew Chan were among the next drug offenders in line for execution.

Mr Lubis said the review - the last legal effort to save the men - should consider the pair's rehabilitation over the past 10 years, and their right to life as protected in the constitution.

But it's unclear whether these arguments will be considered, because of legal uncertainty over how many reviews a prisoner is entitled to have.

Mr Lubis said Sukumaran and Chan should have every opportunity to seek justice.

'We have the constitutional right to file the PK and we hope the District Court of Denpasar will proceed,' he said.

The PK is asking for the death sentences to be commuted to life, not an acquittal, he stressed.

'Those two men, the petitioners, have changed a great deal.

'They have become good men.'

The attorney-general is reportedly of the view the PK should not proceed.

But Mr Lubis said it wasn't his call to make: 'I'm dealing with the courts,' he said.

Hundreds of supporters gathered in Sydney's Martin Place on Thursday evening and created a candlelight vigil for the two Australians on death row

Sukumaran's grandmother, Edith Visvanathan, delivered an emotional speech in front of hundreds who gathered at the Music for Mercy event in Sydney's Martin Place on Thursday evening in support of her grandson and Chan.

'I love him so much,' Mrs Visvanathan said of Sukumaran.

'I am very, very sad, and very, very weak.

'But today I come here to ask a pardon from the president and the people of Indonesia.

'Don't kill him. Please, don't kill him.'

Hopes are fading that Sukumaran, 33, and Chan, 31, will avoid an Indonesian firing squad.

It emerged on Wednesday the two are among the next group of prisoners scheduled for execution.

'We are all worried and don't know what to do,' Mrs Visvanathan said.

'I don't ask for him to come home. I only ask for him to live.

'He has proved himself. He is a good boy.'

Earlier, vigil organiser and artist Ben Quilty recalled being struck by Sukumaran's smile when they first met at Bali's Kerobokan prison.

He choked back tears as he spoke of the pain he felt knowing their most recent meeting could be their last.

'Andrew and Myuran did some really bad things,' he said.

'But I can tell you, they are good young men now.

Other speakers talked about the men's rehabilitation in Kerobokan prison and the assistance they have given fellow prisoners.

With the initiative of Chan and Sukumaran, the prison now has a computer room, cooking school and guest classes from experts in yoga, dance, reflexology and philosophy.

'Andrew and Myuran are positive, generous young men, humbly pursuing the path to reform,' Mercy Campaign co-founder Matthew Goldberg said.

Musicians including Megan Washington, Josh Pyke and Paul Mac performed, each beginning with the phrase of the evening: 'I stand for mercy.'

In messages sent via lawyers in Bali and read by actor David Wenham, Chan and Sukumaran thanked supporters.

'We're amazed how kind and supportive everyone has been,' Sukumaran's message read.

'It has helped our families so much.'

'As we face what's coming, we thank everyone who has supported us.'

Chan asked the crowd to use the occasion to ponder the meaning of mercy and to think of those facing execution around the world.

Sukumaran and Chan's lawyer says the men hope the courts will hear a second judicial review, known as a PK, which will likely be lodged on Friday

A petition calling for the men's lives to be spared has 135,000 signatures. 

Their Indonesian lawyer Todung Mulya Lubis says the men hope the courts will hear a second judicial review, known as a PK, which will likely be lodged on Friday.

'We are doing our best to save them,' he said on Thursday.

Kerobokan prison governor Sudjonggo says even though the pair aren't allowed out to personally petition for the review, that shouldn't stop it being filed.

'There are other ways to do this, perhaps it can be registered here,' he said.

'It all depends on how the lawyers want to do it.'

But legal argument between Indonesia's constitutional and supreme courts over how many reviews a prisoner can have means it's uncertain whether lawyers for Chan and Sukumaran will have their day in court.
