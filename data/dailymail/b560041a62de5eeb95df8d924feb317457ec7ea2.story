The UN was accused of meddling in 
British affairs last night after it said new immigration rules could 
introduce ethnic profiling of asylum seekers and refugees.

In
 an extraordinary report, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said 
strengthened immigration policies designed to prevent health and benefit
 tourism could leave immigrants feeling stigmatised.

The
 measures have been introduced by the Government to verify migrants' 
immigration status before they receive health and housing benefits. 
Angry Tory MPs branded the report foolish, irresponsible, Left-wing 
garbage.

Meddling: Antonio Guterres, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, has focused on Britain

They also questioned why commissioner Antonio Guterres was focusing on Britain when two million Syrian refugees are in desperate need of help.

The spat comes three months after the UN provoked a furious row by announcing an inquiry into whether changes in housing benefit in Britain nicknamed the bedroom tax broke human rights law.

UN official Raquel Rolnik was branded 'overpaid, over-mighty and unaccountable' after visiting Britain uninvited to carry out an inspection of housing conditions and check they provided 'an adequate standard of living'.

The latest attack was made in a paper delivered to the Commons Public Bill Committee examining the Immigration Bill â€“ key Coalition legislation intended to discourage illegal immigration.

Delivered in the name of former Portuguese prime minister Mr Guterres, it said the new law's proposals 'could negatively affect the reception and integration' of refugees and asylum seekers.

But Tory Vice-Chairman Bob Neill said: 'Antonio Guterres is best known for boosting benefits in Portugal and quitting just before his party was booted out. We will not take lectures about how to manage our borders from a failed Portuguese socialist turned unelected bureaucrat.

'While he tries to score cheap political points, this Government is taking the difficult long-term decisions needed to ensure it is easier to remove illegal immigrants and stop abuse of public services.'

The report said plans to ask landlords, banks and GPs to check the immigration status of new tenants, account holders and patients were 'likely to result in asylum seekers, refugees and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection being stigmatised in the public mind and in their being denied access to housing or bank accounts'.

It added: 'Such measures could contribute towards a climate of misunderstanding and ethnic profiling that could undermine the longer-term prospects for integration of such persons and prove detrimental to social cohesion.'

Among its demands is that Home Secretary Theresa May drops her plan to instruct courts to give 'little weight' to claims made by illegal immigrants that they should not be deported because they have established families in Britain.

Ministers declined to comment on the UN intervention yesterday but there was deep anger among senior Tory MPs.

Priti Patel, MP for Witham, said: 'This is an over-reaction, using emotional language which I regard as irresponsible. It is important that Parliament and British law determine immigration policy.'

Clacton MP Douglas Carswell said: 'There is absolutely nothing inappropriate about a sovereign country deciding who should be allowed to come and live within its borders and be entitled to benefits and who should not.'

Peter Bone, who represents Wellingborough, said: 'This is Left-wing garbage. It should be treated with utter contempt.'

The intervention by the UN is the third by a senior official since autumn 2011.

In the first, Professor Yves Cabannes, chairman of the UN committee on forced evictions, appeared at the Dale Farm illegal traveller camp in Essex to condemn evictions by the local council that had been approved by British courts.

Then this autumn Miss Rolnik made an inspection tour of Britain, after which she condemned Coalition housing benefit reforms and called for more public spending on housing and rent controls.

Britain has now sent border officials to help Ireland tighten its borders.
