An ill-tempered 22-pound cat that trapped a family of three from Oregon in a bedroom has been sent to a shelter.

Teresa Barker and Lee Palmer, from Portland, Oregon, called the Multnomah County Animal Services Monday and asked to come and pick up their now-infamous black-and-white house cat named Lux.

Lux shot to Internet stardom two weeks ago when he turned on his family, forcing his owners to call 911.

Mr Palmer told an emergency services dispatcher March 9 that he kicked the cat after it scratched his 8-month-old baby.

In response, the feisty feline went ballistic, leading Palmer and his girlfriend to barricade themselves, their baby and the family dog in the bedroom.

Portland police arrived and captured Lux on top of the refrigerator using a snare.

Shelter director Mike Oswald the family have not made a final decision on whether to keep Lux.

‘They are wrestling with the decision whether to keep the cat,’ Oswald told The Oregonian.

According to a press release put out by the shelter Tuesday, a local cat behavior specialist has offered his services for Lux whether he stays with his current owners or is put up for adoption.

The owners of Lux, a 22-pound housecat that trapped them in their bedroom after attacking their baby insist they are not giving up on their pet and are instead getting it therapy

'This is a very shy, somewhat 
high-strung cat,' animal technician Karen McGill told KGW. 'Cats like 
these... they can only take this much.'

The
 shelter employee added that the presence of a vocal baby in the home 
and the house's close proximity to a train station may have contributed to Lux's aggressive behavior.

Two days after the cat attack, Lux's owners insisted that they are not going to give up on their pet and will instead get it therapy.

'We're not getting rid of him right now,' Palmer said last week. 'He's been part of our family for a long time.'

Palmer said Lux lunged at his seven-month-old child after the baby pulled its tail.

The child, Jesse, suffered a few scratches on the forehead, but did not require medical attention

On the 911 call, Palmer tells the dispatcher he kicked the cat 'in the rear' to protect his child.

Like butter wouldn't melt: Lux is a Himalayan with a 'history of violence,' say his owners. They were forced to call 911 on Sunday after Lux attacked their baby and then cornered them in a bedroom

Palmer says the animal then 'just went off over the edge' - leading him and his girlfriend to barricade themselves, their baby and the family dog in the bedroom for safety.

The cat can be heard screeching in the background of the call as Palmer says in a panicked voice:

'He's charging us. He's at our bedroom door.' Palmer also tells the dispatcher the cat has been violent in the past.

Officers used a dog snare to capture the animal, and placed it in a crate.

The cat attack story gained national attention after police put out a news release about it.

Lee Palmer said the family had received offers from people wanting to adopt Lux, but the family said at the time they are not taking them up on it.
