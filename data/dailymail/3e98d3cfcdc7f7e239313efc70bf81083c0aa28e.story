This may be the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, but Venus Ebony Starr Williams was not going to rush for anybody’s rules.

Her opponent, Kurumi Nara of Japan, was in her chair, baking quietly in the piercing midday sun. A sprinkling of spectators grew impatient and started a slow handclap.

Finally, nine minutes late, out strolled the long limbs of Miss Williams. She walked over to her chair and promptly sat down.

Now, Court 3 is situated between the 
perimeter wall and the path to the first-aid centre, undeniably on the 
edge of the club but hardly on another planet. So why this delay?

‘Was
 I late?’ she pondered, before adding philosophically: ‘What is late? I 
mean, I guess she got there early. I don’t know what time she got 
there.’

Williams later 
denied that a change of underwear from coloured to regulation white was 
the cause, so we can only assume that cool hauteur had something to do 
with it. Five times a champion in SW19, I’ll show up when I’m jolly well
 ready. She even walked off after knocking up. But, the intriguing 
preliminaries observed, it was rip-roaring tennis from the moment 
Williams threw her Amazonian shoulders into the very first point: a big 
forehand winner.

Nara, just 
5ft 1in and a full foot shorter than her opponent, scampered, chased and
 fought gamely. She barely made a mistake. Sometimes she was stretching 
up to hit the ball at eye-level, whereas Williams collapsed her knees to
 do so.

Williams, who 
suffers from the energy-sapping Sjogren’s syndrome, still struck the 
ball mighty hard. Her first serve averaged 118mph; poor little Nara’s 
86mph.

But Nara started 
strongly, taking a 3-0 lead before Williams levelled the scores. The 
pendulum swung towards Williams at 5-3, but the first set went to a 
tiebreak. That, too, went one way and then the other: Nara led 4-1 
before Williams rattled off six straight points.

Nara
 needed treatment at the end of the first set, returning to the court 
with a strapped left thigh. It did not seem to limit her too much — and 
she did not blame the injury afterwards — but Williams won six 
consecutive games to win 7-6, 6-1.

What
 an athletic specimen Venus is at the age of 34. Don’t take my word for 
it; hear what she thinks. ‘Wisdom has served me well,’ she said. ‘I’ve 
worn my sunscreen so I haven’t aged terribly. My knees are very tight, 
not saggy. And the crow’s feet have been kept at bay. So I’ll give 
myself an A+.’

But in truth
 nobody expects much of the elder Williams sister these days. She is 
seeded 30th here, and before had reached the third round only 
twice in her last nine grand slams. Her most notable contribution of 
recent times was to pose naked for ESPN The Magazine’s Body Issue.

Yet
 her durability is magnificent given the Sjogren’s syndrome, an 
incurable auto-immune disease that causes fatigue and joint pain — a 
handicap in the world of high-performance tennis. She has fallen asleep 
at the wheel of her car and is exhausted if she trains too hard. A vegan
 diet and recuperation are her remedies.

So
 is she contemplating drawing a line under her dazzling career? ‘Well, I
 don’t like watching tennis on TV,’ she said, while wearing not so much 
earrings as napkin rings. ‘I want to be out there. I’m not about the 
easy life. Life is a challenge.

‘When
 I leave tennis, I want it to be on my own terms. I want to know I rose 
to every challenge. I want to look back with no regrets. So far I can do
 that. Everyone messes up. Everyone chokes.  Everyone loses matches they
 should have won. But as long as you walked out there and gave it your 
all, you can look back with no regrets.’

Next
 up is Petra Kvitova, the 2011 champion. Please rest up Venus, but don’t
 forget to set your alarm. We don’t want you late again.
