A plane that crashed into spectators at an air race in Reno last year bore modifications that weakened its structure and showed evidence that the pilot flew it beyond its limits, investigators said Monday.

The National Transportation Safety Board
deemed the failure of a tail structure to be the probable cause of the 
crash of the souped-up World War II-era P-51 Mustang fighter that killed
pilot Jimmy Leeward and 10 people on the ground at last year's National Championship Air Races in Reno. More than 70 were injured.

Leeward
also was blamed for failing to fully document and test extensive 
modifications to the aircraft before the September 2011 crash.

Modified: The 'Galloping Ghost' P-51 Mustang had a series ill-tested changes that make it weaker, less stable and too fast

Crash: This is the split-second before the World War II-era plane crashed into spectators -- killing 10 people on the ground, as well as the pilot

Board member Robert Sumwalt said: 'If you want to go out and fly fast and try to win, that's one thing.'

'If
you're modifying an aircraft without fully understanding how the 
modifications can affect the aerodynamics, you're playing Russian 
roulette,' Sumwalt said.

Structural modifications of the aircraft dubbed the Galloping Ghost made it lighter and reduced drag, according to the NTSB
report. But flight control modifications also made the aircraft less 
stable. The NTSB found that an elevator trim tab malfunction created 
aerodynamic instability that made Leeward's plane uncontrollable.

High-resolution photos show the skin wrinkling and a the canopy separating the plane seconds before the crash, and NTSB investigators later found loose screws in the crucial tail assembly.

At a board hearing in Washington, Chairwoman Deborah Hersman
blamed the 74-year-old Leeward for 'operating at the edge of the 
envelope' without fully reporting and testing modifications to his 
plane.

Horror: More than 70 people were injured in the crash September 16, 2011, pictured a split-second after it occurred

Tricked out: The Galloping Ghost had its wings cut, its cockpit sheared down, the dorsal fuel tank removed and its tail clipped -- all in an effort to make it faster

Blame: Jimmy Leeward was faulted for not reporting or testing the modifications to his aircraft

Leeward was 'incapacitated' and probably became unconscious when gravitational 
forces reached 17 times normal as the propeller aircraft -- flying faster
than it ever had before -- pitched skyward, rolled upside down and 
slammed nose-first into the tarmac amid rows of box seats, NTSB 
investigators found. The tail stabilizer fell from the plane during the 
steep climb.

NTSB officials say Leeward had perhaps one second to 
respond, but the G forces on his body far exceeded the levels of human 
tolerance. People can begin to experience loss of consciousness at 5G.

With
races set to start September 12, the five-member panel has already issued 
several preliminary reports and recommendations for the Federal Aviation
Administration and race organizers to improve safety. Some 
recommendations were modified on Monday.

Hersman noted that the board is an independent investigative and recommendation body, not a regulator.

'We make recommendations. It's up to others to implement them,' she said. 'They've done that.'

A
spokesman for the air races said last week that event officials 
wouldn't comment on NTSB reports ahead of the board's findings on the 
cause of the crash. But he said event officers were improving preflight 
inspections.

Efforts to reach Leeward family members Monday in Ocala, Florida, weren't immediately successful.

NTSB
officials say the 530 mph that Leeward reached during a qualifying race
was about 40 mph faster than he had ever gone before.

His
age and physical condition weren't considered significant factors in 
the crash, but Hersman was critical of Leeward's record-keeping and 
reports of the modifications that he had made.

'He put that he was 59 
years old on the entry form,' the board chairwoman said. 'He was 74.'

Anatomy of a disaster: This is a detailed map of the flight path and crash site of the Galloping Ghost. The National Transportation Safety Board provided a detailed analysis of the horrific accident

Examination: The NTSB offered a list of causes of the crash and several safety recommendations

The
air race championship, entering its 49th year, is the only event of its
kind in the world. It draws thousands every year to Reno Stead Airport,
where it features aircraft flying at speeds of over 500 mph sometimes 
wingtip-to-wingtip around an oval pylon track.

The crash spawned civil liability lawsuits against the pilot's family and mechanics and the host organization.

Some
critics called for ending the event, but organizers pressed forward 
with plans for this year's races amid promises that most NTSB safety 
recommendations would be implemented.

The National Air-racing Group Inc and the Reno Air Racing Association Inc
balked at requiring pilots to wear flight suits designed to mitigate 
high gravitational forces. They said the expensive suits might prove too
bulky for cramped cockpits and too hot during competition.

Insurance
premiums jumped from $300,000 last year to $2 million this year, but 
the Nevada state tourism commission last month approved a $600,000 
sponsorship to help the Reno Air Racing Association Inc. meet a Sept. 1 
deadline for its final insurance payment.
