Some people buy environmentally-friendly products because they are concerned about their impact on the world but others only do so because it fits with the eco-friendly image of themselves they want to promote, scientists have said.

Korean researchers found that many older people choose to spend large sums of money on a hybrid car because it boosts their self-esteem and image.

They said that some people want to be seen as the type of person who cares about the planet by driving an expensive eco-friendly model - and would even choose one to evoke their neighbours' green-eyed monster.

Korean researchers found that older people might choose to spend a more money on a hybrid car (such as the Prius pictured) as it boosts their self esteem and image. Prestige, price and quality are major influences on older people's decisions to buy 'pro-environment' vehicles, they said

They said prestige, price and quality are major influences on older people's decisions to buy 'pro-environment' vehicles.

The findings, published in the journal Human Factors and Ergonomics in Manufacturing and Service Industries suggest that less visible green products are not as desirable as they cannot be shown off.

'If I want to pay $5 for a 'green' 
detergent or sponge, I'll know that I'm helping the environment. But 
those things aren't highly visible. Other people aren't going to notice,' said Dr Jay Yoo, an assistant professor of family and consumer sciences at Baylor's College of Arts & Sciences.

The researchers from the universities of Baylor and Yonsei as well as Pykyoung National University in South Korea, believe their study could prove significant as some segments of the older-consumer population control a 
considerable share of the discretionary income in the United States and
 the population size of the 'mature market' is growing rapidly.

The scientists analysed 314 consumers aged 60 and older who had bought hybrid cars and found that their satisfaction was influenced by social values, including pride and prestige, as well as quality and price, not only in vehicle purchase but in future savings on gasoline expenses.

Dr Yoo believes three variables - social value, price and quality - are significant in enhancing senior citizens' customer loyalty as shown by repurchase intention and positive word-of-mouth.

Interestingly, emotional values such as excitement, did not significantly influence their purchase intentional or satisfaction, according to the study.

The team said: 'The findings suggest that elderly consumers are concerned about how they appear to others when driving a hybrid car.

'They believe that driving a hybrid car builds a positive self-image of the people who drive them.'

Dr Yoo said that the knowledge gained from he study could be used to market the vehicles as well as other green products.

'Hybrid cars have increased in visibility because of their environmental consciousness. So people may be willing to pay an extra $5,000 or so in order to think, "I'm great, and this is good for the environment,"' he said.

Previous research has shown that older consumers are more inclined to behave in a pro-environment way than younger generations.
