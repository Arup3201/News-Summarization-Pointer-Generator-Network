The head of a failing children's services that let down murdered schoolboy Daniel Pelka should stand down immediately, an MP has said.

Colin Green announced he would be standing down from his job in September as a result of an appalling assessment by Ofsted that rated Coventry's primary schools as the worst in the country.

However, Geoffrey Robinson MP said he should leave now.

In an extraordinary outburst, the MP for Coventry North West said that Daniel had been 'badly let down' by his mother and stepfather, health professionals and social services.

Calling for Mr Green to go immediately, he said: 'He takes with him the indelible stain of Daniel's cruel death, which his department had failed to prevent.'

An MP today called for the head of children's services that failed schoolboy Daniel Pelka (pictured) to stand down immediately after his parents were convicted of his murder

Guilty: Luczak, left, and Krezolek, right, who were found guilty of murder. They will be sentenced tomorrow

Daniel's mother Magdalena Luczak, 27, and stepfather Mariusz Krezolek, 34, were found guilty of his murder yesterday.

In what was a harrowing case of 
cruelty, Birmingham Crown Court heard he had been starved so badly he 
looked like a 'concentration camp victim'.

He was also locked in a tiny room, force-fed salt and held underwater in a bath until he was unconscious.

Mr Robinson added: Mr Robinson said: 
'How can the staff at the school attended by Daniel have failed to have 
recognised patterns of behaviour that should have set alarm bells 
ringing, not only within the school but within the corridors of power 
within the Council House?

'How could anyone believe it to be 
normal for a child to climb on the top of furniture to get to food; to 
scavenge around bins to access waste; and to steal food from the 
lunch-boxes?

'What human being, with the slightest 
understanding of children, would not have been concerned enough to take 
action to set alarm bells ringing?

'Where were these individuals when Daniel needed them most? Bureaucracy triumphed over common sense, care, and compassion.

'Those who failed Daniel must examine 
their own consciences, and conclude whether it is appropriate for them 
to remain in their posts.'

Luczak and Krezolek also hoodwinked 
the authorities who then missed crucial opportunities to save the boy 
who had been starved for six months.

Yesterday neither Luczak nor Krezolek showed any emotion as the jury found them guilty of murdering the boy.

Daniel was a ‘bag of bones’ when he died, despite the fact that teachers had seen him stealing food from bins.

And social services closed the file on him even after the couple waited 12 hours to take him to hospital with a broken arm.

Convicted killers: Magdelena Luczak, Daniel's mother, and his stepfather Mariusz Krezolek who were found guilty of murder by a jury at Birmingham Crown Court

Following the trial, it emerged:

During the nine-week trial, 
Birmingham Crown Court heard how Daniel was systematically starved, 
tortured, force-fed salt and locked in a home-made cell in Coventry for 
days.

'Those with the ultimate duty of care turned Daniel from a beautiful and bright-eyed little boy into a broken bag of bones'

Detective Inspector Chris Hanson

He was so frightened of Krezolek – who
 forced him to perform punishment exercises such as squat thrusts – that
 he would wet himself when spoken to by an adult man.

By the time he died a few months short of his fifth birthday he weighed 1st 9lbs, the same as an 18-month-old child.

He also stood 3ft 3inches tall, six 
inches smaller than the average. His body bore 30 separate injuries, 
including the fatal bleed on his brain caused by a violent assault to 
the head.

Police never established which of the 
pair delivered the blow, but Daniel spent his final hours locked in his 
cell on the mattress he was forced to use as a bed and toilet.

By the time Luczak made a ‘staged’ 999 call on March 3 last year, two days after the assault, he had been dead for a few hours.

Luczak and Krezolek were arrested two 
days later after a post mortem examination found Daniel died from a 
large subdural haematoma.

Krezolek, who was described as a 
‘monster’ in court, also admitted that he went online to check his bank 
account and the price of car tyres after the assault.

Birmingham Crown Court also heard 
that the couple had sex just hours before they were arrested. Luczak 
later accused Krezolek of raping her.

But days later she was observed 
holding and stroking her lover’s hand in the dock of Coventry 
magistrates' court as the pair appeared charged with murder.

Guilty:  Magdalena Luczak, 27, left, told police
 she had been raped by her partner to try and cover up the fact they 
were starving and beating four-year-old Daniel Pelka (right)

In court, the couple both denied 
muirder and blamed each other for his death, with Luczak claiming 
Krezolek attacked Daniel after he wet the bed and Krezolek saying he was
 injured in a series of falls.

But prosecutor Jonas Hankin, QC, said
 a series of sickening texts in Polish between the pair showed the 
extent to which they acted as a ‘team’ to abuse the boy.

At the time of the abuse, Krezolek and Luczak were both drinking heavily and taking drugs, including cannabis and amphetamines.

The court heard how the couple 
managed to trick officials into believing that Daniel was suffering from
 a genetically inherited eating disorder which left him permanently 
hungry.

His teacher Lisa Godfrey described 
seeing him scavenging in classmates’ lunchboxes for food and likened his
 gaunt appearance to that of a ‘leukaemia’ sufferer.

Questioning: Luczak - seen in a court artist's sketch - was accused of having lied to try and 'save her own skin' today during her trial at Birmingham Crown Court

Witnesses said he was ‘disappearing’ 
inside his school uniform and looked ‘desperate and lonely’. By then, he
 had been reduced to looking in playground bins.

The pair told the school that he 
should not be fed as it would interfere with the medication for the 
fictional condition, so staff locked up the other children’s lunchboxes.

But despite their concerns and 
suspicions – especially after teaching staff saw him with bruising to 
his neck and black eyes – nothing was done.

Police were also aware of both 
defendants and attended the couple’s home at least three times in the 
year before Daniel’s murder.

Social services had become involved after the couple waited 12 hours to take Daniel to hospital when he broke his arm.

Prosecutors believe Krezolek broke Daniel’s arm ‘clean in half’, but the couple said he had fallen off a sofa.

The senior investigating officer in 
the case, Detective Inspector  Chris Hanson, said: ‘Those with the 
ultimate duty of care turned Daniel from a beautiful and bright-eyed 
little boy into a broken bag of bones.

'They left him, starving, locked in a room in the dark to die on his own.’

Peter Wanless of the NSPCC, said: 
‘Once again crucial questions need to be asked about how a youngster 
slipped through the child protection net with the most catastrophic of 
consequences.’

A serious case review into the 
tragedy, commissioned by Coventry Safeguarding Children’s Board, is due 
to be completed in September.

The couple are expected to be sentenced tomorrow.
