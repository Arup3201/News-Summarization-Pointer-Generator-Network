The holiday shack from the much-loved iconic Australian film The Castle will be listed on the market from next week, with an asking price of $240,000.

The 1997 classic film told the story of how a Melbourne family battled to protect their beloved home after a nearby airport wanted to expand onto their property.

Inside the Kerrigans' castle features two bedrooms, an open-plan kitchen, bathroom, laundry room, dining and living area that opens onto the famous verandah.

The Bonnie Doon shack was a getaway retreat for the Kerrigan family, where they came to soak up the serenity and enjoy water sports, views of the power lines and a backyard for kick boxing.

In 2011, the lakeside home in Victoria was listed by real estate agent Andrew Houghton for a 'dreaming' price at $195,000 but was dropped to $165,950 after it failed to sell.

But the humble cottage on Maintongood Road has been used as a popular rental site for holidaymakers since the movie went to air in the 90s.

The beautifully renovated home was the original holiday shack from the classic hit film The Castle

The Bonnie Doon shack comes with two bedrooms, great for starting a new family in a peaceful neighbourhood

Located 165 kilometres from Melbourne and opposite Lake Eildon, the serene property is flanked by an empty paddock and approximately 500 metres from a boat ramp.

Prospective buyers will have the opportunity to purchase one of Australia’s monuments, which also comes with the original power lines from the film, with the deal expected to go through a private sale.

The Castle is one of Australia's  favourite comedies and most quoted catch phrases about a typical 'Aussie' family who were forced to leave their home by the Government and airport authorities.

When the airport tries to buy them out to make way for a new freight terminal, father of four Darryl Kerrigan decides to fight the eviction because 'a man's home is his castle!'

The working-class tow-truck driver hires an incompetent attorney  but the court rejects the family's appeal and gives them two weeks to vacate.

Just when it all seems to be lost, Darryl meets Lawrence Hammill, who happens to be a retired Queen's Counsel experienced in the area of Constitutional law.

Lawrence takes interest in the Kerrigans' case and offers to help Darryl take his case all the way to the highest court in Australia and the rest is history.

The prospective buyer will need their own bug zapper for their verandah - just like the movie!
