The live tiger mascot for Louisiana State University has missed all seven homes games this season - opting instead to stay in his luxurious enclosure.

Mike VI is the latest in LSU's dynasty of tigers that have represented the team since 1936.

Between games, he lives in a 15,000-square-foot environment with a waterfall, stream, rocks, trees, and personal carers.

But for the past few weeks, his keepers have failed to coax him into the bespoke cage that takes him to the Tiger stadium just across the street, where there is a bronze statue of him standing by the entrance.

Not in the mood? Mike VI has refused to leave his enclosure to go to LSU matches across the street 

Settled at home: Here the nine-year-old appears more comfortable in his 15,000-square-foot enclosure

Traditionally, nine-year-old Mike is driven around the stadium as cheerleaders perform their routine on top of his trailer.

He is then stationed by the opposing team's locker room, roaring menacingly as they emerge onto the pitch.

But it seems he may have had enough - and has also chewed up the LSU sign in his habitat.

Fans are distraught, with many calling and writing to LSU executives with suggestions.

Dr David Baker, the univeristy's director of lab animals and Mike VI's vet, defensively rebuffed the criticism, telling USA Today: 'Cat people know that cats do what cats are going to do.

'Life is on their terms. You can't force them and we have no way of forcing him. OK? I'll say that again. 

Menacing: Mike is the latest in a dynasty of tigers who instill fear in the opposing team by roaring as they arrive

Ritual: He is normally carted around the Tiger stadium with cheerleaders on his trailer to the delight of fans

Abandoning the team? Mike has also chewed up the LSU sign that used to hang in his habitat over the road

Luxurious: Mike's abode is decked out with a pool, a waterfall, rocks, trees and Italian structures

Living the life: He has a team of vets and carers that routinely check his teeth and pamper his paws

'We have no way of forcing him. We wouldn't if we did. You can't entice them.

'People call me with brilliant ideas. "Put a steak in the trailer!" Oh wow, 20 years we never thought of that. 

'When cats think something is up, they're very wary animals and this is an apex predator. 

'He's a fully mature tiger. He's perfectly normal. They're secretive animals. 

Substitute: Crowds have had to make do with a man in a tiger costume for the last seven games

Help? LSU's coach Les Miles has appealed for four or five slow-moving adults to help get Mike to games

'Why would he ever come out of his night house and get in the trailer? The fact that he ever does amazes me.

'He's exhibiting perfectly normal behavior and that's to stay put. End of story.'

However, LSU coach Les Miles was more reticent, appealing on his weekly radio show for volunteers to help get Mike to matches.

He said they need 'four to five slow-moving adults...to encourage him into the cage'.
