Praise: Sharon Kaur was praised for her work when she met Prime Minister David Cameron at Downing Street on the 16th April 2012

An award-winning businesswoman feted by David Cameron and George Osborne at Downing Street faces charges of assaulting her own sister in front of astonished shoppers.

Sharon Kaur allegedly attacked her younger sister Kulvinder by grabbing her hair from behind, spitting at her and clawing at her face, in what court papers term ‘a beating’.

She will appear before magistrates tomorrow accused of assault.

The alleged attack, which left divorcee Kulvinder, 37, battered and bruised, took place outside an O2 mobile phone shop in Ilford, East London, just a few miles from her home.

As onlookers gathered round, Ms Kaur is said to have run into the crowd, leaving her sister behind.

High-profile entrepreneur Ms Kaur, 46, runs the Sahara Homes care home empire with former West Ham FC chairman Terence Brown.

She is managing director of the company she built from scratch, which focuses on people with learning disabilities.

Ms Kaur visited Mr Cameron in No10 two years ago, along with other members of the Sikh community.

A year earlier, she was pictured with Chancellor George Osborne at another Sikh community gathering.

She was named Businesswoman of the Year at the 2007 Asian Women of Achievement Awards, attended by Cherie Blair and presented by Liz Hurley.

Ms Kaur is highly respected in the Sikh community for extensive charity work, including a five-day trek in the Sahara, which raised more than £12,000 for a children’s hospice in East London. 

Of Indian-Punjabi descent, Ms Kaur was born in Huddersfield and was raised in a pub owned by her mother. 

She
 left school at 15, but later studied for a media degree while working 
as a dress designer. She went on to appear in an Indian version of The X
 Factor for TV’s Sikh Channel.

Ms Kaur found her vocation when an aunt asked her to help out in a care home.

She later bought a four-bedroom house with a bank loan, lived in one bedroom and used the other rooms to house three women who had been abused in childhood.

But she has admitted the care industry has had its challenging moments.

In an earlier interview, she said:  ‘I have had service users [care home residents] break my nose, tear my hair out, damage my jaw and I have been dragged around the streets of East London until being rescued by my brother and the police.’

Ms Kaur confirmed she will appear at Barkingside Magistrates’ Court in East London, saying: ‘That’s right, but I don’t see what the big deal is.’

Her sister was unavailable for comment.
