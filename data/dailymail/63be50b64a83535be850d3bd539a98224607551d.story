To a generation of children, he is the man who can fix just about anything.

But now Bob the Builder has had a refurbishment of his own – and not all viewers are too keen on the result.

Animators have created a revamped version of the classic children's television character to star in the new series, broadcast on Channel 5.

But fans took to Twitter last night to criticise the new 'Bob', saying he looked like he might 'overcharge for work', 'drink Carling' or even 'vote Ukip'.

Bob the Builder has had a refurbishment of his own for the new series, but not all viewers are too keen on the result, with some saying he  looked like he might 'overcharge for work', 'drink Carling' or  'vote Ukip'

Bob, whose catchphrase is 'Can we fix it – yes we can!' is a friendly building contractor with a gang of anthropomorphised work-vehicles.

The catchphrase is the title of the show's theme song, which was a million-selling number one hit in the UK in 2000.

After his makeover by toymaker Mattel this year, he now appears younger, slimmer and taller – with a freckly face and big brown eyes.

He has also ditched the old denim dungarees for more fashionable slim-fit jeans, a short-sleeved checked shirt and a sports watch.

And in comparison to the portly, middle-aged version created in 1998, the new Bob is computer-generated rather than made in stop-frame animation.

Bob also has a new home in the bustling metropolis of Spring City, and will use a computer for his building designs, although he will still be seen working at his yard in the village of Fixham.

The series, which was created by CGI animation and was first shown on CBBC and later Nick Jr, will now be shown under Channel 5's 'Milkshake' banner.

Makers of the show said the new version retained the 'emotional warmth' of the original but die-hard fans reacted with anger on Twitter.

Alexandra Tate-Smith said: 'What the hell has happened to Bob the Builder?! A makeover does not suit him.'

John Hinde said: 'Oh Dear.. Bob the Builder's changed a bit!'

Danny Farrell said: 'What have they done to Bob The Builder? No one is gonna watch it now that's the worst makeover ever.'

Maria McAveety said: 'They've broken Bob the builder! The new one is rubbish. Can they fix it?'

Steven Ecott said: 'New Bob the Builder looks like he drinks Carling and votes UKIP.'

A viewer calling themselves Toe Knee said: 'The new Bob the Builder looks like the type that overcharges for his work.'

Actor Lee Ingleby, who is starring in BBC1 drama Our Zoo, takes over from Neil Morrissey, who played the handyman from his launch a decade and a half ago.

Also joining the series when it airs next year will be Downton Abbey's Joanne Froggatt - playing Bob's business partner Wendy - and Inbetweeners star Blake Harrison who voices the digger Scoop.

Ingleby - also known for his role as Stan Shunpike in Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban - said: 'I was very excited to be given the opportunity to be the voice of such a well-loved character. My little nephew is such a huge fan of Bob that I had to jump at the chance. Capturing a child's imagination is so important, and I just wish I was half as good at DIY as Bob is.'

Christopher Kennan, executive producer of HIT Entertainment, the firm behind Bob, said: 'While the new series retains the emotional warmth that has always given Bob The Builder a firm place in the hearts of young viewers, it's now packed with more humour than ever before.'
