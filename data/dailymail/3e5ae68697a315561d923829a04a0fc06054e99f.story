A family seeking compensation for a cancelled easyJet flight were outraged after the airline sent their solicitor a foul-mouthed email.

An employee wrote the note to lawyers acting for father and daughter Chris and Megan Dickson, who were claiming a payout.

Sent from the company’s head office, it explained that the family’s request had been rejected. 

Chris and Megan Dickson were left outraged after easyJet sent their solicitor a foul-mouthed email when they attempted to claim compensation for a cancelled flight 

But astonishingly it concluded: ‘Based on the aforesaid, we decline your client’s claim for compensation and that is our final statement regarding this case mother*******.’

Mr Dickson, 52, from Falkirk, Stirlingshire, said he was ‘astounded’ when his lawyer informed him of the response.

He made the claim after a flight he intended to take with 16-year-old Megan was cancelled at the last minute.

The pair had planned to travel home via Edinburgh after a visit to London in June. But they were forced to spend an additional night in the capital after the flight was cancelled – apparently because of air traffic control strikes in France. 

Mr Dickson, a health and fitness development manager, managed to claim expenses for the unplanned overnight stay from easyJet, but consulted lawyers about claiming compensation as well.

He enlisted the help of Nick Parkinson, a solicitor at Flight Delays, who contacted easyJet in a bid to claim compensation and ask why the flight was cancelled.    

The email sent to Mr Dickson's solicitor concluded with abusive language. Pictured: How it may have looked

However when lawyer Nick Parkinson contacted easyJet to ask why air traffic control strikes in France would affect an Edinburgh-bound journey, he received the abusive reply.

Mr Parkinson said: ‘They said they will not pay out because the reason it was cancelled was because of an air traffic control strike in France. But we thought, what has that got to do with the flight from London to Scotland?

‘We told them their response was vague, and asked them to explain it properly. It was a standard letter asking simple questions. They didn’t answer any of the questions. The response was dismissive, very evasive.’

He added: ‘Airlines can be difficult to deal with, but we’ve certainly never had a response like that before. Mr Dickson was shocked and appalled that they wouldn’t give a straight answer, let alone the abuse.’

Mr Parkinson said the firm was now considering issuing court proceedings.

He said he had received a call from easyJet this morning in which the airline confirmed it was now going to respond to the letter properly.

Mr Parkinson added: ‘They said they’ve done a full investigation and want to resolve it. We were right to ask the questions.’  

EasyJet has apologised for the email and revealed that the member of staff who sent it has been sacked.

A spokesman said: ‘EasyJet is shocked by how anyone could represent the company in this way.

The airline confirmed the employee who sent the email to Mr Dickson's lawyers had been dismissed (file picture)

'The individual was immediately dismissed as soon as we had investigated the matter. We can only apologise to the recipient and assure them that this isn’t how we treat customers.’

The news comes as easyJet passengers face fresh disruption, with the company’s French cabin attendants planning to walk out over the Christmas period in a dispute over their pay and schedules. 

EasyJet spokesman Francois Bacchetta confirmed that the airline was expecting to cancel less than half its flights from French airports between 12:01am on Christmas Day and 11:59pm on Boxing Day. 

EasyJet apologised to passengers and said it will issue a final cancellation list on Christmas Eve once it has final details from the SNPNC and UNAC cabin crew unions.

Passengers on the affected flights will be contacted and offered a full refund or the opportunity to rebook at no cost, the airline added.
