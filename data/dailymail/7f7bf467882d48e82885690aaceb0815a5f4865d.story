A Michigan man was fatally mauled by two dogs as he jogged along a rural road on Wednesday evening.

Craig Sytsma, 46, of Livonia was attacked by the cane corsos in Metamora Township, about 45 miles northwest of Detroit, authorities in Lapeer County said. He was unconscious when he was taken to a hospital, where he died of his injuries, police said.

The attack was the third since 2012 involving canines from the same property, officials said.

Help: A neighbor reportedly witnessed the attack before he tried to shoot at and scare the dogs off

'He was jogging, doing what everybody else does out there, running and riding bikes,' Metamora Township police Officer Sean Leathers told the Detroit Free Press.

According to police, a man mowing his lawn nearby saw the attack, got a gun and tried to shoot at the animals to chase them off.

In Michigan, a person may face involuntary manslaughter or other charges in such an attack. The county prosecutor's office is expected to review the case.

The dogs, previously identified as bull mastiffs, were quarantined at the Lapeer County Animal Shelter. Sheriff's Detective Jason Parks told the Detroit Free Press the dogs' 45-year-old owner brought them in and authorities will seek to have the dogs destroyed.

Sytsma was a 'a divorced father of three' and 'had apparently decided to jog after leaving work,' the newspaper reported.

WXYZ reported that Sytsma survived a battle with colon cancer last year.

'He was very competitive,' said friend Mark Raitanen who knew him for 23 years and spoke to the Detroit Free Press.

Raitanen said he jogged, played hockey, and golfed, as well as regularly riding his mountain bike and playing beach volley ball.

A huge music fan who was partial to Santana, the Allman Brothers, and Gov't Mule, he went to several shows a year but still listened to cassette tapes.

But more than anything he was a family man who cherished his children Tyra, 16, Jordan, 23, and Luis, 28.

'He was a dad, he was a family man,' Raitanen said.

Son Jordan said that while his father fought cancer at the age of 23, he would rarely speak of it. 

'I’d
 say, ‘I’m here for you, Pop,’ but I wouldn‘t ask questions,' Jordan 
Sytsma said.

In May 2012, there was a report of a 
dog bite where the animal returned to the same property, Metamora 
Township Police Chief David Mallett told The Flint Journal. And in November 2013, a man was taken to a hospital after being bitten by a dog that returned to the address.

Mallett told the newspaper he didn't know whether the same dog or dogs were involved.

The dogs 'get loose kind of regularly,' Geoffrey Petz told the Flint Journal.

'I've had interactions where I was walking out of my grandma's pole barn and there was a dog standing there with its hair standing up, growling at you,' he told the newspaper. 'When you get that feeling, you can see it in an animal if it's scared or aggressive and you just back right back into the door.'

Oxford resident April Smith told the Free Press, however, that one of the dogs involved on Wednesday attacked her in May 2012. Smith said she and her sister were walking two dogs when she was bitten. She said she was horrified that the owner still had the dogs.

'It's just crazy to me,' Smith told the newspaper. 'Animal control should have done something. It should have never gone this far. The fact this has led to a death, it's sickening.'

Some people in past dog attacks in Michigan have been charged. A Livingston County woman whose American bulldogs in September 2007 fatally mauled two people, including a 91-year-old man, was sentenced to prison in 2008. She pleaded no contest to two felony counts of keeping dangerous animals causing death and a misdemeanor charge of allowing her dogs to stray.
