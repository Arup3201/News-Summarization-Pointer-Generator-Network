David Cameron enraged Tory rebels last night by striking a late deal with Labour to prevent his own MPs wrecking gay marriage legislation.

The Prime Minister backed Labour’s calls for an immediate consultation on the future of civil partnerships once gay marriages are legalised.

This could either lead to them being extended to heterosexual couples or scrapped totally.

Concerns: Prime Minister David Cameron had faced warnings that the Tory party was at risk of tearing itself apart over gay marriage and Europe

Despite the opposition of half the 
Tory backbenchers, the 11th-hour deal, a humiliation for the PM, means 
same-sex marriages could take place next summer.

Mr Cameron’s reliance on Labour to force the measure through highlighted his divisions with his backbenchers. Gay marriage has become the latest in a series of issues sparking friction between the PM and traditionalist Tories.

The legislation had looked to be in 
serious trouble yesterday as Labour threatened to vote to introduce 
civil partnerships for straight couples as well – a move which critics 
said could cost the Exchequer £4billion by extending pension rights and 
inheritance tax breaks.

Tory rebels were backing the move in an attempt to wreck the entire Bill. 

But the Government, which had 
previously suggested it would review civil partnerships within five 
years, headed off a potential defeat by agreeing to a consultation 
immediately.

Sources said the review would be ‘very thorough and very, very long’.

In the Commons, Tory splits were 
highlighted by a clash between Sir Gerald Howarth and Margot James, the 
Tories’ only openly gay woman MP.

Miss James, welcoming the legislation,
 said many gay people had suffered abuse and anti-discrimination 
legislation was needed to protect them.

But Sir Gerald replied: ‘I fear that 
the playing field has not been levelled. I believe that the pendulum is 
now swinging so far the other way and there are plenty in the aggressive
 homosexual community who see this as but a stepping stone to something 
even further.’

Veteran Tory Edward Leigh protested: 
‘If you dare disagree with the orthodoxy that gay marriage is the best 
thing since sliced bread, you are breaking a new taboo.’

He suggested that the ‘outlandish views of the loony left of the 1980s have now become embedded in high places’.

‘What the Government is refusing to 
recognise is that they are not legislating this Bill to redefine 
marriage in a vacuum.

'They are legislating in a culture which has been 
so coloured by political correctness that mild-mannered people 
expressing reasonable beliefs in moderate tones are treated like 
villains,’ he added.

Yvette Cooper, shadow home secretary, 
revealed that Labour would withdraw its support from the amendment 
tabled by Tory opponents of gay marriage.

She said: ‘We know David 
Cameron’s leadership is too weak to be able to push this through and to 
be able to get support on his own benches.

'We think that is a serious 
problem. But also we don’t want to see gay couples who are desperate to 
set the date and get married at the mercy of this Tory infighting.’

Last night Cabinet ministers Iain 
Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson voted with the rebels who were calling 
for registrars to opt-out of performing same sex marriages.

The change 
was rejected by a majority of 190 but attracted the support of 150.

Tory MP David Burrowes warned the 
legislation would become a charter for unfair dismissal of opponents and
 said it would unleash a ‘chill wind’ for those who back  ‘traditional 
marriage’.

In a second vote, 148 MPs supported an
 amendment to protect the religious beliefs of a person who believes 
that marriage is defined as being between a man and a woman. 349 MPs 
voted against, meaning it was defeated by 201 votes.

In a third vote, 163 MPs  supported an
 amendment to  protect those who opposed gay marriage from 
discrimination. But 321 MPs voted against, meaning it was defeated by 
158 votes.

A group of more than 30 current and 
former local party chairmen has written to the Prime Minister to warn 
him the legislation will drive Tory voters to UKIP.

Bob Woollard, 
chairman of the Conservative Grassroots group, said: ‘Same-sex marriage 
is really a tipping point – a bellwether issue if you like. People have 
just said, “I’ve had enough, I’m off, I will never vote Conservative 
again”.’

A YouGov poll says 54 per cent support
 same-sex marriage, but revealed a deep generational split. Under 40s 
back the idea by three to one, but over 60s are two to one against.
