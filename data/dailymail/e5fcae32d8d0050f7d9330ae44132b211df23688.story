The iconic bi-plane flown by Robert Redford's character in the Oscar-winning film 'Out of Africa' is expected to fetch £120,000 when it goes under the hammer early next year.

The 1929 De Havilland Gipsy Moth bi-plane was flown by Redford's character Denys Finch Hatton in the seven-time Oscar-winning 1985 picture.

It will go on sale at the Grand Palais in Paris on February 6 and bidding is expected to top £120,000.

Back in the day: Redford (left) with Meryl Streep in the aeroplane which will be auctioned in January, in a still from the 1985 classic

The yellow aircraft, which is 24ft (7.3m) long, 9ft (2.7m) high and has a 30ft wingspan, is capable of a maximum speed of 105mph. 

The DH-60 Moth - complete with it's registration G-AAMY - is still in superb condition and comes with a permit to fly.

In the 80s love-story - directed by 
Sydney Pollack - the plane is piloted by Redford over the Kenyan 
savannah during a four-minute long romantic scene with Karen Blixen, 
played by Meryl Streep.

It 
is one of the most fondly recalled scenes in film history, with the pair
flying over the beautiful scenery and through the clouds.

Still got it: The plabne, which is in top top shape and has a license to fly can travel up to speeds of 105mph

Love story: The Sydney Pollack directed film sees Redford's character Denys crash the plane to find Streep's Karen

Streep reaches backwards and Redford takes her hand, perfectly set to John Barry's superb beautiful score.

In the film, Denys is tragically 
killed when he crashes the plane as flies to be with Karen after she 
loses her livelihood and her marriage during the film.

Bonhams auctioneers are handling the sale.

A spokesman said: 'We are delighted to be returning to 
the Grand Palais in Paris in 2013, where the Motor Car, Motorcycle and 
Automobilia departments will combine with the 20th Century Decorative 
Arts department to conduct a series of sales.'
