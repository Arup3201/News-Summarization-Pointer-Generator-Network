We know London was the capital of fashion in the Swinging Sixties.

But, judging from the garments on show at a new exhibition at the Queen's Gallery, Buckingham Palace, the capital was also top of the style league 300 years ago.

Though the 1660s were a dark time with deadly plague and the Great Fire destroying huge parts of the capital, it was also a period when haute couture reigned on the streets as much as the Stuart monarchs did from their palaces.

If only they'd had a cat walk: Anne of Denmark and Queen Henrietta Maria

The exhibition, at Buckingham Palace, celebrates an age when heaving cleavage and discrete beauty spots were a must for every female, and even the smartest man had no trouble sporting swirls of flouncy lace.

It features more than 60 portraits of monarchs from the Tudor and Stuart eras juxtaposed with sculpture, jewellery and even some rare clothing from the era to examine the fashions of the time.

The exhibition opens with familiar portraits of Henry VIII and his three kids, but nearby panels focus on their impressive and symbolic clothing. Princess Elizabeth, considered illegitimate at the time of this painting, is wearing the most regal of gold-threaded silks below her rich, crimson gown.

To reflect the first fashion publications that emerged in the reign of Charles II, The Royal Collection Trust has published Robe, a glossy fashion magazine set in May 1667, and has invited comments from modern-day fashionistas.

It looks at topical fashion quandaries of the day such as the best ways to wear pearls, whether to decorate gloves with embroidery or ribbons and how to cover up smallpox scars.

Victims of the Great Fire are told how best to restock smoke-damaged wardrobes and there is an essential guide to those alluring, painted face patches.

Asked about female fashion inspired by male attire, TV presenter Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen says: “Women look silly in codpieces… but strangely men can look sensational in lacy drawers.”

Exhibition curator Anna Reynolds of the Royal Collection Trust says: “Fashion was hugely important. The rich and powerful used clothing to send messages about taste and status.”

Regal: Mary of Modena, when Duchess of York, and a portrait of an unknown woman

Stern but stylish: Mary I cuts a handsome figure in this flattering ensemble

Dainty: These embroidered gloves, circa 1595-1605, are rather fetching
