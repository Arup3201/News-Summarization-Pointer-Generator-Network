 Elian Gonzalez, the Cuban boy who survived a perilous raft journey that killed his mother and became a symbol of troubled relations between the United States and Cuba has left the country for the first time since he was a little boy.

Gonzalez who turned 20 on Friday  traveled to Quito, Ecuador, as part of a 200-member Cuban delegation to a week-long youth conference there.

Gonzalez recently said in an interview published in Cuba's state-run media that his fame continues to follow him in Cuba.

All grown up: Elian Gonzalez, the little boy who was the focus of a bitter international custody dispute after he was rescued at sea as a child, left Cuba on Friday for the first time since 2000

Cuban shipwreck survivor Elian Gonzalez: Gonzalez is now studying to become a military officer. He turned into an international child celebrity after he was found floating off the Florida coast when he was five-years-old in November 1999

'Wherever I go there's always a child, an old woman that comes to me and wants to meet me,' he said. 'Not because I am famous but because they suffered with my family.'

'Fidel Castro for me is like a father,'Gonzalez said in the recent interview. 'I don't profess to have any religion but if I did my God would be Fidel Castro. He is like a ship that knew to take his crew on the right path.'

In an interview with the Cuban weekly Girón published on the cubadebate.cu website, Elian, said his experience in Miami when he was six 'charged me for life.'

Speaking in his native Spanish, he said his basic rights as a child — 'the right to be with my father, the right to maintain my nationality and remain in my cultural context' — were violated in the United States.

'Those days were very sad for me, which marked me for life', González said Monday. 'It never gave me the chance to think of my mother, who died at sea as a result of the Cuban Adjustment Act,' he said, referring to the 1966 U.S. law that allows any Cuban who reaches the U. S. by any means to be paroled and given residency.

Havana has called the law 'murderous' and blamed it for encouraging Cubans to board rickety boats to cross the Florida Straits in the hopes of reaching the U.S. González said he “suffered the consequences of the act.'

But he emphasized that “our struggle is not against the American people; it is against their government.' He said. 'From the moment Americans knew of my case, they took to the streets to call for me to be sent back to my country.'

Now a military cadet studying industrial engineering, Gonzalez said he would have suffered had he stayed in the United States.

Fondness: Fidel Castro for me is like a father,'Gonzalez said in the recent interview. 'I don't profess to have any religion but if I did my God would be Fidel Castro. He is like a ship that knew to take his crew on the right path'

The moment: Elian Gonzalez, held by Donato Dalrymple, is taken by U.S. federal agents from his Miami relatives April 22, 2000. U.S. federal authorities stormed the Miami house where Cuban shipwreck survivor Elian Gonzalez was sleeping

He was shy of his sixth birthday on Thanksgiving Day 1999 when a fisherman found him off the coast of Florida, clinging to an inner tube after his mother and nine others fleeing Cuba drowned trying to reach American soil.

He was taken to live with relatives in Miami but his father, Juan Miguel, who was separated from his mother and had remained on the island, demanded that the boy be sent back, saying Elian was taken without his consent.

The dispute turned into a headline-grabbing international custody battle that weighed heavy on the 2000 presidential race between George W. Bush and Al Gore.

Fidel Castro threw the weight of the Cuban government behind the case, mobilizing seven months of massive demonstrations calling for Gonzalez's repatriation.

As the two sides fought out the high-profile case in court, U.S. immigration officials decided to put Gonzalez in the custody of his father, who had come to the United States to argue for Elian's return.

His relatives in Miami refused to go along, and armed federal agents then raided the home of Gonzalez's uncle and seized the boy.

It was one of the few moments since 1959 when the Cold War rivals agreed on something: The U.S. legal system ruled that Gonzalez should be returned to his father.A state celebration was held on the 10th anniversary of his return to Cuba.
