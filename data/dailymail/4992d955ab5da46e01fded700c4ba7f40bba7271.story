The Chelsea Supporters Trust have called for the introduction of safe standing areas to improve the atmosphere at Stamford Bridge.

Blues manager Jose Mourinho last month criticised the home support, claiming that playing a match at Stamford Bridge felt as though they were playing in an empty stadium.

And a survey of 660 members backed Mourinho's assessment, listing the ways they feel the stale atmosphere at the Bridge can be improved.

Other than safe standing, the survey revealed 'the desire for more affordable ticket pricing especially for younger supporters (which in turn would help the atmosphere).'

Members also believe that a solution to the atmosphere concerns would be to reduce the amount of overzealous stewarding on a matchday. 

Tim Rolls, chair of the Chelsea Supporters Trust, said in a statement: 'The results of the second CST members survey reinforce the view of the board that there are a couple of fundamental issues the club need to address as a matter of urgency.

'The recent publicity following the manager's comments about the lack of atmosphere at Stamford Bridge led to a healthy debate about the reasons for this. 

'The need for more affordable ticketing for young supporters, the desire for safe standing to be introduced and concerns about over-zealous stewarding are all highlighted as significant member concerns in the survey results, and support the CST board view on these matters.'

Chelsea face West Brom at home on Saturday, their first match at Stamford Bridge since Mourinho's damning assessment.
