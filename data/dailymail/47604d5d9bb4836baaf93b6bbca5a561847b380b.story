A motorist tried to drive home from a court which had just banned him from driving.

A stunned police officer saw 29-year-old Kieron Pemberton getting into his car moments after magistrates in Wigan, Greater Manchester, had revoked his licence.

He chased Pemberton, pulled him over and arrested him, hauling him back before the same court - where he was promptly jailed for 12 weeks.

'Stupid': Kieron Pemberton, 29, tried to drive home from a court which had just banned him from driving

Wigan and Leigh Magistrates' Court had previously banned Pemberton for 14 months for failing to provide a breath sample to police.

Driving ban hearings usually include a direct warning to motorists not to take their cars home.

But after the short hearing, a police officer who had been in court saw Pemberton leave the building, get into his car and start the engine.

Mike Ardern, prosecuting, told magistrates: 'When he left the court, the officer was 
exiting the nearby supermarket and saw him walking and holding a car 
key.

'Mr Pemberton opened the driverâ€™s door and drove.

'The officer pulled in front of him, got out and pointed out to him he had just been disqualified and then arrested him.'

No escape: Pemberton was promptly hauled back before Wigan and Leigh Magistrates' Court and jailed

Defence: Pemberton's lawyer insisted he was only trying to take the car home so he could put it up for sale

Yesterday Pemberton, from Wigan, was jailed for 12 weeks after he admitted driving while disqualified.

Andrew Stock, defending, said Pemberton, from Wigan, got behind the wheel to take the car back to his address where it would be sold.

'If he could take that decision back he would do,' said Mr Stock.

'It was a foolish and stupid thing to do. It is something that with the benefit of hindsight would never have happened.

'There was a complete lack of foresight which led to a decision he wishes he could take back.'

Pemberton will serve half of the sentence in prison and half on supervision.
