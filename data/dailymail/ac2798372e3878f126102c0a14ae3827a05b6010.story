The president of an upstate New York college has apologized for the rowdy behavior of football fans that led to the arrests of more than two dozen people in central New York.

Erik J. Bitterbaum, president of the State University at Cortland, issued the apology a day after a large crowd turned unruly in downtown Cortland.

Earlier Saturday, Cortland defeated Ithaca 28-24 in the annual Cortaca Jug game.

'As the president of SUNY Cortland, I would like to personally apologize to the Cortland community for the inexcusable behavior of some of our students related to Saturday's football game with Ithaca College,' college President Erik J. Bitterbaum said in a prepared statement in reaction to what happened after the Cortaca game.

'Please be assured that the College will work closely with city officials to implement measures intended to prevent this type of activity from occurring again,' Bitterbaum wrote.

The Cortaca Jug game is part of a longstanding football rivalry between SUNY Cortland and Ithaca College. Cortland won this year's game by four points. The game was held Saturday in Ithaca.

The rivalry game draws thousands of students, alumni and other fans to central New York, where the two colleges are just 20 miles apart.

Misconduct: Thousands of people shut down streets, threw bottles and furniture and even tipped over at least one car

Intoxicated: Only 19 of the 80 arrests were current SUNY Cortland students. Catalano says the other 61 were mainly alumni and others from out of town

Plastered: While posts on Facebook and Twitter may have helped perpetuate the near riot, the chief says those pictures and videos may also help lead to more arrests

The annual Cortaca game is a time-honored athletic tradition that SUNY Cortland and its alumni take great pride in,' Bitterbaum said in the statement. 'Unfortunately, as we all saw Saturday, the athletic contest has become secondary to the celebration for some students, guests and visitors to the community. As an institution dedicated to academic and athletic excellence we are determined to turn this destructive culture around.'

Cortland police say about 30 people had been arrested by Saturday night. State troopers had to be called in to help restore order.

Bitterbaum apologized to the community for what he called 'the inexcusable behavior of some of our students.'

On the lookout: Police say they have lots of video coverage and if there are subsequent arrests they can make as a result of the footage, then they will do so

Outnumbered: The police were eventually so overrun by the sheer number of students they had to stop arresting people

Police described large crowds that got so big that officers had to stop arresting people and focus on controlling the crowd and restoring order. State police also were called to help.

Bitterbaum also said he's been talking to other top college officials to discuss options about what could be done when the event is held in town in the future. 'Together, we will consider any and all ideas as we move forward,' he wrote.

'SUNY Cortland takes pride in maintaining a positive, mutually beneficial relationship with its neighbors and the surrounding community,' Bitterbaum wrote.

'Several years ago, collaboration between the College and the city allowed us to stop the destructive Clayton Avenue block party that used to occur every spring. We are confident we can have a similar impact on the unruly celebrations surrounding Cortaca.'

Overwhelmed: Students flooded the streets in a celebration that resulted in nearly three dozen people being arrested

Chaos: Several thousand people were in the streets Saturday to celebrate the 55th annual Cortaca Jug game between Ithaca College and the State University of New York at Cortland. The streets were littered with beer cans and plastic cups
