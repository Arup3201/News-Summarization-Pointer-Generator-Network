Tom Cruise stayed at the Marriott Hotel in Peterborough, where a staff member who did not recognise him, asked if he had a loyalty card

He may be renowned for his role as a secret agent in the Mission Impossible series - but it seems Tom Cruise took it to a new level while staying at the Marriott Hotel in Peterborough.

And launching his own mission - called Operation Fromage - left one member of staff red-faced after he failed to recognise the Hollywood star and asked him if he had a loyalty card.

The 52-year-old, who had been in the Cambridgeshire city to film his next Mission Impossible movie, was reportedly eating breakfast when the waiter made the blunder.

Cruise and co-star Simon Pegg, 44, were filming at nearby RAF Wittering where the actor was suspended from an Airbus A400M at 5,000ft.

He had checked into the hotel with production staff for five nights under the name Operation Fromage, which is French for cheese, after the close-by village of Stilton, according to The Sun.

A source, speaking to the newspaper about the waiter's gaffe, said: 'Tom took it in good jest, but given the security operation to keep his and Simon's stay under wraps it was funny no one seemed to bat an eyelid.' 

It also reports that Cruise and Pegg were spotted by locals, including a group of salesmen, who were shocked to see the action star. 

Last Monday the Oscar nominee was filming one of the action scenes for Mission Impossible 5 scene where he fought his way across a four-engine military aircraft at the Royal Air Force station.

The Top Gun actor had been insistent on performing his own stunts throughout the movie, but the crew were making a realistic effort of reenacting the combat scene from a safe, stationary position.

Chris McQuarrie, the movie's director was on set in Peterborough last weekend and admitted that the cast and crew were contending with serious rain.

The Jack Reacher director has been keeping an #MI5diary on Twitter and tweeted: 'Sincerest thanks to everyone at RAF Wittering, Pilot Ed Strongman and team #Airbus.'

The Peterborough Marriott Hotel is about a 15 minute drive from the air base where filming took place.

The Marriott loyalty card offers members the opportunity to earn points for their stays as well as offering benefits like free wifi, room upgrades and extra towels.

Staff from the chain have so far declined to comment.
