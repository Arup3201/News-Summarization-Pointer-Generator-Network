Credit behemoths Visa and Mastercard were scrambling yesterday to track down the third party processor that stole credit card data from as many as ten million customers.

The stolen data has now been linked to a New York City taxicab or parking-garage company, which has access to millions of credit card numbers.

Experts are now imploring anyone who has ridden in a New York taxi or parked in a garage within the metropolitan area to check their credit card statements or contact their financial institution.

According to Avivah Litan, a security analyst at Gartner Research, thieves have been stockpiling the information for months.

Ripe for the taking: Analysts believe credit card data was collected from a New York City taxi firm

Pay day: Every New York taxi comes equipped with a credit card machine; many riders find it easier to pay with credit than dealing with cash

'From what I hear, the breach 
involves a taxi and parking garage company in the New York City area, so
 if you’ve paid a NYC cab in the last few months with your credit or 
debit card — be sure to check your card statements for possible fraud,’ 
she said yesterday.

'Those transactions are aggregated' 
and sent to a server, Ms Litan said. 'It has a lot of hops along the 
way' before the card information reaches a processor.

She believes the data is already being used on the street by identity thieves.

She wrote on her blog: 'I’ve spoken 
with folks in the card business who are seeing signs of this breach 
mushroom. Looks like the hackers have started using the stolen card data
 more recently.

She also said that unverified reports
 point to a 'Central American gang that broke into the company's system 
by answering the application's knowledge-based authentication questions 
correctly.

'Looks like the hackers took over an administrative account that was not protected sufficiently.’

Investigation: Mastercard and Visa are said to have notified all of their customers of the security breach

According to blog Krebs on Security, 
which first reported the embarrassing security breach, the stolen data 
can be used to create duplicate cards.

The U.S. Secret Service is now investigating a major cyber intrusion at an Atlanta-based payment processor that could expose millions of MasterCard, Visa, American Express and Discover cardholders to fraudulent charges.

Processor Global Payments Inc said on Friday it had found 'unauthorized access' into its system early in March and notified law enforcement and financial institutions.

Payment network operators MasterCard Inc, Visa Inc , American Express Co and Discover Financial Services confirmed they were affected, along with banks and other franchises that issue cards bearing their logos.

debit card, be sure to check your card statements for possible fraud.'

A spokesman for the Secret Service said the agency is leading investigations into the case but declined to give any details.

The companies notified
 U.S. banks of a potential security breach, and they are now going 
through the process of pinpointing the affected accounts before 
contacting customers involved.

Customers are urged to check their accounts online or contact their financial institution regarding any concerns they have.

Visa have already provided the issuing 
banks with the affected account numbers and assured customers they would
 not be responsible for fraudulent purchases.

The companies, which are the two largest 
global credit card processors, said the issue stemmed from a third-party
 vendor, reportedly Global Payments, and not their own internal systems.

Atlanta-based company Global Payments are being named as the third party processor where the breach occurred.

Following the news, shares of the company were halted after dropping more than 9.1 per cent.

Global Payments said it had 'identified and self-reported unauthorized access into a portion of its processing system' and had determined in early March that the intruders might have gained access to credit-card data.

Theft: MasterCard confirmed they are currently investigating a potential account data compromise event of a U.S.-based entity

Though millions of U.S. cardholders could be affected, it does not necessarily mean their cards were used fraudulently but that the cardholder's information was accessed.

Mastercard said in a statement: 
'MasterCard is concerned whenever there is any possibility that cardholders could be inconvenienced and we continue to both monitor this event and take steps to safeguard account information.

'If cardholders have any concerns about their individual accounts, they should contact their issuing financial institution.'

Visa also released a statement saying their customers were victims of data theft, but said its own systems were not hacked.

'Visa Inc is aware of a potential data compromise incident at a third party entity affecting card account information from all major card brands.

'Visa has provided payment card issuers with the affected account numbers so they can take steps to protect consumers through independent fraud monitoring and, if needed, reissuing cards.'

Brian Krebs, left, reported that Mastercard and Visa were contacting their customers about the breach and Avivah 
Litan, right, security analyst at Gartner Research, said there are signs the data is already being used by thieves 

Once a person swipes their credit card to pay, the transaction then is sent through
 a chain of processing.

First they are aggregated and sent to a server before the card information reaches a processor for authorization.

The processor then sends the authorization request to the bank who check the details (if it is a legitimate account and if there is enough money to cover charge) and then confirm the authorization back to the processor.

The current breach is believed to have occurred at the central 
aggregation point where card information is calculated.

The companies' statements came after the blog Krebs on Security reported
 that MasterCard and Visa Inc have been alerting banks across the U.S. 
about a 'massive' breach that may affect more than ten million 
cardholders.

He told Technology Live: 'Law enforcement asked everyone to keep 
it quiet so as not to disturb investigations.

'I'm hearing
 now from two sources that investigators suspect Dominican street gangs 
may be involved and that the fraud is focusing mostly on commercial 
credit and debit card accounts.'

Thousands of U.S. banks that issue credit and debit cards receive daily 
alerts regarding breaches through a system referred to as CAMS, said 
Thomas McCrohan, an analyst with Janney Capital Markets.

Once a person swipes a card to pay, the transaction then is sent through
 a chain of processing.

The Visa-Mastercard breach is the first major instance this year of 
consumer information put at risk by technological flaws or hacking.
