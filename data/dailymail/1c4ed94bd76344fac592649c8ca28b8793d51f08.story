It is a sight not seen in Britain for six centuries.

The last time storks bred in the wild here was in Edinburgh in 1416, when the Hundred Years War was raging and Henry V had just defeated the French at Agincourt.

These four-year-old birds have built their huge nest on an 18th-century chimney at Thrigby Hall Wildlife Gardens near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk.

They have been spotted mating and experts believe the female could lay her eggs within the next few days.

Estate director Ken Sims said: ‘The building of a nest together is part of their courtship display and an indication that eggs are on their way.

‘They were seen copulating around five days ago and we think they were doing it a couple of days either side as well.

‘We
 are pretty confident we will get some young storks. It could be that 
eggs have been laid already but we can’t see as the chimney is too 
high.’

Storks usually breed in the warmer parts of Continental Europe and spend their winters in Africa.

Some occasionally visit the UK in Spring but only around 20 are spotted each year.

The birds have been bred in zoos here but their wings are pinioned to stop them flying away, which also prevents them building nests in the lofty positions they prefer - often on man-made structures such as rooftops and telegraph poles.

The pair in Great Yarmouth were bred in captivity in Cumbria and the Cotswolds and were bought as chicks by Mr Sims, who has a policy of not clipping their wings to allow them more freedom.

He added: ‘They are resident at the wildlife gardens but they can fly and they are allowed their semi-liberty.

‘They go off into the countryside and the Norfolk Broads to feed and they come back here. We gave the storks a helping hand by building a structure for their nest on the hall’s front chimney.

'But they turned their backs on our handiwork and have built their own nest on one of the rear stacks.

‘We attempted to encourage stork breeding in 2008 but sadly the hen disappeared and the male stork flew into a power line and died.

‘We are hoping for more success this time. It will be a day for celebration if our storks manage to breed successfully in the traditional way.’ 

RSPB spokesman Richard James said he was looking forward to the prospect of the birds producing chicks, although he was still waiting for a pair born in the wild to mate.

He added: ‘Storks visit the UK quite regularly although only a handful come every year.

‘The main reason that they have not bred here for hundreds of years is that there are never enough for them to pair up.’
