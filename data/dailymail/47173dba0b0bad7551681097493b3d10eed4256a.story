Manuel Pellegrini distanced himself from speculation linking Manchester City with a £30million move for Southampton left back Luke Shaw and insisted he was fully focused on reaching a century of goals when Cardiff City visit the Etihad Stadium.

Asked about reported interest in Shaw, the City manager asked ‘which player?’ before adding: ‘No, no, no. I don’t confirm about any names because we are not concerned about that in this moment.

'We are just thinking about Cardiff tomorrow and not in the winter transfer window. During the whole of January we will see what happens, all the clubs can do transfers, but I am not interested in one name especially. I don’t say nothing about it.

‘Is Joleon Lescott leaving? I repeat exactly the same answer, I am not talking about transfers at this moment because it is not our priority.

‘We will try to do a good game against Cardiff for the fans. So far we are doing that but every game is different. I remember that Cardiff lost against Arsenal in minutes 88 and 90 in London so we are not thinking that we have an easy game tomorrow.

'We are trying to win and if we can win with more goals, it is better, but it is very important to do a very balanced game.’

Asked about the problems caused by set-pieces in his side’s defeat at Cardiff at the start of the season, Pellegrini said: ‘We always prepare for set-pieces. In every match, not only in our match, it is very important every week for all the teams. We will try tomorrow to concentrate a lot and not allow them to have an advantage at set-pieces.

‘It is great that Alvaro Negredo, Edin Dzeko and Sergio Aguero are all in a great moment. Of course, it is better for the manager to have different choices to select.

'They are three important players, Negredo and Dzeko are doing really well, and Sergio is coming back from an important injury so the three are very useful for us in this moment.

‘We will see tomorrow the 11 starters. Sergio is in the squad list. He is coming from a long injury, he played just 20 minutes the other day. We will see which is the best way for him to continue in the next games.

‘Can we score 100 goals in the Premier League? It is always difficult to know what will happen in the future. We will try to play every game as a final and we will try to score the most amount of goals in every game but it is very difficult to know what will happen in the future.

‘We lost at Cardiff, but I don’t agree  things were not so very good for me in only the second game of the year. When we lost against Cardiff and after when we lost against Aston Villa, we were playing in the right way and we will continue playing exactly the same because you can lose the match but I think we didn’t play bad those games.

'It is very important to have the trust to continue in the same  way and now we hope we can finish the year with an important achievement.’
