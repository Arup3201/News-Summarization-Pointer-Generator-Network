Washington police they have found the body of a man who appears to have committed suicide in a park where officers were searching for missing 8-year-old girl Relisha Rudd.

Police Chief Cathy Lanier did not immediately identify the man, whose body was found Monday, with the possibility that it is Kahlil Tatum, the last person with whom Relisha was seen.

She would also not comment on his race.

Investigators found the man’s body in an area they have been searching since last week near Kenilworth Park and Aquatic Gardens.

Scene: Police have been searching Kenilworth Park Aquatic Gardens in Washington DC for Relisha Rudd. On Monday they found the body of an adult man

Police descended on the 700-acre area last Thursday 
after information led them to believe Mr. Tatum had gone to the area 
shortly after purchasing a carton of large 42-gallon garbage bags the 
day after Relisha was last seen.

Tatum, 51, has been missing since his wife was found fatally shot in an Oxon Hill motel.

Police
 from Prince George’s County, where Mr. Tatum faces a first-degree 
murder charge in connection with his wife’s death, also sent officers to
 the park where the body was found.

This wanted poster for Kahlil Malik Tatum was posted after the body of his wife was found in a Maryland hotel. Police say they cannot rule out the possibility Tatum killed Relisha Rudd

Tatum was a janitor at the homeless shelter where she lived with her mother and brothers.

The girl was last seen on March 1.

Only after she was reported missing did police in neighboring Prince George's County, Md., find the body of Tatum's wife in a motel room, with the FBI releasing a nation-wide wanted poster.
