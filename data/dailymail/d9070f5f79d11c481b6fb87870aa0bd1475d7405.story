Alf Webber from the Warton Royal British Legion is pleased that North Warwickshire Council has backed down

Every year since the guns fell silent, the Warton Royal British Legion have honoured their fallen colleagues with a march through the village.

That was until they ran into... an event plan, risk assessment forms, emergency contact details, marshals, traffic management procedures, road closure applications, an evacuation plan and public liability insurance.

The veterans were issued with the extraordinary list after the council ruled they could not hold their annual parade on Remembrance Sunday because they had failed to fill in the correct paperwork.

Instead, officials insisted the veterans would have to replace their proud march on the street to lay wreaths with a stroll along the pavement instead.

Although the list has been withdrawn after a campaign from outraged villagers in Warton, North Warwickshire, the men must still fill in risk assessment forms.

Terry Casey, a former Royal Air Force mechanic and the Legion’s branch secretary, said of the parade, which has been held for more than 80 years: ‘It’s the first year we’ve had to do all this.

‘I didn’t deal with anything like that when I was in the RAF. It is less than five minutes to the memorial.

Then we hold the Act of Remembrance, then it’s a short march back – ten minutes at the most.

‘We’ve been told we have to marshall the event ourselves. But with only seven members, there’d be no one left.’

Legion membership secretary Alf Webber added: ‘I wouldn’t have walked on the footpath,  I’d have walked straight up the road regardless.’ 

A spokesman for the local council said: ‘The parade will go ahead. We’ve offered to help with the risk assessment.’

A spokesman for Warwickshire Police added: ‘We have the highest regard for the Royal British Legion and all those involved in the organisation of the annual events and throughout Warwickshire officers will be joining them on November 11 to pay our respects to those who have lost their lives in conflict.’
