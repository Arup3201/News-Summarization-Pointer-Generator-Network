IHS dismantled the iPad Air to work out how much each component cost to make. The cheapest 16GB iPad Air costs $274 to make, plus a $6 manufacturing cost, yet sells for $499 in the U.S

Apple launched its iPad Air last month, which is twice as
fast as previous models and 20 per cent thinner - yet a new report has now found it’s
also cheaper to make, meaning Apple's profit margins just increased.

Colorado-based analytics firm IHS took the tablet to pieces
and worked out how much each individual component would cost to manufacture.

It discovered the cheapest 16GB Wi-Fi-only iPad Air costs
$274 to make, based on preliminary results, yet sells for $499.

This is despite the fact the iPad Air is $42 cheaper
to make than the third-generation model.

IHS’ Teardown Analysis Service only looked at the price in
dollars.

If the figures are converted to UK prices this works out at £170
production costs compared to a retail price of £399.

Elsewhere, the 16GB iPad Air with 3G connectivity costs £188 ($304)
to make, according to preliminary results, and this represents a 6 per cent drop
in production price of the iPad 3, down from £201 ($325).

When the £4 ($6) manufacturing cost of the iPad Air is added in,
the total cost to make the tablets increases to $280 (£174) for the smaller 16GB model and $310 (£192) for the 32GB device.

‘While the iPad Air slims down in size, the profit margins
are getting fatter,’ said Andrew Rassweiler, senior director, cost benchmarking
services for IHS.

‘Although the Air’s new, ultra-thin display and touch screen
are more expensive than for the third-generation iPad, Apple has held the line
on cost by taking advantage of price erosion in other areas.

IHS' Teardown Analysis Service checked each of the iPad Air's components, pictured. The firm only looked at the price in dollars, but if the figures are converted to UK prices this works out at £170 production costs compared to a retail price of £399. This works out at a 135 per cent mark-up.

‘Furthermore, the iPad Air leverages the same components and
suppliers that are used in the iPhone 5s and 5c as much as possible.’

The profitability of the iPad Air rises dramatically as the
built-in storage capacity increases.

For example, the 32GB model costs Apple only £5.20 ($8.40) more
to produce - but has a retail price that’s £80 more in the UK and $100 higher in the U.S.

Apple was criticised for not dropping the prices of its
latest iPhones and iPads in a bid to appeal to emerging markets.

This cost breakdown shows that Apple is sticking to its
traditional pricing strategy. This may also be, in part, due to the fact the firm’s
earnings recently fell 9 per cent.

It was the third consecutive quarter its earnings dropped
compared with the previous year.

US figures

Cost to make (plus $6 overall manufacturing cost): $280 

Sales price: $499

In this instance $274 = 100 per cent. To find out the relative percentage for the sales price, $280 is divided by 100 (%) to make 2.8.

This is essentially equivalent to one per cent. If the sales price of $499 is divided by 2.8, it works out at 178 per cent, meaning the mark-up is 78 per cent. 

UK figures

IHS’ Teardown Analysis Service only looked at the price in
dollars, so the figures were directly converted to UK prices for components - the sales price is the price available in the Apple store.

Cost to make (plus £4 overall manufacturing cost): £174 

Sales price: £399

In this instance £174 = 100 per cent, so £174 is divided by 100 (%) to make 1.74.

If the sales price of £399 is divided by 1.74, it works out at 229 per cent, meaning the mark-up is 129 per cent.
