Ukip MEPs were today accused of showing 'complete disregard' for road safety  after voting against new rules making it easier to track and punish reckless foreign motorists caught speeding  in the UK.

At the moment, foreign drivers caught by a speed camera  cannot be fined because the police do not have the power to trace people abroad.

But the European Parliament has backed new measures giving  forces the power to send fines and pursue foreign motorists back to their home countries.

But Ukip's MEPs voted against the measure, because it also allows foreign police forces to track British motorists caught speeding abroad.

Motorists caught by speed cameras abroad face being tracked down and forced to pay a fine, under new EU rules

A Labour source said Ukip was showing 'complete disregard' for road safety in the UK.

Shadow Transport Secretary Michael Dugher added: 'These new laws will make it easier to catch foreign drivers who commit offences within the UK.

'They will ensure that drivers in foreign-registered vehicles will no longer be able to just flout laws on serious driving offences without facing the consequences. It is right that the UK authorities will be able to get the tools they need to identify offenders.

'Why does UKIP want to let foreigners driving in Britain off the hook?'

Motorists can already be traced abroad if they are driving hire cars or given on-the-spot fines.

But the new rules will allow motorists to be fined for speeding, ignoring a red light, drink and drug driving and driving while using a mobile phone.

If a driver commits an offence in another country, the police will be able to use their car's registration number to track them down. 

They will be given the power to send out a letter in the driver's own language, demanding payment and threatening court action if they do not pay the fine.

Labour's shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher has slammed Nigel Farage over Ukip's failure to back new rules making it easier to catch foreign motorists flouting the law in the UK

It means British police will be able to pursue foreign motorists driving in Britain for any traffic and speeding fines they have accumulated in the UK.

The Bill will apply to member states from May – but the UK will have two years to enforce the new law.

The move, which is backed by ministers, has been welcomed by road safety campaigners.

Ed Morrow, from the organisation Brake, said: 'For a driver who puts lives at risk to escape prosecution because their vehicle is registered in another country is both insulting and incomprehensible for victims. Illegal driving crosses borders, so enforcement must cross borders too.'

The Department for Transport added: 'It's not right that foreign drivers have gone unpunished for speeding offences in the UK, and we are pleased this is set to change.

'But it mustn't be easier for British drivers to be prosecuted abroad than for foreign drivers to be prosecuted in the UK. We have made this clear from the outset of the negotiations.'

But, Ukip transport spokeswoman Jill Seymour said: 'Typically the Tory government say they will oppose it in London while Tory MEPs vote for it in Brussels.

'Ukip are completely united in their will that only British authorities have access to the data about British drivers. The EU harmonisation of legislation means the centralisation of power in Brussels. The LibLabCon may consent to this but UKIP never will.

'This report relates to speeding offences; the idea is to be able to transfer licence points across Member States. Not all Member States are the same; this could lead to unfair cases of people being banned from driving.

'LibLabCon meps are happy for you to lose your license....Just ask them about it in May. '
