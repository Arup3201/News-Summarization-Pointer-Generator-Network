Suspect: Justin DeRyke, 22, was arrested after the body of his niece, Willow Long, was found near a river bed in Watson, Illinois

An Illinois man charged with murder in the death of his 7-year-old niece has told police that the girl impaled herself on a brush stick and he slit her throat to end her suffering.

Justin DeRyke, 22, has been charged with three counts of first-degree murder in the slaying of Willow Long in Watson Saturday night.

When questioned by police, Mr DeRyke detailed how he had spent most of the evening Saturday  playing video games while babysitting Willow and her 3-year-old brother.

The children’s mother was at a local bar, while their grandparents were at work at the time. 

At around 10.30pm, the 22-year-old 
caretaker went into his bedroom to watch a pornographic video, the station Fox4KC reported.

When he came out 
of the bathroom half an hour later, DeRyke said Willow approached him and grabbed his hand to get him to watch a movie, inadvertently scratching him.

The uncle grew mad and yelled at his niece, who ran out of the house, and according to DeRyke, tripped and fell on a pile of sharp brush sticks, one of which stabbed her in the neck.

DeRyke told investigators that he saw his niece twitching and did not want her to suffer, so he grabbed a knife from his room, slit the child's throat and then stabbed her in the heart about five times to 'put her out of her misery.'

According to court documents, DeRyke packaged Willow's body in several plastic bags secured with duct tape, and then disposed of her in a rural area south of Watson. The remains were discovered by volunteers Monday.

However, an autopsy showed that besides injuries to her throat, collarbone and chest, Willow also suffered defensive wounds to her hands, suggesting that she had fought for her life.

Innocent: According to DeRyke, he became angry with Willow and yelled at her after she had scratched him while tugging on his hand

The 22-year-old murder suspect remains jailed on $5million bail. He is due back in court September 19.

On Tuesday, the Illinois Department of Children and Family Service took Willow's 3-year-old brother into protective custody.

Funeral services for Willow will be held at 11am next Monday at First Baptist Church in Effingham, followed by private burial.

The little girl attended Southside Grade School in Effingham, where she had just begun her second grade year.

Willow's grandfather, Dale DeRyke, who is also the father of the alleged killer, said his son panicked after what he claimed was an accident.

Dale DeRyke told Fox2Now Justin was babysitting the little girl on Saturday night. 

He said the two were playing when Willow ran outside, where a pile of sticks was scattered over the floor.

'A stick went through her and through her head,' he said.

'She was laying there twitching and dying.'

Mr DeRyke then claimed his son got scared and hid the body. Now he says his son has 'nothing but remorse,' for what he has done.

‘He's
thinking, “Oh my God, I killed her or she's died. They are going to 
blame me,"’ Dale DeRyke, a truck driver, told St. Louis' KSDK-TV. ‘He's 
not thinking correctly ... He tries to hide her. He's scared.’

Four
of the hundreds of searchers who scoured farm fields, sheds and other 
rural structures in the area over a 30-hour span discovered Willow's 
body Monday night.

They 
found it a few miles from her family's home, wrapped in several garbage 
bags and sealed with duct tape. DeRyke was arrested the next morning.

Effingham
County State's Attorney Bryan Kibler said in court Wednesday that 
Justin DeRyke drew suspicion during questioning by Illinois State 
Police.

The prosecutor also
pointed out that DeRyke went to his restaurant job Sunday in Effingham 
instead of helping search for his niece.

A neighbor told the station KMOV that he saw DeRyke drinking beer instead of joining the search party looking for his niece.

Willow's
mother had initially told police that she last saw her daughter alive 
watching television Sunday morning and that she fell asleep and woke up 
to discover the girl was gone.

While
an estimated time of Willow's death based on the condition of her body 
hasn't been released, her mother's version appears to contradict 
DeRyke's account that the girl already was dead when the mother claimed 
to have seen her.

Tearful friends and neighbors marched down the quiet Watson, Illinois street adjacent to the little girl's house, carrying stuffed animals and balloons in memory of her on Tuesday afternoon.

They were placed outside the DeRyke home, which was still a crime scene two hours earlier.

Willow and her 3-year-old brother were left in the care of their uncle while their mother was in a bar and their grandparents were busy at work

A 10-year-old girl and friend of Willow, Ashlee Erikson, said: 'She was a nice kind bright little girl and she was my best friend. 

'She was gone too soon.'

Her mother, Dawn Erikson was also overcome with emotion.

She said: 'We moved away from the big city to get away from this. 

'And to have it happen here is ridiculous. And to find out it was her own family? 

'These are gifts from God.'
