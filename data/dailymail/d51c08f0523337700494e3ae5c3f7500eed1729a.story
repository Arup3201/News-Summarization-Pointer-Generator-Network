Neymar was incredible for Brazil in a 4-0 demolition of Panama.

The Barcelona superstar was at his brilliant best, scoring a sublime free-kick to open the scoring, before showing off a plethora of flicks and tricks that looked as if he was playing against children.

But how did Luiz Felipe Scolari's Premier League based players get on?

Brilliant: Neymar was the star of the show as Brazil beat Panama 4-0 in a World Cup warm-up

Good start: Luiz Felipe Scolari's team have just one game before they start their campaign on home soil

Still a contracted to Queens Park Rangers - though not for long it would seem - Brazil's No 1 was a commanding presence throughout.

Panama rarely troubled Cesar but he did pull off one spectacular save. After slipping on a terrible pitch at the Serra Dourada, Cesar recovered and made an acrobatic leap to tip a looping header over the bar.

He always looked assured and was given the captain's armband after David Luiz went off.

Safe hands: QPR's Julio Cesar was in good form all night, pulling off one very good save after slipping

Quiet: Oscar was overshadowed by Neymar and Brazil were better when Willian was introduced

Looked a little bit lost positionally and was completely overshadowed by the brilliant Neymar.

He wants to play behind the striker but he often ended up out on the left, with Scolari preferring to use the Barca man in the hole.

His position for the World Cup opener looks under threat as he doesn't have the pace to operate out wide. Was replaced by Willian early in the second half.

Struggled, as did his team-mates, in the opening 15 minutes as Panama started the better of the two.

Overrun in the midfield at times in what can sometimes look like a 4-2-4 for the hosts, but eventually found his footing as well as providing the usual energy.

Withdrawn at half-time and Brazil were much more confident on the ball with his replacement, Hernanes, but by then Panama had given up.

Slow starter: Ramires started slowly but eventually showed his usual vim and vigour in the midfield

Came on and provided some much needed width, allowing Neymar more space in the middle. Was in the right place at the right time to score the fourth goal, and would have had two assists had two inch-perfect crosses been aimed at somebody other than Jo.

Could be in line to start for Scolari, Brazil looked much more balanced with Willian if the manager intends to play Neymar as a second striker.

Late claim? Willian's performance, including a goal, will give him a chance to start the opening game

Unused substitute.

Unused substitute.

Chelsea fans will be extremely familiar with the way in which the Brazil captain for the night picked up his yellow card. Rushing out from the centre of defence to challenge his man on the half-way line, the rash Luiz lashed out after being easily turned.

Actually settled down after that but Panama offered little threat. Played a wondreful pass to Neymar in the build-up to Hulk's goal.

Reckless; David Luiz was booked for the kind of tackle Chelsea fans will be glad to see the back of
