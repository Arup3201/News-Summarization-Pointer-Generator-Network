An excessive-force lawsuit has revealed audio  of a female cop suggesting to a group of fellow officers that they turn off the dashcam before continuing with the brutal take-down of a suspect.

Officer Kelli Swinton can be heard saying: 'Hold up. Hold up, y'all. Hold up. Hold up, everybody, hold up. We're red right now, so if you guys are worried about cameras, just wait.'

At the time, more than half a dozen officers from the St Louis Metropolitan Police Department were surrounding 18-year-old Cortez Bufford, who was on the ground following a traffic stop last April. 

Four of the officers involved were now facing a lawsuit, filed last month, after it was claimed they used excessive force by kicking and twice Tasering the teen, his lawyer told Daily Mail Online on Monday.

Soon after more than half a dozen officers surround the teenage suspect in St Louis, Missouri, another cop warned them that the dash-cam was still running - and then the screen goes dark

Officer Kelli Swinton can be heard saying: 'Hold up. Hold up, y'all. Hold up. Hold up, everybody, hold up. We're red right now, so if you guys are worried about cameras, just wait'

Attorney Joel Schwartz said today that Mr Bufford was left with abrasions on his face and back and substantial medical bills after being treated in hospital. 

He is seeking an undisclosed amount in damages in a lawsuit expected to be settled in the fall. 

The cop who warned fellow officers about the camera may face disciplinary action, according to the St Louis-Post Dispatch.

According to Mr Bufford's lawyers, the footage was reportedly held back for several months after the St Louis area erupted into protests centered around the suburb of Ferguson, following the cop shooting death of unarmed black teen Michael Brown.

The incident began on April 10 last year, when the Ford Taurus being driven by Mr Bufford made an 'illegal U-turn' and 'abruptly parked' , according to a police report. 

However dashcam footage contradicts this by showing the suspect parking up correctly.

The report, seen by the STL Post-Dispatch, also said that cops saw marijuana and baggies in the car. 

Daily Mail Online was awaiting a copy of the police report from the St Louis Metropolitan Police Department on Monday  

As seen in the dashcam video, around 10.15pm, he refuses to get out of the car, even as his passenger does what the cops ask. 

The police report stated that Bufford then reached for a gun. One officer can be seen running at the suspect and appeared to swing a kick at his head.

On the video, the teenager can be heard screaming and the noise of a Taser can be heard. Mr Bufford can be heard yelling on the tape: 'I can't move.'

Police later found a loaded semi-automatic pistol in the car. 

As more cops run in, Officer Swinton suggested turning off the dashcam and the screen goes blank. 

Bufford was charged with a felony for unlawful use of a weapon and a a misdemeanor of resisting arrest. The charges were dropped in August because the camera was turned off. 

Officer Swinton was reportedly appealing disciplinary action.
