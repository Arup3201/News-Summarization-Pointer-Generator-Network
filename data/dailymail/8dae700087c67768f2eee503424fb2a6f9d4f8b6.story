A Memphis police officer has been suspended for allegedly having sex in his squad car while on duty. 

Fellow officers said they heard Dion Anthony having sex with an unnamed woman between 8.45 and 9pm last Monday, when it was broadcast over his radio scanner. 

Anthony works the 2pm to 10pm shift out of the Mount Moriah precinct, meaning that he was on duty at the time.

Like all radio communications between officers the broadcast was recorded and is now part of an open investigation by the department.

Sergeant Karen Rudolph told Fox 13 that every Police Officer is given two modes of radio communication: a shoulder microphone that stays with them and a console mic that stays in their squad car.

It is not yet clear which radio captured the recording.

‘Rather than picking up the phone, we use what's given to us with our consoles and microphones. A lot of times it's our life lines,’ Rudolph said.

‘Anytime you communicate via a handheld or console microphone you want to remain professional.'

‘Our job is to make sure all officers follow procedures. In this instance it's possible he didn't follow proper procedure.’

Sources told the news channel that the broadcast was on an open channel that could be heard by not only the 30 to 35 officers working that precinct but by anybody with a police scanner.

Anthony, who has worked for the force since 2007, was relieved of duty last Tuesday while the department investigates.
