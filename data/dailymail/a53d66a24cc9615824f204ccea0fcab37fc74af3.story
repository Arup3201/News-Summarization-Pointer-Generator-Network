Shocking footage has emerged of an elephant being violently beaten in India following an undercover investigation.

The malnourished 14-year-old elephant called Sunder is chained by two legs, writhing in pain and struggling to stand as its handlers, known as a mahouts, strike it repeatedly with the pole. 

Sunder visibly recoils in fear from the weapon-wielding young men who continue to threaten the animal with violence after it has finally managed to stand.

An undercover investigation has uncovered footage of an elephant being violently beaten in India

Sunder was chained and abused for six years at the Jyotiba Temple in Kolhapur. 

The animal was dragged from a forest in the south-west of the country and presented as a 'gift'.

Following orders by the Maharashtra Forest Department and Project Elephant the temple was told to send Sunder to a sanctuary.

But he is being kept in an old dark poultry shed in Warananagar instead.

The investigation was carried out by campaign group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).

It says the Nagpur-based principal chief conservator of forests and current head of forest force, SWH Naqvi, has failed to implement the state and central government orders.

Peta say Indian politicians are claiming Sunder is fine and healthy.

The Kolhapur division of the Forest Department also says 'every month a veterinary doctor visits the place to check the elephant,' according to PETA.

Cruel: The young men are seen hitting the elephant so hard it falls to the ground unable to stand up

Plea: The malnourished 14-year-old elephant called Sunder is chained by its two legs while it is violently beaten

Fear: Sunder visibly recoils in fear from the weapon-wielding young men who continue to threaten the animal

Evidence: A distressed Sunder collapses to the ground after taking a beating from its handlers

These claims are in spite of scarring on Sunder's legs from abuse, he has a low weight and he is being forced to stand on concrete all day with no opportunity for exercise.

This new video shows the animal is also being beaten. 

Dr Mel Richardson, elephant expert who examined the footage, said: 'He is fearful of the mahout.' 'From what I can see his legs and feet are in bad shape.

Suffering: Sunder tethered in the temple shed, where he was taken after being dragged from a forest in the South-West of the country

'He is in a dangerous situation and needs relief – no chains, natural substrate, and space to exercise.'

'Vinay Kore and the Kolhapur division of the Forest Department seem to be trying to fool the public, but an elephant needs space to roam and the companionship of other elephants – not more years of being chained on concrete, cowering in fear of a violent mahout', says PETA UK Associate Director Mimi Bekhechi. 

'It's long past time to follow through on their promises: Sunder needs to be sent to a sanctuary today.'

Former Beatle Paul McCartney and Hollywood actress Pamela Anderson have previously written to authorities calling for Sunder's release.

Brutal: Sunder's feet are chained with spiked manacles so he cannot take a single step in any direction

McCartney wrote: ‘I have seen photographs of young Sunder, the elephant kept alone in a shed at Jyotiba Temple and put in chains with spikes.

‘I appeal to you to do what is right here and get Sunder post-haste to rehabilitation in the forest.

‘Years of his life have been ruined by keeping him and abusing him in this way and enough is enough.

‘I most respectfully call on you to use your authority to get Sunder out, placed in your protective custody and eventually integrated into a herd in the forest.’

PETA India has filed a petition with the High Court of Bombay asking the Maharashtra Forest Department (MFD) to implement its previous order – as well as the recommendation from Project Elephant under the Ministry of Environment and Forests – and retire Sunder to a sanctuary.

Following pressure from PETA India, more than 26,000 people who have signed the online petition. 

The petition filed at the High Court of Bombay is listed for its first hearing on December 10 this year. To support the campaign visit http://petauk.org/sunder
