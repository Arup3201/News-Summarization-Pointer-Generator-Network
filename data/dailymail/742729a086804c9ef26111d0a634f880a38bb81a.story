Tesco has agreed to ban displays of chocolate and other sweets next to checkouts in 1,800 of its smaller Express and Metro stores

Sweets and chocolate are to be banned from all Tesco store checkouts in a bid to combat pester power and rising obesity among children.

The high sugar and fat confectionary will be phased out from so-called ‘guilt aisles’ in response to demands from parents and health campaigners.

The chain removed confectionary from the checkouts at its large stores 20 years ago, however it is now extending it to some 1,800 smaller Express and Metro outlets.

The decision will heap pressure on other retailers to follow suit amid claims from some health campaigners that sugar is the ‘new tobacco’ because of the damage over-consumption can cause in terms of weight and health.

Lidl announced it was removing junk food from checkouts in January, however the move by Tesco is particularly significant because it is the UK’s biggest retailer.

Tesco said its own research found two thirds of shoppers – 65per cent - said removing confectionery from checkouts would help them make healthier choices.

Similarly, some 67per cent of parents said that having no confectionery near the checkout would help them make healthier choices for their children.

Tesco chief executive, Philip Clarke, said: ‘We all know how easy it is to be tempted by sugary snacks at the checkout, and we want to help our customers lead healthier lives.

‘We’ve already removed billions of calories from our soft drinks, sandwiches and ready meal ranges by changing the recipes to reduce their sugar, salt and fat content. And we will continue to look for opportunities to take out more.’

The decision by Tesco to go it alone follows the breakdown of talks between retailers and the Government earlier this year which would have introduced a voluntary blanket ban on the sale of junk food at all checkouts.

Easy access to high calorie sweets and chocolates at checkouts has concerned health expects and politicians for many years.

A recent study by the University of Sheffield found nine in ten items at the checkouts of supermarket convenience stores would be considered ‘very unhealthy’, according to Food Standards Agency guidelines.

The vast majority of these were chocolate treats and stacked on shelves at one metre and below, which is directly in the eye-line of children aged 3-5.

Dr Jason Horsley, who was involved in the research, said: ‘The checkout is an area which all shoppers must pass through, so displays of highly desirable calorie-dense foodstuffs are an unavoidable exposure.

‘Children are a significant market for retailers of processed foodstuffs and budgets dedicated to advertising to children have grown exponentially in the last three decades.

‘Youngsters are often naïve to sophisticated marketing techniques and they influence parents’ purchases through pester power.

‘We know from other research that children have pester power to change their parents purchasing. They will see something, want it and have a tantrum if they don’t get. It depends how brave the parent is as to whether they buy it or not.’

The Prime Minister has previously lambasted stores for using this tactic, famously attacking WH Smith for putting boxes of chocolate oranges at checkouts.

As far back as 2006, the then Opposition complained in a speech about ‘irresponsible’ marketing techniques by shops.

He said: ‘Try and buy a newspaper at the train station and, as you queue to pay, you’re surrounded, you’re inundated by cut-price offers for giant chocolate bars.

‘As Britain faces an obesity crisis, why does WH Smith promote half-price chocolate oranges at its checkouts instead of real oranges?’

The removal of the sweets is a major victory for the ‘Junk Free Checkouts’ campaign, which was launched last year on the back of research which found eight in ten parents were unhappy that stores continue to fuel obesity and pester power by putting sweets at the tills.

The initiative was backed by both the food and health charity Sustain and the British Dietetic Association, who both welcomed the decision by Tesco and called on others to follow suit.

Ben Reynolds of Sustain said: ‘Parents will be delighted to hear that they will no longer be pestered for fatty, salty and sugary snacks whilst queuing at the checkout in their local Tesco.

‘Both Tesco and Lidl have chucked junk off the checkouts following surveys with their customer surveys showing that this move would be popular and not affect their profits. 

'We hope that other supermarkets will now realise that taking action to improve children’s health is not something to fear.’

Katie O’Donovan from Mumsnet said: ‘Popping into a shop with a small child in tow can sometimes feel like navigating an assault course.

'If you’ve made it to the checkout in one piece it can be really frustrating to then be faced with an unhealthy array of sweets designed to tempt your child.

'It’s really positive to see a supermarket responding to the views of their customers and trying to make life that little bit easier.’
