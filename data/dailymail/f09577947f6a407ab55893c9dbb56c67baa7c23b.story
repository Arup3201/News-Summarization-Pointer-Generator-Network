Actress Sarah Goldberg passed away aged 40 from a suspected heart condition last month 

An actress who starred in Jurassic Park III and on the TV show 7th Heaven has died in her sleep, her family confirmed.

Sarah Goldberg passed away aged 40 at her family's cabin in Wisconsin from a suspected heart condition on September 27. 

Miss Goldberg, from Chicago, had movie roles in My Best Friend's Wedding and Training Day and appeared in TV shows Judging Amy, Without A Trace, 90210 and House.

An autopsy failed to come to a conclusion on a cause of death, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. 

Her mother told the paper: 'She went to sleep and didn't wake up.' 

Ms Goldberg was born in 1974 in Springfield, Illinois and attended the Latin School of Chicago.

She went to to study for a bachelors degree in biology at Amherst College in 1996 before embarking on her acting career. 

She took the leap and went to Hollywood by herself, landing TV role after TV role under the stage name of Sarah Danielle Madison.

In her obituary, Miss Goldberg was described as someone who loved the outdoors and enjoyed camping, waterskiing, fishing and canoeing.

She was also devoted to animal rescue. The actress had two dogs, Daisy and Bucket, whom she rescued and who lived with her in Los Angeles. 

Her family requested that instead of flowers, donations be sent to the Sarah Goldberg Memorial Fund at PAWS, 1997 N Clybourn Ave, Chicago, IL 60614. 

She is survived by her parents, Judy and Bill Goldberg, her brother Bradley (Michelle), her niece and her nephew along with many extended family members and close friends. 

Her funeral arrangements were kept private.
