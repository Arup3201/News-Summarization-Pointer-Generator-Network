A man has been charged with the murder a Food Network star and her husband.

Cristie Codd and her husband Joseph of Leicester, North Carolina, were reported missing on Sunday, and now police have charged Robert Jason Owens with two counts of first degree murder, one count of murder of an unborn child, breaking and entering, and larceny after breaking and entering.

Cristie, who was a competitor on the eighth season of the show Food Network Star, was five months pregnant. 

Cristie Codd and her husband Joseph (above) were reported missing on Sunday, and on Monday it was revealed the couple had been murdered

On Tuesday, Robert Jason Owens (above) was charged with killing the couple and stealing jewelry, a computer and a Glock from their home

The couple had been using Owens, who owns a construction company, to do some work at their home (above)

Fox Carolina reports that authorities believe Christie, 38, and Joseph, 45, were killed on Thursday, and that Owens returned to the couple's home on Sunday and ran off with their 'laptop computer, jewelry and a Glock handgun'

Police have yet to comment on how the couple were killed as their bodies have not yet been discovered.

Their cars and two dogs were found at their home.

Owens, who is being held without bail, appeared in court on Tuesday where he requested an attorney and his next hearing was scheduled for April.

He had also been a suspect in the disappearance of 18-year-old Zebb Quinn in January 2000, a case that remains unsolved.

The couple had been using Owens, who owns a construction company, to do some work at their home. 

They were both set to leave for work on Sunday, with Cristie catering on a movie set  and Joseph heading off to Los Angeles to work as a key grip on a production.

It was a very big movie set for Cristie too, as she had just announced her company, Tree Hugger Catering, would be providing food on the set of The Big Short, starring Brad Pitt, Ryan Gosling, Christian Bale and Steve Carell.

James Fisher, a member of a local band that played the Codds' wedding last September, said the two were a 'beautiful couple' 

He told the Citizen-Times of Joesph; 'I know he believed in giving people second chances, and he'd hired people out there who'd been in prison.'

As for playing at their wedding, he said; 'He made sure we were taken care of. They brought us over a cooler of beer. Just a great couple.'

It is still unclear what Owens' motive was behind the alleged murder. 

Buncombe County District Attorney Todd Williams has said he has not yet decided if he will ask for the death penalty in this case.
