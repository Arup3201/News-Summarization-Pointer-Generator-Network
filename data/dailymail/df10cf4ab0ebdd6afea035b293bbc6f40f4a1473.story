Troubled bank HSBC announced a 17 per cent fall in annual profits today but still managed to make more than £12.1billion last year.

Its annual results for 2014 were almost £3billion worse than in 2013 but it still made around £33million a day and paid its staff £2.3billion in bonuses.

Britain's biggest bank is embroiled in an ongoing row over allegations that its Swiss private banking arm helped thousands of wealthy clients avoid tax.

Chief executive Stuart Gulliver said today the bank 'disappointed' last year and was forced to set aside cash to deal with the Swiss scandal as well as other fines and disputes. 

This morning shares plummeted by 30p to £5.73 when the London Stock Exchange opened this morning.

Allegations: Leaked files reportedly show that Stuart Gulliver (pictured), chief executive since 2011, held £5million in the bank's Geneva-based subsidiary that was at the centre of a huge tax avoidance scandal

Ex-director of public prosecutions Lord Ken Macdonald said HSBC could face criminal charges in the UK after revelations its Swiss private bank helped clients dodge tax.  The Financial Conduct Authority is currently looking into the scandal. 

Lord Macdonald said there is evidence 'that HSBC Swiss and/or its employees have engaged over many years in systematic and profitable collusion in serious criminal activity.'

Stuart Gulliver's total pay package for 2014 was £7.6million, including a bonus of just under £1.3 million. This is down from last year's bonus of £1.8million. is.

It is not tied directly to performance and as a result does not count as a bonus under new European rules preventing bankers from being paid bonuses worth more than two times their salary.

Mr Gulliver's previous pay scheme offered an annual bonus worth up to three times his salary.

Overall across the bank in 2014 staff received £2.38billion in bonuses, down from £2.5billion.

It came amid claims that Mr Gulliver himself sheltered millions of pounds in a Swiss bank account.

Leaked files reportedly show that Stuart Gulliver held £5million in the bank's Geneva-based subsidiary that was at the centre of a huge tax avoidance scandal. 

The revelation comes after leaked documents from HSBC Private Bank in Switzerland (pictured) between 2005 and 2007 showed it had helped the rich and famous avoid millions in tax

The 55-year-old's bonuses were paid through an anonymous company registered in Panama to a Swiss account until 2003, according to the Guardian.

Stuart Gulliver was last night accused of using the same HSBC Private Bank in Switzerland that helped the rich and famous avoid millions in tax. 

Last Sunday Mr Gulliver personally signed a 'sincere apology' published in several newspapers.

The chief executive, who grew up in Plymouth, has spent three decades with HSBC. He was in charge of global banking and markets when the Swiss scandal was at its peak from 2005 to 2007.

According to The Guardian, Mr Gulliver was listed as the beneficial owner of an account in the name of Worcester Equities Inc. It was through this that his HSBC bonuses were paid until 2003.

The files also show he held a second account in the name of Worcester Foundation, which was closed before 2007. His representatives said he used HSBC Suisse to hold his bonus payments before 2003, when he moved from Hong Kong to London.

They said tax had been paid on this income, adding that the Swiss accounts had been voluntarily declared to UK tax authorities for a number of years. A representative said: 'Our client has become a permanent Hong Kong resident with right of abode.' 

The Oxford graduate is also domiciled in Hong Kong for legal and tax purposes – despite being born in Derby and based in the UK at HSBC's headquarters.

Mr Gulliver, who became chief executive in 2011, has pledged to reform HSBC following the scandal. 

He admitted that 2014 had been a challenging year, with profits down due to a number of one-off factors including the settlement of regulatory fines.

He added: 'Profits disappointed, although a tough fourth quarter masked some of the progress made over the preceding three quarters.

'Many of the challenging aspects of the fourth-quarter results were common to the industry as a whole.'

In relation to the Swiss tax scandal, HSBC chairman Douglas Flint said the bank needed to reinforce controls and demonstrate their effectiveness.

He added: 'We deeply regret and apologise for the conduct and compliance failures highlighted, which were in contravention of our own policies as well as expectations of us.'

The bank was also the subject of a £216 million fine from the Financial Conduct Authority relating to HSBC's failure to prevent the rigging of foreign exchange operations. 

Cathy Jamieson, Labour's shadow Treasury minister, said: 'People will be astounded that bonuses of this size are still being paid out after the revelations of the last few days.

'This underlines Labour's determination to repeat the tax on bank bonuses in order to fund a jobs programme for young people. We also need wider reform of the banking industry, including extending clawback of bank bonuses to at least ten years in cases where there has been inappropriate behaviour.

'And George Osborne still has serious questions to answer over the HSBC scandal including what the government did when it first received these files in May 2010 and over the appointment of Lord Green as a Conservative Minister.'
