The RSPCA is to close the animal hospital made famous in the BBC TV show of the same name presented by disgraced broadcaster Rolf Harris.

The closure of Putney Animal Hospital and three other London clinics comes as it struggles with dwindling donations and a negative profile.

But critics accused the RSPCA of deserting its role of treating sick animals in favour of ‘politicised’ prosecutions.

Tim Bonner of the Countryside Alliance said: ‘This is in an inevitable consequence of pursuing a politicised agenda that has alienated so many of its supporters.

'It has a choice where to cut. Closures suggest it is again prioritising politics and prosecution over caring for animals on the front line.’ 

In 2012, the charity was criticised by a judge for its £326,000 prosecution against the Heythrop Hunt, based in David Cameron’s constituency.

Figures published last May show the RSPCA’s voluntary income in 2013 dropped from £112.4 million to £105.4 million.

The Putney closure is a ‘huge blow’ according to staff. Its clients are pensioners and those on low incomes who cannot afford private pet care.

Last night a spokesman said: ‘The RSPCA has to target those animals most in need of our help and streamline our frontline services.’
