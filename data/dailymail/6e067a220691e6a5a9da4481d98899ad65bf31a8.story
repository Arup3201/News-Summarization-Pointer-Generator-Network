Bayern 
Munich may have been demolished by eventual winners Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-finals but they are superior to the Spanish giants in one respect as they are the world's No 1 football brand.

Real were once the most valuable
football brand on the planet but suffered during Spain's recent economic crisis and at one point fell to third - although the 10-time European champions are back up to second.

Bayern, who Real deposed as kings of Europe, are Germany's biggest club and won the Bundesliga with a record points total. They now have a value of £531m.

Top ten: Manchester Unite have fallen to third in the Brand Finance table while Bayern Munich are on top

Having
 earned their 10th European triumph, Real now lead all Premier League 
teams in the brand table for the first time since 2010. 

Manchester United's brand value has fallen following the club's dismal Premier League campaign under David Moyes last season.

Having
 lead the way as football’s most valuable brand for
several years, their 2014 value of £439m sees a drop by nearly 
£60m in a single year after finishing seventh following Sir Alex
 Ferguson’s retirement last year.

To
 make matters worse for United, the Brand Finance table shows 
local rivals Manchester City have gained on their rivals - climbing from
 eighth to fifth following their second Premier 
League title win.

Struggle: United finished seventh in the Premier League after David Moyes took over from Sir Alex Ferguson

Noisy: Neighbours Manchester City, who won the Premier League, climbed to fifth in the brand rankings

City also lifted the Capital One Cup and their brand value, which is is rapidly growing, now stands at over 
£300million.

After
 the club's owners launched a partnership with the New York Yankees and 
New York City MLS franchise last year, the blue half of Manchester have 
already set about expanding across the globe.

Atletico Madrid, who lost the Champions League final in extra-time, broke the long-standing Real-Barcelona duopoly in Spain this season by landing the La Liga title and have seen their brand value surge. Diego Simeone's men now sit 19th in the table.

French powerhouse Paris Saint-Germain edged into the top 10 of the Brand Finance 50 for the first time, having won their second consecutive Ligue 1 title.

Brand value is essentially the cost that a third party would have to pay
 to licence the use of a brand. Brand strength analysis benchmarks 
strength, risk, longevity and future potential of the brand relative to 
competitors. This takes into account financial metrics such as revenue 
mix and growth, football specific marketing metrics such as honours, 
squad value, club heritage, Kickdex data, UEFA coefficient ranking and 
average attendance amongst others.

Off the pitch: Trophyless Chelsea are worth £298million as a brand

Lifted: Arsenal won the FA Cup this season and are ahead of Chelsea in sixth place

Top of the pile: Bayern Munich, who ran away with the Bundesliga, are top of the rankings

Having agreed a £50m deal with 
Chelsea for Brazil defender David Luiz and already boasting world-class 
players such as Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the club from the French capital 
have seen their brand value almost quadruple in just a year.

The club's continuing relationship with shirt sponsor Emirates and a new deal with Chinese tech giant Huawei suggests they will continue to expand.

In terms of the Premier League, Tottenham remain 12th while Everton edged into top 20, climbing 13 places since last season. Aston Villa, West Ham and Newcastle all made it into the top 30.

Fulham's relegation to the Championship saw a 36 per cent drop in the club's brand value and they are now clinging on to their place in the top 50.

Trailing: Barcelona endured a tough season on the pitch, and are fifth in the table
