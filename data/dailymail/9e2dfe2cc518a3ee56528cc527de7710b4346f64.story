Controversial: The Casino Rooms nightclub distributed this flyer advertising its 'National Cleavage Weekender'

A nightclub has sparked fury by offering free entry to female revellers who expose their cleavage.

The Casino Rooms Nightclub in Rochester, Kent, came under fire after promoting its 'National Cleavage Weekender' complete with flyers showing seven busty revellers in low-cut tops.

The flyer states: 'It's not about the size, it's about the presentation....Free entry for exposed cleavage B4 11pm on any night....Only at Kent's biggest and breast party venue.'

Locals are appalled at the promotion, saying it is 'disgusting' and 'degrading to women'.

The club's Facebook site shows a 
string of scantily-clad revellers and has previously run pole-dancing 
nights with £250 prizes for clubbers who strip off on stage.

The club is owned by the Aaron P
Stone Group which has previously hit the headlines after its chief 
operations manager Steven Hutchins was forced to step down as JP at 
Medway Magistrates Court after he applied for a licence for a fully-nude
lapdancing club in nearby Maidstone.

The
'National Cleavage Weekender', which is due to take place between April
4-6 at the 1,500-capacity club, has been roundly criticised by locals, 
who say it is 'degrading' to women.

Local
Sharon Abbeywell 42, said: 'This is truly disgusting - the very thought
of getting free entry for exposing your breasts to save £3 is 
disgraceful.

'Girls around here are bad enough as it is, without encouraging them to save money by getting their boobs out.'

Another
local, James Hartwell, 27, said: 'I'm all for a bit of fun, but this is
just taking things too far - girls will end up going along wearing 
barely a stitch just to save a few quid.'

Vince
Maple, a Labour councillor on Meday Council, said the event was 
'totally unacceptable', adding: 'This is not something I would expect to
see in a nightclub in the 21st century.

'It sends all the worst possible messages.'

Club boss Aaron Stone, however, defended the promotion, saying it was 'cheeky' and a bit of 'lighthearted fun'.

He said this week: 'It is a celebration of the female form.

'It is not meant to degrade anyone or embarrass anyone. It is a little bit cheeky, I'm not going to apologise for that.

'But it is lighthearted and fun. We are not trying to offend anyone. We are in no way sexist.'
