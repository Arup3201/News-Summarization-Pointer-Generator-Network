Steve Bruce has shown he's not quite the lean fit athlete he once was but showed some impressive diving skills.

The former Manchester United defender is currently enjoying a trip away to Barbados with his wife and friend Alan Shearer during the international break and made the most of the sun.

With his days of being a tough-tackling central defender gone, the 54-year-old is sporting a much wider circumference nowadays.

The Hull boss showed his diving ability but let's hope that his players don't follow his lead

With Hull facing a battle for Premier League surival, Bruce knows that his side are in no position to slip and face two tough away games against Swansea and Southampton in the next couple of weeks.

Just three points separate them and the drop zone and despite their bright start to the season, Bruce's men have arguably the hardest run-in, so relying on other teams slipping up is will also be important.
