A golden age of Belgian football has been threatening to dawn and it did so brilliantly in the 90th minute of this dense struggle against the dark, growling Russian bear.

That blood-red sun is unlikely to reach its zenith here but this young team of so many talents are going where Roy’s Boys are not – onto the last 16.

In two years’ time at the Euros they should be championship contenders. Hopefully their glittering light will stay high in the sky over  Russia 2018.

VIDEO Team Profile: Belgium

Belgium 4-3-2-1: Courtois 7.5; Alderwiereld 6.5, Van Buyten 6, Kompany 6.5, Vermaelen 5 (Vertonghen 30mins, 5.5); Witsel 6, Fellaini 5, Mertens 8 (Mirallas 75mins, 6.5); De Bruyne 6.5, Hazard 6; Lukaku 3.5 (Origi 55mins, 7)

Coach: Marc Wilmots 7.5

Goal: Origi 88

Russia 4-1-1-3-1: Akinfeev 7.5; Kozlov 5.5 (Eshchenko 65mins, 6), Berezutskiy 6.5, Ignashevich 5.5, Kombarov 6; Glushakov 7; Fayzulin 6.5; Samedov 5 (Kerzhak 90mins), Kanunnikov 6, Shatov 5 (Dzagoev 83mins); Kokorin 6

Coach: Fabio Capello 5.5

They are very much a team for the future, more so than England. They will benefit hugely from qualifying for the knock-out stages at Brazil 2014,  mature faster and  grow stronger from the experience.

If Russia are to go through with them, Fabio Capello, none other,  will have to find a way for them to beat Algeria next Thursday. Good luck, lads.

Between them, without hitting the exciting heights of so many of these beautiful games in Brazil, Belgium and Russia contested an absorbing match which came to the thrilling climax of that late, late winner.

When Belgian manager Marc Wilmots decided he had seen enough of a disappointing Romelu Lukaku, he found his match-winner. Substitute Divock Origi blasted high into the net from Eden Hazard’s brilliant run and low cross.

There was plenty for the folks back home in Blighty to cheer.

Prayers answered: Eden Hazard laid on the winner for Origi which sends Belgium into the second round

As an antidote for the withdrawal symptoms being suffered by English football fans as Hodgon’s men make ready to break camp and retreat from Rio, the Belgians came to the Maracana with their team-full complement of 11 Premier League players.

Five  of them started against Russia –  one each from Manchester City, Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal and Everton.

Six more were on the bench – two each from Manchester United and Spurs, one each from  Everton and Liverpool.

And since that did not include a goalkeeper make it a round dozen by throwing in Thibaut Courtois, who Jose Mourinho says will be back at Chelsea next season after three years on loan to Atletico Madrid.

Presumably they were being roared on in the pubs and bars from the King’s Road to Moss Side, from White Hart Lane to Merseyside as they  joined Argentina, France, Holland, Chile and – as if we could forget - Costa Rica – among those who have made it to the last 16 before their third group game.

With only three of their 23-man squad based in their own domestic league, Belgium are the most cosmopolitan team at Brazil 2014. In addition to those taking the English club game by storm, they draw on players from leading clubs in Spain, Germany, Italy, France, Portugal and Russia.

They are the cuckoos of the world game, occupying the nests of others and plucking priceless experience for themselves.

By total contrast, every man in Russia’s squad plays his club football in his homeland.

The only odd bird here with them Is their manager. Our former and unlamented friend Signor Capello.

Whatever language he uses to address his new charges, be sure it is not Russian or English. Nor Flemish.

Joke all you like about this Low Country but there is nothing boring about Belgian football.

Russia were playing not only to stay in the tournament but to promise they will be able to compete as well as host the next World Cup.

Belgium recalled Thomas Vermaelen for this outing in Rio, apparently en route from Arsenal to Manchester United. He looked as comfortable taking over from Tottenham’s Jan Vertonghen at left back as he did at centre half  in his early days at the Emirates.

In curious circumstances, Vermaelen and Vertonghen swapped bench for pitch places again after only half an hour. Vermaelen appeared to strain a knee during the pre-match warm up and the condition must have worsened in those 30 minutes.

Mertens was creating most of the early trouble for Russia, repeatedly escaping down the right to ply the goalmouth with awkward crosses, graze the outside of a post with one shot, then float a clever chip just the angle.

Unabashed at picking up the first yellow card of the match, Glushakov launched the cross which should have given Russia the lead a minute before half time.Centre-forward Kokorin held in his hands the head with which he steered the ball wide when unmarked at close range with only Courtois to beat.

Lukaku is looking out of his depth at this level and as Russia began to exert control he was replaced by Origi just ten minutes into the second half.

Belgium appeared to be beginning to fade. With the temperature climbing to the mid-80s it would be easy to blame the lunch-time heat but Russia come from an even colder clime and they were getting stronger by the minute.

Eshchenko, a substitute for Kozlov, drew a deep-throated roar from the Russian contingent with a fierce cross shot.

But the effort drained them and Belgium found a second wind.

Another substitute, Mirallas, hit a post from a free kick and Hazard fired wide from close in before setting up Origi and starting the Belgian beer-fest.
