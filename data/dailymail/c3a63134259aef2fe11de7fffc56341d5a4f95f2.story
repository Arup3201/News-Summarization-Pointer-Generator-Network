It's been 30 years since Annie Potts played Janine Melnitz in Ghostbusters, but the 61-year-old actress has a good idea of where her sassy character might be today.

According to Ms Potts, Janine - a secretary for the Ghostbusters - would have given up on fighting ghosts, and would probably now be running a pest control company instead.

'You know, snakes, squirrels, racoons... trying to get little bats out of the attic,' the mother-of-three, now a drama professor, tells Vanity Fair as part of its Improv Imagination series.

Ms Potts, who sports almost the same cropped red hairstyle today as she did in the 1984 blockbuster, lets her imagination run wild as she reels off modern-day predictions for her fictional character.

Janine is described as living in the Jersey Shore, owning 17 cats, frequenting cruise ships and singing Cyndi Lauper covers.

Her hobbies, Ms Potts suggests, might include taking a metal detector to the beach in search of lost Rolex's and rings, and her vacations would involve 'touring the national monuments.'

All grown up: Since her Ghostbusters years, the Nashville-born actress (pictured) has enjoyed minor roles in Law & Order, Ugly Betty and Two and a Half Men. She is now married to producer James Hayman

When asked whether she thinks Janine stayed with her love interest - nerdy bespectacled scientist Egon Spengle - she emphatically responds: 'Oh I always hoped.'

She suggests Egon would today be teaching at Princeton University and that if the couple had had kids, it probably wouldn't have been smooth sailing.

By way of example, she refers to a scene in the Ghostbusters sequel movie; in which Janine and Egon are looking after a baby who manages to get onto the roof without them noticing.

'She wasn't a very good babysitter,' Ms Potts remarks. 'I'm guessing she didn't turn out to be a very good mother.'

She then goes on to predict that Janine's children would still be living at home aged '30-plus,' wasting their lives playing video games.

Since her Ghostbusters years, the Nashville, Tennessee-born actress has enjoyed minor roles in Law & Order, Ugly Betty and Two and a Half Men, among others.

She was also the voice of Toy Story's Little Bo Peep, and has appeared in musicals and on Broadway. These days, she is a visiting professor at Stephens College, Missouri.

Ms Potts been divorced three times, but has been married to her fourth husband, TV producer James Hayman, since 1900.

She is mom to three sons; Clay, 30, James, 22, and Harry, 18.Â
