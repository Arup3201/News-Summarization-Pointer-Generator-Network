Here's where Christmas is sorted on a giant scale - a massive postal centre dealing with half a million parcels a day.

The giant temporary facility has been set up to handle the avalanche of online shopping over the festive period.

More than 300 seasonal staff have been taken on to run the sorting centre in Swindon, Wiltshire - one of eight set up by the Royal Mail around Britain.

It will operate for five weeks and will be at its busiest tomorrow when it will process around 500,000 items.

In total more than four million parcels will be sorted there and sent around the world, hopefully all in time for Christmas.

The Royal Mail said the centre was set up in response to the boom in websites like Amazon and eBay.

Mark Higson, managing director of operations and modernisation, said: 'Christmas is the busiest time of year for Royal Mail and our customers.

'Royal Mail has invested in eight dedicated parcel sort centres to increase our scale and improve our flexibility during this important time of year for our customers.

'As we do every year, we encourage people to post early and order presents early to help us spread the workload of handling the festive mailbag in the run up to Christmas.'

The other depots are in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Bolton, Tamworth, Peterborough, Swansea and Greenford, London.

Around 100 postal workers in south Bristol staged a 24-hour walk-out today on their busiest week of the year

The Communication Workers Union said the action was taken because members are being asked to do more work with fewer people.

Over 40,000 households and businesses were affected.

Royal Mail says it is bringing in managers from across the country to prevent a backlog.
