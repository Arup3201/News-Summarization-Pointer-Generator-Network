Stunning new images show a glowing full moon slowly disappearing behind a huge mountain.

Businessman and amateur photographer Paul Cyr, 61, from Presque Isle, Maine, USA, captured the beautiful photos showing a 'full worm moon' lining up with Mount Katahdin.

A 'worm moon' gets its name from the local Native American Algonquin tribes. Every March the snow begins to melt, the ground softens and earthworms appear again.

'The chances of lining up the moon perfectly to the tallest mountain in the state, with clear weather - it's very slim,' Mr Cyr said.

'The last time I took photos of a full moon, it was three miles north and the peak was off to the side.

'It doesn't always work, but it worked according to plan and I'm very pleased with the results.'

He added: 'It was about minus 26 degrees centigrade with a 15mph wind, I was frozen solid.

'If you look closely at the pictures you could even see snow blowing on top of the mountain. I had on a head mask, gloves and a two-piece snowmobile suit.'

Mr Cyr braved sub-zero temperatures to get the shots and said the wind was so strong he could see snow blowing off the top of the peak

Mr Cyr needed special protective clothing so he could survive the elements and wait patiently for the perfect shot
