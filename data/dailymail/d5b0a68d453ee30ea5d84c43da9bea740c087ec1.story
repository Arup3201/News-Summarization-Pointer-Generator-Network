A 6-year-old boy has been suspended from a Colorado school for kissing a girl on the cheek.

Hunter Yelton was sent home and remained there Monday after school officials accused the first grader of sexual harassment.

Canon City school officials say no matter his age, what he did fits their school policy code’s description sexual harassment and say the offense will go on his record.

The boy's mother Jennifer Saunders tells KRDO that there was nothing unwanted about her son’s playful kiss.

‘She was fine with it, they are “boyfriend and girlfriend,” said Saunders. ‘The other children saw it and went to the music teacher.’

That’s when Saunders says she was called in to speak with the school principal, who first used the term ‘sexual harassment.’

‘This is taking it to an extreme that doesn't need to be met with a six year old,’ said Saunders.

In fact, the mother said the ordeal has had a detrimental effect on Hunter.

‘Now my son is asking questions… what is sex mommy? That should not ever be said, sex,’ she said. ‘Not in a sentence with a six year old.’

Child clinical psychologist and sexual development specialist Sandy Wurtele agreed and told KRDO the issue should have been handled differently.

'Repeated': Hunter had been in trouble for kissing the girl before. The school said the repeat offense constituted sexual harassment per their policy (pictured) and their sticking with the decision. Hunter was due back in school Tuesday

‘I don't think a six-year-old would understand what harassment is,’ said Wurtele. ‘That has some longer term implications.’

Hunter was suspended once before for kissing the girl and had disciplinary problems, but the girl did not object to being kissed.

A School District RE-1 official said the repeat offenses meet the school policy definition of sexual harassment and they hope the tough standards will force the boy to change his behavior.

Hunter was set to return to school on Tuesday.

Extreme response? Though Hunter admits to his wrongdoing, some adults, including a child psychologist, say the harsh steps taken by the school to punish him were in the extreme
