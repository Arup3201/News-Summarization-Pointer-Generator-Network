Robert F Kennedy Junior will marry actress Cheryl Hines within weeks - despite allegations that he cheated on her, MailOnline can reveal.

It is claimed the environmental lawyer had an affair with Chelsea Kirwan, the estranged wife of surgeon to the stars Laurence Kirwan behind the back of his fiancée Cheryl Hines.

The pair were pictured together at an event in Seattle in April 2013 and their friendship is believed to have spanned the past two years. However, a source confirmed Bobby and Cheryl are most certainly still getting married.

Indeed, the source confirmed that preparations are 'far down the line' for the nuptials, adding: 'There has been no concrete proof of this affair.'

RFK Jf, who is in Cuba on work this week, and Curb Your Enthusiasm star Cheryl are believed to be tying the knot at the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, Mass, this summer, during the family's annual reunion.

Close friends and family, including RFK Jr's mother Ethel Kennedy, 86, will be in attendance.

Cheryl, 48, is said to be extremely close to the Kennedy scion's six children, in particular his teenage daughter Kyra, 19, who has been living with Cheryl in Los Angeles following the tragic death of her mother Mary Richardon in May 2012.

MailOnline told this week how Bobby, 60, and Chelsea, 42, met in a gym in Armonk, New York.

Chelsea, a mother-of-four, is currently going through a bitter divorce from Laurence Kirwan a high-profile surgeon with offices in London, New York and Connecticut.

And a source close to Prof Kirwan, 62, told MailOnline: ‘He was well aware 
that his wife and Bobby had a friendship before their split and that 
they have had ongoing telephone calls.’

It is believed a friendship started well before the Kirwans separated on July 
4, 2012 - and a source reveals how Chelsea’s cell phone records show she was 
speaking to RFK Jr five times a day in August 2012.

The exact nature of Chelsea’s relationship with RFK Jr could well come out in court next month when Prof Kirwan will appeal to try and modify the protection order currently in place over his visitation rights with his three children with Chelsea, 42. The case will be heard on July 22 in Connecticut.

Indeed, a source now tells MailOnline that Prof Kirwan's lawyers could in fact be planning to depose RFK Jr and question him under oath as to the exact nature of his relationship with Chelsea.

RFK
 Jr began dating Cheryl in 2012, months before 
his estranged wife, Mary Richardson, tragically committed suicide in May
 2012 at their Mount Kisco, New York home aged just 52.

The couple are expected to tie the knot this summer during the Kennedys' annual reunion in Hyannis Port.

And asked about their relationship, Cheryl said recently: 
'We share the same values. Family first. We like to have a good time and
 work hard. It’s fun to have a partner...It’s a good match-up.'

Meanwhile, Prof Kirwan and his estranged wife split on July 4, 2012, prompting a bitter divorce.

Then
 in August 2012, the surgeon was charged with attacking Chelsea and his 
step daughter in an angry confrontation at their family home in 
Connecticut, a six-bedroom, $5.9 million property complete with swimming pool.

'We share the same values': Cheryl Hines - pictured with Robert F Kennedy Jr at the Deer Valley Celebrity Skifest in Utah in December 2012 - spoke out about their upcoming marriage, saying: 'It's fun to have a partner. It's a good match up.'

Tragic: RFK Jr with his second wife, Mary Richardon, who killed herself in May 2012. The former couple are seen, left, at a dinner at the Ripple of Hope Gala in NYC in November 2010 - and, right, at the Deer Valley Celebrity Skifest in Utah in December 2008

But he later turned himself in to police, and was arrested and placed in custody.

He
 was charged with third degree assault and disorderly conduct against 
his alleged victims - Chelsea and her daughter Tailor, then 18, now 20.

Admitting to indiscretions,Prof Kirwan nonetheless said: ‘I have the greatest respect for my wife and I 
have tried hard to save my marriage. I still want to do everything 
possible to work it out.’

There
 are now new attorneys working on the divorce case following a mistrial 
and Prof Kirwan and his wife have a court date in September of this 
year.

In November, the 
charges will be dropped as he will have completed his two years 
probation, if he successfully adheres to the protection order and the 
guidelines set by the court.

When reached by MailOnline, Prof Kirwan declined to comment, while Chelsea Kirwan Chapman declined to comment.

While a spokeswoman for Cheryl also declined to comment when contacted.
