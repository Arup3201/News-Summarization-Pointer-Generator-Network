Electronic cigarettes have been aggressively promoted as aids to help people on their way to quitting smoking for good. 

But the preliminary findings of a new major U.S. government study, published on Thursday, into tobacco trends has found that many smokers use the vaporizers to supplement their nicotine habit not to quit.

Dr. Andrew Hyland of the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, New York, who is leading the investigation, suggests that some people simply use the devices as a 'crutch' so they can get a nicotine hits  indoors.

The preliminary findings of a new major U.S. government study into tobacco trends has found that many smokers use electronic cigarettes to supplement their nicotine habit not to quit

His findings were drawn from a pool of 20,000 participants.

A fraction - 28 per cent of adults and nearly nine per cent of youths - reported they currently use any type of tobacco product.

About 40 per cent of those current tobacco users report using two or more products. 

And half say battery-powered e-cigarettes are one of the multiple products they use.

In fact, the most common combination was cigarettes and e-cigarettes.

Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products, said the early findings showing use of more than one type of tobacco product are compelling and underscore 'how popular e-cigarettes have become.'

Ultimately, the PATH study - it stands for Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health - will follow 46,000 people ages 12 and older over five years.

It will serve as a source of information as the FDA decides how to regulate tobacco-related products. 

Policymakers are debating the health effects of 'vaping' as it grows in popularity.

Many anti-smoking advocates consider e-cigarettes a safer alternative for smokers who can't or don't want to quit altogether.

E-cigarettes work by heating liquid nicotine into an inhalable vapor. 

They contain fewer toxic substances than burning traditional cigarettes. 

But health officials warn that they shouldn't be considered harmless and say much more needs to be known about long-term effects.

Critics ask if they keep smokers addicted or even act as a gateway to hook new users who eventually try tobacco. 

Concern about e-cigarettes grew after a different government study in December found some teens who'd never smoked a real cigarette were trying out the electronic kind.

'Is it a passing fancy or something that sticks with them?' Dr. Wilson Compton, deputy director of NIH's National Institute on Drug Abuse, said in an interview with The Associated Press. 

He hopes that over the next few years, the new PATH study will help tell.

The FDA has proposed regulating e-cigarettes, including banning sales to minors, a step that many states already have taken. 

No one knows if experimenting with e-cigarettes poses as much risk of hooking someone as experimenting with regular cigarettes, Compton said.

Nicotine levels vary widely by type of e-cigarette, from small amounts to nearly as much as a traditional cigarette, he said. 

Users learn to puff a bit differently as they draw in vapor, and even the voltage in the device's wires may affect nicotine delivery, he explained. 

NIDA plans to fund development of what Compton calls a "standard e-cigarette" that will be a yardstick for comparison with the different e-cigarettes on the market.
