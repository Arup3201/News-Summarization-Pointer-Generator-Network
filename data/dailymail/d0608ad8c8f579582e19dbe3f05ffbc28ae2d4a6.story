Ivory Coast captain Toure made his international debut back in 2004 whilst playing for Metalurg Donetsk in Ukraine and has appeared in the last three World Cups.

After the Elephants sealed their place in January's tournament, fans invaded the pitch at full-time sparking dramatic scenes.

Visitors Cameroon had Stephane Mbia sent off just before the hour mark in Abidjan, and the match ended in farcical circumstances with the Ivorian players  passing the ball around in defence as their opposition - who had already qualified - showed no desire to win possession.

At the full-time whistle Ivory Coast fans ran onto the pitch to celebrate their side's qualification success, with pictures emerging of supporters pulling the crossbar down at one end of the pitch.
