Robbie Keane scored an extra-time winner to hand Landon Donovan the perfect retirement present as the Los Angeles Galaxy beat the New England Revolution 2-1 to claim the MLS Cup.

The Irishman was named the MLS' most valuable player last week and lived up to that billing with a dramatic winner in a contest when he and side were not at their best.

Gyasi Zardes had put the Galaxy ahead, but Chris Tierney grabbed the equaliser to take the final to extra-time where Keane netted his 20th goal of the season.

As for Donovan, the 32-year-old brought down the curtain on a career which has seen him become the league's all-time top goalscorer with a sixth MLS Cup.

Victory gave the Galaxy a record fifth Cup, beating the Revolution in the final for a third time.

The Galaxy took the lead in the 52nd minute when Stefan Ishizaki whipped in a cross from the right and Zardes did brilliantly to take three touches on his right foot, keep two defenders at bay, and fire into the far corner with his left.

Keane had a golden opportunity to add a second in the 70th minute when he burst forward and got one-on-one with Bobby Shuttleworth, but his toe-poke finish was saved by the goalkeeper.

And the Galaxy were made to pay in the 79th minute as a long ball down the left was gathered by Patrick Mullins, who squared a pass for Tierney to apply a smart finish and level things up, thus sending the game to extra-time.

Extra-time was predictably tetchy, but, when a long ball came over the top, Keane kept onside, bore down on goal and side-footed home to seal glory with a characteristically cool finish.

After the match Keane expressed his delight on the win when speaking to ESPN saying: 'It was a tough game.  think there was a lot of nerves there by both teams.

'We didn't play as well as we know we can at home but it doesn't really matter now. At the end of the day we won and we're the champions again.

'I've been here for four years and I've won three championships, so so far it's been fantastic. I've enjoyed it. Let's see what happens next.'
