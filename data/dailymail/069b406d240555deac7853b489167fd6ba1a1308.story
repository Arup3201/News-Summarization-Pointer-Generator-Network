Brazilian World Cup host city Manaus has declared a state of emergency as the waters of an Amazon River tributary swell, although officials say they do not expect it to flood.

Manaus city hall spokeswoman Jacira Oliveira said the 180-day state of emergency that came into effect on Tuesday is a preventive measure to assure swift access to emergency resources if the Rio Negro unexpectedly spills into the city.

She assured fans that even if there are floods, they will not damage the Arena Amazonia stadium which will host four games.

Worrying: Water levels rose above the safe limit in Manaus just two years ago and barriers had to be built

Friendly locals: Manaus is littered with povert-stricken slum areas like this one

Venue: The Arena da Amazonia in Manaus will host England's opening World Cup group game with Italy

Repeat? Local officials are confident that Manaus will not be flooded, despite a similar incident in 2012

England's World Cup opener against Italy will take place in Manaus on June 14, when the temperature is likely to be around 32 degrees.

Roy Hodgson's squad have been training in Portugal to help acclimatise to the warm weather, with players even wearing extra clothing to get used to the sort of conditions which await them against the Azzurri in less than a month.

The Three Lions face Peru in a friendly at Wembley on Friday before flying to Miami to take on Ecuador and Honduras in the Florida sun.
