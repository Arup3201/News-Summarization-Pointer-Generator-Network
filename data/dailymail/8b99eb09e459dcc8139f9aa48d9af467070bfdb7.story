Shopping: Persistently high food prices have contributed to a rise in inflation in August

Families are being hit by the biggest increase in the price of clothes for more than three decades, figures revealed yesterday.

Average price tags on clothes and shoes have soared by 13.2 per cent in the last year, according to the Office for National Statistics.

This is the biggest annual rise recorded since 1980 and comes at a time when families are facing an unprecedented attack on their finances.

Overall, the ONS figures showed the consumer prices index measure of inflation rose to 4.5 per cent last month, from 4.4 per cent in July. This is more than double the Government’s inflation target of 2 per cent, and means inflation is higher in Britain than any other G7 country.

The rise in clothes costs  means a pair of jeans priced at £20 in August last year now costs an extra £2.64.

Many retailers warned last year that the surging price of cotton due to extreme weather in Pakistan and China would lead to higher prices in shops.

Earlier this year, the price of 
cotton hit the highest level –  in relative terms – since the American 
Civil War, but has dropped sharply recently. However, this will take 
time to feed through to the high street.

The bleak outlook for families is made worse by the paltry pay rise, or pay freezes, they are being forced to accept.

A typical private sector worker is getting a pay rise of just 2.6 per cent.

Public sector workers are in the middle of a two-year pay freeze if they earn £21,000 or more.

And nearly all bills from energy to 
fuel, clothes to food are rising far faster than their pay, plunging 
millions of families into debt.

One of the biggest bills – the weekly
food shop – has also ballooned, with food and soft drink prices jumping
6.2 per cent over the last year. To make matters worse, economists 
predicted yesterday that inflation will keep on rising, although few say
pay rises will too.

Andrew Goodwin, senior economic 
adviser at the accountant Ernst & Young’s Item Club, said: ‘There is
probably worse to come in the short-term.’ He blamed double-digit hikes
in energy bills, with many families paying a record-breaking £1,300 a 
year to heat their homes.

The situation is far worse for older 
people who are hit harder by inflation than any other age group, 
according to old age specialists Saga.

Since the credit crunch began in 
2007, it said prices have risen by 13.9 per cent for the average person,
but by 19 per cent for those aged 75 and over.

This is because old people spend more of their money on costs which are rising the fastest, such as food and energy.

Inflation is also wiping out their savings with rates as low as 0.01 per cent.

Dr Ros Altmann, director general of Saga, said: ‘Older people are trapped.

‘They cannot cope with living costs rocketing through the roof. Are they expected just to sit, wait and suffer?’

Unions leaders said yesterday that high inflation is further evidence of the squeeze in living standards.

Brendan Barber, general secretary of 
the Trades Union Congress, said: ‘Those who did least to cause the crash
are bearing the biggest burden in clearing up the mess.’

n As the cost of living continues to surge, so does the cost of dying, a survey revealed.

End-of-life costs – including 
funerals, headstones and flowers – increased to an average of £7,248, up
20 per cent since 2007, according to the Annual Cost of Dying Report.

Funeral bills have increased by 61 per cent over the past seven years and will continue to rise, according to the annual survey.
