An NHS hospital has been found guilty of making bogus claims about the benefits of hypnosis for serious medical conditions.

The Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine has been told to withdraw a leaflet it issued promoting hypnosis treatment for a number of conditions including mental health problems and irritable bowel syndrome.

The hospital, whose patron is the Queen, is part of the group of University College London Hospitals NHS trust and calls itself the largest public sector provider of integrated medicine in Europe.

The Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine has been told to withdraw a leaflet promoting hypnosis treatment for serious conditions

Apart from hypnosis, its clinicians offer various alternative medical therapies including homeopathy and acupuncture.

A leaflet issued by the London hospital headed ‘Medical and Clinical Hypnosis’  made a number of impressive claims for the treatment.

It boasted: ‘Hypnosis can benefit almost anyone to improve their physical, emotional and mental health.’

It then went on to provide a long list of conditions which it could help alleviate including problems with the immune, nervous and gastro-intestinal systems.

The leaflet said hypnosis could also help sufferers with conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and dyspepsia.

The benefits of hypnosis were questioned by a campaigning group called the Nightingale Collaboration which was set up to challenge claims made for quack treatments.

It made a formal complaint to the Advertising Standards Authority(ASA), which ruled that most of the hospital’s claims for hypnotherapy could not be substantiated.

The hospital provided a raft of clinical studies and research papers to back up their claims, however these failed to satisfy the advertising watchdog.

Its decision calls into question the use of hypnosis in the NHS, where millions of pounds of public money is spent offering the controversial therapy.

The ASA said there is evidence that hypnotherapy can help relieve anxiety, confidence issues and minor skin conditions, but it said the hospital was wrong to make wider claims about improving mental and physical health.

It said most of the trials and studies presented by the hospital to justify its claims were too small to provide meaningful conclusions.

‘We concluded that the claim ‘Hypnosis can benefit almost anyone to improve their physical, emotional and mental health’ exaggerated the potential benefit to patients’ mental and physical health and was therefore misleading,’ it said.

Similarly, the hospital was unable to provide convincing evidence of benefits for the immune, nervous or gastro-intestinal systems.

The ASA did side with the hospital over claims that hypnosis can help people cope with the effects of chronic pain, such as headaches, cancer pain and rheumatism.

However, it banned the hospital from issuing the leaflet again and told executives to make sure that they have ‘robust evidence’ to substantiate medical claims in any future publications.

It said: ‘In summary, we considered that the body of evidence provided by RLHIM, as a whole, had supported the notion that hypnotherapy might help people to cope with and manage pain, and with perceived relief of pain.

‘However, we considered that the leaflet had misleadingly implied more: that hypnotherapy could treat or cure the conditions listed, an interpretation for which we had not seen suitably robust evidence.’

The hospital said it took the ASA ruling ‘very seriously’. It added: ‘We will make the necessary changes to bring our patient information in line with their guidance. In the meantime we have withdrawn the leaflet concerned and have amended our website accordingly.’

Two unrelated adverts which referred to Jimmy Savile have been ruled harmful and offensive following complaints that they made light of allegations of sexual abuse against the disgraced TV presenter.

An email for clothing company DirtySmart read 'Choose your fate' with arrows pointing to a cartoon image of Savile.

One person complained that the ad was offensive and irresponsible because it made light of the allegations under investigation.

Another email for Extreme Publishing read 'How's about that then' in large print above a black and white image of Savile wearing underwear and smoking a cigar with a superimposed copy of a magazine in his hand.

Two complainants challenged whether the ad was offensive and irresponsible in view of recent media coverage surrounding the abuse allegations.

DirtySmart acknowledged that some people may have found the cartoon image of Savile distasteful but they considered it would not cause serious or widespread offence.

Extreme Publishing, trading as TBM Magazine, said it did not intend to offend or upset anyone by sending the email.

The (ASA) said the adverts were likely to cause serious offence to some.

It said:  'We told them to ensure they prepared their ads with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society, and to ensure they did not cause serious or widespread offence.' 

A campaign for Rowse honey has been banned for making a 'misleading' claim that it is a natural source of slow release energy.

The television advert, which screened in April last year, featured a boy squeezing honey on to his porridge before heading off to school where he was shown playing football and participating in lessons, while a voiceover said: 'Rowse honey is a natural source of slow release energy for busy boys and girls.'

Nine viewers complained that the slow release energy claim was misleading.

Defending the ad, Rowse said it believed the term 'slow release energy' implied the energy was delivered more slowly than a comparable food or ingredient.

It believed Rowse honey qualified for the claim because it was a significant source of fructose, pointing out that the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) had said that 'fructose is more slowly absorbed in the gastro-intestinal tract than glucose'.

However the ASA said it understood from its own expert foods were deemed to have a low GI when the value was 55 or below, noting that the Rowse test gave a value of between 50 and 60.

It said: 'Because the ad did not make clear that the consumption of Rowse honey led to a lower blood glucose rise than the consumption of sucrose or glucose-containing foods, we concluded that the claim was misleading and therefore breached the Code.'

It ruled: 'The ad must not be broadcast again in its current form.'
