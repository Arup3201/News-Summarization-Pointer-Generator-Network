Support: Mr Shapps has backed controversial proposals for a third runway at Heathrow

A Tory minister risks stoking Coalition tensions after signalling support for a third runway at Heathrow.

Grant Shapps, a housing and planning minister, said Britain must consider building the runway if it is to remain a ‘great trading nation’.

David Cameron promised not to build a third runway before the election in a bid to attract green voters from the Lib Dems.

But in recent months the Tories have been wavering - fearing the decision could have hurt the British economy. The Lib Dems remain vociferously opposed.

In an interview with The Telegraph, Mr Shapps said ‘all options’ for expanding airport capacity in the South East need to be examined to help kick-start the economy.

The minister is the first to speak out publicly on the issue.

Chancellor George Osborne is also thought to share this view. With the economy flatlining, business leaders are calling for either the expansion of Heathrow or for a new airport east of London.

His comments raise the prospect the Tories could abandon their opposition to a third runway as part of the 2015 manifesto.

Mr Shapps, an amateur pilot, said: ‘As a great trading nation we need to have sufficient numbers of ports to get people and goods in and out.

‘I back the Chancellor’s position to the hilt when he said in the Budget we clearly need to review the airport capacity in the South East.

‘All the options need to be considered while being mindful of our election manifesto.’

The minister, who is tipped for promotion in David Cameron's forthcoming reshuffle, is understood to be among a growing number of senior Tories who believe the PM should perform a public U-turn on the third runway.

'Untenable' position: It has been suggested Transport Secretary Justine Greening could be moved from her post due to her stance on the runway

Meanwhile Conservative sources have suggested Transport Secretary Justine Greening could lose her post in the planned September reshuffle because of her long-held opposition to the expansion at Heathrow.

Senior party members said that, with George Osborne now in favour of the plans, Ms Greening's stance on the third runway meant she would not be able to remain in position as Transport Secretary.

However the suggestion was dismissed by others who pointed out that opposing the runway was Government policy.

Mr Cameron said last month that Government policy would not be changing, but Richard Wellings, head of transport at the Institute of Economic Affairs, said Ms Greening's position was 'untenable'.

'It's a problem having her as Transport Secretary with such a local interest in the issue; given her critical views on Heathrow expansion, it would make sense to replace her,' he told the Financial Times.

Ms Greening came to prominence campaigning as a backbencher in her Putney constituency as one of the main opponents of the third runway.

The plans for expansion were ardently opposed by people living around the airport, particularly in the village of Sipson, which would be wiped out if the plans were given the green light.

A consultation on airport capacity in the South East has twice been delayed as a result of Government infighting.

Earlier this month Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, accused the Government of 'pussy-footing around' on the issue of London's airport crisis.

Housing Minister Mr Shapps also indicated in the interview that he is opposed to possible Treasury proposals to further deregulate the planning system.

Sources at the Treasury have indicated that they would consider looking again at the National Planning Policy Framework, and possibly allowing building on the green belt.

Mr Shapps said there is no need to build on the green belt.

'We're not short of schemes to get housing built, we just need to get out there, roll our sleeves up and get developments going,' he said.

'It's not the case that we'll never need to do another piece of planning reform. But let's concentrate on what we've got.

'We've got nearly half a million planning applications ready or nearly ready.'
