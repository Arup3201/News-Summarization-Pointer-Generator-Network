Pope Francis lived up to his role as the shepherd of God's flock when he was given a lamb to carry on his shoulders.

The pontiff was visiting the parish of St Alphonso Maria de ‘Liguori, in the district of Justine, on the outskirts of Rome when an onlooker placed the animal over his neck.

He was at the site to spend the afternoon of the Epiphany festival there where parishioners had set up a special nativity scene.

Holy: Pope Francis, the shepherd of God's flock, had a real lamb draped over his neck when he visited a nativity scene

Cheerful: The head of the Catholic church grinned as a woman dressed in her nativity costume presented him with the tiny creature during the visit to Justine on the outskirts of Rome

Local people had recreated Bethlehem at the time of Jesus's birth, with shops, stalls, inns and other scenes of everyday life.

Pope Francis ended his visit with a visit to the stable where he blessed a two month old child in a manger.

Epiphany
 is a joyous day for Catholics in which they recall the journey of the 
three kings, or Magi, to pay homage to Baby Jesus.

The Vatican's Secretary of State sent a letter to its embassies asking them to inform bishops' conferences of the change.

From now on, the Vatican reported Tuesday, only diocesan priests who are 'chaplains of the Holy Father,'  can use the honorific, and then only after they turn 65. 

Bishops, vicars and archbishops still get to be called 'monsignor' and Holy See officials will have the title if their office warrants it. 

The Vatican noted that Pope Paul VI reduced the number of ecclesiastic honorifics in 1968 and that Francis' decision 'should be taken in this vein, as a further simplification.'

Changes: The Pope's furry encounter came as it revealed her had done away with the honorific title 'monsignor' for all but a few priests
