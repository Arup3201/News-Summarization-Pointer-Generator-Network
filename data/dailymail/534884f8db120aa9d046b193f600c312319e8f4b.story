Smoking is still considered cool by children trying to be popular, new research suggests.

The news comes as a blow to the increasingly widespread anti-smoking message as study author Professor Thomas Valente said that not enough has been done to make not smoking cool.

Shockingly, almost 70 per cent of adult smokers started at age 18 or younger and almost 3,900 children under 18 try their first cigarette every day, according to the American Lung Association.

Considered cool: Popular teenagers tend to smoke and influence others to take it up in order to fit in, new research found

Popular teenagers tend to smoke and influence others to take up the deadly habit in an effort to fit in and be liked, the new research found.

The study also found that students’ perceptions of their peers’ behaviour mattered just as much as whether or not they actually smoked.

According to Hispanically Speaking News, Prof Valente said: ‘Popularity is a strong predictor of smoking.

‘We haven’t done enough to make it cool not to smoke.’

The findings from Prof Valente, a professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine, confirms trends of smoking students in sixth through to 12th grade across America and in Mexico.

Researchers found that the most popular students in ninth and tenth grade at seven predominantly Hispanic and Latino high schools in southern California were more likely to smoke cigarettes than other students.

Warning parents: Study author Professor Thomas Valente warned parents to be wary of encouraging their children to fit in. 'There's a liability to that,' he said

‘It’s the popularity that’s a risk 
factor for smoking, and it’s very disturbing,’ Dr Norman Edelman, chief 
medical officer for the American Lung Association and a professor of 
preventive medicine at Stony Brook University, in New York said.

Prof Valente warned parents to be wary of encouraging their children to fit in at school.

He said: ‘We always want our kids to be popular, but there’s a liability to that. 

‘By being popular you’re more aware of other things that are happening around you and you want to be sure to retain that popularity, which in and of itself is stressful.’

Researchers asked 1,950 student whether they had tried smoking and how frequently they had smoked in the past month. They were also asked about the smoking habits of their peers and how they thought their friends felt about smoking.

The conclusions, published in the Journal of Adolescent Health on Wednesday reported that of ninth grade students, 25.6 per cent and 28.1 per cent of tenth graders admitted to smoking.

In another recent study from Colombia University, about 17 per cent of American high school students admit to drinking, smoking or taking drugs during the school day.

According to Cancer Research UK, one in eight British children become regular smokers by the age of 15 and trying just one cigarette can make children more likely to start smoking several years later.
