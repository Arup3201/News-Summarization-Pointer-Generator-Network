The husband of the teacher who cheated on him with her teenage students has vowed to stand by his 'wonderful, beautiful' wife during her stint in prison and rebuild his marriage once she is released.

In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, Raphael Cooper said he realizes his wife made mistakes but he forgave her months ago.

Wyoming Valley West High School English teacher Lauren Harrington-Cooper, 32, pleaded guilty last week to having sex with two students and flashing her breasts at a third. She was immediately jailed for a term of between nine and 23 months.

Forgiveness: Cooper posted his most recent profile picture of the couple at the Parker Hill Community Church in Wilkes-Barre on September 15, the day after their baptism, knowing that within two weeks his wife would be imprisoned for having sex with her students

Sentenced: Lauren pleaded guilty last week and was immediately jailed for up to 23 months

Teacher's pet: Cooper told MailOnline that his wife will probably go into the dog grooming business once she is released from the Luzerne County Correctional Facility. She will no longer be able to teach

Now her husband, a dance school owner who once waltzed with Selena Gomez on the teen show 'Wizards of Waverly Place,' says he finds life is lonely without the woman he called the love of his life.

Speaking on the doorstep of his home in Kingston, Pennsylvania, which backs on to the road opposite the football stadium where the Wyoming Valley West Spartans play their home games, Cooper, 32, said: 'She's a good person, but mistakes were made.

'Some of the things you have read are not true, but a plea is a plea, so I am not going to go into details.

'It's a very difficult situation.

'It's sad but we still have the hopes and dreams that we had when we first married,' Cooper, who is also a high school English teacher, added.

He said there is no chance of the couple splitting up over Lauren's affairs with her students.

'She has always been a big support to me and I love this person. We are way past forgiveness, all we are doing now is focusing on our future.'

Lauren resigned her job in January and has now had her teacher's license yanked. She will never be able to teach again as she has had to register as a sex offender.

Her husband said she will probably go into the dog grooming business once she is released from the Luzerne County Correctional Facility.

Cooper said he hasn't yet seen his wife in jail, but only because his visiting hours have not come up yet.

Harrington-Cooper was arrested in December after the parents of an 18-year-old student at her school in Plymouth, Pennsylvania, a 15-minute drive from her home, found inappropriate texts from her on the texting site 'Pinger.'

'When reviewing the text messages, the parents found their son was having a sexually explicit conversation with this school teacher,' the police affidavit reads. 'In the messages, the teacher is identified as Lauren with having Crohn's Disease, being a vegetarian and teaching 8th period in Room 401.'

Harrington-Cooper had first met the boy after texting his sister, telling her she thought he was 'hot.' They had intercourse twice and she gave him oral sex three times, the affidavit says.

Authorities later charged her with giving oral sex to a 17-year-old student. She was also charged with two counts of corrupting minors — boys aged 16 and 17. She flashed her breasts at one and 'had sexual contact' with the other.

Police claim she told one student in class: 'All the candy you want is right here.'

In a letter to Luzerne County Judge Michael Vough, Harrington-Cooper said she accepted responsibility for her actions and would use her time in prison to reflect on what she had done. She also apologized to the boys.

Her attorney Joe D'Andrea told Vough that Harrington-Cooper suffered from 'self-image issues of acceptance and love.'

Devoted: Last year Cooper posted a picture of them together with the caption: 'Loving every minute with my wonderful, beautiful wife, Lauren'

Two to tango: Cooper runs a dance academy and Lauren taught there as well

'She has been diagnosed with some significant psychological issues of inadequacy,' the lawyer said. 'You would think that she’s a pretty, young girl, that she would feel good about herself. But her self-esteem issues have really troubled her all of her life, and she found comfort and solace in some people giving her attention, as wrong as it was.' 

He said the case had strained her marriage and she wanted the case to be over quickly. 'She acted out on some serious impulses and hopefully therapy and some other things will help her through this.'

Raphael Cooper confirmed that his wife of seven years is in therapy and said that they have both become more religious since the case first came to light. 'We were both baptized recently,' he said. 'She is in the bible a lot.'

On his Facebook page, Raphael Cooper, who teaches in nearby Wilkes-Barre, still shows many pictures of him with his wife. He posted his most recent profile picture of the couple at the Parker Hill Community Church in Wilkes-Barre on September 15, the day after their baptism, knowing that within two weeks his wife would be imprisoned.

Lessons learned: One of the 17-year-old victims told cops he began texting her last fall. On one occasion, he said, he picked her up from her home, drove her around for 90 minutes then returned to her home and sat kissing in the car.

'I knew she would go to jail,' he said 'It is not a terribly lengthy sentence, but it is very difficult,' he said. Judge Vough gave her the relatively lenient sentence at the request of the boys she had trysts with.

On their wedding anniversary in August, he posted: 'My wife surprises me at a friends house with a thoughtful picnic w homemade food for our anniversary. Happy 7th! We have been through a lot! I love you, Lauren! Many more to come.'

Last year he posted a picture of them together with the caption: 'Loving every minute with my wonderful, beautiful wife, Lauren.'

Cooper said that despite his wife's unfaithfulness being big news, he has not been teased by his students. 'I have had great support from them, from the administration and the faculty,' he said.

Cooper's devotion to his wife comes despite her brazenness. One of the 17-year-olds told cops he began texting her last fall. On one occasion, he said, he picked her up from her home, drove her around for 90 minutes then returned to her home and sat kissing in the car.

Another time she performed oral sex on him in a car on a residential street.
