Savers with over 100,000 euros deposited in the Bank of Cyprus could now be hit for losses of up to 60 per cent, according to a central bank official and a senior finance ministry technocrat.

The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they're not authorized to publicly discuss details of the issue, said deposits over 100,000 euros at the country's largest lender will lose 37.5 percent of their value after being converted into bank shares.

They said that savers could then lose up to 22.5 per cent more, depending on an assessment by officials who will determine the exact figure aimed at restoring the troubled bank back to health.

Cyprus crisis: Deposits over 100,000 euros will lose 37.5 percent of their value after being converted into bank shares and savers could then lose up to 22.5 per cent more, according to two anonymous insiders

Cyprus agreed Monday to make depositors 
contribute to a financial rescue in order to secure 10 billion euros 
($12.9 billion) in loans from the eurozone and the IMF.

On Wednesday night, five shipping containers filled with billions of Euros are reported to have been flown to Cyprus from Frankfurt and delivered to the island’s central bank to ensure money did not run out.

A helicopter and police cars guarded the armoured cash convoy, thought to have been sent by the European Central Bank, on its way from the airport.

Strict new rules have been imposed to stop a run on Cyprus banks which yesterday opened for the first time since the island’s economic meltdown started nearly a fortnight ago.

Banks in Cyprus opened for normal business for a second day but with strict restrictions on how much money people could withdraw while the International Monetary Fund said Slovenia's banks 'are under severe distress'

Airports are now searching passengers 
and stopping anyone trying to leave the country with more than 1000 
euros (£845) and daily cash machine withdrawals are limited to 300 euros
 (£250).

Cyprus was yesterday still reeling 
from its bailout plans with British expat pensioners struggling to pay 
for food and bills as banks refuse to release their UK pension payments.

Former NHS nurse Diane 
Ameur-Zaimeche, 71, said of her £400-a-month pension: ‘I’ve been told 
all money being sent to Cyprus is being sat on by the government’s 
Central Bank.’

President Nicos Anastasiades said yesterday risk of bankruptcy had been contained and Cyprus had no intention of leaving the euro.

Analysts are increasingly sceptical Slovenia will be able to raise £2.5billion to keep running in the wake of Cyprus's £8.5billion bailout

Slovenia’s recently elected prime 
minister Alenka Bratusek insisted her country should not be compared to 
Cyprus. ‘Our banking system is stable and safe,’ she said.

But the IMF said: ‘The new government 
should promptly address bank restructuring, corporate sector debt 
overhang and governance and involvement of the state in the economy.’

Economists polled by Reuters said Slovenia and Spain were now the two eurozone nations most likely to need a bailout.
