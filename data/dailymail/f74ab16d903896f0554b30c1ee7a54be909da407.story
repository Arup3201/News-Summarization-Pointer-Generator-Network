England ended the Nike International Tournament in style with a 2-1 win over Australia in Florida on Tuesday evening, with West Ham hitman Jahmal Hector-Ingram grabbing the winner late on.

England took the lead early on through Ike Ugbo, with captain Adam Phillips finding the Chelsea man down the right before he turned inside and lashed past the Socceroos goalkeeper.

The Australian's drew level in the second-half thanks to Cameron Joyce, latching onto Peter Kekeris' pullback from the right to fire home.

England then nearly found the lead through matchwinner Hector-Ingram, going through one-on-one with Australian stopper James Delianov, but only to see his shot deflected clear.

Hector-Ingram caused plenty of problems in Sarasota, teeing up Manchester City's Will Patching, who shot over, before shooting straight at Delianov himself.

But England finally found their winner on 76 minutes, the West Ham forward meeting Derby County right-back Kyron Stabana's far-post cross with a volley.

Brazil won the tournament having defeated hosts USA, who finished second, 4-1 later on Tuesday evening. England finished third, one point behind USA.
