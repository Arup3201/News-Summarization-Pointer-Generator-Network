A Rhode Island TV reporter who unwittingly rose to fame when her report about how to survive a bear attack went viral has been fired after doing a handstand on-air.

Julie Tremmel, 36, was reporting for NBC affiliate WJAR-TV on the Providence area auditions for America's Got Talent and performed a handstand as part of the lighthearted piece.

Apparently her latest gymnastics were too much for the station, and she was fired days after the puff piece aired last month.

Roving reporter: Julie Tremmel winding up her piece on 'America's Got Talent' auditions

Talented: Tremmel tells viewers that she can't sing or dance but she can do gymnastics before launching into a handstand

On her head: Tremmel finishes off her report from an upside down position, but doesn't break her flow

'I was terminated without cause from WJAR and my Union and I are fighting it through the grievance and arbitration process in our Contract with the Station (sic),' Tremmel told GoLocal Prov in an email.

'That is all I'm prepared to say at this time.'

Tremmel first caused a stir when her unintentionally comical bear piece made her a viral internet star.

As GoLocal Prov reports, the bear piece's popularity did not go down well with some of the station's more senior staff members.

Jim Taricani, WJAR's veteran investigative reporter posted a comment on Facebook obviously directed at Tremmel, saying  '...some tv reporters like to draw attention to themselves...its an insult to most of us trying to be professional (sic).'

Peppy: Tremmel's reports were full of her upbeat enthusiasm

He also called the bear piece a 'smudge on our station's reputation.'

In her latest report to ruffle feathers, Tremmel says, 'So I got to thinking. I had a chance to meet a huge LA and New York City producer today and I had absolutely no skills to show him. I don’t dance and I don’t sing, but I do do gymnastics!

'So I thought, to the producers watching at home tonight,” she continues, performing a handstand, 'how about a news reporter that does the news while she’s walking on her hands?'

Since news of Tremmel's dismissal broke, social media has been flooded with message of support for her and wonder at how a handstand could have resulted in her firing.

'I don't see how, if you're doing a story on "America's Got Talent" auditions, that this is out of line,' wrote one.

A 'Support News Reporter Julie Tremmel' Facebook page has received 319 likes and an online 'Bring Julie Tremmel Back to NBC 10' petition so far has 238 signatures.

Going overboard: The station has not said why Tremmel's handstand report got her fired

Bridge too far: Tremmel is fighting her dismissal from the station

Tremmel's report for the station last year about how to survive a bear attack received widespread publicity when it went viral.

Her report opens with a warning, based on expert advice, on 
what you should do if you come across a 'curious 300lb bear.'

The glamorous blond then proceeds to demonstrate with enthusiasm, the correct steps to take in such an event.

It was covered by websites from the Huffington Post to BuzzFeed and a Fox affiliate in Michigan mocked the piece by remixing it to Robin Thicke’s 'Blurred Lines,' and Jimmy Fallon featured it in full on the Tonight Show.

Wilderness survival 101: 'How to survive a bear attack' by Rhode Island reporter Julie Tremmel

Top tips: Don't make eye contact  with the bear (especially like this) and for goodness sake, stay quiet!

Survival of the fittest: Back away slowly, especially if you have entered deep into the woods in full make-up, sandals and a garish top

Take that! Deter the 300lb bear... by throwing a sandal at it

Nap time? The reporter advises to curl up in a ball if the bear attacks (or if you are made to do cringeworthy news reports)

And finally... Lie down in the grass and head your face in your shame
