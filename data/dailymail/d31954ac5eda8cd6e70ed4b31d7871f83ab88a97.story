A 17th century Grade II listed mansion that inspired DH Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover has gone on the market for £1million.

The stunning Teversal Manor, near Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, was put on sale by owners Janet and John Marples after they spend more than a decade restoring it.

In DH Lawrence's 1928 tale, Constance Chatterley creeps from Wragby Hall, the home she shares with her paralysed husband Clifford, at night to conduct an affair with gamekeeper Oliver Mellors.

The country house widely thought to have been the inspiration behind Wragby Hall in DH Lawrence's notorious novel, Lady Chatterley's Lover, is up for sale - for £1million

Properly known as Teversal Manor, the six-bedroom house is said to be the inspiration for Wragby Hall in Lady Chatterley's Lover and is referenced many times in the 1928 novel

Fans of DH Lawrence can buy a slice of literary history for the princely sum of £1million

The kitchen: During the First World War the house was used for the rehabilitation of soldiers

The book achieved infamy for its story of a physical relationship between a working-class man and an upper-class woman, its graphic descriptions of sex, and its use of words considered shocking at the time.

It caused a storm upon its release, and the original could not be published in Britain until 1960.

Lawrence, who was born in Eastwood, Nottinghamshire, is believed to have been inspired by the six-bedroom Teversal Manor while walking around the area of his childhood.

It is located in Teversal old village, known as 'Tevershall' in Lawrence's book.

DH Lawrence's book caused a storm upon its release, and an unexpurgated version could not be published in Britain until 1960

Mrs Marples and her husband, 72-year-old John, have lived in the manor for 19 years and have lovingly restored much of the property

In the book, Wragby Hall is where Constance Chatterley lives with her paralysed husband Clifford and it's from which she creeps at night to visit her working class lover

Mrs Marples, 69, said: 'During the First World War, the house was used for the rehabilitation of soldiers.

'They put a slope down to the second garden terrace for wheelchairs and it's said Lawrence got the idea for Constance's husband Clifford from that, as he was in a wheelchair.'

Mrs Marples and her husband, 72-year-old John, have lived in the manor for 19 years and have lovingly restored much of the property and almost acres of grounds.

Danielle Darrieux and Erno Crisa starred in a 1956 film adaptation of Lady Chatterley's Lover

First
published in 1928, DH Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover was banned in 
the UK for more than 30 years because of its sexually explicit scenes 
and use of profane four-letter words.

But when the full unexpurgated 
edition was published by Penguin Books in Britain in 1960, the publisher
was taken to court under the Obscene Publications Act 1959.

The trial became a major public event and a test of the new obscenity law. The new Act had allowed publishers to escape conviction if they could show that a work was of literary merit.

So Penguin printed off 200,000 copies and challenged the Director of Public Prosecutions to take the company to court. But when it did, the jury decided in favour of Penguin and within a year it had sold two million copies.

The Penguin second edition, 
published in 1961, contained a publisher's dedication, which read: 'For 
having published this book, Penguin Books were prosecuted under the 
Obscene Publications Act, 1959 at the Old Bailey in London from 20 
October to 2 November 1960.

'This edition is therefore 
dedicated to the twelve jurors, three women and nine men, who returned a
verdict of 'Not Guilty' and thus made DH Lawrence's last novel 
available for the first time to the public in the United Kingdom.'

Lady C, as it became known, has 
spawned a number of films and TV dramas, with perhaps the most famous 
being the 1993 BBC TV adaptation starring Sean Bean and Joely Richardson and directed by Ken Russell.

She added: 'We've done an awful lot of 
work to it, it only had four radiators when we moved in.

'It was divided 
up with doors blocked off and we opened it back up again. We still get a lot of letters from people who are interested in the history of the property.

'It
needs someone who's going to love it again and is happy to put money 
into it. They need to care for it and keep it as it should be and not 
spoil its history.'

Other figures from history with links to Teversal Manor include Lord and Lady Carnarvon, who lived there in the late 1800s.

Another regular visitor at Teversal was the author Virginia Woolf, who spent time there recuperating.

Patrick Williamson, of Savills Estate 
Agents, who is marketing the property, believes the house's historical 
significance makes it attractive to buyers.

Restored: Owner Janet Marples, 69, said: 'We've done an awful lot of work to it, it only had four radiators when we moved in'

He said: 'The house has the feeling and presence that you can only get from a historical building of this sort of size.

'It would make a great wedding venue with its location next to the church.'

'It requires someone to buy it who's going to want to take on a very significant building and the work that comes along with that.'
