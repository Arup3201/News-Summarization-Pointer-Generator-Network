Seven severed heads have been found stuffed in plastic bags on the edge of a highway near the second largest city in Mexico.

The gruesome discovery about 25 miles from the city of Guadalajara, Jalisco state is a reminder of the criminal violence still plaguing Mexico.

This comes despite assurances from the government that the murder rate is falling.

More than 60,000 people died in violence linked to warring drug cartels during the 2006-2012 presidency of Felipe Calderon. 

An average of 1,000 people per month have been killed under his successor, Enrique Pena Nieto, who took office December.

Jalisco, the home of tequila and mariachi music, has been hard hit by the ongoing violence.

Murders were up more than 5 percent during the first five months of this year compared with the same period a year ago, according to Mexican police.

The bodies of two schoolboys suspected of bullying the son of a powerful drug trafficker were found in Jalisco this week.

In March Jalisco's tourism minister was shot dead in Guadalajara just a week after taking office.

Jose de Jesus Gallegos Alvarez was shot by a 9mm pistol while driving in a suburb.

Two teenagers boys were also found dead,
 allegedly killed after making fun of a boy in their class that was the 
son of a drug dealer.

They were found buried in a wood just outside of Guadalajara.

Last year, mayor Maria Santos Gorrostieta was abducted and murdered by a drug cartel.

It was the third assassination attempt on the outspoken politician.

The 36-year-old was hauled from her vehicle and physically assaulted as horrified witnesses watched.

She is described as having begged for her child to be left alone and then appeared to get into her abductors’ car willingly.

She left behind her daughter and two sons as well as her second husband Nereo Delgado Patinoran.
