A five-year-old boy went missing from school to go and buy a toy - and when his mother discovered he had disappeared, teachers asked her not to call the police.

Alfie Quest was allowed to walk out of an open door and through three unlocked gates because staff thought he was being picked up by his mother Kylie at the end of the day.

But when she arrived and he was nowhere to be seen, teachers at Ramsden Infant and Nursery School in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria pleaded with her to phone 999, insisting they could find him by themselves.

Ms Quest ignored them and asked officers to search for her son, who was found safe 45 minutes later.

Plea: Mother Kylie Quest was asked by teachers not to call the police when her son Alfie went missing

'When I arrived at the school gates to collect Alfie the teachers looked shocked to see me,' the 25-year-old mother said.

'They said he had gone and thought I had already picked him up. They started looking under desks and chairs, and when I said I was going to call the police they asked me not to.

'They were just covering their own backs. I called the police straight away anyway, and officers scoured the area and finally found him.'

Alfie crossed a busy road and walked for nearly half a mile to try and buy a toy alien that he wanted.

Ms Quest said school workers told her 'we will find him' and urged her not to get the authorities involved.

Safe: The young boy was found after about 45 minutes and has now left the school

'I ignored them and phoned the police anyway,' she said. 'It was the right thing to do.

'Anything could have happened to Alfie. I was beside myself. I kept thinking, what if a paedophile had snatched him?

'It was terrifying. The relief was overwhelming when we found him. I started crying, and then he started crying because I was.

'I have told him he must never wander out of school again, but because of his learning difficulties it is hard for him to understand.

'He was trying to buy a toy alien. He had been asking me for one for a while.'

Headteacher Nicky Brewerton insisted that she did not behave inappropriately, saying: 'All I know is that somebody told me mum is ringing the police, and I said "good" because somebody should.'

She added that she would launch an internal investigation into the incident.

Ms Quest says she will report the school to Ofsted, and Alfie has now started at a different school.

Police confirmed that they had been called to the school to help look for the five-year-old, and found him after around 35 minutes.
