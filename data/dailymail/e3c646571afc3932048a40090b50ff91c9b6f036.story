Survivors of the Philippines typhoon have been ‘let down’ by a slow aid response, the UN’s humanitarian chief said yesterday.

Baroness Amos said that despite relief pouring in from around the world, it is still not reaching many of those in need a week after Haiyan struck.  

Britain yesterday sent the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious to help the victims, as anger grows in areas where life-saving aid has yet to arrive.

Lady Amos, the former UK International Development Secretary, added: ‘I do feel we have let people down. We need to get assistance to them now.

Thousands of people trapped in the devastated city of Tacloban are in desperate need of food and water six days after Super Typhoon Haiyan struck

Valerie Amos, the UN humanitarian aid chief, said relief to the worst affected areas has been far too slow

‘They are already saying it has taken too long to arrive. Ensuring a faster delivery is our immediate priority.’ She added: ‘I very much hope that in the next 48 hours, that will change significantly.

'It’s true, there are still areas that we have not been able to get to where people are in desperate need.’

The death toll originally put at 10,000 around the city of Tacloban alone was yesterday dramatically reduced to 4,460, although this is still expected to rise.

With the stench from rotting  bodies overwhelming and little shelter among the devastation, frustration has been boiling over as essential supplies fail to reach many of those in need in the city, where food and other goods have stacked up at the airport.

Just five miles away, thousands have found shelter among the squalor of a convention centre but say they have not seen any relief workers.

Tacloban's Mayor Romualdez said he is desperate to move the bodies from the streets because they are 'creating an atmosphere of fear and depression'

The city of Tacloban has a dire shortage of heavy equipment such as lorries which are needed to move bodies and deliver food

The bodies were piled on top of one another in deep pits as fire crews and authorities desperately try to clear the streets of people killed by the typhoon

Amid deeply harrowing scenes, 300 bodies were buried in a mass grave yesterday on the outskirts of Tacloban while a larger one capable of holding 1,000 is under construction.

‘There are still bodies on the road,’ said Alfred Romualdez, mayor of Tacloban, a city of 220,000 people reduced to rubble in worst-hit Leyte province.

‘It’s scary. There is a request from a community to come and collect  bodies. They say it’s five or ten. When we get there, it’s 40.’

Some areas appear to be teetering on anarchy amid the widespread looting of shops and warehouses for food and water. In some spots,  Philippine soldiers on trucks distributed rice and water as chainsaw-wielding teams cut debris from blocked roads.

Thousands more swarmed Tacloban’s damaged airport, desperate to leave or to get treatment at a makeshift health centre.

Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres described a bleak situation in Guiuan where 45,000 live.

Worker Alex Moens said: ‘People are living out in the open.  The needs are immense and there are a lot of surrounding villages that are not yet covered by any aid organisations.’

Survivors of the devastating typhoon are having to cope with barely any supplies and men as young as this one have to pitch in moving bodies

Authorities in Tacloban said they urgently need logistical support because they cannot move bodies and the deliver food in the same trucks

About 2,000 bodies have been collected so far in Tacloban but authorities say there are many more, although the original feared death toll of 10,000 is now believed to be too high

Many bodies of people killed by Typhoon Haiyan are still unrecovered with more corpses lying in the streets

Volunteer Corazon Cecleno added: ‘What can we do? There’s nothing we can do! We really want to know why the distribution of help is  so slow.’

The Illustrious, with 900 crew aboard and seven helicopters, was sent to the region from the Gulf  yesterday as Britain announced it had increased the amount of help given to £20million.

The operation will be one of the last for the carrier – Britain’s oldest warship – which is due to be decommissioned next year.

HMS Illustrious is being sent to the Philippines to provide practical support

Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious is being sent to the Philippines to help victims of Typhoon Haiyan, David Cameron has announced.

Speaking during a visit to India, the Prime Minister said that the ship will replace HMS Daring, which has already been deployed to the Philippines.

Its helicopters may be used to assist with the distribution of food and water to survivors stranded in remote locations in the far eastern archipelago state, and its facilities to make water drinkable are likely to be in demand in a country where supplies have been badly disrupted by the typhoon.

The Ministry of Defence said that Illustrious, which has been taking part in war-game operations, should arrive in the Philippines on November 24 or 25, with 900 crew and seven helicopters on board.

Mr Cameron said: 'What happened in the Philippines is an absolute tragedy. You can see the devastation, the suffering, and it's quite clear that we are going to need long-term help for those people.

'As ever, the British people have been very generous with their donations.

'The British Government has already pledged over £20million, which makes us one of the most generous donors anywhere in the world.

'But it's practical action that's needed as well. That's why I sent HMS Daring to go and help in the Philippines and I can announce today that once Daring has started its work, we are actually going to be able to replace in time HMS Daring with HMS Illustrious, which is, of course, a carrier with helicopters - seven times as many helicopters as on HMS Daring and with the key ability to process fresh water, so we will be giving further assistance in the best way we can.'

The MoD was unable to confirm the current location of Illustrious but the Royal Navy reported the warship was in Muscat, Oman, on November 12.

HMS Illustrious, Britain's sole remaining aircraft carrier, will retire from active duty next year.
