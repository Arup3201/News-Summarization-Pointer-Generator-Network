Party animals with very deep pockets can celebrate the new year twice by travelling by private jet to two country's midnight festivities.

A private jet company are offering the ultimate party for New Year's Eve which will allow passengers to celebrate midnight Australia and again in the USA.

Party goers will start their evening in Sydney at 8pm and will see in the New Year until 1am on January 1st.

Revellers will party in Sydney Australia, and then board a private jet which will fly 13 hours to Los Angeles, US

They will then board a private jet which will fly 13 hours to Los Angeles, landing at 8pm on New Year's Eve, due to the time difference.

The Gulfstream G550 jet has space for 15 people to continue the party with an on board entertainment system, and fully stocked bar.

For those who wish to recharge their batteries, there are ensuite cabins and reclining chairs on board.

The party-goers will attend an exclusive bash at the Sydney Opera House, before catching their flight to the US to celebrate all over again

For those that want to relax inbetween parties, there are luxury cabins on the plane

The double party experience costs £137,355 or just over £9,000 based upon 15 people sharing.

Carol
 Cork, marketing director of PrivateFly.com, said: 'This is the ultimate
 way to see in 2014, in two of the world's most exciting party cities.

Los Angeles is 19 hours behind Sydney - just over 13 hours away in a 
long range private jet.

'So
 you can gain six hours of party time by flying eastwards.

This is only 
possible by private jet, as the timings are so tight - and there are no 
airline schedules to fit the itinerary.

'Supersonic private jets are currently at concept stage, and expected to be in operation by 2021.

So watch this space for even more exciting, multiple New Year itineraries coming in the next few years.'

She added: 'While other partygoers are waking to a New Year and sore heads back in Sydney, the night is still young in LA.

You'll land - refreshed and ready to start all over again - at Van Nuys, LA's exclusive private jet airport.'
