Pop icon Kate Bush has been criticised for a comeback poster of herself being rescued from the sea which was released as the search continues for missing flight MH370.

The 55-year-old singer wears a lifejacket in choppy waters in the image, released yesterday for the long-awaited announcement of her first live gigs for 35 years.

But the the timing of the poster's release led some to claim it was inappropriate - for which the singer apologised today.

'The timing is really unfortunate,' she said. 'There 
is absolutely no connection with the current tragedy that is heading the
 news and I apologise from the bottom of my heart if this has in any way
 upset or at all offended anyone.'

Inappropriate? Fans on Twitter questioned the timing of this photo released to promote Kate Bush

Questions: Twitter users began to ask about the photo and its unfortunate timing with the search for MH370

Am I the only one? Twitter user @KrisDeSouza questioned whether the shot was 'a little inappropriate'

Missing: The last known image of the Boeing 777 Malaysia Airlines jet, which is still missing after two weeks

Apology: The singer explained the origin of the photo today on her website, saying it represented the narrative of her 1985 conceptual piece The Ninth Wave in which a woman is lost at sea

In the statement on her website, she added: 'I am rather concerned at some comments that have been passed on to me and I 
feel I should clarify my position.

'The image that was chosen to 
advertise the shows originates from a conceptual piece called The Ninth 
Wave that was released in 1985.

'It is about a woman who is lost at sea 
but is rescued in the end. Months ago I thought that, as part of the 
show centres around this musical piece,  it would hopefully make a 
dramatic shot.' 

Bush's publicist confirmed the photo was taken before the jet disappeared.

The photo sparked debate on Twitter before the statement, where one user wrote: 'She must have shot this pre-publicity photo before the Malaysian Airlines jet went missing, right?'

Another said: 'Am I the only one who thinks that given the missing Malaysian plane, Kate Bush posing in a life jacket at sea is a little inappropriate?'

One Twitter user condemned it as 'poor timing' which should have been picked up while another suggested it might be 'genius marketing' and a 'conspiracy'.

Others defended Bush, who famously avoids the public eye and has not played live since 1979.

One fan said the criticism was an 'absurd comment', another simply wrote 'for f***'s sake' and one rightly speculated that the photo was a hint Bush would play her 1985 seven-track concept piece The Ninth Wave.

Disagreement: Several users questioned the logic of the photo - though one said criticism was 'absurd'. Another thought the photo could be a hint she would perform seven-track concept piece The Ninth Wave

Individual style: Kate Bush at the height of her fame, left, and when she was made a CBE by the Queen last year

Argument: One joked that it was genius marketing and a conspiracy. Another just said: 'For f***'s sake'

The singer will play a 15-night residency with the title Before the Dawn at London's Hammersmith Apollo in August and September.

The venue was not chosen randomly - then known as the Hammersmith Odeon, it was the scene of her last gig on 14 May 1979.

Tickets will go on sale next Friday at 9.30am for the dates and booking lines are expected to be indundated.

If punters buy the maximum allocation of four tickets each, there will be fewer than 14,000 sets available for one of the most venerated British acts of the last 40 years.

Kate Bush soared to fame in 1979 with her single Wuthering Heights, which she wrote when she was just 18.

The song based on Emily Brontë's dark love story of the same name was followed by hits including Babooshka and Running Up That Hill.

Shy of publicity, she became respected for her uncompromising individualism and refusal to make pop music in anything other than her own style.

On her website the singer added: 'I
 was working all day yesterday and so was totally unaware of the 
reaction, apart from friends who'd told me it had all gone bonkers.

'I 
am completely overwhelmed and genuinely shocked by the incredibly 
positive response from everyone. Thank you!'

The fate of flight MH370, meanwhile, remains a mystery two weeks after it vanished between Malaysia and Vietnam with 239 passengers on board.

Despite dozens of theories circulating about its disappearance, there is still confusion over what happened to the jet.

Today Chinese authorities said they had spotted 'suspicious' object measuring 72ft by 42ft and floating in the remote search zone of the Indian Ocean.
