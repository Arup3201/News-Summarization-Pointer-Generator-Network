The £16,000-a-night penthouse suite and the infinity pool just above it aren’t quite ready, but Room 4803 on the 48th floor is open for business.

It’s perfect for anyone looking to go up in the world. But not recommended if you’re scared of heights.

This is the highest hotel room in Western Europe and I’m the first to sleep in it. Called the Shangri-La it’s finally opened in The Shard next to the Thames in central London, almost a year behind schedule and still a work in progress. And it’s sensational in more ways than the Qatari owners might have wanted.

Each of the hotel's stunning rooms comes with binoculars so guests can make the most of spectacular views. However, as Mark Palmer discovered, visitors can often see straight into neighbouring rooms because of a design fault

A pair of binoculars sits on the desk but the view hardly needs any amplification. Tower Bridge, to the east, looks like it belongs in a toy-town miniature village, while St Paul’s Cathedral just about holds its own to the west, with the river snaking through the capital, passing the Houses of Parliament, Battersea Power Station, Richmond Park and beyond.

But what’s this just below me? It can’t be a naked buttock rising from a free-standing bath tub on the 47th floor? It certainly is.

The corners of the building have a square chunk taken out so neighbouring windows face each other at right-angles. Look diagonally across and you can see straight in.

You can also see the floor below, hence my close encounter with the buttock in question.

I dare say people in the room next to mine across the gap, with their identical floor to ceiling windows, may have had the unsettling experience of seeing me wandering around in my birthday suit, too. 

Guests at the hotel may enjoy a soak in the bath while watching over the bustling city below. Mark Palmer even spotted one visitor enjoying a soak a few floors below during his stay

There is a solution, but it defeats the whole purpose of spending anything from £500 a night for a berth in The Shard, which has 72 ‘habitable’ floors. Press a button and the electrically operated blinds come down — obliterating the much-vaunted ‘iconic’ views that you’ve spent a fortune to see.

You might as well be in the local Premier Inn, albeit one with heated lavatory seats, marble flooring, Acqua di Parma soaps and a minibar selling mixed nuts for £7 a jar.

All in all this dramatic design issue is highly embarrassing —unless you’re a Peeping Tom or in the British Naturism society, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. And it’s hardly something that the Shangri-La can dismiss as teething troubles.

‘We are familiar with some flaws and will deal with those as we go along,’ says the hotel’s genial general manager, Darren Gearing.

For now, he says, it’s a case of ‘orientating guests properly’ so they are aware of being spotted from below, above or to the side of their rooms.

David Warrilow, a businessman from 
Surrey, who has booked in for a five-star stay with his wife Gaynor to 
celebrate her 60th birthday, thinks it is ‘plain daft’ and likens the 
whole experience to the opening of Terminal Five at Heathrow Airport 
when everything was built but not everything worked.

He
 has a point. My towel rail has a notice above it saying ‘very hot’ but 
is stone cold; at breakfast my orange juice arrives after the coffee, 
and the toast turns up as I am about to leave. The hotel directory urges
 me to ‘enjoy a signature cocktail’ in Gong — the bar on the 52nd floor —
 there’s no earthly chance of doing so because it is still under 
construction.

But let’s not get too steamed up. This is a triumph in so many wondrous ways and it’s no surprise the reservations desk is busy.

Graham and Nicola Hall, from St Albans, booked as soon as the hotline opened two months ago. They went for a special ‘Romance in the Clouds’ package, which includes a three-course dinner, bed and breakfast, a bottle of champagne and two massages. The cost? £850.

‘It’s been well worth it,’ says Graham, a 49-year old farmer and builder. ‘Life’s too short. Live for today. We’re going to come again when the pool is ready.’

The 11m x 4m pool is due to open in July. The Gong bar will be next to the pool on the same floor and is likely to become one of the most exclusive bars in the world.

Eventually, there’ll be 202 rooms (59 are ready so far) and suites. Mine is on the Canary Wharf side, looking down on the Tower of London on the other side of the river.

In my room is a leather-bound copy of James Hilton’s 1933 novel, Lost Horizon. It’s the story of a community in the mountains  of Tibet, best remembered as the origin of Shangri-La, a fictional utopia.

I dare say The Shard’s celebrated architect, Renzo Piano, read it before embarking on the £90 million project. It can’t have been his idea to put the baths by the windows in full view of other guests. Though it does add a certain frisson, an element of danger.

‘It’s a house of mirrors,’ says fellow guest Ray Anderson, 56, who lives in Cambridge.

He’s here celebrating his birthday with his wife and is already planning to return in December.

‘I’ve stayed in tall buildings all over the world but this is the best of the lot — even better than the Grand Hyatt in Tokyo. It has surpassed my expectations. I love the silence in our room, then you open the blinds and all of life is out there but you still don’t hear a word.’

But he has a word of caution.

‘You just have to remember to turn the lights off at night to avoid being spied on.’

Room rates at the Shangri-La (0207 234 8088, shangri-la.com/london) start at £450 per night. The ‘Room With A View’ package is from £530 per night, based on two adults sharing, B&B and two tickets to The View from The Shard.
