National Security Adviser Susan Rice defended the Obama White House's Taliban prisoner exchange on Sunday morning, telling CNN and ABC audiences that releasing five high-level terror targets to the nation of Qatar in exchange for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl won't put American national security at risk.

'We felt that as the war is winding 
down, it was our sacred obligation, given the opportunity to get him 
back, that we do so,' Rice told CNN's Candy Crowley on the 'State of the Union' program.

'We did so in a way that 
resulted in the Taliban prisoners being monitored and kept in a secure 
way in Qatar.'

And addressing the thorny question of whether negotiating with terrorists might lead to more kidnappers' demands for more detainee releases from Guantanamo Bay, Rice insisted that the military detention center is still slated for closure.

'The terrorists are intent on doing what they want to do,' she said, 'But Candy, we have a commitment to close Guantanamo Bay. The president's been very clear about that.'

'The existence of Guantanamo Bay is itself a detriment to our national security, which is why the president has prioritized closing it, and why we intend to get that done.'

Gitmo is still slated for closure, Susan Rice insisted on Sunday, saying that mothballing the military detention center would remove the incentive for terror groups to demand hostage exchanges

Obama has been accused of violating U.S. laws by approving a prisoner exchange of five Guantanamo detainees for the release of America's only prisoner of war. The five Afghans are among the most senior members of the Taliban being held at the controversial camp, and include one who had direct ties to Osama bin Laden

Obama wasn't required to notify Congress before letting five Taliban fighters out of Guantanamo Bay, Rice said, because Sgt. Bergdahl's reportedly deteriorating health gave the president an emergency exception to a law he signed a year ago -- but Obama has written in the past that the notification requirement itself was unconstitutional

Rice also said President Barack Obama had spoken personally with Qatari Amir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani on Tuesday 'when this looked like it was a real possibility.'

The amir, she said, promised Obama 'directly and personally' that there would be restrictions on the five released Taliban fighters – 'that these prisoners will be carefully watched, that their ability to move will be constrained.'

'We believe that this is in the national security interest of the United States,'she said.

The only condition of their release that has been made public is a promise that they will not be permitted to leave Qatar for one year.

'Are they free to be in the country, free to communicate with whoever they want?' Crowley asked, 'or are they in detention in Qatar?'

Rice pledged that 'there are restrictions on their movement and behavior. I'm not at liberty to get into detail about the precise nature of those restrictions.'

'But suffice it to say that we are satisfied,' she added, 'that that substantially mitigates the risk to the United States and to our national security and we feel confident that the assurances given to us will be upheld.'

Rice's choice of words – 'substantially mitigates' – will be a crucial element in the Obama administration's defense of its decision.

On ABC's 'This Week' program, host George Stephanopoulos cited a federal law that 'requires assurances that they're not going to be able to return to the battlefield' and harm American interests.

Rice leapt in to correct him.

'The law says that we need to have sufficient confidence that the risk can be substantially mitigated,' she protested.

'And we do have ... that confidence based on a detailed understanding with the government of Qatar based on President Obama's personal communication with the emir of Qatar on Tuesday.'

Rice also dismissed public concerns about the nature of Bergdahl's 2009 disappearance from his U.S. Army unit.

President Barack Obama joined Jani and Bob Bergdahl, the parents of U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, in the Rose Garden of the White House on Saturday to announce that their son had been released to U.S. Special Forces after five years in captivity

Rice dismissed concerns about how Bergdahl came to be captured five years ago, saying that 'the point is that he is back'

Sgt. Bergdahl's capture was first announced to the world in a July 2009 video in which one of his captors displayed his dog tags

'There are a lot of questions about how he originally was captured and whether or not he had deserted, had left his post,' said Stephanopoulos. 'Is that going to be investigated? And if it's found that he did indeed leave his post, will he be disciplined – or has he already paid the price?'

Rice downplayed concerns about any part Bergdahl may have played in his own capture.

'Certainly anybody who has been held in those conditions, in captivity, for five years has paid an extraordinary price. But that is really not the point,' she replied. 'The point is that he is back.'

Some Republicans in Congress are complaining that Obama broke a federal law that he himself signed in 2013, by failing to notify lawmakers before transferring anyone out of the island detention center.

The law also requires Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to explain why prisoners are being released, and to assure Congress that the freed terror suspects won't be able to reengage in any activities that might harm the U.S. or its global interests.

The Washington Post reported Saturday night that Obama added a 'signing statement' when he inked the bill into law, 'contending that the notification requirement was an unconstitutional infringement on his powers as commander-in-chief and that he therefore could override it.'

Obama's national security adviser said Qatar's emir had given the White House 'sufficient assurances' that the released detainees won't be able to harm the United States or its interests

Bowe Bergdahl's release was celebrated in his hometown of Hailey, Idaho, but unconfirmed reports have circulated since Saturday describing a different Army sergeant -- one who deserted his post and went off in search of Taliban fighters to join, not to fight

While campaigning for president in 2008, Obama habitually excoriated President George W. Bush for issuing signing statements, calling them an unconstitutional "end-run' around Congress.

“Congress’ job is to pass legislation,' then-Senator Obama explained during a May 19, 2008 campaign stop in Billings, Montana. 'The president can veto it or he can sign it. But what George Bush has been trying to do as part of his effort to accumulate more power in the presidency.'

'He’s been saying, "Well, I can basically change what Congress passed by attaching a letter saying I don’t agree with this part or I don’t agree with that part, [and] I’m going to choose to interpret it this way or that way." That's not part of his power, but this is part of the whole theory of George Bush that he can make laws as he goes along.'

Susan Rice has been an infrequent guest on Sunday morning political talk shows since September 2012 when she told five separate audiences on a single Sunday that a terror attack on U.S. diplomatic facilities in Benghazi, Libya was the result of an anti-Muslim YouTube video.

That explanation was later debunked, and evidence shows that the Obama administration knew almost immediately that an al-Qaeda-linked terror group called Ansar al-Shariah had launched a premeditated attack.

Four Americans, including the U.S. Ambassador to Libya, died in the military-style assault. But Obama was weeks away from re-election, and insisting that his foreign policy had taken al-Qaeda off the battlefield.

Obama's national security adviser told CNN that the president pulled the trigger on a hostage exchange after Qatar's emir promised that the five Taliban the US released would not be able to reenter the terror battlefield

She also rearticulated Obama's pledge to close the Guantanamo Bay detention center, saying its existence attracts kidnappers who want a bargaining chip to free their comrades

@highlight

Rice refused to discuss the circumstances of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl's capture, and didn't address reports that he was AWOL and looking to join the Taliban

@highlight

She was careful to use talking-point language on ABC, saying that Obama was only required to determine that Qatar's promises about the Taliban fighters' restrictions 'substantially mitigates' the risk to the US
