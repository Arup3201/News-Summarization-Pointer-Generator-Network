Tom Huddlestone believes the Tottenham Hotspur revolution on Humberside will help Hull City cement their place as a Premier League club.

Michael Dawson became the third player to swap White Hart Lane for the KC Stadium this week when he joined in a £3.5 million deal.

That trio — Dawson, Huddlestone and Jake Livermore — have all been capped by England and cost the Tigers a combined £15m.

Hot Spurs: Tom Huddlestone (L) is pleased that another Tottenham player has arrived at the KC Stadium

Dawson will make his debut at Aston Villa today, and Huddlestone said: ‘Daws brings leadership, he’s very good on the ball. Defensively he is very clever and obviously he’s not been at Tottenham for 10 years for no reason.

‘I was surprised Spurs let him go to be honest, because even last season he played near enough every game for them. It was a bit of a surprise because he’s only 30 so hopefully we can get three or four good years from him.

‘Spurs’ loss is our gain. They’ve obviously got a new manager [Mauricio Pochettino] who is trying to do things his own way and wants his own players which is fair enough, but hopefully we can benefit from that with the signing of Daws.’

Incoming: Uruguay striker Abel Hernandez is expected to arrive from Palermo

The midfielder — a £5.25m arrival last summer — added: ‘I saw potential in the squad last year which made me sign and we had a good season, which is attracting players like Dawson and Abel Hernandez [the Uruguay striker on the verge of a £10m move from Palermo].

‘The season we had last year is helping bring quality players like that and long may it continue. We’ve made a statement with these signings.’

Hull are in their second season in the top flight under the canny guidance of Steve Bruce. They were FA Cup finalists in May but failed to progress to the Europa League group stage after exiting on away goals to Belgian side Sporting Lokeren on Thursday.

‘The lads are devastated,’ Huddlestone admitted. ‘We obviously won the game but away goals are cruel. Seeing the Europa League draw was when it fully sunk in.

‘But we need to be straight back on it. As devastating as Thursday night was, having a game two or three days later is the perfect way to bounce back and get it out of your system.’
