Heroic: Aaron Edson, 37, rushed to the rescue of his five-year-old stepdaughter in Sandy, Utah, in the early hours of yesterday morning

This is the heroic step-father who rescued his five-year-old daughter from the clutches of a brazen kidnapper who snatched her from her own bed in the middle of the night.

Aaron Edson, 37, awoke to find Troy Morley, 46, carrying his daughter across his front lawn at 4:30 yesterday morning in quiet Sandy, Utah, police say.

'What are you doing, that’s my daughter, you’re not taking her!' the father screamed.

Morley, who is 5-foot-11 and 250lbs, put the girl down without struggle.

He fled and was eventually caught in another house after a police dog subdued him.

On Friday night, the 911 call made by the girl's mother was released by KSL.com.

In the footage, Edson's wife, Stephanie, can be heard telling the dispatcher: 'There was a man in my home and he took my five-year-old daughter.

'And I happened to wake up and he had my daughter outside, and my husband ran out there and got him. But he took my five-year-old daughter.' 

The family say that they've never seen Morley before and they have no idea what he planned to do with the little girl if he had escaped with her.

Edson's identity was revealed yesterday when a family spokesman praised his quick action and said the family were seconds from losing the daughter.

Miles Holman, a local attorney, told MailOnline: 'Fifteen seconds later, the guy would have been 50 yards outside the house, he would have been gone.'

'I've been calling it a miracle. Nobody around Sandy expects anything like this - it is a quiet, middle-class neighborhood, not a dangerous place to live'.

He also said that the family is now fine, despite their 'very traumatic day'.

The nightmare incident evoked the 2002 abduction of 14-year-old Elizabeth Smart, snatched from her bedroom in Salt Lake City.

She was held captive for nine months by Mormon street preacher Brian David Mitchell before she was found and rescued.

Home safe and sound: The five-year-old victim of an attempted kidnapping rests safely with her mother after a home intruder snatched her out of her bed Friday morning

Troy Morley, 46, is seen here being led in the jail after he was released from the hospital Friday afternoon. He was bitten on the shoulder by a police dog before his arrest

Police say Morley had been wandering through the neighborhood trying to find open doors and windows to break into a home. He entered the house through an unlocked side door

The suspect in this case entered the home through an unlocked side door in the middle-class suburb south of Salt Lake City, Police Sergeant Dean Carriger said.

He was in the family's basement rummaging through their belongings  when he came upon the girl sleeping in her bedroom, Carriger said.

The suspect took her out of bed and carried her upstairs. The father told police that he awoke to the sound of creaking stairs and the front door being unlocked and opened. 

Neighbors told the Deseret News that they heard the girl screaming 'No! No! No!' as Morley tried to carry her away.  

After Morley fled, officers set up a perimeter, and with the help of police dogs, launched a search. The suspect went into a second home, where the residents heard him and called police.

Police captured Morley, shirtless, outside that second home thanks to a police dog that bit the suspect in the upper shoulder, Carriger said.

Police don't know yet why the suspect was in the house, whether he knew the girl was there when he broke in or if he had a planned to take her, Carriger said. 

Morley's last known address was in Roy, Utah, 45 miles north of Sandy. He has two two drunk driving arrests from 2009 and 2011 but no other significant Utah criminal history, the Deseret News reports.

He has been through two divorces in the last four years - once in 2010 and the second was finalized just last month after he filed for divorce in June.

Troy Morley allegedly broke into this house in quiet Sandy, Utah, by slipping in through an unlocked window. Once inside, he found a 5-year-old girl, whom he tried to abduct, police say

Morley was taken to hospital to be treated for dog bites, and has now been booked into the Salt Lake County jail for  investigation of child kidnapping, burglary, trespassing, interfering with an arrest and failing to stop at the command of a law enforcement officer.

Carriger said the family is doing pretty well considering what happened. They have declined to speak to reporters.

'It obviously was a very scary, traumatic situation,' Carriger said. 'The sanctity of our home is huge and for somebody to enter that and grab your child, it's got to be one of the worst nightmares a parent could face. . . If those parents were not awakened to go out and investigate, he could have easily left undetected with the girl.'
