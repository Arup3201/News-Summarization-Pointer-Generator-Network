While the woman was giving evidence during a criminal court case, her colleagues took her mobile from her coat pocket and sent nude photographs they found on the device to other friends in the force.

They then allegedly taunted the 42-year-old victim by sending her pictures of themselves in provocative poses.

The embarrassing affair has emerged after two of the sacked police community support officers took legal action, claiming unfair dismissal and arguing they were just enjoying ‘a bit of banter’.

'Misconduct': Former PCSOs Khalid Akhtar (left) and Joy Shoker arrive at an employment tribunal in Birmingham today, to appeal against being sacked

However, Khalid Akhtar, 42, and Joy 
Shoker, 24, both from Wolverhampton, yesterday saw their appeal thrown 
out by an employment tribunal in Birmingham.

The officers, who have ten years of 
police experience between them, were sacked on August 23 last year 
following accusations of bullying and harassment. As part of the local 
Safer Travel police team, the PCSOs had appeared at Dudley Magistrates’ 
Court in May 2011 to give evidence during a criminal case.

It is claimed that while the female 
colleague, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was on the stand, 
other members of the team found her phone in a coat pocket in a witness 
room.

They allegedly took the phone, 
trawled through photographs and came across nude pictures of the woman, 
which they then shared with other officers.

Kicked out: The PCSOs were fired from the West Midlands force after the woman claimed they took her phone while she gave evidence in a case at court

They are said to have followed this 
up by bombarding her with their own lewd pictures, mocking her by making
 provocative gestures at the camera.

The woman reported what had happened 
to her superiors and an internal police inquiry was launched. A number 
of officers had their phones seized and inspected by investigators. Four
 PCSOs were dismissed for gross misconduct, but one was reinstated after
 an appeal.

A fifth PCSO was also suspended but later resigned.

Speaking after the hearing, Akhtar, 
who had worked for the force for six years, said his life had been left 
in ‘tatters’ since he was dismissed. He said: ‘I have been fighting this
 every step of the way. I just want justice for myself.

‘I’m devastated. I’ve lost my job and people look down on me because of what they think I have done. I loved my job.

‘She [the victim] was actually one of my best friends.

‘She thought the pictures were making fun of her, but they weren’t.’

Shoker, who worked for  the force for four years, has since secured a job as an administrator.

She said: ‘The whole thing has been 
blown out of proportion. It was some text messages between a group of 
friends. A bit of banter is all.’

Employment tribunal judge Laurie Anstis rejected the claim of unfair dismissal because it was lodged too late.

Chris Rowson, head of human resources
 at the West Midlands force, said: ‘West Midlands Police expects the 
highest standards of professional behaviour from all of its employees 
and will thoroughly investigate allegations suggesting that any employee
 falls short of these expectations.’
