More than 11,000 rape kits that were left in police storage, some for 20 years, are to finally be tested after a $4 million grant from the attorney-general.

The discovery of the kits gathering dust in a Detroit warehouse in 2009 has shocked prosecutors, who have pushed for the evidence to be processed and the rapists to be brought to justice.

On Wednesday Michigan Governor Rick 
Snyder and attorney-general Bill Schuette announced that $4 million in 
settlement funds will be used to examine the kits.

'There are people who have been victims that are in these kits that deserve justice,' Mr Snyder said.

The discovery of the rape kits prompted Michigan prosecutor Kym 
Worthy to campaign for the DNA evidence to be processed and the rapists brought to justice.

'What we were potentially looking at, at
that time, was over 10,000 rape kits, representing over 10,000 cases 
where women had reported, whose lives and what happened to them was 
sitting on a shelf and nobody cared,' she told Rock Center in February.

'I was shocked, and I think I was 
kind of stunned – and not too much stuns me.'

In 2009 Mrs Worthy's assistant prosecutor Rob Spada discovered the kits as he was given a tour of a Detroit police storage warehouse while helping them to organize their records.

'I saw numerous
racks with cardboard boxes, and they told me at that point those were 
rape kits. I immediately asked the representatives, were they tested rape
kits or untested rape kits. And at that point they said, "We don’t 
know",' he said.

Campaign: Prosecutor Kym Worthy and her staff volunteered their time to work through the backlog

The rape kits are about half the size of a small pizza box. They contain documentation, supplies for technicians, swabs and other items to collect samples, according to CBS Detroit.

The Detroit Crime Commission has 
supported the campaign to have the kits tested. It will cost between $1,200 and $1,500 to have each one processed.

However, of the 569 tested so far, 136 have matched results in the FBI's combined DNA index system. And 32 of those matches were for serial rapists, Mrs Worthy told NBC News.

'To know that we had all of these 
potential victims sitting out there, all of them, mostly women, and 
nothing had been done, was just truly appalling,' she said.

One of the women whose evidence was left in the warehouse was a mother, who was raped by an unknown intruder at her Detroit home in 1997 as her children slept in the bed next to her.

Fourteen years after she came forward to give evidence and a statement, the victim told Rock Center she was shocked to receive a knock on the door to say her case was now being investigated.

After Mr Spada discovered the forgotten kits, Prosecutor Worthy's staff volunteered their time to help sort through the records and try to build cases.

Prosecutor Worthy, who was the victim of a sexual assault in law school, said she also discovered that forgotten rape kits were not just a problem in Detroit.

At the time, Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and many other major cities faced the same backlog.

The campaign group End the Backlog, estimates tens of thousand of kits remain untested across the U.S. adding that a lack of time and technology had added to the problem.

Mr Snyder backed the prosecutor's campaign, adding: 'It's right for our criminal justice system because there are 
bad people out there who should be put away. This will 
allow us to do that.'

Mr Schuette added: 'Twice women were violated, once by the rape and second by the justice was put in a box; put on a shelf. That’s going to end now.'

'Today marks the beginning of healing closure and justice for women who’ve been brutalized.'

Prosecutor Worthy's office will now begin building cases around the old evidence.

The single mother of three daughters said: 'We have a commitment to processing any case we can.'
