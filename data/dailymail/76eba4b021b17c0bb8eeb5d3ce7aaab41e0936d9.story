A man has accused Delta Airlines of losing his dog at LAX Airport.

Frank Romano was told to hand his bull terrier Ty to a flight attendant as he boarded a plane from Los Angeles, California, to Tampa, Florida, on Friday night.

But an hour later, he was in his seat when a flight attendant informed him Ty had chewed his way through the metal door of his portable plastic kennel and fled.

The airline official later said they had in fact misplaced the kennel.

'It’s been very depressing. Very upsetting. I’ve been crying. I’ve been angry,' Romano told CBS.

'She said your dog bit through the kennel. And we need you to just identify the dog. And then she changed her story that they couldn’t find my dog. And that the dog had been lost for an hour.'

'I don't know how he could've bit through his kennel...it had a metal door and was made of hard plastic,' Romano told LAist.com.

Romano adopted Ty last year while working at a pet store as a dog walker.

Delta has said in a statement: 'Delta continues to investigate what happened, but early indications show that procedures were followed, and the dog may have compromised the kennel on its own. 

'Delta immediately worked with LAX airport teams and the customer to locate the dog but was unsuccessful. 

'We remain in contact with this customer, and we are fully supporting the search for their pet. 

'Delta understands that pets are important members of the family and regrets this occurred while this pet was entrusted to our care.'
