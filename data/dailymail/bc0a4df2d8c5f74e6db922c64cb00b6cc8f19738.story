England finished their autumn series in memorable fashion as a powerful forward effort, guided by excellent control from the half-backs, secured a deserved 26-17 win. 

Attention will now turn to England's Six Nations opener against Wales at the Millennium Stadium in February as Stuart Lancaster's side look to build on this impressive display. 

Here, Sportsmail looks at five things England learned from the match. 

BACK TO BASICS IS BEST FOR ENGLAND 

After stuttering displays against New Zealand, South Africa and Samoa over the last few weeks, England produced their most fluid and organised performance of the autumn against Australia.

The build-up to both of Ben Morgan’s tries summed up England’s ruthless approach at Twickenham.

For Morgan’s first, England drove from the lineout with Brad Barritt running straight and hard to set up a strong platform at the ruck. Ben Youngs then released the onrushing Tom Wood who supplied the deftest of passes to Ben Morgan to barrel over.

Morgan powered over from close range for England’s second after the pack demolished the Wallabies at scrum time. It’s worth remembering, however, that the set-piece came about from Mike Brown’s intelligent kick and Jonny May’s superb chase that forced Quade Cooper to carry the ball into his own in-goal area.

Simple, efficient and direct rugby. That’s the way forward for England.

SKELTON CAN ADD STEEL TO WALLABIES PACK 

The Wallabies pack had a torrid day at Twickenham, but Will Sketon’s cameo will have pleased Michael Cheika.

Auckland-born Skelton tips the scales at 135kg and used England replacement lock George Kruis as a speed bump in the lead-up to his second-half try.

The 22-year-old developed under the watchful eye of Cheika at the New South Wales Waratahs and featured for the Sydney franchise against the British and Irish Lions in 2013.

Skelton exploded onto the international scene with a Man of the Match display on his Wallabies debut against France in June. The monster second row barrelled over French flanker Fulgence Ouedraogo to register his first try in that game before showing deft hands to release Israel Folau for another score to cap off a sensational debut. 

Skelton has played a more subtle role for the Wallabies on this tour, but there is no question that he is rising talent in the global game.

Amazingly, Skelton is not the biggest member of his family. His 19-year-old brother Cameron is 10kgs heavier and has recently taken up a lucrative offer with the Waikato Chiefs in New Zealand.

STUART STRIKES BIG PSYCHOLOGICAL BLOW 

Less than 10 months out from next year’s World Cup, Stuart Lancaster’s England side now have a serious mental edge over the wounded Wallabies.

Australia are a fabulous side to watch with Israel Folau, Henry Speight, Adam Ashley-Cooper and Bernard Foley running riot at Twickenham, but Australia’s deficiencies up front were once again exposed.

These two sides will look horns again in a crucial Pool A clash in London at next year’s World Cup. If the England pack can do this to Australia now. Imagine what they can do when they get Alex Corbisiero, Dan Cole, Tom Youngs, Geoff Parling and Joe Launchbury back from injury.

A shuddering thought for Cheika. The Wallabies coach has a serious repair job on his hands; both mentally and technically.

The England scrum will cause Michael Cheika many sleepless nights in the coming months 

ENGLAND BACKROW BITES BACK 

England’s backrow triumvirate of Wood, captain Chris Robshaw and Morgan have come in for heavy criticism in recent weeks.

The trio answered their critics with aplomb against the Wallabies. Wood showcased his superb aerial skills fielding several kick-offs while providing England with a superb option at the tail of the lineout. The Northampton flanker also showed up well in the loose. 

Robshaw was challenged by the England management during the week to have more of a presence at the breakdown and the Harlequins skipper delivered in spades. Robshaw made two crucial turnovers, contributed 14 tackles and outshone his opposite number Michael Hooper which is no mean feat.

Morgan has surely cemented his place for the Six Nations opener against Wales next February after this powerful display. The Gloucester number eight provided the attacking ballast that England have craved in this series and made 13 tackles to boot.

LAWES IS A LEADING LIGHT 

All Blacks lock Brodie Retallick has recently been named the world’s best player, but Courtney Lawes is not far behind him.

Lawes was everywhere for England once again at Twickenham. The Northampton Saints player has a staggering workrate and has become one of his country’s most important players.

Lawes demonstrated his athleticism with a crucial try-saving tackle on Ashley-Cooper early in the first half while he also showed incredible pace to chase down Folau after the break.

Lawes left the field in the 54th minute a spent force having made 12 tackles in less than an hour. He simply had no more left to give. A world-class talent.
