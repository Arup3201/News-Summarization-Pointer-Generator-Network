Scandinavian kings, queens, princes and princesses have all attended this year's Nobel Prize ceremonies - helping form a guest list that gave the annual event an injection of prestige and glamour not seen in recent years.

While the royals traditionally attend the ceremonies in Stockholm and Oslo, this year many opted to bring their powerful and wealthy partners in a guest list that threatened to overshadow the work of the award recipients themselves.

Among the guests to attend the ceremony in Stockholm were New York banker Christopher O'Neill, who last year married Swedish Princess Madeleine, and her brother Prince Carl Philip - who brought with him his fiance Sofia Hellqvist - a former reality TV star and lad mag pin-up girl.

Seated nearby on stage during the ceremony were their parents, the reigning King and Queen of Sweden, King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia, as well as their eldest child Crown Princess Victoria and her partner Prince Daniel.

After presenting the awards, King Carl, his family and their partners were seated at the 'honor table' for the traditional Nobel banquet.

Alongside the award recipients, they were treated to a three-course meal consisting of red king crab, red deer spiced loin, and a wild dewberry sorbet.

When the winners of the Nobel Prizes in literature and sciences received their prizes from King Carl  at the Stockholm Concert Hall, they did so against a backdrop of 20,000 flowers, prepared by 12 florists.

Following tradition, the flowers were coloured deep red, cerise and pink, and included roses, carnations and hortensias.

Each year the scientific and literature awards are presented in Stockholm, Sweden, while the Nobel Peace Prize is handed out in Oslo, Norway.

In nearby Oslo City Hall, Norwegian royalty were also in attendance to see Pakistani teenager Malala Yousafzai become the youngest ever Nobel Peace Prize recipient.

The 17-year-old was presented with her award at a star-studded ceremony also attended by Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler, Queen Latifah ahead of their performances at tonight's Nobel Peace Prize Concert. 

Malala became a household name after her campaigning for girls' right to education led to an assassination attempt by the Taliban two years ago, and has worked tirelessly as a human rights campaigner following her recovery.
