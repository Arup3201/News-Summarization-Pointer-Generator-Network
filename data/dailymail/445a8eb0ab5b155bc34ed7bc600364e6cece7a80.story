Michael Schumacher ‘will not be Schumacher’ if he wakes up from his coma, a leading neurosurgeon has claimed.

Doctors say the Formula One star is no longer in a 'critical' condition but Richard Greenwood, a consultant 
neurologist at London’s Homerton Hospital, said the racing legend will 
be a ‘regular Joe’ if he recovers, as a result of his severe brain 
trauma.

Schumacher has been in a medically 
induced coma for nearly three weeks after suffering significant brain 
injuries in a skiing accident at the French Alpine resort of Meribel.

No return: If Michael Schumacher recovers from his brain injury he will be 'and average Joe Bloggs,' a top neurosurgeon has said

Today, his 'lucky charm' bracelet was found buried in the snow by rescuers searching the crash site.

Superstitious Schumacher always wore the wooden bracelet - even while he was racing - and when he arrived in hospital without it rescuers volunteered to look, the Mirror reports.

The champion was admitted to the 
University of Grenoble hospital on December 29 after suffering 
significant brain injuries after striking a rock while skiing off-piste.

Dr Greenwood spoke at a conference looking into the long-term effects.

‘If Schumacher 
survives he will not be Schumacher. He will be Joe Bloggs,’ said 
Greenwood.

‘His rehabilitation will only be effective if he comes to terms with being Bloggs, and fulfils what Bloggs can do. That’s a very, very difficult process to take people through, and many people don’t achieve it.’

Fearing the worst: German media has been speculating that Michael Schumacher may never come out of his coma after speaking to experts about the progress of his condition following his skiing accident last month

Earlier this week, German media speculated that Schumacher may never wake from his current state.

'There
 may have been complications', said neurosurgeon Andreas Zieger of the 
University Clinic for neurosurgery in Oldenburg to Focus magazine.   

'We
 should not speculate here. Ultimately, we are talking about life and 
death. A coma can in theory be maintained for a lifetime. It won’t hurt 
the human brain.'

However, the claims have been refuted by his management team in the first official update on his condition in over a week.

‘Unfortunately,
 I have to repeat any information regarding Michael’s health not coming 
from the doctors treating him, or his management, must be treated as 
pure speculation,’ Schumacher’s manager Sabine Kehm said.

‘I
 also repeat Michael’s family is very happy and confident with the work 
of the team of doctors treating Michael, and they trust them completely.

‘Michael’s condition is still considered as stable.’
