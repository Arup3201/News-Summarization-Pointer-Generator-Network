A cardiologist is being sued by a New York City strip club for not paying over $135,000 - and says he  was drugged by the club's employees.

Dr. Zyad Kivarkis Younan, a cardiologist at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Jersey, has claimed that he did not authorize $135,303 worth of charges to his American Express card at Scores New York because, he claims, he was 'drugged' by an employee of the club and was incapable of approving the charges.

According to the lawsuit, Scores claims Younan 'contested the charges alleging that he was drugged by plaintiff’s employees and thus did not authorize the charges and/or he was not at plaintiff’s place of business on the aforesaid dates.'

The club, however, says it has Younan on video at the club four times over a 10-day period in November.

'Drugged': Dr. Zyad Younan, pictured, said he was drugged by employees at Scores New York and did not authorize over $135,000 charged to his credit card

In a lawsuit filed with Manhattan Supreme Court and obtained by the New York Daily News, the strip club says Younan came of his own accord during his four trips to the jiggle-joint in November.

It alleges Younan 'voluntarily came to plaintiff’s place of business and requested that plaintiff provide him with food, beverages and services.'

Club manager Stephen Hyman told the paper that it's not unusual for a person to run up a big bill at Scores. He says, however, that it is unusual when someone doesn't pay.

'We get a lot of very wealthy people here. You can run up a bill,' he said.

Just to get in the door at Scores will cost you $20. Bottles of champagne can sometimes cost more than $1,000. A meal at the club, the paper reports, will easily run you $250, and guests are allowed to leave tips for the dancers on their credit cards. 

'We charge reasonable — for us — prices for liquor. We don’t cater to beer drinkers,' Hyman said.

Plaintiff: Scores New York has filed a lawsuit against Younan for the money, and says he came 'voluntarily' to the club

As for Younan's claim that he was incapacitated when he was at the club, Hyman says, 'he was coherent until he saw the bill - or his wife saw the bill.'

Scores representative Steven Sabbeth told the NY Post 'This happens every once in a while, people get out of control with their credit cards, and then they wake up the next morning and realize what they’ve done.'

'They knew it the night before, but I guess it didn’t bother them because they were enjoying themselves.'
