He famously renounced his hereditary title so he could remain an MP.

But 50 years after Tony Benn relinquished the Viscountcy of Stansgate, his son has reclaimed the title so he can take a seat in the Lords.

The maverick socialist’s eldest son, Stephen, will become the latest of Labour’s ‘red princes’ to enter Parliament if he successfully contests a hereditary by-election next month.

Stephen Benn (right) has applied to reclaim the Viscountcy of Stansgate which his father Tony (left) gave up in the 1960s to continue his career as an MP. They are pictured with Stephen's daughter Emily in 2007. Tony Benn died in March this year

The 63-year-old former Labour party official, whose younger brother Hilary is shadow communities secretary in the Commons, is thought to be keen to take up a role on the opposition benches in the Upper House.

Tony Benn, who died aged 88 in March, fought to change the law so he could become the first peer to renounce his title.

After inheriting the title Viscount Stansgate on the death of his father in 1960, Mr Benn, who was already an MP, was disbarred from the House of Commons.

He successfully campaigned for the law to be amended, allowing him to renounce his title and retake his Bristol South East seat in 1963. At the time, he said: 'I am not a reluctant peer but a persistent commoner.'

His son Stephen, a lobbyist for the Society of Biology, who will now be known as the 3rd Viscount Stansgate, was today accepted on the Register of Hereditary Peers.

The majority of the hereditary peers are not allowed to sit in the Lords owing to the 1999 Act that capped their numbers.

But when one of the 90 to still retain a seat dies, the other peers of the deceased’s political party then vote for their new candidate in a by-election.

There are currently two vacancies following the death of Viscount Allenby of Megiddo and the retirement of Lord Cobbold last month.

Both peers were crossbenchers, so if Lord Benn stands in the by-election to replace them next month, he will be elected onto the crossbenches, but will then be able to move to Labour’s opposition bench.

Last month it emerged that not a single penny of Tony Benn’s £5m estate went to the Labour Party, the poor, or any radical causes he supported in his will.

Instead, Mr Benn, who throughout his political career was contemptuous of elitism and the privilege of inherited wealth, left almost his entire fortune to his four children.

His eight-bedroom ancestral home, understood to be worth millions, had been left in a trust for his family, which is thought to have avoided them having to pay inheritance tax on it.

While his brother Stephen Benn is currently seeking a route into the Lords, Hilary Benn has already carved out a long political career.

Now shadow communities secretary, he served in the Blair and Brown governments after being elected MP for Leeds Central in 1999 – a position he has held for 15 years.

Since being elected, he has also served as Secretary of State for International Development (from 2003 to 2007) and as the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (from 2007 to 2010).

However, Hilary is not the only Benn to have been a successful MP – his father Tony was an MP for nearly 50 years, serving in the Harold Wilson and James Callaghan Cabinets in the 1960s and 1970s.

Tony stood for Bristol South East between 1950 and 2001 but was forced to stand down when he inherited a hereditary peerage on his father William Wedgwood Benn’s death.

Air Commodore William was elected as a Liberal and Labour MP several times between 1906 and 1942 and was also Secretary of State for India (from 1929 to 1931) and Secretary of State for Air (from 1945 and 194).

In 1942, he was raised to the peerage as Viscount Stansgate, of Stansgate in Essex. At the time, the wartime coalition government was short of working Labour peers in the upper house.

Upon his death in November 1960, his son Tony inherited the peerage, becoming the 2nd Viscount Stansgate.

The peerage prevented him from continuing as MP for Bristol South East but he fought to remain in the House of Commons before campaigning for the ability to renounce the title. 

Tony was the first peer to make use of the Act, which was given Royal Assent in July 1963.  

As well as William, Tony and Hilary, the Benns have long been Members of Parliament.

Stephen and Hilary’s great-grandfather, Sir John Benn, was a Liberal MP from 1892-95 and 1904-10 and, another great-grandfather, Daniel Holmes, was a National Liberal MP from 1911-18.

Recently, Stephen’s 25-year-old daughter Emily became a Labour councillor in Croydon. She was elected to the West Thornton ward of Croydon Borough Council and is standing to become MP in Croydon South in 2015.

Born Anthony Wedgwood-Benn, Tony Benn became Britain's youngest MP when he was elected in 1950 aged 25.

His father William Wedgwood Benn had been raised to become the 1st Viscount of Stansgate under Churchill and become Secretary of State for Air under Clement Attlee.

When his older brother was killed on active service in World War II, Tony Benn became the heir to the viscountcy.

Lord Benn’s daughter Emily, 25, has already earned herself a mocking royal title – Red Princess – as she threatens to become the fifth generation of the family to enter Parliament.

She is standing for Labour in Croydon South next year.

Like her fellow youthful Labour parliamentary hopefuls the ‘Red Princes’ Stephen Kinnock, son of Neil, and Will Straw, son of former Home Secretary Jack, she is believed by some to have been able to launch her political career thanks to her ancestry, rather than her ability.

Already a Croydon councillor, and holding the record of being the youngest every parliamentary candidate when she was just 17, she denies any nepotism, but has boasted: ‘I was born during the Labour Party conference in 1989. My birth was announced to the floor.'

William Hunt, Windsor Herald at the College of Arms, which maintains official registers of coats of arms and pedigrees, said Lord Benn had been entered onto the Register of Hereditary Peers after proving his right to succession.

He said: ‘Tony Benn’s elder brother was killed in the war and Tony Benn did not want to accept the peerage because he wanted to continue to sit in the House of Commons.

‘Until the hereditary peers as a body were abolished you could not sit in the House of Commons if you had a title.

‘So Tony Benn brought in this bill to renounce peerages but it was framed such that it was renounced by whoever but not for their successors.

‘His younger son Hilary is an MP but the elder son is not, he presumably wishes to go to the Lords to participate in politics as an hereditary peer if he is elected.’

Lord Benn did not respond to requests to comment.
