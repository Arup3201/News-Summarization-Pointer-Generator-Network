It is the dream of many safari holidaymakers, seeing the African wildlife up close.

But Garth Kew wasn't expecting an elephant to turn up on his doorstep.

The amateur photographer was terrified when he looked out of his window at the Madikwe Game Reserve in South Africa to see an elephant looking back at him.

The holidaymakers grabbed his camera and ventured outside to snap some pictures

The wildlife lover had the fright of his life when the wild animal came so close to his holiday accommodation.

But he grabbed his camera and managed to capture some pictures from the safety of his room.

After a while, he realised the curious elephant was just have a look round and ventured outside to photograph the animal enjoying the sunshine.

Madikwe is a 'Big 5' game reserve and lions, elephants, buffalo, leopards, and rhinos wander freely.

As the lodge is on the bank of a river it is a popular watering place and Mr Kew has even heard of elephants drinking from the holiday home's outdoor showers.

The elephant didn't seem to pose a danger and was believed to be looking for water to drink

Mr Kew said the elephant seemed to just be having a nose around the camp

Mr Kew said: 'The elephant wasn't lured or encouraged - I don't know how that could have been done.

'It was simply ambling down to have a drink.' 

After managing to capture the magical shots, Mr Garth saw the elephant amble off back into the bush.
