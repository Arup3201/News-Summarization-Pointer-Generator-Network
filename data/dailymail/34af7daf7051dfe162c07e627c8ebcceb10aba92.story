Tragedy: Alex Hollinghurst died early Saturday - but police could have had an opportunity to stop her and Goode when they encountered them at a Walgreens pharmacy in Florida 24-hours before they allegedly died

Officer Robert German was gunned down in Windermere, Florida on Saturday evening– just one hour’s drive from the site in Kissimmee where the couple came close to capture.

At 10.02am on Friday 21 March Officer Martinez spotted the couple’s car in the pharmacy parking lot. Polk County police had issued an alert deeming Goode and Hollinghurst ‘missing endangered,’ following the discovery of suicide notes left they had written.

According to Officer Martinez: ‘I was on duty driving a marked police car…I was wearing a police uniform complete with all insignia and a badge identifying me as a police officer. It was a bright, sunny day and there was no confusing I was a police officer.’

He approached the car with his service weapon ‘drawn low and ready.’

Goode initially told the officer that he and Alex were ‘in town trying to sell jewelry for much needed cash’ before admitting his true identity and that he was from Davenport.

Corp Martinez motioned to his partner, waiting in their car, and beckoned him to come and take Hollinghurst out of the car while he moved round to apprehend Goode.

But he stated, ‘Goode reached for the ignition started the vehicle and placed it in drive.

‘I was standing just to the rear of the driver side door,’ he wrote. ‘And began to reach for Goode before he could place the vehicle in drive but realized I still had my department issued firearm in my hand.’

In a moment that could have changed the course of events which have left three people dead, Martinez recorded: ‘I jumped back as the vehicle lurched forward nearly striking me.’

Goode then drove ‘eratically’ out of the parking lot, swerving violently before righting the car and speeding off.

In the police report later filed Goode and Hollinghurst are charged with resisting arrest without violence and Goode with reckless driving.

This comes as it was announced that the British teenager suspected of shooting dead a Florida police officer had recently been thrown out of her home by her parents after rows over her boyfriend and her arrest on drug offenses.

Alexandria Hollinghurst and her boyfriend Brandon Goode gunned down a police officer in a wealthy suburb of Orlando on Saturday before apparently taking their own lives. Authorities said the teenagers had both left behind suicide notes.

The tragedy came after Hollinghurst, who was born in the north of England, moved in with Goode after her parents Matthew and Debra objected to his 'druggie' lifestyle.

Police records also reveal he had threatened his mother with an axe when he was just 16.

Last month, she was arrested with him after they were found to be in possession of marijuana but as she is a juvenile, details of her court appearance are not for public record.

Her name was redacted from the arrest report, but a police source confirmed she was the 17-year-old girl who was arrested with Goode on February 24th was Hollinghurst.

It was this incident that led to Hollinghurst moving out of her parent's home in Davenport, Florida.

'Matthew and Debra tried to stop Alex from seeing this guy and they just kept on rowing,' said a friend. 'The arrest last month was the final straw for them, and she moved out after rowing all the time. She was coming home at all hours.'

Friends of Hollinghurst said her parents, who emigrated from Manchester in 2011, disapproved of Goode who was previously arrested for aggravated assault when he threatened his mum with an axe.

In the 2012 incident, he had painted his face black, covered the windows of his home, armed himself with an axe and when his mother returned home, he demanded she accept his father's divorce settlement, the Orlando Sentinel reported.

'Alex had moved into Brandon's home because her parents threw her out,' said a friend who attended the same high school as the teenagers. They did not like Brandon because he was involved in drugs and made no secret that he liked to smoke weed.'

Neighbors of Goode, who lived with his divorced mum Connie, confirmed that they often saw blonde Alex at the home.

'She was here all the time, and a cute girl,' said neighbor George Koop. 'They would go out together in his car, often coming back late at night.'

On Monday, it emerged that the teenagers had been reported as being 'missing endangered' after two separate notes were found by their families.

As police only recovered one weapon it would seem the teenagers took it in turns to shoot themselves as part of a suicide pact.

Their bodies were found 100 yards from where officer Robert German was gunned down. They apparently shot him after he stopped them during a routine foot patrol through the neighborhood.

A police spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Office said: 'The OSCO has been given suicide notes written by both individuals. The contents of those notes will not be revealed at this time, as the investigation is active and open.

'During the course of this homicide investigation, the OSCO investigations learned from Polk County authorities, that the suspects were considered missing endangered due to the suicidal notes.

'That information was entered by Polk County into the system.'

The discovery of the notes led to speculation that the pair had been considering 'suicide by cop' and set out to provoke the officer into opening fire on them.

It is not known why they shot German before he had a chance to use his service revolver or why they did not wait for other officers to arrive before taking their own lives.

German had called for back-up telling his radio dispatchers to say he was stopping the pair for suspicious activity. But when a patrol car arrived they found German shot in the head.

The officers then heard two gunshots and the bodies of Goode and Hollinghurst were found in bushes about 100 yards away.

The slain officer was wearing a body camera at the time and the footage will be reviewed as part of the investigation into the incident.

Hollinghurst originally came from Oldham in Greater Manchester, England and her family had emigrated to the U.S. about six years ago. Former neighbors have spoken of their shock.
