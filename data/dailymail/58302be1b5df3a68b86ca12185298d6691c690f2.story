A 21-year-old student from New Jersey was tragically killed on Saturday afternoon when the race car she was driving crashed into a wall.

Amanda Gambacorto from Belford, suffered severe head trauma following the incident at Wall Stadium Speedway at around 12.30pm. She was rushed to a nearby hospital but was pronounced dead an hour later.

Gambacorto was participating in a program for novice drivers and was driving a three-quarter midget race car when the tragic accident occurred.

Amanda Gambacorto from Belford, New Jersey, suffered severe head trauma after the novice driver crashed a three-quarter midget race car in a wall at the Wall Stadium Speedway on Saturday afternoon

According to police, her car slammed head-on into a wall at the second turn on the track. No other vehicles were involved in the crash.

Gambacorto had only recently received her own three-quarter midget race car as a 21st birthday present from her father, reports News12.

The visit to the clinic, held by an organization called Green Flag Driving Experience, was also part of her present and both parents were at the track.

A friend of Gambacorto's family said her parents were too distraught to talk publicly about their daughter’s death.

The crash happened at the Wall Stadium Speedway in New Jersey at around 12.30pm on Saturday

State police have said that their initial review indicates that all required safety equipment was in place.

A 
three-quarter midget is an open-wheel miniature race car, which at 75 
percent the size of a full midget is 8 to 9 feet in length and weighs 
about 650 pounds, reports Ashbury Park Press.

The
 three-quarter midgets 'are small-scale race cars with a very high 
power-to-weight ratio, which use four-cylinder engines,' according to the Green Flag Driving Experience website. The cars can go faster than 90 mph on the banked oval asphalt track.

Gambacorto worked as a marketing assistant and communications intern at Stony Brook University, in Stony Brook, New York, where she attended school.

She was double-majoring in environmental humanities and philosophy, according to her LinkedIn page.

Her fellow sisters from the Alpha Sigma Alpha sorority sent their condolences, saying, ‘For those who didn't know Amanda that well, she was a fiery spirit who would try anything once.’
