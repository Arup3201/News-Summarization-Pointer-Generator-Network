Wow! As the toddler spots the locomotive wheeling towards him, he points and smiles before ecstatically screaming with his mouth wide open

When the train has gone George suddenly stops squealing.

'The train!' he says, looking longingly after the high-speed string of carriages.

He then mutters a jumble of words at the camera in a state of distress. 

The infant's dramatic reaction to the train was captured by his father, Antony, over the summer.

To date, the video titled 'what my son does next will leave you in stitches' has been watched more than 1,000 times.

'Hilarious what a delightful son you have,' one commenter said after watching the excitable George in action.
