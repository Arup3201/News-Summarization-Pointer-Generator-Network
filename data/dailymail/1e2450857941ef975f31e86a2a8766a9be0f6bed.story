Former heavyweight world champion Herbie Hide has allegedly offered to help throw a world title fight for £1million

Former heavyweight world champion Herbie Hide has allegedly offered to help throw a world title fight for £1million, it was revealed today.

Video footage of Hide - nicknamed the destroyer - apparently boasting about being able to fix boxing bouts has been published by the Sun on Sunday. They also allege that Hide offered to arrange for cocaine to be bought.

Hide reportedly said: 'Whoever, which round you want, whatever you want as long as you put the money.

'I can guarantee one thing, you can get whoever is the favourite, you can get them to step down for a million pounds.

'You need a big name on good record — yeah, like myself!'

The twice-crowned champion talked about pulling another unwitting top boxer into the scam.

He described boxing as not about 'who is best' but instead called it a 'business'.

The 41-year-old British heavyweight also arranged for cocaine to be delivered to undercover reporters for £100 a gram, the paper claims.

The cocaine dealer claimed that Hide gave out the number of the reporters - posing as businessmen who were interested in organising exhibition bouts in the Middle East - to arrange a deal.

Police have confirmed they are investigating drug allegations.

Hide, nicknamed the Dancing Destroyer, reportedly lives in a £1.5million home in Norwich — the scene of tragedy last year when a 25-year-old was stabbed to death at a party.

Tafadzwa Khan - known as Taffy - was knifed up to three times in the chest when fighting broke out at the sportsman’s £1.5million mansion.

Mr Hide was not at the house at the time.

Hide tried to persuade reporters to bankroll his comeback.

Professional competitive bouts are officially recorded on a boxer’s record - allowing millions be punted on the outcome.

Hide is currently not licensed to fight, but he claimed he could easily obtain permission.

He said he would 'fight a bum' just to get warmed up.

Hide suggested the name of another big name fighter with an impressive winning record to take part in the championship bout - claiming 'money speaks'.

However, there is no suggestion that the other boxer has ever been involved in match-fixing

Hide explained how his inside knowledge could help fix betting on fights by staging press conferences and sparring sessions held before them.

These sessions are seen as key indicators of how fighters are likely to perform. They have a large impact on betting odds.

Hide attempted to justify the £1million bout fixing fee he was demanding by saying: 'Money speaks and that’s where you can get people that will do it.'

He said one boxer accepted a bung mid-fight to feign injury so his opponent would stay undefeated but warned reporters that he was 'telling them secrets'. 

After his heavyweight success Hide stepped down to cruiserweight and has won 14 successive fights and remains unbeaten at that weight.

There is no suggestion that any of his previous fights have been rigged.

A Norfolk Constabulary spokesman said: 'We have on Saturday 23 February, been handed information in the form of two short sections of video concerning alleged drug activity.

'The material appears to relate to an incident on 31 January 2013.

'The Police are examining this and working with the provider of the information to investigate the full circumstances.  Norfolk Constabulary takes allegations of illegal drug activity seriously and information passed to police is thoroughly investigated.'
