He started off as a tubby little ball boy, trailing around after his older brother, who learned to play with power so he wouldn't have to run.

Now 19-year-old Nick Kyrgios, the newest darling of Australian tennis, is preparing to play the match of his life: a final 16 showdown with Spanish legend and world No 1 Rafael Nadal on the hallowed grass of Wimbledon.

Kyrgios, just two weeks after being dubbed the 'next big thing' by Andy Murray, has stormed through the first three rounds at Wimbledon, stealing headlines after his giant-killing display against Richard Gasquet, in which he saved an incredible nine match points to shock the 13th seed.

Nick Kyrgios has come a long way from his days as a ball boy for his older brother in Canberra. He will now face Spanish legend Rafael Nadal

Nick spent his early years acting as his older brother Christos' ball boy, with his mother Norlaila saying 'he was quite proud of himself, walking around collecting the balls' 

But at the Kyrgios family home in Canberra, his mother Norlaila waits for the rest of her family to let her know the results of each game, clutching at her Malaysian circular jade necklace- an exact replica of the one Nick wears- for good luck.

The mother-of-three told the Daily Mail Australia that she gets far too nervous when watching him play at Wimbledon, instead preferring to reminisce of 'little Nick's' humble beginnings.

'He started playing tennis because my eldest son, Christos who is eight years older than him, was a tennis player - but not to Nick's level,' Norlaila said.

'He was Christos' ball boy – he would just follow him around and pick up his balls, and of course Christos had no mercy for his brother. Nick was a quite a chubby fellow at that age, and he was quite proud of himself, walking around collecting the balls.

Norlaila said her youngest son learnt his technique due to being 'too chubby' to run, opting instead to gain an advantage by hitting the ball outside of his opponent's reach to minimize how far he'd have to run himself

'But I felt sorry for him always following us around, so I asked him one day if he wanted to try. I gave him a try and, my god, he just whacked it! He really whacked it! And right over the net! The hand eye coordination was just… wow! So I kept feeding him balls.

'Just… wow! This tubby little thing and that arm strength – my goodness! It just started from there, but he didn't get a proper tennis lesson until he was about seven.'

Currently ranked No 144 in the world, Kyrgios – who is of Malaysian and Greek decent - will enter the top 100 after fighting his way back from a set down to beat Czech Jiri Vesely 3-6, 6-3, 7-5, 6-2 on Saturday.

Other tennis stars are also confident that he could make it to the top, including Andy Murray, ranked 5th in the world, who dubbed Nick the 'Next big Aussie star' in a recent tweet.

Kyrgios began tennis lessons at seven years of age after his mum noticed how powerfully he would hit the ball

'I gave him a try and, my god, he just whacked it!...This tubby little thing and that arm strength ¿ my goodness! It just started from there,' his mother told the Daily Mail Australia

But while the rest of the world ponders how the youngest man in the draw managed to rapidly make his way to the top after being ranked lower than 800th last year, Norlaila proves that mothers know best.

'He was still tubby [when he started his lessons] because he didn't like to run,' she laughed.

'I keep saying to people – the best thing about that period was that because he couldn't run to the ball, he would hit it super hard to a place so that the other guy couldn't hit it back to him.

'He wasn't eating the wrong things, he was just eating too much, I mean Malaysian and Greek food – who could refuse! So he was hitting so hard and accurate to the corners of the court because he couldn't run after it!'

Talented from a young age: Nick won the former junior world championships as well as the Australian Open boys singles title in January 2013

Nadal has admitted he is weary of his future opponent, saying 'He's a young player and young players are very dangerous'

The teenager is currently preparing for his fourth-round clash, set against 14-times grand slam champion Nadal.

Kyrgios has meanwhile expressed his enthusiasm for the latest challenge, even suggesting he's confident of a win.

'I'm overwhelmed with happiness. Making my fourth round at a grand slam and the opportunity to play Rafa, hopefully on Centre Court, it's an opportunity I'm just going to embrace,' he said.

'I never thought I would be seeing Nadal in my fourth round at Wimbledon in my 19th year. I thought it would take years and years of work to finally have an opportunity like that.

'Of course I have nothing to lose out there. Anything is possible.'

But it's not just about winning, according to his mother, who is proud to see how far her youngest child has come.

'At this stage I think it doesn’t matter if he wins or not because he got to Nadal on his own terms, not because it was a random draw pool – he got there himself,' she said.

'If he does win? That will just be ridiculous! I'll have to call him and say "Your mama wants to live – your mama doesn't want to have a heart attack!"'

'I'm super proud! But, it's not just "proud", it's just being happy that it's jelling for him. He's thinking about the right things on court. He has lost the plot before many times because of one bad call and he'll be thinking about that and then lose the next two games when he should just move forward.

'I'm just super proud he’s thinking about the game and not rushing.'

Humble beginnings: When asked how she would feel if ehr son won against Nadal, Noraila said 'That will just be ridiculous! I'll have to call him and say "Your mama wants to live ¿ your mama doesn't want to have a heart attack!"'

Nonetheless, Norlaila guaranteed that she and Nick’s father George, who is at London by his son's side, will carry on wearing all their good luck charms until the end.

Both of them wear the same necklace as Nick, a Malaysian circular jade, while his superstitious father ensures he wears the same shirt and the akubra hat he was wearing during his son's third win at every game.

Leading up to their game on Monday, Nedal has admitted to being weary of his future opponent.

'He's a young player and young players are very dangerous as always the young players have something special. They are able to play with no pressure. They are fresh,' Nadal said of Kyrgios.

'He has a great serve. He's an aggressive player. I saw him few times but not 50 times like other players so I cannot talk too much.'
