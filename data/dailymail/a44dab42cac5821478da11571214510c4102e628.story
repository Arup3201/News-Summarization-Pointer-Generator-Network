Former football star Paul Gascoigne (pictured in April) has been arrested after an alleged drunken assault at a railway station

Former football star Paul Gascoigne has been arrested after an alleged drunken assault at a railway station.

The 46-year-old ex-England and Newcastle player, who left rehab in the United States earlier this year, was held after an incident in Hertfordshire.

A Hertfordshire Police spokesman said: 'Police were called to a report of a man allegedly being drunk and disorderly at Stevenage railway station at 10.30pm on Thursday July 4.

'Officers attended the location and arrested a 46-year-old male on suspicion of common assault and being drunk and disorderly.'

A British Transport Police spokesman said the arrested man had been bailed to return pending police inquiries.

The Mirror reported that Gascoigne had grabbed a security guard by the throat before grabbing the arm of ex-wife Sheryl Gascoigne when she tried to step in.

According to the newspaper, he was bailed after being held in a police cell for 12 hours overnight.

A police spokesman told the newspaper there were two allegations of common assault, the first being against a station security guard.

The spokesman said a 46-year-old man is alleged to have grabbed the security guard around the neck, while the second allegation concerned a member of the public who arrived during the incident.

He is one of the greatest footballing talents England has ever produced, but Paul Gascoigne's has become as famous for his off-the-field antics as anything he ever did as a player.

During the Nineties his startling talent entertained millions, whether it was beating David Seaman from 30 yards in the FA Cup semi-final for Spurs or scoring his wonderful goal against Scotland at Euro 96 - chipping over Colin Hendry before volleying past the goalkeeper.

But even then his behaviour made headlines, he celebrated the Scotland goal by re-enacting the infamous, drink-fuelled 'Dentist's Chair' antics of his 29th birthday.

At the World Cup in 1990 he broke down in tears on the pitch when he picked up a booking which would have ruled him out of the final.

He married long-term girlfriend Sheryl 1996. The glamorous pair were briefly the Posh and Becks of their generation, the superstar footballer and his model wife.

But the romance was short-lived. The pair became embroiled in a high-profile divorce following allegations that Gascoigne had beaten her just two years later.

His football career petered out as 
alcoholism took over. Gascoigne first entered rehab in 1998 after reportedly drinking 32 shots of whisky in a session which left him 'rock bottom'. But he left after just two weeks of a recommended 28 day minimum stay.

His first trip to the rehab centre in Cottonwood, Arizona, was in 2001 where he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

After several unsuccessful spells trying to play football again in the States and later as a player coach at Boston United, Gascoigne acknowledged his footballing career was finally over.

Since then the trials and tribulations have only become ever-more bizarre. He has twice been sectioned under the Mental Health Act with one former lover claiming that he thought he was being chased by aliens.

He narrowly escaped bankruptcy after claims he owed the taxman £200,000.

In 2010, Gascoigne was said to have 'died' twice after being involved in a car crash with strangers in his home city of Newcastle.

A month later, he  appeared at the scene of killer Raoul Moat's 
final stand-off with police in the Northumberland town of Rothbury 
bearing a fishing rod, a chicken, a Newcastle United shirt, a can of 
lager and a dressing gown.

Friends and commentators have said that Gascoigne has never really had the help he needs. But so many have tried and failed to get through.

He said: 'The accusation is that he grabbed their arm.'

Earlier
this year, Gascoigne said he wanted to 'get back to reality' after the 
latest health scare in his battle with alcohol addiction.

He
told ITV1's Daybreak in March: 'I didn't ask to be an alcoholic, but I 
must admit I worked on it. I went to any lengths to get my drink, I'll 
go even further to stay sober.'

In
May, Gascoigne was pictured looking healthier than he had in years as he
celebrated his 46th birthday at the races with his family.

Gascoigne, who also played for Lazio and Tottenham Hotspur, went into rehab earlier this year after Radio 2 presenter Chris Evans and TalkSPORT presenter and former England cricketer Ronnie Irani organised it.

After he left the rehabilitation centre in Phoenix, Arizona, he told ITV's Daybreak how he begged doctors not to let him die.

He said he was rushed to hospital where medics did not think he was going to survive.

And in April he thanked the celebrities and footballers, including Wayne Rooney, Jack Wilshere and Steven Gerrard, who helped to pay towards his stint in rehab.

Hundreds of thousands of pounds were 
raised within just days to meet the £7,500-a-week clinic fees.

Gascoigne said afterwards a DVD 
message from Sir Alex Ferguson had helped save his life during his five-week
stay.

The 45-year-old said he watched the Manchester United manager and family and friends make emotional appeals for him to battle his demons.

Gascoigne said: 'I was blown away watching people like Sir Alex telling me to stay strong and pull through.

The move came following a charity 
appearance in Northampton during which the star appeared unwell and 
shaking, before breaking down and sobbing on stage in front of a room 
full of fans.

At the time he said that boredom was to blame for his latest setback in battling to overcome his addiction.
