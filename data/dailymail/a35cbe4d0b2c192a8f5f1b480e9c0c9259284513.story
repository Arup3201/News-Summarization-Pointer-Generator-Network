A 58-year-old woman died after crashing her Jeep through the fence of her apartment complex and plunging into the swimming pool yesterday - one day before she was moving interstate.

Diane Lobel was trapped underwater in her silver Jeep Cherokee for up to five minutes after driving into Massachusetts' Castle Village Estates pool just after 12.30pm yesterday. She was pronounced dead at the hospital. 

Neighbors said Lobel was planning to move to Florida today to 'escape New England winters' and her car was packed with most of her belongings.

Good Samaritan: Vito Martello pulled Diane Lobel from her submerged car

Condominium complex visitor Vito Martello had just had a swim at the 59 Highland Glen Drive complex pool when Lobel's car plunged through the fence and into the water.

The West Newbury resident told CBS Boston he dived into the pool and tried to pull the woman from the driver's seat, but she was trapped by the airbags.

'I heard the crash and I just jumped right into the water the minute the car hit the water so I was in there the same time as her trying to get her out and I couldn’t do that,' he said.

'When I tried to open the doors and everything was locked there. I said oh my God.

'I came on the passenger side and just kept yanking her out and finally she came loose a little bit I knew I could get her and I pulled her and I held the back of her head and up like this and everybody helped me get her out of the water.'

Lobel, from Randolph, had been underwater for up to five minutes when Martello began performing CPR on her.

Emergency services rushed the woman to Good Samaritan Medical Center in 
Brockton, where she was pronounced dead. 

Police Chief William Pace said he could not confirm whether the 
woman had a medical episode before the incident, which was under investigation. 

High impact: Diane Lobel, 58, crashed through the condo's fence and dived into the swimming pool

Neighbors said Lobel was a longtime 
resident of the complex who was planning to move to Florida today.

They said her car was packed with most of her belongings and she was running last minute errands, according to WCVB.com. 

'She showed me the house [in Florida]', close friend Mary Sheehan told Boston.com.

'She loved the house. She 
couldn’t wait to get there.'

Sheehan, 64, said her friend had 
health issues, including two prior strokes, and that she hadn't been 
feeling well recently, although they enjoyed their night out on 
Saturday.

She said she regretted not pushing Lobel to visit the doctor.

'I didn’t push it...Maybe if I had pushed it, maybe this wouldn’t have happened,' she said.

Curious: Lobel was parked at the front of the complex before she crashed through the fence

Another neighbor, Kim Mayberger, 45, said Lobel was a dedicated member of the apartment complex’s board of trustees.

'I'm just in total shock right now,' Mayberger told Boston.com.

Neighbors said the woman was originally from Long Island and worked as an administrative assistant at a local hospital. She had no children, was unmarried, and had no family in the area.

She lived alone with her dog, Willy, who was 'like a son'.

In 2007, the Patriot Ledger reported that Lobel was a staunch opponent of a permanent lifeguard at the condo's pool, saying the proposal was expensive and unnecessary, since the pool was used by a small number of people.

'It’s extremely restricted who gets in the pool. And everyone who lives there is a watchdog,' she said.

Martello, who pulled Lobel from her car yesterday, was the only person at the pool at the time and was a visitor at the complex. Other neighbors came out to help him after hearing the crash.
