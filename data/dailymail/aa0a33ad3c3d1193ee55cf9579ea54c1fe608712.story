While most cats love nothing better than lying indoors by the fire, five-month-old kitten Higgs is no ordinary feline.

He loves his owners, Christian Witte, 30, and Kimia Mohammadi, 25,so much that he cannot bear to be parted from them for a moment, which means that when they go for a walk, he goes too.

And if the weather's bad, he simply hops into Mr Witte's backpack.

Loving the great outdoors: Higgs the five-month-old kitten loves climbing into his owner's rucksack for a walk

Cling: Higgs may not look as if he's having the best time, but he hates to be separated from his owners

Backpacker: Higgs developed a love for travelling by rucksack after his owners put him there one windy day

The tiny kitten's love for the great outdoors emerged last month, when his owners went on holiday to the Scottish highlands and took their clingy pet with them.

When they went out for a walk along the coastline of Sanna Bay, little Higgs was so frightened by the strong winds that he scrambled onto Mr White's back and into his rucksack.

Now the tabby cat has made a habit of it.

Ms Mohammadi, who like Mr Witte is a PhD medical engineering student at Glasgow University, said: 'He gets quite cosy in the backpack, and he likes looking around at what's going on.'

She said: 'Christian organised the trip to the Highlands as a birthday surprise from me and, knowing how much I like Higgs, he decided to bring him along, too, although it was pretty random.

She said the couple went for a picnic on the windswept beach and took the kitten along with them because it doesn't like being separated from them.

'It was his first time being out in nature - he had never been outside our tiny flat in Glasgow's Merchant City before - and we didn't know how he would react.

'We were pleased when he came with us, but when the wind got up we were worried about sand getting in his eyes, so we put him in Christian's rucksack.

'Later, he was just running around but the wind was quite strong again, and he must have remembered about the rucksack as he climbed up on Christian and found his way into the rucksack.'

Ms Mohammadi said her pet had characteristics more suited to a dog than a cat.

She said: 'He likes crawling around and he fetches things as well - he is like a dog in cat's skin. He is quite a strange cat, but I really like him.'

The adventurous kitten is more like a dog than a cat, according to its owner, PhD student Ms Mohammadi

The couple took him to Glasgow Green last weekend, and because they had to cycle past an area popular with dogs to get there, they put him in Mr Witte's rucksack again.

Ms Mohammadi said: 'It would be great to have a dog-free park where Higgs could just run around.'

The couple named their kitten after Nobel Prize-winning British physicist, Peter Higgs, 84, who discovered the boson Higgs 'God particle'.

Ms Mohammadi added: 'I'm a very geeky scientist and so is Christian, and Peter Higgs got his Nobel Prize around the same time that we got him.

'I call him my fluffy particle.'
