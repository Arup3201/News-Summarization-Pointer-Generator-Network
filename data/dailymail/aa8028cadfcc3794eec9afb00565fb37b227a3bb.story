Stark future: Grower Colin Palmer has seen the disease strike his Christmas trees

It’s Britain’s favourite Christmas tree, found in five million homes and much loved because the needles do not drop and make a mess.

But the Nordmann fir may not feature in future celebrations because it is being attacked by a mysterious disease which causes its needles to fall off completely.

One of Britain’s biggest growers has already suffered hefty losses. Hans Alexandersen, owner of H. A. Trim, which farms 600,000 Nordmann firs in Kent and Surrey, says ‘hundreds of thousands of pounds’ worth of trees have been devastated.

Some other growers report losing a third of their stock.

There are now fears the price of Christmas trees, which has risen over the past few years, could jump even further because of shortages caused by the disease.

The condition – current season needle necrosis (CSNN) – has affected fir trees in the US and Europe for 20 years but was noticed in Britain for the first time only three years ago.

Since then the fungus, which causes needles to turn yellow in July, brown in August, then drop off completely, has spread around the country.

The British Christmas Tree Growers Association, which represents 300 growers, warned: ‘The disease could affect the number of marketable trees in future years if this continues.’

Outbreaks of the disease have affected 150 members of the BCTGA. Although most have reported damage to up to three per cent of their stock, some have experienced 15 per cent damage, and there are cases where a third of trees have been lost.

The Nordmann fir is a popular festive choice. It is not known why the disease has become so virulent among the tree

The dramatic figures mean a grower with 2,500 trees on just an acre could have lost 833 trees.

In such a case, with each tree fetching £25 wholesale, total losses would be £20,825.

Many growers invest in at least 6,000 trees, so losses could be as much as £50,000.

Colin Palmer, an adviser to the BCTGA, who has found disease  in some of his own trees growing near Ledbury, Herefordshire, said: ‘The disease is puzzling. It  is connected to a fungus, Sydowia polyspora, which has been around for 30 years without a problem.

‘We used to see trees lose their needles after strong sunshine. It was like sunstroke – annoying but not serious.

'But it has gone from benign to aggressive and we are trying to find out why.’

It takes eight years to grow a  6ft Christmas tree and most infected firs are being observed rather than chopped down.

Harry Brightwell, secretary of the BCTGA, said: ‘We’d like to reassure people not to be concerned as the trees they purchase should stay  green and healthy during the festive period.’

- The disease threatening to wipe out Britain’s 80 million ash trees has been discovered for the first time on National Trust land in the Lake District.

The ash dieback fungus, known as Chalara fraxinea, was found attacking 1,000 saplings less than 3ft tall on a ten-acre site between Borrowdale and Keswick.

They have now been removed to safeguard veteran ashes, some of which are 400 years old.

However, high winds forecast over the next few days mean they will not be burned until Tuesday.
