The family of a 14-year-old California girl who went missing on Sunday have discovered that she was posing as an older woman in online chat rooms.

Leah Kritzer was last seen at 4.30pm, when she told her parents, Joe and Anne, that she was taking the family dog for a walk in Manhattan Beach.

It is not the first time the teenager has been reported missing. On the previous occasion in January, police found her at a motel where she had arranged to meet someone.

Missing: Leah Kritzer's parents had feared the worse when their daughter disappeared while walking the dog

Her latest disappearance was discovered when a woman called the family home to say she had found their dog, which Leah was supposed to be walking.

Mrs Kritzer said she frantically searched the park and water front for her daughter before calling police.

The couple met the woman who found their dog, Popeye, but Leah was nowhere to be seen. She had also left her cell phone in her bedroom.

'There was our dog with the leash on and our daughter wasnâ€™t there and she hasnâ€™t come home since,' Mr Kritzer told KTLA 5, as he tried to hold back his tears.

There has been no sign of Leah since Sunday afternoon, but on Tuesday, her parents discovered she had been posing as 19-year-old in online chat rooms to meet men.

After spotting an unfamiliar number 
on her cell phone, the Kritzers called the number and spoke to a 
19-year-old man who said he had met Leah a few weeks ago.

He told the Kritzers that he quickly realized Leah was much younger than she claimed to be, and left.

Gone: Leah was reported missing after the dog she was walking was found wandering loose

The discovery had led the family to fear that Leah may have arranged to meet another stranger online on Sunday.

It
 is not the first time Leah has run away from home. Several hours after 
she went missing in January of this year, police found her in a motel. 
where she said she had met someone.

Detective Sergeant Paul Ford told Mail Online currently there was no evidence of foul play or that she had been abducted.

He said the police department was 
checking her activity on social media accounts to see who she had been 
talking to and whether she had planned to meet anyone.

A
 friend claimed to have seen the teenager walking back towards her house
 with an unknown man and her dog, shortly before she was reported 
missing.

'She was walking towards home. That's what's so frightening,' Mrs Kritzer said. 'It looked like she was coming home.'

Worried: Joe and Anne Kritzer haven't seen their daughter since Sunday afternoon

Detective Sergeant Ford said his department was looking into the identity of the man Leah was last seen with.

Manhattan Beach Police is asking anyone with information about the missing teenager, who is 5ft 7in and has blonde hair with orange tips, to call 310 802-5140.
