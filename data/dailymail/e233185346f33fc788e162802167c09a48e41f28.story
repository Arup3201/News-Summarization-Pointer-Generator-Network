A British Gas customer today slammed the company after it took nearly £17,000 from his bank account when it accidentally overcharged him on his monthly bill.

Businessman Oliver Wotherspoon, 32, returned from holiday earlier this month to find that the energy giant had mistakenly charged him 100 times more than usual - and that they had taken the astronomical sum directly from his company account.

Mr Wotherspoon, whose energy bills normally cost £150 a month, was told that the error occurred after an 'incorrect meter reading' - but the company still refused to give his money back.

Eventually Mr Wotherspoon had to contact a solicitor who demanded the firm return the £16,670.57. It was returned to Mr Wotherspoon’s account after an 11 day legal stand-off.

Normally Direct Debit users are protected
 by a guarantee which means if an error was made, the account holder is 
entitled to a full refund paid by the bank or building society. However,
 Mr Wotherpoon's bank said the figure went above the amount protected by
 the guarantee.

Mr Wotherspoon, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who runs a company which makes play areas for schools said: 'I’ve built up business from scratch through blood sweat and tears and yet a big bully company like British Gas can come along and taken away my cash flow.

'It was blatantly obvious the bill was wrong yet they took my money without of any thought of what such a giant transaction might do.

'Thankfully I did have some reserve funds to dip into so that money was able to keep things going but we are two weeks behind on jobs.

'If British Gas had held onto the money any longer, I would have had to put everything on hold for considerably longer. It was a massive worry and all of a sudden our guys were panicking that they may not be paid.

The bill shows Mr Wotherspoon's account after British Gas refunded £16,670.57. A spokesman said: 'Unfortunately we applied an incorrect meter reading to his account which meant he received a large bill'

'Getting the wrong bill is one thing but the physical taking of the cash from my account is another. As far as I’m concerned British Gas are hypocrites when keep going on about looking after their customers.

'What they did is an absolute joke, they haven’t contacted me once to say sorry.'

The incident occurred on August 4 while the father-of-two was on holiday in Majorca with his wife Tamsin, 32, expecting his regular £150 bill to be taken out by direct debt.

He added: 'We came back all jolly until I opened up the bill from British Gas. Initially I just burst out laughing and literally pointed at the figure and said "god they have got that a bit wrong" - then I saw the direct debit date and saw that it was that day.

'I logged onto the banking and saw that it had been taken out and immediately I just started to panic.

'When I called them up I was put through to customer services but they wouldn’t let me speak to a manager. They were really unapologetic that they had made a mistake.

'I said I wanted my money back immediately but they said they weren’t authorised to return it. The whole process was taking up vital time and in this time I was worrying thinking how am I going to pay for materials and the guys each week.

'Every day I was waking up thinking "they have got almost £17k of my money".

'I have three employees and I have up to 10 others working for me day in day out so it’s a lot of money going out. I need the money back fast.

'I had to slow the process right down, slow down buying materials until I got it back. It was only when I got a solicitor on the case that they started jumping and gave us the money back. British Gas hasn’t made any effort to contact me.

'Every time I called them they said they hadn’t started the process of the claim. It was an absolute farce, I was just passed from pillar to post. '

Mr Wotherspoon, who has since cancelled his direct debit and said he will pay by cash in future, added: 'British Gas said there was three meters in the workshop and the guy who read them got confused and read them wrong, it was human error - but it left me with an astronomical bill.

'I’m always really careful with my money, the way I built up the business and that’s what I pride myself on. I’m proud to say I don’t have any credit cards I don’t have any debts and I’ve always had money there to pay my guys and I’ve worked hard to get here.

'I have got the money back but its been a nightmare and I would like a hand-written apology. I just feel like the "big boys" are pushing round the small fry.'

British Gas refunded the £16,670.57 on August 15, and said that although it did apologise to Mr Wotherspoon initially, it should have contacted Mr Wotherspoon’s bank when the issue was raised on August 4.

A spokesman said: 'We are very sorry we sent a large bill to Mr Wotherspoon. Unfortunately we applied an incorrect meter reading to his account which meant he received a large bill.

'We should have provided a refund at the time including any associated costs. We will contact Mr Wotherspoon to apologise for distress and inconvenience caused.'
