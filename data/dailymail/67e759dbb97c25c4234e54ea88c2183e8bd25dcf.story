A sex abuse victim has revealed how her paedophile stepfather abused her from the age of nine and her mother still does not believe she was indecently assaulted.

Jemma Sanders, 28, suffered at the hands of Christopher Gibson for six years and has waived her right to anonymity so she can help fight child abuse.

Gibson was convicted of ten charges of indecent assault earlier this month and jailed for eight years but Miss Sanders' estranged mother Debbie has refused to accept his guilt.

Brave: Abuse victim Jemma Sanders has waived her anonymity to reveal how she was abused by her stepfather and how her mother stood by him

Miss Sanders said: 'I know now that he touched me inappropriately but at the time I didn't know it was wrong. He was my dad and I just felt loved.

'I remember thinking, "my daddy thinks that I'm my mummy". Every time it happened from then on I thought it was normal.

'As I was getting older the abuse was changing and the touching was getting more serious.

'We had sex education in school and that was when I began to realise it was wrong.

'He'd always told me it was 'our little secret' and he wasn't violent so when I was young I'd never known it was wrong.'

Jailed: Christopher Gibson will serve up to eight years after abusing Miss Sanders between the age of nine and 16

Gibson, 49, came into Jemma's life when she was just a year old and her mother and biological father split up.

The whole family moved to Withywood, Bristol, where the 28-year-old remembers an uneventful early childhood.

She always thought of Gibson as her father and enjoyed the love and attention he showed her and her brothers.

But he started abusing her from the age of nine and it continued for six harrowing years.

Jemma admits she went off the rails in her teens and became a 'wild child', staying out until all hours, drinking and stealing cigarettes.

At one party she got drunk and told a friend what he had been doing to her.

In 2003, aged 17, Jemma finally made the decision to tell her mother what had happened to her - but she has always refused to believe her.

'I felt it was time I told my mum what had happened,' she said.

'I said "mum, I've got something to tell you," she said "are you pregnant?' but I remember saying "no, it's worse than that, you'd better sit down".

'I told her what had happened and straight away she went off on one, calling me all the names under the sun, she didn't believe me at all.

'I went to my nan's house and, although she believed me, she persuaded me not to press charges - she said it would destroy the family and be the worse thing I ever did.'

In November 2012 she was approached by a police. A detective persuaded her to speak out and Gibson was arrested and charged with 11 counts of indecent assault and two charges of indecency with a child.

Gibson denied the charges but was found guilty on ten counts at Bristol Crown Court earlier this month.

'When he was found guilty I was in complete shock. After ten years of people not believing me I was shocked that someone finally had,' Miss Sanders said.

'My mum refused to hear my victim impact statement when he was sentenced and has never given me a proper chance to tell my side.

'It was the abuse that has destroyed our family, not me, and I want my mum to know that.

'I still suffer with depression and have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress. I'm upset at what this has done to my family but I know now that it's not my fault. I was a child and he was supposed to be my dad.

'I wouldn't want anyone else to go through what I went through.'

Detective Constable Kerina Balchin said: 'The victim in this case has been extremely brave to waive her legal right to anonymity in order for her voice to be heard.

'I hope this conviction will encourage victims of abuse to come forward in the knowledge that they will be heard and supported by the criminal justice system and that every effort will be made to secure justice for them.'

Her mother's decision to stand by her husband and refuse to believe her daughter was reported in open court.

She walked out of the courtroom before her daughter's victim impact statement was due to be read by the judge.
