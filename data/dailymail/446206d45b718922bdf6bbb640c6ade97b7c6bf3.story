An ex-Royal Navy officer has claimed reports that he was heading to
 Somalia to fight pirates are 'nonsense'

Former lieutenant Chris Enmarch’s decommissioned gunboat Defender raised suspicions among Spanish authorities last week after he was forced to stop off in Tenerife for repairs.

Civil Guard officers have carried out five inspections of the vessel and have refused to allow the heavily armoured converted warship to sail.

But Mr Enmarch, 53, of Penryn, Cornwall, said the Spanish authorities were making a 'fuss about nothing' and said the cannons on his boat were 'just for show and totally unusable'.

Angry: Chris Enmarsh, 53, said it was 'nonsense' to suggest he was intending to use his boat to fight Somali pirates

Following background checks on Mr Enmarsh, the Spanish authorities are believed to have been concerned by comments he made to a local newspaper in Essex in
 2011 that he intended to arm it for shipping and oil rig protection.

He told the Maldon Chronicle in 
November 2011: ‘Defender’s task will be to deter any pirates intent on 
boarding the many ships that pass the East African coastline. One look 
at her should be enough to send them looking for easier targets.

‘She will be manned by handpicked 
ex-Royal Marine Commandos and run as a professional naval ship, obeying 
the rules of engagement.

‘Our primary task will be to protect 
oil platforms which are towed close to the coast of East Africa, and a 
number of oil companies want to hire Defender to look after their 
interests.

‘We are not mercenaries; this is 
strictly a business venture similar to other British private protection 
firms which operate in Iraq and Afghanistan.’

But yesterday Mr Enmarsh told The Times it was a 'fuss about nothing' and said the Spanish authorities had gone 'totally overboard over nothing whatsoever.'

He said: ‘The reports of us heading to
 Somalia are nonsense. We would not have come down this way if our 
destination was the Horn of Africa. There are quicker routes to get 
there.

‘We are on our way from England to 
Senegal to discuss with the authorities there the possible use of the 
Defender as a deterrent against illegal fishing boats.

'The idea is that 
one look at us and anyone who should not be fishing there will think 
twice about staying.

‘We have been searched from 
top to bottom and nothing improper has been found. The only reason we 
have to stay is because the inspectors say our on-board safety equipment
 is not up to standard.

Eight former Royal Marines are understood to be on board the vessel, which was heading to East Africa to protect oil platforms on the East African coastline from pirates

Mr Enmarsh said the cannons on his boat were 'just for show' and 'totally unusable'

‘We need to get new fire extinguishers
 and some other items before we are cleared to depart. The crew have not
 been detained in any way.’

The 127ft boat, which weighs 135 tons,
 was built in Lowestoft, Suffolk, in the mid-Seventies as a fast attack 
craft for the Sultan of Oman’s navy in the Gulf.

The ship was decommissioned in 2002. Mr Enmarch is thought to have bought it two years ago.

Local maritime officials impounded the
 vessel last week after an inspection found ‘administrative 
irregularities’ and security issues relating to life-saving equipment.

The drama began on Tuesday, April 23 
when the Defender made an unplanned stopover in the resort of Los 
Cristianos after blowing a gasket.

It was boarded by Spanish Civil Guard 
officers and refused permission to stay there. The vessel was then 
escorted to a berth 50 miles away at Santa Cruz port by a Spanish navy 
warship.

Officials are understood to have been 
suspicious that the formidable looking vessel, which flies the British 
flag, was registered as a pleasure boat.

The boat has been inspected five times
 but officials have refused the skipper permission to sail. Mr Enmarch 
and his five-man crew have not been held.

Mr Enmarch said 
yesterday that only he and one other crewman had served in the Armed 
Forces.

The Spanish ministry of defence said 
an inspection had revealed ‘irregularities in the paperwork of the boat 
and its crew, as well as deficiencies in safety equipment’.
