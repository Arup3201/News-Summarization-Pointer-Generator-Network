It would take a brave soul to strip off and bare all for new reality show Naked and Afraid.

Deposited in the jungle without food and water, their breath jagged and shallow, and their nerves on edge,the contestants come face to face with hyenas and poisonous snakes, with one muttering: 'God, we're so screwed'.

Six strangers were put together for the Discovery show, debuting on Sunday, and stranded in the wilderness.

And despite all being experienced survivalists, they're still scared senseless as another admits: 'This is one nasty place...I'm naked in the land of venomous snakes!'

Survival of the fittest: Nude castaways star on Discovery's Naked and Afraid. 

Naked and Afraid is billed as taking 'survival of the fittest' to the next level - and dubbed 'the Everest of survival challenges'.

Each week, a new pair of complete and total strangers - one man and one woman - will find themselves stranded in and, quite literally, exposed to some of the world's most extreme weather environments.

Each duo will be left high and dry with no food, no water and and no clothes. They must survive on their own for a full 21 days, with nothing but one personal item each.

The dramatic trailer says that humans can only go three days without water - with the human body beginning to shut down after three weeks without food.

And contestants are seen desperately scrambling for something to eat, with one woman seen killing a fish as her partner yells 'chop its head off', as tells it 'you're my dinner.'

While another kills a snake, telling the camera: 'It will still bite you even though I cut its damn head off.'

Scared: Kim Shelton, 22, a student from Minnesota, stripped off for the Discovery show.

The contestants are:Shane Lewis, 40, an electrician from Connecticut who has backpacked around the world. He grew up in foster care and had to adapt to constantly-changing living circumstances.

He took off midway through his college education to backpack across the
 world and has now been to over seventy countries.

Shane's teamed up with student Kim Shelton, 22, from Minnesota, who grew up in England but spent every summer in remote Minnesota and has been to wilderness awareness school for two years

EJ Snyder, 46, from North Carolina, is a military and survival expert who joined the military aged 19 and is now retired.

He's paired up with Kellie Nightlinger, 38, an adventure guide from Alaska, who worked in law enforcement and as a rock minor. She is now a guide for glacier and whale watching adventures - and once survived in the Everglades for a week by herself, even being harpooned by an alligator.

Jonathan Klay, 36, a former Marine and bodyguard from LA joined Alison Teal, a 27-year-old surfer and filmmaker from Hawaii who currently lives in a Robinson style grass hut that she built with her parents over the last 20 years.

Survival instructor and country and western singer-songwriter Clint  Jivoin, 24, from Indiana, says that ninety percent of his diet comes from his own hunting and wild edible plants; however, he is adamant in his disdain for sport hunting: “Disgusting and despicable; if you kill it, then you’d better eat it.”

And Clint was teamed up with Laura 
Zerra, 27, from New Hampshire, a taxidermist and survival instructor, 
who has a love of danger and has hitchhiked her way around Mexico.

Billy Berger, 39, a writer from Georgia who loves deer hunting joins Ky Furneaux, a
 39-year-old award-winning stuntwoman from LA, who grew up in the 
Australian Outback - and who vowed to spend most of her time outside 
after breaking her back in a car accident.

Tattoo artist Puma Cabra, 38, from Nevada, was a professional snowboarder and could
 then disappear for multiple days with nothing but his knife and his 
knowledge. He has encountered mountain lions and pulled himself out of 
six avalanches.

He joins Julie Wright, 30, a wilderness instructor from Washington, who has happily lived off the land.

‘I’m an ultimate survivalist,’ Kellie Nightlinger, 38, told the Daily News.

Nightlinger
 said she had been starving after spending two weeks in the wild when 
she devised an innovative way to catch fish using her private parts as 
bait and then trapping her meal between her legs.

‘We needed something with protein and
 because the water was so muddy, traditional fishing methods wouldn’t 
work, so I had to improvise, adapt and overcome,’ said Nightlinger.

During
 the night time, the female survivalist and her partner on the show, 
E.J. Snyder, a retired Army veteran, used a fire that they lit by 
rubbing sticks together to keep hyenas away.

‘They were frightening, but at least they seemed to be afraid of fire,’ she told the Daily News, as EJ is seen to see hyena paw prints, adding: 'This is a hyena print, if there's one, there's more.

Other episodes of ‘Naked and Afraid’, featuring different nude paired up strangers, have been filmed in Panama, Costa Rica, the Maldives and Borneo.

‘I think the challenge brings out the
 very best and very worst,’ the show’s executive producer Steve Rankin 
told the Daily News  from a hospital bed in Costa Rica where he was 
recovering after being bitten hours earlier by a venomous snake while 
working on the show.

‘The
 idea here is to push the ball down the field,’ Discovery channel 
executive, Craig Coffman has said: Survival shows are so common now that
 it’s gotten more and more difficult to convince the audience that what 
they’re watching is something extreme.

‘Having no clothes just takes it to the next level. It’s the ultimate test and makes survival exponentially more difficult.’
