THE Environment Secretary has been targeted by animal rights militants who have published photos of his home online as part of a campaign of ‘intimidation’ against a controversial badger cull.

Concerns: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, who last week approved the badger cull trials

Owen Paterson – who last week approved the cull in Gloucestershire to try to stop the spread of TB among cattle – was forced to obtain a High Court injunction against the website, which also lists his address and office phone number.

Although activists removed the information, within hours it  had reappeared on a ‘mirror’ site hosted in Australia but easily accessible in the UK through a simple Google search.

The website claims a high-level Civil Service mole, sympathetic to their cause, went ‘out on a limb’ to leak the private details.

It has also published addresses and phone numbers for senior Defra civil servants, board members of Natural England, which is licensing the cull, and officials at the National Farmers Union.

The Mail on Sunday is not revealing details of the website to protect those named. We have also established the identity of the British woman behind it but for legal reasons – linked to an unrelated police investigation – she cannot be named.

The site, which advises protesters to ‘stay legal’, carries photographs of Mr Paterson’s North Shropshire home under the headline ‘House on the hill. Owen Paterson has a posh place’.

There is also an aerial shot and a view of the main entrance gates – key information for any extremist planning to trespass.

It will also concern police given Mr Paterson’s previous role as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, where he was an obvious target for terrorist groups.

Text on the anti-cull website boasts Mr Paterson is ‘very, very angry about the site publishing his office phone number.

Many people are ringing it and playing the “badger badger” song to him’.

This is a reference to a YouTube video in which cartoon badgers dance to a soundtrack.

Culled: Badgers are to be culled in a bid to stop the spread of TB among cattle

The website adds: ‘Below is the rest of the ministers [sic], this was leaked to us by someone who is high up in the civil service.

Please put a few minutes to one side each day to contact them.’

Martin Haworth, director of policy at the National Farmers Union, said: ‘We are very disappointed this has happened.

We have asked Defra and Natural England how this information could have been discovered.’

Natural England declined to comment on the leak ‘for security reasons’.

A Defra spokesman said last night that its databases had not been compromised.

 Police are preparing for fast-track prosecutions against activists who launch night protests against the badger cull.

Farmers taking part have been asked to sign a police witness statement known as an MG11, saying they have not given permission for anyone to disrupt the cull.

By collecting the forms in advance, police hope they can bring about charges more quickly.

Animal rights activists have been accused of using the travel website TripAdvisor to harass a farmer organising the badger cull.

Harassed: Jan Rowe

Jan Rowe, 67, says that militants have posted malicious reviews about his wife Gill’s farmhouse B&B in an attempt to undermine her business.

The comments appeared shortly after the names, addresses, emails and telephone numbers of farmers allegedly involved in the cull were published on the internet.

Mr Rowe said: ‘It was obvious they were by animal rights people.

They said the smell was terrible and suggested it was caused by the badgers we had nailed to the wall. 

‘There were similar comments and it was clear they were from people who had never been here.

Someone even wrote we would take guests badger-hunting.

It was all nonsense.

But it is deeply upsetting for my wife.’

Although Mr Rowe’s farm in Whittington, near Cheltenham, is outside the area of the Gloucestershire cull, he has become a target after agreeing to be a director of GlosCon Ltd – the firm set up to organise it.

TripAdvisor has since taken down the offending review
