Under 18s? Under 21s? There really is no difference when you can strike the ball like that.

Kasey Palmer came off the bench to score a cracker on Tuesday night as Chelsea’s under 18s thrashed Huddersfield Town 6-1 in the fourth round of the FA Youth Cup.

24 hours later, on the very same pitch, he produced another stunner for the under 21s. It left Palmer’s right boot like a cannonball, always rising and swerving, making the goalkeeper’s dive look pathetic as it crashed into the top corner.

It cancelled out Andre Silva’s early opener for Porto in this Premier League Under 21 International Cup encounter and Kyle Scott’s late winner was enough to see the Blues through their group and into the knockout phase.

The goal will do wonders for Palmer’s burgeoning reputation too. Signed from Charlton with a little controversy and plenty of compensation midway through the 2012-13 campaign, Palmer, just 18, has graduated quickly to Chelsea’s under 21 set-up.

He looks right at home and with a sweet hit like that, not to mention the stamina and dedication to play two nights on the trot, he could go far.

It was tricky to draw too many permutations from Group A ahead of this one. Chelsea knew a victory would see them safely through with all three of their fixtures completed. Porto, meanwhile, were inking the first page of their International Cup history.

The Blues had already drawn 1-1 with Borussia Monchengladbach and thrashed Norwich 5-0 but this technically-gifted, fleet-footed and skillful Porto side was always going to be the toughest test.

The soaking conditions in Aldershot only made for a slick surface, glistening under the floodlights, that seemed to suit the styles of both teams and the contest started at a lightning pace.

Ruben Loftus-Cheek tried to take advantage of the extra pace on the grass inside four minutes, firing in a low shot that goalkeeper Aldo Nonteiro dived on top of.

And the visiting keeper was scrambling when Palmer sent a low shot creeping past the post after finding an angle in the penalty area.

But Porto moved the ball confidently and took the lead on the quarter-hour. A searching ball from the right-wing wasn’t dealt with by Chelsea keeper Jamal Blackman and Silva angled his body to divert a shot towards the unguarded goal.

Blues skipper Jordan Houghton dived full-stretch through the six-yard box to try and intercept it but could only help the ball home.

Chelsea weren’t in arrears for too long, however, and there were audible gasps around the ground when Palmer’s thunderbolt rippled the top corner of the net, followed by enthusiastic applause.

It wasn’t long before the Vine was circulating on Twitter - it was a goal thoroughly deserving of a broader audience than the few hundred hardy souls here.

Palmer was certainly in the mood and a whipped free-kick from 25 yards narrowly cleared the crossbar though the closing minutes of the first-half certainly didn’t match its opening for entertainment.

He almost pulled off the trick a few minutes after the break, but again his free-kick had a little too much elevation.

The driving rain and biting, swirling wind sadly sucked the quality out of the contest and things weren’t helped when leading man Palmer was taken off for a well-earned breather midway through the second-half. It meant a first outing in Chelsea colours for Polish youth international Hubert Adamczyck.

Porto, who were backed by a very vocal knot of fans in the main stand, nearly retook the lead when Igor Osorio shot over when well-placed barely six yards out.

And at the other end, substitute Kyle Scott curled a shot into the keeper’s arms after Adamczyck teed him up with a cheeky backheel.

As the clock ticked down, Chelsea stepped up their push for a winning goal. It duly arrived in the first minute of stoppage time when Scott sized up a shot from just outside the box, used the defender as a shield to obscure the keeper’s view and bent the ball into the far corner.

It was the perfect end to the night for most present but it’s Palmer’s rocket that will stick in the memory.
