On the beach: Bob Crow relaxes in Rio as part of his £10,000 holiday

Bob Crow is facing a mounting backlash for masterminding two crippling rail strikes during a lavish £10,000 holiday.

The £145,000-a-year union chief has been accused of making empty promises over talks to avert the walkouts.

Last week the RMT was issuing statements in his name from London offering to meet the capital’s mayor Boris Johnson to solve the dispute over changes to the Underground. In reality, however, the firebrand was sunning himself in South America, thousands of miles away.

Fresh pictures show him dancing with his girlfriend Nicola Hoarau, 49, on of a cruise ship.

In others, the general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers union is seen visiting the statue of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

But on his return to Britain, he walked into a wall of criticism over the timing and cost of his jaunt.

The 53-year-old’s sun-soaked antics will anger some London Underground workers, who will lose out on wages when they begin their first of two 48-hour strikes tomorrow.

They will also infuriate millions of commuters from all over the country who will see their trips to the capital disrupted tomorrow and again next week.

Nick de Bois, Tory MP for Enfield, said: ‘Bob Crow wants to plunge millions of commuters into travel misery while his only priority seems to have been to plunge himself into a Caribbean swimming pool. I hope his hardworking members will see through his hypocrisy.’

Bob Neill, Tory MP for Bromley and Chislehurst, accused ‘champagne socialist’ Crow of showing contempt for workers.

And David Burrowes, Tory MP for Enfield Southgate, questioned how Crow could be ready for personal meetings while he was sunning himself abroad.

Last week Crow offered to meet Mr Johnson ‘face to face’ to reach a compromise ahead of the strikes. But he made the offer during his holiday, knowing there would be only one working day to resolve the dispute before the first walk-out.

Mr Johnson said last night: ‘Bob Crow is entitled to sun himself silly if likes. What he isn’t entitled to do is to hold London and her hardworking commuters to ransom.

'Call off the strikes Bob, towel off the
 sand from between your toes and perhaps then we can talk at City Hall. I
 can’t offer you a pina colada but we do a decent cup of municipal 
coffee.’

Thousands of workers are expected to strike for 48 hours from 9.30pm tomorrow and for another 48 hours from 9.30pm on February 11 over plans to close ticket offices.

Last week the Mail revealed how Crow, who lives in a council house in Woodford Green, East London, spent two weeks on the lavish cruise from Barbados to Brazil aboard the Silver Spirit liner.

His suite included a private balcony and marble bathroom, while guests on the ship could enjoy unlimited champagne and caviar and visit the casino, champagne bar, theatre, and six restaurants.

Fellow holidaymakers told how he ‘held court’ on the ship and was first up to sing at a karaoke night. The cruise reportedly cost Crow and his partner more than £7,000.

Lobster-red: Crow, reclining on Copacabana beach, works on his tan

At Rio, they checked into the £250-a-night five-star Windsor Atlantic hotel on Copacabana beach before going up Corcovado mountain.

On Wednesday Crow was seen turning a deep lobster red after lying in the 104F (40C) heat for three hours.

Talks aimed at averting the strikes will be held today at conciliation service Acas. Mr Johnson has offered to hold direct talks with the RMT if the strikes are called off, but Crow said he would meet the mayor face-to-face only if there were ‘no preconditions’.
