Motorists driving on a major road were shocked to see the rotting carcass of a huge whale being carried on the back of a lorry.

The 50ft sperm whale had been lying on a beach for five days after getting stranded on the Kent coast.

And when it was finally taken to a landfill site, the sight and smell of the leviathan proved to be too much for some motorists.

Surreal: Commuters spotted this enormous sperm whale carcass on the A2 in Kent

It was first spotted last Thursday, when the dead whale was stranded near the village of Seasalter.

After being towed on shore this week, the whale was loaded onto the back of a flat-bed truck and covered with a tarpaulin.

Boyd Roberts Casualty Livestock, a contractor specialising in the disposal of animal carcasses, took it along the A2 to a deep landfill site in Canterbury.

Commuter Mark Stephens, 41, saw the truck on its way to the landfill, with part of the whale hanging off the back.

'There was a Land Rover in front and behind, flashing orange lights and this massive whale with its head and tail chopped off,' he said.

'There was blood and guts dropping off the back and everything. The smell was unbelievable. I've worked near an abattoir and that smelled bad, but this was something else.

'It was incredible really. You would have thought given the state it was in they would have transported it at night. I don't think I'll see anything like that again.'

A spokesman for the contractor denied the suggestion that any parts had dropped off the carcass.

'The small parts were transported in a sealed container the day before, so there wasn't anything that could have dropped off,' he said.

A spokesman for Peel Ports, the company which manages the local harbour, said that it was not responsible for anything that happened during the transportation of the whale carcass.

'Because the whale carcass posed a potential threat to the navigation channel, a Peel Ports vessel was instructed to tow the carcass back to the port,' she added.

'The port contacted a licensed and experienced contractor in order to facilitate a responsible and safe removal from the port.'
