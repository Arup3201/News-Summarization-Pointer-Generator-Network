More Americans watched Belgium knock the United States soccer team out of the World Cup on Tuesday afternoon than the prime-time conclusions of the NBA series or the World Series.

An estimated 21.6million people watched the second round clash between the two teams this week, according to the Nielsen company.

The record U.S. television audience for a soccer match is the 24.7million who saw the United States take on Portugal on June 24, which was equal to the number that watched the 2010 World Cup final between Spain and the Netherlands.

Fans watch the game between the U.S. and Belgium in Chicago, Illinois. Organisers said 28,000 people turned up to watch the match at Soldier Field

The Portugal game however took place on a weekend, while the match against Belgium started at 4pm on the East Coast, and earlier in other time zones, on Tuesday.

According to Nielsen, which does not measure viewership in bars, offices or other public places, a total of 16.5million people watched the game on ESPN, with 5.1 million more seeing it on the 
Spanish-language Univision network.

In addition, nearly 1.7 million 
people watched an online stream of the event, Nielsen said.

The figures exceed the average viewership for the most recent World Series and NBA Finals, events that took place during prime-time when more people were home to watch.

The just-concluded NBA series where the San Antonio Spurs beat the Miami Heat averaged 15.5 million viewers, with 18million watching the final game.

Last fall's World Series averaged 14.9 million viewers, with 19.2million watching the Boston Red Sox beat the St. Louis Cardinals in the last game.

The viewing figures were still considerably lower than the number of people who watched this year's Super Bowl however, which set a new record for the largest U.S. television audience for a single broadcast after 111million people watched the Green Bay Packers' victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers.

U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann said everyone connected with the soccer team is excited to see how the sport is reaching a U.S. audience.

He said he could see it coming however, given the popularity of the game among young people and the large crowds that turned out for the team's sendoff games before the World Cup.

Klinsmann said: 'Soccer is breaking through and gets its deserved recognition without taking anything away from the other big American sports.'

He said it's important for people to identify with the way Americans played the game.

'The energy and the commitment and the tempo and the aggressiveness that we played with kind of made people proud at home and surprised a lot of people outside of the United States, maybe in Brazil or in Europe,' he said.

The highest overall ratings for the game between the U.S. and Belgium came in New York, Nielsen said.

ESPN said that overall viewership for the World Cup is up 44 per cent over 2010.
