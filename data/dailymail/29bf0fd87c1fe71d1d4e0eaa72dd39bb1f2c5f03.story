The mother of a 12-year-old boy, who accidentally hanged himself trying the 'choking game', has slammed internet site YouTube for showing videos encouraging the dangerous activity.

Erik Rogg, a promising student and former boy scout from Randolph, Nebraska, died two years ago trying the 'game' which as been going on for decades.

His mother Judy, who discovered him dead in his bedroom, has since become a campaigner touring schools in a bid to create awareness of the dangers of the fad.   

Tragic: Judy Rogg is campaigning for greater awareness of the dangers of the so-called 'choking game' after her 12-year-old son Erik died trying the dangerous pastime

But Judy fears it is seeing a resurgence in popularity partly because youngsters are posting videos of themselves doing it on YouTube and similar websites.

She told ABC's Nightline: 'A lot of kids make it look fun.

'They're laughing.They don't realise the kid's on the floor twitching because he's having a seizure.

'A lot of kids say "Well at least we're not doing drugs"

'They think it's an alternative and they don't understand they're killing themselves.''

'[Youtube is] making access to an incredibly dangerous practice .'

In 2006 more than 100 teens are believed to have died playing the dangerous game. The numbers decreased in recent years, but experts warn they may be on the rise.

Also known as the fainting game, tap out, hangman, elevator, and blackout it is often played by groups of teens who partner up and cause each other to lose consciousness, but it can also be played alone.

Derek Gall, a High School Sophmore, also from Randolph, smashed his head on a concrete floor when he tried it at school having seen a video on YouTube that claimed to show a 'safe' way to pass out.

His 12-year-old sister Maggie said it was popular with children in her a year and blamed YouTube for its popularity.

She said: 'If Kids are doing stuff on the Internet that is teaching these other kids to do really bad thins to themselves, then YouTube should take off those videos and not allow them on anymore.'

A spokesman for YouTube said: 'The safety of our users is important to us, and as such YouTube's community guidelines prohibit videos intended to encourage dangerous activities that risk serious physical harm.

'We routinely remove material according to these guidelines, and we encourage users to flag video for our attention so that we may continue to do so.'
