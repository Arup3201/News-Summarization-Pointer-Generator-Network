Reggie Bush will head back to his native California to fill the Frank Gore-sized hole in the 49ers backfield.

The 30-year-old was cut by Detroit after two mixed years; the first inspired, the second injury-hit. 

ESPN first reported the deal after Bush opted not to join the New England Patriots. 

Concerns about fitness will plague the running back but when healthy he adds a threat on the ground and in the air.

The 2005 Heisman Trophy winner was drafted second overall in the 2006 draft by the Saints. His five seasons in New Orleans yielded 33 touchdowns in 60 games and a Super Bowl victory. 

Bush moved to Miami Dolphins in 2011. He rushed for 2,072 yards, scoring 15 touchdowns over two seasons before joining the Lions in 2013. 

After going 8-8 and dispensing with Jim Harbaugh's services, the 49ers have undergone something of a facelift in the offseason.

After a botched interview with Adam Gase, Jim Tomsula was promoted from defensive co-ordinator to head coach.

And his short stint has seen the retirement of linebacker Patrick Willis, the loss of guard Mike Iupati to NFC West rivals Arizona and long-term staple Gore leave for Philadelphia.

Cornerback Perrish Cox also departed to sign a bumper $15million three-year deal with Tennessee.

The 49ers have added wide receiver Torrey Smith and defensive end Darnell Dockett and re-signed cornerback Chris Cook, as well as adding former rugby league sensation Jarryd Hayne to the roster.
