Glencore boss Chris Mahoney says the world food crisis is 'good for business'

The head of one of the world's leading commodities and agriculture companies has said the current global food crisis is 'good for business'.

Aid agencies, the United Nations and the British Government have all attacked Glencore director Chris Mahoney whose comments come after terrible weather has devastated almost half of this year's U.S. corn crop.

Mr Mahoney, who has accrued shares worth in the region of £500m, said Glencore was well placed to profit from the worst drought in the U.S. since the 1930s.

On a conference call the
company's Director of Agricultural Products said: 'In terms of the 
outlook for the balance of the year, the environment is a good one.

'High prices, lots of volatility, a lot of dislocation, tightness, a lot of arbitrage opportunities [the purchase and sale of an asset in order to profit from price differences in alternative markets].

'We will be able to provide the world with solutions, getting stuff where it is needed and that should be good for Glencore.'

The crisis in the U.S., which has also seen this year's soya bean harvest fall by 35 per cent, threatens to push up cereal prices to a record high which will spell more misery for some of the world's poorest people.

Russian president Vladimir Putin plans to ban grain exports and according to the senior economist of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation Concepcion Calpe businesses are trying to exploit the global crisis.

'Private companies like Glencore are playing an enormous game that will make them enormous profits,' she told The Independent.

Some banks such as Germany's commerzbank and DeutscheBank and Austria's Volksbanken have tried to distance themselves from Glencore by removing agricultural products from their investment portfolios.

Glencore was founded in 1974 and although it is listed on the London Stock Exchange its headquarters are in Switzerland.

Its operations affect the global price of zinc, steel, copper, oil and a number of agricultural products including grains oil seeds, cotton and sugar.

The firm employs about 57,000 people and turned over $145billion last year.

It has assets worth in excess of $79billion

It plans to takeover Xstrata this year, which if successful will be the biggest mining buyout in history.

Its £4bn takeover of grain supplier Viterra will see it control of most of Western Canada's and south Australia's grain storage.

However, Ms Calpe says hopes that the multimillion dollar company will discontinue trading in potential starvation and hunger in developing nations for ethical motivations would not be realised.

She added: 'Now is the time to change the rules and regulations about how Glencore and other multinationals such as ADM and Monsanto operate.

'They know this and have been lobbying heavily around the world to water down and halt any reform.'

Last month food prices rose by an average of six per cent globally and Oxfam has strongly condemned the lines being taken by major food traders such as Glencore.

Jodie Thorpe said: 'Glencore's comments that 'high prices and lots of volatility and dislocation' was 'good' gives us a rare glimpse into the little-known world of companies that dominate the global food system.'

She Glencore was 'profiting from the misery and suffering of poor people who are worst hit by high and volatile food prices.'

The drought in the U.S., the world leader in food trading, is so severe that G20 nations are contemplating holding an emergency summit.

Aid agencies, the United Nations and the British Government have all attacked the Glencore director Chris Mahoney whose comments come after a drought has devastated almost half the U.S. corn crop.

The last severe food crisis, in 2008, sparked riots in cities around the globe. The United Nations food agency warned this month that there is risk of such a situation developing again.

The UK is also concerned about the food crisis situation. Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for International Development Stephen O'Brien said: 'We know that food-price spikes hit the poorest hardest.

'Ensuring the poor can still access enough food is vital in times of food-price rises which is why the UK is investing in safety nets that deliver food and cash to the poorest.'

A Glencore spokesperson said: 'Regardless of the macro-economic environment, Glencore helps fulfil global demand by getting the commodities that are needed to the places that need them most.

'Our agricultural operations are spread across farms, silos, crushing plants and port facilities.

'Alongside our construction of much needed logistics and processing infrastructure to meet growing demand, Glencore works to support supply and aid the efficient flow of agricultural commodities around the world.'
