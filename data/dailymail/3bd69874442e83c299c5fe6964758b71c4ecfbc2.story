The final lessons remain etched in chalk in the empty lecture theatres and experiments have been left to rot in deserted laboratories.

For 75 years the science campus at Val Benoit University in Belgium was thriving, but now the classrooms and corridors are free from students and teachers.

Instead, all 30.000 square metres of the campus, formerly the Natural Science department, is encrusted with dust and decay.

School's out: A lecture theatre inside the abandoned Science campus at Val Benoit University, Belgium. The final lessons remain etched in chalk on the blackboard

Abandoned: For 75 years the science campus at Val Benoit University in Belgium was thriving, but now the classrooms and corridors are free from students and teachers

Decay: All 30.000 square metres of the campus, formerly the Science department, is encrusted with dust and decay

The site, now home to walls covered in cracked and peeling wallpaper and broken beakers, has been abandoned since 2005 when the facilities were moved to another site.

'You could still feel the energy and buzz of the former times,' says photographer Stefan Dietze, 31, who captured these melancholic scenes.

Born in Dresden, but now of Leipzig, Germany, Mr Dietze visited the university over the course of two days.

Mr Dietze said, 'You would expect a lot of noise from a place like this.

Eerie: 'You could still feel the energy and buzz of the former times,' says photographer Stefan Dietze, 31, who captured these melancholic scenes

'The sound of laughter, people running to their classes, doors slamming, but instead it was quiet.

'The only living creature I met was a little fox who ran off as soon as he spotted me.'

Mr Dietze became interested in Urban Exploration, the name given to photography projects taken in deserted settings, in 2004 after moving to Leipzig.

Mr Dietze said 'It's a city very much defined by decay. I found endless opportunities to practice my skills in old factories, obsolete power stations, schools and churches.'

Scampered: When photographing the building Mr Dietze spotted an occupant - 'a little fox who ran off as soon as he spotted me'

Dusty film: A piano covered with dust can be seen in one of the rooms that has not been used for years

Empty: A lecture theatre which once would have been packed with students stands empty and covered in dust

Captivating: Mr Dietze said 'I was especially fascinated by the laboratory. With all of the wooden desks and derelict chemical tools, it had a real anachronistic charm'

Expanse: A laboratory stands empty. Mr Dietze said, 'It's a very big place. You could easily end up lost in the long corridors'

Harsh elements: Many of the windows are smashed in and exposed to the weather the interior has started to deteriorate quickly

'Since then I made countless trips throughout Europe to find historic buildings that fascinated me.'

Val Benoit is the first university Mr Dietze has photographed and he spent a total of twelve hours inside.

Mr Dietze said, 'It's a very big place. You could easily end up lost in the long corridors.'

'I was especially fascinated by the laboratory. With all of the wooden desks and derelict chemical tools, it had a real anachronistic charm.

'It was breathtaking when I entered the auditoriums. They looked like they had only been abandoned days before.

'The most important thing for me as a photographer is to tell a story with my pictures.

'I want people to look at my photos and to start wondering what might have happened in the particular setting.

'Who worked and studied in this abandoned university?'
