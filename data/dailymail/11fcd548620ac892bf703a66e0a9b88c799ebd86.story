Researchers have revealed one of the best preserved fossil sites ever discovered.

The fossil site in Jehol biota in the north-eastern region of China has revealed scorched tissue, and 're-crystallized' sections of bone on fossil.

Experts say the site is similar to the effect of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79 buried Pompeii, Herculaneum and other cities, entombing people and animals in suspended death poses.

Typical entombment poses of some of the Jehol Biota¿s animals - a Psittacosaurus (a) and primitive crow-like birds (b and c). The poses are similar to those displayed by other victims of erupting volcanoes throughout history.

An ancient ecosystem known as the Jehol Biota existed in north eastern China about 120 million to 130 million years ago.

It consisted of dinosaurs, mammals, early birds, fish, lizards and other creatures, with the red areas highlighted below having thrown up fossils.

The animals lived among coniferous forests and lakes, in the shadow of volcanoes.

Fossils of these animals are found in the Yixian and Jiufotang rock formations, embedded in layers of volcanic material.

The team studied 14 fossils along with the chemistry and mineralogy of the volcanic rock and sediment that formed the animals final resting place.

'What we're talking about in this case is literal charring, like somebody got put in the grill," said George Harlow, a mineralogist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, one of the researchers of the study.

'The lower Cretaceous Yixian and Jiufotang formations contain numerous exceptionally well-preserved invertebrate, vertebrate and plant fossils that comprise the Jehol Biota,' the researchers wrote in Nature Communications.

'Freshwater and terrestrial fossils of the biota usually occur together within some horizons and have been interpreted as deposits of mass mortality events.

'The nature of the events and the mechanisms behind the exceptional preservation of the fossils, however, are poorly understood. '

The team believe that a massive volcanic eruption is to blame, when a scorching flood of rocks and ash petrified them.

In the left picture, subtly waved, planar-lamination in sediments is seen overlying the skeletons of a Psittacosaurus (a,b) and a Confuciusornis. The right hand image shows closeups of bone with black char marks visible.

Pompeii and Herculaneum were buried under a deep layer of ash in an eruption of the Vesuvius volcano, which towers over the Bay of Naples in southern Italy, in AD 79.

Just after midday on August 24, fragments of ash, pumice, and other volcanic debris began pouring down on Pompeii, quickly covering the city to a depth of more than 9 feet and causing the roofs of many houses to fall in.

Fine-grained volcanic ash that encloses the remains probably formed moulds around complete skeletons, resembling the intact, buried corpses at Pompeii.

Fresh, hot, dry, acid volcanic ash promoted burning, charring or mummifying of soft tissues, which, as a result, became more resistant to decay and better preserved.

The carcasses were then transported into low-lying volcanic lakes, where they remained until humans unearthed them, the team believe.

'After examining and analysing sediments and residual fossils from several key horizons, we postulate that the causal events were mainly phreatomagmatic eruptions.

'Pyroclastic density currents were probably responsible for the major causalities and for transporting the bulk of the terrestrial vertebrates from different habitats, such as lizards, birds, non-avian dinosaurs and mammals, into lacustrine environments for burial.

'Terrestrial vertebrate carcasses transported by and sealed within the pyroclastic flows were clearly preserved as exceptional fossils through this process.'

Though famous fish fossils have emerged from the region, only terrestrial fossils — birds, lizards, mammals — showed marks of transport by these volcanic pyroclastic flows, the team say.

Fresh, hot, dry, acid volcanic ash promoted burning, charring or mummifying of soft tissues, which, as a result, became more resistant to decay and better preserved.

Experts say the site is similar to the effect of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79 buried Pompeii, Herculaneum and other cities, entombing people and animals in suspended death poses. Here, the British Museum shows off artefacts from Pompeii.
