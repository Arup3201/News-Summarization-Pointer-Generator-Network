This is the heartwarming moment a mother surprised her five-year-old daughter after she returned from a six-month overseas deployment with the Navy.

Catherine Kelly, who has just returned from being stationed in Bahrain, showed up at Concordia Christian Day School in Conover, North Carolina, while her little girl Brianna was posing for a class picture.

The youngster had no idea she had planned the homecoming, and her face lit up as soon as she walked in. 

Brianna then ran past her classmates and into her mother's arms. 

Before she walked in Kelly told WSOC-TV: 'It's been rough, being away from your family members, especially your kids. (You've) got to think that you do this for your family and it's your job.'

Brianna has been staying with Kelly's brother and sister-in-law while she has been away. 

They arranged the emotional meeting and were there with other members of Brianna's family, including her father.  

Sister-in-law Angie Kelly told the station: '(I'm) so proud of Bri for being such a big girl through all this. She has really been a wonderful little grownup, almost, through this. She's handled it well.'  

Surprise: Brianna Kelly's face lights up when she notices her mother Catherine walking into the Concordia Christian Day School in Conover, North Carolina

Embrace: The five-year-old girl runs into her mother's arms. The pair haven't seen each other for six months as she was deployed with the Navy in Bahrain 

Happy: Brianna has been staying with Kelly's brother and sister-in-law while she has been away. The couple organized the emotional meeting

Difficult: Kelly admitted being away from her family has been 'rough' before she walked in and admitted she was nervous
