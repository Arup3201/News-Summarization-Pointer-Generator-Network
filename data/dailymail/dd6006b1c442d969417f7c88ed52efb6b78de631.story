Attack: Jason McPartland was convicted of assault on national television but claimed that staff of The Jeremy Kyle Show goaded him

A guest on The Jeremy Kyle show was ‘goaded’ by production staff into punching a relative’s ex-boyfriend in front of a baying audience, a court was told.

Jason McPartland, 41, strode on stage and hit Darren Price in the face before telling him: ‘Shut up before you get another slap.’

It is the latest incident to shame the ITV1 programme, previously branded ‘a form of human bear baiting’ by a judge.

The show, which was never broadcast, was on the theme ‘You can’t stop me  seeing our children just because you hate my new girlfriend!’

McPartland is the uncle of Mr Price’s former girlfriend, who was also on stage. Magistrates heard that he had been deliberately wound up by production staff before being brought on.

The court was also told that they tried to dissuade Mr Price from reporting the attack to police.

McPartland, of Birmingham, admitted assault and was given a six-month community order with supervision.

He had been a supporting guest at the filming at Granada Studios in Manchester last July for his niece, Helen McPartland.

She was there to discuss relationship problems with Mr Price. In a clip shown to the court, presenter Kyle asks her: ‘Who’s Jason?’ to which she responds: ‘My uncle.’

Upset: McPartland said staff had been saying back stage that the victim, Mr Price, had been calling him names

Kyle then calls out: ‘Let’s get Jason
on the Jeremy Kyle show!’ at which the tattooed, shaven-headed guest 
strides on stage to yells and whoops from the studio audience.

McPartland immediately attacks Mr Price before being grabbed by security guards.

Following the blow – obscured in the 
footage – Kyle tells him to sit down, saying: ‘You’ll not be on this 
stage if you ever do anything like that again.’

Controversial: ITV today denied their staff had 'goaded' the guest before he lashed out

McPartland says on camera: ‘Yes, I 
have just hit him,’ adding: ‘Shut up before you get another slap.’ Clare
Byers, prosecuting, said Mr Price had warned show staff beforehand that
he believed McPartland to be a violent man.

After filming had finished, he told staff he wanted the police to be called, she added.

‘They said to “leave the police for 
now and that your main concern is the kids”,’ she said. ‘Aftercare 
advised not to contact the police.’

But Mr Price, who suffered reddening 
and soreness, reported the incident when he returned home to Margate, 
Kent. Gina Clayton, defending, said McPartland would not have committed 
the assault if he had not been egged on by staff.

‘He was told that the complainant had
been calling him names,’ she said. ‘He was provoked by staff to the 
point that when he came on stage, he was particularly angry.

‘He was wound up by Jeremy Kyle staff in order to provoke a specific reaction.’

Miss McPartland and Mr Price had previously lived together and rowed over debts, Manchester City Magistrates’ Court heard.

McPartland was also said to have been upset at comments Mr Price made about his late father on the show.

Incident: A judge called the Kyle show a 'human form of bear baiting' when David Staniforth headbutted bus driver Larry Mahoney, leaving him with blood pouring from his nose

Magistrate Vanessa Goldstone said she accepted he had been goaded but that was no excuse.

‘On the one hand, we see that you were provoked by the show but you should have had the ability to control yourself,’ she said.

‘It is never acceptable to punch another person regardless of the history and the goading.
‘We see there was a lot of goading on The Jeremy Kyle Show.’

McPartland, who had no previous convictions, was also ordered to pay £50 compensation.

After the hearing, an ITV spokesman said: ‘The Jeremy Kyle Show does not show violence and  neither does it condone it.’

She denied there was any goading or that staff advised against reporting the assault to police.
In 2007, District Judge Alan Berg said the show was ‘a form of human bear baiting’ aimed at  titillating bored viewers. 
He spoke out after hearing how David 
Staniforth, 45, butted Larry Mahoney, a lodger who had an affair with 
his wife, at the studios.

In 2009, Judge Sean Enright said the 
programme exploited ‘foolish and gullible’ people as he jailed Jamie 
Juste, 26, for attacking his girlfriend Rebecca Langley after an episode
on her alleged infidelity was shown.
