A mother who received a bereavement note from Gordon Brown following the death of her soldier son has fallen victim to vile internet trolls.

Jacqui Janes received the hand-written note from the then-Prime Minister sent her after her son was killed in Afghanistan in 2009.

Cruel web bullies have bombarded Jacqui with hate mail after she wrote a note on Facebook urging demonstrators not to protest at war memorials.

Her message was posted on the official
page of a planned nationwide demonstration against the Government's 
proposed defence cuts.

Tearful Jacqui said: 'People started telling me I was lying about being Jamieâ€™s mother.

'They said I did not care about 
soldiers dying in Afghanistan and that I was insulting my son's memory. I
was in tears because I was so hurt and angry.

'I am against the cuts, but I also 
think war memorials should be respected as a place for the fallen, not 
for making political statements.

'I know Jamie would not want people demonstrating on war memorials.'

The abusive messages sent to Jacqui 
have been condemned by organisers of the demonstrations which will take 
place at war memorials across the UK next week.

Organiser Dee Edwards said: 'It was 
brought to my attention people are abusing Jacqui so I posted a clear 
message to everyone saying this would not be tolerated.

'I do believe the protest is the right
thing to do. I have spoken to people who lost their sons in wars and 
they are all behind the idea.'

Guardsman Janes, of 1st Battalion The Grenadier Guards, lost his arms and legs when an improvised
bomb exploded while he was on foot patrol in Afghanistan.

Fellow soldiers stretchered him away while coming under heavy fire from Taliban fighter, but he later died.

An inquest into his death in May 2010 heard that Guardsman Janes was part of a 30-strong
foot patrol moving towards a Taliban-controlled village in Helmand
province when the device exploded.

He was using a metal detector to locate hidden bombs, having been chosen for the task because of his skill and courage.
