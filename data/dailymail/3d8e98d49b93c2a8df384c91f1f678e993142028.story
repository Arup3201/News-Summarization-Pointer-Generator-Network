There was renewed speculation over Vladimir Putin's love life last night after TV footage showed his rumoured girlfriend wearing a 'wedding ring'.

As the Russian President was hosting the Winter Olympics in Sochi, glamorous champion gymnast Alina Kabayeva, 30, was at a children’s sporting event in the industrial city of Nizhnekamsk, where she showed her ring finger to TV camera crews, prompting a flurry of internet comments.

Putin, 61, was also shown wearing a wedding ring during a meeting with the Egyptian defence minister last week, before a Kremlin-friendly news website withdrew the picture saying it predated last June’s announcement that he and his wife Lyudmila were to divorce.

The Kremlin has previously denied claims President Putin married Miss Kabayeva in the town of Valdai in September

At the time Alexei Navalny, Putin’s most charismatic political rival, tweeted: ‘I’m told that Putin and Kabayeva are marrying today at the Iver Monastery. All of Valdai sealed off.’

However, Mr Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later dismissed the claims as ‘an internet exercise to relieve boredom’.

Valdai is in the Novgorod region, where 60-year-old Putin was based in September for an international conference involving politicians and journalists.

The Kremlin were forced to deny that Putin had tied the knot with Miss Kabayeva in the town of Valdai in September, late last year

Speculation of the pair's union was rife after Alexei Navalny, Putin’s most charismatic political rival, tweeted: ‘I’m told that Putin and Kabayeva are marrying today at the Iver Monastery. All of Valdai sealed off’

Putins aides have repeatedly denied he is involved in a relationship with the gold medal-winning gymnast, 30, pictured. Claims that the pair have children together have also been dismissed

His aides have repeatedly denied he is involved in a relationship with the gold medal-winning gymnast. 

Claims that the pair have children together have also been dismissed.

This week the former KGB man indicated he may stand for office again in 2018.

Putin was first elected in 2000 and served two four year terms until he handed control of the country to puppet president Dmitry Medvedev who served until 2012 when Putin was reelected, this time for a six-year term.

If reelected the hardline ruler will have been in power for nearly a quarter of a century which will make him the nation's longest-serving leader since Joseph Stalin.

Putin stepped out of the presidential limelight and became prime minister in 2008 to observe a limit of two consecutive terms.

However, he maintained his grip on power from the shadows with his longtime ally, Dmitry Medvedev, serving as a placeholder.
