One of the two men involved in a Good Friday shooting spree which left three dead and two injured has denied he was motivated by racism.

Jake England has been accused of a hate crime for his role in the Tulsa killings alongside his roommate Alvin Watts, which came just a day after he posted a racially charged message on Facebook.

However, in an interview from his cell he has insisted he is not racist, and even said that some of his 'best friends' are African-American.

The 19-year-old also spoke of the torment of witnessing the death of his father, who was killed during an attempted burglary, and his girlfriend, who shot herself at their home.

Accused: Alvin Watts, right, and England have confessed to a murderous shooting spree on Good Friday

England and Watts, 32, have confessed to shooting five black men on the evening of April 6, killing three and sending two more to hospital.

They drove around the city in a white pick-up truck, attacking their victims after asking them for directions.

On Sunday, police followed the pair from the house they shared and arrested them, providing relief for African-American residents of Tulsa who had been terrified by the prospect of a killer on the loose.

In an interview with his lawyer, Clark Brewster, England said that he was not a racist, and added that growing up on the city's majority-black north side had enabled him to make friends with people of all races.

Tirade: The day before the Good Friday shootings, Jake England railed against the 'f****** n*****' who shot and killed his father Carl England

When asked if he harboured any 'ill will' towards African-Americans, he replied: 'Always have gotten along. Didn't matter what colour they were,' according to footage of the interview posted on KOTV.

He added: 'The line of work that I was in and the place I worked, we always got along with everybody.'

And when asked by Mr Brewster whether it was correct that he had 'African-Americans that you count among your best friends', England - who has Cherokee heritage - said that it was.

The day before the Good Friday shootings, England posted a message on Facebook saying: 'Today is two years that my dad has been gone shot by a f****** n*****'.

But he told his lawyer: 'It was to express the way I was upset over the guy that shot my dad. But that's the only time I've ever expressed anything like that about somebody.'

England also used the interview to describe his troubled upbringing by a mother who has been in prison for over a decade and a father killed in 2010.

Soon after his father's death, the teenager became responsible for bringing up his sister Katie, now 16, who was 'a little much for [other relatives] to handle'.

He was in a two-year relationship with girlfriend Sheran, and the couple had a baby son, Jacob Jr, born in October last year.

But in January, she shot herself in front of him and one of her other children.

England told Mr Brewer that he had been disturbed by the violent incident, and said: 'I got medication to help me overcome bad thoughts, I guess.'

He wrote on Facebook that 'it's hard not to go off', and said that he was 'gone in the head'.

The three men who died in England and Watts's rampage have been named as Dannaer Fields, 49, Bobby Clark, 54, and William Allen, 31.

The two men wounded in the attacks, David Hall, 46, and Deon Tucker, 44, have since been released from hospital.
