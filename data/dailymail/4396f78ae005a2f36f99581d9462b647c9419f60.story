Murdered: Steven Langley was gunned down on Friday in Tonge, Kent

Police have charged a man with murder after a fisheries owner was shot dead on Friday.

Steven Langley, 56, was gunned down not far from Bax Farm fisheries in Tonge, Kent, which he owned.

Parademics rushed to the scene, but Mr Langley was pronounced dead at the scene, having sustained wounds to the abdomen.

Simon Olsen, 54, was arrested by Kent Police shortly after the attack on Friday afternoon, who later charged him with the murder. He remains in police custody.

The 
man, who is believed to have once worked at the fisheries, is being 
questioned by officers.

Police are not looking for anybody else in connection with the death.

Mr Langley, described as a 'gentle giant', worked as a firefighter at Kent Fire and
 Rescue Service for 22 years and yesterday friends and colleagues paid 
tribute on social media.

The victim's wife, Lucia Langley, paid tribute today to her husband, saying: 'He was a gentle giant with a heart of gold. He loved 
his family who always came first and he would do anything for anybody.'

Friends and colleagues also paid tribute to the father and husband, saying he will be 'greatly missed'.

Jim Green, from Sittingbourne, Kent, 
who had worked with Mr Langley, said: 'It is with great sadness to hear 
of the death of Steve, especially in such horrific circumstances.

'He
 was a great colleague and someone who I am glad to have called a true 
friend. He will be greatly missed by all that knew him.'

Another friend posted on the GoFishing website: 'I am posting here news of a great mate's tragic death. Steve Langley, owner of Bax Farm Fishery Kent, was [killed] on site.

Shot: The victim was found near Bax Farm and Fishery near Sittingbourne, Kent. A man, 54, is being held

'I had known Steve for many years: a great angling ambassador, stalwart and friend.

'We had fished together, drank together and worked together. I am 
heartbroken but my love, my thoughts, my peace and my prayers are with 
Steve's family and many friends, especially his old mates with whom he 
served in Kent Fire and Rescue.'

Detective Inspector Gavin Moss, of the 
Serious Crime Directorate said: 'Mr Langley was a much loved father and husband and was also a well known member of his local community.

'We are continuing to investigate the circumstances that have led to this tragic death.'
