Being on the TV doesn't stop you getting star-struck and right now I've got a serious girl crush on Cheryl Cole. Or should I say Cheryl Fernandez-Versini.

Now that newly-wed C F-V is back on our celebrity radars, I've remembered how gorgeous and glossy she always looks, and being a fellow brunette, she's a great beauty inspiration for me.

So this week I'm recreating one of Cheryl's signature looks - all sultry eyes, glowing skin and pale lips.

GET THE LOOK

THE BASE

Cheryl is lucky enough to have flawless skin, so for this look I've used DiorSkin Forever Foundation to create a smooth, even canvas for the rest of my make-up.

I prefer to apply my foundation with my fingertips, but a sponge or foundation brush creates an equally professional finish. Now dust over your base with translucent powder to fix it in place - I've chosen the super-sheer Daniel Sandler Invisible Veil Powder, blending it in with a big, fluffy brush.

THE EYES

I've already prepped my eyes with foundation and powder, so I'm not using an eye primer but going straight on to eye colour.

First up I've chosen bareMinerals High Shine Eye Colour in Bronzed. This beautiful sparkly rose-gold eyeshadow comes in a tube with a handy sponge at the end, so it's easy to apply exactly where you want it.

Draw the colour along your upper lash line then use your fingertips to blend over your entire eye socket. You can really pack on this shade to create a shimmering, starry finish.Cheryl loves dark black liner so I'm making that the focus of this look.

Begin by drawing a black eyeliner pencil along your top and bottom lashes, getting as close to the lash line as possible. I've used Daniel Sandler's Black Velvet Eyeliner, which is waterproof so less likely to smudge.

If you find it tricky to draw a single line, it may be easier to apply your liner in tiny strokes - the finished effect looks just as good. Now draw the liner along your waterline.

Finish up with lashings of Guerlain Maxi Lash Mascara to recreate Cheryl's signature sooty lashes, wiggling the mascara brush right into the roots and along to the tips to ensure a really full coverage.

THE GLOW

Paparazzi flashes can really bleach out your skintone in photos, so Cheryl looks her best with a warm, glowing complexion. I'm recreating her sun-kissed look using Clarins Bronzing Duo compact.

Simply swish a fluffy brush across the bronzing powder and swirl it over your cheekbones, neck, forehead and nose. I've added blusher into the mix to give my cheeks a soft, warm flush.

Daniel Sandler's Watercolour Creme Rouge Blusher in Soft Pink is easy to apply with your fingers - just dab it onto the apples of your cheeks and gently blend it in.

THE LIPS

Since this look is all about the eyes, I've kept to a simple, neutral lip by dabbing a touch of the same Daniel Sandler blusher onto my lips.

Here are Binky's beauty picks for achieving Cheryl's look

Matching your cheeks and lips a great way of creating a naturally pretty look - it's easy to achieve, and this Watercolour Creme Rouge is soft and moisturising enough not to dry out your pout.

THE BROWS

Cheryl knows strong brows really frame your face, so she always keeps hers well-groomed. I've used the brilliant Clarins Pro Palette Eyebrow Kit, starting with a brow wax to fix stray hairs in place. Next I've used the mid-brown brow colour to define my eyebrow shape. It's well worth the effort as your brows will look shapely and stunning.

So there you have it: Binky does Cheryl! This really is an incredibly simple beauty look to do, but the effect is exceptionally glamorous. And if there's one thing Cheryl and I agree on, it's that glamour rules!

Stay gorgeous
