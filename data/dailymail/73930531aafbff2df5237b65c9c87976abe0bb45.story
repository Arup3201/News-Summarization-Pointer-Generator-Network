Cycling enthusiasts might usually opt for the model with go-faster stripes or an extra set of gears.

But this new French-designed bike gives customers a unique choice of customisation - it can be made from seven different types of wood.

The WOOD.b is made from a hybrid of wood and steel by Strasbourg-based company BSG.

The manufacturers said the bike is designed with everyday use in mind and can be easily repaired if needed

Customers can choose from seven different types of wood from mahogany to ash or rosewood

The beautiful design makes the bike as much a work of art as a practical asset

The vintage-style design is the brainchild of Thierry Boltz and Claude Solz as an urban bicycle with a difference.

The wooden frame and handlebars can be made from mahogany, dark oak, beech, walnut, chestnut, ash or rosewood.

Using wood to make bikes has become something of a trend in recent years.

Many bicycle manufacturers have recently begun ignoring metal to use cardboard, bamboo, and even plywood to build bike frames.

Another company based in Denver, in the US, recently released a new model called the 'Wood Scorcher' - with a wooden frame which is steam bent into shape.

It is not known how much WOOD.b will 
cost when it begins taking orders in September but the Wood Scorcher 
cost between $3,500 - $4,000 depending on the model.

The WOOD.b goes into production in September but it is not known how much it will cost

BSG say the bikes are made to European standards and are easily-maintained
