He then asked his colleague, fellow drilling engineer Andrew Rowe if he could use his. 

Moments later Mr Rowe heard screams and allegedly saw sparks coming from the hose which was lying across Mr Osborne's body.

Another colleague came to help and Mr Osborne was taken into the corridor to be resuscitated but he died. 

His body was taken to Effia Nkwanta Regional Hospital morgue in Sekondi where an autopsy was to take place. 

According to the officer, police have launched a full-scale investigation into the case.

Mr Osborne was an engineer for Fugro Seacore, a marine drilling company, based in Falmouth.

Managing director, Bob Jenkins, told the BBC that it was a tragic accident adding: 'Out of respect for Alex's parents, I am not in a position to comment further at this stage.'

Fugro Seacore is a marine drilling company, providing geotechnical and specialist services for marine construction, renewable energy, oil, gas and mining industries in the UK and around the world.
