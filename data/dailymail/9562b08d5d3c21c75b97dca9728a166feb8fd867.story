Jennifer Efre DeBerry, 30 has been arrested for allegedly having sex with a teenage student

A married dance teacher has been accused of having a four-month sexual relationship with a 15-year-old student.

Jennifer Efre DeBerry, 30, allegedly struck up the relationship with the teen after meeting him at Dance Effect Studio in Coral Springs, Florida, where she is an instructor and manager, and they allegedly exchanged hundreds of texts and Facebook messages detailing their affair.

'Oh my love its so amazing that today was
so incredible for you,' she wrote in one message, according to a police report.

'It really was very incredible for me too <3
It was so perfect and amazing and making love with you was just the 
greatest feeling in the whole world <3 :D XOXO.'

DeBerry and the boy allegedly continued the relationship from September last year until January.

He allegedly told police that he was 13 when he met DeBerry at the Dance Effect Studio but that they began the sexual relationship when he turned 15, NBC Miami reported.

In their last encounter on January 26 this year, 
DeBerry and the boy spent five hours alone together at his home, according to the complaint affidavit.

'I hope one day I will be their 
daughter-in-law,' she allegedly wrote in one. 'I can't believe how I want to spend the rest of my life
with you and I'm sure of it <3 I love you more than anything and I 
have loved you for a long time.'

Department spokeswoman Sgt. Carla Kmiotek added that messages were also exchanged on Facebook and that Deberry communicated like a teenager in many of them.

'There's a lot of cell phone and text message evidence and also on Facebook that it was very evident they were involved in some kind of relationship,' she said.
