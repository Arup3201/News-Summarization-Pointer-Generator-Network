For millions of workers, lunchtime is the highlight of their day, which is otherwise marred by monotony, irritation or stress.

But a study, published yesterday, reveals the crippling cost of buying lunch every day, rather than making your own packed lunch.

It warns many workers are spending ‘more cash than they realise on items such as takeaway coffees and gourmet sandwiches.’

Bringing in your own packed lunch could save you thousands, as research shows people spend around £90,000 in a lifetime

On average, it estimates the average worker spends nearly £90,000 during their working life buying lunch, as well as cups of tea or coffee and occasional afternoon snacks.

For those workers with an expensive coffee habit, the cost can be huge. At Costa, a medium-sized cappuccino costs £2.45.

This is the equivalent of a worker, who earns the average full-time salary of £26,000, spending more than three years’ of their earnings on their lunch.

Workers could pay off a £100,000 mortgage about six years early if they put the money towards making over-payments on their loan, rather than buying lunch and other snacks.

On average, the poll, from the office search firm, Officebroker.com, found the typical worker spends £7.81 a day on their lunch, drinks and other work-time snacks.

But those who bring in their own packed lunch and snacks as well as making their own tea and coffee spend an average of just £1.50 a day.

One London-based worker told researchers: ‘I usually get through about a tenner a day on things like coffees and sandwiches from Pret a Manger.

Eating out at lunchtime might be a treat, but it can rack up bills pretty quickly for those who like to splash their cash

‘I’m also fond of fresh fruit and bottles of sparkling water. I might also pick up a biscuit a couple of times each week.

‘It does all add up but I’m happy to pay for the convenience. I’m just not the sort of person who would be making my own lunch the night before at home.’

The impact over a working life lasting 47 years is eye-watering, particularly when some workers said they spend as much as £30 a day. The lowest daily spend was £3.

It estimates the total bill will reach £88,971 - and will be even higher for those who buy drinks not just for themselves, but their colleagues, during the working day.

To make matters worse, researchers did not adjust the figure for the rising cost of living, which will inevitably make a worker’s favourite sandwich, pasty or soup even more expensive.

Marks & Spencer said its best-selling sandwich is the prawn mayonnaise on oatmeal bread which costs £1.90.

It has been its most popular sandwich since the sandwich was launched in 1982, although it is occasionally beaten by the £2.75 BLT sandwich.

At Pret a Manger, which has opened 254 branches since its launch in 1986, the most popular option is the tuna baguette which costs £2.99.

The other two in the top three are the £3.65 chicken Caesar and bacon on artisan bread and the £3.25 ‘posh’ cheddar and pickle on artisan bread.

Pret said the average customer spends £4.55 on their lunch in one of its branches, which comprises of two different items, such as a sandwich and a bag of crisps.

The study comes at a time when workers are suffering an unprecedented squeeze on their finances, according to the Office for National Statistics.

Millions of workers are paid less than they were a decade ago, if their pay is adjusted for the impact of inflation.

Since 2009, the ONS’s analysis shows the pay rise given to the average worker has been consistently below the rate of inflation.

For example, the average pay rise given to both public and private sector workers is currently a paltry 1.3 per cent, but the cost of living is rising at 2.7 per cent.
