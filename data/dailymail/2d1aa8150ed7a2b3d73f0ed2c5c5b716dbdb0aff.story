Allegations: John Terry's father Ted, 59, (pictured) is accused of headbutting an Asian man, and threatening a black station cleaner with a bottle

The father of Chelsea captain John Terry threatened a train station cleaner with a bottle and told him 'I will smash it over your head you black c***', a court heard today.

Ted Terry, 59, is accused of headbutting and racially abusing an Asian man in a drunken row over a cigarette, allegedly calling Amarjit Talafair a 'f****** Paki' outside a pub.

Terry, who was wearing a West Ham top at the time, then went on to Fenchurch Street Station and allegedly threatened cleaner Bakela Masuila with a bottle, while hurling racist abuse at him.

The Old Bailey heard that Terry and his friends Tudor Musteata, a
 47-year-old Russian, and, 36, had been drinking for 
several hours before the confrontation.

At
 around 8pm on March 22, last year they approached Mr Talafair as he smoked a 
cigarette outside the Windsor Pub near the station in central 
London.

Alexander Chalk, prosecuting, said: 'Edward Terry was wearing a dark blue jacket with the insignia of West Ham Football Club. One of them approached and asked for a cigarette.

'Mr Talafair said he didn't have any cigarettes.'

The Old Bailey was told that when Mr Talafair walked away Terry's group started shouting: 'f****** Paki, f****** Paki, come here.'

Terry then approached Mr Talafair and said: 'You f****** Paki, let's have it right here and now.'

'The confrontation culminated in Edward Terry approaching Mr Talafair and headbutting him, striking him above the nose,' said Mr Chalk.

'It is alleged the group were hostile, aggressive and abusive.'

The court was told that Mr Talafair then went back to his friends in the pub and Terry's group walked off towards Fenchurch Street Station.

Group: Terry, and co-defendant Stephen Niland (right), 36, had been drinking for several hours before the confrontation with Amarjit Talafair, the court heard

Accused: The Old Bailey was told that when Mr Talafair walked away Terry's group started shouting: 'F****** Paki, f****** Paki, come here'

At the station the group threatened a black cleaner, a train dispatcher and several other witnesses, it is claimed.

Terry allegedly threatened to smash a bottle over the head of the cleaner saying 'I will smash it over your head you black c***".'

He also threatened to headbutt a train dispatcher, the court heard.

Dispute: The court heard that Tudor Musteata (pictured) approached one of Mr Talafair's friends and pushed away a witness who tried to get in between them

Russian-born Musteata then approached one of Mr Talafair's friends and pushed away a witness who tried to get in between them, the court heard.

'It seemed like he and the other males wanted to fight,' said Mr Chalk.

Prominent: The court was told that Terry, whose son is Chelsea captain John, is the father of a prominent footballer

The court heard that no charges had been brought in relation to the incident involving Mr Mansuila, who is known as 'Bax'.

When interviewed by police on March 28, Terry admitted that he started a confrontation and had been 'acting the goat'.

At one point during the confrontation, he claimed, he was approached by a man carrying a bottle.

Believing himself to be in danger, he disarmed the male and then pressed his head against the man's forehead before leaving with Niland.

Following his arrest Terry admitted having a confrontation with someone he referred to as 'half caste', the court heard.

Mr Chalk told the jury of seven men and five women: 'He thought he had initiated the confrontation by doing something stupid, or as he put it, acting the goat, but couldn't recall the details.'

Terry claimed he saw the alleged victim approaching with a bottle and believed he was under threat, the court heard.

He claimed disarmed Mr Talafair and 'pressed his head' towards the alleged victim's forehead.

'He denied using racist language,' said Mr Chalk.

Terry then went on to Fenchurch Street Station (pictured) and allegedly threatened cleaner Bakela Masuila

'He said he did hear racist remarks but declined to say who had uttered them.'

Interviewed last April, Niland and Musteata said there had been an altercation but denied using or hearing racist language.

The prosecutor began his opening by telling jurors: 'This case is about racist threats, racist abuse and ultimately racist violence directed towards a member of the public who happened to be Asian.'

He added: 'Edward Terry uses Fenchurch Street station regularly and is well-known to station staff as the father of a prominent footballer.'

Terry, Grays, Essex, denies racially aggravated common assault and racially aggravated fear or provocation of violence.

Niland, of Romford, Essex, and Musteata, of Greenwich, southeast London, deny racially aggravated fear or provocation of violence.

The trial continues.
