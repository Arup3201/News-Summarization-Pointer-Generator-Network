Cleared: Ben Sullivan has called for the right of anonymity for those accused of rape

The president of the Oxford Union cleared of rape allegations has called for the right of anonymity for those accused of similar claims. 

Ben Sullivan, a third year university student, was on bail for six weeks after he was arrested over claims he raped one fellow student and attacked another.

But on Wednesday, police informed the 21-year-old that no further action would be taken against him following an investigation.

Last night, he said those accused of rape should have the right to anonymity until initial investigations had been carried out by police. 

Mr Sullivan also revealed he had struggled to deal with the fallout from the ‘poisonous allegations’.

Speaking about his ‘harrowing’ experience on Newsnight, he said: ‘I’m not of the extremist [sort] who don’t think you should have your identity revealed until you’ve been convicted, or even necessarily after being charged. 

‘What I don’t agree with though is that everyone’s identity is automatically revealed the minute they are arrested.

‘I think there should be some sort of happy medium whereby your identity is protected initially, until at least the conclusion of a preliminary investigation.’

Asked whether alleged rapists should be given anonymity but not those accused of other offences, he said: ‘That is completely true and why I would never say that everyone’s identity in the circumstances should be kept secret.

‘I’m completely aware that it can be extremely useful to police investigations for people’s identities to be revealed for people to come forward.

‘However, these are obviously incredibly poisonous allegations, they are incredibly difficult to deal with.’

Mr Sullivan’s arrest rocked the prestigious 200-year-old debating society, where many political leaders have cut their teeth.

His arrest sparked a period of turmoil for the society as a boycott campaign from fellow students saw a host of high-profile speakers cancel their appearances.

Speaking of the ordeal, he said: ‘It’s been very difficult, very harrowing. It puts things in perspective, changes your priorities to say the very least. I’m very thankful to everyone who has given me support - my friends, my family, and people at the union.’

A letter written by student politicians to around 30 speakers who had been booked to attend, asked them to boycott the Union, and Mr Sullivan to resign in what they called a ‘push for equality’.

Nobel Peace prize winner Tawakkol Karman, a human rights activist, Interpol secretary-general Robert Noble, the US entrepreneur Julie Meyer and David Mepham, the UK director of Human Rights Watch, were all said to have pulled out of debates at the Oxford Union, citing concerns about Mr Sullivan’s arrest. 

But the banker’s son, who attended £22,000-a-year St Paul’s school in London, repeatedly defied calls to stand down as president while the police investigation was carried out.

Student union official Sarah Pine who was the leader of the campaign to boycott the union also appeared on Newsnight and said she stood by the campaign.

Mr Sullivan said: ‘I don’t doubt the organisers of the boycott have very good intentions and I do agree that sexual violence is a very serious problem at Oxford and other universities.’
