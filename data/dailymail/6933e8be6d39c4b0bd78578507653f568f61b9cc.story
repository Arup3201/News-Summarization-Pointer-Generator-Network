More than 66,000 families with more five or more children rely on jobless benefits, it emerged today.

One in five of the households receives Jobseekers' Allowance while more than one in 10 is paid income support.

However the total amount of money the large families can receive is now being limited to £26,000, as ministers come under pressure to cut the benefits cap by as much as a third.

Welfare: New figures reveal the raft of benefits claimed by families with five or more children

New figures reveal that in May 2012 there were 66,580 families with five or more children receiving out-of-work benefits.

Of these, 13,670 were paid Jobseekers' Allowance, 7,900 received Incapacity Benefit or Severe Disablement Allowance and 41,580 were paid Income Support, received by people working fewer than 16 hours a week. Some 9,110 households also received Employment and Support Allowance while Pension Credit was also paid to 600 homes.

Some households will receive more than one of these benefits.

Figures released last week show that almost 10,000 families with five or more children had been hit by the £26,000 benefit cap.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: ‘Capping benefit at average earnings is forecast, by reducing the large benefit amounts previously paid to households, to save £85 million this year and around £140 million next year.

‘What is more, some 19,000 potentially capped claimants have moved into work, where paying tax and national insurance contributions brings a further benefit to the Exchequer.’

The cap affects income from the main out-of-work benefits including Jobseeker’s Allowance, Income Support, Employment and Support Allowance, Universal Credit and other benefits such as Housing Benefit, Child Benefit and Child Tax Credit and Carer’s Allowance.

However, households are exempt from the cap if someone living their receives one of a number of other benefits such as Disability Living Allowance, Personal Independence Payment, Industrial Injuries Benefit and the War Disablement Pension.

Mr Duncan Smith came under pressure yesterday from Tory MPs to cut the benefit cap from £26,000 to as little as £18,000.

In the Commons he insisted the policy is ‘under review’ and is backed by three in four members of the public.

The coalition’s decision to cap the total amount of income a family can receive in benefits has proved to be one of the most popular policies ever devised.

The government set the maximum amount that a household can receive in benefits at £26,000 – the median average annual income of a working family.

It means couples, with or without children, can claim up to £500-a-week while a single adult without children can receive £350-a-week in benefits.

But many Tory MPs have argued it is still equivalent to the take-home pay of someone earning £35,000.

Tory MP Andrew Bridgen complained it was much higher than the median average £22,130 annual salary in his North West Leicestershire constituency, giving most workers take home pay of only £17,800.

Last week it emerged that since the cap’s introduction in April last year, 33,000 families had had their benefits curbed.

It included 150 who received more than the take-home pay of someone on a salary of £65,000-a-year.

In the Commons Mr Bridgen said his constituents were astonished by the figures.

He urged Mr Duncan Smith to ‘persevere with this policy of a benefits cap and also review the level at which the cap, which is currently considerably more than the average post tax income in my constituency’.

Reducing the cap to £20,000 would be the equivalent to take home pay of someone in work on a salary of around £25,000.
