Manchester United's first team squad got an early train from Stockport on Friday evening as they geared up for their trip to London to face QPR on Saturday afternoon.

Louis van Gaal's side are looking to bounce back after their 1-0 loss to Southampton at Old Trafford last Sunday.

United failed to record a single shot on target as their 10-match unbeaten league run was ended by the Saints.

Robin van Persie has a slim chance of playing against QPR after Van Gaal revealed the United striker only suffered a 'minor' ankle injury in last Sunday's defeat.

If Van Persie is ruled out, either Radamel Falcao or James Wilson is likely to come into the starting XI with Van Gaal insisting that the former Monaco striker still needs to prove himself at Manchester United.

The £6million loan signing has dropped out of favour and was understood to have been unhappy with missing out on the defeat to Southampton.

Speaking before United's trip to QPR, Van Gaal said: 'He has to prove himself. We have made a deal and everything is clear. It's not the end of the year so he has a chance.'

'If a player cost £95m or £5,000 it's not any different for me. You have to prove yourself.'

Van Gaal declined to comment on QPR's survival chances ahead of Saturday's game. 

'Im not busy with relegation,' he said. 'I'm not busy with that problem. I am busy looking up and not looking down.'

He also reiterated that United's target is a top-four spot.

'Champions League is our goal,' he said. 'Of course we want to be champion but you have to win matches at Southampton or Aston Villa away. When you are not doing that you cannot be champions. Our goal is within the first four because we want to play Champions League.'

Meanwhile, QPR midfielder Niko Kranjcar has recovered from thigh trouble and could feature against United but Armand Traore will miss out with a toe problem and joins Sandro and Yun Suk-Young on the sidelines.
