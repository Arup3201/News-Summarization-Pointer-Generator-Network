A man receiving hospital treatment for anthrax may have contracted the disease from contaminated heroin.

The unnamed drug addict, from Gwynedd, Wales is the latest anthrax case involving users in Blackpool and Scotland.

Public Health Wales said it was not yet clear whether the cases are linked but confirmed that there is an ‘ongoing outbreak’ among intravenous drug users in Europe and warned there may be more cases to come.

Outbreak: Eight cases of anthrax have been identified amongst intravenous drug users in the past three months

The man, who is undergoing treatment at a hospital in the north east of England, is the eight case to be have been identified since early June, with contaminated heroin the suspected source.

Last month it was reported that a drug user had died in a Lancashire hospital after being infected with anthrax.

Dr Chris Whiteside, consultant in communicable disease control for Public Health Wales, said: ‘It’s likely further cases among people who inject drugs will be identified as part of the on-going outbreak in EU countries.

‘The Department of Health has alerted the NHS of the possibility of drug users presenting to emergency departments and walk-in clinics, with symptoms suggestive of anthrax.’

A spokeswoman for Public Health Wales said: ‘Anthrax in drug users was considered to be very rare.

“Before the 2009-2010 outbreak in Scotland, only one previous case had been reported, in Norway in 2000.’

Dr Whiteside added that although anthrax was a very serious disease, it can be treated with antibiotics, especially if cases were identified early.

Humans can become infected with anthrax through the skin, inhalation, injection or ingestion of anthrax spores and symptoms can vary depending on the route of infection.

Drug users may become infected when heroin is contaminated with anthrax spores, however the drug is taken.

The man at the centre of the latest outbreak is said to be responding to treatment well and is in a stable condition.
