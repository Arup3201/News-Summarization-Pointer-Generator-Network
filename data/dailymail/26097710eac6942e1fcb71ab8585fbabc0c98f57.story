The 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO is one of the world's most desirable cars.

Collectors pay up to £30 million to own one. Now avid car fans can now purchase their own for one-thousandth the price of the real thing, but it is four times smaller.

Luxury stone specialists Lapicida, based in Yorkshire, have created a one-off version of the iconic vehicle. But unlike the Ferrari, which is capable of driving at 173mph, this model GTO will be going nowhere fast - as it has been made completely from marble.

It
 took staff more than 100 hours to cave the intricate sculpture, with 
the model crafted out of a single block of Arabescato Italian marble.

The unique 1.2-metre long creation was designed using state-of-the-art 3D scanning and advanced 3DMAX software.

It was unveiled this week by the firm, which is selling the automotive ornament for £30,000.

Jason Cherrington, boss of Lapicida, said: 'We made the Ferrari 250 GTO in marble to demonstrate our unique capabilities. It is a testament to our craftsmens' skills and now occupies pole position in our London showroom window.'
