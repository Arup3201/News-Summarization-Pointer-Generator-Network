Tulane quarterback Nick Montana was in a tight spot Saturday with no timeouts and the clock running out on fourth down, but would his dad have approved of his solution?

Montana, son of football legend Joe Montana, got his share of criticism after deciding to spike the ball in Saturday's game.

The decision came at the end of a lackluster game against Central Florida, throwing for 147 yards and two interceptions on the way to a 20-13 loss.

Sports reporters thought the son of Joe Montana would know better than to shame the family legacy

'There are certain things, like spiking the football, that you just don't do on fourth down,' chided Bleacher Report. 'You would think that of all people, Joe Montana's son....would know that.'

Bleacher Report conceded that Montana was under a lot of pressure when he made his decision.

USA Today was a little less harsh overall, but still called the move 'one of the worst mental blunders of the season.'
