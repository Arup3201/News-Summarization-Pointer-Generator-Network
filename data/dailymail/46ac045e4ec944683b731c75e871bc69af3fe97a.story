True original: Although reclusive, Cy Twombly became a star of the contemporary art world

American painter Cy Twombly, renowned for his large-scale scribbled canvases, has died in Rome at the age of 83.         

Twombly never had an easy ride with 
art experts, who questioned whether his calligraphic style and use of 
words and graffiti in paintings were worthy of a place at the high table
of 20th century abstract art. 

But the painter, who shunned publicity, 
was a star of the contemporary art world by the time of his death.

Less 
than two months ago a Twombly work from 1967, 'Untitled', sold for $15.2
million at Christie's in New York.

Only last year he was invited to 
paint the ceiling of the Salle des Bronzes at the Louvre in Paris, only 
the third contemporary artist to be given such an honour.  

The resulting work was an abstract 
composition on a blue background complementing Georges Braque's ceiling 
in the adjoining gallery. 

On it appeared the names of the most 
celebrated classical Greek sculptors of the fourth century, underlining 
Twombly's fascination for classical art and history.   

Gagosian Gallery, which represented the artist, did not give the cause of his death, although media reports said that Twombly had been suffering from cancer.

Italy's Ansa news agency said he had been hospitalised in Rome for a few days and had wanted to be buried in the city.               

Larry Gagosian said in a statement: 'The art world has lost a true genius and a completely original talent, and for those fortunate enough to have known him, a great human being.

'We will not soon see a talent of such amazing scope and intensity.

'Even though Cy might have been regarded as reclusive, he didn't retreat to an ivory tower. He was happy to remain connected and live in the present.'            

This piece, entitled Venus, dates from 1975. Despite his abstract style Twombly was fascinated by classical art and history

Gagosian added that Twombly, who 
divided critics throughout his life and often refused to fit in with the
trends of the day, never lost his sense of humour and always remained 
humble.       

He 
settled permanently in Italy in the late 1950s, even as the art world 
was heading in the opposite direction - from Europe to New York - a move
the New York Times called 'the most symbolic of his 
idiosyncrasies'.             

Twombly
was born in Lexington, Virginia, in 1928. He studied in a number of 
U.S. art colleges before travelling extensively in Europe. He served as a
cryptologist in the U.S. military in the early 1950s.
