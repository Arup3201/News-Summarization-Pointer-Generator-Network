An off-road racing enthusiast and rodeo clown has survived being struck by lightning twice during the same harrowing storm in St. Jo, Texas on Saturday.

Casey Wagner, 31, said on Sunday that doctors told him a tingling feeling all throughout his body would last for about a week. Miraculously, tingling is the worst of Wagner's injuries.

KTVT-TV  reports Wagner was at an off-road competition in Saint Jo, 85 miles northwest of Dallas, when storms arrived. The event, named Rednecks with Paychecks, hosts hundreds of racers who also camp out at the huge site.

Wagner and two of his friends were searching for shelter from the storm when they stopped under a tree. One of his friends ran off to find a bathroom while Wagner was left beneath the tree with his friend's father.

He was standing 5 feet away from his friend's father when he was struck by lightning--twice. He dropped to his knees then he was struck again. Wagner says he saw sparks during the strikes.

He felt electricity in his chest and the feeling then shot up through his arm and left wrist.

'What I remember is just a loud boom and it dropped me to my knees and then it hit me again,' Wagner said. 'When I got hit, it was just two big ol’ flashes and then sparks went everywhere.'

A nurse who happened to be nearby cared for Wagner until he was taken to Nacona General Hospital a few miles away where he was treated and released.

'At the hospital they said the poncho I was wearing was carrying static because it was one of those plastic ones,' Wagner told KTVT-TV.

As if saved by some miracle, Wagner's injuries are nothing but a little shakiness.

Wagner told doctors that he believed his heart skipped a beat. He lost feeling in his lower right leg and his left arm.

'I’ve got all the feeling back. It just feels like my whole body is waking up from… like if your arm falls asleep, that’s how my whole body feels,'

According to doctors, Wagner should regain feeling in about a week.

Wagner told Mail Online, 'I'm still weak and tingly. If symptoms don't get better within a week I'll go back to the doctor.'

Wagner says he believes God kept him alive.

'I give everything to God,' he said. 'So I owe everything to him, he’s the one that kept me alive. I can tell you one thing, I’m going to start going to church more.'

When asked how the experience changed him, Wagner laughed and told Mail Online, 'I don't take life for granted anymore. Reminds me to keep on living life and not act stupid.'
