The Bank of England nearly doubled its spending on wine and champagne last year as it splashed out on leaving parties for senior officials including former governor Mervyn King.

It spent £7,990 on 756 bottles in 2013 – a rise of 94 per cent from 2012 when it bought 444 bottles for £4,126.

Leaving parties were laid on for deputy governor Paul Tucker, finance director Warwick Jones and HR boss Catherine Brown.

The increased spending on wine and champagne will raise eyebrows as it came when the economy was only just pulling out of recession and the recovery was still fragile.

The Bank by reputation used to have the second best wine cellar in the City of London behind the Stock Exchange.

It spent more than £26,000 on leaving gifts and parties to mark the retirement of Lord King who was succeeded by Canadian Mark Carney in July last year after 10 years as governor.

That is in line with the salary of the average worker in the UK.

Lord King was showered with gifts worth £13,102 and treated to three farewell events - a drinks reception and two dinners - costing another £13,423.

He received a copy of a £10,000 painting of himself as well as a £2,505 bust of German politician and writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and a £597 silver napkin ring.

The original painting hangs at the Bank alongside portraits of the men who have held the position since the first governor in 1694.

There has never been a female governor and Nemat Shafik was this week named as only the second woman in the Bank’s 320 history to be deputy governor.

Lord King earned a £300,000 salary and enjoys a pension from the Bank believed to be worth more than £200,000 a year.

Mr Tucker, who was seen as a frontrunner to succeed Lord King but was beaten to the post by Mr Carney, was given two leaving parties at a total cost of £9,164.75.

Mr Tucker, who was deputy governor for financial stability, was caught up in the Libor rate-rigging scandal and departed the Bank shortly after the arrival of Mr Carney.

The Bank, which is owned by the Treasury, is not directly funded by taxpayers, instead raising cash from a variety of sources including the financial sector.

The main source is known as the ‘cash ratio deposit’, under which lenders deposit cash interest-free.

The Bank then ploughs this into investments that pay interest, and keeps the difference for itself.

A spokesman for the central bank said: ‘The Bank of England, as the nation’s central bank, hosts a number of business-related receptions each year.

These provide important opportunities for the Bank to interact with a wide range of economic, financial, academic and international audiences, and form part of our obligations as an active member of the international central banking community.

‘The Bank provides refreshments at such events, and this involves purchasing food and beverages, including wine, for current and future use, taking advantage of bulk cost savings where possible.

'In 2013, the Bank hosted several leaving events in addition to business receptions, including those for the outgoing Governor, and deputy governor of financial stability.’
