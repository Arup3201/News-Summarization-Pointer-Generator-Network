A former girlfriend of George Soros had her civil case against the billionaire businessman thrown out after a sudden outburst in court on Thursday.

Adriana Ferreyr, 31, had filed a $50million lawsuit against the 84-year-old after the two split in 2011, saying he had given away a $1.9million apartment promised to her to girlfriend Tamiko Bolton, who is now his wife, and alleging that he also inflicted emotional damage by slapping her during a fight and having his security guards 'stalk' her.

The entire suit was dismissed though by Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Debra James after an incident in which Ferreyr 'lunged at her ex-boyfriend’s lawyer during a Manhattan court hearing and angrily snatched away legal papers while yelling.'

This all comes almost one year to the day  that Ferreyr allegedly called Soros a 'f***ing a**hole' and then lunged at him, knocking his glasses of his head during a deposition.

The New York Post reports that on Thursday, Ferryr, who is currently representing herself having gone through three sets of lawyers, had been convinced by Judge James to sign 'medical release forms related to injuries she allegedly sustained from Soros.'

Almost as soon as she signed them though, she had a sudden change of heart.

According to a witness, she lunged at Soros' lawyer, Andrew Brettler, and 'aggressively' snatched the folder from him.

'She got angry' said a source. 

'At one point she blurted out, "They’re going to get the information and reveal it to the press to embarrass me."'

Ferreyr, now 31, and Soros, now 84, dated for five years, ending their relationship in 2001

That is when Judge James announced; 'That’s it. Case dismissed. Your behavior is contemptuous.'

Ferreyr disputes these claims though, admitting that while she was 'upset,' she had just reached across the table to get a piece of paper she signed which was unrelated to her case. 

She also vowed that she would hire a new lawyer and continue to fight her case.

In June of last year, Soros offered Ferryr a settlement of $6.9million, which she reportedly declined.
