Solitary polar bears have become the poster boys of global warming.

Standing on melting glaciers, their saddened faces are often plastered over posters, adverts and brochures warning of the dangers of greenhouse gas emissions.

But some scientists say polar bears, are far from endangered. Instead, they claim, the creatures are being used as political weapons in the heated debate on climate change.

'Canadian Inuit say that now is the "time with the most bears",' Mitchell Taylor, a biologist who has been researching polar bears in Canada and around the Arctic Circle for 30 years, told MailOnline.

'In spite of claims to the contrary, there is no reliable scientific evidence that polar bear numbers have declined in any subpopulation so far.'

There are an estimated 25,000 bears in the whole of the Arctic and around 60 per cent of those are in Canada, according to the Polar Bear Specialist Group (PBSG).

The PBSG estimates that we could lose two-thirds of the world's polar bears by the middle of the century unless the world takes action on climate change.

But the same group earlier this year admitted to polar bear specialist Susan Crockford that the estimate was 'simply a qualified guess given to satisfy public demand.'

Andrew Derocher, a professor of biological sciences at the University of Alberta and past PBSG chair, has spent 30 years studying polar bears.

A new tool allows people to watch polar bears as they pad across the ice of Hudson Bay, Canada, from the comfort of their homes.

The Bear Tracker (interactive map below) shows the current location of a number of polar bears as well as sea ice levels in the area.

By clicking on a bear in the interactive map, you can see what date it was collared, how many cubs it has, its weight and the distance it has travelled. There is also an option to sponsor the bear.

The map, created by Winnipeg-based Polar Bears International, can also be used to see the shrinking of areas of sea ice over the past 30 years, as water temperature are believed to have risen.

Despite the controversy over numbers, he is adamant that polar bear groups will start going extinct by mid-century as a direct result of climate change.

'It is an international standard to consider conservation of a species using the "three generation rule" looking forward in time,' he told MailOnline.

'For polar bears, three generations is somewhere in the 36 to 45 year timeframe. In this timeframe, sea ice scientists, predict significant changes in the amount of the Arctic covered in sea ice.'

According to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), ice levels are 'likely' to fall below one million square kilometres by 2050 due to man-made global warming.

'Polar bears are a habitat specialist: they are not found anywhere that sea ice does not persist. If the sea ice disappears, the bears will too.'

But Dr Taylor takes issue with both Dr Derocher's and the IPCC's predictions on climate change.

'Climate models have actually done a poor job of predicting climate warming and sea ice decline,' he said.

'My crystal ball says that suggestions of 4.5-5°C warming is unlikely given the warming so far and given the limitations on fossil fuel.'

In 2008, Dr Taylor signed the Manhattan Declaration on climate change, which argued that there was no conclusive evidence that emissions from industrial activity was causing climate change.

He said that if CO2 is really driving the current warming trend, then we could see maybe another degree of warming, which would not be a threat to polar bears.

'It is not a crisis, just a change that is within the range of historical variation,' he added.

And even if polar bears did suffer a loss of ice, Dr Taylor points out that, as a species, polar bears have survived for four million years and have 'behavioural plasticity'.

'That means they evolved even before the Pleistocene glacial cycles, even before there was perennial sea ice in the Arctic Ocean,' he said.

And he points out that polar bears can live on stored fat to live for long periods. Pregnant females, for instance, can go eight months without eating.

Dr Taylor said that since he made his views known, he has been ostracised by the polar bear scientific community.

Indeed, Dr Derocher is outspoken in his views on scientists who don't believe that polar bears are threatened by climate change.

'Some of the scientists that are claiming resilience in polar bears are being paid by right-wing climate change denier groups,' he said. 'These individuals are paid to obfuscate the scientific data.

'If polar bears could garner the resources they need on land, why do they lose about 0.8-0.9 kg of body mass per day?

'Why do some polar bears starve while on land waiting for the sea ice to reform?'

But Dr Taylor claims the figures just don't add up.

'I think it is a bit crazy to speculate about a climate future 50 or 100 years in advance, then guess about how polar bears might respond to this hypothetical climate future, then declare a crisis because the guess was they won't do very well,' said Dr Taylor.

'Especially when the current models don't seem to be able to predict either temperature or sea ice very well so far.'

According to the Polar Bear Specialist Group (PBSG), we could lose two-thirds of polar bears by the middle of the century unless the world takes action on climate change. But Dr Taylor claims the figures just don't add up
