A pensioner had a lucky escape after her car got stuck on top of a brick wall while she tried to reverse out of her garage.

Margaret Holliday had to be rescued by paramedics after her silver Hyundai Getz was left teetering on the edge of the wall and another resident's lawn in Moseley, Birmingham.

The 81-year-old was trying to edge back out of her garage when her brakes failed and sent her flying backwards, at about midday on Saturday afternoon. 

The woman, in her eighties, had a lucky escape after she managed to get her car stuck on top of a brick wall

Her car became stuck and had to be hoisted off the three brick high wall by the fire service.

She said: 'I was just parking up in my garage when I realised I was still a bit close to the entrance and the door wouldn't shut so I needed to edge back just about six inches.

'But instead of being six inches it ended up being more like six metres.

'As I took my foot off the brake it launched backwards out of the garage, across the little bit of lawn - by gosh it was scary.

'Then the car was just teetering on the wall - it's only small so I thought I'd be able to get out.

'I didn't realise how high up I was and when I tried to step out, I tumbled out, banged my head and ended up on my bum.

Fire crews believe she got her foot jammed on the accelerator as she attempted to reverse out of her garage

'The noise when the car hit the wall was huge and that's when all the neighbours rushed out and helped me get to my feet.'

'I have a minor scratch on my hand and a bump on my head and when I took my car to the garage they said my brakes had failed and would have to do some repairs but thankfully the wall itself didn't do too much damage.'

Margaret was treated by a paramedic at the scene and is recovering at home but is hoping to have her car back, with new brakes and an exhaust, by the end of the week. 

Dave Clark, Highgate Fire crew manager, said: 'On arrival West Midlands Ambulance had managed to lift her down from the car.

'It appeared as though the lady had reversed out her garage, and her foot had become jammed on the accelerator.

'Fortunately a tree had prevented the car from falling over the edge. The crew then winched the car to safety.'

'The woman was doing fine, though of course it was a bit of a shock. 

She escaped with minor injuries and was treated at the scene while her car was winched to safety by crews
