Danny Dash was jailed for nine years at Canterbury Crown Court after admitting causing grievous bodily harm.

A thug who gouged out a love rival's eye after telling him to 'sleep with one eye open' has been jailed for nine years.

Mark Clark, 44, was attacked yards from his home in Swalecliffe, Kent, by Danny Dash, 30.

The incident, which happened after he intervened in a fight between his former partner and a friend, has left him blind in one eye and has restricted vision in the other.

Canterbury Crown Court heard on Friday how there was 'bad' blood between Mr Clark and Dash after Dash started a relationship with Mr Clark's then-girlfriend Emma Long.

This had led to a bitter split, and Mr Clark had received threats not to contact his former partner because she was now with him.

On the night of the incident, in June, a fight broke out between Emma Long and Michelle Rule, Mr Clark's friend.

During the incident the court heard how Mr Clark saw Dash stamp on Miss Rule and decided to intervene, and then Dash pushed his thumbs into Mr Clark's eyes, causing the permanent damage.

A witness described seeing Mr Clark curled up in the foetal position with Dash holding him around the neck with his fingers in his eyes.

The attack only ended when a neighbour intervened and hit dash with a walking stick, finding Mr Clark screeching in pain with blood dripping from his eye socket.

Prosecuting, Lucy Luttman, said: 'The defendant pushed his thumbs into his eyes, in effect gouging the eyes out.

Mark Clark, 44, says that his life has been changed forever since the attack by love rival Danny Dash.
Mr Clark says that if it wasn't for a neighbour hitting Dash with his walking stick, the attack could have been so much worse

Mark Clark, 44, is now blind in one eye and has restricted vision in the other.
Before the June assault he was told by Danny Dash to 'sleep with one eye open'

'Mr Clark began screaming that he had had enough, but dash didn't let go and continued to push his thumbs for approximately 30 seconds'

Dash, from Canterbury admitted causing grievous bodily harm, but Mr Clark says that his life has been changed forever.

He said after the case: 'I remember everything. I was screaming in pain.

'I thought he was trying to kill me. If a neighbour hadn't stopped him I could have lost both eyes.

'I remember him (Dash) being hit with a walking stick. I get headaches and I can't stop thinking about what he has taken away from me.'

He added: 'I don't look how I used to look. Without my sight it has affected my walking, my security.

'He has deformed my face and when I look in the mirror I don't feel confident. It has changed everything and the way I feel about everyone.'

On sentencing Dash to nine years in prison Judge Simon James said: 'This was a use of extreme violence and its effects on your victim have been devastating.

'There is also a degree of premeditation in what you did and your self-serving account makes it difficult to accept that your remorse is genuine.'
