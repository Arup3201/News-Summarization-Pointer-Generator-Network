The house where 12-year-old Tia Sharp was sexually assaulted and murdered in August 2012 before her body was hidden in the loft has been demolished and two new houses are being built on the site

Work is under way on the new houses, bringing a new start to the community that was traumatised by the murder of the schoolgirl.

The two-bedroom terraced house - 20 The Lindens in New Addington, Surrey - was bulldozed in June last year, along with the two neighbouring properties (numbers 19 and 21).

Work is under way on two new houses, bringing a new start to the community that was traumatised by the murder of Tia Sharp  by her grandmother's boyfriend

The site of the three houses demolished by Croydon Council last year and soon to be the site of two more 

Tia was murdered by pervert Stuart Hazell who lived with Christine Sharp, 48, Tia's grandmother

The decision to bulldoze delighted Tia's family and neighbours who were upset by the sight of the house.

It was where killer Stuart Hazell, 39, murdered the schoolgirl and dumped her body in the loft.

He was living there with his girlfriend Christine Sharp, 48, Tia's grandmother.

Hazell was one of the 'heartbroken' family members who 'searched' for Tia during a national manhunt in August 2012 after she disappeared.

As the distraught and desperate family members comforted each other in the house, they were unaware that missing Tia was just feet away from them, wrapped in bin-liners in the loft.

Father-of-one Hazell suffocated Tia during a sex attack after months of trawling internet pornography sites and filming her as she slept.

Her body was not found for more than a week by police - even though it just feet away from where they had been searching.

The property, which is owned by Croydon Council, was demolished to avoid it becoming a  tourist attraction.

Two adjoining houses were also demolished by the council and now building work has been going to replace the three bulldozed properties with two new ones.

A Croydon Council spokesman said: "With the support of residents and local councillors, we decided that demolishing the properties at 19, 20 and 21 The Lindens was the best thing to do given the circumstances of what happened.

"The demolition work has now been completed, and building of two new family homes in their place has begun."

So far, workmen have built the foundations and constructed the shell of the ground level of the houses.

It is not known when the new properties will be finished and ready to inhabit.

Hazell, who lied that Tia had spent the night at home before heading to a shopping centre in nearby Croydon, was jailed for life in May last year.

He pleaded not guilty before changing his plea to guilty on the fifth day of his trial at the Old Bailey.
