A Las Vegas man testified before the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday, telling the heartbreaking story about how his mother suffered a slow and painful death from E. coli complications after eating a few spoonfuls of tainted cookie dough.

Linda Rivera died at the age of 61 in July 2013,  four years after she ate some cookie dough that was later recalled for traces of the dangerous bacteria. 

Her son Richard Simpson said Thursday that stricter regulations could prevent further needless loss of life, like that of his mother.

However, experts say the cookie dough wasn't ultimately what killed the woman.  

Linda Rivera died in July 2013, and her son believes the cause of her death is a few bites of raw cookie dough she ate four years prior which gave her a deadly strain of E. coli 

Nestle recalled their Toll House Cookie Dough in 2009 amid reports of E. coli. They also closed down their facilities which were thoroughly cleaned before opening up for production again, using new ingredients

The former high school teacher aide's health problems trace back to  May 2009, when she took a package of Nestle cookie dough to the living room couch to indulge.

'You watch a commercial, you go into a store and you just assume it's okay to eat,' her husband Richard Rivera told the Washington Post in 2009. 'I assume if it's on a shelf, it's safe. But this whole thing has changed the way I look at food.'

Just seven days later, Rivera's kidneys stopped functioning, sending her into septic shock. 

When Nestle found out that several people had been experiencing symptoms of E. coli they shut down the Danville, Virginia, plant that makes their prepackaged Toll House cookie dough and recalled 3.6million packages of their product - costing $30 to $50 million.  

They cleaned the plant thoroughly, but then opened up a month later using new ingredients and adding an extra warning to not eat raw dough on their packaging. Rivera settled with the company before her death, for an undisclosed amount. 

Rivera appears to be the victim who was most injured in the outbreak., unusual for a middle aged woman since E. coli usually affects the very old and very young the most. 

For the next few years she kept getting sicker and sicker and eventually passed away in July 2013, from medical complications her son believes started with the cookie dough.

'There were moments of hope - and of despair,' 22-year-old Mr Simpson said on Thursday, according to ABC News. 'She fought very hard. We knew she didn't want to give up.'

Mr Simpson is now fighting to make changes to the FDA's Food Safety Modernization Act which would include updates that would more effectively stop the spread of E. coli bacteria. 

Experts point out, however, that Rivera's batter with E. coli is not what ended up killing her in the end. 

'She never really recovered completely from her initial illness, and then developed a series of medical complications,' Dr William Schaffner, a professor at the Vanderbilt School of Medicine, told ABC News.

Nestle has issued a statement on Rivera's battle.  

'The fact that our product was implicated in Linda Rivera’s 2009 illness and tragic passing was obviously of grave concern to all of us at Nestle. 

'Since then, we have implemented more stringent testing and inspection of raw materials and finished product to ensure the product meets our high quality standards. 

'In addition, we have switched to using heat-treated flour to further enhance safety. We continue to emphasize that the cookie dough should be consumed only after baking and not eaten raw.'
