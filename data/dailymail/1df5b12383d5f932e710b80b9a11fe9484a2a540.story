The Ebola crisis has provided the latest opportunity for Democratic hopefuls in tough races  to set themselves apart from their beleaguered party head.

Democratic Sens. Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Kay Hagan of North Carolina have both offered differing policies from President Barack Obama when it comes to handling the deadly disease, as has Georgia senate candidate Michelle Nunn.

In the House at least nine Democrats, including Nick Rahall of West Virginia and Krysten Sinema of Arizona, have asked the president to revisit his decision not to block individuals flying out of West Africa from entering the U.S.

Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor is one of a dozen Democrats who says he would take a different approach to fending off an Ebola epidemic than president Barack Obama. Unlike Obama, Pryor says he supports a temporary ban on travel to the U.S. from West Africa

President Barack Obama, right, is pictured here meeting with Ron Klain, then chief of staff to the Vice President, and Cynthia Hogan, counsel to the vice-president, in the Oval Office, in this May 21, 2009 photograph. Obama named Klain as his administration's Ebola response coordinator on Friday to Republicans' annoyance

Their efforts to show a clear distinction between the way they would respond to the Ebola outbreak and the president's actions comes as anger over Obama's response to the Ebola epidemic has escalated among Republicans, who are are now up in arms over his choice for Ebola czar.

Lawmakers' divergence from the president's approach to managing the health scare mirrors a poll newly released by Politico  that shows that just 22 percent of likely voters in battleground states have 'a lot of confidence' that the government 'is doing everything possible to contain the spread of Ebola.'

Another 33 percent said they have no or little confidence in the government's handling of the situation so far. And that survey was conducted before a third Ebola patient was diagnosed in the U.S.

The poll did not ask what respondents would like to see the government do differently, but a survey conducted by ABC News and the Washington Post at roughly the same time found that two-thirds of Americans support a temporary moratorium on travel to the U.S. from the three West African countries being savaged by Ebola.

Members of Congress have responded in kind, and more than a dozen Democrats now say they are in favor of travel restrictions. They join nearly a hundred of their Republican colleagues in demanding that the president do more to stop possible Ebola carriers from coming to the country.

'It is clear that the piece-meal approach to contain this outbreak is not enough. We need a comprehensive strategy,' Arkansas' Pryor said in a statement on Friday.

'It starts with a travel ban for non-citizens coming to the U.S. from affected areas and a stepped-up screening process conducted by health professionals for Americans returning from West Africa,' the incumbent senator, who is locked in a tight race for his seat with Arkansas GOP Rep. Tom Cotton, added.

North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan speaks at a press conference on Wednesday, Oct. 15 in Charlotte, North Carolina. Hagan said then that a travel ban wouldn't 'help solve this problem.' On Friday she said she supports travel restrictions

Pryor's concise support for a travel ban follows an interview he did with MSNBC earlier this month in which he struggled to say whether the Obama administration had responded to Ebola appropriately and aggressively enough.

'Uhhhhmmm...' he told network correspondent Kasie Hunt. 'I would say that it's hard to know because I haven't heard the latest briefing on that.'

North Carolina's Hagan also said that unlike the president, she supports a travel ban on Friday - just two days after saying at a news conference that it 'wouldn't help solve this problem' or 'contain the epidemic that we see happening in Africa.'

Hagan said in a statement on Friday, 'I have said for weeks that travel restrictions should be one part of a broad strategy to prevent Ebola from spreading in the U.S. and fighting it in Africa.

'Although stopping the spread of this virus overseas will require a large, coordinated effort with the international community, a temporary travel ban is a prudent step the President can take to protect the American people, and I believe he should do so immediately.'

Hagan's GOP opponent in the race, Thom Tillis, has said he's in favor of travel restrictions for several weeks.

The Republican National Committee jumped on Hagan's change of heart on Friday and told the Daily Mail in an email on Monday that 'Senator Hagan did a full flip-flop.'

'She went from calling the proposed ban a "scare tactic" to essentially endorsing the proposed ban that Tillis put forward weeks ago,' RNC spokesman Rob Lockwood said. 'Senator Hagan should quit the games, acknowledge her 180 degree turn, and admit that Thom Tillis was right all along on this issue.'

Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate Michelle Nunn, right, hugs a supporter at a rally last Wednesday before casting her own ballot in early voting at the Adamsville Recreation Center in Atlanta, Georgia. Nunn also came out in favor of a travel ban on Friday

In Georgia, Democratic senate candidate and non-profit head Nunn sided with her potential colleagues and voiced her support for a travel ban on Friday, too.

'I support a temporary travel ban with the exceptions of our medical and military personnel in those affected areas in West Africa and I believe that we need to look to our medical practitioners, leaders and scientists and make sure we’re giving them the resources,' Nunn told the Washington Post.

In a similar statement released the same day Nunn also contended that 'our leaders in Washington must provide clear, bipartisan and strong leadership as well as the resources we need to stop the spread of Ebola.'

The Georgia Democrat was involved in a short-lived controversy last week when she refused to tell a tracker for a Republican organization whether she voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012. 

She confirmed to the Post on Friday that she did vote for Obama while touting her bipartisan credentials. 

Nunn's Republican opponent in the race, businessman David Perdue, has attacked her as a rubber stamp for Obama's policies and released an ad featuring a photo of her and Obama.

Today she released an ad explaining why she was pictured with the president and that the photo was taken at an event for her non-profit that held in honor of former President George HW Bush.

Democrats in the House have also been quick to separate themselves from the ostracized president, whose approval rating has consistently been underwater throughout the election cycle.

In addition to West Virginia's Rahall and Arizona's Sinema, John Barrow of Georgia, Alan Grayson of Florida, Dave Loebsack of Iowa, Scott Peters of California,  David Scott of Georgia, Collin Peterson, Minnesota and Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii have joined the procession of Democratic lawmakers lobbying the president to institute a travel ban.

Even vulnerable Democrats have not been nearly as vocal as Republicans in critiquing the president over Ebola, however.

Republicans went from upset to outraged with the president on Friday after he announced his pick for Ebola czar.

After arguing that the White House needed to designate one administration official to direct its response to the heath scare, Republicans got their wish on Friday when Obama brought on Ron Klain, a former chief of staff to two vice presidents, to act as its Ebola response coordinator.

They immediately began disparaging Klain's credentials, though, and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz led the charge, arguing on Friday and again on CNN's State of the Union on Sunday that Klain has no business managing a health crisis.

'Mr. Klain is not a doctor. He's not a health care professional. He doesn't have background in these issues,' Cruz said. 'We don't need a White House political operative, which is what Mr. Klain has been. 

'What we need is presidential leadership. The person who needs to be on top of this is the president of the United States,' Cruz stated.

Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions also came out swinging against Klain on Friday, saying in a statement that the 'American people can have zero confidence in Ron Klain’s competence to carry out this critical role.'

'Ebola is a health crisis. Yet the President has appointed as his new Ebola ‘czar’ a partisan loyalist whose expertise is politics—not health,' Sessions argued.

'One would think, faced with the prospect of an epidemic, the President would task an expert in epidemiology not an expert in political spin.

Noting that he supports both a travel ban and barring of visas for anyone from countries plagued with Ebola, Sessions said, 'The Administration continues to refuse to implement even the most commonsense immigration controls to protect public health and public tax dollars. 

'Mr. Klain’s appointment, unfortunately, suggests things will get worse—not better.'
