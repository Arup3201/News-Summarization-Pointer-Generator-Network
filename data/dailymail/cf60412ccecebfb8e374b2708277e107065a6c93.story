An entire Scottish island has gone up for sale for £350,000 - less than half the price of a one-bedroom flat in central London.

Holm of Huip - one of the smaller of the Orkney Islands which lie 10 miles north of the Scottish mainland - boasts 62 acres of land, picturesque beaches and its own pod of seals.

But the drawbacks to any potential owner are that the island is only accessible by boat or helicopter and has no electricity, running water or habitable buildings.

The Orkney Island of Holm of Huip has gone up for sale for £350,000 - for which a buyer will get 62 acres of beautiful Scottish coastline

The tiny island, which has not been inhabited for a century, boasts a number of picturesque beaches and its own pod of seals

There are no buildings on the island and rules mean the potential buyer may only be allowed to live there for three months in the summer

Holm of Huip lies just off the coast of Stronsay, a better-known Orkney island which has a population of around 350.

Sellers Vladi Private Islands, have listed the island for sale for around £350,000 - more than £400,000 lower than the average one-bed property in inner London.

The seals and the ruins of a stone house  are all that remains on the island, which is formed from old red sandstone.

If an interested party were to buy the island, it would be lived-on for the first time in more than 100 years, although there are legal barriers restricting anyone from living there permanently, with short stays of up to three months in the summer generally permitted.

Pedro Arez, director ofVladi Private Islands, said: 'The area was thought to be occupied by Vikings and is known to have a number of archaeological sites containing artefacts which are centuries old.'

The 250,000 square-metre island was bought by a German family who were interested in its history and is also used by local fisherman

The ruins of a  house are the only signs of civilisation on the island - which was once used by the Vikings and is of archaeological interest

Mr Arez added: 'A German family bought the island from me because they were so interested in its rich history.

'The remains of Viking longboats and cairn have been discovered up and down the island, usually by local fishermen. The island has been uninhabited for more than 100 years, with the only remaining building the ruins of an old stone house.

'Due to Scottish property laws, permanent living could be problem, but the eventual owner would be free to use the island as a home away from home in the summer.'

According to the latest Right Move price index, the average price for a property in inner London is £755,655 as of January 2015 - more than two times the asking price of Holm of Huip.
