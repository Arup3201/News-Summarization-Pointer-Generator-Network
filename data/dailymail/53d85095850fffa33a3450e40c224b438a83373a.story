Commonwealth spokesman Winston McKenzie has said that Nigel Farage is like Jesus and UKIP members are his followers

Nigel Farage is like Jesus and Ukip members are his followers, one of the party’s candidates has claimed.

Commonwealth spokesman Winston McKenzie, who is a former professional boxer and has previously courted controversy with remarks about gay adoption, said the party leader can ‘do no wrong’.

‘Jesus was one man, we’re his army. Farage is one man, and we’re his army and that’s what it’s all about,’ he said.

‘Everywhere he goes, it doesn’t matter what he says or does - he gets away with it.’

Mr McKenzie joined Ukip after previously being a member of the Conservatives, Lib Dems and his own Unity party. He has stood to be an MP, Mayor of London and a local councillor, but lost his deposit on every occasion.

‘The one thing with Farage is there’s (sic) no heirs and graces, you do business. He’s a strong leader,’ he said in the interview with Chat Politics. ‘Farage is like (non-stick) Teflon – he can do no wrong.’

Mr McKenzie, who described himself as ‘not your average politician’, has developed a reputation for making controversial pronouncements.

While standing for Ukip in the 2012 Croydon North by-election, he described gay adoption as ‘tantamount to child abuse’ and ‘unhealthy’.

Asked by Chat Politics for his views on same-sex marriage, he said: ‘I have nothing against gay people, I’m not some kind of homophobe but I am entitled to express my heartfelt opinion.’

Mr McKenzie said that he favours a quota on immigrants coming into the country.

He said: ‘For every extra person that comes into this country, a British person has to do without and I’m not talking here colour or creed.

‘I define British as someone who comes here and toils and works and stands up for the traditions of the place they live.’

Earlier this year, Mr McKenzie described Croydon – where he was standing as a local councillor – as ‘unsafe and a dump’ after Mr Farage pulled out of appearing at a ‘Ukip carnival’ there.

He made a rap video during his 2008 campaign to be Mayor of London and previously auditioned for the X Factor.
