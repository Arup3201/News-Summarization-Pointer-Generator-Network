A dramatic drop in lending by Britain’s ‘risk-adverse’ banks since the economic crisis has boosted business for controversial payday loan firms, experts claim.

New figures show that loans issued by five major UK banks plummeted by £365billion in the past five years.

A survey by accountants KPMG revealed that lending had fallen by 14 per cent, from £2.7trillion to £2.3trillion since 2009, leaving a gap in the market for ‘shadow marketing initiatives’.

The survey compared lending in the second half of 2009 to the first half of 2014 at Standard Chartered, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays (above), HSBC and Lloyds Banking Group

It warned that, in an effort to clean up their act after the financial crisis, banks may have gone too far in restricting lending and had forgotten that banking always included an element of risk. It means some consumers have been pushed towards high-interest payday loans in a bid to raise funds.

The survey compared lending in the second half of 2009 to the first half of 2014 at Standard Chartered, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays, HSBC and Lloyds Banking Group.

Richard McCarthy, UK head of banking at KPMG, said: ‘We have to remember that banking requires risk-taking. Yet in the rush to clean up the past, both banks and regulators have lost sight of this.

‘The reduction in lending to customers since 2009 is testament to this risk-aversion. People need to borrow and they will look at other ways to do that if they cannot borrow through their bank.’

Citizens Advice urged banks to issue small, short-term loans at low interest – so that people did not turn to payday loan firms. Chief executive Gillian Guy, said: ‘Ultimately, people need more choice. There is a role for high-street banks to play by offering responsible, short-term micro-loans.’

China will overtake the United States to become the world’s biggest economy in just ten years, according to a report.

The US has been the world’s economic leader for more than a century, but a huge rise in consumer spending in China is expected to see it passed in 2024.

Chinese consumer spending is predicted to triple over the next decade, according to an IHS report – increasing from £2.14trillion to £6.4trillion.

Earlier this month, the charity StepChange said the number of people struggling with payday loans had risen by 42 per cent in the past year, as customers tried to keep up with sky-high interest rates.

The drop in lending reported by KPMG includes £309billion of consumer and business loans and a £56billion reduction in loans to other banks. The fall points to the continued struggle to get banks to lend to small and medium-sized businesses, a vital part of Britain’s economy.

John Longworth, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said yesterday: ‘The banks have always been risk-adverse about lending to small and medium-sized businesses but, since the recession, they have been extraordinarily so.’

Four years ago, the Daily Mail launched its Make the Banks Lend campaign to highlight the plight of small firms that could not get the money they needed to grow.
