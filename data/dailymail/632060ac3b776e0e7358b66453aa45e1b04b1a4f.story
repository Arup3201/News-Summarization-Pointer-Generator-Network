Hero: Shakil Afridi, the doctor who helped the CIA track down Osama bin Laden, was accused of dubious murder charges by Pakistan on Friday

The heroic doctor who helped the United States pinpoint Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was hit with a bizarre murder charge in Pakistan on Friday.

Shakil Afridi, 49, was accused of killing a teenage boy who died after the doctor performed surgery on 
him for appendicitis in 2006, a development which could further strain ties between the two countries.

Afridi ran a vaccination program for the CIA to collect DNA in an 
attempt to verify Bin Laden's presence in the 
town of Abbottabad, prior to the U.S. raid that killed him in 2011.

That secret operation outraged Pakistan and plunged relations between the strategic partners to a new low.

Pakistan
arrested Afridi after the raid and sentenced him last year to 33 years 
in jail for 'conspiring against the state' and membership of militant 
group Lashkar-e-Islam.

The doctor's family and the militants denied the allegations.

In August, Pakistan overturned his conviction, citing procedural errors and ordering a retrial.

Afridi is currently imprisoned in Peshawar Central Jail.

Friday's murder charge, relating to 
the death of a patient eight years ago, dims Afridi's chances of going 
free and could further sour ties with the United States.

It centers on the death of Suleman Afridi, at a hospital in Pakistan's rugged Khyber Agency region in 2005, and was brought by the man's mother, a local official told Reuters.

'A woman blamed Afridi for the death of her son,' the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.Â 

'She stated that he operated on her son at a hospital in Khyber Agency even though he was not a surgeon, and that caused (her son's) death.'

No further details of the case were immediately available. Afridi is not a relative of the doctor, despite the shared surname.

Afridi's lawyer, Samiullah Afridi, also no relative, said the case had no merit because too much time had passed 
since the incident. The trial has been scheduled for mid-December, he 
said.

Afridi's situation has sparked widely 
divergent views inside and outside of Pakistan. In the U.S. and other 
Western nations, Afridi was viewed as a hero who had helped eliminate 
the world's most wanted man.

Pakistani
officials were outraged by the bin Laden operation, which led to 
international suspicion that they had been harboring Al Qaeda's founder.

In their eyes, Afridi was a traitor who had collaborated with a foreign spy agency in an illegal operation on Pakistani soil.

The Khyber Agency, on the border with Afghanistan, is part of the semiautonomous areas where tribal law holds sway instead of Pakistan's judicial system, and the government is represented instead by a political agent.

Afridi is a last name shared by members of the Pashtun tribe of that name.
