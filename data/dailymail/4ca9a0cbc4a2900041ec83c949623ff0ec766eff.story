They're sisters, they’re all four years old – but, remarkably, these three little girls are not triplets.

The eldest, Cara, was just nine months old when she became a big sister to twins Laura and Jenna.

Her mother, Tessa Singh, 40, had become pregnant again within 12 weeks of her birth, and the twins were born prematurely at 28 weeks.

It means for three months of each year, the sisters are all the same age.

Mrs Singh said: ‘People can’t believe it when I tell them all the girls are the same age, yet they aren’t triplets.

‘I can’t quite believe I’ve given birth to three girls in just nine months. I’ve certainly had my hands full.’

Mrs Singh, a teacher, and her hairdresser husband Daynie, 39, had their first daughter Cara in July 2008. They started trying for another baby three months later.

Mrs Singh said: ‘We had wanted to have babies close together so we thought when Cara was three months old that we should start trying as we didn’t know how long it would take.

Happy surprise: Tessa and Daynie Singh began trying for another baby three months after Cara was born, but did not count on falling pregnant on the first try

‘If it was going to take a year or so to 
fall pregnant, then we wanted to start trying straight away. I actually 
fell pregnant the first time we started trying, which was a bit of a 
surprise.’

The couple, who live in Chorlton, 
Manchester, were in for a further surprise when Mrs Singh went for a 
12-week scan and the sonographer told her she was expecting twins.

She
 said: ‘I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I was in complete shock. 
I’d had a lot more morning sickness with this pregnancy, but I had never
 imagined that I could be carrying twins. There are no twins in either 
side of our families.

‘I was
 actually offered counselling by the hospital after I’d found out. I 
think they thought that three babies in under nine months was a bit too 
much to cope with.

‘We discussed it and decided that it was daunting, but as long as we were organised, then we would be able to manage.’

Same, same, but different: The three Singh sisters have a very close bond, 'acting like triplets' and all sleeping in one bed

But in April 2009, when Mrs Singh was 27 weeks pregnant, she went into premature labour.

She said: ‘It was so frightening that 
the babies were on their way at such an early stage. We didn’t even know
 if they would survive. We really thought that we were going to lose 
them.’

Proud parents: Tessa and Daynie Singh

Doctors at Royal Oldham Infirmary 
managed to hold off the contractions for a week. Then the twins were 
delivered, each weighing only 2lbs. 

The
 girls were transferred to St Mary’s Hospital in Manchester. Jenna 
suffered two bleeds on the brain, had a hole in her heart and had a 
collapsed lung.

Mrs Singh said: ‘It was a terrifying time for us when 
the twins were first born. They were so tiny and so poorly. At one point
 we said goodbye to Jenna, but amazingly she managed to fight on.’

Jenna was diagnosed with cerebral palsy and the doctors warned Mrs Singh that she may never walk.

 But she has proved the medics wrong, something that Mrs Singh believes is down to her close relationship with her sisters.

She
 said: ‘They have such a strong bond. Cara was only nine months old when
 the twins were born, so she has never known life without them there.

‘It
 is as if they are all triplets. They are never apart from each other. 
She has just as strong a bond with the twins as they do with each other.
 They always want to sleep all together on one bed.’

‘Jenna
 has been helped so much by her sisters. It has given her the goal and 
incentives to keep up with them, which has helped her enormously.’

She added: ‘It may have been a shock to give birth to three babies in nine months, but I wouldn’t change it for the world.’

Mrs Singh is fundraising for Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust Charity. She has just completed the London Marathon to raise funds. For more information about the charity visit www.cmftcharity.org.uk
