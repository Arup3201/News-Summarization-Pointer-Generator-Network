One post about an alleged child abduction on a mothers' group on Facebook has spawned widespread panic across Sydney's Northern Beaches.

A member of Northern Beaches Mums' Group claims she saw a young girl - aged five or six years old - being taken from a bus shelter near Pittwater Golf Centre on Pittwater Road in Warriewood on Wednesday night.

She posted her sighting on the page, saying it happened about 10.30pm.

Urging people to be on the look out for anyone suspicious, the woman said the alleged offender was a man about 177cm tall who had dark hair, a moustache and was wearing black pants and a tracksuit top.

The incident was reported to police who followed it up but did not find anything to substantiate the claims.

But the post caused great alarm among the 6,000-plus members, with some driving through the streets in the Sydney suburb searching for the girl.

Less than an hour after the alert went out, the post had amassed more than 340 comments, Manly Daily reported.

The post caused widespread alarm but police have investigated the incident and saw there was no evidence to suggest it happened

Page founder Annika Coulson urged members not to post alleged crimes on social media but instead contact the police to ensure it was dealt with properly by the authorities.

'If you see a crime or something disturbing your first port of call is the police not Facebook,' Ms Coulson told News Corp. 

Northern beaches Local Area Command Acting Inspector Rob Winkler confirmed police had investigated the matter.

'[We] have not found any information to suggest there was an abduction,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'We would always urge people if they have witnessed a crime to contact police immediately.' 

Insp Winkler said police have asked the administrator to remove the post as it was causing concern among the mothers group.

Police have also said they had received phone calls from concerned citizens wanting to be updated on the situation.
