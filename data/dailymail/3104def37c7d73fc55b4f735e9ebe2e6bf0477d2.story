Newcastle have signed Karl Darlow and Jamaal Lascelles from Nottingham Forest for an undisclosed fee.

Centre-back Lascelles, 20, and goalkeeper Darlow, 23, will be loaned back to Forest this season with their wages being picked up by Newcastle.

Lascelles said: 'As soon as I found out about the move I was over the moon. It's a huge step up for me. Newcastle are a club with a massive fanbase, a big history and an unbelievable stadium.

'First, I am going back to Forest for another season and that will be great for my development. 

'Hopefully I can come here next summer an even better player.'

Loan: Both players return to Forest on loan  for the 2014/15 season with Newcastle paying their wages

Darlow has previously enjoyed loan spells at Newport County and Walsall but has been Forest's first choice keeper since January 2010.

He said: 'I'm delighted for it all to be sorted and I can't wait to get started here at Newcastle,' he said.

'The loan back is going to be another year but it gives me time to develop my game further before I return. I'm looking forward to the future.'

Newcastle boss Alan Pardew seemed delighted with the club's new acquisitions. 

He said: 'It is a real coup to have signed two of the finest young talents in English football outside of the Premier League.

'Jamaal and Karl will be a big part of the future of this Club. They have both performed outstandingly in the Championship over the last couple of years and I have no doubt they will be able step up to this level once they return from their loan at Nottingham Forest.'

Transfer: Jamaal Lascelles was actually the subject of a bid from Arsenal back in 2011

Forest's manager, however, was not so pleased with the deal.The former England U21 boss expressed his anger at the sale of the pair and claimed he knew little about it.

But Forest's chairman Fawaz Al-Hasawi said it was necessary to comply with Financial Fair Play. 

In a statement released on the club website, Al-Hawasi countered: 'The manager and I openly discussed the proposed sale of Karl and Jamaal and he was aware of the negotiations throughout. The business side of football is changing and the requirement to increase revenue means, unfortunately, difficult decisions have to be made.

'Should the pair's proposed move to Newcastle be completed as expected, the transfer fees will significantly help us meet the stringent Financial Fair Play criteria, all the while allowing us to retain two high-quality players for the 2014-15 season, paying nothing towards their wages.

'Sadly for me, there is no room for sentimentality in the running of a football club and it is up to me to start making some tough decisions to preserve the long-term sustainability of Nottingham Forest.

'But while balancing the books is a hugely significant part of my role, it remains my job to ensure the manager has the best possible squad to work with as we pursue a place in the Premier League.He added on Twitter shortly afterwards: 'Stuart and I work together as a team, and not work behind each other's backs to bring the best out of this club.'
