Fifteen people were hurt by flying glass and fish when a giant shark-filled aquarium exploded at a shopping mall yesterday.

Shoppers were hit when the 10inch thick protective glass gave way without warning in Shaghai, China, while other terrified passers by fled in panic.

The entrance to the Dongfang shopping mall was flooded and covered in glass when the 34-tonne casing suddenly shattered.

Destroyed: Glass shattered all over the shopping mall entrance after it burst without warning

Dangerous: The site was cordoned off by police and an investigation has been launched into the cause

Death: Three lemon sharks and dozens of smaller fish and turtles died when the tank exploded

Three lemon sharks and dozens of smaller fish and turtles died and police have launched an investigation.

One worker said: 'There was no warning. Just a loud crack and it went. I've never been so scared.'

Police said some people were seriously hurt by the thick glass and were taken to Changzheng Hospital with deep cuts.

The
 tank had become a local landmark since it was installed two years ago 
and every week a diver would swim with the sharks, feeding them by 
hand.Â 

A police 
spokesman said: 'There were lots of injuries caused by flying glass, 
some of them serious because the glass was so thick.

'We are investigating what caused this.'

Attraction: The tank has been popular since it was installed two years ago and people would flock to watch a diver feed the sharks by hand

Wrecked: The entire structure was destroyed when the tank burst

Injured: A man is treated after getting cut by glass. In total 15 people were hurt
