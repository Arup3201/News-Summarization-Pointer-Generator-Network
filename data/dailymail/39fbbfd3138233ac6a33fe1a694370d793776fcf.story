The classical piano from the triple Oscar winning film Casablanca will be auctioned off in New York in November and is expected to sell for at least $1 million.

The instrument will be one of over 30 items sold at Bonham's Auction House from the iconic 1942 World War II time romantic drama.

The 1942 Oscar Best Picture winner
 starring Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, and Paul Henreid and 
featuring Dooley Wilson among other notables, first employs the piano in
 a memorable scene between Bergman and Bogart in which Wilson sings, 'As Time Goes By.'

The key item: The piano used in the 1942 movie Casablanca to play 'As Time Goes By' is expected to sell at an auction in New York for at least $1 million

The scene: Humphrey Bogart leans on the soon to be auctioned piano Dooley Wilson is playing in a scene from the film Casablanca

Rick, played by Humphrey Bogart, storms over angrily having instructed Sam, played by Wilson, to never play that song again and is stunned to see his ex-lover Ilsa, played by Ingrid Bergman, at the bar with her husband, a fugitive leader of the Czech resistance.

The salmon-colored piano is expected to reach at least seven figures.

A different 58-key upright piano 
from a flashback scene between Bergman and Bogart was auctioned
 at Sotheby's in 2012 and sold for $602,500, below the estimated 
$800,000-$1.2 million that Sotheby's predicted.

Casablanca took home three Oscars in 1943 for Best Picture, Best Screenplay, and Best Director.

The piano is one of the over 30 items from the film which 
also include the doors of Rick's Cafe America 
along with a final draft of the screenplay, signed cast photos, and 
passports created for the characters in the film.

Showstopper: The piano from the memorable scene in which Dooly Wilson plays 'As Time Goes By' will go on sale at Bonham's Auction House in New York in November

All of the items for sale belong to a single private collector.

The
 sale will also have items from other films including a pinafore and a 
test dress originally designed for Judy Garland for her performance in 
the film 'The Wizard of Oz.'

All
 of the items will be on display in preview exhibitions in Los Angeles 
from November 6 -November 9 and in New York from November 20 to November
 24.

'Bonham’s
 is thrilled to represent this remarkable Casablanca collection, 
certainly one of the most significant film memorabilia collections still
 in private hands,' said the director of Entertainment Memorabilia at 
Bonham’s, Catherine Williamson.

Would a piano by any another name sound as sweet?: Dooley Wilson, Humphrey Bogart, and Ingrid Bergman are pictured with a different piano from a flashback scene from Casablanca that sold at Sotheby's in 2012
