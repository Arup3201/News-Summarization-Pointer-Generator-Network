It will certainly make a dent in your holiday budget.

As well as world-class clubs and luxury villas, the party island of Ibiza is soon to be home to the most expensive restaurant on the planet.

The new Hard Rock Hotel, opening in Playa d'en Bossa on May 18, will be launching Sublimotion - an ‘unparalleled gastro-sensory venture’ where a 20-course meal will set diners back £1,235 a head.

Michelin-starred chef Paco Roncero is behind the five-star resort’s exclusive concept, which aims to take 12 guests at a time ‘an experience for all the senses’.

Combining food, art and technology, the menu, which is yet to be unveiled, promises to create a ‘complete and unprecedented emotional experience’ at the first Hard Rock Hotel to open in Europe.

A spokesman explained: ‘The dishes will cause a stir among the most neglected senses; from moments of humour, pleasure, fear, reflection and nostalgia, diners will be wandering through a world of sensations from the North Pole where they will enjoy a cold snack that they carve on their own iceberg or to the baroque Versailles where the elegance of a rose is sure to melt in their palate.’
