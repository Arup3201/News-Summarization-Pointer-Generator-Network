Manchester United's shocking demise has become even more stark as Sportsmail can reveal that a whopping six of the side to beat Arsenal 8-2 three years ago starting in the troubling draw away at Sunderland last week.

Phil Jones, Chris Smalling, Ashley Young, Tom Cleverley, Wayne Rooney and David de Gea all lined up at the Stadium of Light on Sunday ahead of another afternoon to lay bare the problems facing the club after Sir Alex Ferguson's departure.

The Scot has been heavily criticised for the way in which he spent money towards the end of his tenure - Jones, Smalling, Anderson, Nani and Young have all been pinned up as poster boys for a flailing transfer policy.

Those were better times! Manchester United beat Arsenal 8-2 three years ago this weekend

Spot the difference! There were just five changes between the game against Arsenal and Sunderland last week

Three and easy! Wayne Rooney netted a hat-trick against Arsenal at Old Trafford three years ago

Tricky business: New manager Louis van Gaal knows all about the problems he faces

Tens of millions were splashed out on the quartet, among others, as Ferguson set about building what he thought would be an empire for the decade to come. 

That, with the power of hindsight, hasn’t exactly materialised - all too apparent on Wearside and during the opening day defeat by Swansea before it.

Since the Scot’s retirement in 2013, United’s fortunes have taken a complete nosedive. David Moyes came and went in less than 12 months while Louis van Gaal is struggling to get to grips with a largely incompetent squad.

It was a scandalous seventh-place finish under Moyes last season, with no European football, that led to the overwhelming need for change and the feeling that this is a club in need of a mammoth overhaul. Moyes knew it; Van Gaal is all too aware.

Anderson is ready to be shipped out of Old Trafford should a suitor be willing to pay his wages, while Nani is at Sporting Lisbon and question marks still loom large over Young.

But do not forget that this pair also played in the thumping win against Arsenal. Danny Welbeck played up front in each. Javier Hernandez was a substitute, too.

Trouble: David Moyes wasn't afforded the opportunity to sign big names during his time at the club

And then the problems began: Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement rocked United to their core

And those six starters were all on Van Gaal's teamsheet as they stumbled to a 1-1 draw at Sunderland last weekend.

That shines a rather bright light on the remarkable change in fortunes around Carrington and poses questions as to what has actually happened.

The players Ferguson spent huge sums on – and those youngsters he placed faith in from their teens – were the ones to demolish Arsene Wenger’s side 36 months ago.

Rooney netted a hat-trick, Young got two, Welbeck opened the scoring and even Nani notched. That was a team at the peak of its powers.

Admittedly this was a dismal Arsene outfit – their lowest point during Wenger’s reign – but Ferguson’s young guns still finished them off. Robin van Persie, Theo Walcott and Laurent Koscielny could only stand and watch.

Whipped: Ashley Young scored a stunning goal against Arsenal to put the champions two ahead

A happier time: Young's stock has fallen dramatically over the course of the last three seasons 

The old saying is that players do not become bad ones overnight. Cleverley is being chased by Valencia, who know a good ball player when they see one, while Nani has been deemed good enough for the Champions League this term.

Fatal for United is that they stood still, perhaps even became complacent, with Ferguson in charge – trophies were still being won, there appeared no end to their dominance – and they’ve been unable to deal with clear deficiencies since.

Cleverley and Anderson had both gone backwards, through injury and loss of confidence, but Moyes suffered at the hands of Ed Woodward's incompetence in going out and failing to sign a quality central midfielder. They wanted Cesc Fabregas and failed, ending up with the overpriced Marouane Fellaini who – putting it mildly - has flattered to deceive.

They have moved to sign players in areas that didn’t warrant it – see the £60million Angel di Maria as a frame of reference just this week – and were left with a crèche of a back three against Sunderland. Patrice Evra and Rio Ferdinand's absence is become ever more glaring as the weeks float by. 

It really is hard to believe that most of the same players to shrink on Wearside beat everything put in front of them three years ago; Ferguson's spending wasn't to blame, it's what was done with them after that was the main problem.
