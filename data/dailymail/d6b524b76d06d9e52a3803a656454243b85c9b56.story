Over: Freud, 50, and Ms Murdoch, 46, who have two children, are expected to be granted a decree nisi this week. Above, the couple  together last year

The 13-year marriage of public relations guru Matthew Freud and Rupert Murdoch’s daughter Elisabeth has ended – less than a year after a family feud over Tony Blair’s relationship with Murdoch’s ex-wife, Wendi Deng.

Freud, 50, and Ms Murdoch, 46, who have two children, are expected to be granted a decree nisi this week. 

The precise cause of the breakdown is not known, but well-placed sources say a long-running row between Freud and his media mogul father-in-law was a factor. One source described a ‘war of attrition’ between the two men.

Elisabeth got caught in the crossfire when her husband sided with Blair after her father filed for divorce from Ms Deng after her reported ‘crush’ on the former Prime Minister and his discovery that the pair had spent weekends together without his knowledge.

The Freuds – who are worth £250 million between them – have been dubbed ‘the ultimate media couple’. He grew his publicity business by advising everyone from the Department of Health to Spice Girl Geri Halliwell – while she founded the TV production company Shine, whose programmes include MasterChef.

Their 22-bedroom Oxfordshire country home Burford Priory was once seen as the unofficial social headquarters of the Chipping Norton set, which included David and Samantha Cameron, former Sun editor Rebekah Brooks and Top Gear’s Jeremy Clarkson.

Freud has also been close to Tony Blair since before he became Prime Minister – a friendship which has caused conflict with his father-in-law.

Murdoch accused Freud of cultivating Ms Deng to deliberately antagonise him, and of sending him ‘crazy 3am emails’ making wild allegations.

Murdoch was furious when Freud, great-grandson of Sigmund Freud, the pioneer of psychoanalysis, banned him from his 50th birthday party last year at which Tony and Cherie Blair were star guests.

The first public sign that the Freuds’ marriage was on the rocks came in July this year when Blair threw a 60th birthday party for Cherie at their home in Buckinghamshire, attended by high-profile figures from politics, the media and showbusiness. 

The Freuds were assigned seats at Cherie’s top table but failed to turn up, leaving two starkly empty spaces. They also holidayed separately on different boats in the Mediterranean: Ms Murdoch with an old girlfriend, Freud apparently unaccompanied.

A family friend said last night: ‘Matthew and Elisabeth were deeply in love but no couple could survive the emotional pressures they have been under in recent years.’

They met in 1997, when Elisabeth had been married for four years to Elkin Kwesi Pianim, a financier of Ghanaian origin, and was pregnant with his second child. Freud was married to Caroline Hutton – known as ‘Pidge’ – with whom he already had two sons. Ms Hutton, who was devastated by the break-up, went on to marry the 9th Earl Spencer, brother of Diana, Princess of Wales.

The Freuds’ courtship was passionate. When former New Yorker editor Tina Brown hosted a restaurant dinner for them in London, a guest recalled them being ‘all over each other’ – and so keen to leave together that the supper came to an abrupt conclusion.

But in 2000, after Ms Murdoch had given birth to her and Freud’s first child, Charlotte Emma, the couple briefly separated, plunging Freud into a deep gloom which only lifted when they were re-united in 2001. They married at Blenheim Palace that year and went on to have a second child, Samson, now seven.

Also in 2001, Ms Murdoch founded Shine which has since expanded into a multi-million-pound TV company, taking over other outfits such as Kudos, makers of Spooks and Broadchurch.

Freud is the son of former Liberal MP Sir Clement Freud, and the brother of the radio presenter Emma, who is married to Love Actually director Richard Curtis. His uncle was the late painter Lucian Freud, and his cousins are the novelist Esther and designer Bella.

After leaving Westminster School, he became a press officer for the RCA record label and by the age of 20 he was running his own company from a small flat in West London. Now called Freud Communications, it is worth £100 million and advises firms including Walkers Crisps and KFC. He became a member of Blair’s inner circle, especially close to Peter Mandelson who appointed him to work on the Millennium Dome.

But Freud’s dealings with Rupert Murdoch have been described as ‘wary’ from the outset. According to one account, Murdoch ‘kept him at arm’s length’ for the first two years of his relationship with his daughter, before reluctantly agreeing to work with him on a minor project.

Tension between the pair burst into the open in 2010 when Freud launched an outspoken attack on Roger Ailes, the boss of Fox News, the Right-wing US TV network owned by Murdoch’s News Corporation and one of Murdoch’s closest personal and business allies. Freud accused Fox News of an ‘horrendous and sustained disregard of the journalistic standards that News Corps, its founder and every other global media business aspires to’.

According to some reports Freud was reportedly encouraged by Ms Deng and Elisabeth to attack Ailes as part of a family power struggle over the future of News Corps.

It prompted a withering response by Ailes who said: ‘I was told Sigmund Freud had a vasectomy in 1927 – obviously not soon enough.’

But relations between Freud and his 83-year-old father-in-law finally disintegrated in the aftermath of Mr Murdoch’s discovery of Blair’s relationship with Ms Deng. The Mail on Sunday revealed last November how the former Prime Minister’s meetings with Ms Deng at Murdoch’s US homes and a note suggesting she had a ‘crush’ on him were key factors in his decision to file for divorce.

Friends of Blair have always insisted there was no affair. And when Freud backed Blair, it led to a tit-for-tat war with Murdoch, climaxing with Freud banning his father-in-law from his 50th birthday party at Burford Priory, but inviting the Blairs.

Power couple: Their 22-bedroom Oxfordshire country home Burford Priory was once seen as the unofficial social headquarters of the Chipping Norton set, which included David and Samantha Cameron.

The ban came after Murdoch similarly snubbed Blair by banning him from a US media summit.

Murdoch revealed his hurt at the 50th party rebuff via a source who said at the time: ‘Rupert is particularly upset that Matthew and Elisabeth held a party at exactly the time when rumours were circulating about Wendi and Blair. Rupert wasn’t invited but Blair was. That was a very public V-sign to Rupert.’

The source added: ‘Freud has been sending crazy 3am emails to Rupert making all sorts of accusations. Elisabeth is stuck in the middle and it has had a devastating effect on her relations with Rupert.’

The extent to which Elisabeth had become dragged into the battle was painfully clear in an extraordinary, and in hindsight, pointed statement issued by Freud. As the war of words intensified, he said last December: ‘I will be eternally grateful to Rupert Murdoch for producing Elisabeth, who is practically perfect in every way. 

On the rocks: Elisabeth was recently seen out without her wedding ring. The first public sign that her marriage was in trouble came in July this year

'Our views differ quite dramatically on a number of subjects professionally and I regret that this has caused my relationship with him to be sometimes conflicted.

‘But we have had good times as well as bad times, we both love his daughter and his grandchildren, if not always each other. I do not believe anything else is terribly important.’

His ‘not always each other’ aside about Murdoch underlined the depth of animosity between them. His declaration of love for ‘practically perfect’ Elisabeth suggests he was committed to his marriage.

Murdoch has rarely talked about his warring family or his relations with Elisabeth. However, in July, in a cryptic tweet, he wrote: ‘Asked is my daughter friend of David Cameron? Don’t know, but hope not. Really not my business.’

Freud has been fiercely protective of his wife. When the London Evening Standard wrote a front-page story in 2011 about her selling Shine to her father’s 21st Century Fox for £415 million, giving her a personal profit of £130 million, Freud was so angry about the ‘Sold to Daddy’ headline, he threw a glass of wine over editor Geordie Greig (now editor of The Mail on Sunday), at a party.

Last week it was announced that Ms Murdoch was preparing to stand down from Shine after 21st Century Fox said that it would merge it with companies including Endemol, the makers of Big Brother.

The wine incident was not Freud’s only hot-headed social outburst. In 2010 he was at Annabel’s nightclub in Mayfair when actor Hugh Grant was asked if he would like to meet Freud – even though they had a history going back 20 years.

Grant declined and is said to have used an expletive about Freud. The PR guru, who was within earshot, then smeared chocolate cake down Grant’s shirt, and Grant punched Freud in the face.

Despite such occasional volatile outbursts, Freud is undoubtedly generous. Friends say that when first wife ‘Pidge’ broke up with Charles Spencer, Freud was ‘highly supportive’. They say he is a devoted father to the children he shares with both ‘Pidge’ and Elisabeth.

Freud made his fortune from providing crisis management to the rich and famous. But his skills do not appear to extend to resolving crises in his own marriage.
