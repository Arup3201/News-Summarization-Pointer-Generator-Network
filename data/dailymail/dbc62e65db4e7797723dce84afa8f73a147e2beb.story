The Pope married 20 couples today, several with children out of wedlock, in the latest demonstration of his more laissez-faire attitude to Catholic teaching. 

In an extremely rare celebration, Pope Francis presided over the vows of couples who some traditionalists would say were living 'in sin'.

The last time a pope performed a marriage was St John Paul II, who wed 16 people at a Mass to mark the Jubilee for Families in October 2000.

Today, Francis took each couple through their vows in turn - including Gabriella Improta and Guido Tassara, who already had children and
thought such a marriage would be impossible, Radio Vaticana reports.

The diocese of Rome had earlier candidly stated: 'The people getting married on Sunday are couples like many
others. Some already
live together, some already have children.' 

Francis, the first non-European pope in 1,300 years,
has shown extreme tolerance in relation to subjects traditionally taboo in the Church.

He recently claimed that the Church must end its obsession with teachings on abortion, contraception and homosexuality, and become more merciful or risk collapsing 'like a house of cards'.

Speaking about gay people, he once asked 'who am I to judge' someone 'who seeks God and has good will?'.

His liberal approach bears stark contrast with that of his predecessor, the
German Pope Benedict, who said that threats to the traditional
family undermined the future of humanity itself.

Francis' latest step will be a boost for those hoping he proposes liberal reforms at a major Vatican conference on sexual and family relationships next month.

Many have already been encouraged by signs that the Argentine has a more progressive attitude to issues such as homosexuality. 

He has even asked the Curia to look into the recognition of civil same sex unions.

But the Vatican have continued to endorse heterosexual marriage and procreation as God's command.

The Synod of Bishops will review Catholic practices on the family and - it is hoped - will decide how to adapt to today's rapidly changing norms while keeping fidelity with the faith. 

Bishops from around the world will be at next month's meeting on the family, which Francis referred to in today's ceremony 'bricks' on which society is built.

Issues such as marriage,
divorce and contraception will also be discussed.

In June, the pope celebrated Mass at the chapel in his Santa Marta residence with 15 couples that were marking 25 to 60 years of marriage.

During the service, he said the pillars of a successful marriage were fidelity, perseverance and fertility, but made headlines around the world when he urged couples not to replace children with cats and dogs.

He said: 'It might be better — more comfortable — to have a dog, two cats, and the love goes to the two cats and the dog. Is this true or not? Have you seen it?

'Then, in the end this marriage comes to old age in solitude, with the bitterness of loneliness.'
