It's the time of year when inevitably some ambitious people decide to ignore the High Street in favour of making their Christmas gifts.

Armed with glitter, glue and hope, people will attempt a festive craft project to adorn their homes or present as a gift to their loved ones - but rarely does it go right.

But for every successful attempt, there are hundreds of frustrated shrieks as people see their crafts collapse into a complete mess.

What should have been a simple reindeer-themed snack resulted in Rudolph's face looking like it had melted

Birds of a feather fail together: These sweet birds may look like they are happy to see you - but would you be happy to eat them?

And you thought your Christmas jumper was bad: This woman decided to festoon a perfectly good top with some tinsel to make it extra festive

Unfortunately it didn't quite turn out how the original picture promised...

Such is the failure rate, websites devoted to failed craft projects have become hugely popular on the internet - with people clamouring to share pictures of the appalling state of their work.

Heather Mann, creator of the Craft Fail website, said that she was inspired to create her website - which showcases DIY disasters - after she found her own failures hilarious.

She said: 'As a craft designer and blogger, I make a lot of things, and not all of them turn out well enough to share on my website.

'One day it occurred to me how entertaining it would be if I could share the failures on a dedicated website, thus CraftFail.com was born.

Bird brain: These turkey cake pops look like the bird has been run over - but at least its beak is in tact

Birds of a feather fail together: These sweet birds may look like they are happy to see you - but would you be happy to eat them?

'Now I'm actually excited when a project doesn't turn out! I love sharing my failed crafts even more than my successful ones.'

Pity the poor person who attempted some seasonal-themed baking.

Delicate star-shaped cookies bloomed into huge blobs, while an attempt to make reindeer treats meant that the results looked like Santa's helpers faces had melted.

Another person attempted to make their own Christmas baubles; but the result looked like glass balls filled with slime.

These snowmen look like they have been placed in front of the fire: These snowmen-shaped doughnut cakes may taste nice - but they don't look appetising

Would you want these dangling from your tree? A misguided attempt to decorate glass baubles ended up looking like balls of slime

They were meant to be stars! These biscuit blobs were initially intended to be delicate star-shaped treats

Ms Mann said that websites like Pinterest, which boast perfect craft projects, can be daunting for the novice crafter.

She said: 'Some of the projects are just 
as easy as the pins on Pinterest claim. Some of them aren't as easy, and
 take some practice.

'You won't always nail every project on the first try; a lot of success relies on previous experience.

'If you don't have that experience, you might not succeed on the first try.

This takes the biscuit: These turkey cookies don't quite live up to the original project

Who wold live in a house like this? This monstrous attempt is a far cry from the polished version that Martha Stewart made

'People should not be so hard on themselves if they are beginners to a certain type of project.

'You can't expect to be a professional on the first try if you've never even picked up a sewing needle before!

'Babies can't walk on the day they are born, and adults aren't always going to be successful with a new technique on the first day they try it.

'Also, be aware that bloggers and magazines know how to 'style' their photos to look especially attractive and tempting.

'Your project might turn out just as well as theirs, but it won't be surrounded by a perfectly arranged background.'
