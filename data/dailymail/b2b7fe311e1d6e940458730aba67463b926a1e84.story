Antony Breeze with his partner Amanda Lowe. An inquest heard how Mr Breeze, 36, of Horwich, Bolton,  set himself on fire after getting into debt with payday loan firms

A debt-ridden father doused himself in
 petrol and turned himself into a human fireball after being harassed 
for money by payday loan firms.

Antony Breeze, 36, died after setting himself alight, telling passers-by who tried to extinguish the flames: ‘I’ve had enough.’

In the hours before the tragedy Mr 
Breeze, who owed around £1,600, was bombarded with text messages about 
his arrears, an inquest heard.

The next day he went out, telling his 
girlfriend he was getting petrol for a lawnmower.

Minutes later he was 
found screaming and in flames on a pathway.

He had been so worried about the debts that he lost a stone in weight in just two weeks, relatives said.

Mr Breeze and his partner of nine years, Amanda Lowe, had a six-year-old daughter, Amy, and were planning to marry.

Police investigating his death found 
he owed money to several lenders, including Keyes Whitlock and Co, 
Mobile Money Ltd, 247 Moneybox.com, Cash Genie and Valour Loans.

Miss Lowe said that the night before 
he died on August 3 last year he had received a stream of calls and 
texts from loan firms, although he refused to tell her which ones were 
pestering him.

She added: ‘He had calls all night on 
Thursday, his phone never stopped ringing, he wouldn’t tell me who it 
was.

'He went into the bathroom.’

The next day Mr Breeze played with Amy before going to withdraw £30 from a cash machine.

He then went out again, telling Miss Lowe he was getting fuel for her father’s mower.

While he was gone she called him to 
ask when he would be home.

She added: ‘He said he was going for a walk 
to clear his head. I didn’t ask what was wrong.’

Mr Breeze bought £3 of petrol in a can
 from a Texaco garage before walking to a secluded track. Fifteen 
minutes later, electrician Paul Tunnah heard screams as Mr Breeze 
emerged in a fireball.

The death of Antony Breeze comes at a time of intense criticism of the payday loans industry.

Last week two payday lenders were ordered to surrender their trading licences after a crackdown by the Office of Fair Trading.

The
 OFT said that it is also currently investigating three more payday 
loans firms for bad business practices and they too could be shut down. 
The OFT could not name them for legal reasons.

The
 Payday Loan Company Limited – which operates under a number of names 
including Cashnet and Paydayloans.co.uk - and Anfield Cheque Cashing 
Centre have both given up their consumer credit licences and will no 
longer be able to trade.

Last month the consumer body sent letters to 50 leading payday lenders asking them to take
 immediate action to overhaul their businesses.

The
 OFT accused firms of failing to conduct adequate assessments to see if 
applicants can afford loans, failing to explain how payments will be 
collected, aggressive debt collection techniques and not treating 
borrowers with sensitivity and patience.

The Citizens Advice Bureau has also 
accused lenders of pushing people into debt by failing to check that 
borrowers can afford to repay loan.

In
 a survey of 1,270 payday loan borrowers, with loans from 87 payday 
lenders, 65 per cent of people did not get asked about their financial 
situation when taking it out, according to research by the CAB.

Mr Tunnah, who was seriously burned trying to save Mr Breeze, said: ‘I took my top off to try put out the flames.

‘He was conscious throughout, from when I first saw him to leaving in the ambulance.

‘I asked him what had happened and he 
said, “I’ve had enough. I’m in debt and poured petrol over myself”.

'He 
did say he wanted to see his daughter, but I said it would be cruel – at
 this stage he was unrecognisable.’

Mr Breeze was taken to hospital but died hours later from 73 per cent burns.

The inquest in Bolton heard that loan firms then wrote to his father asking for his debts to be repaid.

Miss Lowe, from Horwich, told the 
hearing the couple had argued during the week before the tragedy, but 
had resolved their problems.

Last night his family said Mr Breeze had 
also been worried that he might lose his job as a driver for an 
engineering firm.

His sister, Caroline Hedley, said: ‘He worked very hard. He worked six days a week.’

But she added that he would often borrow money when he struggled to make ends meet.

Some debts were paid off by Miss 
Lowe’s father and Mr Breeze is thought to have seen a debt counsellor.

Recording an open verdict, deputy coroner Alan Walsh said: ‘He worked 
hard and provided for his family.

'But he worried about the finances of 
the family.’

The news comes a week after the Office
 of Fair Trading told two payday lenders to surrender their trading 
licences.

It is also investigating three others for bad business 
practices and has written to 50 payday lenders telling them to overhaul 
their practices.
