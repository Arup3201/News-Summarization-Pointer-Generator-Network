Epsom has confirmed that the start of this year’s Investec Derby on June 6 will be pushed back by half an hour in an effort to halt the alarming slump in viewing figures.

The plan for a 4.30pm fifth-race slot with the meeting also starting at the later time of 2pm was revealed by Sportsmail in October amid speculation that the track and sponsors were even considering an evening start for the biggest Flat race of the British season.

Such a move was not an option this summer with the Champions League final also rostered for June 6.

The need for Buckingham Palace approval with attendance of the Queen being regarded as crucial plus the potential of spiralling police costs are likely to have been other factors for that idea being parked, at least for time being.

But Epsom supremo Rupert Trevelyan made it clear that an evening Derby has not completely been removed from the agenda when he said: ’At this stage this is the extent of our changes to race times but we will review following the 2015 Investec Derby Festival.’

That will heap the pressure on Channel 4 and Stephen Lyle, their new Commissioning Editor for Sport, whose appointment was announced on Wednesday.

Lyle, currently Series Editor of BBC Match of the Day 2 and Programme Editor on Match of the Day, is faced with 2014 figures showing year-on-year falls in peak audience (1.55million compared to 1.95m), audience share (14.7 per cent compared to 21.8 per cent) and average audience (770,000 compared to 834,000).

With an half-hour later start time hardly have a seismic effect, the emphasis will be on Channel 4 to draw in viewers with the sort of promotional push they have previously concentrated on the Cheltenham Festival.

That meeting looks like it has lost another big name with news that Jonjo O'Neill’s 2014 Ladbroke World Hurdle winner More Of That broke a blood vessel during a piece of work under AP McCoy on Wednesday morning.

O’Neill described the gelding’s participation at the Festival as ‘unlikely’.

More Of That had been expected to be one of McCoy’s best chances at his last Festival.

He had undergone treatment for a breathing issue since finishing a disappointing third to Medinas in the Long Distance Hurdle at Newbury in November but was still 5-2 favourite to retain his title. Ladbrokes have suspended betting on the race.

O’Neill and McCoy, successful with Sebastian Beach at Chepstow, will be hoping for better news when Gold Cup contender Holywell tries put a couple of tame efforts behind him in the Ivan Straker Memorial Chase at Kelso on Thursday.

Meanwhile, trainer Oliver Sherwood claimed his 1,000th career win with Financial Climate at Chepstow.
