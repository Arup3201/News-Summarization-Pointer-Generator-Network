A white hat, black jacket and a bomb were all found in the college dorm room of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the youngest Boston bomber suspect.

The FBI searched the second year medical student's room at the University of Massachusetts in Dartmouth on Sunday following his capture on Saturday.

The 19-year-old was formally charged yesterday with using 'weapons of mass destruction' after the twin bombings on 15 April which killed three people and injured more than 180 at the Boston marathon.

Evidence: Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev, 19 left, and his 26-year-old brother, Tamerlan Tzarnaev, right. The FBI found 'a black jacket and a white hat of the same general appearance as those worn by Bomber Two at the Boston Marathon'

Residence: Students stand outside the Pine Dale Hall dormitory that Dzhokhar Tsamaev lived in that was searched by authorities

Reveal: The charging documents reveal dramatic new details of the investigation and events following the bombings, including a list of items obtained from Tsarnaev's college dorm room

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev rented a double room in  Pine Dale Hall, a sophomore residence in the leafy campus of University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth.

It came with cable television and internet.

Opened in September 2002, Pine Dale Hall offers students the classic hallway style of living with student rooms directly off the main hallway.

The building has four floors with 208 double rooms and is equipped with 2 elevators for student use. There are no single rooms in the building.

here are 2 full bathrooms in each area.

Each living area has a lounge/study area equipped with a TV, couches, and table/chairs. There is a kitchenette and laundry room located on the first floor.

In addition, there are 2 meetings rooms available to students which require advanced reservations to use.

The charging documents reveal dramatic new details of the investigation and events following the bombings, including a list of items obtained from Tsarnaev's college dorm room.

They stated they found a 'large pyrotechnic' in room 7341 on the campus’s Pine Dale dormitory.

They also found 'a black 
jacket and a white hat of the same general appearance as those worn by 
Bomber Two at the Boston Marathon.'

The sophomore had a double room at Pine Dall Hall.

It came with an interne port, telephone line and cable tv.

The four storey block has a living area/study space for residents and a kitchenette and laundry on the first floor.

The younger Tsarnaev was captured alive 
following a massive manhunt involving hundreds of law enforcement 
officials.

He was eventually discovered hiding in a boat parked outside a
home in Watertown, Mass.

Tsaernaev,
who was born in Russia, is in serious condition with gunshot wounds to 
his leg and his neck, the latter of which has left him unable to speak, 
according to hospital officials.

He remains under heavy guard while he receives treatment for his injuries.

His older brother and suspected 
accomplice in the bombings, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was killed during a 
firefight with police early Friday morning.

His fellow students at the prestigious university revealed he talked to multiple college friends about
the Boston Marathon attack just a day after he allegedly planted the 
explosive that killed an eight-year-old boy and maimed dozens more.

Calm: Sophomore Zach Bettencourt, right, 
recalled Tsarnaev, left, telling him on Tuesday evening: 'It's crazy 
this is happening now. This is so easy to do. These tragedies happen all
the time in Afghanistan and Iraq

'Yeah, man 
tragedies can happen anywhere in the world. It's too bad,' he told one 
friend at the gym on the campus of the University of Massachusetts at 
Dartmouth, according to CNN.

The student, who was not named, told the cable network that 19-year-old Dzhokhar seemed 'tired' but otherwise 'fine.'

Another student reported similar behavior from the suspect.

Fellow Dartmouth 
student Andrew Glasby said that Tsarnaev, lived one floor above him at the campus’s Pine Dale 
dormitory.

Glasby said that Tsarnaev had even offered to give him a ride home to Waltham, Massachusetts, on Friday

Glasby
said he spoke with the bombing suspect on the campus 24 hours after the
marathon explosions became a national terror and was surprised by 
Tsarneav’s calmness in hindsight.

'I can't believe he had the balls to come back and act like nothing happened,' Glasby said.

Sophomore
Zach Bettencourt recalled Tsarnaev telling him on Tuesday evening: 
'It's crazy this is happening now. This is so easy to do. These 
tragedies happen all the time in Afghanistan and Iraq.'

As pictures of the suspects, released by the FBI, flashed onto a television screen being watched by a group of 
students at Tsarnaev's dorm, Pine Dale Hall, Bettencourt said he and friends were stunned to 
realize one of the wanted men might be Tsarnaev.

Student: The 19-year-old was a medical student in a Massachusetts university where he had numerous friend

'We all thought it looked like him,' said Bettencourt, 20, of Gloucester, Massachusetts. 'We didn't believe it was him.'

The group of students wondered aloud if they should walk downstairs and knock on Tsarnaev's dorm room door.

'What if he had a gun?' Bettencourt said.

A school spokesman 
declined to say whether at that point on Thursday Tsarnaev was still on 
campus, about 60 miles south of Boston.

Just as disturbing, said Bettencourt, was the casual way Tsarnaev chatted about the bombings during his gym workout.

'I don't know how 
he talked about it. I don't know what was going on in his head,' 
Bettencourt said. 'I was driving here and thinking "Wow, he actually did
it."'

The unnamed student who spoke to ABC
said that Tsarnaev, who was often referred to as Jahar, said blended 
right back into normal college life and was 'convinced' that nothing 
was off about him.

'I
thought as it was just regular old Jahar. We had a typical 
conversation, he was not startled, he was not scared, he was not 
anything. He was just the same old Jahar,' he said.

Glasby said that Tsarnaev had even offered to give him a ride home to Waltham, Massachusetts, on Friday.

Wounded: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, seen here moments after he was pulled from the boat where he was hiding, suffered a throat wound and a leg wound

But instead, Glasby spent Friday evacuating the campus, which is about an hour’s drive south of Boston.

A
blaring university fire alarm woke Glasby that morning at around 10 am 
as Blackhawk helicopters circled overhead, according to ABC.

'I didn't have time to grab my wallet or my phone. I only had time to grab my sweatpants and my sneakers,' Glasby said.

Glasby
described Tsarnaev as a regular student who played soccer, enjoyed FIFA
soccer video games and frequently smoked marijuana until this year.

'The word that I've
heard everybody use is "surreal,"' said a college official helping 
students settle back onto the leafy campus of 9,400 students.

Yesterday Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was read his Miranda Rights as he was charged with using weapons of
mass destruction during an arraignment while he laid in his hospital 
bed.

During the 
proceedings at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Tsarnaev only 
uttered the word 'no' when asked if he could afford a defense attorney.

He was officially read his Miranda Rights at the time was he was arraigned on Monday by a magistrate judge, court officials said.

He was also asked several questions in which he nodded his head to respond.

A probable cause hearing in the case was then set for May 30.

He is specifically charged with one 
count of using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction - 
namely, an improvised explosive device or IED - against persons and 
property within the United States resulting in death, and one count of 
malicious destruction of property by means of an explosive device 
resulting in death, according to the criminal complaint.

If he is convicted, he faces a penalty of death or imprisonment for life.

He will not be tried as an enemy 
combatant because he is a naturalized U.S. citizen and under federal 
law, citizens cannot be tried in military commissions, the White House 
said Monday. Instead, he will be tried in the U.S. justice system.
