Alessandro del Piero, David Trezeguet, Robert Pires, Freddie Ljungberg, Nicolas Anelka - not so long ago these would be names any Premier League club would be keen to boast in their ranks, but now they're heading for a new league: in India.

The brand new Indian Super League begins next month with a host of football's great and good heading for Asia to take part - and bosses hope it will rival crickets Indian Premier League for the public's attention.

They're calling it 'football on steroids' and the 10-week league is all but ready for kick-off on October 12.

Excitement: The owners of the eight clubs, or franchises, pose at the launch of the new tournament

Bring it on: Those who have invested in the league believe that it can have a big impact in India

Star of the show: Alessandro del Piero is heading to India to take part in the new league

Baller: David Trezeguet might be in his twilight years but he too is heading to play in India's new league

Top class experience: Peter Reid has been drafted in to manage one of the teams - Mumbai FC

David James - Kerala Blasters

Alessandro del Piero - Delhi Dynamos

David James - FC Goa

Freddie Ljungberg and Nicolas Anelka - Mumbai City FC

Joan Capdevila - NorthEast United

David Trezeguet - FC Pune City

Luis Garcia - Atletico de Kolkata

The league has been designed to suit it's stars - they're all thought to be on big money and the season lasts just 10 weeks.

And it isn't just the players who are big names investing their time in the league. Sachin Tendulkar owns the Kerala Blasters and it is hoped his presence might reel in those cricket fans from across the country with games live on Indian television.

They're even bringing in star managers - former Manchester City and Sunderland manager Peter Reid will be managing Ljungberg at Mumbai City FC while Steve Clarke has been lined up to take over at FC Goa. 

Getting on: David James will also be playing in India - this picture shows him in a Hillsborough charity match

Ghost goal: Luis Garcia, shown here during his time at Liverpool, will be running down the flanks

Classy: Robert Pires is another who has put pen to paper to agree to play in the Indian Super League

'It's a great opportunity to coach in the Indian Super League. I enjoyed working overseas with Thailand and am very much looking forward to this new challenge,' Reid said.

He will also be managing Nicolas Anelka, who agreed to join Mumbai on Saturday. Anelka and Ljungberg are set to play together for the first time since 1999 with Arsenal.

And the league bosses want to establish themselves both as a rival to the IPL and the top footballing leagues in Europe.

'Right now the Indian teams are like school teams. With good coaches and more money, they should get better, but it will take many years to get to world level,' All India Football Federation president Praful Patel told The Times.

'Look at what IPL has done for cricket,' he said. 'The world now comes to India because of the huge viewing figures and the money. We hope to do the same eventually for football.'
