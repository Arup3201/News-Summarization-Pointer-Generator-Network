The vase sold for 100 times its estimated value after a telephone bidder in China took an interest in it

A small Chinese vase that was valued at £10,000 to £15,000 has today sold at auction - for almost £1 million.

The extremely rare 18th Century ornament, made for a Chinese emperor, was brought to Britain by the seller’s family more than a century ago.

Despite it standing just 20cm (eight inches) high, an anonymous telephone buyer from China paid around 100 times its estimated value when it went under the hammer at Tennants’ auction rooms in Leyburn, North Yorkshire today.

Tennants’ associate director, Nigel Smith said the blue and white bottle vase, made for the Qianlong Emperor around 1730, was put up for sale by an academic who lives in Oxford.

He said its auction room success was down to its rarity and exclusivity as very few were ever produced.

Mr Smith added: 'It really is a museum-quality piece and these things very rarely come on the market.

'It’s come down through the family - one of their relatives was a diplomat in China in the 1880s and was given it as a gift.'

He said the unnamed owner had contacted auctioneers after learning that a similar item had sold for £2.6 million last year.

Mr Smith said he was shocked at the £950,000 it made during today’s Spring Fine Art Sale, adding: 'Despite the low valuation, we expected it to fetch in excess of half a million but we were very pleased with the result. I haven’t spoken to the vendor but I expect he’s rather happy too.'

The seller’s grandmother, Lady Ethel Margaret Stronge, left the vase to his mother Mrs Rose Ethel Richardson of Tynan Abbey, County Armagh, Northern Ireland, who gave it to her son.

Tennants were inundated with requests from people with Chinese vases after they sold one for £3million in November last year

Lady Ethel Margaret married Sir James Henry Stronge who joined the diplomatic service in London in 1879 and served in Peking in the same year.

He went on to serve in the Supreme Court in Shanghai in 1885 before working in Central America from 1897 to 1907.

The seller was one of many people who sent Tennants pictures of heirlooms after a slightly older Chinese vase made £2.6m in a Tennants sale in November, the auction house said.

A vase valued at just £20,000 was sold for almost £3million at the same auction house

The blue and white bottle vase had been kept in a house in North Yorkshire for 45 years and the owner had no idea it was valuable.

But the antique was discovered by Rodney Tennant, from Tennants Auctioneers, during a routine house call to value the contents and it sold to a bidder in Hong Kong.

In November a 300-year-old blue and white vase was bought by an unnamed Chinese telephone bidder based in Hong Kong from the same auction house.

The 40cm high bottle-shaped vase, bearing the mark of 18th century Emperor Yongzheng, was conservatively estimated at £20,000-£30,000.But word quickly spread around the antiques world and collectors and dealers from China were prominent in the crowded saleroom as the bidding quickly soared.

It was knocked down for £2.6 million, which with buyer’s premium pushed the final price to just over £3 million.

In 2010 a Chinese vase found in the UK was sold for £53 million.

Tony Johnson, 54, from the Isle of Wight, sold the artifact from the 1740 Qing dynasty to billionaire Chinese property developer Wang Jianlin.

It was said to have been brought back from China by an ‘adventurous uncle’ after being stolen from an imperial palace by British troops during the 19th Century Opium Wars.

The vase was then at the centre of a legal row between the auction house and Wang Jianlin, and 18 months after the sale Johnson has still not received a penny from the sale.
