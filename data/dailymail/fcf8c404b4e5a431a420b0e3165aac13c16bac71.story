The man who helped researchers gain access to the highest canopy of the Amazon rainforest has now created the UK's first treetop trampoline adventure park.

With bridges, slides, giant trampolines, walkways and tunnels, Treetop Nets allows daredevils to explore the trees while up to 30 feet off the ground.

The aerial attraction, set in the beautiful oak woodland of Brockhole near Windermere in Cumbria, is the 16th net adventure park to open in the world.

The course, which spans over 1,200 square metres, is made of ropes and nets traditionally used in sailing. Participants are surrounded by three-metre-high walls of netting and do not require a harness.

Treetop Net was constructed by Cedric Chauvaud, one of the world's best sailor and rope experts, and his team of seven ex fishermen and sailors.

He said: 'I went to help researchers in the Amazon rainforest to gain access to the high canopy, so I designed a series of rope bridges and nets which allowed them to study the forest without causing damage.

'Once I saw it put together I thought what a great idea it would be replicate as a children's playground.'

Cedric and his team spent six weeks at the Windermere site construction the exciting new park.

Mike Turner, who owns both the treetop nets and its neighbouring high ropes attraction tree top trek, said: 'They used fishing needles to sew (or lash) the nets together to create the 3D shapes and elements, like the slides and bridges, before lifting them into the trees with ladders to attach them to cables. There was an amazing art to how it was all done.' 

All participants at Treetop Net are completely surrounded by 3m high walls of netting for safety reasons
