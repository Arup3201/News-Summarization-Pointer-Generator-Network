Former Formula One boss Max Mosley, pictured outside court yesterday, has won his latest round of his ongoing legal battle against Google

Former Formula One boss Max Mosley has won his latest round of his ongoing legal battle against Google after the High Court refused to block his claim for damages over 'sex orgy' pictures.

Mosley, 74, is seeking damages from Google UK and parent company Google Inc, and an injunction banning the publication of the photographs on the search engine.

He has brought a claim against US-based Google Inc and Google UK under the Data Protection Act and against Google Inc for misuse of private information.

Google's lawyers said that his case is unsustainable in fact and law and should be struck out.

They also argued that permission to serve the claim on Google Inc outside the jurisdiction of the court should be set aside. 

But Mr Justice Mitting said today that the claim brought against US-based Google Inc under the Data Protection Act should continue.

He said: 'On the contrary, it seems to me to be a viable claim which raises questions of general public interest which ought to proceed to trial.' 

The litigation follows Mosley's 2008 privacy victory against the now-defunct News Of The World newspaper when he won £60,000 compensation after it accused him of taking part in a 'sick Nazi orgy' with five prostitutes.

Mosley, the son of the 1930s Fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley, did not dispute taking part in the sadomasochistic roleplay at a rented Chelsea basement flat, but said it was consensual and private, with no Nazi overtones.

He said that his life had been devastated by the March 2008 expose and by the newspaper putting secretly-filmed footage on its website, which attracted at least 3.5 million hits.

Mosley has campaigned for privacy ever since his unusual sexual tastes were exposed, backing pressure group Hacked Off and giving evidence in the Leveson Enquiry.

He has also been successful in legal bids to stop Google from directing users to images of the orgy via the French and German courts.

Mr Justice Mitting yesterday said damages ‘may simply not be available’ to Mosley but said some form of injunction banning the images could be ‘much less problematic’.

Today he ruled there is jurisdiction for Mosley’s claim and ordered the case to go to trial at London’s High Court.

After the hearing, Mr Mosley said: 'I am very pleased with the result.

'What is important is that they are now going to have to come in front of the courts in the UK, where they do an enormous amount of business, to seek to justify their conduct.

'The only thing I regret is that it was necessary to have a hearing in the High Court in order to get them to do this.'

Speaking today, the judge said: ‘A judicial remedy is available. The claimant clearly has a legal benefit which the court may grant and what the claimant requires amounts to general monitoring.

‘Existing technology permits Google to block images as it does with views of child pornography.

‘The claimant has a viable case and it seems to me to be a claim of viable public interest which ought to proceed to trial.’ 

Google fiercely contest Mosley’s claims, believing any form of filter on searches could amount to censorship of the web.

Analysing the role of internet search engines, Mr Justice Mitting said ‘about 60 trillion’ web pages are posted onto the internet each year.

The judge, sitting at the High Court in London (pictured), said that Mosley 'plainly has a legal remedy, which the court may grant'.

He added: ‘A person searching for an image will click on a thumbnail of the image. A smaller version of the image on the website will be seen and stored inside a cache.

‘All this is done automatically. Google has no control over this, when a user types in searches thumbnails will be displaying they see then come into view. The order is established by an algorithm.’

Around 435,000 people viewed the photos and around 1.5 million had seen the video footage immediately after publication, the court heard earlier.

The judge, who was told that Mosley’s action against Google UK under the Data Protection Act had been discontinued, went on to stay Mosley's damages claim against Google Inc for misuse of private information, which he had described as 'deeply problematic'. 

The remaining action concerns Mosley's bid to obtain an order requiring the search engine to cease processing the images. 

Google's counsel, Antony White QC, said that it had used its notice and takedown procedures to block images when specific URLs had been provided because, whatever the strict legal position, it had some sympathy for Mosley and wished to avoid a dispute.

But, Mosley's counsel, Hugh Tomlinson QC, said he had been forced to engage in what a Canadian court had described as an 'endless game of 'whack-a-mole''.

This was despite the fact that it was possible - as Google now accepted - for the search engine to take technical steps to prevent the images being indexed by Google Search in the first place.

The judge said that Mosley 'plainly has a legal remedy, which the court may grant'.
