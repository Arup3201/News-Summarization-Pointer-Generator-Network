Fresh off a legal setback that again finds her responsible for the 2007 murder of British student Meredith Kercher, Amanda Knox has been offered a new job - as a porn actress.

An adult entertainment company - with a knack for gimmicky publicity stunts - has offered 'Foxy Knoxy' $20,000 to star in a porn film.

Adult film distributor Monarchy Distribution says it's offering Knox the 'unique opportunity' to pay her mounting legal bills and fund her education by getting naked on film.

'As you may have read, and were most likely well aware of, the general consensus is you are absolutely smoking hot,' company founder Michael Kulich writes in an e-mail to Knox forwarded to the Daily Dot. 'Since you came back into the headlines, our loyal fan base has been e-mailing us non-stop asking about you.'

Kulich's email gives Knox the assurance that she would have final say 'over all terms of production' - Kulich says Knox will get to choose which sex acts she performs on film, and which 'talent' she wants to work with.

'This is a great opportunity for you to make some money to put towards 
finishing your education and also future legal costs to help with this 
unfortunate retrial,' Kulich continues.

This is far from the first time Kulich's company has tried to cash in on attractive women who make headlines.

In December of 2013, Kulich made a similar offer to shamed former PR executive Justine Sacco.

PR Stunt: Monarchy Distribution offered shamed former PR executive Justine Sacco $10,000 to appear in a porn film

Sacco - a former public relations executive with IAC, an Internet company with brands like Ask.com and The Daily Beast - made headlines last year when she posted derogatory, racial remarks on Twitter before boarding a flight to Africa.

'Going to Africa. Hope I don’t get AIDS. Just kidding. I’m white!' Sacco tweeted on December 22.

Before Sacco's flight touched down in South Africa, news of her offensive tweet had already made headlines across the globe - there were journalists and photographers waiting at the airport for her flight to land. She was promptly fired by IAC CEO Barry Diller.

After the incident, Kulich offered Sacco $10,000 to appear in an adult film with the title 'Justine's African Vacation.'

For another PR stunt, Kulich used political laughing stock Anthony Weiner's notoriety to push his brand.

In July of 2013, after it was revealed that Weiner's X-rated social media habits continued well after he was forced to resign from Congress for a series of sexually charged conversations he had with women over social networking sites, Weiner was pressured by many to end his bid to become the Democratic nominee for New York City's mayor.

After the scandal broke, Kulich announced that he was producing a movie titled 'Don't Pull Out,' and donating 15 percent of the profits to Weiner's failed mayoral campaign.

After news of Weiner's texting made headlines, the woman at the center of the scandal - Sydney Leathers - appeared in a porn film spoofing the Weiner scandal. Leathers' film is titled 'Weiner and Me.'

This isn't the first time Knox has been offered a job in the porn industry; in 2011, after winning the appeal of her initial guilty verdict in the Kercher murder case, Vivid Entertainment - which, like Monarch Distribution - has a long history of headline-inspired publicity stunts - offered Knox a job.

'We would like to offer her the opportunity to be our vivid.com spokesperson and represent the studio at trade and retail events.This would involve no nudity or sex. Of course we would welcome talking to her if she wants to pursue this direction, but the decision is totally hers to express," the company said in its publicized offer to Knox.

Knox, however, did not respond to the gimmick.
