Vice President Joe Biden has become well known for his love of close talking, and he was at it again on Tuesday.

Biden was at the swearing in ceremony of new Defense Secretary Ash Carter, and as Carter delivered his speech, Biden could be seen in the background with his arms on the shoulders of the man's wife, Stephanie, and whispering into her ear.

Now, many conservative commentators are criticizing Biden for his frequent nuzzling of women right in front of the cameras.

'Just once, I'd like to see a husband in this situation knock Joe Biden out,' wrote Brad Thor, an author who makes frequent appearances on Fox News.

He then added; 'If Joe Biden did this to my wife, SHE'D knock him out. I'd have to take a number and wait my turn...'

Finally, he said; 'ISIS? Ashton Carter can't even fight off Joe Biden...'

Radio personality Mark Simone said; 'Creepy Joe Biden strikes again, hanging onto Ashton Carter's wife (and whispering things) at Carter's swearing-in.'

'Not sure why a creep like @VP is not shunned by civil society,' said Daily beast columnist Stuart Stevens.

Conservative blogger Michelle Malkin was far more brief, labeling him an 'a**clown.'

Biden found himself in the same situation back in January, when many felt he got to close to 12-year-old Maggie Coons during her father's swearing in ceremony.

Delaware Senator Chris Coons then had to explain that his daughter did not find the Vice President 'creepy,' and that he had known her for years. 

There was also the time Biden got close to a lady while hanging with a group of bikers in Ohio in September 2012, with the men in the group exchanging glances as Biden gave the woman what appeared to be a shoulder massage. 

Biden is also not afraid to get close to political leaders either, having been seen whispering into nthe ears of women like Hillary Clinton, President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil, and President Mary McAleese of Ireland. 

The vice president’s office declined to comment about Tuesday's whisper.
