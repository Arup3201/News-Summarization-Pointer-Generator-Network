A new winter misery index confirms what many Americans in the Midwest and East know in their all-too-chilled bones: This has been one of the harshest winters of our lifetimes.

And nowhere has been hit harder, relatively, than Detroit.

Sure Chicago, Indianapolis and Philadelphia and Moline, Ill., are in the midst of their third most extreme winters in more than 60 years.

But Detroit, a city that is trying to crawl out of bankruptcy, is also slogging through what so far is the most extreme winter it has had since Harry Truman was president, at least, according to a winter extremity index created by a National Weather Service meteorologist Barbara Mayes Boustead.

Freezing: Temperatures are set to drop up to 30 degrees below normal mid-week across the Midwest as the Polar Vortex returns for a third round of severe arctic weather.

Wednesday forecast: The eastern two-thirds of the U.S is expected to see below-average temperatures this week after January averages were found to have been well below normal

The index is based on cold temperatures and snowfall. And so far Detroit has had more than 6 1/2 feet of snow and 100 days when the thermometer plunged below the freezing mark. Of two dozen cities studied, Detroit alone is in the middle of its harshest winter since 1950.

Boustead, a former Detroit-area 
resident who now works in Omaha, Neb., created the index a couple years 
ago to judge the severity of winters.

Omaha,
 by the way, is the only city in two dozen metro areas that Boustead 
examined that is not having an 'extreme' or 'severe' winter. It's merely
 average.

Boustead
 uses daily high and low temperatures and daily and accumulated snowfall
 to come up with a winter index that's equivalent to the way 
meteorologists categorize hurricanes and tornadoes. Officially, it is 
called the Accumulated Winter Season Severity Index.

'I personally would call this a misery index,' said Boustead.

New York, Milwaukee and Duluth are in the midst of their fourth harshest winters. Also having top-10 harshest winters are Minneapolis-St. Paul in Minnesota; Louisville, Ky.; Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., and Cheyenne, Wyo.

The idea is to put winter in context.
 This winter seems unusually harsh because it has been a while since the
 late 1970s and early 1980s when severe winters were far more frequent. 
People have short memories.

Plus, for almost three-quarters of the places studied the winter of 2011-2012 was the mildest on record, Boustead said.

But why Detroit? Just
 bad geography and luck. Much of the cold and snow this winter is 
because of a change in the jet stream that has funneled frigid air south
 from the Arctic 'right down the alley' through Detroit, Hilberg said.

The
 winter index keeps going, until the cold, snowy weather stops. And 
that's at least a couple weeks away, according to forecasts.

'We're going to push that index a little bit higher,' Boustead said. 'Let's see how much higher we can go.'

The relentless snow and ice storms this season have been connected to scores of traffic-related deaths and have led to the highest number of flight cancellations in more than 25 years.

U.S. airlines have canceled more than 75,000 domestic flights since December 1, including roughly 14,000 last week - the highest total number and highest percent of cancellations since at least the winter of 1987-1988, when records began.

Meanwhile, temperatures are set to drop up to 30 degrees below normal mid-week across the Midwest as the Polar Vortex returns for a third round of severe arctic weather.

The arctic blast will head east plunging temperatures in Indiana and Massachusetts into single digits. Even the Deep South will experience temperatures below freezing, according to the National Weather Service (NWS).

The NWS said it will not be as severe as the first Polar Vortex to hit the U.S. in January but described it as 'a cold mass of arctic air.'

Cities including New York to Chicago, Minneapolis, Detroit and Washington, D.C. had all been enjoying temperatures in the 50s last weekend.

The Midwest and North East were thawing out after being covered with more than a foot of snow over the past week, but forecasters have warned it won't be for long as another cold front is on its way.

The eastern two-thirds of the U.S is expected to see below-average temperatures this week after January averages were found to have been well below normal according to a to a monthly climate report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

The cold spell comes from the northern polar vortex, a high-altitude flow of air that circles west to east above the North Pole.
