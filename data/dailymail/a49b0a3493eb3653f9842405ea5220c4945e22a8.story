Three top Khmer Rouge leaders accused of orchestrating Cambodia's ‘killing fields’ went on trial today before a U.N. backed tribunal more than three decades after some of the 20th century's worst atrocities.

Judge Nil Nonn declared the trial open and read the names of the three senior Khmer Rouge leaders who are defendants in the tribunal in the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh.

The defendants, who sat side by side with their lawyers, are 85-year-old Nuon Chea, the Khmer Rouge's chief ideologist and the No. 2 leader behind the late Pol Pot; 80-year-old Khieu Samphan, an ex-head of state; and 86-year-old Ieng Sary, the former foreign minister.

A fourth defendant, 79-year-old Ieng Thirith, was ruled unfit to stand trial last week because she has Alzheimer's disease. She is Ieng Sary's wife and served as the regime's minister for social affairs.

The charges against the surviving inner circle of the communist movement include crimes against humanity, genocide, religious persecution, homicide and torture stemming from their 1975-79 reign of terror.

An estimated 1.7 million people died of execution, starvation, exhaustion or lack of medical care as a result of the Khmer Rouge's radical policies, which essentially turned all of Cambodia into a forced labour camp as the movement attempted to create a pure agrarian socialist society.

Intellectuals, entrepreneurs and anyone considered a threat were imprisoned, tortured and often executed.

Tribunal spokesman Huy Vannak called the proceedings ‘the most important trial in the world’ because of the seniority of those involved.

‘It sends a message that the trial, which survivors have been waiting more than three decades for, finally begins,’ he said.

The Khmer Rouge's supreme leader, Pol Pot, died in 1998 in Cambodia's jungles while a prisoner of his own comrades, who after being toppled from power fought a guerrilla war that did not fully end until the late 1990s.

There is serious concern that justice may not be done if any of the ageing and infirm defendants dies before a trial is finished.

In September, the tribunal announced it would split up the indictments according to charge into separate trials in order to expedite the proceedings.

The current trial is considering charges involving the forced movement of people and crimes against humanity.

‘It's the first time the senior leadership of the Khmer Rouge is being tried by a court with international backing.

‘It's the first time thousands of victims have had a forum to tell their stories, and demand reparations for their suffering,’ said Clair Duffy of the Open Society Justice Initiative, which has been monitoring the tribunal's work.

Battle-hardened former Khmer Rouge guerrilla Lim Sambath echoes the words that have become a mantra for the servants of the ultra-Maoist regime that tore Cambodia apart three decades ago.         

‘We had to follow orders,’ he said of his role in the bloody ‘year zero’ revolution that wiped out 1.7 million Cambodians - a quarter of the population - from 1975-1979.

‘Almost all Cambodians are victims. Everybody had to follow the regime's policy,’ he said. ‘Those who defied the rules, their fate was death.’               

Like Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan and Ieng Sary, Lim Sambath, 58, distances himself from the killings and says his recollection of the harrowing era is vague.    

He tells stories of his battlefield heroics to repel Vietnamese invaders but denies responsibility for any of the hundreds of thousands of men, women and children who died of torture, starvation, disease and execution in the rice fields and makeshift jails run by Pol Pot's black-clad disciples.               

‘I don't know how many people were killed,’ Lim Sambath, a former guerrilla commander, now a community leader, told reporters at his home in Boyakha village on the western border with Thailand.              

‘We had to follow orders. We had little knowledge. We saw no light. It was like living on another planet. But that was the only planet we knew.’

The closest any of the former cadres have come to disclosure is seen in the documentary film ‘Enemies of the People’, in which Nuon Chea, during six years of interviews with journalist Thet Sambath, admitted threats to the party line were ‘destroyed’ if they could not be ‘corrected or re-educated’.  

The film is expected to be used as evidence against Nuon Chea, who denies the charges.     

Chhang Youk, director of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, which has compiled evidence to use during the trial, said it was unlikely defendants would confess but he was confident justice would eventually prevail.   ‘Everyone wants a final judgement of what happened,’ he said.

‘We've seen the Khmer Rouge hasn't changed its attitude. They won't admit anything, so the tribunal is really important.’ 

‘It therefore has a huge potential not 
only to contribute to justice in Cambodia, but also to contribute 
dialogue to on-going efforts to bring perpetrators of these kinds of 
atrocities to justice around the world.’

Chea Leang, Cambodian co-prosecutor, recalled for the court the brutalities of Khmer Rouge rule, beginning on April 17, 1975, when they captured Phnom Penh to end a bitter five-year civil war, and immediately began the forced evacuation to the countryside of the estimated one million people who had been sheltering in the capital.

She also recounted the new social order established by the group: Personal property was banned, religion, press and all personal freedoms abolished.

Pol Pot had led the Khmer Rouge from its clandestine revolutionary origins to open resistance after a 1970 coup installed a pro-American government and dragged Cambodia directly into the maelstrom of the Vietnam War.

When the Khmer Rouge took power in 1975, they all but sealed off the country to the outside world. Sending the inhabitants of the cities off to vast rural communes was part of an effort to turn the country into a socialist utopia.

Economic and social disaster ensued, but the failures only fed the group's paranoia, and suspected traitors said to be working with the U.S., or Vietnam, the country's traditional enemy, were hunted down, only plunging the country further into chaos.

Vietnam, whose border provinces had suffered bloody attacks, sponsored a resistance movement and invaded, ousting the Khmer Rouge from power in 1979 and installing a client regime.

The U.N.-backed tribunal, which was established in 2006, has tried just one case, convicting Kaing Guek Eav, the former head of the regime's notorious S-21 prison, last July and sentencing him to 35 years in prison for war crimes, crimes against humanity and other offences.

That case was seen as much simpler than the current case, which covers a much broader range of activities and because Kaing Guek Eav confessed to his crimes.

Those going on trial today have steadfastly maintained their innocence. The prison chief was also far lower in the regime's leadership ranks than the current defendants.
