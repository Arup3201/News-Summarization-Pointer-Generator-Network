What do you do on long flights, watch a movie, read a book, or try to get some sleep?

Paul Williams takes jaw-dropping images of the landscape unfurling below him.

His impressive series of pictures capture a rare view of Australia only viewable from thousands of feet in the air.

Some of the sights include a 'desert footprint' in the Western Australian wheatfields, a fried-egg shape between Broome and Perth and what looks like a human sperm - which Paul has entitled 'desert seed'.

Red planet: Mr Williams captured this stunning image somewhere between Alice Springs and Perth

The Rotherham-born 34-year-old is a producer and director at the BBC Natural History Unit so is used to traversing the globe in search of impressive natural wonders.

But his in-transit images, shot with a Canon EOS 7D, make for a remarkable gallery of an untamed continent.

He explains: 'As a director for the BBC Natural History Unit, I spend a lot of time flying around the world, and it isn't long before I've exhausted all of the onboard movies.

Paul Williams took the images to kill time while flying around the world for his BBC natural history job

'To keep myself occupied I make sure that I always have my camera with me, and I think carefully before choosing my seat.

'I check out the path that the flight might take, consider which side will give me the best view, what time of day and where the sun will be, and most importantly make sure that I am as far away from the wing as possible - my favourite seat is a couple of rows from the back.

'My favourite continent to fly over is Australia. 'The sky is usually cloudless offering a clear view, it's often sunny and it's always spectacular.

'It's like flying over the surface of Mars and I find myself captivated by the vivid expressions of the underlying geology,

I find myself captivated by the vivid expressions of the underlying geology. The patterns of red and orange, dry lake beds and giant sand dunes.'

He added: 'Australia is one of the oldest and most stable continental landmasses, the mountains have been worn down, much of the soil has been blow away, and with little vegetation able to survive in the arid red centre it reads like a living geological map.

'The folds and layers of the ancient sediments stretch out on one enormous flat canvas, dissected by ribbon-like rivers such as the Murchison, the countries second longest. You can fly for hours without seeing any sign of human life, but then slowly the landscape evolves.

Fields and farms captured from the air, somewhere between Broome and Perth

This image could be molten lava, or it could be the surface of a leaf. But it is actually the Australian landscape captured from the skies by photographer Paul Williams

Mr Williams has called this image Desert Paintpot. It shows quarries in western Australia's wheatbelt and was taken while the photographer was flying for his job with the BBC

'I recently flew from Alice Springs to Perth and as the red desert waned, the vast angular blocks of the wheat belt came into view, like a yellow chequer board stretching to the horizon.

'It covers 155,000 square kilometres, larger than the whole of England and only where ancient lakes are found does the land remain untamed. Scattered across this patchwork of monoculture are thousands of abandoned old quarries, like paint pots, some blood red, others yolk yellow.

'As Perth drew closer the fields became smaller and houses started to appear, clustering closer and closer until I reached the modern world, the towering metropolis of downtown Perth on the banks of the Swan River."

This could be a golden sculpture or parchment. But it is actually a farm near Perth photographed from the air
