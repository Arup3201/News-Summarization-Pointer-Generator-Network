A rocket scientist has urged Virgin Galactic to 'stay out of the space business' and 'go sell mobile phones'  in the wake of a fatal explosion aboard one of its spacecraft.

Carolynne Campbell-Knight, a rocket propulsion scientist at the International Association for the Advancement of Space Safety (IAASS), said Richard Branson's private space line should 'give up' following the test flight crash in which a pilot was killed. 

Michael Alsbury, 39, died at the controls of Virgin's experimental SpaceShipTwo vessel on Friday after the sub-orbital plane exploded at 45,000ft shortly after engaging its engines. His co-pilot, Peter Siebold, who was seriously injured, is now 'alert and talking', according to the company.

Co-operation: Richard Branson said Virgin Galactic were complying with an independent investigation into the crash

Mrs Campbell-Knight said: 'They should stop, give up. Go away and do something they might be good at like selling mobile phones - they should stay out of the space business.' 

She claimed she had contacted those involved in the project in around 2009 or 2010 to raise her concerns about the use of nitrous oxide, which she said can 'go bang in a very unpredictable way'. 

But she stressed it was not yet clear what caused the latest incident, adding: 'There’s any number of things that could have brought it down.'

Mrs Campbell-Knight, co-partner of Knights Arrow, an engineering project, is one of a number of space flight experts who have accused Virgin Galactic of ignoring warnings over its safety procedures in the wake of a fatal explosion aboard one of its spacecraft.

Senior engineers and propulsion scientists say they spent years telling Richard Branson's private space line its procedures are 'outdated', needlessly secretive, and could lead to people getting killed.  

And, in a further sign of upheaval at Virgin Galactic, it was also revealed yesterday that top engineers in charge of safety, aerodynamics and the propulsion system have all recently quit the company.

Many of the warnings stem from a 2007 disaster where an engine part exploded at a test facility in the Mojave Desert, killing three employees of Virgin Galactic's partner company, Scaled Composites.

Some have accused Richard Branson's project of ignoring industry standards and refusing to share its procedures in its eagerness to perfect commercial space flight, which it has regularly estimated is just months from completion.

One expert called the design and testing process a 'Russian roulette' which was bound to kill someone.

Carolynne Campbell, a rocket propulsion scientist at the International Association for the Advancement of Space Safety (IAASS), told the Sunday Telegraph she had been warning Virgin Galactic for seven years about its safety record.

She said: 'This explosion is not a surprise. None whatsoever, I am sorry to say. It is exactly what I was expecting. It was Russian roulette which test flight blew up.'

The executive director of the IAASS also said that Virgin Galactic refused to let scientists from outside the company review its procedures, and snubbed industry gatherings.

Tomasso Sgobba, a former head of safety for the European Space Agency, said: 'They operated in secrecy, which is difficult to understand.

'They don’t use modern techniques in putting safety into the design... I have been saying for some years now this was an accident waiting to happen.'

Geoff Daly, a concerned rocket scientist, also revealed that he wrote to the U.S. Chemical Safety Board urging them to do something about his safety concerns over SpaceShipTwo.

Writing in July 2013, he said even the company's own engineers privately doubted that their venture was safe.

At the time Virgin Galactic had said they were just five months away from taking their first passengers, including children, into space.

He said: 'Sir Richard Branson, his two children, Justin Bieber and one other will be the first passengers to fly into space during this coming December 2013, and everyone realises there is a problem, even the engineers... have said so off the record.'

The disaster came in the wake of three top engineers at Virgin Galactic quitting since late 2013.

Jon Turnipseed, formerly the vice-president of safety, reportedly left just before Christmas.

The Parabolic Arc blog reported that Virgin Galactic spent months unsuccessfully advertising for a successor to the job.

The outlet also reported that Thomas Markusic, the vice-president of propulsion, left Virgin Galactic in January 2014 to work on a company sending unmanned satellites into space instead.

Senior figures were walking out of the development facility as recently as last month, according to a biographer of Branson who said the 'crude' SpaceShipTwo's destruction was 'inevitable'.

Speaking to the BBC's Today show yesterday, Tom Bower said: 'All the engineers in California working on the project I've spoken to said it was very dangerous, just a few weeks ago the last of many of the Virgin Galactic engineers walked out of the factory and said he'd never work there again.'

He added: 'The most important issue was in 2007 - three engineers were killed in an explosion when a rocket exploded on the ground rocket explosion on the ground.

'Ever since then it has become apparent that the science used to create this rocket is completely unreliable.'

The explosion seven years ago, which killed Scaled Composites employees Todd Ivens, Eric Blackwell and Charles May, has been the focus of many criticisms. Some say it ought to have been a wake-up call for the company.

The fatal accident took place at a ground facility while testing an engine filled with nitrous oxide, a liquid fuel which is part of SpaceShipTwo's hybrid rocket engine.

'Dangerous': Flight safety experts claim they repeatedly voiced their concerns over the private space line

Debris: A small part of the doomed spacecraft lies in the Californian desert. Experts have said they were not surprised by the crash

Wreckage: Officers keep watch over what remains of SpaceShipTwo, which crashed into the California desert on Friday

Findings: Investigators take photographs of the wreckage of SpaceShipTwo, which crashed into the Californian desert

Investigations failed to discover why the tank blew up - especially as the test was not meant to ignite the fuel.

A study published by the IAASS said: 'We are not confident that … we yet know enough about N2O [nitrous oxide] to consider it a safe oxidiser for use in passenger flight. In the light of what we do know, safety must remain a major concern.'

Daly, the rocket scientists, also referenced the fatal event, and wrote to the Federal Aviation Administration urging them to review Virgin Galactic's premit to operate space flights.

He said: 'We respectfully request a response from you on what actions the FAA will be taking with respect to the permit issued and the operations as planned in the Mojave and New Mexico facilities.

'Remember three people have been killed and numerous persons injured by a prior explosion involving N2O in this motor design. We do not need another incident on the ground/flight line or in the air.' 

Fatal: Test pilot Michael Alsbury died on Friday morning after the spacecraft exploded at 45,000ft

Standing firm: Virgin Founder Richard Branson denied his company had ignored any warnings, and insisted that nothing can be known until the official investigation is finished

Speaking today at his Mojave Spaceport, Virgin founder Richard Branson denied that the company had ignored warnings.

He said: 'To be honest I find it slightly irresponsible that people who know nothing about what they are saying can be saying things before the NTSB [one body investigating the crash] makes their comments.

'We aren’t going to push on blindly. To do so would be an insult to all those affected by this tragedy. We are going to learn from what went wrong, discover how we can improve safety and performance and then move forwards together.

'We owe it to our test pilots to find out exactly what went wrong and once we find out what went wrong, if we can overcome it, we’ll make absolutely certain that the dream lives on.'
