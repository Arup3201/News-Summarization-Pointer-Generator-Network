Brazil manager Dunga thinks Hoffenheim midfielder Roberto Firmino could play for any team in the world as speculation increases that Arsenal are preparing an offer.

Firmino netted the decisive goal as Brazil beat South American rivals Chile at The Emirates stadium on Sunday with a clinical one-on-one finish that gave Dunga's side their eighth straight win since the World Cup.

'He can play for any club and being on the Brazilian national team that comes a lot easier,' Dunga said.

Firmino has been one of a number of Brazil players to come into the international fold after Brazil reached the semi-final of the 2104 World Cup as hosts. 

Arsene Wenger is reportedly keen to make Firmino a regular at The Emirates but faces competition from Pep Guardiola and Bayern Munich.

Hoffenheim are seventh in the German Bundesliga at the moment, eight points away from a Champions League place.
