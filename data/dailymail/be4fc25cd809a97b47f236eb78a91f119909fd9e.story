A packed passenger jet slid off an icy Maine runway during a treacherous Sunday storm.

A flight from New York City to Bangor International Airport slid off an icy taxiway in as it made its way to the terminal, but no passengers were injured.

Officials said the Delta flight from LaGuardia Airport went into the grass off the taxiway shortly before 1 p.m.

Treacherous: The loaded jet slid into the grass while trying to turn onto a taxiway towards the terminal

The 50-passenger jet had the brief scare while taxiing towards the gate after landing when it’s front wheel lost control while trying to make a turn, the relative of a passenger told the Bangor Daily News.

The entire aircraft slid into the grass, the relative noted, adding that rescue vehicles also had a hard time reaching the marooned plane.

‘Even the trucks coming out to try to get the plane had their wheels spinning on the asphalt,’ said Mike O’Neill. ‘They didn’t notice anything that was wrong but that someone else on the flight said ‘Oh, we’re going off.’ And then that was when they went off the asphalt.’

The airport says the aircraft was returned to the taxiway and towed to the gate where passengers deplaned starting just before 2 p.m.

Airport Director Anthony Caruso says the plane skidded in the icy conditions experienced by much of the state through the day.

Among the many motorist mishaps reported by the Daily News was a bus carrying junior and varsity high school athletes that slid into a ditch during the ice storm paralyzing much of the state this weekend.
