The long-awaited dredging of rivers on the Somerset Levels finally began today - three months after the area was hit by the worst floods in 250 years.

Diggers began scooping silt from a 200-metre stretch of the River Parrett, near Burrowbridge, as the multi-million scheme got underway.

Environment Agency (EA) engineers will clear around five miles of the river and the neighbouring River Tone in the programme - which is expected to take several months.

Dredging began on the River Parrot, between Burrowbridge and Moorland today, three months after the area was hit by the worst flooding in 250 years

Furious locals blame a lack of dredging by the EA for the floods which destroyed their homes after the heaviest January rainfall on record.

It is hoped the £5.8million dredging will improve the capacity of the rivers, which are currently operating at just 60 per cent, and reduce flooding in the future.

Today's work is on a key part of the river which has been specially chosen because 'significant amounts' of silt have built up.

Engineers used 22-tonne long reach excavators fitted with high-tech computers to help dredge the river to pre-determined profiles.

More silt is removed for the bed of the River Parrett. The neighbouring River Tone will also be dredged

Smaller seven-tonne tracked dumpers removed the dredged material from the banks to disposal points.

An amphibious excavator - one of just two in the UK - will work to remove silt from the more 'awkward' sections of the river in the coming days.

The specialist equipment has been hired from private company Land and Water Plant.

Director Richard Maclean said: 'Dredging the Parrett is no simple task and as such, it calls for some extremely specialist equipment.

'The amphibious excavator is truly amphibious. It is as happy working in a river as it is working on a marsh or next to watercourses.

Those hit by the wet January weather blame the previous lack of dredging by the EA for the flooding. Today, one resident said the presence of diggers was a 'very welcome sight'

'This machine is extremely rare and is able to work with ease in areas where conventional plant would either risk getting stuck or where it would be expensive and damaging to the local ecology to put in temporary roadways.

'It is anticipated it will be used for the more awkward sections of the River Parrett where more conventional plant cannot work.'

Paul Leinster, chief executive of the Environment Agency, said yesterday marked an 'important milestone' in work to reduce the risk of flooding in the future.

He added: 'We welcome the additional money from Government that has allowed us to undertake this further dredging.

'We are committed to dredging as part of the joint action plan, which includes other measures such as supporting farmers and making some temporary flood risk management measures permanent.'

The start of the project was keenly watched by residents - many who are still unable to return to their wrecked homes.

Gav Sadler, founding member of Flooding on the Levels Action Group (FLAG), welcomed the action but called for more 'transparency'.

The equipment has been hired from private company Land and Water Plant. Its director said today the process of dredging would be 'no simple task'

Mr Sadler, from nearby Moorland, said: 'It is a very encouraging sight, seeing the dredging on the river.

'It has been a long time coming. Hopefully some of our campaigning has led to that. We have got to remember that the 8km stretch they are working on is just the beginning.

'We would like to see all the rivers dredged. Another issue is we don't know the quality of the dredging they are going to do.

'They keep saying they are going to do a "proper job" and restore the rivers to the 1960s profile. We would like to see what they are reprofiling it to.

'We would like to see a little bit of transparency from the Environment Agency. This affects our lives, we want to make sure they do a proper job.'

More silt is removed. The action today is part of a 20-year £100million plan - commissioned by Environment Secretary Owen Paterson - to ensure homes in the area are never flooded again

The dredging follows months of extreme weather. Earlier in the year, millions of tonnes of water were pumped off the Levels every day by 40 permanent and 25 temporary pumps.

The Environment Agency has insisted that dredging would not have prevented the flood crisis.

The action is just the start of a 20-year £100million plan - the Somerset Levels and Moors Flood Action Plan- to ensure their homes are never engulfed by murky flood waters ever again.

It was commissioned by Environment Secretary Owen Paterson and includes a new tidal barrier and the raising key roads.
