A university cheerleader fell to her death from a warehouse roof after scaling the building with a friend to get a better look at a nearby river, an inquest heard today.

Outgoing student Vanessa Clarke, 23, had decided to 
climb up the building in order to get a better view of the River Avon, 
next to the building in Bath, Somerset.

But in a tragic turn of events Miss Clarke plummeted 20ft onto the concrete floor of a builders’ merchant warehouse after enjoying a night out in May this year.

An inquest into her death heard she died almost instantly from head injuries after toppling six metres through the roof.

Flax Bourton Coroner’s Court heard Miss Clarke, a third-year computer science student at the University of Bath, was walking home from the city centre with a friend at 4am on May 5.

They decided to climb onto the roof of the Travis Perkins building, in Lower Bristol Road, to look at the River Avon.

But the roof gave way under the Bath Jets cheerleader and she fell 20ft onto a concrete floor below. She died almost instantly from head injuries.

Tributes, including flowers and cheerleading vests, were left on railings close to the site after her death.

One message on a bunch of flowers read: 'Colourful ones for a colourful princess.'

A verdict of death by misadventure was given into her death at Flax Bourton Coroner’s Court today.

After her death, Bath University said in a statement: 'The University is saddened to announce the death of Vanessa Clarke, a third year Computer Science with Business undergraduate student.
