When Gerard and Christina White moved into their home 37 years ago, they felt the leafy street of detached properties was among the finest in the suburb.

But the couple fear their £275,000 home is now unsellable – after an extension on the house next door effectively turned the Whites’ three-bedroom detached property into a semi.

The two 1930s houses originally stood 4ft apart but are now separated by only inches. They stand so close together that their roofs and gutters overlap.

Too close for comfort: Since the extension has been built, there is only a gap of a few inches

How it was: The gap between the Birmingham homes used to be around four foot

Gerard and Christina White say the huge extension will knock thousands off the value of their home

Mrs White, 65, a retired deputy headmistress, said: ‘All professionals involved agree the build is not according to plan but, as far as we know, the planning department intends no further action.

‘This will knock thousands off the value of our home. In fact, it probably makes it unsellable.’

Mr White, 70, a retired motor engineer, said 345 people from their neighbourhood of Moseley, Birmingham, had signed a petition against the plans, including 125 from their own street.

Buy-to-let landlord Mohammed Nazir bought the house next door for £225,000 in December 2012 and submitted plans to extend the detached home at the front, side and rear. The plans were due to leave only a 12-inch gap between the properties. 

The Whites objected, fearing the extension would block out light to the rear of their home, and would leave them struggling to address any maintenance issues because of the two homes’ close proximity.

The plans – under which a garage and conservatory are replaced with additional living space, as well as a new rear dining room and the addition of a fourth bedroom upstairs – were approved by Birmingham City Council in June last year.

But to the Whites’ horror, the side extension went up only eight inches from their property.

They complained and the council halted the building work while the issue was investigated. Last week the council wrote to the Whites saying that the extension would be allowed to remain.

The Whites say they are now unable to maintain their wall and guttering problems could damage their home

The couple are shocked after building work extended the house next door to within inches of their property

The letter from planning support officer Martin Mackay said: ‘While the development as built is not considered ideal by officers, it is considered not sufficiently harmful to warrant formal enforcement action.’

He added that the Whites may wish to ‘pursue the matter with your neighbour and if necessary, through a civil court’.

Mr Nazir’s application for the ‘single storey front and rear extension and two storey side extension’ was approved subject to conditions which stipulated that the build ‘must be in accordance with the plans’.

Mrs White said she was shocked that the council failed to order him to rebuild the extension to the original plan. 

Local MP Steve McCabe says planning conditions to ensure space between the homes was ignored

Birmingham council says the work is not sufficiently different from that approved to require them to take action

Local residents have signed a petition against the development, which has been branded 'a monstrosity'

She added: ‘We’ve lost a degree of the morning light because it’s blocked by the wall. Their guttering lies underneath ours which renders theirs completely useless and is bound to cause problems when we have heavy rainfall.’

Mr Nazir was not at the property yesterday and could not be contacted for comment.

Michael Healy, a surveyor who acted as his agent on the planning application, said: ‘I drew up the plans but he (Mr Nazir) didn’t stick to them.’

A council spokesman said the case has now been closed.
