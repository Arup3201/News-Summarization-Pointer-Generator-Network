Clearly not content with flashing a nipple and 'ironically' calling Barack Obama a Muslim, Madonna has decided to wade in on the shooting of a Pakistani girl after she spoke out against the Taliban.

Madonna continued to use her 'MDNA Tour' to make yet another controversial statement by strip-teasing to 'show her support' for Malala Yousafzai, who was shot on a schoolbus for writing a blog about how important education is.

On her Wednesday night performance in the Staples Centre, Los Angeles, the singer began by telling her audience that she wanted have a 'serious talk'.

In yet another 'controversial' act, the singer took her clothes off to support a cause that had touched her

According to Entertainment Today, she told fans that the news that the 14-year-old had been gunned down by the Taliban had made her 'cry'.

She said: 'The 14-year-old Pakistani girl who was shot on a schoolbus for writing a blog about how important education was to her.

'The Taliban stopped her bus and shot her. Do you understand the sickness and absurdity of this?'

She rallied the crowd by shouting at them to support education and those who help women.

But then the millionaire decided that this performance clearly was not a strong enough statement, and chose to 'dedicate' a strip tease to the girl, who is currently in a critical condition.

She turned her back to reveal 'Malala' written across it, according toÂ The Hollywood Reporter.

'This song is for Malala,' she said, before singing her 'Human Nature' song.

But her attempt to make a stand in the name of Malala backfired after furious Pakistanis discovered her act.

There was a chorus of disapproval from Twitter users, who branded her performance a shameless attempt to garner attention, Entertainment Today reported.

@OHPakistan tweetwed to NBC News' Amna Nawaz: 'Get it Right: Associating #Madonna with #Malala IS DISRESPECT TO #Malala!!! Plz. Give #Malala a rest!'

User @bijm30caahm condemned the move: 'Not the right way to pay Homage to Brave Malala. Its a way to earn cheap self popularity.'

A Taliban gunman boarded a packed school bus and shot a teenage education
activist twice at point blank range.

The brave teenager was targeted by the Taliban after speaking out against atrocities committed under the regime.

According to Malala's friend Shazia, speaking to the Christian Science 
Monitor, a group of militants riding on a bike stopped the bus carrying the schoolgirls.

Masked men then boarded the vehicle and pointed guns at the girls, 
asking for Malala.

A hooded Taliban militant shouted: 'Which one of you is Malala? Speak 
up, otherwise I will shoot you all. She is propagating against the 
soldiers of Allah, the Taliban. She must be punished.'

Almost as soon as he shouted this, the militant recognised the youngster and shot her at point blank range.

The
shooting has horrified people in Pakistan and internationally, and has 
been followed by an outpouring of respect for a girl who earned the 
enmity of the Taliban for publicising their acts and speaking about the 
importance of girls' education.

The Taliban has claimed responsibility for the shooting, saying that the girl was promoting 'Western thinking'.

Malala was shot twice at close range and is currently unconscious in hospital in a critical condition.

Madonna has also used her tour to encourage her fans to support Obama by 
demanding they vote for 'the black Muslim in the White House'.

The Queen of Pop threw her weight behind the 
president during a concert in Washington, D.C. on Monday, before stripping off 
her shirt to reveal her massive 'Obama' temporary tattoo on her 
back.

But she made a fatal error - which she later said was 'deliberately ironic' - because Obama is a Christian.
