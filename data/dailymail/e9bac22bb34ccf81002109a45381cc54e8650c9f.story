A Manhattan cocktail party to celebrate SeaWorld's 50-year anniversary was cancelled tonight after animal rights activists threatened to protest the event that promised to include two live penguins.

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) obtained an invitation to the Meatpacking District party which said 'animal ambassadors' Pete and Penny Penguin would be in attendance at eatery Bagatelle.

PETA Senior Vice President Dan Mathews contacted the restaurant on Sunday to cancel the event. On Tuesday, the restaurant took a financial hit and cancelled the event altogether.

In his email to the restaurant, Mr Mathews wrote: 'Loud DJs and flashing cameras may be alluring to your usual clientele, but they are terrifying to these arctic animals unaccustomed to being around humans, much less to being forced to attend a desperate, raucous publicity stunt.'

The restaurant's co-owner Remi Laba responded that they were 'very disturbed' to learn that SeaWorld planned to bring live animals to the event. They contacted SeaWorld's reps and informed them that the live penguins would not be allowed in the establishment and SeaWorld agreed.

However, Mr Mathews said that they would continue to protest the event, since they were against any promotion of SeaWorld following the explosive documentary Blackfish which revealed controversial treatment of orca whales.

Mr Laba went one step forward on Tuesday, cancelling the event altogether and doing 'what was right in our hearts'.

He said the event was booked by a third party organization and they didn't know who the client was, let alone their plans to bring live animals.

'PETA is hanging up our protest placards and popping the champagne corks today in recognition of Bagatelle's savvy business decision to put kindness ahead of profits,' Mr Mathews said in a press release. 'Once compassionate people and businesses learn that orcas and other animals suffer at SeaWorld, they want nothing to do with this cruel and disgusting place.'

Bagatelle is known for its wild weekend brunches, where patrons 'can be found dancing on tables, throwing back tequila shots and racking up four- and five-figure tabs well before the sky turns dark,' according to a 2009Â  New York Times article

MailOnline's calls and emails to both SeaWorld and the restaurant were not immediately returned Tuesday.

SeaWorld has been the focus of more criticism lately following the release of documentary Blackfish, which gives a damning account of the treatment of orcas at the parks.

Dark side: SeaWorld drew criticism this year after the release of documentary Blackfish which detailed their treatment of orcas. Despite the film, the company is set to have its most profitable year ever

Since the documentary's release, nine musicals acts including Trace Adkins, Willie Nelson, Trisha Yearwood, Cheap Trick and the Bearnaked Ladies have cancelled performances at the parks. Others artists like Joan Jett and Edgar Winter have asked that their music not be used in the orca performances.

But despite the documentary, SeaWorld is set to have record-setting revenue this year, the company said in an announcement yesterday.

According to preliminary estimates for the fourth quarter, the company is set to bring in $1.46 billion for the 2013 fiscal year - more than any other year in the park's history.

'We are very pleased with our fourth quarter performance, particularly for the SeaWorld-branded parks in Orlando and San Diego, which helped us to achieve record revenue for the year,' SeaWorld Entertainment Inc President and CEO Jim Atchison said in a news release.

'The success of the SeaWorld parks in 2013 suggests that the extraordinary experience offered in these parks is as meaningful today as at any point in our history. But as strong as last year was for us, we are looking forward to another great year in 2014.'
