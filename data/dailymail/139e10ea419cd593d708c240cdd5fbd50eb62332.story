Kerry Welsh of Rancho Palos Verdes, California, hopes to bring a class-action lawsuit against in-flight internet provider Gogo for allegedly misleading consumers over recurring charges

In-flight internet provider Gogo is being sued by a man who hopes to bring a class-action lawsuit against the company for allegedly misleading consumers over recurring charges.

Kerry Welsh of Rancho Palos Verdes, California, paid the company $39.95 for up to 30 days internet access on any airline on August 7, 2011.

In his lawsuit he claims that 30 days later on Sept. 7, he was charged another $39.95 and then again every 30 days after that until at least Dec. 2012 - even though he didn’t use the service.

Welsh claims he ‘received no communications from Gogo on a monthly basis notifying him of the recurring charges,’ according to the lawsuit filed last week in U.S. District Court in the Central District of California.

His attorney, Michael Reese, told ABC News that he believes the lawsuit is important ‘to vindicate consumer rights.’

Reese said his client is trying to recover on behalf of the class members the money charged to those who ‘were misled to believe they were purchasing only a one-month pass, but were in fact charged every month thereafter.’ 

The lawsuit states that ‘every other class member purchased in-flight internet serve from Gogo prior to Dec. 31, 2012, using a registration website that had representations about the monthly cost of the service but had no representations about the recurring nature of charges for the service.’

Gogo offers internet services on more than 1,900 commercial aircraft and 6,000 business aircraft

Gogo declined to comment, citing the pending litigation.

The company's website now clearly states that the charge for monthly service will be recurring, ‘but it did not do so in 2011,’ the lawsuit states. 

Gogo offers internet services on more than 1,900 commercial aircraft and 6,000 business aircraft. It currently charges $49.95 per month or $14 for an all-day pass.

Those aircraft include all domestic mainline Delta Air Lines and nearly all of Delta's regional jets; all AirTran Airways and Virgin America flights; and select Air Canada, Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Frontier Airlines, United Air Lines and US Airways flights.
