All the excitement seems to have got too much for these fluffy panda cubs - who were all born within the space of just three months at the same breeding centre in China.

After undergoing medical checks earlier this week, the young pandas have been photographed together at Chengdu Panda Base, in Sichuan, for the first time.

One of them, born on the opening day of the London Olympics, was this week named Oreo.

So cute: One of the baby pandas - named Oreo (above) - was born on the opening day of the London Olympics

Oreo, who weighed six 
ounces when he was born, is already up to a stone in weight and
when fully-grown, the plan is to release him into the wild.

'Itâ€™s so exciting to see the seven panda babies together for the first time,' said Aimee Cheung.

Ms Cheung, who is from London, is in Chengdu to take part in the Pambassador competition - a
global contest to raise awareness of panda conservation.

'Oreo is a special cub for me because he was born on the opening day of the London Olympics and because the experts at the Chengdu Panda Base believe he will make a good candidate for release into the wild,' she said.

The names of the other baby pandas are Xiao Qiao, Si Yi, Yuan Run, Miao Miao and two twins Cheng Shuang and Cheng Dui.

Their births bring the number of pandas at the Chengdu Panda Base to 113, making it the biggest group of artificially-bred pandas in the world.

Dr Zhang Zhihe, the centre's director, said: 'We are delighted that 2012 [has] been such a 
bumper year for panda cubs at the Chengdu Panda Base.

'The birth of so many baby giant pandas is a testament to the success of our breeding programme.'

Three 
winners of the Chengdu Pambassador competition will win a 
five-month panda conservation tour of 11 countries working alongside 
Chengdu Panda Base conservationists.
