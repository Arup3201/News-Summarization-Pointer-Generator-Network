A single mother of eight who can no longer have children says she will use a surrogate to have another two – and claim more in benefits.

After putting so much strain on her body by having eight children in 13 years, Marie Buchan has been forced to have a hysterectomy.

But even though she admits struggling to control the large brood she has now, the 32-year-old plans to have two more using a surrogate mother.

Marie Buchan says she will use a surrogate to have another two children and claim more benefits

Miss Buchan, who boasts about how 
easy it is to abuse the benefits system, admits that having a larger 
family will boost her chances of getting a five-bedroom house at 
taxpayers’ expense.

She has also calculated that she will get an extra 
£70 a week in welfare payments.

The mother, who caused outrage last 
year by saying her large family ‘couldn’t survive’ on state handouts of 
more than £26,000-a-year, confessed: ‘It is easy to claim off the state.
 I was devastated when doctors told me I could not have more [children].

‘I love being pregnant and surrounded
 by kids. If I can’t have more babies myself, the next best thing would 
be to use a surrogate. People might criticise me. But it is my right to 
have as many children as I want.’

Unemployed Miss Buchan made headlines
 eight months ago when she complained that her benefits payments – which
 were reduced from £582 a week to £500 a week after the Government 
introduced a cap on handouts – are not enough for her family to survive 
on.

She also said that her £200,000 three-bedroom semi-detached council house in Selly Oak, Birmingham ‘isn’t big enough’.

But despite her complaints, she has 
now admitted life on benefits is ‘easy’ and that she even has enough 
money to buy luxury items for herself and an iPad or tablet for seven of
 her eight children.

She said: ‘Being on benefits gives me an easy lifestyle. I have got more than enough money to pay the bills and feed the kids.

‘I am constantly buying clothes for myself and I like to make sure the kids have nice clothes.

‘I treat them to takeaways weekly and they have all got computer tablets apart from the youngest.’

Crowded: Miss Buchan, who began dating her boyfriend at 14, first became pregnant at 19

She receives more than £2,200 a month
 in state handouts – £440 in child benefit, £1,604 in tax credits and 
£183 in income support, which leaves her with a monthly disposable 
income of £600.

Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of 
the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said last night: ‘People can’t expect the 
taxpayer to pick up the bill if they want to keep having children.’

Miss
 Buchan’s relationship with her former partner and father of all her 
children ended last year because he couldn’t handle the stress of having
 so many children. He now sees them at weekends.

So the young mother is raising Tia, 
12, Leah, 11, Latoya, nine, Joshua, eight, Alisha, six, Mikayla, four, 
Amelia, two, and ten-month-old Olivia on her own.

Miss Buchan, who first became pregnant at 19, had six of her children in seven years, which took its toll on her body.

By her seventh pregnancy she had developed severe back and stomach pain.

A scan revealed the tissue 
surrounding her womb was at risk of rupturing and doctors warned her 
against an eighth baby. However, she went ahead regardless.

She admitted: ‘I adored the attention
 I got when I was expecting and, as I started having more children, my 
benefits money went up – which made it easier to have a good lifestyle. 
The more children I had, the more chaotic it was. But I loved having a 
big family.

‘My friends and family told me I was irresponsible and my partner did not want another baby.

‘But we were lax with contraception and it just happened,’ she told Closer magazine.

‘It is hard work. I am up at 6am to 
get the kids ready for school and often don’t get into bed until 3am 
after I have done the housework.’

After giving birth to Olivia, she was 
warned by doctors that her womb was in danger of collapsing and was 
urged to have a hysterectomy.

Despite having the procedure, it has not deterred her from wanting child number nine and ten.

‘I don’t feel ready to stop,’ she added. ‘I have realised that I could still have children with a surrogate.

I would love it if my ex-partner could be a sperm donor, as I want my kids all to have the same dad.’

The Department for Work and Pensions said it cannot comment on individual cases.

A spokesman added: ‘We are reforming 
the benefits system to make sure those who can work do, and support is 
better targeted at those who need it most.'
