Two families have renewed their campaign to find two teenage girls who vanished on Halloween 45 years ago today.

Patricia Spencer, 17, and her 15-year-old friend Pamela Hobley went missing on October 31, 1969 after going to a high school football game in Oscoda, Michigan. 

The girls had told family and friends that they were then heading to a Halloween party - but never showed up.

The girls, who did not usually hang out together, relatives said, left the school early on Halloween to go to a party but never arrived 

Oscoda High School was subject to a bomb threat that day and family members believed that the girls may have left school early that afternoon. 

According to Missing Persons of America, the girls were not usually known to hang out together.   

Decades after the mysterious disappearance, relatives of the young women refuse to give up hope.

Pamela's sister, Mary Buehrle, told 48 Hours' Crimesider: 'I can't move on. I just hope that someone knows something and will finally have the guts to say something.'

Ms Buehrle said she remembered that night as she had gone trick-or-treating with her mother and other sisters. 

She said her mother, a single mom, was told by Pamela that she was going to a Halloween party with her friends and boyfriend, to whom she had recently become engaged.

Patricia's sister told the show that she believed the two girls were picked up by the wrong person and were murdered. 

Oscoda Township Police Chief Mark David, who took over the case in 2010, also believes that the girls may have been victims of foul play.  

He said that he wanted to bring the girls home to give their families closure after almost half a century of not knowing. 

Pamela's mother died without ever finding out what had happened to her daughter, Ms Buehrle said.

Chief David has combed over hundreds of old statements and tips involving the case that were not followed up upon at the time. He believes that the investigation got off to a slow start because the girls were deemed runaways.

The chief said that when he was a teenager it was rumored that the girls had been buried under a barn in Wilber Township, around 11 miles from Oscoda. 

The tip was never acted upon, Chief David discovered after becoming police chief. Police search teams with cadaver dogs went to the barn but nothing was discovered. 

Another tip from a witness said that he had given the girls a ride in his car but that turned out to be false. 

Last year, a new tip emerged from a witness who said that he given the girls a ride and left them at a gas station on River Road. 

When they were last seen, Miss Hobley was wearing a white fake fur coat wit brown fur trim, a long-sleeved blouse with ruffled cuffs and a brown and white plaid skirt, white kneesocks and shoes with a chunky heel. She had brown hair, brown eyes, a scar on her nose and a birthmark on the left corner of her mouth.

Patricia Spencer has brown hair and blue eyes and wears glasses. She was wearing a brown sweater, gray and green plaid jacket, brown tween or plaid skirt, and brown shoes with a chunky heel. She had a silver necklace with a peace symbol on it.

Oscoda Township Police Department asked that anyone with information call them at 989-739-9113.
