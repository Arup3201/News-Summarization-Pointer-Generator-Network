Beads discovered on a necklace that was first excavated in 1911 have finally been confirmed as being made from space rock.

Researchers from the University College London's Petrie Museum conducted detailed analysis of the necklace using gamma rays and have been able to prove that the beads, originally believed to be made from iron, were in fact created using fragments of meteorites.

The analysis is also the first time scientists have been able to assess how the beads were formed and it is thought that the Egyptians used the technique of smithing and rolling, which involved hammering the rock several times until it could be flattened and then rolled to form the bead-shaped tubes.

Egyptologists from the Open University first scanned beads found in a pre-dynastic cemetery near the village of el-Gerzeh, in Lower Egypt in May, using scanning electron microscopy and computed tomography.

The nickel content of this original metal was found to be high, suggesting that it could have come from a meteorite.

The researcher also observed that the metal had a distinctive crystalline structure called a Widmanstätten pattern.

This structure is found only in iron meteorites that cooled extremely 
slowly inside their parent asteroids as the solar system was forming.

They
 found areas where the weathered surface had fallen away, providing what
 has been described as 'little windows' to the preserved metal beneath.

Researchers from UCL's Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology then used non-invasive neutrons and gamma rays to detect the exact level of nickel and phosphorous in these Egyptian beads.

Lead author of the Journal of Archaeological Science study, Professor Thilo Rehren said that the beads were created by 'multiple cycles of hammering' and not by the traditional carving or drilling stone techniques that were used on other beads found in the same tomb.

Open and Manchester Universities first discovered that the beads contained nickel in May. This image shows a series of scans taken of the iron bead that unlocked the mystery surrounding the presence of iron among the ancient Egyptians. It also poses exciting questions about the way the cosmos influenced their religion

He told Culture24: 'The really exciting 
outcome of this research is that we were for the first time able to 
demonstrate conclusively that there are typical trace elements such as 
cobalt and germanium present in these beads, at levels that only occur 
in meteoritic iron.'

It is also the first time researchers
 have been able to study the internal structure of the beads to reveal 
how they were created - showing an advanced knowledge and skill of metal
 work.

The discovery
 additionally unearths a glimpse of the genesis of the 
ancient Egyptians' religion and the divine attributes they attached to 
meteorites.

'The
 sky was very important to the ancient Egyptians,' said Joyce Tyldesley,
 an Egyptologist at the University of Manchester, UK, and a co-author of
 the paper on the discovery.

'Something that falls from the sky is going to be considered as a gift from the gods.'

Dating from 3350 to 3600 BC,
 thousands of years before Egypt’s Iron Age, the bead analysed was 
originally assumed to be from a meteorite owing to its composition of 
nickel-rich iron.

But this hypothesis
 was challenged in the 1980s when academics proposed that much of the 
early worldwide examples of iron use originally thought to be of 
meteorite-origin were actually early smelting attempts.

The ancient Egyptians would have seen a meteorite as an offering from the gods and this suggests the jewellery may have been created as gifts for royalty or people of high standing

Philip Withers, Professor of Materials 
Science at The University of Manchester, added: 'Meteorites have a 
unique microstructural and chemical fingerprint because they cooled incredibly
 slowly as they travelled through space.

'It was really interesting to 
find that fingerprint turn up in Egyptian artefacts.'

Meteorite iron had profound implications for the ancient Egyptians, both in their perception of the iron in the context of its celestial origin and in early metallurgy attempts.

Dr Tyldesley added: 'Today, we see iron first and foremost as a practical, rather dull metal. To the ancient Egyptians, however, it was a rare and beautiful material which, as it fell from the sky, surely had some magical/religious properties.

'They therefore used this remarkable metal to create small objects of beauty and religious significance which were so important to them that they chose to include them in their graves.'

Egyptians created beads by hammering meteorites into thin sheets

@highlight

These sheets where then rolled into tubes to create 'beads'

@highlight

Meteorite beads predated the discovery of iron ore by 2,000 years

They may also have shaped the ancient people's religious beliefs
