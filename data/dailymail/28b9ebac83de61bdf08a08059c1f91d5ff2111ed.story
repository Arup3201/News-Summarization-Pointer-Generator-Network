If your canine displays attention-seeking behaviour (pictured), you may have a better bond with them than owners with well-mannered pooches

Badly behaved dogs can be a source of embarrassment for their owners.

But if your canine companion displays attention-seeking behaviour, you may have a better bond with them than owners with perfectly-mannered pooches, a new study claims.

The research looked at human-animal attachment among 60 dog-owning families, including parents and children. It is the first study to examine attachment in children in this way.

Participants completed questionnaires to provide details about their attachment to their pet dogs, how responsible they feel towards them, and how often they feed and walk their canines.

They were also asked to rate their dogs on behavioural characteristics such as excitability, trainability, stranger fear and aggression, separation problems and attention-seeking behaviour.

Christy Hoffman, assistant professor of animal behaviour at Canisius College in Buffalo, New York, said that people who care for their dogs well and take more responsibility for them are more attached to their pets than those who have a more hands-off approach.

While this is not surprising, her study also found that the more dogs act out and try to catch their owners’ attention, the more their owners are likely to love them. Interestingly, children were not affected by this behaviour.

‘Children’s attitudes and levels of attachment toward their pets remained high, even when dogs showed low levels of attention-seeking behaviour,’ Dr Hoffman said.

Adults tend to be more selective than 
children in the types of dogs with which they bond ‘due to work-related 
and parental responsibilities that already demand their attention.

‘Thus, adults may only form emotional attachments with dogs that seek out their attention,’ she explained.

Dr Hoffman also discovered that owners have a better bond with their pets if their animal is well trained, but misses them when they are not around. If a dog likes socialising with humans, then the bond between canine and owner is greater still.

The study did not identify any differences between men and women. and found that they are typically drawn to the same dog characteristics and are equally attached to their pets.

Growing numbers of people are being kept awake at night by their pets, doctors have warned.

The respected Mayo Clinic in the U.S. says that while many people sleep peacefully with their pet curled up beside them, some are left so exhausted that they seek specialist help.

Snoring dogs, squawking parrots, wandering kittens, sick pets and animals with weak bladders are all disturbing vital shut-eye.

Pampered pooches may be a problem, as well as more people owning more than one pet.

Some 10 per cent of pet-owners who attended the clinic’s sleep centre in 2013 partly blamed their animals for their problems.

The study’s author, Dr Lois Krahn, a psychiatrist, said: ‘The study determined that while the majority of patients did not view their pets intolerably disturbing their sleep, a higher percentage of patients experienced irritation.

Dogs, cats and birds were the most popular pets and kept their owners awake by snoring, whimpering and wandering.
