An MP was last night accused of insensitivity after he appeared to fall asleep while parliament discussed the deaths of two British soldiers in Afghanistan.

Stephen Pound, the Labour MP for Ealing North, appeared to doze off as the House of Commons heard an urgent question on the war at 3:30pm yesterday afternoon.

As Rotherham MP Denis MacShane asked the defence secretary about the two deaths on Saturday Mr Pound, 64, who is a shadow minister for Northern Ireland, appeared to slowly close his eyes.

Mr Pound, who was sat behind Mr MacShane, then slowly tilted his head to his right before jolting upright.

He then appeared to doze off again seconds later as his eyelids closed and his head tilted to the side again.

Married father-of-two Sergeant Gareth
Thursby, 29, and Private Thomas Wroe, 18, were shot dead in the south 
of Nahr-e Saraj district, Helmand province sparking a furious reaction 
from relatives and MPs.

The MP’s supposed nap provoked a furious reaction from viewers who wrote on Twitter about their disgust.

One
wrote: ‘Wanted to say how upset I was to see an MP asleep in the 
background whilst the Rotherham MP talked about soldiers dying.’

‘did you notice stephen pound having a
sleep when denis mcshane was talking about afghanistan? 
#beinganmpismoneyforoldrope,’ wrote another.

Some viewers sent messages to Labour leader Ed Miliband on Twitter.

One asked him: ‘Labour MP fast asleep during MPs questionning our troops presence in Afghanistan. What are we paying you for?’

Mr Pound last night denied that he had been sleeping.

He said: ‘Dear Lord, have we plumbed the depths? I was on [BBC Radio] 5 Live at four o’clock and was on fine fettle.

'It is impossible to take 40 winks on the back benches. I may well have been concentrating, but I was categorically not sleeping.’

When asked if he may have been recovering from a long lunch, Mr Pound replied: ‘No, I’m totally tee-total. I don’t drink.’

But today Mr Pound insisted the angle of the shots made it appear that he had taken a nap when he was actually checking his phone - despite him appearing to have his arms crossed without a phone in his hand in the footage.

He said: 'The pictures are awful. I was actually looking down at my phone.

'I didn't fall asleep in the Chamber, particularly not in such a sensitive discussion as that. I was obviously looking at my phone.

'I feel dreadful. I have had letters calling me a complete murderous bastard, emails to my general account. It's fairly aggressive stuff.

'Never in a million years would I be disrespectful, particularly on an occasion like that.'
