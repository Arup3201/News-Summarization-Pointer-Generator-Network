Stand in front of a moving juggernaut and you will get knocked over. Sheffield Wednesday headed home having had the heavy tyre treatment.

At half time the team from the Championship were all square and comfortable. In their dressing room at the Etihad Stadium, Stuart Gray’s side may even have been relaxed. 

They had seen little to frighten them from the Barclays Premier League champions.

By the time the new big screen turned from 59 minutes to 60 here, though, Wednesday were four goals adrift and a man short.

By full time it was seven and, moments before that, one of the City team was posing for photographs in the centre circle with the game going on around him.

Frank Lampard was certainly not to be blamed for that little sketch. Seeing a supporter sprinting towards him with security nowhere in sight, the hug he offered was perhaps the best self-defence mechanism open to him and it certainly seemed to work.

Nevertheless, it was an image that summed up the closing stages of the night. City were on easy street by then. Wednesday, sadly, couldn’t wait to get home.

For Lampard, life at his current club continues to improve. His first appearance in the 2-2 draw at Arsenal was rather uncomfortable and ended at half time.

On Sunday, however, he marked an appearance as a substitute against his old club Chelsea with the equaliser. On Wednesday night he scored twice and won the penalty that led to his team’s fourth goal and saw Kamil Zayatte sent off.

‘It’s never a problem trying to get good players like Frank in your team,’ said City manager Manuel Pellegrini. ‘It’s only a problem if you don’t have good players. I was pleased for him. He played very well.’

By the end of the evening, Lampard had certainly emerged as one of City’s stand-out players. The second half was a desperately one-sided affair once the former England international had nudged home a cross from James Milner in the 48th minute.

Prior to that, though, City had provided Gray’s team with absolutely no suggestion of what was coming. The first half had been a pretty even affair that ended with a good section of the City faithful agitated enough to implore their players to ‘get forward’.

Ultimately, City heeded that advice and then some. Once Lampard scored, City moved their machine through the gears and Wednesday were simply rolled over.

Wednesday did rally briefly and City second string goalkeeper Willy Caballero dropped to his left to save from midfielder Giles Coke after Yaya Toure — captain for the night — had conceded a rather unnecessary free-kick on the by-line.

Born in Malaga, Pozo signed for Manchester City from Real Madrid’s youth system in 2012, though Real president Florentino Perez was desperate to keep him. 

The 18-year-old striker, known as ‘Mini Messi’, played his way into Spain’s Under 17s last year, and also topped City’s scoring charts at youth level.

Within minutes, though, City had scored twice more and the game was over.

First Jesus Navas — impressive all night — crossed low for Edin Dzeko to sweep across Chris Kirkland with his right-foot shot before Lampard broke to feed the Spaniard. He carried the ball ten yards before driving a breathtaking shot high into the goal with his right foot from an angle.

After looking comfortable at half-time, Wednesday suddenly looked demoralised.

It threatened to be a testing final 25 minutes and it certainly was once Zayatte was sent off for upending Lampard with half an hour left. That cameo was typical of Lampard’s night. He was actually trying to dummy the ball when it bounced back off his standing leg and prompted Zayatte to make his challenge.

Moments later, Toure scored the penalty and a rout was in the offing.

3 - Burton Albion 

For a while, Wednesday resisted. The outstanding Milner struck a post and then Dzeko blazed the rebound over rather carelessly.

A man down, though, pressure was always going to tell on Wednesday and City went on to score late goals through Dzeko, young substitute Jose Pozo and, in injury time, Lampard. 

Afterwards, Wednesday manager Gray was rueful. ‘We talked at half time about keeping it tight but we made mistakes,’ he said. ‘We are only human and we have ended up with a buffeting.’

By the end, the likes of Pozo and even outcast Scott Sinclair were on the field for City.

It must be noted, though, that Pellegrini started with a very strong team and was ultimately rewarded with a victory that will do his team’s confidence no harm at all.

The juggernaut rumbles on.
