Ministers have launched a crackdown on bogus 'health and safety' rules which ban innoucuous activities, in time for the festive season.

In previous years, workers have complained about being banned from decorating their offices because of supposed Government regulations.

But officials insist there are no restictions on popular Christmas traditions, and they are encouraging members of the public to report the most ridiculous cases to an official website.

Danger? Ministers have urged bosses not to ban office Christmas decorations over health and safety fears

As well as bans on decorations, health and safety regulations have in the past been cited to restrict activities such as carol singing and children's snowball fights.

In addition, over-zealous jobsworths have apparently tried to stop people donating second-hand toys and putting coins in Christmas pudding.

Mike Penning, the minister responsible for health and safety, expressed frustration that bogus cases undermined the importance of rules which are intended to safeguard the public.

'Every year, I hear of more bonkers "excuses" that ban hard-working people from the traditional hanging of Christmas decorations at work - which does nothing more than spoil the festive fun,' he said.

'My message to everyone is - use your common sense. Don't just invent a health and safety myth because you think it's easier than giving a real reason - this gives real safety rules a bad name.'

Myth busting: The Health and Safety Executive has launched a new panel which aims to expose businesses using the excuse of health and safety to impose restrictions on customers

Anger: Minister Mike Penning is leading the crackdown on abuses of legitimate regulations

Mr Penning has written to managers at the Department of Work and Pensions reminding them not to be overly strict when ruling on workplace decorations.

Official advice to the public states that there is no need to take Christmas lights to be tested, and that people should simply examine devices to make sure there are no obvious defects.

The minister urged people to report unreasonable applications of the law to the new 'myth busters' panel at the Health and Safety Executive.

The panel has ruled on more than 220 cases since being launched earlier this year in a bid to improve the reputation of health and safety laws, which have been tarnished by years of abuse.

Among the absurd cases which the HSE denounced were pubs which refused to offer glasses with handles, and a restaurant removing toothpicks from its tables.

One school banned shredded paper from the lucky dip stall at its fete for 'safety' reasons, while a hotel chamber maid refused to make up a cot bed on similar grounds.

In the most recent case, concerning a steam train which blamed health and safety for its failure to accommodate customers' dietary needs, the panel said that workers were 'using health and safety as an excuse for poor customer service'.

Army veteran Doug Speller, 74, was told he was not allowed to stand for the National Anthem during an RAF band concert.

Morris dancers in Bacup, Lancashire face having their annual Easter show cancelled because it is so popular that the crowds sometimes spill into the street.

Binmen refused to collect rubbish from the Wright family, in Midlothian, because their bin was open by one inch.

Heavily pregnant Amanda Burch was banned from wearing a vest top while swimming at a leisure centre - but other women were allowed to keep theirs on for 'religious reasons'.

Ellie Sandywell, 11, had her Help for Heroes wristband confiscated at school because teachers feared it might get caught on a door handle.

Thames Water installed a life ring next to a brook in Surrey in case people fell in - even though it is just three inches deep.

Albert 'Dusty' Miller, an 89-year-old Navy veteran, is no longer allowed to lead Royal British Legion events because his age means he cannot be insured.

A postman in London refused to deliver a letter because the pathway to the house was blocked by a spider's web.

Alan Chittock was suspended from his job as a customer service assistant at Southend railway station after he leaped on to the train tracks to rescue a disabled woman who had fallen.

Dozens of schools are reported to have banned pupils from playing conkers, even though the HSE says the risk posed by the traditional playground game is 'incredibly low'.
