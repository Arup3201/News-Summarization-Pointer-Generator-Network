Yesterday, Lay's chips announced their four new wacky flavors, as voted for by consumers for its annual Do Us A Flavor contest.

The bonkers range includes Cheddar Bacon Mac & Cheese, Kettle Cooked Wasabi Ginger, Wavy Mango Salsa, and most confoundingly of all, Cappuccino flavored chips.

Femail were quick to get our greedy mits on all four of them, to see if we could predict which one would reign supreme.

The line-up: For this year's Do Us A Flavor contest, Lay's have announced four new flavors - Cheddar Bacon Mac & Cheese, Kettle Cooked Wasabi Ginger, Wavy Mango Salso, and most confoundingly of all, Cappuccino

A quick glance at the facial expressions of our testers indicated that two flavors in particular were causing a bit of a raucous - and not in a good way.

The Wavy Mango Salsa chips were wrong on every level; overpoweringly fruity, described by one staffer as 'like eating lip balm,' and loathed by everyone else who had the misfortune of trying them.

Potentially even more horrific however, was the Cappuccino flavor, which amassed only two fans; both of whom were widely attacked by the rest of us for their ill-judgement.

Losers: The Wavy Mango Salsa's fruity flavor (left) did not go down well with any of our testers, while the sickly sweet - caffeine-free - Cappuccino version (right) caused an uproar of disgust

'It's sweet, but it's a chip! I hate it!' cried out one tester. 'I can't even put that in my mouth,' claimed another, upon giving the open bag a whiff.

'It's sweet, but it's a chip! I hate it!'

Thick with the taste of cinnamon and more sugary than a traditionally savory snack should ever be, at least one tester spat theirs out.

The Wasabi Ginger flavor divided us. Obviously if you are not a fan of wasabi, this is not the chip for you. But I found them to be tangy, citrussy and delicious - and probably the most innovate flavor pairing.

Winners: The Wasabi Ginger chips were praised for their innovative balance of sushi-inspired flavors, while the Bacon Mac & Cheese chips were enjoyed by everyone for being the safest, least-peculiar of them all

Which makes the Cheddar Bacon Mac & Cheese flavor the winner of Femail's road test. Perhaps for being the safest option, it was praised for its reassuringly familiar smoky bacon taste, and found itself not a single hater.

The person who invented the most popular flavor will win Lay's Do Us a Flavor contest, and bag themselves a whopping $1million.

All four flavors will be hitting stores later this month and people can vote for their favorite online through October 18.
