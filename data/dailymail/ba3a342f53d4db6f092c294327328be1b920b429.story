Furious pensioners have been ordered to replace their letterboxes for health and safety reasons - at a cost of £350.

Residents at Sweetbriar House in Gloucestershire were called to a meeting by housing association Jephson and told their letterboxes no longer complied with fire safety rules.

The company said changes must be made to meet new fire regulations and it asked a contractor to provide the quote as a 'goodwill gesture'.

But the 32 residents - aged between 55 and 90 - said they are unable to afford the quote and have slammed the company for the 'rip-off' request.

A spokeswoman for Jephson was unable to explain the difference between the existing and proposed letterboxes - but said the current ones did not comply with regulations.

Walter Griffiths, 67, said: 'This is absolutely ridiculous.

'I don’t know anybody who would pay that money for a letterbox and there are quite a few people that are going to refuse to do it.

'They seem to find expensive ways of doing things. Everybody here is over 55 and we have people who are 90.

'There are a lot of people who don’t have an awful lot of money and just their pension to live on - they are not rich people.'

The leasehold homes in Churchdown, Gloucestershire were built in 1988 and are let by Jephson.

The company said the upgrades need to be carried out after an independent consultant’s assessment found the letterboxes no longer met fire regulations.

Residents said they had been told that while the letterboxes themselves cost between £50 and £90 it would take a day to fit just two - bumping up the price with labour costs.

Jephson said the quote was simply a 'ballpark' figure and there was no deadline for residents to carry out the improvements.

A spokeswoman said: 'As the residents own their flats within the scheme, they are responsible for these properties.

'Their obligations, which include ensuring their homes comply with fire regulations, are included in their lease agreement.

'The safety of residents is of paramount importance to us and we have a duty of care to those living in the buildings we manage.

'We have therefore advised people living at Sweetbriar House to carry out this work in accordance with their lease agreement to eliminate what has been independently identified as an area for concern.

'If they choose not to, there is the risk that - in the event of a fire - someone may be injured or even killed.

'At the request of some of the residents, we asked an independent contractor to provide a quote for this work. Residents are under no obligation to use this contractor.'
