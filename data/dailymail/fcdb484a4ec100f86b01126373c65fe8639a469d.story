Police have vowed to spend another two years tracking down the rioters and looters who ransacked England's streets.

Those who thought they had escaped the law by now should not rest easy as police have pledged to trawl through 40,0000 hours of CCTV footage in a bid to bring every single person involved to justice.

Officers have promised to pursue each offender they can identify, The Times reported.

Police are determined to track down every single suspect, and have resorted to using big screens, like this one outside the Bull Ring in Birmingham, as part of their investigation

But it is anticipated that some of the more difficult cases will take years to complete.

Scotland Yard say that so far 2,006 people have been arrested in connection with the rioting and looting.

Of those 1,135 have been charged, with 954 of those cases appearing before a court, 82 have been sentenced and 42 have been jailed.

But the investigation is far from over, as police are determined to use every scrap of evidence they can find from CCTV, which has been heavily criticised as being unnecessarily intrusive and imposing a 'Big Brother' watch on society.

Police are seizing the opportunity to showcase just how effective the surveillance cameras can be in helping to combat crime.

Already they have set up dedicated websites filled with CCTV images of suspects' images, using social media websites including Twitter to encourage people to view the pictures and 'shop a looter'.

Police are not daunted by the hours of CCTV they will have to trawl through, or suspects' attempts to disguise themselves, as they vow to hunt down every rioter and looter

They have broadcast CCTV images and video on huge billboards and used vans with screens attached to publish footage.

Police say their campaign to catch those involved has been overwhelmed by members of the public who have eagerly come forward to inform them of suspects.

The Times reported dedicated officers are ploughing through 10,000 hours of CCTV material while cameras in the Bull Ring shopping centre in Birmingham have 743 hours of material.

Detective Chief Inspector Steven Reed, of West Midlands Police, told the newspaper they would not rest until they had searched every avenue to identify offenders.

And Detective Chief Inspector Kevin Concannon, from the Met's riot investigation, Operation Withern, told the newspaper harnessing the power of CCTV was crucial.

'There is a wider debate about CCTV but in this investigation it is absolutely core, it's critical.

'We're looking at footage where people have made little or no effort to disguise their faces.

'Sometimes they pulled up a scarf or a hood just before they go into a looted shop, then 50 metres down the road they take it off again, or they'll get into a car with the registration number clearly visible.'

Crackdown: Armed Pelle, left, and Anderson Fernandes, right, have already been tracked down and jailed. Pelle was punished for inciting violence on Facebook, while Anderson was imprisoned for taking a lick of  stolen ice cream

Already the police have shown just how determined they are to track all of the rioters and looters down.

A teenager who used Facebook to encourage the 'killing of a million police officers' during the riots has been jailed for 33 months.

Amed Pelle incited his 2,000 friends on the site to commit violence and looting in Nottingham.

He asked if any of them 'wanted anything' from a fashion store that was later targeted.

The jobless 18-year-old posted three messages on his Facebook 'wall' on August 9, hours before serious disorder broke out in his home city.

The first two read 'Nottz Riot whose onit?' and 'Kill one black youth, we kill a million Fedz (police), riot til we own cities'. It is believed the second message was a reference to Mark Duggan, whose death in Tottenham sparked the original trouble.

In his third message, Pelle wrote: 'Rioting 2nyt anyone want anything from (fashion chain) Flannels?' The store, in Nottingham city centre, had its windows smashed hours later.

Pelle had pleaded guilty to a breach of section 44 of the Serious Crime Act 2007, doing an act which was capable of encouraging or assisting the commission of an offence, namely violent disorder. 

Judge John Milmo told Pelle that his comments 'encouraged attacks on the people of Nottingham as a whole, and the people of other cities.'

Upmarket shop: Fernandes walked into this Patisserie Valerie in Manchester and helped himself to a cone and two scoops of ice cream

Sentencing the teenager to two years and nine months in a young offenders' institution, he added: 'Your offence was designed to, and could well have led to, increased numbers on the street intent on violence to persons and property.

'An element of deterrence is called for in cases like this. A clear signal needs to be sent out that criminal conduct of the kind demonstrated in these cases is out of order and will not be brushed under the carpet.'

His sentence came as a looter who took just one lick of an ice cream he stole during rioting before he gave it away was jailed for 16 months.

Anderson Fernandes, 21, wandered into an upmarket store in central Manchester after the door was left open and helped himself to a cone and two scoops.

But despite giving it to a passer-by because he didn't like the coffee flavour he was still given a lengthy prison term.

The sentence will fuel fears that courts are meting out disproportionate justice to those caught up in the disorder.

Yesterday Manchester Crown Court was told that ice cream thief Fernandes, 21, was arrested after raiding Patisserie Valerie because he left DNA behind at the scene.

He admitted burglary and an unconnected charge of handling a stolen vacuum cleaner after his arrest.

The court heard that Fernandes had already appeared in court charged with possessing drugs and an offensive weapon on the same day he got mixed up in the disorder.

Michael McQuillan, defending, said: 'He is remorseful and fully accepts how serious the matter was and why courts take such a serious view of this type of behaviour.'
