Taylor Moxey may only just have turned eight, but already she's firmly in charge of her sky-rocketing culinary career.

Based in Miami, Florida, Taylor has made thousands of dollars from her famous, handcrafted cupcakes - catering for clients including Citibank and HGTV's Bobby Berk, reports ABC Local 10 .

'If I have a client, let's say on Monday,
 and I get home early, I start baking because I also have dance', says 
the busy mini-chef, who donates part of her impressive profits to 
dyslexia awareness.

Taylor may be beyond adorable, but her cooking is no child's play, and her thriving business is well-earned.

Demand for her fares rose steeply after 
Taylor won the KISS Country Midtown Miami Cornbread Competition, beating
 out trained adult chefs to take home first prize.

Following her win, hoards of fans came in search of a little slice of her baking heaven, and with some minor help from her parents, Taylor has become something of a local celebrity.

The little rising star takes tips from TV chefs, enjoys watching 'a lot' of Food Network and keeps herself motivated with her inspiration board, spending her evenings not only baking, but also hand-decorating her cupcake boxes.

'The rest of my cooking career is just.... to go off and fly free'

And her ambitions for the future are clear as can be.

'The rest of my cooking career is just.... to go off and fly free', she grins. 'And to open my own bakery.'Â
