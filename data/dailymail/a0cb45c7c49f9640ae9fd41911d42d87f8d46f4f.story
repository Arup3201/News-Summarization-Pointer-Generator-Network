Mom Centerria Manning was home with her young daughter Calise when she collapsed after suffering an epileptic fit.

During Calise’s seven and a half minute call on Wednesday she remains very calm as she explains that her mom is having a seizure, and gives security services the family's home address in Kalamazoo.

'She's shaking and she's having a baby,' Calise told the dispatcher. 'My mom is really pregnant and she's having a boy and she really needs help.'

Because of her epilepsy, Centerria explained that she has been preparing her daughter for what to do if she witnessed mom having a fit since she was two years old.

With Centerria's fiance Terrell Ballard at work when she began seizing, brave Calise followed through exactly with what her mom had told her and made her very proud in the process.

‘She was like, “I told you I was gonna take care of you if something happened,'" Centerria said.

Not only did young Calise save her mom’s life but also that of her baby brother who wasn’t yet born.

Centerria was taken to Borgess Medical Center and on Friday morning she gave birth to T.J., a fit and healthy 7 pound, 7 ounce baby boy.

Wearing an 'I'm the Big Sister' T-shirt, Calise said she couldn't be prouder.

'He's cute and I really love him,' she said.

On Sunday Calise received a special award in church for her bravery and keeping very calm in a scary situation.
