Roy Keane is poised to return to the Premier League - as Paul Lambert’s assistant at Aston Villa.

The former Manchester United midfielder turned the job as Celtic manager but is on the brink of a move to Villa Park.

Keane had been expected to be appointed as Neil Lennon’s successor at Parkhead after talks but the 42-year-old instead chose to work with Lambert, as the role would allow to also continue as Martin O’Neill’s No 2 with the Republic of Ireland.

Lambert and Keane held talks before Celtic’s failed attempt to land their former midfielder and he will replace former assistant manager Ian Culverhouse, who was sacked last month.

His new role at Villa Park, where he will try to help the club improve on their miserable 15th place finish last season, may also be able to accommodate his role as ITV’s top pundit on Champions League nights.

Reports in Ireland have stated Keane had a formal offer in front of him from the Scottish champions but a source close to Celtic claimed: ‘Roy was not offered the job - no-one has been offered it yet. But he has ruled himself out and asked not to be considered for the position.’

The FAI then released a short statement confirming Keane would remain with them after the recent frenzy of speculation over his future.

It read: ‘The Football Association of Ireland today confirmed that Roy Keane will travel with the Republic of Ireland squad to the US after he decided not to pursue the informal talks that took place with Celtic any further.’

Former West Bromwich Albion manager Steve Clarke is now the favourite for the Celtic job.
