A cyclist says he was treated like a 'burglar or child batterer' by police after he was arrested for riding his bicycle without lights.

Edward Copland, 38, of Blackpool, Lancashire, was stopped by officers as he cycled along the pavement on his way home from working as a shop manager.

Police said he was taken to the police station after becoming abusive and 
then held in the cells before being charged and bailed over long-standing laws on the time of day a bicycle should have lights.

Now the Crown Prosecution has thrown the case out in a hearing that lasted just two minutes.

'I was treated like a burglar': Lytham Road in Blackpool, where Edward Copland, 38, of Blackpool, was stopped by officers as he cycled home

Senior Crown Prosecutor Alison Quanbrough told magistrates at Blackpool just before Mr Copland was due to enter a plea: 'I am somewhat surprised to see this allegation in court today.'

'I do not believe it is in the public interest to continue with this prosecution and ask to withdraw it.'

Justices agreed and defence lawyer Steven Duffy said: 'That is a common sense approach by my colleague - greater common sense than was shown when my client was arrested and then processed through the custody system in the cells.'

A police spokesman said the cyclist 'became abusive towards the officer and refused to give his details'. File picture

Mr Copland called the arrest, which happened at about 7pm on Tuesday October 29, a 'waste of public money' adding: 'I was treated like a burglar or child batterer.

'OK, I did not have my lights on and would have admitted that.

'I was cycling home in the rain after a busy day. I had forgotten to put the lights on my bike because the clocks had changed that weekend.

'It was a mistake but I found myself being treated like some master criminal on a major drugs deal.'

'I had reason to believe the police were over the top arresting me when a caution or fixed penalty would have done.'

'I suppose they did not like it when I asked them "havenâ€™t you got anything better to do?".'

A police spokesman said: 'Mr Copland was stopped on Lytham Road in Blackpool for using a cycle without lights at night.

'He subsequently became abusive towards the officer and refused to give his details and he was therefore arrested and later charged with the offence.'

He added that Mr Copland was held for an hour.

Mr Copland added: 'I was perhaps a bit sharp but it did not warrant me being taken off the streets and processed through the custody system.

'I was told by one custody officer in the cells there were 25 others awaiting processing and I would be 26th.'

'It's not been a great time for me as I have just been laid off by the shop. But the CPS were right. It is a victory for common sense and the public purse.'
