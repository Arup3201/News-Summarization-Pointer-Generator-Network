A four-month old baby was kicked off a Disney cruise ship after falling ill after medical staff told her parents that she shouldn't be on the trip anyway because of her age.

Jennifer Moak was on a Florida to The Bahamas voyage with her husband Dan and baby as part of a 31-strong group enjoying a holiday for an elder family member with terminal illness. 

However two days into the trip, Mrs Moak's four-month-old baby fell ill, and was taken to see the ship's doctor.

Jennifer Moak, her husband Dan and their four-month-old baby were told to leave the Disney cruise ship

The baby was administered medication, however a couple of hours later the family were contacted my medical staff to be told that the four-month-old would have to be taken off the ship.

In the summer, the minimum age of passengers on board Disney Cruises was raised from 12 weeks to six months, however the company said existing bookings would be honoured if the ages didn't fit in with the new rules.

The Moaks, from Naples, Florida, claim they were told by medical staff, however, that the decision had been taken because of the baby's age, and that it would be safer to visit a hospital.

The family were put up in sub-standard accommodation in Nassau, where the three had to share this bed

Mr and Mrs Moak were allegedly told their four-month-old baby was too young to be on the Disney cruise

Speaking to Naples News, Mrs Moak said: 'He (medical staff) said because of her age, she wasn't supposed to be on the ship and that they would be — I think the word that he used was 'terminating' our stay on the ship.'

While the family were confused as to why the baby's age had been raised as a factor despite being told it wouldn't come into play, what followed in terms of a contingency plan from Disney caused them a great deal of distress.

Having paid almost £700 ($1,000) a night for the cruise, the family were checked into a hotel in Nassau, that the father described as a 'fleabag motel.'

Worryingly the parents were forced take their baby into bed with them as there was nowhere else for the infant to sleep. This came after having to plead for a child car seat on the journey there.

After being told they must leave the ship, the standard of provision the Moak's received was not up to scratch

Mrs Moak's father, Dave Berg, who disembarked along with his sick grandaughter added: 'No one can believe that Disney would send a four-month-old baby off into the dark in a foreign country that they say in their brochures is dangerous.' 

However, Disney refute the suggestion that the child's age was  a reason, telling FoxNews that 'the child was not removed due to her age but because the on-board doctor felt the child needed medical care at a land-based hospital.'

After checking in to a Bahamian hospital, the baby was merely diagnosed as having wind, yet the Moaks were left with a £1,200 medical bill.

The family added that they have been left upset with Disney's handling of the situation, and are yet to receive an apology.

MailOnline Travel have contacted Disney and are awaiting a response.
