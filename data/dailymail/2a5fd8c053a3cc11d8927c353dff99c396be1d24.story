Battling: Brook Hill is in a coma in a French hospital after a ski collision on a junior slope at the Les Monts d¿Olmes ski resort in the south of the country

A nine-year-old boy is in a coma after being knocked down by a skier on a family holiday in the Pyrenees.

Brook Hill was enjoying a beginners’ skiing lesson on a junior slope at the Les Monts d’Olmes ski resort in southern France when the accident happened.

The youngster, who was wearing a helmet, was knocked unconscious by a 27-year-old man who lost control and ploughed into him at high speed.

Brook was airlifted to a hospital in Toulouse where he has had an operation to remove a section of his skull to relieve pressure on his brain.

The other skier suffered broken ribs and a punctured lung and is recovering in hospital. Police have launched an investigation into Sunday’s accident.

Yesterday, his entrepreneur father Louis, 40, said doctors have told him they cannot be sure of the extent of the brain damage until Brook wakes up.

Mr Hill, of Wrenbury, Cheshire, said: ‘Brook is stable and we are hoping he wakes up soon.

‘He’s a tough little chap and a real fighter, so our fingers are 
crossed.

'He has not, as yet, opened his eyes and 
‘woken up’ so things still remain in the balance and doctors are 
reluctant to give any prognosis until he can answer questions or respond
to instructions.

‘It is still early days and doctors are advising any recovery is
likely to be a long process.’

Accident: The resort of Les Monts d'Olmes is popular with families because the slopes are relatively easy

Brook, who attends the White House 
School, in Whitchurch, Shropshire, was half-way through his first skiing
trip with his father, mother Rachael, 42, a nutritionist and health 
writer, and brother  Barney, 12.

Brook Hill, who plays for Whitchurch under 10s rugby team in Shropshire, has been inundated with messages of support

The
sports-mad youngster, who was player of the year at Whit-church 
under-10s mini-rugby team last year, has been inundated with messages 
from well-wishers, including his hero, the Welsh  international rugby 
full-back Leigh Halfpenny.

A popular pupil, his family and friends have been writing messages of support and jokes on a website which his parents are reading aloud to the schoolboy, who is in intensive care.

His uncle, Paul, of Tattenhall, Cheshire, added: ‘We are so grateful Brook was wearing a crash helmet.

‘In all honesty, we all ignorantly 
believe that such accidents only happen to other people, and it’s a big 
wake up call when it’s one of your own.

‘As
a family we really believe in the power of positive thinking and the 
amount of people who tell us they are sending good vibes to Brook is 
overwhelming.

‘Brook is very lucky to have such warmth around him.

‘It’s
very difficult to determine the damage to Brook’s brain while he is in 
the coma, so we are willing him to wake up so we can figure out what the
next step is.

‘Listening to music and jokes will be a constant part of his routine until we have another development.’

Monts-d’Olmes is a small resort in the Ariege department, around one-and-a-half hours’ drive from Toulouse.

Its slopes are especially popular with families with young children, because all are relatively easy.

The resort was particularly busy on Sunday because it was the first weekend of half-term holidays in France, and other European countries.
