An accused serial rapist beat sex assault charges over 20 years ago because of a freak accident.

Van Draylan Dixson, 39, now linked to four of a possible nine serial rapes in a south Dallas, TX., neighborhood, beat a rape charge in the early 1990s after the victim was struck by lightning. This revelation was made just as he was taken into custody Friday morning in Baton Rouge, LA.

Mr Dixson was also suspected in a tenth rape in the Fair Park neighborhood, but officials appear to have moved in a different direction with that investigation.

On the run since this past weekend, Mr Dixson was spotted outside a downtown Baton Rouge hotel and immediately arrested, according to reports. It will take a couple of days for him to be extradited back to Texas to face rape accusations.

The former neighbourhood watch captain was wearing the same gold-rimmed glasses that victims described their attacker as wearing, NBC DFW noted. Officials found him after an anonymous tip.

Just as the accused serial rapist was being taken into custody, NBC DFW reported that he beat sexual assault charges in the early 1990s after his accuser was struck and killed by lightning.

‘The case made a deep impression on me,’ Colleen Skinner, the former prosecutor probing the case told the station in the original rape case told the station. ‘It was just so brazen.’

The victim dying made it impossible to prosecute, Ms Skinner said.

‘My hands were tied,’ said Ms Skinner. 

‘Even if the rape kit had shown he was the perpetrator, I would need a witness to tell the jury that it wasn't consensual,’ she added. ‘I would need a witness to tell me, `He forced me.' I would need a

witness to testify, `It happened in Dallas County,' she explained.

It has also been revealed that the DNA 
sample voluntarily given by Mr Dixson prior to his disappearance has now
linked him to four of a possible nine rapes, police said.

Police told local media that they believe Dixson ended up in Baton Rouge because he couldn’t afford to go any further.

‘The only indication we have is that this was as far his money would allow him to go – because he had very little money on him when we did apprehend him’ a US Marshall’s Office spokesperson said during a press conference in the city.

Also previously reported were Mr Dixson’s prior arrests, of which his neighbors were unaware.

The ex-con served over 10 years in prison after a 1993 armed robbery conviction, a police spokesperson told NBC DFW. He was also arrested last month for deadly conduct after he pointed a gun at someone.

Calling Mr Dixson’s arrest a ‘relief to the community,’ Alendra Lyons, president of the Mill City Community Association – the neighborhood watch group Mr Dixson patrolled the Fair Park area for at night, told the station that she plans to look into criminal background checks for new recruits.

‘At least we would be aware of what they have dealt with in the past,’ added Ms Lyons.

Mr Dixson is currently in federal custody in Baton Rouge and awaiting extradition, which can take a few days.

Spokespersons for both the Dallas and Baton Rouge Police Departments could not be reached for further comment.
