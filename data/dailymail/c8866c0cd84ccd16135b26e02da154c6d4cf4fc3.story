Celebrities and millionaires who were happy to drop $250,000 to travel into space on Richard Branson's highly ambitious SpaceShipTwo still plan on taking the trip even after Friday's horrific explosion.

As Branson arrives at the site of the tragedy in California, some of his ticket buyers have come forward to let it be known they trust Virgin's head honcho, and are still excited and ready to travel to space, this although flights have yet to even be scheduled.

Branson had previously said of his program, and those who wanted to get involved and travel to the final frontier, 'Everybody who signs up knows this is the birth of a new space program and understands the risks that go with that.'

On Friday, Branson announced on the Virgin Galactic site that  refunds would be available following the tragedy.

That being said, no one has yet to back out, and many are still excited to get their astronaut wings.

Ashton Kutcher was one of the first celebs to book his ticket, and the 500th person overall, something that got him a special blog post from Branson at the time.

'He is as thrilled as we are at the prospect of being among the first to cross the final frontier (and back!) with us and to experience the magic of space for himself,' wrote Branson on the Virgin site at the time.

Other celebrities who are set to fly include Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Russell Brand, Leonardo DiCaprio, Princess Beatrice, Tom Hanks, Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, Lance Bass and Justin Bieber.

Bieber was so excited at the time he bought his ticket that he said he wanted to 'shoot a music video in space.' 

None of these celebs have commented following Friday's tragedy.

Speaking with the New York Times, Patricia Hynes, director of the New Mexico Space Grant Consortium, said Friday's incident 'helps people understand why it’s never been done before.'

As for whether or not it changes her mind to fly, Hynes, who already has purchased her ticket said, 'No, absolutely not.' 

Jim Clash, a journalist who is also one of the 700 ticket holders, seemed to echo Hynes' statement, telling Mashable, 'Stuff happens. I'm not going to change my perspective on selling my ticket back, or not sticking with 'em, I just think it's - You never know.' 

Branson is expected to speak later this day at a press conference in California.
