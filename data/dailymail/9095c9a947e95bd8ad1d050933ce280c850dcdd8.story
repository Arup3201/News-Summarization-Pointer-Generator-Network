Alabama state officials are investigating a complaint of alleged elder abuse of acclaimed author Harper Lee as controversy continues to rage over whether the the 88-year-old really wants to publish a new novel.

Since HaperCollins announced the new book last month, many have questioned whether Lee, famously reluctant to seek publicity, would really have a follow-up to her classic 'To Kill a Mockingbird' over more than 50 years. 

Many claim her mental health is not sound enough to endorse such a proposition while another says she is backing the release of the new book, 'Go Set a Watchman.'

Controversy over the author's mental state has raged since it was announced she would publish a book after more the half-a-century without a new novel

The New York Times reports investigators have interviewed staff at the Meadows assisted living facility where Lee resides as well as friends and acquaintances.

A doctor who asked to remain anonymous said he had filed a complaint after knowing Lee for two years and believing her infirm.

He said he had been told she was mostly incapable of communication.

Such investigations can involve law enforcement if financial exploitation can be shown. 

One person speaking to the Times anonymously said Lee seemed to understand the investigators and give clear responses.

As the investigation continues, people have argued for several different pictures of Lee: funny, depressed, witty, confused, or even varying from day to day.

She reportedly had a stroke in 2007 resulting in health and vision problems. 

'It’s a call only God or a doctor can make,' attorney Philip Sanchez, who was a pallbearer for older sister Alice's funeral, told the Times. I am more concerned that Nelle is content than the discussion of her cognizance.'

Accounts of Lee's mental and physical state have been contradictory 

A friend of Lee, Wayne Flynt, said he visited her recently and found her mentally cogent.

But he agreed she had some health issues, telling him 'I'm not so sure anymore,' in response to a congratulations on the new book.Lee has only given statements about the novel through her attorney, Tonja B. Carter. Carter handled the book deal and declined to respond to interview requests.
