They are said to taste like asparagus, celery or fennel when cooked and were eaten by the Aztecs, who praised them for their taste and health benefits.

And now growers - who have spent two years developing edible dahlias - say they can be substituted for any potato dish. 

The dahlias will be on sale from March this year and come in six varieties - Hoamatland, Black Jack, Kennedy, Sunset, Buga Munchen and Fantastic.  

Growers have spent two years developing the edible dahlias after taking inspiration from the Aztecs, who would eat the bulbous roots of the common garden blooms for their taste and nutritional value

Swiss growers Lubera are urging amateur gardeners to plant the dahlias by May so that when the flowers die out at the end of the summer they can eat what's left of the plant.

The six varieties each has with its own taste. Some are said to taste like asparagus when cooked, while others taste similar to celery and fennel. 

They're also healthy because they're packed full of carbohydrates.

The edible dahlias, called DeliDahlias cost £4.99 for a 1.3-litre pot of young flowers.

Dahlias are easy to grow and will thrive in a wide range of soil types and situations.

They are best planted in fertile, well-drained soil in full sun in May to early June. Planting could be carried out slightly earlier in southern counties or later in the north of England and Scotland.

The trend for eating dahlias died out in the 1700s when the colourful flowers were brought to Europe and they became popular for their ornamental qualities rather than their taste.

Growers advise planting the dahlias in May so that the roots can be eaten by autumn, when the flowers die

A spokesman for Lubera said the company had spent two years working with Austrian dahlia Peter Haslhofer to develop its range of edible dahlias.

He said: 'The Aztecs used the dahlia tubers as food. They knew they tasted wonderful and that they were healthy.

'When the dahlia was bought over to Europe on 1700s it became more of an ornamental flower.

'But now, more than 500 years on, we have made an attempt to renew this tradition and to select the best dahlias for eating.

'We have spent the past two years working with Austrian dahlia breeder.'

He added: 'Amateur gardeners no longer need to be sad when they dig up their dahlias in autumn. Although the festival of flowers is over, the eating adventures can begin.

'If you plant should the young dahlias in May, by autumn you will be able to enjoy eating the tubers.

'They can be used as a substitute for potato in any dish - you can have them steamed, boiled, mashed, baked or roasted, and they're full of carbohydrate for energy.

'With our DeliDahlias you get two for the price of one - beautiful flowers and tasty dinners.'
