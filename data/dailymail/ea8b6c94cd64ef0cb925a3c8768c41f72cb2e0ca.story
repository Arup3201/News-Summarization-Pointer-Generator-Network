Banks are still starving businesses of the cash they need to thrive in a serious threat to the economic recovery, figures showed yesterday.

The Bank of England said lending to British firms fell by £3billion in April - the biggest slump so far this year.

Lending to small businesses was down £660million in yet another sign that the government’s flagship Funding for Lending Scheme is not working.

The programme was launched by the Treasury and the Bank in August last year in an effort to get £80billion of cheap loans out to households and businesses.

There is evidence that mortgage lending has increased but small firms in particular continue to be deprived of the funds they need to grow and create jobs.

Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ‘The Funding for Lending Scheme has not driven a recovery in borrowing yet. We continue to think that a strong and sustained economic recovery will remain elusive so long as overall bank lending remains this weak.’

The figures showed that lending to British businesses has fallen by more than £100billion since the start of 2009 in a punishing setback for the economy.

The crisis has been highlighted by the Daily Mail’s Make the Banks Lend campaign which was launched nearly three years ago to draw attention to the desperate plight suffered by small firms at the hands of their banks.

Banks insist many companies do not want to borrow money because they are too scared about Britain’s uncertain economic future.

But experts dismiss the claim as nonsense and the FLS was beefed up in April to focus on lending to small and medium-sized businesses - known as SMEs.

John Allan, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said relying on the ‘big five’ banks - HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds, RBS and Santander - ‘is clearly not working’.

He said: ‘To get the recovery on a firmer footing businesses need to access finance and greater competition in the banking sector should help this. Business confidence is up, suggesting firms want to invest but to do this many need the finance to make it happen.’

Bank governor Sir Mervyn King, who retires at the end of this month after 10 years in the job, has admitted that the changes to the FLS are ‘not a gamechanger’.

More than half of small firms in some parts of Britain have been rejected by their bank for a loan over the last two year, according to a recent report by the research firm BDRC Continental.

Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said the latest data from the Bank showed why officials felt the need to extend the FLS.

‘The FLS has so far failed to have any material impact in lifting bank lending to companies.

‘Of course, it needs to be borne in mind that low lending levels to companies have reflected weak demand as well as supply factors.

‘How much companies want to borrow going forward remains questionable, but it is important for UK growth hopes that all companies who are in decent shape and who do want to borrow - whether it be to support their operations, lift investment, explore new markets - can do so, and at a non-punishing interest rate. This applies to all companies, whatever their size.’
