While waxing and grooming of pubic hair has long been de rigueur, the increasing popularity of  labioplasty and other cosmetic procedures for women's private parts suggests that the appearance of the nether regions is becoming something of an obsession for appearance-concious women.

However the latest product to hit the market aimed at the transformation of 'greying' feminine areas may be a step too far for some.

My New Pink Button is a cosmetic genital dye that claims to be able to restore women's labia to a 'youthful pink'.

My New Pink Button is a temporary genital dye designed to correct 'greying' and restore a 'youthful pink' to a woman's nether regions

Available to buy on Amazon for £23 ($36.95), My New Pink Button comes in four shades, 'Ginger', 'Marilyn', 'Bettie' and 'Audrey' all packaged in a Fifties-style tin.

The dye is temporary and is applied with an applicator to the area where it takes effect immediately.

While one may question where the idea for such a product came from, the website states that the 'patent pending formula' was designed by a certified Paramedical Esthetician after she discovered her own genital colour loss.

While looking online for a solution the website says she discovered 'thousands of other women' asking the same questions regarding their colour loss.

After much research she could unearth no solution and, after a discussion with her gynecologist, she decided to create her own.

'Now there's a solution!' the website crows, as if it were they had found the answer to some question we'd all been asking.

Each so-called Dye System Kit includes 20 disposable applicators, a mixing dish, the labia colourant and an instructional guide.

The four shades of dye mean you can pick the level and intensity of change - ranging from Marilyn at the lighter end to Audrey at the darkest.

Three of the four shades are currently out of stock on the website, with only 'Ginger' still available

The darkest shade is described as for the 'woman who wants to be daring' to give a 'bold burgundy pink colour'.

'Perfect for everyone, and your own base colour will determine the depth of this shade. Tonight it's Show time!!' the website states.

However for those less willing to make a statement with their lady-parts there is Marilyn 'for beginners'.

Many of the top rated customer comments are decidedly tongue-in-cheek

Marilyn is described as perfect for those 'who want to make a slight, fresh colour change in their appearance or those who are very fair skinned' while Bettie prompts a more exciting description.

The website says: 'Think of that favourite lipstick you wear for
those dressy black tie affairs and think "Bettie". This shade blends
with a woman's own skin tones to bring out that "sexy hot pink, I am fired
up, look". Go dancing this weekend and remember to bring "Bettie"
along!'

But those who have discovered the product for sale on Amazon have had mixed reactions, with most of the top rated customer reviews taking a slightly tongue-in-cheek attitude to the existence of My New Pink Button.

Despite the understandable cynicism surround the necessity of labia dye, nearly all the shades of the dye have sold out, with only two pots of 'Ginger' remaining in stock.
