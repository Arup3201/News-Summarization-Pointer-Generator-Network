David Cameron's new slate of female ministers marched into Downing Street today in a dramatic reshuffle of Parliament that sees eight women now with a place at the Cabinet table.

While Cameron has said his reshuffle is about putting in place a team that continues to deliver the long term economic plan, it also brings a touch of style to Number 10.

Make way for Nicky
 Morgan, the new Education Secretary, Liz Truss, the new 
Environment Secretary, employment minister Esther McVey, who will attend 
Cabinet, and Anna Soubry, Priti Patel, Clare 
Perry, Amber Rudd and Penny Mordaunt, who famously took part in ITV's 
Splash!.

Glamorous: The newest member of the Cabinet Esther McVey MP strikes a pose as she leaves Downing Street

Looking good: Esther McVey MP is among the female MPs promoted to Cabinet in the latest reshuffle

Leading 
the style set is Esther McVey, who looked chic in a grey Vivienne 
Westwood dress with her long blonde hair perfectly coiffed. 

The employment minister who will now attend Cabinet looked ready for action as she arrived at Downing 
Street this morning.

The
 Conservative MP for Wirral West is one of a number of rising stars 
promoted to Cabinet positions in today's reshuffle - and one of the most
 glamorous.

A
 former GMTV presenter, Ms McVey, 46, looks set to give home secretary 
Theresa May, herself a fashion fan, a run for her money in the style 
stakes.

Ms McVey is partial to a fabulous pair of shoes; picking a dove grey pair of suede wedges for her meeting with the prime minister.

As a former TV presenter, McVey knows exactly how important image is, and will no doubt have picked out her outfit with care. And while the minister for employment and disabilities has often spoken of her love for fashion, she boasts a CV that's just as impressive as her wardrobe.

Powerful purple: Penny Mordaunt, the new Junior Minister at the Department for Communities and Local Government, wore a purple wrap dress, reminiscent of the Issa design that the Duchess of Cambridge covets

And Ms McVey certainly isn't the only fashion fan among the women promoted today by David Cameron. J

Joining her - and the always impressive Theresa May - at the Cabinet table is Loughborough MP Nicky Morgan.

The new Education Secretary looked chic and summery in a fitted black dress and brown blazer.

Nicky accessorised her flattering outfit with a thin waistbelt and nude court shoes, a style loved by the Duchess of Cambridge.

Penny Mordaunt, the new junior minister at the Department for Communities and Local Government, had an air of the Duchess of Cambridge about her in a purple wrap dress, reminiscent of the Issa design that Kate loves. 

Much like the former Kate Middleton, she wore nude court shoes and carried a matching purple tote. 

Then there's South West Norfolk's Liz Truss MP, who becomes Environment Secretary. She arrived in a stylish blue snakeskin blouse, blue pencil skirt and salmon pink blazer.

She accessorised with classic black court shoes and a blue handbag. Both women are sharp dressers who have brought businesslike wardrobes featuring neat pencil skirts and serious tailored jackets to their high-powered roles.

Here come the fashionistas: (L-R) A vibrantly dressed Clare
 Perry becomes a junior transport minister, super chic Baroness Stowell becomes 
leader of the House of Lords and glossy Anna Soubry is promoted to Minister of 
State at the Ministry of Defence

Cameron is dotty for you: Priti Patel, a former aid to William Hague when he was Tory leader, joins the Treasury as Exchequer Secretary and wore a polkadot dress for the occasion

Amber Rudd is promoted to a junior ministerial berth at the Department for Energy and Climate Change. 

She channeled the androgynous trend in a blue suit, simple white top and chunky blue necklace.

Clare Perry becomes a junior transport minister and toasted the occasion in the season's hottest colour: blue.

She wore a navy dress, which she teamed with a vibrant blue blazer, statement necklace and beige wedges.

Baroness Stowell becomes leader of the House of Lords and wore a blue dress and polka-dot blazer for the occasion.

Another 
polished politician to join the crew is Anna Soubry, who is promoted to 
Minister of State at the Ministry of Defence. 

She showcased her fashion 
credentials in tailored black trousers, cream blouse and tweed blazer, 
which she accessorised with pearls and an over-sized tote.

Priti Patel, a former aide to William Hague 
when he was Tory leader, joins the Treasury as Exchequer Secretary and 
wore a polka-dot dress for the occasion.

The new-look Cabinet looks set to be a very stylish place to be.
