Sainsbury’s has apologised after one of its stores dressed a mannequin in a 'slave outfit' to promote the sale of the 12 Years a Slave DVD.

The Heyford Hill store in Oxford has now been forced to remove the display after a Twitter backlash.

The supermarket chain has since said sorry for the tasteless promotion stand, adding that 'it should clearly have never gone up'.

Sainsbury's has apologised after one of its stores dressed a mannequin in a 'slave outfit' to promote the sale of the 12 Years a Slave DVD. The Heyford Hill store in Oxford has now been forced to remove the display after a Twitter backlash

It featured a barefoot headless mannequin wearing an outfit similiar to that worn by Solomon Northup, the main character of Steve McQueen’s film.

The Oscar winning epic graphically depicts the brutality of slavery.

The model was wearing a beige shirt and cropped black trousers, with a twig in its pocket, and was placed on a stand selling DVD and Blu-ray copies of the film.

Around the model's neck is a sign saying 'new' - although it is not clear whether the clothes themselves were on sale as part of the promotion.

The display was photgraphed and shared on Twitter, where it was roundly condemned as appearing to promote 'how to get the slave look'.

A Sainsbury’s spokesman said: 'We can only apologise.

'It’s been taken down from the Heyford Hill store and clearly should never have gone up in the first place.'

A spokesperson later confirmed that the outfit had never been on sale in the store as part of any promotion associated with the film.
