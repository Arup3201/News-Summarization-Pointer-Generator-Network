The look on Tony Pulis’s face when his West Bromwich Albion team conceded their first goal under his tutelage suggested it will not be happening all too often in future.

West Brom are into the next round courtesy of a rare Victor Anichebe double, but Birmingham pulled one back when Jonathan Grounds found space in the area to slip a finish in off the post.

At that moment, in first-half injury time, Pulis spun round with anger in his eyes. A cardinal sin had been committed, his defenders too slack.

Overall, he can be happy after his side avoided an upset against neighbours Birmingham, reinvigorated by Gary Rowett’s arrival.

This was a fixture that excited England’s second city. St Andrew’s was a sell-out for the first time since Birmingham faced Blackpool in the play-off semi final of May 2012.

West Brom could have sold many more than their 5,467 allocation, who travelled five miles from west to east. Team selections from both Rowett and Pulis matched the expectation.

Each went with largely full-strength line-ups, Ben Foster and Clayton Donaldson the only major players to start on the bench.

The pubs and roads around this stadium were packed prior to kick-off with supporters chanting various songs against their local rivals – but in the ninth minute they were united in applause for Jeff Astle.

West Brom fans have kept up their campaign calling on the FA to launch research into the effects of heading footballs following the death of their legendary striker.

Away from this game, Pulis has his focus on the transfer window – and as if to show the areas he wants strengthening immediately, he played Joleon Lescott at left-back and Craig Gardner on the right wing, shifting Chris Brunt to the middle.

After a quiet opening, the match sprung to life in the 25th minute.

Craig Dawson won possession and the ball found its way to Saido Berahino. The England Under-21 forward slipped a delicate pass to Anichebe, who shifted his body so Paul Robinson was unable to block his shot, which went in off the near post.

Ten minutes later, Anichebe doubled his tally in similar circumstances. Once again Berahino played in his strike partner on the left of the area. Anichebe muscled his way past Robinson and squeezed a finish into the far corner. On neither occasion did goalkeeper Darren Randolph cover himself in glory.

Anichebe, a £6million signing from Everton in August 2013, had only scored four goals prior to the arrival of Pulis. He now has three in four under the Welshman.

That seemed to be that. West Brom do not concede under Pulis, and looked secure here until added time in the first half.

But Lloyd Dyer, on his debut, escaped the attentions of Andre Wisdom down the Birmingham left and delivered a low cross that somehow reached Grounds by the 12-yard spot. The left-back struck a first-time finish for his first goal in a Birmingham shirt. Pulis spun away with anger in his eyes.

Birmingham under Rowett are resilient and made a decent job of a comeback after the interval. The hosts’ cause was aided by three injuries to West Brom players in 15 minutes. First Gardner caught Davod Cotterill’s free-kick flush in his face to require treatment, then Boaz Myhill was forced from the field with an injured hand after being clattered by Dyer. Foster came on to claps from both sets of fans.

In the 68th minute Birmingham captain Paul Robnson was fortunate to stay on the pitch when he launched a crude tackle on Stephane Sessegnon that saw Mark Clattenburg produce a yellow card and the West Brom winger substituted.

Randolph was forced into a magnificent save from Lescott’s header, and Chris Brunt struck the outside of a post from a tight angle when through

But Birmingham held the ascendancy the rest of the time. Demarai Gray, the 18-year-old winger, was sent on with 20 minutes to play and enhanced his reputation.

With 11 minutes to go he cut inside Gareth McAuley and unleashed a shot that Foster tipped over, and he also brought a fine save from the England goalkeeper with a tremendous drive from distance.

In injury time Stephen Gleeson hit one that flew past the post, and Pulis could allow himself a smile.
