Incredible footage shows a bus driver being launched through the windshield of his city bus in Albuquerque, New Mexico, after it was hit by a truck that ran a red light. 

The collision last Friday caused the bus to slam into a large concrete column marking Route 66.

The driver, who was not wearing his seat belt, was thrown out of his seat and through the bus's smashed windshield. He came to a rest with the top two-thirds of his body dangling out of the bus. 

Brace for impact: The driver tries to regain control of his city bus after it was hit by a pickup truck that blew through a red light

The driver was nearly thrown entirely out of the bus when it smashed head-long into a concrete column on the roadside

Miraculously, both the bus driver and the driver of the truck were able to walk away from the violent crash - suffering only minor injuries.

The video, obtained by KOAT-TV, shows both the collision from the outside and the jarring wreck from the inside of the bus.

A silver pickup truck can be seen shooting across the intersection and t-boning the city bus. 

Police say that the driver ran a red light. 

External cameras also caught the truck running a red light and t-boning the bus

The drivers of both vehicles suffered only minor injuries. After the crash, the bus smashed into a concrete column, where it came to a rest

The incredible impact forces the bus off the road. As the driver dries to regain control, the bus slammed into a concrete column.

Police told the Albuquerque Journal that the intersection where the crash occurred is busy with pedestrians and it's lucky that the pillar stopped the bus because anyone was injured. 

One driver told the newspaper that it was the worst bus accident she'd ever seen the New Mexico city.
