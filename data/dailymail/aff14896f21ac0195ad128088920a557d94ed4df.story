The dancer who was on the bridge when the Costa Concordia cruise ship hit a reef killing 32 people, has admitted at the captain's manslaughter trial that they were lovers.

Domnica Cemortan also told the Italian court that she boarded as a non-paying passenger hours before the crash near the island of Giglio, saying: 'When you are someone's lover no one asks you for a ticket.'

She dismissed the remark as a joke to her translator.

Moldovan Miss Cemortan said she had worked on the Concordia for three weeks in December 2011.

The Moldovan dancer admitted she was Captain Francesco Schettino's lover and boarded the Costa Concordia without a ticket

She tried to dodge the question of whether she was romantically involved with captain Francesco Schettino, and only responded positively after being told she risked criminal charges for refusing to reply.

Earlier the trial heard that the ship hit the reef after Schettino was disappointed at not getting close enough to it on an earlier attempt, his trial has been told.

Crew member Maitre d'Antonello Tievoli, who comes from the island of Giglio, said he asked the captain to make a close pass as a favour to his family who lived there.

Mr Tievoli said Schettino obliged on January 6 last year, but decided the Concordia had not been close enough and ordered his No. 2 officer to plot a closer route next time.

Exactly a week later, the Concordia smashed into the reef off Giglio and capsized. Schettino has blamed the helmsman for the botched manoeuvre.

The sinking of the Costa Concordia in January last year is one of the worst maritime disasters in living memory.

The frantic moments before the cruise liner hit rocks were revealed in court yesterday.

Schettino is said to have cried out 'Madonna, what have I done?', as the cruise liner hurtled into rocks off the coast of Tuscany.

Captain Francesco Schettino, who was in command of the ship on the night of the disaster, reacted with disbelief on the impact, asking fellow officers â€˜Did we hit a reef?', according to a recording played in court in Grosseto, Tuscany.

Schettino, 52, is facing 20 years jail time if convicted of dereliction of duty and multiple counts of manslaughter.

His lawyers argue that he is not solely responsible for the tragedy.

Salvage operators in Italy lifted the Costa Concordia cruise ship upright from its watery grave off the island of Giglio in September, in the biggest ever project of its kind

Moldovan dancer Miss Cemortan had always denied an affair with the Captain even though her suitcase and bikini was found in Schettino's cabin.

The 950 tonne ship was wrenched off the rocks last month in a mammoth operation and is expected to be removed from the island after the winter.
