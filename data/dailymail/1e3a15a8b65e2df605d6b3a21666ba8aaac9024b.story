Bojan Krkic wasn't to be distracted by a green laser being shone at his head while taking the penalty that saw Stoke beat Everton in the snow at Goodison Park.

Already a controversial spot-kick with the Toffees complaining to referee Lee Mason that the Spaniard went down too easily under the challenge of James McCarthy, Bojan stepped up to take it and clinically put his shot beyond keeper Tim Howard.

Bojan appeared unperturbed by the green light coming from his left, presumably from an Everton fan, as he approached the ball. However the guilty party appeared to lose aim at the moment the diminutive forward made contact with the ball to successfully slot into the bottom left corner.

Lasers are hardly new to the sport, with recent high profile incidents including Russia's unceremonious exit from the World Cup in Brazi after which manager Fabio Capello, the former England boss, blamed a laser beam for their loss to Algeria.

Footage backed up Capello's complaints that goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev had been put off by a laser directed at his eyes when Islam Slimani headed the equaliser in the key group H match.

'You can see that in the footage. This not an excuse, it is a fact. There was a laser. I have never come up with excuses to get by in my entire life,' Capello said after the match.

In the recent Asian Champions League final second leg in Saudi Arabia, the visiting Western Sydney Wanderers won the hard way with keeper Ante Covic having to deal with lasers flashing in his eyes throughout the match, which ended in a brawl as Al Hilal players reacted poorly to the defeat.

While often seen in European competitions, the Premier League has been relatively free of the unsporting fan accessories up to this point.
