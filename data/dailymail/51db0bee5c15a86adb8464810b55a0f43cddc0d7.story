Germany's Martin Kaymer defeated Bubba Watson in a sudden-death play-off to win the PGA Grand Slam of Golf in Bermuda on Wednesday.

Kaymer, who held a two-shot lead over Masters champion Watson following an opening 65, birdied the first extra hole at Port Royal Golf Course after the pair had finished tied on six under par.

The US Open champion holed from six feet on the par-four 18th hole and then saw Watson miss from half the distance to extend the play-off.

'Yes, of course I was surprised that he missed it,' said Kaymer, who also beat Watson in the singles in Europe's Ryder Cup victory at Gleneagles last month.

'I had a similar putt earlier in the regular round, just half an hour before we were standing there in the play-off. But his was a little bit longer and I knew that it's not an easy putt.

'On my putt it was quite an advantage that I had the similar putt earlier, just a little bit longer, but pretty much the same line and I knew it didn't break as much as I thought. So that helped me a lot. It was a good stroke and so it went in.

'But I was surprised about him, obviously, you don't want to win a golf tournament that way. Of course I will take it, but you don't really want the other guy missing a short putt.'

Watson added: 'I thought I hit a great putt. There's no way that ball should go that way, unless it's wind forced. It's just one of those things. It was Martin's time and not my time.'

Watson also held a two-shot lead with two holes to play following birdies on the 14th, 15th and 16th, only to drive into water on the 17th and run up a bogey six, while Kaymer birdied the same hole.

World number one Rory McIlroy, who won the Open Championship and US PGA this year, struggled to a 75 to finish two over par, one ahead of Jim Furyk.
