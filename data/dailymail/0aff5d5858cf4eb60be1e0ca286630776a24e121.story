Call him the social media president – maybe.

Jeb Bush, the moderate former Republican governor of Florida, launched a political action committee on Tuesday with a Facebook rollout and a website that asks for visitors' Instagram usernames.

The 'Right to Rise' PAC, Bush said in a Vine-like Facebook video, will 'support candidates who believe in conservative principles.'

He will begin filling its coffers Wednesday night in tony Greenwich, Connecticut, a 1-percentages' paradise where his father, former President George H.W. Bush, grew up.

GROUNDWORK: Jeb Bush (second left),  shown at the Jan. 2 swearing-in of his son George P. Bush (2nd right) as Texas land commissioner, is readying a presidential campaign with the launch of a leadership PAC

POWER COUPLE: Craig and Debbie Stapleton, shown chatting with France's then-Culture Minster Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres (right), are hosting Bush's PAC fundraiser on Wednesday; Mr. Stapleton was President George W' Bush's ambassador to France and, before that, to the Czech Republic

'We will not cede an inch of territory – no issues, no demographic groups, no voters,' the PAC's website says in calculated pre-campaign language, while promising to 'unite our citizens to strengthen America through greater economic growth and widespread prosperity.'

'We believe in the transformative power of conservative ideas to renew America,' it adds.

So-called 'leadership' PACs are different from presidential campaign committees. Their funds can be disbursed to other politicians' campaign committees. But the PACs can't coordinate its activities with any of them.

Bush's move will help him build a war chest to curry favor with Republican Party insiders, help he'll need it he officially joins the 2016 White House race.

The Right to Rise PAC can also spend money to pay a growing Bush enterprise's staff, commission public-opinion polls, and even foot the bill for Bush's travel as he crisscrosses the country in search of financial backing.

It also puts him on equal footing with other probable contenders. Every other major GOP pol who has generated presidential media buzz already had a leadership PAC.

Bush is also making a play at retail politics, soliciting donations on his PAC's website. 

'Hey everybody,' he says in his Facebook video. 'Today we're setting up the Right to Rise PAC which is a PAC to support candidates that believe in conservative principals to allow all Americans to rise up. If you're interested, go to righttorisepac.org.'

In a second version of the video, Bush says the same thing in Spanish.

He became the first prominent Republican, in December, to talk openly about his presidential aspirations.

CBS News noted that the name 'right to rise' may be the creation of Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan, the 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee. 

Bush quoted Ryan in a 2011 Wall Street Journal opinion essay.

'Congressman Paul Ryan recently coined a smart phrase to describe the core concept of economic freedom: "The right to rise",' he wrote then.

'Think about it. We talk about the right to free speech, the right to bear arms, the right to assembly. The right to rise doesn't seem like something we should have to protect. But we do. We have to make it easier for people to do the things that allow them to rise. We have to let them compete.' 

Politico reported Tuesday that allies of Bush are readying the launch of a separate 'super PAC' that will help him head off efforts by Senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, and a longer list of governors, to muscle him out by locking in the early support of potential high-dollar donors.

Some of his rivals may ultimately reconsider their chances as Bush collects his checks. Super PACs have no contribution limits.

FAMILY AFFAIR: A Jeb Bush presidential run would likely pick up the same full-throated support from the Bush clan that marked his campaigns for governor; at this 2002 rally, then-first lady Laura Bush, his sister-in-law, showed up to speak

The process begins Wednesday night for Bush in Greenwich at the home of Craig and Debbie Walker Stapleton.

Mr. Stapleton is a former U.S. ambassador to France and the Czech Republic under former President George W. Bush – Jeb's brother.

Mrs. Stapleton is Bush's cousin.

The event's 'host committee' is another who's-who of Bush-era government. It includes Richard Breeden, who chaired the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under George H.W. Bush, Jeb's father.

David McCormick, the president of Bridgewater Associates – the world’s largest hedge fund – is also on that committee. McCormick was a Treasury Department under secretary during the George W. Bush presidency

“It will be an opportunity to discuss the Governor’s background, his future plans and most importantly, ask questions,” read an email invitation to the event obtained by the Connecticut Post.

Attendees are being asked to contribute $5,000 apiece.
