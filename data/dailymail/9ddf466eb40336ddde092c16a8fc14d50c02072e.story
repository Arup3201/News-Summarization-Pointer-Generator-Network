A fit and healthy 41-year-old man died after a routine hernia operation in which the anaesthetist was 'too proud' to ask for help when the patient suffered an anaphylactic shock, an inquest heard.

Jamie Hyde, from Morchard Bishop, Devon, died after suffering a rare reaction to a general anaesthetic during the routine operation at Tiverton and District Hospital.

Anaesthetist Dr Andrei Rebrov did not realise initially that he had  suffered an anaphylactic shock and so Mr Hyde went for more than one hour without being given potentially life-saving treatment.

The inquest into his death in Exeter, Devon, heard how Mr Hyde's heart rate and blood pressure began rising and falling rapidly after he was given the anaesthetic.

At one point his heart rate fell to 30 beats per minute and nurse Lizzie Charlton-Ann suggested calling 999.

But the inquest heard that Dr Rebrov refused to do so and instead called the critical care unit at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital in Exeter. He also turned down an offer of help from another doctor on site who was also an anaesthetist.

Mr Hyde later went into cardiac arrest and was given CPR before being transferred to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital where he was placed on life support having suffered brain damage.

His family turned off his machine on May 27, 2013, after he stopped responding to tests.

Dr Rebrov said he had received training on how to deal with anaphylactic shocks but had not encountered one before.

Coroner Elizabeth Earland asked Dr Michael Seymour, the surgeon who was in the operating theatre at the time, whether Dr Rebrov froze.

He said: 'I don't think he froze, I think he reacted to the situation he was in but one of the problems was whatever he tried to do, worked for a while then Jamie deteriorated again.'

Mr Hyde was moved to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital in Exeter, Devon (pictured) and was put on life support after suffering brain damage, the inquest heard. However, he died a few days later on May 27, 2013

The coroner heard how Mr Hyde had not been worried about the hernia operation beforehand and had expected to return home the same day.

Mr Hyde's sister Catherine told the inquest that she believes Dr Rebrov was 'too proud' to ask for help when complications arose.

She said: 'When I first saw Dr Rebrov at the hospital he was very upset and tearful. He said Jamie was a very nice guy.

'I felt sorry for him, but now I feel he was too proud to ask for help.'

Nurse Ms Charlton- Ann said: 'I have always had it drummed into me from working on the ward to call 999 any time you think a patient's life is in danger.'

Dr Earland, who delivered a narrative verdict, said strenuous efforts were made to save Mr Hyde.

She said: 'At the time, the doctor who had administered the drugs did not know he was suffering an anaphylactic reaction as he was not displaying the usual symptoms.'  

Following the inquest, Martin Cooper, medical director at the Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust, told MailOnline: 'We wish to express our condolences to Mr Hyde's family and recognise his death was tragic. 

'The coroner concluded that his death was due to the effects of an unexpected and very rare anaphylactic reaction.

'The Trust undertook full investigation into the circumstances. 

'The results of this investigation were explained to the coroner, together with the actions that the Trust had taken to improve the management of anaphylaxis in the operating theatre situation.'

Mr Cooper said improvements included surgery teams receiving further training and additional drugs used in anaesthetic emergencies being made available.

He said the Trust had also rolled out a programme to community theatre staff in 'critical incident' training.
