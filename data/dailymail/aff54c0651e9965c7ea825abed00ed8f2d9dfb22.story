Thousands of people have been evacuated from their homes in Munich as experts today tried to defuse a 550lb Allied bomb dropped on the city during WW2.

The undetonated explosive was found beneath ground at the site of the former Schwabinger 7 nightclub, a hangout of the Rolling Stones in the 1970s.

Bomb disposal teams fear its complex chemical fuse could trigger a repeat of the 2010 tragedy when three experts were killed in a blast in another German city.

Close up: The bomb, which was dropped by either American and British planes in either 1944 or 1945

Team leader Diethard Posorski said: 'That is a chemical delayed-action detonator. I am not defusing that - I’m not suicidal.'

So, rather than defusing the bomb, experts plan to surround it with sand and carry out a controlled explosion as the site.

 2.8million tons Weight of all U.S. and British bombs dropped on Germany (54% USAAF)

75,000 tons Weight of Luftwaffe bombs dropped on Britain

543,000 Germans lost their lives in WWII air raids

60,000 Britons killed by German bombs

390,000 Sorties flown by RAF bombers

2,500 unexploded bombs yet to be found in Munich, according to experts

5% The proportion of bombs that failed to detonate

A large timber shell was today built around the bomb, which is believed to have been dropped in 1944 or 1945 by either British or American forces.

The controlled explosion is likely to take place tomorrow morning.

Only then will the 2,500 people living within a 1,000-yard radius of the site in the Schwabing area close to the city centre.

A nearby subway station has also been closed as well as parts of Leopoldstrasse, one of Munich’s busiest streets.

It is unknown whether American or British planes dropped the bomb, which was discovered as diggers tore a building down.

Both countries used the same type of 550lb explosives and rust is understood to have obscured any identifying marks.

During the war Royal Air Force and U.S. Army Air Force are estimated to have dropped around 50,000 bombs on Munich.

City officials believe that 2,500 unexploded payloads – around 5 per cent of the total dropped - are still buried in the Bavarian capital.

Precaution: The bomb, which cannopt be defused, is covered with sand bags ahead of a planned controlled blast

Cordon: A German police officer guards a section of Leopoldstrasse, which has been sealed off along with a a 1,000-yard radius area. A total of 2,500 people have been evacuated

And they pose a huge problem in all of Germany, where barely a week goes by without a new discovery.

It is unusual, however, to find a bomb in such a densely populated areas as most undetonated explosives tend to be uncovered outside big urban zones.

Allies dropped of 2.8million tons during WWII, massively eclipsing the 75,000  tons unleashed by the Luftwaffe on Britain.

By the war’s end, the USAAF had dropped 1.5million tons of bombs on the country and the RAF 1.3million tons. British bombers alone flew a total of 390,000 sorties.

Locked out: Evacutated people in an aid station in Munich, where they will have to stay until Wednesday

Round-up: German police officers evacuating apartment buildings after the bomb was found

Sealed off: Recovery vehicles parked on Leopoldstrasse, which has been blocked to traffic

As a result, few towns escaped extensive damage from air raids and, by 1945, 543,000 civilians had been killed by the allied assault, compared with 60,000 in Britain.

The worst air raid occurred in Dresden when, over two days, at least 30,000 civilians were killed in attacks by the RAF and the USAAF.

Last week a similar 550lb bomb was found in Nuremberg and experts fear that the dud payloads are becoming more dangerous due to ‘material fatigue’.

Already 67 years have passed since Germany’s defeat and over time the safety elements in the trigger mechanisms are increasingly wearing away.

It means that some bombs could explode before being discovered and others will be more difficult to defuse.

In the most deadly incident in recent years, three bomb disposal experts were blown to bits in June 2010 as they attempted to defuse an American bomb in the northern university city of Göttingen.
