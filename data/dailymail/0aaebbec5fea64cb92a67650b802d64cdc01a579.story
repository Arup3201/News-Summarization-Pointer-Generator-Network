When Matthew Deane and his family moved into their Utah home, they were constantly harassed by teenagers throwing toilet paper at their house.

The torment got so bad, their 15-year-old daughter decided to leave her school in the town of Oakley.

So when some of the culprits were caught by the police, instead of pressing charges, they asked them to donate the rolls instead.

Since then they have received more than 1,000, after the campaign spread on social media and the toilet paper throwing has stopped.

A family who were tormented by toilet paper throwers when they first moved into their Oakley, Utah, home told the culprits to donate the rolls, now they have received over 1,000 after the campaign spread

Matthew and Liz Deane were harassed late at night for four months, but when police officers caught those responsible, they decided against pressing charges 

Mr Deane said he would wake up to find up to 13 rolls draped over the trees in front of his family home 

Talking to Fox 13, Mr Deane said that groups would throw up to 13 rolls on his house at a time.

As it went on however, they started to bang on the windows in the early hours of the morning and would wake up to find his garden furniture torn apart.

'It was really frustrating because we didn’t know everyone involved, we didn’t know why,' he told the station. They felt invincible and we felt very vulnerable.'

In early December, police officers caught some of the culprits during one of their 'papering' sprees. 

Mr Deane and his family decided that, instead of pressing charges, they should ask them to bring toilet paper to the house.

People have driven to the family's home especially to hand over their paper, which is going to the nearby Kamas Food Bank 

Mr Deane said he was happy that a bad situation had been turned around into one that was beneficial and of service to the local community

The harassment came to an end, and instead of winding up in the trees, the toilet paper will be donated to the Kamas Food Bank.

Their idea then started to spread on social media, prompting others to donate their rolls. 

He told Fox: 'One man has driven up from Salt Lake twice with toilet paper. We had a really crappy situation and we took it and turned it into something nice and happy and beneficial and of service.'
