A drunken reveller spent Hogmanay behind bars after he was caught snorting cocaine in the back of a police car.

Unemployed salesman Steven Downie was arrested shortly before midnight on Hogmanay after officers spotted white powder on his nose.

The 20-year-old was clearly under the influence of alcohol and drugs and was placed in the back of a patrol vehicle.

Then, in full view of police, he snorted coke from his hand.

Downie, from Perth, in central Scotland, admitted possessing cocaine on December 31 last year.

Fiscal depute Robbie Brown told Perth Sheriff Court yesterday: 'At 11.30pm the officers saw the accused and they stopped to speak to him.

'He was clearly heavily under the influence of alcohol or drugs. They could see white powder round his nostrils. His behaviour became such that he was arrested.

'He was in the vehicle being taken to the police station when he was seen snorting powder from the back of his hand. Two bags containing cocaine were found on him.'

Solicitor Nicky Brown, defending, said: 'You will see the date - he had been at a party. He had bought this for £30 at the party.

The incident involving Downie happened over New Year in North Methven Street in Perth, central Scotland

Perth Sheriff Court heard Steven Downie was arrested shortly before midnight on Hogmanay after officers spotted white powder on his nose.

'He had consumed far too much alcohol. When they came into town he came to the attention of police.'

She told the court he normally worked in sales but was currently unemployed.

Sheriff Lindsay Foulis said: 'It's not something you want to get in the habit of, taking cocaine. Aside from anything else, it can often affect your behaviour and make you become aggressive and confrontational.

'Ultimately, it's not cool. It affects your health and if you want confirmation of that you should come to this court on days when you see folk who have been taking drugs for numerous years.

'They may only be 35 but they look like they are 65,' he said.

Downie was fined £300.
