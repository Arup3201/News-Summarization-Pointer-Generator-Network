Just seconds had passed after the final whistle before one thug decided to hop the barriers, charge towards Nottingham Forest’s victorious players and start swinging.

The Derby fan threw two punches at defender Kelvin Wilson — failing to land either — before being rugby tackled to the ground by Jamaal Lascelles and then escorted away by stewards.

This east Midlands derby is one of the most frantic rivalries in British football but the last thing it needs is idiots like this. The man was arrested and faces a life ban.

It was an afternoon to forget for home supporters. Their team had surrendered a lead — anyone who has watched Derby this season will know that is a rarity — and lost to their worst enemy.

Defeats cut deep and the strife between the two teams continues to grow year-on-year. The roots of this intense rivalry are said to lie in the Industrial Revolution when John Heathcoat from Derby invented a machine that copied hand-made lace but as soon as the patent ran out Nottingham entrepreneurs stole the idea.

The hatred was famously stoked by Brian Clough. In 1983, Clough, in his time manager of both clubs but then at Forest, told defender Willie Young: ‘Just do one thing for me, Willie. Play well in this match and I won’t ask another thing of you.’

Charlton might be in disarray after the sacking of Bob Peeters, but Watford’s charge under Slavisa Jokanovic continues apace after a 5-0 thumping. Odion Ighalo, who spends his career out on loan from the Pozzo family-owned Udinese, scored twice, with Craig Cathcart, Troy Deeney and Daniel Tozser also finding the net. The Hornets are in the top six, winning five of their last seven Championship games. 

But Forest lost 2-0 — against a team led by Clough’s old ally Peter Taylor, no less — and the manager lost it in the dressing room.

Derby players had been pelted with coins and bottles by fans that day and running battles broke out near the train station. Situations are more controlled now but for Forest manager Stuart Pearce this fixture takes on added importance, much in the same way as it did for Clough.

Pearce is the man who says he is ‘entrenched’ in Nottingham and in 1989 claimed he’d rather sign on the dole than play for Derby. ‘No disrespect but I could never work for that club in any capacity.’

He was rather more dignified at the iPro Stadium on Saturday after seeing his players fight his corner after an impassioned speech in the hotel beforehand.

‘You’ve either got to play for me to hear a team talk or you’ve got to pay a lot of money to come and listen to me at a leadership conference!’ he smirked when asked to reveal what he said. ‘Otherwise I’m not telling you.’

Pearce might have been telling us the reasons for parting with Forest had he not conjured a response from his players. They’d won just twice since September and were continuing to stagnate with no signs of revival. After securing a late winner, for once Pearce didn’t need to go firefighting.

‘In some ways we might have to build and emulate Derby,’ he said. ‘They are an outstanding side, built over five years, from Nigel Clough’s days. Steve (McClaren) has taken the team on and they are a very good side. They have a fantastic set-up at this club.’

Forest owner Fawaz Al-Hasawi found his tyres had been let down and a number plate ripped off his car afterwards.

‘I don’t mind at all. The three points are more important,’ was his response, though Forest may seek compensation for the damage. There was nothing deflating about the visitors, though, who showed they may have the guts to match their manager’s style. Pearce chose not to celebrate afterwards, adding: ‘I just go inside myself, enjoy the moment, then look to go and win a game on Wednesday. I don’t drink, I gave up 11 years ago.’

He could have done with a stiff one after hauling himself from the brink.

Derby could count themselves lucky they were not behind early on. With the score at 0-0, Jake Buxton pulled Michail Antonio to the ground with a tackle more suited to the rugby field, but the referee gave nothing. 

WHAT'S CAUGHT MY EYE...

Scunthorpe suffered the misfortune of losing first-choice goalkeeper Sam Slocombe to a broken arm in their 2-0 defeat against Bristol City, only to find substitute James Severn suffer the exact same fate before half-time. Defender Andrew Boyce ended up in goal for 48 minutes and City only scored their second late on.

Yeovil have finally won a game. Their last victory came on December 13 but a winner from Gozie Ugwu, on his debut, saw Gary Johnson’s side record an impressive win against Bradford.

Chant of the weekend has to go to the Oldham fans at Fleetwood Town. The hosts were mocked for their fishing heritage, with Latics supporters singing: ‘Pies are sustainable.’ It got worse for Graham Alexander’s Cod Army, who lost 2-0 and are in danger of falling away in mid-table.
