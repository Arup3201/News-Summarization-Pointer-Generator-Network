Barcelona have announced that Sergio Busquets will inherit their No 5 jersey from retired former club captain Carles Puyol.

It was 36-year-old Puyol, now assistant sporting director at Barca following his retirement earlier this summer, who suggested to the club that Busquets be handed the now legendary shirt number.

Legendary: Barcelona's most decorated era came with Puyol as captain

World Cup-winner Busquets, 26, has been 
an integral part of Barca's first-team since being handed his debut by 
Pep Guardiola in 2008.

The holding midfielder has worn the No 16 jersey for the past five seasons but will don No 5 for the first time in Saturday's friendly at Nice.

Busquets said: 'It is an honour to wear No 5, and also an honour that Carles Puyol thought that I should inherit it.'

Puyol had worn No 5 at the Nou Camp since 2002, making 481 of his 593 Barcelona appearances with it on as he won six La Liga titles and three Champions Leagues.

He inherited it from fellow former Spain centre back Abelardo Fernandez.
