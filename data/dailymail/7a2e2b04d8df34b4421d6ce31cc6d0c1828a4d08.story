A fascinating new book has revealed how an anonymous elite FBI hostage rescue team leader led the charge of capturing the Boston bomber.

The Virginia-based leader, who the FBI later requested not to be identified by name, was called to the Watertown backyard of David Henneberry shortly after the resident had discovered a body in his boat.

With 'firmness and unexpected humility' he took charge of the high-stress situation, leading dozens of FBI agents and SWAT officers to successfully bring Dzhokhar Tsarnaev out alive.

According to an excerpt of Long Mile Home: Boston Under Attack, the City's Courageous Recovery, and the Epic Hunt for Justice, published in the Boston Globe, the FBI leader's unit was comprised of 14 operatives, including three specialists in crisis negotiation.Â 

There were also two 'breachers,' who had responsibility for preparing the scene for the operation; a K9 specialist, who coordinated all the responding K9 teams; three 'assaulters,' who helped run the show on the ground; two communications specialists; and two snipers, protecting everyone else.

'The team leader quickly won the trust and respect of local police, taking their guidance into account, keeping them informed on next steps, and leading with firmness and unexpected humility,' authors, and Boston Globe reporters, Scott Helman and Jenna Russell write in the book.

Then a helicopter fitted with thermal-imaging moved over the backyard and reported that the suspect appeared to be trying to start a fire in the boat, which was carrying dozens of gallons of fuel and could easily explode.

The FBI team leader calmly told everyone to back away, the authors write.

'I know this is your party,' the leader told Malden SWAT officer Rich Correale. 'But we're going to want you to back up.'

At the leader's request, the FBI breachers launched up to five diversionary devices into the boat in the hope they'd disorient Dzhokhar enough to buy agents and police time to close in on him.

State troopers were also trying to get him out of the boat by tipping it over using an armored military-style vehicle called a BearCat but it only managed to puncture the tarp.

The leader knew there was only one thing to do.

He came over to Correale, the book reveals, and said calmly, with a hand on his shoulder, 'We need to move fast. Get your team. Get a plan together.'

Correale got his SWAT officers together, and with himself at the head, the unit lined up in Henneberry's driveway.

Correale explained the plan: that they'd go at the boat, try to get Dzhokhar to surrender and grab at him if he refused.

The FBI leader went down the line to each member of the SWAT team.

'Flashing a thumbs up, he asked them all: "You good with that?"' the authors write.

'The leader told them that if they didn't like what they saw, they should pull back.'

As they got closer, they saw the suspect, whose face had been on TV all day, in full view, now on the side of the boat.

He looked a mess, Correale said, blood dripping from his head.

'Show me your hands! Show me your hands!' Correale yelled at the suspect.

This was the tensest moment for the SWAT team, as Dzhokhar's right arm and leg were concealed.

They feared the worst but as his hidden limbs came into view, they sighed in relief as they saw he had nothing.

In a flash, the team grabbed him off the boat and threw him to the ground. He was frisked and patted down for explosives and weapons and another cop snapped handcuffs on him before medics worked to keep him alive.

All the cops wanted him to survive, wanted him to stand trial for what he'd done.
