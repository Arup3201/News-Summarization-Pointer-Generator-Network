Olympic medallist Craig MacLean has revealed that his cycling career was blighted for 12 years by undiagnosed digestive disease.

The 42-year-old admitted on Twitter that he suffered exhaustion, anaemia and cramps – without realising he had coeliac disease.

He
 says: ‘Although I was training hard, my body was unable to repair 
itself quickly enough. I am now convinced my illness was affecting my 
track times.’

Long struggle: Craig MacLean, with Chris Hoy and Jason Queally after winning the Track Cycling World Cup in 2005, suffered in silence for more than a decade before discovering he had coeliac disease

In sufferers, the immune system attacks the healthy 
gut in reaction to a protein in bread and other foods. Diarrhoea, 
bloating, stomach pain and tiredness are other symptoms.

Craig says: ‘Sometimes the cramps were so bad it made it impossible to continue training.’

Craig, who won silver at the Sydney 2000 Olympics, was finally diagnosed through a blood test four years ago.

He now follows a strict  gluten-free diet and says he can train far harder and longer.

High risk: Excess weight can lead to several types of cancer, including ovarian, bowel and womb

Obesity raises the risk of ovarian cancer – adding it to a growing list of diseases linked to excess weight.

The increased risk is small but significant, with every five-point rise in body mass index raising the chance by six per cent.

A
 report by the American Institute for Cancer Research and Cancer 
Research Fund looked at 25 studies that focused on the weight of four 
million women, 16,000 of whom developed ovarian cancer.

Past research has shown that being overweight increases the risk of other cancers including breast, bowel and womb.

Rejection
 really does hurt, research suggests, as emotional and social distress 
can manifest itself  in physical pain. Seeing friends suffer can cause 
the same response.

The International School for Advanced Studies in 
Italy used MRI scans to measure participants’ brain activity,  with 
experiments including playing a ball game with one player or their 
friend excluded.

The results showed that social pain activates an area 
of the brain that processes physical pain.
