Mario Balotelli will bounce back from his disappointment with Italy at the 2014 World Cup and can even go on to match Zlatan Ibrahimovic's achievements for AC Milan, according to Christian Abbiati.

Balotelli was part of the Azzurri squad which was knocked out of the World Cup in the group stage and has faced a summer of speculation about his future with Milan reportedly ready to cash in on him.

But Milan goalkeeper Abbiati insists the striker can go on to become as important to the Rossoneri as Ibrahimovic, who scored 42 goals in 61 games and won the Serie A title during a two-year stay with the club.

Serial winner: The Swedish striker has since gone on to win two Ligue 1 titles with Paris Saint-Germain

Wanted man: Balotelli has been linked with a move away from Milan with Arsenal reportedly interested

Abbiati told Gazzetta dello Sport:'He will be back in the squad bursting with enthusiasm after the World Cup. He wants to prove that things are different from how it went in Brazil.

'Can he become Milan's new Ibrahimovic? If he understands that he has to give his best in every training session, then yes.

'I am sure that with new coach Filippo Inzaghi he will succeed.'

Milan finished eighth last season amid a managerial change and talk of dressing room unrest, but Abbiati believes the appointment of Pippo Inzaghi this summer can help the club get back on track.

'Inzaghi has brought a crazy enthusiasm, the team follows him as one. Inzaghi is a concrete example and credible because he is the first one that people respect.'
