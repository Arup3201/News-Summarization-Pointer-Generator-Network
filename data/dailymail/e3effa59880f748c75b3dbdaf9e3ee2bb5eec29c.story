Turkey’s prime minister has warned speculators not to try and make money off the back of the country's troubles, threatening 'we will choke you.'

Tayyip Erdogan also warned protesters who have taken to the streets across Turkey demanding his resignation that his patience has its limits and compared the unrest with an army attempt six years ago to curb his power.

Riot police used teargas and water cannon to disperse anti-government protesters from a square in the capital, Ankara, just a few kilometres from where Erdogan spoke.

Limits: Anti-government protesters stand behind improvised barricade in central Ankara. Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan told flag-waving supporters on Sunday that his patience with mass anti-government protests had its limits

Power struggle: Erdogan moved to seize back the initiative by announcing counter-rallies next weekend

Response: In Ankara's Kizilay district, riot police fired tear gas and water cannon to flush anti-government demonstrators from a square

Threat: Many see Turkey's secular order threatened by Erdogan

He held six rallies on Sunday, a measure
 of tensions after a week of the biggest demonstrations and worst 
rioting of his decade in power.

Thousands waved red Turkish flags and 
shouted Allahu Akbar (God Is Greatest) as he accused protesters of 
attacking women wearing headscarves and desecrating mosques by taking 
beer bottles into them.

'I believe in Erdogan and his path. We will not let some looters hijack our country and our flag,' said a housewife who gave her name as Zeynep, waving a national flag with Erdogan's picture emblazoned on it.

In the commercial centre Istanbul, tens of thousands flooded the central Taksim Square, where protests began nine days ago when police used teargas and water cannon against a peaceful demonstration over plans to build on a park there.

Many see Turkey's secular order threatened by Erdogan.

Protesters, many camped out in tents,
 now control a large area around the square, with approach roads 
barricaded by masonry, paving stones and steel rods. Police have 
withdrawn completely from the area, water cannon kept hundreds of metres
 away by the side of the Bosphorus waterway.

Western
 countries have held up Erdogan's Turkey as an example of an Islamic 
democracy that could be emulated elsewhere in the Middle East.

Violent
 police action, however, has drawn criticism from the West and Erdogan 
has increasingly accused foreign forces of trying to aggravate the 
troubles.

He also 
rounded on speculators, foreign and domestic, in the country's capital 
markets, vowing to 'choke' those who he said were growing rich off 'the 
sweat of the people', and urging Turks to put their money in state not 
private banks.

'Those 
who attempt to sink the bourse, you will collapse ... If we catch your 
speculation, we will choke you. No matter who you are, we will choke 
you,' he said.

Turkey's financial markets were turbulent last week and investors are preparing for more volatility this week.

Early on Friday, the lira hit its 
weakest point against its euro/dollar basket since October 2011, while 
Istanbul's main share index lost around 15 percent over the week.

The yield of Turkey's two-year benchmark sovereign bond hit a six-month high on Thursday.

Three
 people have been killed and around 5,000 injured in the troubles 
rocking a country faced with war across its southern border with Syria.

'We
 were patient, we will be patient, but there is an end to patience, and 
those who play politics by hiding behind the protesters should first 
learn what politics means,' Erdogan said, in one of his most strongly 
worded speeches since the troubles began.

Erdogan
 did not specify who he thought was 'hiding behind the protesters'; but 
one of his proudest achievements has been in combating a conservative 
secularist establishment, especially an army that had toppled four 
governments in four decades.

Erdogan, who critics say has become authoritarian after three election victories in a row, compared the troubles with a confrontation with the army that became known as the 'e-Coup'.

'Today, we are exactly where we were on April 27, 2007.'

On that date, the army issued a memorandum on its website denouncing plans to have Abdullah Gul, co-founder with Erdogan of the AK Party, appointed as president. The move would give AKP broad control over the state apparatus and the generals suggested they could act to stop it in defence of secularism.

Erdogan's government had been expected, like others before it, to bow to the will of the military. But it faced down the army, chided it publicly for its intervention and went ahead with Gul's appointment.

Control: People sleep at Taksim Square - the protestors have now seized control of a large part of the area

It was a definitive moment in relations with the military, many of whose top generals have since been jailed after investigation of alleged coup plots against Erdogan.

The Ergenekon plot had hinged on stirring widespread protests throughout Turkey and public disorder, followed then by bombings and assassinations that would clear the way for an army takeover to restore order.

Erdogan clearly feels there are potentially powerful forces still ranged against him.

Underscoring the drama of the moment, Erdogan, who denies Islamist ambitions for Turkey, made reference to two of his political models - former prime minister Adnan Menderes, hanged after a 1960 coup, and Turgut Ozal, a reforming president who some believe was poisoned to death.

'My beloved brothers, we're walking towards a better Turkey. Don't allow those who attempt to plant divisive seeds to do so,' Erdogan said at another speech in the southern city of Adana on Sunday, from atop of a bus emblazoned with his picture and the AK Party's slogan, 'Big Country, Big Power'.

Meanwhile, a Turkish-American photographer has issued pictures from last week's protests in Istanbul on Facebook.

Charles Emir Richards' pictures are accompanied by the message: 'You don’t need my permission to share the photos.

'I think it is especially important that people outside of Turkey share them to let it be known what is going on here.'

Richards told NBC that Facebook was the only way to get his pictures out

Mr Emir Richards told NBC: 'It has been the only means to get the word out about what is going on here recently.

'The news media here went blank on the issue, that’s when I thought I should go out and shoot and post on Facebook, I felt that a document should get out from somewhere, anywhere.

'Until yesterday [Friday], the local media pretended that nothing was going on. On June 2, when everyone was on the streets engaging the police, CNN Turk was broadcasting a documentary about penguins.'
