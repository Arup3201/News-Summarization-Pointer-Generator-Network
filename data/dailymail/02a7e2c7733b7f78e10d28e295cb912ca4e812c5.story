Louis van Gaal and his Manchester United players were in high spirits during the first training session of their US tour, as the Dutchman laughed and joked with Wayne Rooney while new signings Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera got to know their new team-mates.

The United party travelled to the Stubhub Center on Saturday for their first run-out, with the players getting a chance to acclimatise themselves ahead of Wednesday's friendly against LA Galaxy.

Van Gaal and Rooney appeared to be getting on particularly well, as the England striker was spotted laughing and grinning next to his new boss.
