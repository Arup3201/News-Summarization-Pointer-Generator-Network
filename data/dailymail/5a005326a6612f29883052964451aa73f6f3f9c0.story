A unique project to unveil the workings of the brains of a woolly mammoth is underway in Russia following the discovery of a near perfect specimen.

The 10-year-old animal which scientists have named Yuka was found superbly preserved in the Siberian permafrost in 2009.

Despite being dead for around 39,000 years Yuka's brain was in such good condition that scientists are only recently have researchers disclosed that a full-scale brain mapping exercise is now underway.

Delicate work: A team of scientists carefully remove the brain from the skull

Huge interest: Researchers hope they will be able to significantly boost out knowledge of how the woolly mammoths lived

Vital statistics: A scientist measures the base of Yuka the mammoth's skull

Scientists hope that by quite literally getting inside the beast's head they will be able to significantly boost our understanding of the woolly mammoth.

Remarkable pictures published in the Siberian Times show the moment scientist carefully removed the brain from Yuka's remains so the analysis could begin.

Their initial findings were presented at the 73rd Symposium of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology in Los Angeles.

They claim that the real breakthrough that came when the first CT scan of the cranium was performed at the Republic of Sakha Academy of Sciences, Yakutsk in May 2012.

The team at Yakutsk said: 'It unexpectedly revealed the preserved brain with well-defined major gross anatomy features, including frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes with gyri, and cerebellum with internal structures, which yielded the first chance to examine woolly mammoth brain morphology.

'The brain extraction was performed based on our own experience combined with the generally used treatment for large mammals, including modern elephants.

In tact: Yuka's brain is one of the best-preserved mammoth brains ever discovered as many previous examples have been damaged or shriveled up over the years

Preservation: After removing it from the skull the brain is now stored in formalin solution in Moscow

'In February 2013, the brain was preserved by the method of flowing fixation developed by Professor Sergei Saveliev (Research Institute of Human Morphology, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences (RIHM, RAMS) in Moscow), which included three weeks of continuous preservation of the braincase content only using formalin.'

'After the extraction, the brain was wrapped with fabric for support and placed into formalin solution overnight before being flown to Moscow. It is currently stored in formalin solution at the Research Institute of Human Morphology'.

Early research results confirm the mammoth has a similar brain structure to that of the modern elephant but the team are keen to point out that more research is needed.

Crucially the scientist have been able to identify the main functional areas of the brain and so are able to look forward to a point where they can create a 'brain atlas' for the animal.

On tour: Yuka's body is now doing a tour of the world's top museums where the public has been flocking to see her

Future: Scientists are now hopeful they will be able to create 'brain atlas' for the woolly mammoth

This is to take place in Moscow at the Institute of Human Morphology under the guidance of Professor Saveliev.

A report by Professor Albert Protopopov and colleagues explained the significance of the new project which he says will  help us 'to understand particular aspects of their behaviour'.

It says: 'This discovery holds great scientific significance. This is the first time scientists have got their hands on the brain of an animal that lived tens of thousands of years ago, and one that is in such good condition.'

But while Yuka's brains are being keenly examined by scientists her body is proving to be equally anticipated by tourists who flock to see her as she continues a tour of the world's top museums which this week takes her to Taiwan.Â
