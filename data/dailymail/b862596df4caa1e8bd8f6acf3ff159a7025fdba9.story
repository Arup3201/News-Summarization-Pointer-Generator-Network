Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard insists Ross Barkley has no problem handling expectations as his team-mates are always on hand to bring him back down to earth.

The 21-year-old midfielder enhanced his reputation further with a brilliant opening goal in Monday's 3-1 win over QPR.

He has regularly been likened to Paul Gascoigne and touted as the most gifted footballer of his generation.

Howard believes he has more in common with former Everton prodigy Wayne Rooney, now Barkley's international captain, and Liverpool's Steven Gerrard.

The Toffees goalkeeper is confident the youngster can handle the pressure of such comparisons but admits the Everton dressing room ensures he remains grounded.

'He is special. He has a lot to learn but the thing I love about Ross - which I have not seen in a ton of other players, and I think that is why he gets named with some of the best - is he is fearless,' said the United States international.

'In this country Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard, those guys were 'throwing fire' in their teens and early 20s, and they flourished and that is why Ross is special.

'He wants the big moments, he wants the ball and he doesn't shy away from it - when I was his age I wanted nothing to do with being near the pitch or the spotlight because it was too daunting but he is special in that regard.

'I think Ross can handle it. He enjoys that pressure, he is not afraid of it.

'His football education has been here and it continues to be here and he has guys around him.

'As special as he is, we don't let him drift off with his head in the cloud. We keep him grounded.'

Barkley played in a deeper, orthodox central midfield position against QPR instead of his more familiar attacking role.

He excelled there and both Howard and manager Roberto Martinez are confident it is something he can do again if required, although Barry returns for the trip to Southampton so he may not be needed.

'I think he has to learn the intricacies of playing in the deeper role, it is more disciplined,' added Howard.

'Number 10 is a bit more flair, he has a licence to go forward and his tackling doesn't have to be as precise.

'It was a good learning experience for him and we can use him in that position.'

Martinez has said previously it may turn out to be Barkley's best position but the Spaniard wants the youngster to be adaptable.

'He is someone who can develop into a player who can master a few roles,' said the Toffees boss.

'The most impressive aspect of his goal was how he got into that position - not many players have that power, pace, ball control and ability.

'I think it (a deeper role) suits Ross really well. With certain players the shorter the distance they have to cover to have an influence in the game the better but Ross is the opposite - the more ground he has to cover the more effective he is at times.

'He controlled the game, not just the goal. The way he measured his positioning and tactical awareness was very impressive.

'That deeper role brings a bit more understanding of being aware of what is around you.

'You need to have good experience and a good footballing brain because it tests you and gets you thinking all the time, and it is very important young players have to think while they are on the pitch.

'Ross is clearly benefiting from that and I do see him being able to master those two roles.'
