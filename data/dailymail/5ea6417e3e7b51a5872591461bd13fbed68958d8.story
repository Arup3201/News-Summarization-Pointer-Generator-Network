South Korean war veterans were burning Japanese flags and images of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe today, after a top Japanese politician defended the use of Korean women as sex slaves during World War II.

Former soldiers rallied outside the Japanese Embassy in Seoul, to denounce comments made by Toru Hashimoto, mayor of Osaka, that ‘comfort women’ were necessary to ‘maintain discipline’ in the Japanese Army.

The women, mainly from the Korean peninsula and China, were taken from their homes and made to work in military brothels to ‘comfort’ soldiers with sex.

The protest, which saw a large group 
of former South Korean soldiers gather in front of the embassy, came 
after Mr Abe's December pledge to take back an apology to ‘comfort women’.

Soldiers held up banners with 
anti-Japanese slogans, punched pictures of Mr Hashimoto and burned and 
stamped flags with portraits of Shinzo Abe and the Osaka mayor.

South Korean police stepped in to calm the group of elderly men and several were injured in the scuffle that followed.

Mr Hashimoto’s comments came amid 
mounting criticism at the prospect of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's 
conservative government revising Japan's past apologies for wartime 
atrocities.

Before he took office in December, Mr 
Abe had advocated revising a 1993 statement by then-Prime Minister Yohei
 Kono acknowledging and expressing remorse for the suffering caused to 
the sexual slaves of Japanese troops.

Stomping ground: As the protest escalated, portraits of Shinzo Abe and Toru Hashimoto were thrown on the ground for angry part-takers to tread on to mark their disdain

The remarks hit particularly hard in 
China, which was occupied by Japan during the war, and South Korea, a 
colony under Japan from 1910-1945.

Japan says the matter of compensation 
to the ‘comfort women’ was settled under a 1965 treaty establishing 
diplomatic ties.

In 1995, Japan set up a fund to make payments to the 
women from private contributions, but South Korea says that was not 
official and so not enough.

Earlier today a 91-year-old Japanese 
veteran spoke out against the injustice served to the estimated 200,000 
Asian ‘comfort women’.

Calm before the storm: The protest began with Vietnam War veterans holding banners with anit-Japan messages and shouting slogans outside the embassy

Not sorry: Both Osaka mayor Toru Hashimoto, left, and Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, right, has recently made comments disregarding the pain caused to the 'comfort women' of the Japanese Army

Masayoshi Matsumoto joined the 
Japanese army in 1943 and was sent to occupied China as a medic to help 
examine Korean ‘comfort women’.

‘I feel like a war criminal. It is 
painful to speak of such things and I would rather cover it up. It is 
painful, but I must speak,’ Mr Matsumoto said.

Speaking from his daughter's home 25 
miles from Tokyo, the retired Christian pastor said the ‘comfort 
women’ had no means of escape from the walled town where his military 
unit was stationed.

‘No matter if they wanted to flee, there was no way to escape.’

Recalling the conditions in which the 
women lived, Matsumoto said soldiers lining up for sex would unfasten 
their leg wrappings and lower their trousers so as to waste no time when
 their turns came.

‘It was like they were going to the toilet,’ he said. ‘When I think of it now, it was monstrous, but I didn't think so then.’

The Japanese Government has tried to 
distance itself from Mr Hashimoto’s remarks, saying its position on 
‘comfort women’ is different.

‘The stance of the government on this 
issue is that, as we stated previously, we are deeply pained when 
thinking of the women who experienced immeasurable pain and suffering.

On this point, the Abe cabinet has the
 same position as prior cabinets,’ Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide 
Suga told a news conference last week, although he declined direct 
comment on Hashimoto's remarks.
