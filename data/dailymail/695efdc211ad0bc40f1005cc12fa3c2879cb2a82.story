Bluetooth watches, which pair with your phone to display text messages and control your music, have been tried before with limited success.

But when enthusiastic inventors promised to get it right if they were given enough funding to create their 'Pebble' wristwatch, the Internet erupted with generosity.

The team hoped to raise $100,000 in a month - they achieved this in just hours.

Now, three weeks later, the creators have $10.1million in the bank, and 85,000 buyers waiting to receive their own watch once it rolls off the production lines.

The watch has an E Ink screen and users can pair it with apps on Android and iPhone smartphones

Kickstarter works by allowing investors to put up anything from $1 to thousands of dollars. Some enthusiastic fans pledged $10,000 to turn the smartwatch into reality. Those who donated more than $100 will get a Pebble delivered.

So why is it so special?

'Pebble
is the first watch built for the 21st century,' say its creators. 'It's
infinitely customizable, with beautiful downloadable watchfaces and 
useful internet-connected apps.Â 

'The watch will connect via Bluetooth, and alert users to incoming messages via vibrations - and apps
bring Pebble to life.

'Cyclists can use Pebble as a 
bike computer, accessing the GPS on your smartphone to display speed, 
distance and pace data.

'Runners get a similar set of data displayed on 
their wrist. Use the music control app to play, pause or skip tracks on 
your phone with the touch of a button.'

The watch pairs with apps to record data for sports such as golf, cycling or running

It is this extensibility which 
attracted wannabe-customers to the Pebble - the uses can be limited only
by the ingenuity of programmers.

The creators added: 'If
you're a golfer, feel free to bring Pebble onto the course - we're working with Freecaddie to create a great golf
rangefinder app for Pebble that works on over 25,000 courses 
world-wide.

'Instead of using your phone, view your current distance to 
the green right on your wrist. These apps will be the first, with more 
in the works!'

The
KickStarter website is often used to raise money for hi-tech ventures 
such as videogames, and the sums involved have risen rapidly during 
2012 - but Pebble has set a new record.

Rivals such as Sony - who did try a 
similar range about seven years ago, just before smartphones hit the 
scene - are working on similar products.

LG and others have tried watches with built-in SIM cards before, but the devices have been bulky and expensive.

The project raised $4.3 million in just five days - and then $10million with a week to spare
