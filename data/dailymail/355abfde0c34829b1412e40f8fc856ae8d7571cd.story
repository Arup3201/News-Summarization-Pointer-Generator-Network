Luis Suarez has revealed the boos aimed in his direction from Manchester City fans inspired his double for Barcelona on Tuesday night.

The frontman scored twice as Barcelona earned a 2-1 Champions League last-16 first leg win at the Etihad Stadium.

Suarez, who split opinion among football fans during his two-and-a-half years playing for Liverpool in the Premier League, says the hostile reception he received on his first return to England since his £75million summer move, spurred him on to score.

Speaking to UEFA.com, Suarez said: 'Obviously it is pleasing, first of all to be able to help the team with important goals in a Champions League knockout game [and] of course to come back to England and [win] against a team you're always motivated to play against.

'There are certain types of players like me who get more inspired, more motivated when fans boo them - it helps motivate you a bit more.' 

Part of Barcelona's fearsome trio alongside Lionel Messi and Neymar, Suarez opened the scoring on 16 minutes as he fired a left-footed shot past goalkeeper Joe Hart after the ball had landed kindly for him in the box.

The Uruguay international then doubled the lead for Luis Enrique's side on the half-hour mark, sliding in to convert Jordi Alba's left-wing cross before Sergio Aguero replied in the second half for the hosts with 20 minutes to go.
