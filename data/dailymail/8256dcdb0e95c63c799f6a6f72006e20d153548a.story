Children born within the next generation will live for 100 years on average, according to newly released statistics.

As life expectancy across Britain increases, current projections place female babies born as soon as 2057 to  reach 100 years old - a remarkable milestone once previously thought impossible.

The study, published today by the Office for National Statistics, reveals that the average life expectancy has increased in the past 35 years by about seven years.

If these increases continue, a boy born in the UK in 2057 has an average life expectancy of 97.3 years, while the figure for girls born in the same year will be 100.

The projections were revealed in a newly report that analysed the size and characteristics of Britain's population.

Such data provides valuable insight for the future, enabling lawmakers to better plan services such as transport infrastructure and healthcare.

High levels of migration and an increase in the number of births have also contributed to Britain's swelling population, the researchers found.

In its analysis, researchers stated: 'With life expectancy increasing, the UK’s population will age.

'This will affect a number of policy areas, including pensions and the health service – particularly because healthy life expectancy is not increasing as quickly.'
