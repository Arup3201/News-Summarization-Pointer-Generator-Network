The cost to Arizona taxpayers for Jodi Arias' defense now tops $2.7 million, and the figure will keep rising as her penalty phase retrial continues in a Phoenix courtroom.

Maricopa County spokeswoman Cari Gerchick released Thursday the amount billed so far by Arias' two court-appointed attorneys after the former waitress was unable to pay for her own defense. 

The figure is up more than $200,000 from the one released in late September.

On trial this week: The cost to Arizona taxpayers for Jodi Arias' defense now tops $2.7 million, and the figure will keep rising as her penalty phase retrial continues in a Phoenix courtroom

Prosecutors have declined to provide their costs to try the case.  

Arias was convicted last year for brutally murdering her ex-boyfrined, Travis Alexander, in 2008 but jurors deadlocked on her punishment. 

During the murder, Alexander suffered nearly 30 knife wounds to his body, was shot in the head and had his throat slit so deeply he was almost decapitated. 

Arias initially denied any involvement - even calling Alexander in the days after the killing and leaving friendly messages on his voicemail.

But two years after her arrest, she eventually admitted to killing him - but said it was in self-defense. She said she recalled Alexander attacking her in fury for dropping his camera after a day of sex at his home. 

A new jury is now deciding her whether to sentence her to life in prison or death for the killing of Alexander.

 An appeals court decision last week overturned a ruling that closed the courtroom as Arias' first witness testified. Her lawyers previously said the witness would testify only in a closed courtroom.

Some of the testimony in question was conducted in private. 

The Arizona Republic and three Phoenix TV stations - KPNX, KPHO and KTVK - protested the closure and ultimately succeeded in getting the ruling by Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Sherry Stephens thrown out.

The Arizona Court of Appeals suggested in its ruling last week that the previously unidentified witness might have been Arias herself, though it remains unclear.

The news organizations are now urging Stephens to release a transcript of the Oct. 30 testimony.

The Arias case has been marked by secrecy since the conclusion of the first trial, where salacious and violent details about Arias and Alexander were broadcast live around the world.

Since then, the judge has held one secret hearing after another and barred the broadcast of footage from the sentencing retrial until after a verdict is reached.

Arias' lawyers had argued that daily broadcasts of the trial would lead to defense witnesses backing out for fear of being harassed or threatened.
