Busted: Brian Lanza had been cited in the melee, and turned himself in to police on Monday

A second man faces felony charges in a brawl between two wedding parties that was caught on video at a downtown Philadelphia hotel.

Prosecutors said Westfield, New Jersey, resident Brian Lanza, 29, was charged Tuesday with aggravated assault, criminal conspiracy and other counts in the October 7 fight at a hotel in the city's Society Hill section.

Lanza was one of the wedding guests who had been cited for allegedly attacking one of the police officers who responded to the scene.

He was charged with aggravated assault, resisting arrest and criminal conspiracy, according to the Philadelphia Inquirier.

The altercation involved dozens of people in ball gowns and tuxedos and was caught on tape by a teenage hotel guest as dozens of police struggled to break up the fracas.

Authorities said a 57-year-old man suffered a fatal heart attack.

Investigators have been reviewing the video and Lanza is the second person facing felony charges.

A message at a telephone listing for him said the number was not accepting calls.

Last week, brother-of-the-groom Matthew Sofka denied assaulting a police officer and said he intends to fight all charges against him.

Sofka, 26, was taken into custody after the violent melee broke out at the Sheraton Society Hill hotel.

The dust-up - involving 50 to 100 people
- was caught on video by another guest and posted on YouTube. It has 
since been watched more than 1,000,000 times.

Sofka's attorney said his client neither assaulted police or resisted arrest. In fact, he said he was repeatedly struck by officer's batons and subdued with a stun gun.

The wedding of his brother Michael Sofka to Nicole Sanutti had taken place in another venue nearby but some of the guests returned to the Sheraton later where they were staying.

There, they ran into trouble with the other wedding party.

Attorney Fortunato Perri Jr said the fight was already underway when Sofka arrived at the hotel and that he did not assault the officers.

'He has the highest respect for law enforcement. His father is a retired police officer.

'There was absolute chaos going on from a prior incident,' he told Philly.com last Tuesday, adding that there was still no idea as to how it started.

The wedding of Michael Sofka and Nicole Sannuti ended in tragedy after a drunken brawl between two wedding parties claimed the lif of her uncle and left the groom's brother in jail

The bride's uncle Vincent Sanutti, 57, suffered a heart attack in the hotel parking lot and was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital. 

Mr Perri said: 'This was supposed to be a joyous and 
happy affair, but it turned into tragedy. It was bedlam 
when they walked in there.'

Hotel guest Max Schultz, 15, videotaped the 2am altercation. He was not a part of either wedding party.

Police said Sofka, Lanza and another man, who was not identified, punched and kicked Officer Sean Dandridge, striking him in the head.

Yesterday, a picture was released of the bride and groom before their wedding day with details of what Nicole Sanutti expected her big day to be like - none of which included a brawl.

The 28-year-old planned everything on social-media website Pinterest and it shows she was planning a fairytale day, rather than the nightmare it turned out to be.

On her page, she pinned links to the perfect cake, sparkly centerpieces, hairstyles and shadow boxes to hold her wedding memorabilia.

One pin suggested a heart-felt message
written on the sole of a bride's shoe from a groom.

Another showed 
unique floral arrangements and even a tree on which guests leave their 
fingerprints.

She was also taken with a service where you can stitch the date of the wedding in the hem of the dress.

Nicole will never be able to forget the date of her big day, but for very different reasons than she hoped.

In the video, women can be heard screaming as men shove each other around near the wedding party table. 

Suddenly, Philadelphia police can be seen charging into the reception with nightsticks and 
pulling fighting wedding guests off each other.

Hotel guests
said up to 100 cops showed up to control the 50 to 100 wedding guests 
who were fighting.

At least five officers can be seen yanking the combatants away from each other.

Police and hotel guests said the fights appeared to be fueled by alcohol.

'Did they just deck the bride?' the man behind the camera asks at one point.

Lt Ray Evers, police spokesman, said it's still not clear what sparked the fights.

'I don't have a solid answer how it started,' he said, 'but we had to come in and clean it up.'

More arrests are expected as police 
interview more guests and responding police officers, and as they pore 
over additional surveillance footage.

Contrary to the poster's assertion, the video does not appear to show that one of the brides was punched.

A woman in a wedding dress can be seen standing outside the fray.
