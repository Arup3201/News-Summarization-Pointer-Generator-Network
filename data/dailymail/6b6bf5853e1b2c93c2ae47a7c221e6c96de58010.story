When Sally Stone had a suspected stroke due her to huge weight, she knew that she had to take drastic action.

She immediately joined a slimming club and made serious changes to her lifestyle, but as she began to lose weight and get fitter a new motivation for dropping the pounds came along: a sexy date with a 'boudoir' photographer.

Sally's friend had encouraged her to take part in a boudoir shoot, and Sally knew that the only way she would dare to bare in her underwear was to carry on losing weight.

It spurred her on to lose 7st 9lb, going from 18 stone 7 to a much slimmer 10 stone 10, and drop six dress sizes in the process.

Sally Stone celebrated an eight stone weight loss by posing in lingerie in a 'boudoir' shoot

Sally, 40, who is single and lives in Crediton, Devon, with her son Luke, eight, said: 'The thought of baring my body in a photoshoot was enough to keep me losing the pounds towards the end of my weight loss.

'A friend had encouraged me to have the photoshoot done. I would never have dreamed of doing anything like that before.

'But losing the weight really boosted my confidence and it definitely helped me carrying on losing the pounds.'

Sally started piling on the weight when she was in her 30's, and she'd struggled with her weight on and off during her teenage years.

'When I was very little, I was a podgy child,' she said. 'Then I slimmed down a bit, but put weight back on in my early teens. By my late teens I'd slimmed down to a size 12, and when I was 25 I was actually a size 10. But then I put on some weight in my 30's. 

The mother-of-one, who was a size 22 at her largest, was shocked into changing her lifestyle after suffering  a suspected stroke

 'By the time I married my husband in 2005 I was a size 16, and then a year later, when I gave birth to our son Luke in 2006 my weight had crept up to about 17 stone.

'In the following few years I wasn't happy with my size, but I would comfort eat, and the weight piled on even more.' 

Sally wouldn't eat any breakfast, then she would tuck into pasties for a mid morning snack. She would have sandwiches and crisps for lunch, and then often she would have a takeaway for dinner.

'I work as a carpenter making children's play equipment, and my colleague would nip out mid morning and get pasties for us to snack on, and that was before I would eat any lunch.

'I would snack on chocolate during the day, especially my favourite Yorkie bars. When I ate chocolate bars at night, I couldn't eat just a few pieces, I would wolf down the whole bar. And I would have takeaways several times during the week and at weekends too. I especially loved Chinese and kebabs too.'

Carpenter Sally started losing weight when she swapped takeaways for salads and homemade dinners, but it was booking the sexy shoot that gave her the final motivation she needed to slim down 

But Sally's weight proved to be a problem when she was working on a child's play cottage in a garden near Devon.

She said: 'I was working with my colleague Alex in the garden. I was inside the children's play cottage hammering in some nails, and he was outside. Suddenly I had tunnel vision and everything went dark. I had a splitting pain in the the side of my face above my eye and I felt really sick.

'It was terrifying, I had no idea what was happening to me and I couldn't get my words out properly either. I wanted to shout out to Alex to come and help me, but I couldn't even remember his name. Luckily he heard me banging about in the cottage and came to see what was wrong. 

'He helped me outside and got me to sit down, but I still felt really unwell.'

When Sally started to feel better, she went down to the hospital where she was tested in the stroke unit as doctors thought she may have suffered a minor stroke.

Today, weighing 10 st 10 lb, Sally says doing the shoot was the best thing to happen to her

She said: 'I was eventually given the all clear and I hadn't actually had a stroke. But it gave me such a fright. The doctors told me that my weight had probably caused it, so it was really worrying. It had been such a terrifying experience that I knew that I had to something about it.

'I felt that it was my fault, that I'd felt so unwell and it was only me who could do something about it.'

So in January 2013, Sally, who is now single, joined her local Slimming World class. She swapped takeaways and chocolate bars for healthy breakfasts, salad lunches and homemade spaghetti bolognaise or cottage pie for dinner.

'It was a great diet as I could eat as much as I liked, but it was healthy food and not all the sugar and salt in takeaways.'

The weight started to fall off Sally, and when she had lost several stone, she was chatting with a friend, who made a suggestion.

'My friend's daughter had just done a modelling photoshoot,' she said. 'And my friend said I should do one too, to celebrate having lost all the weight. She encourage me to do a shoot in my lingerie to really boost my confidence.

'I'd never even imagined doing such a photoshoot before, and it was something that was completely out of my comfort zone. But I gave it some thought and decided that it would give me something to work towards.

'So I booked the shoot, and carried on losing the weight and managed to hit my target weight of ten stone ten in March. The photoshoot was booked for June.

'I was nervous when I arrived at the Kensa Boudoir Photography studio but the photographer really put me at ease, and so did the make-up artist.

'When I was overweight I didn't even like dressing up to go out, so the thought of stripping down to my underwear and being photographed was something I would have never thought I would ever contemplate.

'But there I was stretched out in all my lingerie, and as the shoot went on, I felt more relaxed and less nervous. I was proud of my body after losing all the weight, but I still had loose skin and stretch marks too. But I was thrilled with the photos afterwards. I just looked at them and didn't even believe it was me at first! I never imagined I could ever look like that.

'When I showed the photos to family and friends they were amazed too. I've lost a total of 7 stone 9, going from 18 stone 7 to 10 stone 10. And I've dropped from a size 22 to a 10/12. 

I still can't believe it when I catch sight of my reflection in shop windows as I walk past - I have to do a double take as I don't realise its me.

'I feel much healthier too, and I haven't had another funny turn like I had that time in the garden. I've got much more energy for my job and playing with Luke too. If anyone had told me I would lose nearly eight stone and pose for a sexy photoshoot I wouldn't have believed them. But it's been the best thing to have happened to me.'
