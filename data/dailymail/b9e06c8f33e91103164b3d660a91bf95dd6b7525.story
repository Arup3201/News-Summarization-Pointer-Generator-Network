The FBI are closing in on American ISIS executioner after a wave of 'substantial leads' following a public appeal for help in identifying him.

The unknown man, who has appeared in a propaganda video released by the terror group, is believed to be from the United States because of his pronounced American accent. 

Today a senior FBI official told ABC News that new leads possibly included a man with a 'North American' accent who appeared in the clip.

The FBI are closing in on American ISIS executioner after a wave of 'substantial leads' following a public appeal for help in identifying him

'The FBI tips website that was announced yesterday has received a substantial number of web visits, some of which have generated leads,' another FBI official said earlier today, reports ABC News.

'We continue to call on the public to report suspicious activity of travelers in support of a terrorist organization or information about the subject speaking with a North American accent in the video issued by ISIL on September 19.

The Bureau hopes that somebody watching the video may recognize the terrorist.

Agents uploaded their own cut of the video, which skips the graphic and violent portions of the 55-minute original, entitled The Flames of War.

But it does show the American figure, wearing a black mask and combat fatigues, boasting over captives whom he says are being forced to dig their own graves. ISIS's black flag billows in the background.

The scene then cuts to a different scene, where a row of prisoners kneel as the American-voiced figure boasts of the Islamic State's treatment of 'kuffar' - a derogatory term for non-Muslims. 

Help: The FBI has reportedly received hundred of tips about the 'North American' militant, but none have produced immediate arrests

Graves: In the video, the jihadist claims that the Syrian soldiers behind him digging their graves were 'terrorizing' Muslims and were going to face death

The video fades away as the figure turns, gun in hand, towards the waiting men. 

A statement from the FBI said: 'In releasing a segment from the video, the FBI hopes someone might recognize the man through his voice and appearance.

'In the segment, the faces of purported prisoners are obscured and their executions are not shown.

Michael Steinbach, of the FBI’s Counterterrorism Division, said: 'We’re hoping that someone might recognize this individual and provide us with key pieces of information. No piece of information is too small.'

Discussing the videos, the director of the Bureau, James Comey, said they appeal to 'troubled souls' and give them the push they need to 'emerge from the basement' as full-fledged jihadists. 

He said: 'These homegrown violent extremists are troubled souls who are seeking meaning in some misguided way. 

ISIS: In the video, the jihadist pointed to a building, which he claims, was repeatedly fired at by Islamic State militants

Just begun: At the end of the video the jihadist declares that 'the fighting has just begun'

'And so they come across the propaganda and they become radicalized on their own independent study, and they're also able to equip themselves with training again on the Internet, and then engage in jihad after emerging from their basement.'

The FBI is also urging people to report anybody they know who has traveled - or might want to travel - to Iraq and Syria to fight.

Steinbach said the agency 'need' help from the American public to identify any would-be jihadists - and have set up a phone line and web page for any tip-offs. 

The U.S. government has estimated that more than 100 Americans have left the country to fight with ISIS, some of whom have now come back.

Intelligence officials are said to have confirmed the identities of a dozen Americans on the ground on the side of ISIS.

On Saturday the FBI arrested Mohammed Hamzah Khan at O'Hare airport, Chicago, as he tried to fly to Turkey.

Dozen: James Comey, FBI director, said that about a dozen Americans are believed to be fighting alongside ISIS

The 19-year-old, from nearby Bolingbrook, Illinois, is accused of attempting to travel overseas to support terrorism - which carries a maximum sentence of 15-years.

Khan is also charged with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization.

He reportedly told FBI agents how he hoped to join ISIS - and investigators who scoured his home found documents outlining his intentions, including a letter asking his parents to join him. 

Other Americans have made similar attempts. Twenty-year-old Adam 'Fadi Fadi' Dandach was arrested by FBI in Los Angeles in July, and confessed he was headed to Syria to join up with ISIS.

The next month investigators took in Donald Ray Morgan, 44, of North Carolina over firearms violations, NBC reports.

But the agency then discovered pro-ISIS messages on his social media accounts, including an image of him swearing fealty to ISIS's ruler, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

A Colorado woman, Shannon Maureen Conley, has pleaded guilty in court to charges that she tried to fly to Turkey to become involved with ISIS.

One man who made it was Douglas McAuthur McCain, 33, of Minnesota.

According to the New York Times, he was fighting on the front lines in August when he was killed by a rival Syrian group.

FBI sources told the paper that American jihadists tend to be younger than those from elsewhere, often in their teens or early twenties. 

Americans? Around 100 U.S. citizens are thought to have left the country for Syria - and some have returned

James Comey, FBI director, said that about a dozen Americans are believed to be fighting alongside ISIS, according to AP. 

But Comey reportedly told CBS' 60 Minutes that he is even more worried about the Americans that aren't currently on his radar. 

'I don't know what I don't know,' Comey said.

The FBI reports that U.S. citizens traveling overseas to fight alongside terrorist groups is nothing new.

In the FBI's website post, it cited many instances of U.S. citizens attempting to do so including citizens from Chicago and New York who were arrested  for attempts made as many as four years ago.
