For the discerning hipster looking to travel about town and not worry about parking their fixed gear bicycle, a Hungarian designer may have the answer.

The Scooter belt works as a full sized scooter - but also doubles as a belt.

When you arrive at your destination, a simple velcro tab loosens the scooter's body, allowing it to 'collapse' and be wrapped around a waist.

 Adam Horok, a designed from Hungary, is behind the project.

'The most efficient vehicles that bridge these two points in the shortest time are those powered by leg power, whose need for specific pathways is a must in every developing city. 

'There is one thing even more important, and that is storage. 

'A vast range of methods has been developed in recent in years but these will all become obsolete if the vehicle is developed that is entirely portable, even wearable as part of our clothing. '

'Our physical need to move around gains an entirely new meaning in the future, depending on the price we are willing to pay for it, in terms of the fast approaching ecological changes.  

Releasing the velcro tab instantly causes the scooter to collapse, allowing it to be worn around the waist.

It features two wheel and a solid wood base curved so it can wrap around the body when used as a belt.

'Compared to public transport, the car offers its advantage in independence, and personal space alongside the sense of a safe space with the ability to choose the take-off and destination points,' he said.

'The main problem of the electric versions currently being under development are that the awkwardness of the energy supply puts a powerful limitation on efficiency and distance. 

'We can bypass the problem by turning the equation around, making it's seeming disadvantage into our advantage.
