These 170-year-old images reveal what life was like in the world’s most famous canal city before it was mobbed by hordes of gondola-riding tourists.

Some of the earliest photos of Venice – snapped in the 1840s and 1850s – show an empty piazza in front of St Mark’s Basilica, the Ca’ d’Oro palace under restoration, and a Grand Canal with very little boat traffic.

The tranquil scenes are a far cry from modern-day Venice, which is visited by an estimated 10 million tourists a year.

The black and white photos, discovered in a UK country auction in 2006, have been confirmed as daguerreotypes – images developed on a polished metal plate – that belonged to influential Victorian art critic and writer John Ruskin.

The ‘lost photographs’ were taken mostly by Ruskin, who died in 1900 at the age of 80, while he was working on his three-volume treatise on Venetian art and architecture.

They include the largest collection of daguerreotypes of Venice and possibly the earliest surviving photos of the French and Swiss Alps.

The photos have been preserved and identified by collectors and historians Ken and Jenny Jacobson, who have co-authored a book that documents Ruskin’s photography.

Based on their suspicion that the images belonged to Ruskin, the Essex couple acquired the lot at an auction in Cumbria, where Ruskin lived.

A bidding war with another collector raised the price to £75,000 from an original estimate of just £80.

Ken Jacobson, who has been collecting historic photos with his wife for almost 45 years, said: ‘The discovery of 188 previously unknown John Ruskin daguerreotypes has been the most exciting of our career.

Ducal Palace was a popular photography spot; this image shows a south-facing window looking out towards a lagoon (circa 1849-1852)

‘The propitious circumstances of this find were truly magnified many times over by the fascinating discoveries we made during our research and the generosity, intelligence and friendship we shared with other scholars and our conservators.

‘We feel that the quality and unorthodox style of many of Ruskin’s daguerreotypes will come as a major surprise to both photographic historians and those in the field of Ruskin scholarship.

‘It is an astonishing accomplishment for a polymath better known for his achievements in so many other disciplines. Ruskin’s daguerreotypes would be a sensational new revelation in the history of photography even if he were completely unknown. We hope the work will be as intriguing to others as it has been to us.’

Published by Bernard Quaritch, the 432-page book, Carrying Off the Palaces: John Ruskin’s Lost Daguerreotypes, contains a fully illustrated catalogue raisonne of the 325 known daguerreotypes, plus details about the Jacobsons’ research.
