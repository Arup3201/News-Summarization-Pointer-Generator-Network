Vintage fashion has long been all the rage in Europe and America, and now one Namibian fashionista is championing the retrospective style in Africa.

Lourens Loux Gebhardt, who writes the blog Loux The Vintage Guru, says many vintage fashion vendors in Africa don't realise the value of what they are selling.

'Many people aren't interested in wearing
 vintage, they just see it as used clothing... I manage to dress 
myself cheaply and end up looking like a million bucks,' says the designer, tailor and stylist.

Loux is a designer, stylist, and tailor, and is consumed by his enthusiasm for vintage fashion

While he says money can be an 
issue when trying to find success in fashion, he has perfected the art 
of buying inexpensive clothing at thrift stores - and always looking supremely dapper.

Loux says he is a self-proclaimed hipster - someone he describes as having the freedom of creative expression and influence on fashion sense.

Loux
 revamps vintage threads - often discarded as old and unusable by their 
owners - and is pictured on his blogs sporting fashion-forward outfits comprising 
smart slim-fit suits, bright socks and printed shirts, alongside other models.

As
 a young boy he was inspired by his grandfather, who once told him: 'My 
son, fashion is what you adopt when you don't yet know who you are, make
 sure you are always well-dressed.'

Loux
 has kept those words of advice with him and now takes vintage clothes 
from his father's generation and adds his modern touch, he told MessyNessyChic.com.

He says 'a lot of vintage vendors [here] don't really realise the value of what they're selling'

He is now collaborating with Khumbala, a group of stylists and designers from 
Johannesburg, to launch a street-style website that 
seeks to inspire Africans to step out in style and introduce them to the merits of vintage fashion.

They want to 'show the fashion world that we can
 unite as one in the African continent'.

When we collaborate 
we call ourselves LIA (Love is African), and we're currently playing a big 
part by simply inspiring fashionistas around the African continent,' report My Modern Met.

If he continues making waves with the art of thrift shopping and styling
 as he is, he may be on the verge of sparking a fashion revolution in 
Africa.
