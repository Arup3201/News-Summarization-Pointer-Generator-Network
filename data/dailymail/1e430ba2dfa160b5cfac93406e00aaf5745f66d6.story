One Direction's Zayn Malik has said he is 'angry and upset' after Today host Matt Lauer questioned bandmates about alleged drug use in his absence.

The presenter was booed by fans after asking the remaining four members why the 21-year-old wasn't there, suggesting it was not down to illness and questioned whether it was actually because of rumored substance abuse.

Speaking to Dan Wootton at British newspaper The Sun, Malik confirmed that he was too ill to fly to America over the weekend as the band begin promoting their new album Four.

A special appearance on the Today show to promote their new album was spoiled by 1D appearing a man down due to Zayn Malik, 21, suffering apparently from a 'tummy bug'

Matt Lauer risked the wrath of an audience full of devoted One Direction fans on Monday when he quizzed the boy band about drugs

He said: 'I'm really angry and upset by what was said on The Today Show. I was really ill at the weekend. That's why I couldn't fly to America.' 

During the interview at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida, Lauer said: 'I'm counting chairs here and I see four. Normally we're used to seeing you guys with five, so let's start with the obvious: where is Zayn?’

'He’s got a tummy bug so he’s not very well,’ explained Liam Payne. ‘We only found out this morning so we’re really sad, he is as well, that he can’t be here for our album release.'

Lauer then decided to press the boys for more information, citing online speculation that drugs might be the real reason for Malik’s no show.

'There has been a lot of action on social media about him,’ said Lauer. ‘Is it something more serious than just a minor illness? There have been rumors of substance abuse: what's going on?'

The host’s question drew loud boos from the crowd made up of predominantly of teenage girls who had been waiting hours for the band's appearance

'No, he's just got a stomach bug, he's OK. He's just at home, he needs to rest,' said Payne, while he band-mates shifted nervously in their seats.

This isn't Malik's first absence from 1D duties, earlier this month he wasn't present for the filming of a video to receive an MTV Europe award. 

In May, MailOnline ran exclusive video footage of Malik and bandmate Louis Tomlinson caught laughing and joking about marijuana as they shared a roll-up 'joint' during the Latin America leg of their 2014 Stadium Tour.  

A representative for 1D told MailOnline: 'Zayn was taken ill after recording the Band Aid single at the weekend and was unfortunately not well enough to fly to the USA yesterday.

An estimated 15,000 fans clamored to get a glimpse of the young heart-throbs on Monday and a large number voiced their disapproval when Matt Lauer quizzed Zayn's band-mates about his absense

'He will join the band for promotion for the new album as soon as he possibly can.'

Payne was joined on Today by bandmates Harry Styles, Tomlinson, and Niall Horan for the launch of the band's now somewhat ironically titled new album Four.

The singers arrived on stage by a boat, as a reported 15,000 fans clamored to get a glimpse of the young heart-throbs on the Universal CityWalk.

Fans showed their concern about Zayn's absence with the hashtag #GetWellSoonZayn, which quickly becoming a worldwide trending topic on Twitter.

'No Zayn is like the world without pizza it's incomplete,' tweeted Selah Potter.

The remaining four will continue with their U.S. promotional duties without Zayn for the foreseeable future until he is well enough to join them.

The group's fourth album was released on Monday and looks set to do well in the charts, following the success of the record's lead single Steal My Girl, which went straight to number one in the US, and number three in the UK.
