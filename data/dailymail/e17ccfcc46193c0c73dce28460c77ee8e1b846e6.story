Health chiefs are planning to close a Burger King that is located inside a hospital after years of complaints the fast-food restaurant does not live up to health standards. 

The branch in Southampton General Hospital will be closed next year after attracting criticism from politicians and health organisations. 

Hospital chiefs say it is no longer in keeping with the 'healthcare environment' bosses wish to portray, and will not renew the fast food restaurant's lease when it expires in 2016.

A hospital in Southampton has decided to close the Burger King restaurant in its lobby following complaints from healthcare organisations and politicians that it did not live up to health standards

The fast food giant has had an outlet in the hospital for almost 20 years.  

'The trust is currently in the process of redeveloping its main entrance retail area,' a spokesman for Southampton General Hospital said.

'This is to ensure it is more reflective of the healthcare environment in which it is situated.

'The Burger King franchise currently occupies a retail space that is leased until 2016, but there are no plans to extend the contract beyond that point,' a spokesman for the hospital said. 

Dr Hilary Jones supported the decision, saying: 'Let’s tackle obesity and let’s start by ensuring hospitals are healthy places.

The hospital will not extend Burger King's long-held lease in the facility when it is up for renewal in 2016

'You would not get a doctor telling patients to stop off for a burger and a can of Coke. 

'If you are being told to eat healthy and exercise by overweight doctors and nurses it is hypocrisy so we should be setting a better example.'

MP Rob Flello, chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on obesity, said: 'I think fast food outlets like Burger King have their place, but being in a hospital is not an appropriate.

'This is welcome news and I hope other hospitals take the time to review the outlets that they have.' 

Burger King have declined to comment. 

Earlier this year it emerged that a hospital in Dundee was selling an 800-calorie, 'heart attack' pie in its canteen.  

Critics described the delicacy as 'a heart attack on a plate'. 

Ninewells Hospital admitted selling the pies at one of its takeaway restaurants, but insisted there were also healthy options on the menu.
