Photographed using a specialized microscope whose viewing stage is chilled to -170C, scientists in Maryland are showing a whole new side to what's caught on the tip of our tongues.

Using a low-temperature scanning electron microscope, researchers at the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center have captured an astonishing new view on naturally-occurring snowflakes.

Shipping in the samples collected from snow banks or during fresh snow fall from around the country, the researchers study their composition for their effects on our ecosystem.

Full-frontal: These unique images captured with a low-temperature scanning electronic microscope capture show a side to snowflakes rarely seen before

Colouring: This image, shown with a tint of red, is what is called a psedo-coloured snowflake whose colour is computer generated and used commonly to highlight different parts of the flake

Frosty touch: Magnifying this hexagon flake 450 times its size shows a detailed, frosty surface

Use: The magnifications, while stunning, are used to help scientists better assess the nation's water supply and how to protect from flooding

E.T.: With such unique detail some flakes appear extraterrestrial-like

In comparison to man made or artificial snow - they also show in samples magnified on their website – the naturally occurring snow is dramatically more rigid and varied in structure, with the man made appearing more round and gob-like.

More importantly to the scientists than how they look, cosmetically at least, is the data gained from where they were collected that's of value.

'Information gained from studying the structure of snow is vital to several areas of science as well as to activities that affect our daily lives...' the website of the Electron and Confocal Microscopy Laboratory states.

The hydrologists explain the flakes' use to determine the winter snow pack's water content to better determine the nation's water supply and how to better protect from flooding.

Artificial: A closeup on some artificial snow shows a much smoother contrast from the naturally made snow

Shipped: The snowflakes are shipped to the center in Maryland from natural sources outside the state

Collecting: The snowflakes are either brushed onto copper flakes held by researchers or allowed to fall naturally on them

Preservation: Once the flakes are captured they are right away dipped in liquid nitrogen, cooling them down to -196C

Stuck: The copper plates used to catch the flakes are also coated on one side with methyl cellulose - a gel like solution

Shipping: Once captured on the copper plate, they can be shipped in a previously liquid nitrogen-cooled dewar

Using flat copper plates precooled to the same outside temperature and coated on one side with methyl cellulose - a gel like solution - researchers from outside the state collect the snow samples on this pallet before sending it out.

The field researchers report either allowing the snowflakes to fall and settle on the plate's surface or lightly brushing them on themselves.

Once collected, the plates are rapidly plunged in liquid nitrogen, cooling them down to -196C.

The plates can then be shipped in a previously liquid nitrogen-cooled dewar, providing them with thermal insulation before transported by air or ground.

Resemblances: Like a prickly sundial, one flake reveals a hexagon plate with a frosty siding

Extra details: A glass-like snowflake in the upper right-hand corner shows the center flake before pulling in to a view 79 times its size

Depth: Zooming into each flake reveals more and more spiny edges and crevices that appear to go on forever

Magnifications: Shown at the top, a flake is seen magnified 908 times while at the bottom the same area is seen magnified 1,860 times

Variety: Appearing as though brushed with icing, some snowflakes appear more rounded than the others typically seen as thorny

Guessing game: Depending on your interests, a close up on this snowflake could resemble a simple barbell or a TIE fighter from Star Wars

Surfaces: Another snowflake, tinged in blue with the help of a computer, shows smoother, stacked surfaces

Structures: Another snowflake shows what the researchers call columns and plates
