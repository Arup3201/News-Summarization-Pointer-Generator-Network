Lord Rogers has broken his silence over the death of his son and its effect on his wife Ruth.

The architect said that although he can bear the loss, his celebrity chef wife is 'up and down' and often experiences a 'tsunami' of grief.

The architect, whose wife is the celebrated chef and cookery writer Ruth Rogers, said 'somehow' he could bear the loss but had come to the conclusion that women coped less well with sorrow than men.

'I can bear it somehow — I have no idea how. Ruthie can't. It's a terrible thing' said Lord Rogers.

'I've come to the conclusion that women are different.'

Bo Rogers died after suffering a seizure in a friend's bath last year.

He had escaped from Vernazza in northern Italy when the town was hit by flooding and landslides.

The 27-year-old was not epileptic, and it was thought that the shock and stress of the flood might have triggered his fit.

Lord Rogers' designs include the Millennium Dome, the Lloyd's Building and Terminal Five at Heathrow Airport.

The 79-year old was speaking at the launch of a campaign to repair the damage caused by the floods in Vernazza.

He told the Sunday Times that his son - who spoke fluent Italian - loved the town.

'Bo was rather good at languages and spoke fluent Italian.'

'We adopted this place and it in turn adopted us, especially Bo. He just belonged. It was a family joke that one day he'd be mayor.'

He hopes that the family will come to love the town again, but admitted it might prove a challenge for his wife.

'Ruthie is up and down. She's OK, then it hits her and it's like an explosion. She describes it as a 'tsunami' of grief.'

Ruth Rogers opened the famous River 
Cafe in Hammersmith in 1987. Her son's death came less than two years 
after the death from cancer of her close friend 
Rose Gray.

River Café is considered one of the country's leading Italian restaurants, producing celebrity chefs Jamie Oliver, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Tobie Puttock.
