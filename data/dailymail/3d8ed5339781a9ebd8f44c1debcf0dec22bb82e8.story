A British pilot has died after his light aircraft crashed into a mountain in thick fog, Italian police have confirmed.

Flying club director Alan Tyson, 51, was killed instantly after his five seater Beechcraft 58 Baron twin turbo prop plane flew into Mt Mindino near the Italian Riviera at an altitude of 1,880 metres.

Last night police and air accident officials were investigating the accident and looking at the possibility that the airplane's altimeter was faulty.

Horror: The site of the plane crash on Mt Mindinio near the Italian Riviera where British pilot Alan Tyson, 51, died

Police said the alarm was raised by air traffic controllers at Albenga airport on the Italian Riviera near Savona after it disappeared from radar screens shortly after taking off on Sunday morning and at the same time by a walker who heard the low flying plane and seconds later the sound of a crash.

At the time of the accident visibility was said to be poor with the mountains in the area covered in fog and Mr Tyson is thought to have delayed his departure because of the poor weather and had then tried to make the flight after a 'clear window' was forecast.

However the plane crashed into the slopes of the mountain near Garessio, 30 miles north of Albenga and walkers further down the mountain reported hearing a loud explosion.

Fire fighters and alpine rescue teams were quickly on the scene and the wreckage was found close to a cross that marks the summit of the mountain and which is a popular destination with walkers and climbers.

Marshall Matteo Laurilio, of the 
paramilitary police in Garessio said: 'The first call we got was from a 
member of the public, who had heard a low flying plane and then the 
sound of a crash. We then had a call from the airport to see it had 
disappeared from the radar screens.

Accident: Mr Tyler crashed his his five seater plane into the mountain side in thick fog, and Italian police and air officials are investigating the possibility that the airplane's altimeter was faulty

He added: 'The weather at the time was foggy but there were occasional breaks in the cloud but the plane did not clear the top of the mountain - we are looking at the possibility of a fault with the altimeter as he should not have been that low but at this stage is it too early for certain to say that was the cause.

''The plane had taken off at around 9.30 but it didn't crash until noon so it was flying around for more than two hours - there is also the possibility he may have got lost in the fog.

'Mr Tyson was killed instantly and no-one else was onboard. His body has been taken to a local hospital and the British Embassy in Rome has been informed of what happened. We think he was en route to France to pick up passengers but we are still investigating.''

Marshal Laurilio confirmed the plane's registration as G-CIZZ. Officials at Albenga said the plane had been headed towards Levaldilgi airport near Cuneo but refused to give any further details. The plane was owned by Mr Tyson who lived in Wargrave near Reading, Berkshire.

He is the director of the Bonanza Flying Club which is based in Eaton Terrace, Belgravia and company records show him as being with the firm for 19 years, fellow director Nigel Meek could not be reached for comment.

Tonight a Foreign Office spokesman said: ''We are aware of the incident and are providing consular assistance to the family.'
