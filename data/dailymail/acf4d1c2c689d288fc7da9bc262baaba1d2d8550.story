An 11-year-old girl blighted by a life-threatening illness has lived out her dream of being 'Princess for a day' thanks to the kindness of locals in Missouri.

Molly McKinley who has a severe form of ataxia, a rare neurological disorder which causes speech and motor problems, originally asked the Make-A-Wish Foundation for a trip to Disney World.

But with her condition making that impossible, the charity sought to give her a Disney-like party in Hannibal, a city of 17,000 residents about 100 miles north of St. Louis, and the community pitched in.

All smiles: Molly McKinley, who has a severe form of ataxia, a neurological disorder which causes speech and motor problems, lived out her dream of being 'Princess for a day' this week 

The party and fireworks show were kept a secret according to the The Hannibal Courier-Post, so Molly was surprised when she arrived Wednesday evening at the Mark Twain Brewing Co. on the town's historic Main Street. 

'What are these people doing here?' Molly asked her mother, before members of the fire department escorted her to the second floor for a prime view of the fireworks over the Mississippi River.

Ataxia affects the central nervous system, causing problems with balance and coordination. 

It often affects movement in the fingers, hands, arms and legs. 

It can also cause sight and speech problems.

Secondary complications, such as recurrent urinary tract infections and obstructive sleep apnea, can be life-threatening.

Ataxia can be caused by damage to a part of the brain known as the cerebellum, the spinal cord or peripheral nerves.

Some forms of the disease and conditions that trigger it are hereditary.

Treatment depends on the cause and physical therapy might help in some cases.

Molly's mother, Dawn Bricker, said the community's support for her daughter, who was diagnosed four years ago, was overwhelming.

'This is fabulous,' Bricker said.
