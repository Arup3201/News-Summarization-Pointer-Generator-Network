The body of Janelle Duncan-Bailey was found yesterday afternoon in Mayfield Crescent, Thornton Heath

A man has been charged with the murder of a mother after her body was found in a parked vehicle, Scotland Yard said today.

Jerome McDonald, 30, of Fairlands Avenue in Croydon, south London, is accused of killing Janelle Duncan-Bailey.

The 25-year-old mother of two went missing in south London in the early hours of Wednesday.

Officers found her body in a car yesterday afternoon in Mayfield Crescent, Thornton Heath.

Ms Duncan-Bailey left her children, boys aged two and seven, with a friend in Bromley while she attended a family function on Wednesday, police said.

She left the friend’s at about 4am to return to Thornton Heath, where at about 4.30am she visited her former partner’s home.

Police were called after reports of a domestic incident and Ms Duncan-Bailey left the address with officers.

It is believed she asked to be taken to another friend’s house in Limpsfield Avenue, Thornton Heath, and she was last seen between 5am and 5.30am walking towards flats there.

Ms Duncan-Bailey was reported missing later that day after she failed to collect her children.

On Friday, McDonald was arrested on suspicion of murder and taken to a south London police station for questioning.

Officers went to Mayfield Crescent yesterday and found Ms Duncan-Bailey’s body in a vehicle parked there.

Police said next of kin have been informed and a post-mortem examination is yet to be scheduled.

McDonald will appear at Camberwell Green Magistrates’ Court tomorrow.

Det Chief Insp Charles King, of the Homicide and Serious Crime Command, said: 'I would like to appeal to anyone who was in the Limpsfield Avenue area between 5am and 6am to make contact with us.

A man has now been charged with her murder, and will appear in court tomorrow

'Lots of people would have been out and about at that time of the morning, either on their way to work or walking dogs - they may have noticed a woman dressed so distinctively.

'Did you see a black woman around that time wearing a leopard-skin print dress and no shoes? If so, we want to hear from you.'

Anyone with information about Ms 
Duncan-Bailey should contact detectives from the Specialist Crime 
Directorate at Sutton police station on 0208 721 4054, or Crimestoppers 
on 0800 555 111.
