Sergei Polunin's reputation as an astonishing talent is matched only by his image as a temperamental 'bad boy'

He is an intense, charismatic and ambitious ballet prodigy who became the Royal Ballet’s youngest ever principal at the age of 19.

But Sergei Polunin’s reputation  as an astonishing talent is matched only by his image as a temperamental ‘bad boy’ who has walked out of not one, but two London productions.

He sent shockwaves through the dance world in April when he quit a much anticipated adaptation of Midnight Express – barely a year after he stormed out of the Royal Ballet, where he wowed in productions such as Alice’s Adventures In Wonderland.

At the time of his latest walkout, Polunin cited an unspecified ‘health issue’ for abandoning the London Coliseum production. But now producers are suing him for £400,000, claiming it was his wild partying that left him in no condition to perform.

Legal papers filed at the High Court accuse the troubled 23-year-old Ukrainian and his mentor Igor Zelensky, who also quit the production, of indulging ‘in a lifestyle which was not conducive to maintaining a sound state of health’.

The lawsuit, filed on behalf of producers Peter Schaufuss Ballet, continues: ‘They engaged in intensive and potentially debilitating social activity.’

The brilliant but erratic Polunin – who co-owns a London tattoo parlour – will have difficulty claiming a monastic devotion to his art.

When he abruptly fled the Royal Ballet in 2012, he revealed he had spent his nights clubbing, had taken drugs, and that he sometimes cut himself with razors for the adrenaline rush.

He has also admitted dancing while high on cocaine.

The legal papers reveal that the two dancers were due to be paid £7,000 for seven performances as American drug smugglers Billy and Tex – but they were also obliged to rehearse for two weeks before the show, for which they would each be paid £1,400.

When Polunin and Zelensky failed  to appear, the dance company was forced to hire two replacements, refund tickets worth £14,000 and reprint promotional material.

Producers also claim that ticket sales slumped when it became known that Polunin and Zelensky would not be dancing – a loss the company put ‘in the region of £400,000’.

To make matters worse, it is believed the Peter Schaufuss company had neglected to take out the usual insurance against the non-appearance of its stars.

According to the papers, both dancers emailed producers medical letters stating that they were not fit to work – but neither responded to the producers’ request to attend a medical examination.

Polunin is now working in Moscow but due to perform  at a gala at London’s Sadler’s Wells theatre tonight.

Neither dancer has commented on the legal action, but Polunin’s mother Galina said from Kiev:  ‘As I understand, neither side will be making public statements. I don’t know what their defence will be.’

Peter Schaufuss  did not return calls, while the company’s solicitors would not comment.
