The AOL boss at the center of the ‘distressed baby’ row allegedly called another female employee who lost three of her unborn quadruplets an ‘HR nightmare’.

Tim Armstrong was accused of firing Christina Elwell because she was unable to travel due to her troubled pregnancy.

The fact that she lost three of her babies before giving birth to the fourth made little difference to his decision, it was claimed.

The lawsuit was filed in 2005 and was 
dismissed in 2008 after going through arbitration but sheds new light on
 Armstrong’s recent comments.

Past problems: Tim Armstrong was accused of forcing a sales executive out when she was suffering a terrible pregnancy with quadruplets when he worked for Google

Spotlight: Armstrong's views of women at work were put under scrutiny after he accused two mothers of 'distressed babies' of being to blame for cutting AOL 401(k) benefits. One was Deanna Fei. They had their daughter, pictured shortly after birth, in October 2012. She was four months premature

He was criticized after revealing that AOL had cut benefits to employees after having to pay out $1 million to care for what he called two ‘distressed babies’.

Armstrong reversed the decision after a firestorm and because Deanna Fei, one of the mothers of the two children, wrote a scathing article in which she accused him of using her story as ‘an absurd justification for corporate cost-cutting’.

But this is not the first time he has been in trouble for his comments about female employees.

Miss Elwell’s lawsuit dates back to the time before Mr Armstrong joined AOL, where he is currently chief executive.

Before that he was Google’s vice president for national sales and was working out of their New York office, as was Miss Elwell.

In her lawsuit she says that by 2003 she had risen to National Sales Director where she was  ‘highly successful and well regarded’ and was managing the company’s North America sales force.

In February the next year she became pregnant with quadruplets and told Armstrong that this meant she could no longer travel.

Miss Elwell then lost two of her babies, a tragedy she informed Mr Armstrong about.

Nevertheless, the lawsuit claims, Miss Ewell claims that one day when she came in, he showed her a chart which revealed her job had been eliminated.

He allegedly tried to move to her to another role that would have been a ‘significant demotion’ - and the reason was because she could not travel by air.

Miss Elwell offered to take lesser role that would let her travel by train and car and Mr Armstrong is said to have accepted then allegedly ‘almost immediately’ changed his mind.

At a meeting on June 4 2004 the lawsuit claims that Mr Armstrong ‘told her that she was an HR nightmare and that he no longer wanted her in the New York office’.

Miss Elwell claimed that she was fired the next day over the phone by Mr Armstrong because he said it was the ‘right thing to do’.

The lawsuit states that during this period Miss Elwell was ‘in danger of losing another of her unborn children’ - her husband had apparently contacted Google to tell them she was going through a ‘health crisis’.

On June 29 2004 she then lost her third child. The reason for the child’s death is not explained in the lawsuit.

After negotiations Miss Elwell returned to work the following month but Mr Armstrong allegedly said he felt ‘uncomfortable’ around her and asked that she work from home.

She was signed off work by her doctor due to her ‘high-risk pregnancy’ and claims that she was cheated out of money owed from sales commissions - her checks were ‘substantially less’ than they should have been, according to the lawsuit.

Miss Elwell gave birth to her remaining child and towards the end of her maternity leave was looking forward to going back to work.

But she was allegedly told she would have to take a ‘low level operations position’ which she found ‘intolerable’.

In 2005 Miss Elwell was 'constructively dismissed' and filed a discrimination lawsuit with the backing of the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

Miss Elwell, 45, is now president of Manhattan-based CAC Media investing and Consulting, a marketing and advertising company.

Reached by phone Miss Elwell said: ‘I’m so sorry, I can’t comment. Of course I have thoughts (about Armstrong) but I really can’t comment.

‘It’s behind me now’.

AOL and Google have not responded to MailOnline's request for comment.

Google and Mr Armstrong were both named as defendants in the lawsuit. But at the time of the case Google said the claims were 'without merit' and vowed to fight the lawsuit 'vigorously'.

Ironically AOL's conference which aims to 'reset the agenda for women in the workplace' begins today, with Mr Armstrong due to be one of the speakers.
