Luke Shaw will seek talks with Southampton over his future after their final game of the season against Manchester United on Sunday.

Shaw, 18, is the subject of interest from several leading clubs in the Premier League and abroad and wants to know whether Southampton will allow him to leave.

The left-back is valued at £30million and is a candidate to be named in Roy Hodgson’s England World Cup squad on Monday having made his international debut earlier this year.

Talks: Luke Shaw will discuss his future with Southampton after the final Premier League game of the season

So far, Shaw has put speculation about his future to the back of his mind to concentrate on playing for Southampton but with the season drawing to a close, he doesn’t want a summer of uncertainty and is now seeking clarification from his current club.

Chelsea and Manchester United are expected to lead the bidding for the young defender who has already played 66 first-team games even though he doesn’t turn 19 until July.

Liverpool, Manchester City and Real Madrid also have an interest in Shaw, who is believed to be keen on a new challenge though he will want to be confident of playing regularly at any club he joins.

The teenager has shown huge loyalty to Southampton in recent years, making a name for himself as one of the brightest talents in the country in the process.

But with England's elite clubs, in particular Chelsea and Manchester United, in the market for left-backs this summer, there is a feeling that this will be the summer he finally departs.

The urgency to sign Shaw is unlikely to be as intense beyond the summer transfer window if Chelsea and United sign alternative left-backs, an issue that his advisors are aware of.

Sevilla's Alberto Moreno and Atletico Madrid's Filipe Luis have been scouted by both clubs.

Southampton may be forced for financial reasons to break up the impressive young squad they have assembled at St Mary’s.

The club posted a net loss of £7.1m in their last set of financial figures and will enter the summer window owing £27m in outstanding transfer fees.

A bill of £30million will also be due for their new training ground and director Han Hofstetter has admitted: ‘It is a burden that has to be covered and will be covered.’  

An added complication is the future of manager Mauricio Pochettino. The Argentine, very popular with Southampton’s players, has just one year left on his contract on the south coast and is on Tottenham Hostpur’s shortlist to be their new manager.

Italian giants AC Milan are also interested in Pochettino.
