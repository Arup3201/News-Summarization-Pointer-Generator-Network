A rare poster for the 1931 horror Frankenstein is set to fetch $225,000 at auction

One of the world's rarest movie posters for the classic horror Frankenstein has emerged for sale - for a staggering $225,000.

The 84-year-old poster for the cult 1931 film, which starred Boris Karlov as Dr Frankenstein's monster, is the only one of its kind in existence.  

It was discovered languishing in an old projection booth in a disused theatre in Long Island, New York during the 1970s before being restored to its former glory.

The 6ft 6ins by 3ft 5ins poster, known as a 'three sheet' because it is made up of three panels, has been in a private collection ever since.

Frankenstein was one of the first horror films ever made, and the poster is one of only a handful of originals known to have survived.

Collectors are expected to pay as much as $225,000 to get their hands on the coveted poster when it goes under the hammer at Heritage Auctions in Dallas, Texas.

A spokesman for Heritage Auctions said: 'Only a small handful of one sheets including one teaser, one six sheet, one insert, and a restored half sheet are all that have appeared of the posters, not including lobby cards,' the spokesman said.

'Offered in this lot is the only known copy of either of the two styles of three sheets created for the debut of the film.

'This is the Style C and is arguably the best graphic of the two styles. 

'It had apparently been used as a display for a number of reissues of the film with its counterpart Dracula, as was so often the case throughout the 1930s and 1940s.

'It underwent professional restoration and the poster now displays beautifully.'

The spokesman said posters for the film had always been 'infamously difficult to find'.

 'To say that the 1931 horror classic Frankenstein was monumental is an understatement of the impact it made on the audiences of the day,' the spokesman said.

'It remains the link that gets us where we are today in the evolution of the essentials of the horror film.

'Every cliché of cinema horror was created with this film - the mad scientist, the misunderstood monster, the angry villagers carrying torches, the dark laboratory filled with science fictional devices and the creepy assistant.

The 84-year-old poster for the cult 1931 movie, which starred Boris Karlov as Dr Frankenstein's monster, is the only one of its kind in existence. Pictured is a scene from the movie

'From the Creature of the Black Lagoon, to Leatherface in Texas Chainsaw, to Jason of Friday the 13th, and to all of the undead Zombies that followed, the hulking horror created by Boris Karloff, James Whale, and Jack Pierce influenced them all.' 

The auction will be held on March 28.

Last year, a poster for the 1927 classic London After Midnight went under the hammer for $478,000 breaking the record for the most valuable poster ever sold at public auction.

Heritage Auctions said the previous record was set 17 years earlier following the $453,500 sale of a poster for The Mummy.
