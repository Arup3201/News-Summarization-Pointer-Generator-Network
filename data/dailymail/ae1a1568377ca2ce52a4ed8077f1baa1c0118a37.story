Jerry Springer producer Jill Blackstone planned to kill herself with her sister Wendy in a suicide pact - but got cold feet at the last second and called a friend for help, according to police. 

Police told TMZ that both Jill and her sister Wendy, who was deaf and partially blind, made the decision to kill themselves along with their three dogs.

Jill was arrested last week for murder, but then later released without charge. She was pictured on Friday walking to her lawyer's office wearing large dark sunglasses that covered her eyes.

Jill, 52, allegedly set up a way to asphyxiate she and her sister in their garage with carbon monoxide but Jill became scared, called a friend, and the friend called 911, say law enforcement.

Neighbors say that Wendy was housebound very ill and that the sisters struggled to find a new that could accommodate them both and the dogs.

Jill was suffering from severe carbon monoxide poisoning.

The TV producer hid behind sunglasses and a baseball cap as a friend drove her to the house she had shared with her sister, whose death by asphyxiation is being treated as a murder by police.

The 52-year-old was visibly shaken as she approached the home, and she could be seen wiping her eyes after undergoing a particularly traumatic week.

Jill had initially been charged with Wendy’s murder, but the Los Angeles District Attorney dropped the charges and she was released on Wednesday afternoon.

Dog's died: Jill was an animal activist and there were three dogs found dead in the garage with her sister Wendy and it is believed the sisters planned on killing the animals during their suicide 

However, many questions remain over her partially blind and deaf sister’s death. Wendy was found on Saturday in the home’s garage, asphyxiated by carbon monoxide gas.

Also found at the scene was a handwritten suicide note, which police determined had been written by Jill. 

She was treated in hospital for effects of gas inhalation for two days before being discharged, at which time she was arrested.

Earlier, a police spokesperson emphasized Wendy’s death is still being treated as a murder.

LAPD officer Drake Madison told Daily Mail Online this is 'an ongoing murder investigation'.

'Jill Blackstone was arrested on Saturday but the District Attorney dropped the charges and she is no longer in custody. The investigation is still active and the police are looking for a murderer,' he added.

Asked if the police could re-arrest Jill, officer Madison said he had no further information to give at this time.

Neighbors have speculated the sisters – who ran the Thumping Tails Animal Rescue Center together out of their home – had entered into a suicide pact and police later voiced the same opinion.

Ongoing investigation: Police say the murder investigation is ongoing and that is possible that Jill could be re-arrested

Stephanie Cohen, 60, who lives across the street from the sisters said: ‘The police were here for 12 to 14 hours on Saturday. We were told they were investigating a double suicide, an attempt, and one of the people died.’

Numerous signs are posted on the property saying it is marked for demolition.

Stephanie added: ‘They were having a hard time finding a new home because the sister that died was very ill - she couldn’t see, she couldn’t hear, she was housebound, she was very ill. So she needed to find a house that could accommodate her sister with the illness and the dogs. Evidently the pressure was intense on them, but nobody expected this to happen.’

As a producer, Jill has worked on shows including Jerry Springer, Sally Jessy Raphael, The Rosie O'Donnell Show, Dr. Drew On Call, The Real, and The Osbournes.

On her Linkedin page she describes herself as: 'Some of you know me as a TV producer, others as an animal welfare advocate and dog rescuer. I'm all those things.’
