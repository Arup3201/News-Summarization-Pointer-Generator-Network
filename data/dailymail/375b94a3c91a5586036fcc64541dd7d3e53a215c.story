A teaching assistant drowned after he went skinny dipping during a New Year storm and had his neck broken by the force of a 15ft wave, an inquest heard.

Harry Swordy, 27, disappeared beneath the giant waves after wading into the swell off Loe Bar, a remote beauty spot near Porthleven, Cornwall, in the early hours of January 1.

He was with his sister and several friends when he and two others stripped down and ran naked into the swell, despite sea conditions being some of the worst in living memory due to a force nine storm.

The trio were knocked off their feet by the first wave to hit them and while Mr Swordy’s two friends managed to clamber ashore, he disappeared beneath the surface.

His sister Grace was waiting with the rest of the group on the shoreline but an inquest in Truro, Cornwall, heard their only glimpse of Mr Swordy was his silhouette being tossed into the air against a wall of foam.

Despite a huge search effort in the ferocious conditions, coastguards were unable to find him and his body washed up two days later.

His death came as authorities urged Britons to steer clear of coastal areas while the country was pounded by the fringes of the Atlantic mega-storm Hercules.

The inquest heard how Mr Swordy and his sister were among a group of 23 friends staying at a nearby bunkhouse for three days to see in the New Year.

The teaching assistant, originally from Guildford, Surrey, but working in Newton Abbot, Devon, had a meal and drank about three pints of beer and a shot of tequila.

Coroner Emma Carlyon said the swimmers had ignored two warning signs on Loe Bar itself but said she would be writing to the National Trust advising them to put more notices of the dangers up at local accommodation

He, along with friend Jonathan Burgess
 and another man, then decided to go for a moonlit swim and ignored 
warning signs as they raced into the sea at 1am.

Mr
 Burgess, a landscape gardener, told the inquest: ‘We drank some alcohol
 but I would not say anyone was drinking excessively or drunk.

‘We were running together towards the sea. Harry was a little bit ahead of me so he reached the water first.

Friends paid tribute to Mr Swordy in the wake of his death, describing him as an 'amazing character, so full of life, warmth and plans for the future'

‘A large wave came in and I just saw his silhouette, with his arms up, and he just got hit by this big wave.

‘It hit me and we were submerged. It was very shallow at that point but you could feel the drag of the current.

‘I didn't see Harry again. The waves were continuous. We looked for Harry, but there was no sign of him.’

The group began searching the beach and called 999, triggering a massive search and rescue mission involving coastguards, lifeboats and a Royal Navy helicopter from RNAS Culdrose.

For several hours the lifeboats battled through the surf and up to 20 rescuers combed the shoreline.

Coastguard sector manager Marc Thomas said the sea conditions were some of the most dangerous he had ever faced.

He said: ‘I can say the sea conditions at Loe Bar that morning were some of the worst I've seen in my career.

‘Loe Bar is an extremely dangerous place to swim even on a calm day and you should not swim there.’

The inquest heard how the 27-year-old’s body was identified by a tattoo saying ‘Freedom’ on his left arm.

A post-mortem found his lungs were 
filled with water but there was blood around the injury, meaning he was 
still alive when his neck was snapped.

Mr Swordy's death came as authorities urged Britons to steer clear of coastal areas while the country was pounded by the fringes of the Atlantic mega-storm Hercules in the early hours of January 1

Coroner Emma Carlyon said the swimmers had ignored two warning signs on Loe Bar itself but said she would be writing to the National Trust advising them to put more notices up at local accommodation.

She recorded a verdict of accidental death caused by immersion in rough seas.
