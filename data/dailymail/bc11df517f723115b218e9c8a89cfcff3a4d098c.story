A drowning boy was rescued by a group of beach-goers who formed a human chain to drag him from the powerful surf yesterday. 

Joshua McQuoid, 12, from Napier, New Zealand, was paddling when he was knocked off his feet and pulled into the sea by the strong undertow.

His friend Hikiroa Ratapu raised the alarm but the current was so strong that rescuers, led by a German tourist and two policemen, were also repeatedly knocked down.

Heroes: About a dozen people formed a human chain to pull a boy, 12, from the churning surf in New Zealand

It was only when about 12 passers-by 
held hands to form a human chain that they were finally steady enough to
 hold onto the schoolboy and pass him onto the beach at Napier's Marine 
Parade.

Joshua was unconscious when he was finally rescued from the water and was given first aid on the sand.

He was then taken to Hawke's Bay Hospital and discharged later that day.

Napier
 Constable Paul Bailey told the Taranaki Daily News website that the boy
 would have drowned if he had not been able to pass the child along the 
human chain.

He said at one stage Joshua became lost in the surf and had become a 'dead weight' through exhaustion.

But the waves luckily knocked the schoolboy against Mr Bailey's legs and he was able to grab him.

He told the website: 'Then we saw the human chain they'd formed and I was able to pass him over.'

Rescue: Joshua McQuoid's friend Hikiroa Ratapu called for help when the schoolboy was dragged deeper into the sea and within seconds beach-goers rushed to the water to form a human chain

Joshua said the water was only knee-deep and was surprised by how strong the waves were.

He told Taranaki Daily News: 'It was really hard, it flipped me around heaps of times. I didn't know which way was up.'

He told his father that the experience was like being inside a washing machine.

Police said the boy was underwater for up to 20 seconds at a time as he was rolled over by the waves.

His father thanked 'each and every person' who helped save his son's life during an interview with Radio New Zealand.

He also paid tribute to 'little hero' Hikiroa for raising the alarm and not jumping in to the surf after his friend.

Video of the 'touching' rescue effort filmed by a young bystander has already been viewed hundreds of times after being posted online.

Conditions on the day were said to be 'treacherous with dumping waves and an extremely strong undertow.'

Joshua's mother Kath Kuru had been ringing her son to tell him to come home for dinner.

She said she did not even know he had gone to the beach but have her 'heartfelt thanks' to all those who helped rescue him.
