Lee Rigby's murderers had threatened bystanders and police with a 'cowboy' gun from the 1920s that could not be fired.

After hacking the soldier to death, Michael Adebowale's role was the wave the weapon at those who tried to approach them.

The killer, 22, and his accomplice Michael Adebolajo, 28, had hoped that by having the gun the police would shoot them dead and send them to 'paradise' as martyrs.

But although they were shot by police marksmen in Woolwich, they survived.

The pair were today found guilty of hacking Fusilier Lee Rigby, 25, to death and nearly decapitating him outside Woolwich Barracks in May.

'Weapon': Lee Rigby's murderers brandished this 9.4mm KNIL model 91 revolver from the 1920s which could not be fired

Target: Lee Rigby was chosen because he was wearing this military-style rucksack. His killers admitted they could not be completely sure he was in the military

Adebolajo claimed they are not murderers because they are 'soldiers of Allah' at 'war' with Britain over its foreign policy.

He kissed the Qu'ran and smiled as he was found guilty today while Adebowale showed no emotion. They will both be sentenced next month.

The court heard the pair brandished a 9.4mm KNIL model 91 revolver, manufactured between 1920 and 1922 at the scene in the hope they would be shot dead by police.

Their twisted plan for martyrdom effectively backfired when police shot the pair - but managed to avoid killing them.

Testing later revealed it could not be used to fire ammunition and only worked after the moving parts were oiled and lubricated.

Adebowale has lost at least the thumb on his right hand after he waved it at police after already being shot.

Asked when Adebolajo had tried, unsuccessfully, to buy bullets for the gun, he said: ‘I will not be specific, but it was a long time before the incident.’

Guilty: Murderers Michael Adebolajo, who 
described himself as a 'soldier of Allah', attempted to decapitate 
Drummer Rigby while Michael Adebowale hacked at his body in the most 
appalling crime

He said they chose Fusilier Rigby because he was wearing an army-style rucksack, but admitted they were not completely sure that he was in the Army.

The first armed officer on the scene, named only as E48, said Adebowale was shot in the leg and stomach, and when he raised his arm holding the gun they fired twice at his hand and blew off a digit.

‘He raised one of his arms up. I’ve still got a distinct image in my mind of him holding a black revolver in his hand,’ he told the court.

‘The next two shots shot his thumb off. The hand holding the weapon’.
