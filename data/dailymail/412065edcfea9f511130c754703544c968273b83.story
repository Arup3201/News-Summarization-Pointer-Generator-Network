They have danced around the moon for almost a year, making detailed maps of its interior.

Flying in formation over the lunar surface, the two NASA probes - named Ebb and Flow - helped further our understanding of the early solar system.

But Monday, in a dramatic climax to their mission, the two spacecraft plunged seconds apart into a mountain near the moon's North Pole.

Afterward, NASA said it had dedicated the impact site in honor of mission team member, Sally Ride, the first American woman in space who died earlier this year.

Mapping the moon: Using a precision formation-flying technique, the twin GRAIL spacecraft -- Ebb and Flow -- have mapped the Moon's gravity field, as depicted in this artist's rendering.

By design, the spot was far away from the Apollo landings and other historical sites.

With their fuel running low, NASA was keen to prevent them from crashing near the historically important Apollo landing sites.

And even the keenest stargazer would 
not have spotted the two-washing machine sized probes as they impacted 
at a speed of 3,800mph, as the collisions occurred on the dark side of 
moon.

But NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance 
Orbiter which circles the moon will soon be passing over the site and 
will attempt to photograph the skid marks after the craft slammed into 
the surface.

The mission, codenamed Grail - 
Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory - was launched in September 
2011 from Cape Canaveral and has been deemed a success.

The twin craft collected data about 
the moon's gravity while orbiting at an average altitude of 34 miles, 
revealing its surface is much thinner than previously thought, gouged 
out by the impact of thousands of asteroids and comets.

'It is going to be difficult to say 
goodbye to our little robotic twins,' says MIT professor Maria Zuber, 
Grail principal investigator. 'Planetary science has advanced in a major
way because of their contributions.' Ebb and Flow conducted one final 
experiment before their mission ends, firing their main engines until 
their propellant tanks are empty in a bid to determine precisely the 
amount of fuel left in their tanks.

NASA engineers hope this information will help improve predictions of fuel needs for future missions.

'Our lunar twins may be in the 
twilight of their operational lives, but one thing is for sure, they are
going down swinging,' said Grail project manager David Lehman of NASA's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California.

A successful mission: The map created by Ebb and Flow has revealed an incredibly pulverized lunar crust, suggesting the moon, Earth, Mars, Mercury and Venus were pounded by long-ago impacts far more violently than previously thought.

Blast Off: The $496 million Grail mission - short for Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory - launched in September 2011, and Ebb and Flow reportedly arrived in lunar orbit about three months later.

'Even during the last half of their 
last orbit, we are going to do an engineering experiment that could help
future missions operate more efficiently.' The twin craft focused 
exclusively on measuring the moon's lumpy gravity field in a bid to 
learn more about its interior and early history.

'After flying in formation for months, they produced the most detailed gravity maps of any body in the solar system.

Since the dawn of the Space Age, more
than 100 missions have involved the moon, including Nasa's six Apollo 
landings that put 12 astronauts on the surface.

The last time the US space agency 
intentionally fired a man-made object at the moon was in 2009, but it 
was for the sake of science. Spectators on Earth barely saw the faintest
of flashes, but the experiment proved that the moon contained water.

'Grail has produced the 
highest-resolution, highest-quality gravity field for any planet in the 
solar system, including Earth,' Zuber reportedly said.

The
resulting map has revealed an incredibly pulverized lunar crust, Zuber 
added, suggesting that the moon, Earth, Mars, Mercury and Venus were 
pounded by long-ago impacts far more violently than previously thought.

Mission
managers on Friday turned off Ebb and Flow's science instruments and 
ordered a maneuver putting themÂ  on course for the rim of the crater, 
which reportedly sits at a latitude of 75.62 degrees north and a 
longitude of 26.63 degrees east.

More than 100 missions have been flung to Earth's nearest neighbor since the dawn of the Space Age including NASA's six Apollo moon landings that put 12 astronauts on the surface.

The demise of Ebb and Flow comes on the same month as the 40th launch anniversary of Apollo 17, the last manned mission to the moon.

Ebb and Flow focused exclusively on measuring the moon's lumpy gravity field in a bid to learn more about its interior and early history. After flying in formation for months, they produced the most detailed gravity maps of anybody in the solar system.

Secrets long held by the moon are spilling out. Ebb and Flow discovered that the lunar crust is much thinner than scientists had imagined. And it was severely battered by asteroids and comets in the early years of the solar system - more than previously realized.

Data so far also appeared to quash the theory that Earth once had two moons that collided and melded into the one we see today.

Besides a scientific return, the mission allowed students to take their own pictures of craters and other lunar features as part of collaboration with a science education company founded by Ride, who died in July of pancreatic cancer at age 61.

bout 3,600 classrooms around the world participated, sending back 114,000 photos.

Scientists expect to sift through data and images from the $487 million mission for years.
