Sir Richard Branson claims staff from his Necker Island retreat had to rescue Olympic sailor Sir Ben Ainslie after he ran into trouble sailing in the area on his honeymoon.

The Virgin boss said the four-times gold medallist ran into difficulties when a furling system, which controls the sail being rolled out, broke.

The British Olympian was on honeymoon with his new wife Georgie Thompson, after they married at Hampton Court Palace last month, when the incident occurred.

Sir Richard said the couple were holidaying near Necker Island, in the British Virgin Islands, when they encountered the problem and Ainslie was forced to radio for help.

Members of the island's watersports team - Marco Bava, George Lambert and Adam Chubbock -helped to cut the sail and avoid the vessel being wrecked on a nearby reef.

Writing on his blog, Sir Richard commented: 'It was great to see Ben Ainslie sailing past Necker Island as he enjoyed his honeymoon with his delightful new wife Georgie Thompson.

The newlyweds didn't let their sailing disaster dampen their honeymoon and joined Sir Richard for a few days on Necker Island

Sir Richard tweeted about the incident and wrote a post on his blog saying he had never expected to rescue an Olympic sailor from a boat

'Seeing as Ben is one of the greatest sailors of all time, what we didn’t except to see was his boat getting into trouble!'

The three helpful workers managed to cut the sail, which could not be raised or lowered due to the major technical problem.

Sir Richard said: 'Unsurprisingly, Ben kept an amazingly cool head whilst directing operations - he just needed more hands to sort out the mess.' 

The Virgin boss has also invited the couple to stay on his island for a few days. 

Ainslie and TV sports presenter Georgie only announced their engagement last October and married on December 20.

The couple were married at the end of December and enjoyed some time in Antigua before heading out on a yacht around the British Virgin Islands

Announcing the news, Ainslie, who has four Olympic gold medals and one silver to his name, wrote on his Twitter account: 'Picture says it all. So happy to be engaged to the loveliest woman in the World. Biggles is pretty excited too!'

Thompson then posted on her account, saying, rather accurately: 'This just in… @AinslieBen and I are getting married! Couldn't be happier. Suspect the honeymoon may involve a boat..:)'

After their wedding, the couple were spotted walking arm in arm in Antigua before embarking on the second part of their honeymoon.
