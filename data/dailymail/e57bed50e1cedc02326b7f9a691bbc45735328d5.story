I don't know how it happened, but suddenly my daughter Valentina is about to turn 18. I wanted to spend some time together - just the two of us - before she flies the nest. 

We've always lived in London, but Valentina has a keen interest in the animal world and longed to know more about the mysterious orca whale.

We decided we would see these magnificent creatures in their natural habitat. Skimming the internet, I found a site called Sea Kayak Adventures, offering a five-day sea kayaking trip in the middle of August in northern British Columbia, Canada.

We would kayak to base camp on the Johnstone Strait and from there take daily excursions, paddling among the pods of orcas that come back year after year during the months of July and August. 

The website said there would be a 97 per cent chance of seeing an orca during these two months. I booked immediately.

The weekend before our departure, a kit list arrived by email. It was also clear from our itinerary that we would be without any showers, hot water, electrical power or wi-fi during our time in the wilderness.

We were told to bring fast-drying synthetic clothes and whittle our possessions down to the essentials. Valentina insisted on bringing her camera equipment, which turned out to be a wise choice.

We flew to Vancouver, took a small aircraft to Port Hardy, and then drove to Telegraph Cove. Even the experience of preparing for the expedition was exciting.

Valentina, who normally expresses all the usual teenage behaviour and reactions, could not have been a more delightful and relaxed travel companion. 

We laughed out loud when we were given our two tiny watertight kitbags, which would contain our only belongings for the next five days and which we would carry in our kayak.

When they 'breach', they jump fully out of the water; a 'spy hop' involves them having a quick look around to see what's going on; and at night they 'fin slap', which sounds like a gun going off 

Our group also included a couple, a single man, Joe, and two excellent guides, Julia and Qui.

We set off from Telegraph Cove after a briefing on safety, security and weather conditions.

On that first day, we kayaked down the strait to a beautiful stony beach where we ate lunch - salad, eggs, ham, cheese and fruit - prepared by Julia and Qui. 

Afterwards, as we headed back towards camp, we found ourselves right in the path of a pod.

They were moving quickly towards us, occasionally with their fins above the water and 'blowing' through their noses. Watching these animals glide majestically through the water was breathtaking.

The guide had asked us to 'raft' our kayaks together so that we could make a larger body in the water above them.

They submerged about 300ft in front of us, and I hardly dared breathe as they swam beneath us. I could have reached out and touched them.

From that moment on we realised that humans really do not belong in a place like the Johnstone Strait. The animal kingdom was around us at all times: sea lions, humpback whales, bald eagles, jellyfish, dolphins, porpoises.

This was their world, not ours. Our base camp was beautiful, our tent pitched just a few yards from the beach. Our bathroom, meanwhile, was a makeshift wooden cubicle some distance away in the woods.

We quickly fell asleep on our first night, but I awoke with a start to what sounded like a bear cracking through the undergrowth. 

A few minutes later I realised it was squirrels high up in the trees above throwing nuts and cones down on to our tent. Julia and Qui laughed at me, and assured me that bears and cougars are a very rare sight in Telegraph Cover.

Valentina and I spent five extraordinary days in the Johnstone Strait. The water was calm and the sun shone brightly.

We tracked pods every day. At times they would come and scratch their backs just yards from the beach at our base camp.

In the morning the whales would gun down the Strait as if they were on the school run, then at dusk they would drift back slowly, as if they were heading home at the end of a busy day. We soon learned something of their habits. 

When they 'breach', they jump fully out of the water; a 'spy hop' involves them having a quick look around to see what's going on; and at night they 'fin slap', which sounds like a gun going off.

Our guides told us not to be frightened as no one has ever been hurt, let alone killed, by a whale in the Johnstone Strait.

Julia had a microphone that goes underwater and when the whales were close we could listen to them communicating with each other as any family would do.

It was a deeply emotional experience to hear them conversing, especially knowing the terrible isolation they experience in confinement and captivity. 

The local whale-watching boats know the pods well. Each pod has a name and can be distinguished by the sound of their communication under the water - each family makes different sounds.

Every day was more beautiful than the last. We became calm and relaxed among the whales, waiting for them to reappear, then easing back in our kayaks to take photographs. 

We grew accustomed to the quiet, and it was a relief to be far away from home, with no access to emails or phones.

On our final night after dinner we added to the collected sculpture of pebbles left by previous kayakers - stones rendered heart-shaped by the lap of the waves. 

I asked Valentina if she had ever been in a situation where there was no wi-fi, no connectivity, and no communication with her friends - a time when she was simply a human being in the stillness of our planet.

She said that while she missed talking to her friends and sharing her experiences, she actually found it deeply relaxing not to have to listen to the constant chatter.

On the final night I was desperate for a shower. Without one, I opted for the next best thing - a dip in the freezing sea. It crossed my mind that I was swimming in Mother Nature's pool.

Julietta and Valentina came face to face with a black bear during their trip

The next morning I walked alone down to the creek to take in the unbelievable beauty of our surroundings one last time. That's when I spotted a big black bear right in front of me, grunting through his huge nostrils.

As soon as he saw me he started to lollop away into the undergrowth. I stood still, then shouted to Valentina that she should come outside with her camera.

The bear hung around just long enough for her to take an out-offocus photograph.

An adventure like this was made much more special for me because I shared it with my daughter. 

Travelling can be stressful, but we were almost always in good spirits, and in harmony with one another. We have memories that will never leave us. 

To have an experience like that with my daughter who will soon embark on adult life was something I shall treasure for ever.

I know she enjoyed every second of it too.
