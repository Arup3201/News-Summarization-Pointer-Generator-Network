Courage: Lance Corporal James Ashworth is only the tenth British soldier to be awarded the Victoria Cross since the Second World War

The country’s highest award for gallantry is to be awarded to a British soldier who died protecting his comrades in Afghanistan.

Lance Corporal James Ashworth is to be granted the Victoria Cross (VC) for an extraordinary act of heroism in Helmand Province last June.

The 23-year-old soldier of the 1st Battalion The Grenadier Guards was looked up to by his fellow soldiers who have described him in eulogies as ‘loved by everyone’.

He was serving with a reconnaissance platoon in the Nahr-e-Siraj district last summer, when his platoon became engaged in a battle with Taliban insurgents.

He is understood to have fought with extraordinary courage against all odds until he was killed by a grenade.

His acts, which involved deliberately exposing himself to enemy fire, saved his comrades’ lives.

Officials said he had also taken care to ensure that there were no civilians in the line of fire,

James Ashworth, from Kettering, Northamptonshire, will become the tenth member of the British Army to be awarded the honour since the Second World War.

His unit was left grief stricken by the loss of the soldier who had already acquired extensive combat experience during a previous tour of Afghanistan and had been promoted shortly before his death.

In eulogies published by the MoD days after his death, Lance Corporal Ashworth’s comrades paid tribute to a soldier ‘bound for great things’ and whose courage ‘humbled’ those around him.

Captain Mike Dobbin, his company commander, said: ‘Lance Corporal Ashworth was killed while fighting his way through compounds; leading his fire team from the front, whilst trying to protect his men; and he showed extraordinary courage to close on a determined enemy.’

Guardsman Jordan Loftus said: ‘Selfless, brave, courageous — words like these don’t come close to what Ash demonstrated that day.’

His family paid to tribute to him after his death, saying: ‘We are devastated by the loss of our son, brother, uncle and boyfriend. He meant the world to everyone and has left an irreplaceable hole in our hearts.’

The Ashworth family has since raised money for the British Limbless Ex-Service Men’s Association by cycling from London to Edinburgh.

The VC is awarded for valour ‘in the face of the enemy’ to members of the armed forces of various Commonwealth countries, and previous British Empire territories. It takes precedence over all other orders, decorations and medals.

It was introduced on 29 January 1856 by Queen Victoria to honour acts of valour during the Crimean War.

The Victoria Cross ranks as the nation's highest award for gallantry, along with the George Cross.

Instituted by Queen Victoria in 1856, the Victoria Cross is awarded for 'most conspicuous bravery, or some daring or pre-eminent act of valour or self-sacrifice, or extreme devotion to duty in the presence of the enemy.'

The bronze cross, which has a crimson ribbon bears the inscription 'For Valour', is cast from the metal of Russian guns captured at the siege of Sevastopol during the Crimean War, the campaign in which the first medals were awarded.

The Victoria Cross may be awarded to all ranks of the services - and also to civilians - to recognise gallantry in the presence of the enemy.

The medal has been awarded 1,356 times, the most recent of which was a posthumous award to Corporal Bryan Budd, of the 3rd Battalion The Parachute Regiment, for acts of "inspirational leadership and the greatest valour" in southern Afghanistan in 2006.

Only 13 Victoria Cross medals have been awarded since the Second World War, nine to members of the British Army and four to the Australian Army.

L/Cpl Ashworth's is just the fifth to have been awarded since the Falklands conflict, and all but one have been posthumous.

Private Johnson Beharry, from 1st Battalion the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment, was awarded the honour for two separate acts of outstanding gallantry to rescue his comrades in Iraq in 2004, during which suffered serious head injuries.

The Victoria Cross has been awarded to the same person twice on three occasions - to doctors Captain Arthur Martin-Leake (1902 and 1914) and Captain Noel Chavasse (1916 and posthumously 1917), and New Zealander Captain Charles Upham (1941 and 1942).

The George Cross, which stands equal to the Victoria Cross as an award, recognises acts of gallantry by members of the Armed Forces or civilians in situations for which the Victoria Cross is not appropriate.

These can be incidents that are not in the presence of the enemy, such as bomb or mine disposal.
