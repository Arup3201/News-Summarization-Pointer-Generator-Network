A California mother couldn't believe her eyes or ears when she gave birth to a record-breaking 15 pound baby by Caesarean last week.

Andrew Jacob Cervantez was 24 inches long and 15 lb, 2 oz in weight when he was delivered to 28-year-old Vanessa Cervantez at Desert Valley Hospital, Victorville, on Thursday.

The huge newborn is thought to be heaviest ever born in California and is bigger than last year's largest baby, a 14lb boy born in Ohio in May 2013.

'I couldn't even believe it,' Cervantez told Victor Valley Daily Press. 'They had to double check because I didn't believe them; I thought the machine was broken.'

The heaviest baby ever was 23 lb, 12 oz and born to Canadian giantess Anna Bates in 1879. But while Bates measured over 7 feet, Cervantez is a much more modest 5'1".

The mother of two said that her other children were also heavy at birth, weighing 10 lb, 10 oz and 9 lb, 14 oz respectively, but she hadn't expected to deliver a baby the size of Andrew Jacob.

'None of the doctors have ever delivered or heard of a baby being born that big here,' Cervantez, who is married to 29-year-old Daniel Cervantez, explained to the Daily Press.Â

'My sister's been doing research and she doesn't think a baby weighing 15 pounds has ever been born in California,' the mother continued.

Cervantez was 38 weeks pregnant when she went into hospital for routine tests on Thursday. When medics noticed decreased fetal movement they immediately performed a Caesarean operation.

Andrew Jacob is currently in Loma Linda Children's Hospital. 'He's having trouble breathing on his own,' Cervantez said, 'that's what they're monitoring him for right now.'
