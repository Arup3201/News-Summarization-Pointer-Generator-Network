A mother died after suffering a severe allergic reaction caused by L’Oreal hair dye, an inquest heard yesterday.

Julie McCabe, 39, was rinsing out the dye when she ‘screamed loudly’ and gasped at her husband: ‘I’m struggling to breathe, I think I’m going to die.’

She fell into a coma and died 12 months later in hospital without regaining consciousness.

Julie McCabe, 39, died after suffering an extreme reaction to L'Oreal hair dye, inquest hears

The coroner, Geoff Fell, said he believed it was only the second death in the UK resulting from hair colourant.

Mrs McCabe, an estate agent, coloured her hair dark brown every month despite a long history of low-grade allergic reactions to the dye, the inquest at Skipton, North Yorkshire was told.

She went to her local health centre 16 to 20 times in six years because of the issue and suffered at least ten allergic reactions to hair dye products.

November 2012:

After over a year in a coma, the 39-year-old dies from heart failure due to brain damage.

Doctors prescribed a cream to rub into her skin and scalp which dealt with the minor rashes and itchiness. None of the GPs believed her life could be in danger from her allergy.

Yet she suffered an anaphylactic reaction, in what her doctor described as a ‘unique’ incident that led to fatal brain damage.

Mrs McCabe’s husband Russell, 47, said he had heard his wife ‘screaming loudly from upstairs’ after going to wash out her dye. 

He saw her slumped against a wall gasping for air. ‘She said, “Russell, I’m struggling to breathe, I think I’m going to die”.’ He dialled 999 but became impatient with the emergency operator and decided to drive his wife the three miles to Airedale Hospital in Keighley.

Mr McCabe said: ‘I went outside and discovered Julie was on her hands and knees in the driveway, gasping for breath. I just thought Julie was having a severe asthma attack.’

During the short journey from their home in Cowling, North Yorkshire, Mrs McCabe lost consciousness. 

Medics were working on her within seconds of Mrs McCabe arriving at hospital, but she had already suffered a major cardiac arrest.

The incident happened in October 2011. Mrs McCabe remained in a coma and died in November 2012. The cause of death was given as cardiorespiratory arrest as a result of severe brain damage.

Dr Sean Emmott, one of her GPs, said she would have been advised that the way to stop the allergic reactions would be to stop using the hair dye.

Dr Shuaib Nasser, an allergy expert, said: ‘The hair colouring was the cause of the severe allergic reaction. The continued regular use probably contributed to the severity of the reaction.’

The hearing was told Mrs McCabe was taken to Airedale General Hospital after he collapse

Anaphylactic shock is a severe allergic reaction where the body’s immune system over-reacts in response to a substance that it wrongly perceives as a threat.

It can be triggered by substances including peanuts, latex, drugs, insect stings shellfish and even fruit.

The product used by Mrs McCabe, whose children were aged 16 and 21 when she died, was L’Oreal Recital Preference shade one. 

Brian Lightfoot, a chemist from L’Oreal, said the chemical para-phenylenediamine in the dye used by Mrs McCabe comprised just 1 per cent of the substance put into her hair.

He said the incident was reported to the authorities as soon as the company was told about it. The inquest continues.
