Queens Park Rangers will kick off their summer transfer business by securing the free transfer signing of Rio Ferdinand.

At first glance it may seem like the Loftus Road club are falling into the same traps that characterised their previous ill-fated stint in the top-flight.

Paying top dollar for over-hyped stars, only in London for one last pay day. For this read Jose Bosingwa and Chris Samba.

Out with the old: Rio Ferdinand left Man Utd on a free transfer this summer following 12 years service

Done it all: Ferdinand enjoyed a trophy laden career at United, including winning the 2008 Champions League

But with the capture of Ferdinand, you'll have to dig a little deeper. Yes, Ferdinand is 35-years-old, and yes he has very little to prove after a trophy-laden career at Manchester United.

But where Ferdinand differs from Bosingwa et al is that he actually actually cares.

Can you see Ferdinand laughing as he trudges off the pitch just minutes after his side were relegated from the Premier League?

Not a chance. His long-lasting relationship with manager Harry Redknapp would see to that.

Ferdinand knows he owes much to Redknapp for giving him his chance at West Ham as a teenager. And now the pair are reunited at the twilight of his career, Ferdinand has the chance to repay Redknapp for giving him his big break at Upton Park.

In Ferdinand, Rangers have someone who will make every single member of the squad a better player. Not only by what he does on the pitch on Saturday, but simply by just being there.

Having someone of Ferdinand's stature in and around the club's Harlington HQ will only serve to enhance their training sessions.

For instance, if QPR's pursuit of Cardiff central defender Steven Caulker proves successful, then who better than Ferdinand to help nurture the former Tottenham man's talents?

Ferdinand's a leader in every sense of the word, and QPR will only benefit from his experience. It is, of course, unlikely that Ferdinand can play an entire 38 game Barclays Premier League season.

With a string of injuries and over 700 career appearances to his name, playing twice a week maybe be a stretch too far. But when he is available, rest assured QPR's back-four will be better for it.

Mutual respect: Redknapp helped start Ferdinand's professional career while manager at West Ham

Back in the big time: Redknapp guided QPR back into the Premier League at the first opportunity after winning the Championship play-offs in May

While Redknapp has been desperate to push through his move for Ferdinand for weeks, there has been some hesitation from the powers that be at Loftus Road about his signing.

That's understandable. Once bitten, twice shy and all that. They still have lingering reminders of the over-spending that has threatened the financial stability of the club.

Loic Remy, who earns £80,000-per-week, is still contract to the club; as are Shaun Wright-Phillips and Julio Cesar, who both earn in excess of £60,000-per-week. 

But taking a former England international, Premier League and Champions League winner on a free transfer, for 12 months on a basic wage of around £50,000-per-week seems pretty low risk business.

And this time next sure Rangers' money men will be laughing over their reluctance to complete Ferdinand's transfer.
