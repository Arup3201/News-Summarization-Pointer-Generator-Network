Mark Carney yesterday said he would not raise interest rates for some time, even as Britain’s economy records the strongest growth in the developed world.

The Bank of England’s Governor confirmed that borrowing costs will not rise when unemployment falls below 7 per cent – a threshold the Bank set for considering an increase less than six months ago.

Mr Carney also said that any eventual increases ‘would be gradual’ and lead to rates ‘somewhat lower than before the crisis’, when they averaged about 5 per cent.

The comments, to British executives at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, were welcomed by the audience. One business leader said borrowing costs ‘should remain low to help sustain the recovery’.

George Osborne said merely discussing the possibility of higher interest rates was ‘a mark of success’ for the economy, as it shows ‘we have started to see the recovery take off’ – but added that ‘there is not a need for an immediate rise’.

The Chancellor, who was also in Davos, would prefer that interest rates do not rise until after next May’s general election.

However, with the economy powering ahead, the jobless rate falling and concern growing about a credit boom, the interest rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee could feel the need to act before then.

The Bank’s base rate has been at 0.5 per cent since March 2009, but the economic revival has fuelled speculation that the MPC could soon raise it for the first time in nearly seven years. Experts have warned that the move, which would hammer millions of families with mortgages, could snuff out the UK recovery. In August, with unemployment at 7.8 per cent, the Bank said it would not consider raising rates until the jobless figure fell to 7 per cent – something it did not expect to happen until late 2016.

The unemployment rate fell sharply to 7.1%, putting it within a whisker of the 7% target set by the Bank of England when it could consider putting up interest rates

The policy – known as forward guidance
 – is now set for the scrapheap after data this week showed unemployment
 has fallen to 7.1 per cent. Mr Carney said the MPC will ‘evolve’ and 
‘update’ its forward guidance next month.

The
 Bank has several options. It could ditch the link between joblessness 
and interest rates altogether; lower the threshold to 6.5 or 6 per cent;
 or incorporate other indicators such as wage growth.

Chancellor George Osborne has previously warned about the dangers of an interest rate rise

The Governor said that although the UK, along with the US, is ‘leading the pack’ in terms of economic growth in the developed world, there are nearly 750,000 more Britons out of work than before the financial crisis struck, and another 750,000 part-time workers who want a full-time job.

‘Many of the headwinds holding back the economy will remain for some time yet,’ the Canadian said. ‘A few quarters of growth driven by household spending represent a good start, but they aren’t sufficient.’ The Chancellor agreed: ‘The job is not done. It is not even half done.’ He said the next step would be for business investments and exports to become ‘key components’ of the recovery.

Mr Carney stressed in his speech: ‘Even though unemployment is falling faster than expected, the recovery has some way to run before it would be appropriate to consider moving away from the emergency setting of [interest rates] ... It is widely recognised that our 7 per cent threshold is not a trigger.’

David Cameron, who was also in Davos, defended Mr Carney. ‘To be fair, he always said that this was a threshold, not a trigger,’ he told Bloomberg television, adding that the Governor’s latest comments are ‘consistent with that’.

John Cridland, the head of the Confederation of British Industry and a member of Mr Carney’s audience yesterday, said: ‘Business will welcome the Governor’s comments on interest rates. Interest rates should remain low to help sustain the recovery.’

However, former Bank of England economist Rob Wood said there was a 30 per cent chance of a rate increase by the end of the year, claiming such a move would be necessary ‘in late 2014’.

As economic recovery builds, unemployment has fallen to just 7.1%

The Bank has denied reports that Mr Carney wants the Chancellor to water down the Help to Buy scheme to prevent a new housing boom. A spokesman said claims that Mr Carney wanted the maximum loan to be reduced from £600,000 were ‘completely without foundation’.
