Reginald Davies, 78, was found guilty of abusing four girls between 1949 and 1973 at Kingston Crown Court in Surrey

A former soldier with the Royal Engineers has been found guilty of sexually assaulting four young girls in what is thought to be the oldest criminal case in UK history.

Reginald Davies, 78, committed the attacks between 1949 and 1973 but was only extradited from Australia and brought to justice after two of his victims confronted him in 2008.

The Welshman, who also served with the Royal Dragoons, was convicted of 13 offences, including the rape of a girl under the age of 12 all committed when he was aged between 15 and 39.

Two of his victims were present at Kingston Crown Court in south west London and wept as the verdict was read out.

He will be sentenced on Friday with Judge Susan Tapping warning him that he faced a 'substantial sentence'.

During the trial, prosecutor Hanna Llewellyn-Waters said Davies 'preyed on the innocence' of the four girls, who were aged between nine and 16 at the time.

She said: 'You relied on their fear that they would not be believed and told them that they would be taken away from everything they loved.'

The former miner abused his victims in South Wales before moving to Australia in 1974.

He was confronted by two of his victims in 2008 while they were on holiday in the country and a third victim later came forward to police, who found the fourth woman after an investigation was launched. 

Davies was arrested last July at his adopted home of Wanneroo on Australia’s west coast and extradited in September last year.

The pensioner was found guilty of two
charges of child rape, two charges of attempted rape, eight counts of 
indecent assault and one count of indecency with a child.

He was cleared of one charge of child rape and one charge of attempted rape.

Judge Tapping said Davies - who was living in Hertfordshire with his wife during the trial - would have to sign the sex offenders register, and adjourned sentencing until Friday.

Mark Kimsey, defending, asked for bail to allow him to 'get his house in order' but Davies was remanded in custody.

Following the verdict Hilary Ryan, senior Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) lawyer, said: 'This is one of the oldest cases of historic sexual abuse and rape ever prosecuted by the CPS, dating back to 1949.

'I hope this conviction serves as an important message to people who have been the victim of crimes such as these that they should come forward regardless of when the offence occurred.'

Detective Inspector Tessa Philpott, of Scotland Yard’s Child Abuse Investigation Command, added: 'When Reginald Davies emigrated to Australia in 1974, he thought that he had left behind not only the UK, but also the horrendous catalogue of abuse he committed against four small children.

'I would imagine he thought his past would never catch up with him, and he would never face justice, but, thanks to the bravery of his victims, his past did catch up with him, and today he faces justice.

'I hope that this will go some way towards helping his victims, whose lives have been blighted by him, to move forward in some small way.

'I also hope that his extradition from the other side of the world and conviction give other victims the confidence to come forward and report their experiences to the police.'
