Billionaire American investor Josh Harris has opened exploratory talks with Crystal Palace over a potential purchase of the club.

Palace are one of a number of clubs that Harris is understood to be looking in to purchasing as he looks to expand his sports portfolio.

Harris - worth more than £1.25billion according to the Forbes guide - also owns NBA franchise the Philadelphia '76ers and National Hockey League side the New Jersey Devils.

He would become the fifth American owner of both an English football club and a U.S. franchise but will have to persuade the club's owners to sell.

Palace were rescued from administration by four supporters comprising the consortium 'CPFC 2010' four-and-a-half years ago.

Co-chairman Steve Parish has made it clear that he would welcome significant new investment providing it is right for Palace’s long-term future. 

Crystal Palace lost their last match 2-1 against Chelsea and are 16th in the Premier League 

'Josh obviously knows how to run pro sports franchises,' Sal Galatioto, who was involved in the deal to sell the 76ers to Harris, told Bloomberg.

'It’s a very interesting investment that should be a very good one for him over the long run. '

Harris would join John W Henry (Liverpool), the Glazer family (Manchester United), Stan Kroenke (Arsenal) and Shad Khan (Fulham) in owning clubs both sides of the Atlantic.

Aston Villa, another club Harris is thought to be considering purchasing, are also owned by an American (Randy Lerner), as are Sunderland (Ellis Short).

Palace won promotion to the Premier League in 2013 and finished 11th last season.

The South London club went into administration in 2010 before being promoted to the Premier League in 2013
