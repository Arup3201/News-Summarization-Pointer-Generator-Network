A former security guard at the largest political prison camp in North Korea has spoken out for the first time about the rape and murder of female inmates at the facility.

Mr Lee, a former security official at 
Camp 16 in the 1980s and 1990s, revealed the horror of daily life for prisoners at the site near Hwaseong in North Hamgyong province, which is approximately 215 square miles.

He broke his silence to tell Amnesty International, which is banned in the Communist country, about the methods used to execute prisoners incarcerated in the Soviet-style, hidden 'gulags'.

Now:
 Two satellite images of a village in the northern part of North Korean 
political camp 16 (Kwanliso). This one was take on 04 April 
2013. The photo below was taken 23 September 2011

Then:  The guard post in the immediate vicinity of the village allows 
for constant supervision of the prisoners and is indicative of the tight
 security within the political prison camp

Expanding: A satellite image from Kwanliso 16, taken on 26 May 2013. Close to the main entrance, shows two more housing units under construction, showing ten 4 x 3.5 metre units in each building

According to Mr Lee, 
women were killed after being brutally raped. 'After
 a night of "servicing" the officials, the women had to die because the 
secret could not get out. This happens at most of the political prison 
camps,' he said.

He also told how detainees were 
forced to dig their own graves and were then killed with hammer blows to
 their necks.

Mr Lee witnessed prison officers strangling detainees and
 then beating them to death with wooden sticks at the camp.

Today
 North Korea’s vast infrastructure of repression was exposed in new 
satellite images showing the development of two of the country’s largest
 political prison camps.

In
 a comprehensive mapping of camps, known as kwanliso, '15' and '16', 
Amnesty International found new housing blocks, an expansion of work 
facilities and tight security with perimeter fences and guard towers 
clearly visible. 

The latest images, taken in May, 
indicate a slight increase in kwanliso 16’s population, with newly-built
 housing blocks clearly visible - in 2011 it was 
estimated to have at least 20,000 people detained. 

Significant economic activity - such as
 mining, logging and agriculture - is clearly visible in the satellite 
images and there is an expansion of an industrial area within kwanliso 
16.

Forced hard labour is 
common in North Korea’s political prison camps which hold an estimated 130,000 prisoners. 

Two satellite images of the same central (administrative) area of Kwanliso 16 taken on May 18 2011 (below) and May 26 2013 (above).  The area appears to have undergone change in the observation time frame, including the razing and reconstruction of housing structures

The images show that instead of heeding the growing calls for closing its political prison camps, repression by the North Korean authorities has continued and the prisoner population appears to have slightly increased

Perimeter: Satellite image of Kwanliso 15, taken on 16 September 2013. The camp is surrounded by a double fence along its perimeter and numerous guard posts. Access is highly restricted through two gates on opposite sides of the political prison camp

Restricted: Movement appears to be restricted within the camps as this satellite image of political prison camp Kwanliso 16, shows a checkpoint on the main road

Testimony from former 
detainees and officials reveals how prisoners spend most of their time 
being forced to work in extremely dangerous conditions with inadequate 
food and very little sleep.

Hundreds of thousands of people, 
including children, are detained in political prison camps and other 
detention facilities in North Korea. 

Many have not committed any crime 
whatsoever but are merely family members of those deemed guilty.

They 
are detained as a form of collective punishment known officially in 
North Korea as 'guilt-by-association'.

The
 new images of Camp 15 - also known as 'Yodok'- show that 39 housing 
blocks have been demolished since Amnesty last assessed satellite 
pictures of the camp in 2011.

Women are routinely raped at the largest political prison camp in North Korea before 'disappearing', according to a former security official who used to work at one of the sites (left):  Kim Young-soon, a former detainee in Camp 15 between 1980 and 1989, described a public execution she witnessed of two detainees who were caught attempting to escape (right)

These images of prison camp 15 show a compound being built between March 2011 (left) and February 2012 (right). Amnesty said the function of the compound is unclear but is likely to be either a guard station or an administrative area to support logging activities

These satellite images of prison camp 15 show the changes in production activity. The first was taken in March, 2011, and the second was taken in September this year. Amnesty said these images and ones of prison camp 16 that instead of heeding the growing calls for closing its political prison camps, repression by the North Korean authorities has continued

Only six new housing blocks have been built in the camp which covers an area of 142 square miles, and is located in central North Korea around 45 miles from the capital Pyongyang.

In 2011, an estimated 50,000 people were imprisoned in the camp, with the population concentrated in river valleys.

As with kwanliso 16, security remains extremely tight in Yodok, and there is significant economic activity.

Kim
 Young-soon, a former detainee in Camp 15 between 1980 and 1989, 
described a public execution she witnessed of two detainees who were 
caught attempting to escape.

She explained how they were first 'half beaten to death' and then:  'They
 were brought to a stage after they were badly beaten. The prisoners 
were tied to wooden stakes and shot three times in their head, chest and
 feet.'

This satellite image of camp 16, taken on June 2010, shows building work at the facility. The camp has seen an increase in prisoner numbers, Amnesty said

This image of the same camp, taken in November 2012, shows a new operational industrial facility and new support buildings

These images of camp 15 taken in March 2011 (left) and September 2013 (right) show logging is heavily visible at the prison

Amnesty has shared the latest evidence with the UN Commission of Inquiry investigating human rights abuses in North Korea.

The report is entitled North Korea: Continued Investment in the Infrastructure of Repression and its author Amnesty International’s North Korea.

Researcher Rajiv Narayan, said: 'Under its new leader Kim Jong-un, North Korea is violating every conceivable human right.

'The camps are a gruesome and powerful tool at the heart of a vast network of repression.

'People
 are sent to the political prison camps without charge, let alone a 
trial, many of them simply for knowing someone who has fallen out of 
favour.'

Control: A picture released by the North Korean Central News Agency this week shows North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, touring an air force unit on the occasion of 'Aviation Day'. Amnesty says under Kim Jong-un, North Korea is 'violating every conceivable human right'
