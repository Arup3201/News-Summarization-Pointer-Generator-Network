Fashion fans on the front row were given more than they bargained for as models bared revealing new looks - including one pushing a pram without any trousers on.

It was part of underwear label Andres Sarda's catwalk show at Madrid Fashion Week today, where dozens of models took to the runway in a range of unusual outfits.

The collection featured designs that appeared to have parts missing, including half a houndstooth-design top and a collar and tie without an attached shirt, to reveal the lingerie.

Joining the models on the stage for the 61st Mercedes Benz fashion week was a dachshund and a group of young children.

Sarda, who founded the company in Barcelona in 1962, also brought Autumn-Winter 15/16 ranges with a strong focus on sportswear as well as transparent raincoats.

His luxury collections are known for pushing the boundaries in terms of design and fabric and are famed around the world.
