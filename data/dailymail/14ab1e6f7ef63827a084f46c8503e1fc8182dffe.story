A Boston bombing victim who got engaged last week to a nurse he met during his recovery says he is glad he got blown up - because it led him to his best friend.

James Costello, 31, who suffered serious burns in the blast, appeared on the Today show with his new fiancee, Krista D'Agostino, on Friday, just days after he proposed to her in France.

'I'm actually glad I got blown up,' he told Savannah Guthrie. 'I wish everyone else didn't have to. But I never would have met her. I'm pretty happy.'

The
 heartwarming news comes eight months after Costello headed to the 
marathon finish line with five childhood friends. The bombs exploded 
nearby, killing three and injuring more than 270.

Happy: James Costello, who suffered serious burns in the Boston bombings, appeared on the Today show with his new fiance Krista D'Agostino, a nurse he met in rehab. The couple got engaged last week

Relevation: He told Savannah Guthrie he understood why he had been hurt - to meet D'Agostino

Costello, from Malden, Massachusetts,
 was famously pictured looking dazed walking through the debris-strewn 
streets with his clothes torn to shreds by the blasts.

His right arm and right leg suffered such serious burns that he needed pig skin grafts.

'April 15 was one of the worst days of
 my life,' Costello, known as 'Bim' to his friends, wrote in a Facebook post after the engagement. 'I soon
 wondered why and for what reason this had happened.'

But
 from the pain he found joy. After undergoing multiple surgeries at 
Massachusetts General Hospital, he was moved to Spaulding Rehabilitation
 Hospital - where he first saw Krista D'Agostino.

'A few days later I saw a nurse in 
passing, this would turn out to be Krista, who had shared a few mutual 
friends, but we had never crossed paths before,' he wrote.

'After 
sharing a handful of conversations I realized not only how beautiful she
 was but also what a kind heart she had. I somehow convinced her to 
attend a benefit with me, which turned into a few dates, which turned 
into a few inseparable months.'

Joy: D'Agostino reveals her engagement ring in Lyon, France, where Costello popped the question

On the Today show, D'Agostino said she first noticed him for 'that smile'.

'It was kind of on to the next one - different fundraisers or events we went to together. That was it!' she said of their relationship.

The couple recently went on a 10-day trip to Europe with other victims and first responders, and while in Lyon, France, Costello popped the question.

'I'm
 happy to announce that we will spend the rest of our lives together,' he wrote on Facebook. 'I 
now realized why I was involved in the tragedy. It was to meet my best 
friend, and the love of my life.'

In
 a Facebook photo, D'Agostino showed off her engagement ring, with 
Lyon's carousel in the background. Hundreds of friends shared their 
congratulations with the couple.

His friends also suffered life-changing 
injuries, with three of the men, including brothers Paul and J.P. 
Norden, each losing a leg.

Injuries: He suffered serious burns to his right leg and right arm and needed pig skin grafts to heal

Another friend, Marc Fucarile, became the 
last victim to leave the hospital after 100 days of treatment for broken
 bones and a piece of shrapnel lodged near his heart.

Mike Jefferson, the school buddy they came to cheer on at the marathon, was the only one spared.

The
 men, who met at elementary school or youth clubs in the small 
Massachusetts town of Stoneham, grew up at each others' houses.

As
 for Costello, he worked through rehabilitation, undergoing daily 
physical therapy to strengthen his weakened leg muscles. Metal shavings 
of bomb debris continue to work their way out of skin on his right arm.
