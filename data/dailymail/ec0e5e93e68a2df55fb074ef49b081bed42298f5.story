The family home of a 14-year-old Islamic State supporter who threatened to kill Christians as he drove past a school was targeted in Australia’s biggest-ever counter terror raids just two days later.

The Sydney boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, drove by the Maronite College of the Holy Family in Harris Park, in the city’s west, on September 16 waving the Islamic State flag.

He pleaded guilty in Parramatta Children's Court on Monday to shouting death threats at students and one teacher.

Now the Sydney Morning Herald has revealed his home was raided on September 18 as part of a federal investigation to foil an alleged kidnapping and public execution plot.

A random Australian was alleged to be the target of the plot that was designed to shock the community.

Over 800 heavily armed officers raided households in Sydney and Brisbane and the 14-year-old’s home was one of those searched for Islamic State propaganda.

Nobody in his family was charged during the raid. The following week the boy was charged with intimidating behaviour and offensive conduct after the school drive-by incident.

Police arrested the boy at his home.

Joseph Wakim, speaking on behalf of the Maronite school at the time, said news of the arrest would give parents and students a peace of mind during the school holidays.

'My daughter was very concerned that an overseas group making front page news every day could be at the front door of her school,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'The fact the teenager was a passenger in a vehicle is a metaphor for a larger issue. A lot of these people are being driven and being steered and they need someone to say wrong way and go back.' 

Mr Wakim, who is the founder of the Australian Arabic Council, said the school commended police for their presence outside the school in the days following the incident.

Witnesses to the September 16 incident reported seeing someone waving the Islamic State flag from the car and yelling out: 'We're going to kill all you Christians.'

School principal Sister Margaret Ghosn told Daily Mail Australia the school had taken the threat seriously and had requested security from police.

At the time of the incident, she said young people drove past the College twice and made 'silly noises'.

The parish priest of Our Lady of Lebanon Church,  Mons Shora Maree, issued a statement after the incident.

'On Tuesday afternoon there was a single incident were by a verbal threat was made by a single passing motorist to a MCHF College staff members.

'The incident was reported to police who swiftly attended.

'This is now in the hands of police who are fully investigating. Please do not respond to or circulate any other version of the truth on social media as it creates unnecessary panic.'

The 14-year-old will be sentenced later this year.
