Paintings by Stone Roses guitarist John Squire have been destroyed in a fire which burned his art studio to the ground.

The blaze broke out at Mr Squire's home in Macclesfield, Cheshire, where he had a purpose-built studio which he used to create his popular Squire's Celebrity series.

Paintings of Harry Houdini and serial killer Aileen Wournos were lost in Wednesday's inferno.

Stone Roses guitarist John Squire says he is 'extremely sad' at losing his paintings and art studio in a blaze at his home in Macclesfield, Cheshire

Mr Squire's agent, Vivienne Gaskin, said the performer was 'extremely sad' over the losses but grateful no one was hurt.

'It could have been much much worse,' said Ms Gaskin. 'He has got about four of the paintings from the collection in his home and the others have been sold.

'The studio was built near his home so his family were his main priority but they are all fine.'

The fire brigade are investigating the cause of the blaze but believe it was an accident

She added: “Knowing they are safe, he is obviously extremely sad that these paintings have gone and he will now have to completely re-build the studio.'

Police are not treating the blaze as suspicious.

Mancunian Mr Squire’s Celebrity series gained many admirers for his abstract style and broad range of subjects.

The Stone Roses were one of the biggest bands of the 1980s and 1990s and one of the pioneering rock bands of the 'Madchester movement', featuring groups like the Happy Mondays and The Charlatans.

After disbanding in the 1990s, they delighted fans earlier this year when announcing a reunion and world tour.

The news sent fans into a frenzy and tickets to their three reunion gigs at Heaton Park sold out in 14 minutes.

Led by singer Ian Brown, they have so far released two albums, The Stone Roses and Second Coming, and say they plan to release a third soon.

There were representations of another serial killer, Harold Shipman, and Austrian monster Josef Fritzl, who held his daughter captive for 24 years, while film director Woody Allen, footballer David Beckham and Hollywood actress Lindsay Lohan also featured.

Mr Squire's artwork has also adorned the singles, album covers and promotional posters for his and the Stone Roses' music.

Other examples of his work include a surfboard covered with Beach Boys song titles, while he has held well received exhibitions at The Smithfield Gallery in London and abroad in Austria and Tokyo.

After the Stone Roses broke up in 1996, Mr Squire formed The Seahorses, who released one album before splitting. He also made two solo albums.

In 2007 he said he was giving up music for good to focus on his painting career but rejoined the Stone Roses this year.
