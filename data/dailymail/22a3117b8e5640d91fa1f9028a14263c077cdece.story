A new video shows LA police officers dragging a homeless man from his tent just moments before they shot him dead in a street confrontation on the city's Skid Row.

This latest video shows the man - who is thought to have been called Booth, but is known locally as 'Africa' and 'Cameroon' in reference to his African heritage - disappearing into his tent after apparently speaking to police. 

But officers swoop down on the man and drag him from his tent, which appears to collapse. 

A violent altercation ensues before five officers manage to pin him down - and then three officers open fire, killing the man.

The CCTV, shot from the local homeless shelter, has shed yet more light on the violent midday confrontation which has left many shocked after an initial video appeared on social media on Sunday.  

Conversation: The homeless shelter's CCTV footage shows the man apparently talk to officers

Hiding?: The man then gets into his tent - but the officers appear to be trying to get him out

Increase: More officers arrive and begin to try to drag the man - who was known as 'Africa' - from the tent

Shot dead: A violent altercation ensued and the homeless man, circled in red, was gunned down by officers

The first footage released of the incident showed the man flailing at officers before being pinned to the floor. They try to use a Taser on him - but it seemingly has no effect.

Shouts of 'Drop the gun! Drop the gun!' can be heard seconds before three officers open fire on the prone man. 

Outraged crowds soon gathered at the scene, accusing the police of unjustly killing him. 

Witnesses have characterised the police response as overly aggressive, and say they should have been able to restrain a mentally-ill homeless man with non-lethal means.

Pressure for the LAPD to produce evidence to vindicate their officers has been mounting ever since the video was released.

A police statement on the killing said that 'the suspect and officers struggled over one of the officer's handguns' before shots were fired - a statement the LAPD say is backed up by onlooker footage. 

But officials claim a frame from an onlooker's video shows the man grabbing at an officer's waistband,  while a close-up of the weapon in question apparently shows damage caused by the scuffle.

LAPD officials say the man was wanted in connection with a robbery, and started brawling with officers who approached him.

Fight: The CCTV then captures the altercation which ended in the man's death at the hands of officers

Police chief Charlie Beck has called Sunday's killing an 'extreme tragedy' - and implored anybody with video evidence to submit it to police.

He has also revealed two of the officers were wearing body-mounted cameras.

His statement came as more information emerged about the drifter, whom friends say came from Cameroon and lived in the U.S. for a decade before coming to LA six months ago.

Referring to him as 'Booth', 'Cameroon' or 'Africa' - references to his home country - fellow Skid Row vagrants say he lived in a tent on the streets and often read the Bible.

MailOnline spoke with a close friend of Africa on Monday, who said the man moved to LA sixth months ago, and had a combination of mental illness and drug addiction problems.

Nick ‘KB’ Gee said the man’s real first name is Booth, but people called him ‘Africa’ because he was originally from Cameroon.

‘Booth was trying to get back home to Africa but he didn’t have no money, that’s why he was homeless,’ Gee said.

‘‘I talked to him a lot of days, he was a very respectful, honest man. He didn’t bother nobody, he would sit in his tent reading his Bible.

‘He told me about his family and he said he had to go back home to take care of some things.’

‘He don’t have nobody out here so I would come down and help him out, get him food, some money, a cigarette,’ he said.

Killing: This is the moment police fired shots at the homeless man, who is obscured from view in the above frame by an officer. The LAPD have claimed he was trying to take an officer's gun

Fight: At the beginning of the encounter, the man is seen taking swings at several police officers on Skid Row

Confronted: He was being confronted over reports of a robbery before five shots were fired

Nick said police had responded not because of a robbery but because Booth was arguing with a neighbor who lived in a tent next to his.

‘A lot of guys who know him would have helped calm him down, the police know the man, they talk to him everyday, ask him to take his tent down,’ he said.

‘You’re dealing with a guy with a combination of mental illness and drug addiction, they used over excessive force.

‘They Tasered him and he was scared and tried to run in to the tent, they dragged him out and instead of five cops holding him down they shot him.’

One homeless man who identified by his nickname ‘Juju’ said he was friends with Africa, whom he said he last saw no more than 30 minutes before the shooting.

He told the LA Times that he was also was also known as ‘Cameroon,’ for his home country. Juju said they had been chatting about politics the last time they spoke.

‘They did not have to kill my friend,’ Juju said.

He said his fellow homeless friend’s problems with police were nothing new.

There were arguments most days between Africa and LAPD officers over taking down his tent, Juju said.

‘He would say, “Ticket me. Give me my day in court,”’ he said.

But despite his run-ins with the law, Juju said Africa was a generally peaceful man.

‘He was generous,’ he told the LA Times. ‘He lived in a tent, but he was content.’ 

The LAPD has its own investigation into the killing, which will 'determine whether the use of deadly force was consistent with Department policies and procedures'.

LA County's district attorney's office will also conduct its own probe.

Last night, LAPD spokesman Andy Smith insisted that the shots only came after the struggle over a firearm.

He told reporters: 'During the attempt to detain him, this individual resisted our officers. Theys struggled with him, they tried to tase him a couple of times.' 

'That was ineffective and eventually the struggle occurred where the officers that were struggling with the individual over one of the officer's weapons.

Police have not formally identified the man they killed. A spokesman told DailyMail.com that no more information would be released Monday, and that any body cam footage would be held back until after the LAPD's own investigation was over.

Shooting: The attack took place in the Skid Row district of Los Angeles, which is known for its large homeless population
