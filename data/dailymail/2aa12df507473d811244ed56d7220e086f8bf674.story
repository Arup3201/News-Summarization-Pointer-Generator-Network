After years of photographing and telling the stories of some of New York's longest abandoned sites, a photographer has put his photographs, research, and experiences into a book.

For the last three years, photographer Will Ellis has traveled around the five boroughs of New York City 'obsessively exploring' the city's abandoned places and taking photographs along the way, according to his blog Abandoned NYC.

And now,the Brooklyn-based photographer and videographer has published his findings in a book, 'Abandoned NYC.' 

'I made it a goal pretty quickly to do a book soon after starting the blog; it was always part of the plan,' Ellis told Untapped Cities.

Since he began the blog in 2012, Ellis has photographed dozens of abandoned places from castles and cemeteries to mental institutions and diners. 

The book includes 200 eerie images of 'urban decay,' according to Amazon, and Ellis said he spent a lot of time doing research on the locations he photographed.

'It's one thing to write up an article for the internet, but having it in print meant there was a lot of pressure to get things right,' Ellis told Untapped.

He said the book has been in the works for the last two years and he is excited to 'finally get it into people's hands.'
