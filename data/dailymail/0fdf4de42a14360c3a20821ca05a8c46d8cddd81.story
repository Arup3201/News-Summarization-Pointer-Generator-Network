PR guru Max Clifford today claimed that the Jimmy Savile scandal is the only reason he is on trial for historical sex offences.

Speaking outside court on the day he pleaded not guilty to 11 counts of indecent assault, the 70-year-old said he was under a 'black cloud' and added that he should not be on trial at all.

He appeared at Southwark Crown Court for a plea hearing this morning, and was told to return on March 4 to stand trial.

Hearing: Max Clifford today pleaded not guilty to 11 counts of sexual assault

Speaking out: Clifford told reporters outside court that he was 'totally innocent' of the charges

The publicist is accused of assaulting seven teenagers from 1966 to 1985, charges which he vigorously denies.

When
reporters asked if he had ever expected to stand trial over the 
allegations, he replied: 'Of course I didn't. But for Jimmy Savile I 
wouldn't be here.'

The 
publicist was originally arrested by police working on Operation 
Yewtree, the investigation set up in the wake of the Savile scandal, 
although the allegations against him are not connected to the disgraced 
TV presenter.

Clifford, the most high-profile PR operative in Britain, was arrested last December and was charged in April.

Defendant: Clifford's trial on the 11 sexual assault chargesis set to begin on March 4

As he arrived at court in London, he told reporters: 'I'm OK. Obviously I am totally innocent of these charges.

'It's been a very hard time for myself, my wife, my family, loved ones.

'I have been helped tremendously by the public support, everywhere I go. That obviously has made a huge difference.

'You have to get on with life as much as you can but this has been a black cloud hanging over me.'

Clifford, from Hersham in Surrey, has been charged with 11 offences dating between 1966 and 1985.

Crowd: Dozens of reporters were gathered outside to the court as Clifford made a statement

The
PR legend, famed for representing celebrities including Simon Cowell 
and Jade Goody, spoke only to confirm his name and to enter not-guilty 
pleas to the charges during the 40-minute hearing.

He was released on bail until his trial next March.

Judge
Anthony Leonard told Clifford, wearing a grey jacket and white, 
open-neck shirt, that he is not allowed to contact prosecution 
witnesses.

Outside court after the hearing, Clifford said: 'The nightmare continues, it has done since last December.

'I
want to thank everyone for their support, in this country and abroad. 
It is a nightmare for myself and everyone close to me. I am totally 
innocent.

'Next March, as long as the truth comes out, it will be fine and I can get back to a normal life.'
