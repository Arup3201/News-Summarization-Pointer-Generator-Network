Being greeted with a litany of abuse on a first date isn't usually a recipe for romance but when Brent Zillwood called Challis Orme a 's***head' while they sat at the bar she wasn't deterred.

Model Challis, 26, and Brent, 23, who has Tourette's Syndrome, were watched by millions as they met in an Exeter pub on the Channel 4 show, The Undateables. 

And a year on, the couple, who live in Hertfordshire, have tied the knot in a dream Las Vegas ceremony - and become the first pair to marry from the programme about people with disabilities attempting to find love.

Brent Zillwood and Challis Orme married before Christmas a year after meeting on TV's The Undateables

Challis, from Teignmouth, Devon, knew about Brent's condition when they met and was too concerned about the butterflies in her stomach to worry about his disorder, which makes him swear and twitch uncontrollably.

Millions watched Brent's search for a soulmate including a romance with a 19-year-old barmaid which fizzled out. 

Not only was Challis unfazed by the filmmaker's condition, she actually helps keep it under control.

He told the Sunday Mirror: 'If I did twitch she just laughed.' he said.

She said: 'I didn't know much about it and it was a bit shocking at first but once he explained it to me I realised there was nothing he could do about it,' she says.

'But I fancied him straight away and I've never been self-conscious about it. I love him for lots of reasons.'

Brent and Challis first met in front of TV cameras in an Exeter pub where six months later he proposed

After six months together, Brent, from Plymouth, took her back to the pub where they met and proposed with a platinum and amethyst crystal ring and a scrapbook of their relationship together.

On the last page he'd written, 'What happens next depends on how you answer my next question.'

He then proposed and Challis immediately said yes.

The couple married in Las Vegas before Christmas, and spent five days in the Nevada city.

Brent said his Tourette's was well behaved except when he picked up their marriage license. But before the ceremony itself, he gave himself 'a talking to' and made it through the ceremony without incident. 

While starting a family is on the cards, for now they want to start working with children with Tourette's to show that it needn't rule your life.

Brent said: 'I'm the happiest I've ever been and I want to share that.'
