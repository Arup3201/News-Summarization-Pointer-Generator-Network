Underestimated? Drinking up to six pints a day is OK for your health, a leading alcohol scientist has claimed

Limits: A pint of beer contains around two units. Men are currently meant to have no more than four units a day, and women three

He believes believes drinking only becomes harmful when people consume more than around 13 units a day.

Men are currently meant to have no more than four units a day but women are supposed to have three units.

This equates to 21 units for men and 14 for women. A pint of beer contains around two units.

Dr Poikolainen also claimed that people who exceed the recommended limit could live longer than teetotallers.

The Finnish scientist said: 'The weight of the 
evidence shows moderate drinking is better than abstaining and heavy 
drinking is worse than abstaining – however the moderate amounts can be 
higher than the guidelines say.’

Bottoms up: Dr Poikolainen also claims that a bottle of wine a day is not harmful for health

He added that drinking just over a bottle of wine a day won’t harm health, either. A bottle contains 10 units. 

But
 Julia Manning, from think-tank 2020Health, said: ‘This is an unhelpful 
contribution to the debate. It makes grand claims which we don’t see 
evidence for.’ She added: ‘Alcohol is a toxin, the risks outweigh the 
benefits.’
