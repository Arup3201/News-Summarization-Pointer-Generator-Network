A child sex abuse victim was arrested and locked up overnight in a police cell to make sure she gave evidence against her attacker.

The vulnerable 15-year-old was detained for 20 hours to guarantee she testified against the 32-year-old man who had abused her.

Judge Robert Bartfield gave  permission for the extraordinary decision, which has been condemned by child welfare groups as ‘Dickensian’.

Jailed: Abid Miskeen has been sentenced to seven years in prison for impregnating a teenager

Yesterday the judge defended his 
actions, insisting that the girl’s detention was essential for ‘the 
interests of justice’ because ‘without her attendance, the trial would 
have collapsed.’

The girl, 
who lives in a children’s home and cannot be named for legal reasons, 
was groomed for eight months by Abid Miskeen. She got pregnant aged 14 
in June last year and had an abortion.

She
 was reluctant to testify against Miskeen as she still ‘harboured strong
 feelings’ for him. Despite this reticence, she arrived at Bradford 
Crown Court at 10am on Wednesday last week to give evidence.

Controversy: Judge Robert Barfield ordered the victim to be held in a police cell overnight

However, 
she was kept waiting for more than five hours as the judge was busy with
 another trial so, bored and frustrated, she left.

Prosecutors
 then applied to the judge to approve an arrest  warrant and she was 
picked up by West Yorkshire Police, taken to  Halifax police station and
 kept in a cell overnight.

She
 was brought back to court by police the next morning and kept in a 
holding cell until the trial finally started at almost 4pm.

When she finally gave evidence, it lasted just 22 minutes.

Yesterday,
 Miskeen was sentenced to seven years in prison for sexual activity with
 a child. The father-of-two was also placed on the sex offenders’ 
register for life. A jury had taken less than two hours to return a 
unanimous guilty verdict on Tuesday.

On
 jailing him, Judge Bartfield defended his decision and said: ‘Those who
 decry the process that has taken place in this case should be careful 
what they wish for.’

He added that had the girl not been present to give evidence, Miskeen would have walked free from court.

However, victims’ charities have spoken out against the girl’s ‘utterly shameful’ treatment.

Adam
 Pemberton of Victim Support said: ‘It is utterly shameful that any 
vulnerable witness, let alone a child who has been the victim of 
sustained sexual exploitation, could be treated in such a grotesque and 
degrading manner by those who were supposed to protect her.

The 
spectacle of a child spending the hours before she gives evidence 
against her abuser locked up in cells is nothing short  of Dickensian.’

Peter
 Wanless, chief executive of the NSPCC, added: ‘This is a truly shocking
 case. All elements of the justice system failed this girl. 

‘She
 was left waiting to give her evidence by the court and then the CPS and
 police sought an unnecessarily harsh response to her leaving, and sadly
 the judge granted this without considering what she had endured.’

Guidance
 for judges and the Crown Prosecution Service warns that children should
 not be kept waiting at courts, which can be ‘daunting and stressful for
 children’. Furthermore, they must not be caused ‘unnecessary worry and 
distress.’

Yesterday, Judge
 Bartfield attempted to explain his decision, saying: ‘The suggestion 
that she was in some way forced into the witness box by the prosecution 
to give  evidence is wholly misconceived.

‘For better or worse that’s the way our system works.’

However,
 Laura Hoyano, an associate professor of Law at the University of Oxford
 and co-author of a book on child-abuse law and policy, described the 
case as being ‘completely mishandled’.

She added: ‘When it became clear there was going to be a long delay, they should have sent her home.’

A
 spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service said the ‘exceptional step’
 to ask for a warrant was taken after ‘all other options were explored 
and exhausted’ .
