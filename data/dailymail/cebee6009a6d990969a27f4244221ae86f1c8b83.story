Welcome to your future kingdom, Your Royal Highness. Welcome to the world. It won’t always be quite like this. But it’s safe to say that you are very, very welcome.

At 7.13pm, the doors of the Lindo Wing of St Mary’s Hospital, Paddington, swung open to reveal the sight which opens another chapter in our extraordinary royal story.

Held tight in the arms of his (astonishingly poised) mother, our next King but two made his public debut – and first royal wave – in front of a live global audience of many hundreds of millions.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Let me have a go: William tentatively reaches for the baby

So... how do we do this? The Duke ponders the mechanics

Let the handover begin: Kate leans in, but keeps a firm hold

Easy does it: She slowly lowers the baby towards his father with William appearing tense as he finally takes over

It is hard to recall a royal appearance more keenly awaited than this one. Even that post-wedding balcony kiss couldn’t quite trump the moment. In more than 20 years of covering royal events, I can’t remember a scene quite so full of raw, impromptu joy.

With scenes of delirious chaos all around, this well-wrapped bundle of love, hope and a nation’s expectations was then transferred into the arms of his father. Like any new dad, it was an anxious moment before the handover was safely completed.

The Duke of Cambridge could scarcely keep his eyes off his son and heir. This most private of men had no qualms in admitting that the whole thing had been ‘very emotional – very special’. He told us: ‘Well, he’s got a good pair of lungs on him, that’s for sure. He’s a big boy, he’s quite heavy.’

‘It’s very emotional and such a special time,’ the Duchess, chimed in, as fresh as her floaty blue dress.

‘I think any parent will probably know what this feeling feels like.’ Considering the magnitude of the moment, it is safe to say that these two will be a safe pair of hands in a national crisis.

‘He’s got her looks, thankfully,’ joked the Duke. ‘No, no, no,’ she bounced back. ‘I’m not sure about that.’ Have a look at those scenes again (you won’t have much choice over the next few days). Note the way that the Duchess looks at her husband even more than at her baby; she is manifestly just as proud of him as of her little boy. ‘He’s done the first nappy already,’ she told us.

No name yet, of course, but more self-deprecating humour. Asked about the baby’s hair, the Duke reflected: ‘He’s got way more than me, thank God.’

Oh, I've got him! The anxious expression dissolves into delight

Family unit: The Duchess looks on as William concentrates

Check him out! She appears proud of her husband's efforts

Look of love: William cannot hide the emotion on his face as the doting dad finally begins to relax

And with that, they briefly retired indoors for what is usually a fractious rite of passage: attaching the child to the car seat. Had the Duke been in training? Without so much as a cross word, let alone a fumble with the instruction book, he slotted our newest HRH into the back seat with a slickness that will infuriate new fathers everywhere.

They say that a baby crocodile regards the first thing it sees as its mother.

Let’s hope the same does not apply to monarchs and their subjects. Poor Prince X’s first glimpse of his people was not a pretty one – several hundred frazzled, sunburned, rain-soaked cameramen.

There, hospital staff of every rank and responsibility had been given plum positions either side of the doors. They couldn’t decide whether to clap or film the moment on their mobile phones.

Many did both, cheering at the same time. Here was a complete cross-section of hospital life, a happy jumble of name badges – ‘nursery nurse’, ‘works administrator’, ‘sister’.

Special moment: Prince William and Kate waved and smiled broadly as they carried their son out of hospital, but they are yet to decide on a name

New life: The baby was crying in his car seat as his father took him to their waiting car yesterday evening

Magic: With the world watching, Kate and William hold their prince outside the Lindo Wing in a genuinely historic moment for Britain

Emotional: The new mother looked delighted as she looked down at her first child while her husband waved to the excited crowds

Protective: The baby was wrapped in a white shawl - Kate held her new son closely to her chest as she waved to the impressive crowd

The safe hands of the Duchess of Cambridge with her son who was born on Monday, but was thrown into the spotlight yesterday

Craning over a  railing, another revealed herself to  be ‘bookings co-ordinator’.

She must have been busy lately. The 
world has seen the media circus on the outside. These staff have 
experienced this happy – and good-natured – siege from within. All were,
understandably, tight-lipped on details afterwards. But they were 
delighted to reflect on their moment of collective glory.

‘I can’t begin to say what I feel – 
just over the moon,’ said Mary Grafton, business manager of the Lindo 
Wing. Alongside her stood Marielle Bouqueau, a young midwife almost 
speechless in the excitement of the moment.

These are people who see the
extremes of human emotion every day. Even they could not quite take it 
all in.

Up on high, every floor of the Queen 
Mother building had faces squashed against the glass. On the fourth 
floor, I counted ten staff togged up in blue surgical scrubs – hats and 
all. One hoped that all had finished their work for the day.

Although
Palace aides were suggesting that Baby Cambridge might spend yet 
another night in hospital, several clues suggested otherwise. By 
mid-afternoon, we spotted a tell-tale sign: the arrival of both the car 
seat and Amanda Cook Tucker.

The Duchess had been safely delivered of 
her hairdresser. Next came the first pair of grandparents – in a London 
cab. The Middletons have seen a few media circuses in recent years but 
the scale of this one seemed to take them aback.

Are those tears? The Duchess admitted the becoming a mother for the first time was 'emotional'

William calmly carried his new baby to the Range Rover which he drove home himself with his wife and child on board

Welcome to the world: The baby, titled His Royal Highness, Prince (name) of Cambridge, raised his tiny hands in the air as he was transported to the awaiting car in the car seat

Precious cargo: Prince William carefully placed his new son in the back seat of the awaiting car in preparation for their journey back to Kensington Palace

Goodbye: William gives a final farewell wave before he drives his wife and their new addition back home

An
hour later, Michael and Carole Middleton emerged exuding the giddy 
contentment of two people who cannot quite believe they have just met 
their first grandchild. By the time the Prince of Wales arrived with the
Duchess of Cornwall soon afterwards, the cheering had turned to faintly
manic screaming.

Gaskets were blowing. If this baby did not appear soon, some people were going to be ending up in the A&E block next door.

And
finally, the world’s most glamorous young couple and their new Crown 
jewel breezed out to face the world and one of those fluffy television 
microphones, which was sprouting from the middle of the road.

Here
was a vivid reminder of the difference between what the great 
constitutionalist, Walter Bagehot, described as the ‘dignified’ and 
‘efficient’ parts of the British constitution.

These three young people 
will never govern us like our elected leaders. But they will represent 
us at home and abroad; they will be the focus of attention in times of 
trouble and great happiness.

If
Monarchy stands for anything, it is for continuity in a changing world.
Could anything possibly illustrate this more clearly than these 
euphoric scenes in a Paddington side road yesterday evening?

Poking fun: Camilla smiles broadly as Prince 
Charles asks journalists outside St Mary's Hospital: 'Have you been 
there long?' before heading up the steps to meet his first grandchild

Exit: After an hour in the Lindo Wing at St Mary's Hospital, Carole and Michael Middleton leave after seeing their grandson for the first time

Few words: Carole spoke on behalf of her and Michael, and said the baby was 'absolutely beautiful' and that William and Kate were coping 'fabulously'

Thrilled: Kate's parents Carole and Michael smiled broadly as they arrived at hospital to see their daughter and meet their new grandchild
