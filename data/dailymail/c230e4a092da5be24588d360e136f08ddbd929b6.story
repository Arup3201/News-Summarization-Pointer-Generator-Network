A U.S. judge sentenced the girlfriend of reputed mob boss James 'Whitey' Bulger to eight years in prison on Tuesday for her role in helping him evade arrest for 16 years.

District Judge Douglas Woodlock also imposed on Catherine Greig a $150,000 fine and ordered her to serve three years of supervised release once she is out of prison.

Rather than face trial Greig, 61, pleaded guilty in March to charges of conspiracy to harbor a fugitive, conspiracy to commit identity fraud, and identity fraud. Prosecutors had sought 10 years in prison while her attorney had recommended 27 months.

Woodlock told Greig that she had to take responsibility for her own choices made over the many years that Bulger was on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list.

'We are all responsible for what we do ... we all make choices,' Woodlock said.

Greig, in blue prison jumpsuit, briefly nodded at her twin sister, Margaret McCusker, before being led out of the packed courtroom in downtown Boston. Outside the courtroom, McCusker said merely that she 'loves her sister.'

She showed no emotion when Woodlock handed down the sentence after listening to emotional pleas from relatives of those Bulger is accused of killing. Bulger, the 82-year-old former leader of the notorious Winter Hill Gang.

Earlier, Woodlock had indicated he was leaning toward a comparatively long sentence for Greig because of her active role in helping Bulger, who is accused of 19 murders from the 1970s and 1980s, hide from authorities

'The defendant was involved in more than merely providing shelter to Mr. Bulger, she provided a variety of things, and engaged in criminal activity,' Woodlock said.

Greig and Bulger, 82, were arrested on June 22, 2011, in an apartment hideout in Santa Monica, California, blocks from the Pacific Ocean, where they had lived under a number of fake and stolen identities for most of their years on the run.

A cache of some 30 weapons as well as more than $800,000 in cash was hidden in a hole in the wall. Much of the pre-sentencing debate centered on Greig's knowledge of, and access, to, the guns.

Greig's lawyer, Kevin Reddington, urged the judge to impose a sentence of a little over two years, arguing that Greig was in love with Bulger when she fled Boston with him in 1995.

'Catherine Greig fell in love with Mr. Bulger, and that's why she was in the situation she was in,' Reddington said. 'Miss Greig did not believe that Mr. Bulger was capable of these homicides.'

But prosecutors dismissed her professions of love and said Greig had numerous opportunities to leave Bulger during their time on the run.

'This was not a romantic saga,' U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz said. 'She helped and protected and concealed a fugitive.'

Before sentencing, the court heard emotional testimony from the families of some of Bulger's alleged victims.

'She was not held against her will 
... She was a willing supporter and co-conspirator of Whitey Bulger,' 
said Steve Davis, whose 26-year-old sister, Debra, was one of Bulger's 
alleged victims. 'She doesn't even have the heart to look any of us in 
the eye.'

Tim
Connors, whose father Edward was allegedly shot by Bulger in 1975, said
Greig was 'a cold-hearted criminal (who) never showed any sympathy 
toward any of us.'

'You're as much a criminal as Whitey and should be treated as such,' he said.

Patricia Donahue, the widow of Michael Donahue, a truck driver who prosecutors say was killed by Bulger in 1982, said she believes Greig is responsible for Bulger being able to remain a fugitive for so long.

'I believe he never would have survived all those years without her help,' she said.

Greig did not flinch at their words, and did not turn to look at the families. She also declined to address the court.

Greig's
lawyer had appealed for leniency, asking the judge to give her 27 
months in prison. After the sentencing, Reddington told reporters that 
Greig has no regrets about what she did.

'He's the love of her life and she stands by him ... of course she doesn't regret it,' Reddington said.

Greig, a former dental hygienist and dog groomer, faced a maximum of 15 years - five years on each of the three charges.

She had been with Bulger for more 
than three decades, first as a secret girlfriend he kept on the side 
while he lived with another woman, then as the faithful woman who left 
behind her life in Massachusetts so she could go on the run with him.

Greig's plea deal with prosecutors doesn't require her to cooperate in the case against Bulger. After she was sentenced, Ortiz said prosecutors aren't trying to compel her to testify against him.

'That's not something we're seeking,' Ortiz said. 'We indicted and we're ready to prosecute without her help.'

In her plea agreement, Greig admitted that she used aliases, unlawfully obtained identification documents and repeatedly helped Bulger get prescription medication from a pharmacy by pretending to be his wife.

Greig and Bulger traveled extensively during their first year on the run - to Chicago, New York City, Grand Isle, La., and other places - but then settled in a two-bedroom rented apartment in Santa Monica.

Last June, Bulger and Greig were apprehended just days after the FBI began a new publicity campaign focusing on Greig.

Bulger has pleaded not guilty to charges linked to 19 murders in the 1970s and 1980s, when prosecutors say he ran the mostly Irish-American gang.

The accused mob boss fled Boston in 1994 after getting a tip from a corrupt FBI agent that authorities were closing in on him. Greig joined Bulger a few weeks later.

Bulger's trial is scheduled to start on November 5 although his lawyers have said they need more time to sift through hundreds of thousands of pages of evidence.

Bulger's case inspired Martin Scorsese's 2006 Academy Award-winning film 'The Departed.'
