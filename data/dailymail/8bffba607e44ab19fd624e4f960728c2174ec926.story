Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond finally resigned as Scottish First Minister today - but will not be replaced until after cheering on Scotland  against the English in tonight's crunch football match in Glasgow.

Mr Salmond officially stood down in a statement to Holyrood this afternoon, paving the way for new SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon to take over tomorrow.

In his last engagement as First Minister, Mr Salmond will attend tonight's clash with the Auld Enemy at Celtic's Parkhead stadium in Glasgow.

Alex Salmond delivered his formal resignation statement as First Minister of Scotland in Holyrood today

After standing down he embraced his replacement Nicola Sturgeon, who will take up her position tomorrow

During a statement at the Scottish Parliament, Mr Salmond said it had been ‘the privilege of his life’ to serve in the role for the past seven-and-a-half years.

Mr Salmond received a standing ovation from MSPs after delivering his final words, before being embraced by Ms Sturgeon.

He said: ‘Any parting is tinged with some sorrow, but in this case it is vastly outweighed by a sense of optimism and confidence. Confidence that we will have an outstanding new First Minister.

‘Confidence in the standing and the capability of this chamber, and most of all confidence in the wisdom, talent and potential of the people of Scotland.’

In his final words to the chamber as First Minister he said: ‘Can I wish every member of this Parliament well, and wish everyone goodbye and good luck.’

He will remain in post until the start of Holyrood's business tomorrow afternoon, attending his final engagement as First Minister at the Scotland v England football match this evening.

It comes after a new survey put support for the SNP  at 45.8 per cent, compared with just 23.9 per cent for Labour. It is the highest ever lead recorded by the pollsters Survation.

The poll for the Daily Record will pile pressure on Labour leader Ed Miliband – after finding just 2 per cent of Scottish voters completely trust Mr Miliband.

The SNP’s Westminster leader Angus Robertson said: ‘This new opinion poll giving the SNP our biggest ever lead in a Survation poll for both Holyrood and Westminster elections is enormously encouraging.

‘It reflects all recent surveys in underlining the strength of the SNP vote, and is a further demonstration that Labour and the other Westminster parties are facing a major backlash in Scotland.'

England and Scotland will face off tonight in tonight's clash at Glasgow Celtic's Parkhead stadium 

Mr Salmond announced his intention to step down just hours after losing the independence referendum.

At a press conference on September 19, he said that at the age of 59, after 20 years as SNP leader and seven years as First Minister, it was time to hand over the reins.

‘My time as leader is nearly over, but for Scotland the campaign continues and the dream shall never die,’ he told reporters at the time.

Since then, speculation over Mr Salmond's political future has led to suggestions he will return to Westminster, and he is expected to make his position clear in due course.

He remains MSP for Aberdeenshire East, but he could stand for a seat in the House of Commons at the general election in May.

Ms Sturgeon will be formally appointed as First Minister during a selection process at Holyrood tomorrow, and will be sworn in at the Court of Session in Edinburgh on Thursday.

At the party conference on Friday, her predecessor hailed her as a ‘woman of extraordinary talent’.

Mr Salmond said: ‘Nicola, your contribution to where this party now stands has already been immense. Your future contribution - I have no doubt - will be to make history.’
