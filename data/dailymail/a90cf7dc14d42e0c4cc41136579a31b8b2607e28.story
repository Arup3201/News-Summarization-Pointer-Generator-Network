Xavi is the next high-profile target for New York City as they prepare to confirm the signing of former Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard later this week.

The 34-year-old midfielder hopes to negotiate a payoff with Barcelona although it is unlikely that he will follow Lampard and David Villa to Australia to play for Manchester City’s other sister club Melbourne while they wait for the New York team to launch in Major League Soccer next year.

Xavi announced in June that he would be ending his lengthy affiliation with Barcelona.

New Barcelona manager Luis Enrique has a major rebuilding task to complete this summer as the La Liga giants have lost Victor Valdes, Carles Puyol and Cesc Fabregas since his arrival at the club. 

Barcelona have already spent £75million on Luis Suarez - but will be without the services of the Uruguayan international until he serves a four-month ban.

The Catalan giants have also sold Chile international Alexis Sanchez to Arsenal.
