There is nothing you can’t buy online, it seems.

Whether it’s an obese, naked sculpture of Arnold Schwarznegger or a 'fine art' painting of Paris Hilton, your dream item could be just a click away.

Amazon and eBay may have dominated the market for unusual tastes in recent years, but now there is a new contender to barter with: Alibaba, the world’s largest bazaar for the peculiar.

A popular piece is the life-size, obese statue of Arnold Schwarzenegger. The sculpture is completely naked, apart from shotgun and sunglasses and it could be yours for £9,900 ($16,800)

Take for instance, the vast range of used underwear. With many of the items bulk buy, your will need to order 24,000 pieces to get your hand on what is described as ‘lovely used panties’.

As Business Insider notes, this is clearly a worthwhile deal as these are not just any used panties. The seller describes them as being ‘hipster’ underwear that is both ‘fashionable’ and ‘elegant’.

The website, which aims to connect companies with wholesalers, also boasts some stunning artwork.

One company in particular, Zhongshan City Elephant Sculpture Art, is leading the way with its silicone-wax celebrity statues.

Alibaba, a Chinese online retailer, was virtually unknown outside Asia just a few years ago.

The group is now preparing an initial public offering that could raise up to £11.8 billion ($20 billion), according to some estimates.

The company, founded by charismatic CEO Jack Ma in his apartment in 1999, controls 80 per cent of all online commerce in the world's second-largest economy. And it's gearing up to conquer the American market next.

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. handled more than 1.5 trillion yuan - about £147 billion ($248 billion) - of transactions for 231 million active users across its three main Chinese online marketplaces in 2013, more than Amazon and eBay Inc combined. It did so with 20,884 full-time workers, fewer than eBay.

But if beauty products are more your thing, then Alibaba has some intriguing offers.

The female electric nose lifter, for instance, promises to give you a firmer, higher nose by zapping it with vibrations for just three minutes a day.

Not to be left out, there is also a wide array of male grooming product for sale.

Lovers of Apple products, who also happen to have an embarrassing ear wax problem, can get their hands on a Steve Jobs-banded ear cleaner tool set.

The pack contains eight items for ear cleaning and manicuring and is priced at 50p ($0.8) at a minimum order of 2,000 sets.

Another popular category on the site is ‘live animals’. In the event you need the services of a camel, then you can purchase 500 for around £350 ($600) each.

Unicorn meat (right) and Buddha-shaped pears can also be purchased in bulk on the Chinese retail website

And if you want to impress your dinner guests, Alibaba can help in that area too. The site has Buddha-shaped pears on sale, invented by a farmer in China.

The £3 ($5) fruit is the invention of Hao Xianzhang who spent six years perfecting the intricate baby pears, carefully crafting each one which grows inside an individual mould.

Alibaba was virtually unknown outside Asia just a few years ago, but the Chinese online retailer has now set its sights on global domination.

While these products may seem ridiculous, the company has a far more serious goal in sight.

The group is preparing an initial public offering that could be the largest opening stock sale in U.S. history - raising up to £11.8 billion ($20 billion), according to some estimates.

The company, founded by charismatic chief executive Jack Ma in his apartment in 1999, controls 80 per cent of all online commerce in the world's second-largest economy.

You can also purchase 1 million barrels of Libyan crude oil (left) If you don't need that, the how about a ear-wax cleaning kit with Steve Jobs' face on it? (right)

You might think excitement over getting an email died with AOL's 'you've got mail' popularity. 
But if you're one of those people who gets excited every time they get an email, then an LED light which lights up every time your inbox gets a hit, could help you share that excitement

While you're purchasing things for your office, why not take a look at the Pillow Tie - not only does it make you look smart, but it also lets you have a commutable nap at your desk
