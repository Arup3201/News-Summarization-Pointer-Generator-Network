Virgin Trains, owned by entrepreneur Richard Branson (pictured), has one of the worst records for punctuality according to today's figures

A third of trains are running late – rising to more than half among the worst performers - when judged against tougher Government-backed ‘real time’ punctuality targets, damning new figures reveal.

More than half Virgin Trains and Cross Country services fail to arrive on time when allowed just  59 seconds leeway from the timetabled schedule  to qualify as being punctual.

This strict ‘right time’ measures  contrasts with what ministers say is the more ‘dishonest’ measure favoured by the rail industry. This classes short-distance services as being ‘on time’ if they arrive within five minutes of the scheduled time. Long-distance services are officially on time if they arrive within 10 minutes.

Nationally, under the stricter 59-second rule, nearly three out of ten trains (27.7 per cent) ran late with just over seven out of ten (72.3per cent) on time from April 1 to 27.

More than four out of  ten (42 per cent) long-distance services were  late with only six out of ten (58per) cent on time in April.

In London and south-east England more than a quarter of services (27.3 per cent) of services were late with nearly three-quarters (72.7%) on time.

For regional services including Scotland a quarter (25.3 per cent)  were late with three quarters (74.7per cent) on time.

Network Rail’s  59-second figures  also revealed punctuality for each train company for the 12-month period ending on April 27. 

Percentage of trains arriving within 59seconds:

Crosscountry                                 46.1  

Virgin Trains                                    48.9  

Southern                                       55.5  

First Scotrail                                    59.8  

East Coast                                     60.9  

London Midland                              62.3  

First Transpennine Express       63.8  

Southeastern                                  64.5  

South West Trains                        67.9

First Capital Connect                      68.9

 Percentage of trains arriving within 59seconds:

London Overground                   86.8

Chiltern                                          86.5

Arriva Trains Wales                     85.5

c2c Rail                                          84.5

East Midlands Trains                  74.7

Merseyrail                                      74.6

Northern Rail                               72.2

Greater Anglia                               71.6

First Great Western                    69.3

National average for all providers is 68.0%

Among individual rail companies the poorest-performer was CrossCountry, whose routes reach every part of Britain except London. More than half of CrossCountry's trains  (53.9 per cent) were late  with only 46.1per cent  on time over the 12 month period.

It was followed by  Virgin Trains which had just 48.9per cent of trains on time, Southern (55.5per cent), First ScotRail (59.8per cent) and state-run East Coast (60.9per cent).

Best-performing company was London Overground with nearly 9 out of ten services (86.8per cent) arriving within 59 seconds of timetable.

When judged against the more liberal punctuality measures, Britain’s two main London to Scotland train companies – state-run East Coast and Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Trains - were the poorest performers for punctuality last month, rail watchdogs revealed.

One in seven (14.9 per cent)  of East Coast trains ran late with only 85.1per cent of trains on time in the period April 1-27 2013.

West Coast line operator Virgin was only marginally better with a similar proportion (14 per cent)  of services running late and just 86.0per cent on time.

On average only 68 per cent of trains arrive on time, leaving a third of passengers waiting

The national average  was for one in 14 trains running late (7 per cent) with 93.0per cent on time.

Network Rail (NR) said East Coast punctuality had been affected by two overhead line incidents - near Potters Bar in Hertfordshire and at Grantham in Lincolnshire.

Transport Minister Mr Baker said: 'It is totally dishonest to say trains are punctual when for short distance and journeys they can arrive within 4 minutes and 59 seconds and for long-distance they can be within 9 minutes and 59 seconds and still count as being officially on time.

'Taxpayers and passengers deserve better than this. That is why we have put  pressure on the rail industry to publish proper real-time performance  figures.

‘I am determined to see improvements on the level of transparency on the
railway and I am pleased that the industry is becoming more transparent
including the release of ‘right-time’ data, for which I have 
consistently pushed.

‘This goes further than anything passengers 
receive in Europe. Two out of three trains on the network are arriving 
within 59 seconds of the stated arrival time and 93% are meeting 
target. 

'This is a strong performance given the growth in passenger 
numbers. I wonder how many motorists could predict their journey time 
within a minute?'

A spokesman for the watchdog office of Rail Regulation said passengers ‘are experiencing a worse service than a year ago’, adding: ‘We are disappointed with Network Rail’s recent performance.’

The Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC) said: ‘Punctuality is vitally important to passengers and train companies and that's why we will continue to work closely with the rest of the industry to drive improvements to services.’

The London Underground is the most punctual train provider in the country, with 86.8 per cent of its trains arriving within 59 seconds
