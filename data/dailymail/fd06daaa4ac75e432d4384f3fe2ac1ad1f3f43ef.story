Seven U.S. soldiers and a member of the NATO-led coalition were killed on Saturday in one of the deadliest days for Americans and other foreign troops in Afghanistan in recent months, as the Taliban continued attacks as part of their spring offensive.

The renewed violence came as Afghan President Hamid Karzai acknowledged at a news conference that regular payments his government has received from the CIA for more than a decade would continue. Karzai also said that talks on a U.S.-Afghan bilateral security agreement to govern future American military presence in the country had been delayed because of conditions the Afghans were placing on the deal.

The U.S.-led coalition reported that five international troops were killed by a roadside bomb in southern Afghanistan, and coalition spokesman Capt. Luca Carniel confirmed that all five were American.

The coalition did not disclose the 
location of the roadside bombing. However, Javeed Faisal, a spokesman 
for the governor of Kandahar province, said the coalition patrol hit the
bomb in the Maiwand district of the province, the spiritual birthplace 
of the Taliban.

Later, the coalition reported that a 
soldier with the Afghan National Army turned his weapon on coalition 
troops in the west, killing two in the most recent of so-called insider 
attacks. Such attacks by members of the Afghan security forces against 
their fellow colleagues or international troops have eroded confidence 
in the Afghan forces as they work to take over from foreign forces.

Both killed were American, according 
to two U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose 
the nationalities ahead of an official announcement.

Another coalition service member was 
killed in an insurgent attack in northern Afghanistan, the NATO-led 
force said. It did not provide any further details of the incident.

It was the fourth time since last summer that seven Americans have been killed on a single day in the war.

On March 12, a Black Hawk helicopter 
crashed outside Kandahar, killing five U.S. troops. Two more U.S. troops
were killed that day by an insider attack.

And on April 6, Afghan militants 
killed six Americans, including a young female diplomat, and an Afghan 
doctor in a pair of attacks in southern Afghanistan. The three U.S. 
service members, two U.S. civilians and the doctor were killed when the 
group was struck by an explosion while traveling to donate books to a 
school. A seventh American, a civilian, was killed in a separate 
insurgent attack in the east.

On Aug. 16, 2012, seven American 
service members were killed in two attacks in Kandahar province. Six 
were killed when their helicopter was shot down by insurgents and one 
soldier died in a roadside bomb explosion.

At the news conference, Karzai said he
had met earlier in the day with the Kabul station chief of the CIA and 
was reassured that the agency's payments to the Afghan government would 
continue. The New York Times had reported that for more than a decade, 
the CIA had given the Afghan National Security Council tens of millions 
of dollars in monthly payments delivered in suitcases, backpacks and 
plastic shopping bags.

Karzai said he told the station chief:
"`Because of all these rumors in the media, please do not cut all this 
money because we really need it. We want to continue this sort of 
assistance.' And he promised that they are not going to cut this money."

Karzai described the payments as a 
form of "government-to-government" assistance, and while he wouldn't say
how much the CIA gave to the National Directorate of Security, which is
the Afghan intelligence service, he said the financial help was very 
useful. He claimed that much of the money was used to care for wounded 
employees of the NDS, Afghanistan's intelligence service, and 
operational expenses.

"We have spent it in different areas (and) solved lots of our problems," Karzai said.

He said the CIA payments were made in 
cash and that "all the money which we have spent, receipts have been 
sent back to the intelligence service of the United States monthly."

The CIA declined to comment on Saturday.

During the news conference at the 
presidential palace, Karzai also discussed ongoing negotiations on a 
U.S.-Afghan bilateral security agreement. He said talks had been delayed
because of certain conditions that Afghanistan was insisting be 
included in the pact, which will govern a U.S. military presence after 
2014 when nearly all foreign combat troops are to have finished their 
withdrawal from Afghanistan. The talks, which started in late 2012, are 
set to last up to a year.

President Barack Obama has not said 
how many troops will remain, although there have been estimates ranging 
from 8,000 to 12,000. It is unlikely such an announcement will be made 
until the security agreement is signed. Those troops would help train 
Afghan forces and also carry out operations against al-Qaida and other 
militant groups.

Karzai said Afghanistan was ready to 
sign a deal as long as the American government in exchange for being 
able to stay on bases in the country agrees to terms of Afghan security,
funding assistance and help with training and equipping Afghan security
forces. It is thought that the contentious issue of providing U.S. 
troops immunity from Afghan law is a low priority for the Afghan 
government in the negotiations.

The Afghan government has not said how
much rent it would want for three or four U.S. bases, but it is 
believed to be in the billions. Afghanistan is also thought to be 
seeking security guarantees to protect its porous borders, including the
frontier with Pakistan that is the main infiltration route for 
insurgents who retain sanctuary in Pakistan's lawless tribal areas.

It was unclear how Karzai expected the United States or any of its allies to guarantee Afghanistan's borders against attack.
