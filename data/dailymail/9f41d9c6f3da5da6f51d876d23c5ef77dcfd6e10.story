There are few British sportspeople who have legitimate claims to being the best in the world in their field. In golden girls Katarina Johnson-Thompson and Jessica Ennis-Hill we have two who are likely to be battling for top billing over the next two years.

British Athletics performance director Neil Black is not guilty of hyperbole when he claims their anticipated duels in the heptathlon, notably at the World Championships in Beijing this summer and the Olympic Games in Rio in 2016 represent a ‘magical time’ for the sport.

Johnson-Thompson, 22, has risen to being the world’s number one in the absence of Olympic Champion Ennis-Hill, who took a break to have baby son, Reggie. The pair’s first competitive meeting since 2012, at the Hypo-meeting in Gotzis, Austria at the end of May promises to be one of the most gripping sporting duels of the year.

Johnson-Thompson is expected to battle it out with Ennis-Hill for top billing over the next few years 

Ennis-Hill took some time out of athletics following the birth of her baby son, Reggie 

Johnson-Thompson’s first major gold medal in the pentathlon at the European Indoor Championships in Prague on Friday, where she missed out on the World Record by just 13 points, was the realisation of an incredible talent. As a teenager she beat Ennis-Hill’s junior records and is now seeing her own being broken by 17-year-old Morgan Lake.

‘I just think its an amazing set of circumstances,’ said Black, ‘I’m sure it’s partly coincidental and partly as a result of all the stimulus dating back many years, the, striving to beat each other and role models and so on. But to think that they are all going to be hopefully in Gotzis and they’re all hopefully going to be at the World Championships in Beijing in August and the Olympics next year, its just a kind of magical time. 

'And what comes from it is just going to be spectacular. I can’t see that you can get much more exciting than that in any sport this summer. You have three incredibly capable, high performing, lovely personalities, with great teams around them, brilliant coaches, all vying for medals in competitions.’

Ennis-Hill and her coach Toni Minichiello have been tight lipped about how her training at the English Institute of Sport in Sheffield is going but she has posted pictures of herself on Twitter and she looks to be in supreme shape.

‘All the feedback that we’ve had is that her progression is great,’ said Black, ‘Peter Stanley (British Athletics head of combined events) is regularly there, meeting with Jess, Toni, and the javelin sessions, the biomechanical support, they’re all working together and it’s going well.’

Black also backed sprinter Richard Kilty - who added the European Indoor Championship 60m gold to the World title he won last year - to join the sub-10sec club over 100m.

‘He’s re-established himself as a serious sprinting candidate. Of course he was frustrated not to have cemented that at the same level outdoors and I’m sure that will be his target and that’s what we’re looking for going into the World Championships.’
