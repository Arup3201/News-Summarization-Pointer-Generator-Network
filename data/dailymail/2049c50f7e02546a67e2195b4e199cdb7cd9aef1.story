A California jury decided that a former police detective and veteran, who claimed temporary insanity saying that he raped a waitress at gunpoint because he was on the antidepressant Zoloft, was in fact sane at the time of the abduction.

Jurors delivered their findings in the case of 32-year-old Anthony Nicholas Orban on Tuesday in San Bernardino County Superior Court.

The former Westminster police detective was previously convicted of raping a waitress in a brutal attack that began outside a mall in 2010.

Insane: Anthony Orban, 33, claims that his anti-depressants and PTSD lead to him having a temporary break from reality during the 2003 rape

The details of the grim crime came out
throughout the trial, telling how he allegedly raped a woman and texted
pictures of his victim to a friend while he spent two hours beating and
choking her.

Orban's attorney had argued that his 
client could not be held responsible for his actions because he was 
taking the antidepressant Zoloft, which had rendered him effectively 
unconscious at the time of the attack.

He
also brought his military service into the mix, claiming that the 
combination of his post-traumatic stress disorder following his tour of 
duty and an over-prescription of the anti-depressant made him kidnap and
rape the woman.

Orban is now awaiting his sentencing, and may face a life sentence.

Victims of sexual assault are not publicly identified so her name and age are not known, but she was allegedly forced into her car at gunpoint by Orban in the middle of the day on April 3, 2010 when she was leaving her job at the Ontario Mills Mall.

During what his lawyer described as a 'psychotic break from reality', Orban forced the woman to drive to a remote area of a Fontana business park.

There, Orban proceeded to rape, beat, choke and threaten to kill the woman for two hours.

The Orange County Register
reports that during that time, Orban, who had no prior criminal record,
texted photos to his high school friend Jeff Thomas Jelinek with the 
caption 'Look what I'm doing'.

While he was distracted for a moment, the woman was able to get out of the car and run to a nearby liquor store where she asked the store clerk to call the police.

Jelinek, 33, a former state prison guard, is also charged in the crime, but because he was not physically present at the time of the attack, his charges are less significant than Orban's, also 33.

After the woman ran off, Orban stole her keys and told Jelinek to pick him up nearby.

In his haste, he left his police-issued gun, which had his name written on the barrel, a dislodged bullet, and his sunglasses in her car.

Both Jelinek, who later erased the the text messages in what prosecutors will call a cover-up attempt, and Orban were arrested later that evening after Orban's wife reported her husband's gun missing.

He was also positive identified from the victim.

Scene: Orban allegedly forced the woman into her car by gunpoint when she left her shift at California's Ontario Mills Mall in broad daylight

The two men had allegedly spent the day before the attack together, drinking heavily.

Orban changed his plea- from the originally-submitted not guilty to not guilty by reason of insanity- last summer, claiming that the attack was a result of his excessive prescription of Zoloft, an anti-depressant, and Neurontin, an anti-seizure medication.
