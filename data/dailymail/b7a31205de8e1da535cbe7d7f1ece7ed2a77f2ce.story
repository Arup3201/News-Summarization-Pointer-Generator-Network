Paddington has become the highest-ever grossing non-Hollywood family film after banking $200million at the box office.

The independently-made film, which follows the adventures of the marmalade-loving bear, has proved to be a huge hit around the world.

But global takings for the family movie, based on Michael Bond’s book series, still fall well short of the $1.3billion made by Disney’s animated blockbuster Frozen.

Paddington, which was released in November last year and stars Ben Whishaw as the voice of the Peruvian bear, cost $55million to make compared to Frozen’s $150million, the Guardian reports.

The film made by David Heyman, the producer of Harry Potter and Gravity, sees the duffle coat-wearing bear dispatched from his native jungle by his aunt Lucy following an earthquake. 

Earlier this week, it was revealed that it had taken just over £34million in Britain last year helping home-grown independent films to capture their highest market share of the UK box office at 16 per cent.

Before its release, the British Board of Film Classification gave Paddington’ a parental guidance rating, saying it contained ‘dangerous behavior, mild threat, mild sex references and mild bad language.’

The development left the bear’s creator Michael Bond ‘totally amazed’.

The rating means the film is suitable for general viewing but some scenes may be unsuitable for children under 8 years old.

The board said the film's scenes of dangerous behavior included Paddington hiding inside a refrigerator.
