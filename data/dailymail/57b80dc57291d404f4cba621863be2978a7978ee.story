After Chris Everitt was put in charge of a failing school, he thought it would be a good idea to sit in on lessons to see how the teachers were faring.

But now he is facing strike action after the teachers claimed such a move would put them under ‘intolerable’ pressure.

Westwood Girls College was placed in special measures after it was rated inadequate by Ofsted in January.

'Inadequate': Teachers at Westwood Girls College are threatening three strikes over the next month

Mr Everitt was brought in at Easter as interim manager in an attempt to improve standards at the school in Upper Norwood, south east London.

But teachers have responded angrily, threatening three walk-outs over the next month, when many pupils are taking their exams.

Angry parents condemned the move. Lucia Castro, 40, said: ‘It seems that the school has started to pick up again recently. 

'Outrageous': Education Secretary Michael Gove has condemned the industrial action

‘Some of the teachers had it cushy all this time. They are being given more of a hard time now and they aren’t happy with it.’

Butt Rehmen, 41, said: ‘I don’t think they should go on strike – they should be monitored.’

Graham Cluer, of the NASUWT, said there had been a succession of interim heads at the school and each had carried out observations. ‘It is putting an intolerable workload and stress level on teachers,’ he claimed.

Around 40 teachers at Westwood School, which has pupils aged from 11 to 16, will strike on May 22, June 6 and June 18.

Staff from Harris Federation, an academy chain that is taking over the school in September, will hold some classes for older children and ensure exams can take place.

But children in Years 7, 8 and 9 will have to stay at home.

Mr Everitt, who is employed by the Harris Federation, said  ‘lesson observations’ were an ‘essential component’ of raising standards.

The Ofsted report noted a string of failings, including too little being known about ‘the quality of teaching in the school’.

Education Secretary Michael Gove said the threatened strikes were ‘outrageous’.
