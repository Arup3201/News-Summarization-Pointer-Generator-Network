Those wanting a bit of privacy - and the chance to pretend to be a Bond villain - can now rent a secluded house perched on top of an island.

That is, if they have £6,000 for a week's stay.

The hideaway home which sits atop the 80ft summit of Towan Island is surrounded by water during high tide with the only way to gain access via a private suspension bridge.

Welcome to the island! Lord and Lady Long have sold the property and it is now being offered as a holiday let

What a view! The remarkable dwelling, in Newquay, Cornwall, has a terrace where holiday makers can enjoy stunning sights from the privacy of their home

The home will now be available for nearly £6,000 a week - but here is no other place like it in the UK

Its suspension foot-bridge is the only means of connecting it to the mainland

Its previous owners, Lord and Lady Long,
have finally sold up for £1million because they were fed up of walking 
up the slippery granite stairs and endless noisy beach parties in 
Newquay, Cornwall.

But a British holiday firm have now 
rebranded it 'The House in The Sea' and will rent it out this summer - 
at the steep price of nearly £6,000 a week.

A week's stay will cost £5,575 for a party of six in June, although the unique pad can be had for as little as £1,845 for two people later in the year.

A spokesman for Unique Home Stays insists the steep cliffs 'should be of no concern - indeed that is one of the main attractions of this unique property.'

Marketing manager Claire Ray said: 'There is no other beach holiday experience like it available.

'Guests will be able to hoist a flag 
to let everyone know they are in residence and they have their own 
suspension bridge gated at the mainland end to ensure complete privacy.'

The remarkable dwelling, in Newquay, 
Cornwall, was built in the 1901 and was once owned by Sir Oliver Joseph 
Lodge, inventor of the spark plug.

And rather fittingly for a pad 
reminiscent of a super villain's hideout, Sherlock Holmes creator Sir 
Arthur Conan Doyle was once a visitor.

The previous owners Lord and Lady Long
sold it last year for a reported £1 million after complaining that the 
steps either side of the swaying 100ft Edwardian bridge had become too 
much.

They had purchased their retirement home in 2001, but put it up for sale in 2010.

The pair had formed an action group to
'smarten up' the reputation of Newquay, long regarded as a haven for 
drunken, raucous parties.

For decades the house perched 80ft high has been a source of fascination - now visitors can experience island life

The tiny home sits in the centre of the sandy beach, and visitors will be able to hear the waves lap the rock they are perched on

In the summer of 2003, Lady Long 
penned a four-page letter to her local council saying that it had a duty
to bring the mayhem on the beach to an end.

Many in the town were appalled by the negative publicity - especially 
those making money out of the revellers - but others agreed with the 
Longs and formed the Newquay Action Group (NAG) to get the place cleaned
up.

Lady Long once applied to the Guinness Book of Records to have Towan Island officially recognised as the world's smallest island.

But officials ruled it does not qualify - because it has less than 50 residents - and said it was technically an outcrop.

This was the third time the property has been offered for sale in the last 40 years.
