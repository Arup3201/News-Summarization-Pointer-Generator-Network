Smiling in each others' arms, Paul Gascoigne and his new love appear to be the very picture of domestic bliss as they happily pose together in the garden of his new home.

But just two days after the new couple embraced at the former England footballer's house in Poole, Dorset, Mandy Thomas was on her way to hospital where Gascoigne was being treated following another alcohol meltdown.

The midfielder was sectioned under the Mental Health Act after medics were called to his home in the early hours of Friday morning.

The former football star has been placed on a three-day emergency detox and friends say his new 44-year-old girlfriend has vowed to stand by him and is helping him with his recovery.

A friend told The Sun: 'Mandy is determined to help him. She is looking forward to him coming out and recovering.'

The couple, who only recently started seeing each other, were pictured out and about just 48 hours before Gascoigne was rushed to hospital and sectioned for his own safety.

They are said to have met after the former England midfielder visited the post office she runs in Bournemouth, Dorset.

A friend of the star told the newspaper: 'He kept going in there and he would laugh and joke with her. They then started seeing each other - going for walks and coffee. They are so happy together.'

Ms Thomas, who is separated from her husband and has two children, is said to be 'besotted' with the star with whom she has become 'inseparable'.

She reportedly helped him move into his new apartment in the expensive area of Sandbanks in Poole in August.

The couple, who have only been seeing each other recently, were spotted 48 hours before he was sectioned

It was shortly after he was released from Poole Hospital after another alcoholic breakdown where he was found slumped outside his flat clutching a bottle of gin.

Friends say that the new couple are seeing his move as a fresh start and that Mandy hopes to help him through the most recent 'setback'.

But neighbours are concerned Gascoigne's life is spiralling out of control and one, who did not want to be named, admitted seeing him falling out of a taxi drunk at 3.30pm two weeks ago.

Another told the newspaper: 'It's sad. I saw him wandering down the road at lunchtime on Thursday. He was in normal clothes - and slippers.

The 47-year-old was rushed to hospital at 3am on Friday morning and sectioned under the Mental Health Act

'It's probably for the best that he has been sectioned.'  

The former England and Tottenham Hotspur footballer has suffered a long battle with alcoholism and was previously sectioned six years ago.

Close friend and former teammate Gary Mabbutt told The Sun: 'He has been detained for his best interests. Paul has had a relapse and hasn't been well for a couple of weeks now.

'The best support available is being given to Paul. Hopefully he can get on the road to recovery.'

A source also told the paper that Gascoigne had not been in a 'good state' and police and doctors were 'really worried about him'.

The star, who made 57 appearances for his country, has been in rehab seven times and was first sectioned under the Mental Health Act in 2008, following an incident at a Newcastle hotel.

His seventh stint in rehab was in January this year when he checked into a £6,000-a-month treatment clinic in Southampton. 

Catch of the day: Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne netted two huge fish during an outing with a friend in Hampshire last week

Last month the star was pictured cradling a chicken whilst enjoying a pint and speaking to locals in a pub beer garden. 

A spokesman for his former club Spurs told the newspaper: 'We are aware of the situation with Paul and continue to offer our support.' 

Gascoigne's agent Terry Baker told MailOnline that the star 'is not very well' but refused to comment on his condition any further.
