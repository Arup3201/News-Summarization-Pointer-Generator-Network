A schoolteacher who narrowly avoided a prison sentence for seducing one of her pupils has told a court she is 'fully co-operating' with social workers after her 'ten days of madness'.

Married Bernadette Smith, 35, escaped a jail sentence after she was convicted of kissing and cuddling 16-year-old schoolboy Gary Ralston at his home in Cowie, Stirlingshire, and at a park in Falkirk.

The mother of three, who was sacked from her position at Bannockburn High School in Stirling over the incident, said she kept a tiny vest top on and did not have sex with the boy when she stayed over at his house in September last year.

At a review hearing at Stirling Sheriff Court today, Smith (pictured outside with friends) was said to be 'fully co-operating' with the case management process and was told she wasn't required to attend court again

She admitted her wrongdoing in February and was sentenced to a two-year supervision order and ordered to sign the sex offenders' register.

Today, she appeared at Stirling Sheriff Court, for a community payback order review, and told the judge she was putting her life back in order after the scandal.

The court was given a report prepared by officials responsible for her supervision and her lawyer, Alistair Milne, said she was fully co-operating.

He said: 'The report is, in my submission, fully favourable, and there is a clear recommendation to allow the order to run its course.

'There has been a full level of co-operation on her part.'

Smith, of Denny, Stirlingshire, who appeared in the dock today wearing a black and grey skirt, a black top and high-heeled ankle boots, avoided jail in February after Sheriff Robertson told her that her conduct was at the lesser end of the scale for the type of sex offence with which she was charged.

At the time, the court heard how she told police and colleagues that she was 'in love' with Gary, who she had taught and also given after-school tuition. 

The affair started in Smith's classroom when she confessed her feelings to 16-year-old Gary and the pair later went to the park and kissed. That night, she went to his house and stayed over but did not have sex with him

The 16-year-old schoolboy (pictured in his bedroom) later said Smith was his favourite teacher and that he 'couldn't believe she was with me'. He said 'a lot of the boys fancied her' and said: 'She did me no harm'

The court had heard how the affair started in Smith's classroom where she confessed her feelings to the boy, who has since waived his anonymity, before the pair went to a park and had their first kiss.

That night, Smith visited the house Gary shared with his father, Richard, and she and the schoolboy spent the night together in Gary's bed.

The pair were caught after Gary's grandmother found out and told the school, which suspended Smith immediately. At the time, Gary's father admitted to being ‘a bit’ proud of his son for catching the teacher’s eye.

Prosecutor Ann Orr said: 'She admitted she met him on two occasions outside school and kissed him on the mouth and neck.

'She also admitted meeting at his home and told his father about her feelings and she stayed overnight in the boy's bedroom and that she had been wearing her jeans and a bra.

'She said during the interview that she loved the boy and they both wanted to be together.'

Smith had claimed in court that her behaviour was sparked over her husband Brian's continued deceit over an affair. 

The English and history teacher claimed she started her affair after trying to be a ‘positive influence’ on Gary and said it evolved after she poured her heart out to him about her problems at home.

Sentencing her, Sheriff Robertson told her: 'Some of course may say that had it not been detected it could have led to more serious activity towards the other end of the scale, but that is speculation.

'You have lost your reputation, your job and your career, and your marriage is at an end.

'You have caused distress to your immediate family, and with the media attention that this case has attracted, I suspect that your humiliation is complete.'

In light of the incident, Smith was struck off by General Teaching Council for Scotland.

After pleading guilty, Gary said Smith was always his favourite teacher and added: 'A lot of the boys fancied her. I couldn't believe she was with me.

'It was the last thing I expected. She said she thought she was going crazy but couldn't help the way she was feeling.

'She did me no harm and I'm fine.

'Looking back, I wish it hadn't happened. It was exciting but it wasn't worth it - not for her anyway.'

During today's review hearing, Sheriff Wyllie Robertson said the order could now continue without any further court appearances.

He told Smith: 'The purpose of this review was to ensure that there has been full and complete engagement with the order and I'm reassured in the terms of the report that you are participating fully in the case management process.

'I will allow the order to continue without any further review.'
