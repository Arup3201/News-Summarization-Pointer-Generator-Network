As a man not unaccustomed to the fortunes of National Hunt racing, Ally McCoist well knows the wisdom of paying scant regard to the opening few furlongs of a chase. No bookmaker in the land will make good on a wager until the winning line has been breached.

Accordingly, the Rangers manager believes those viewing Monday’s clash with Hibernian at Ibrox as some kind of title eliminator aren’t so much jumping the gun as calling the race before the protagonists are even in the stalls.

Alan Stubbs’ team have managed just two wins from six thus far and currently sit seventh in the Championship – a long way from the form expected and certainly far removed from that which will cement an immediate return to the top-flight.

The Ibrox manager insists it is too early to write off Hibernian, even though they have struggled this season 

Yet, even if defeat on Monday were to widen the gap between them and Rangers to 10 points after just seven matches, McCoist feels the Easter Road side would still remain part of a chasing pack eminently capable of making up the ground over the course of 36 matches.

‘No matter how the game goes on Monday, there is far too long to go in the Championship to start ruling anyone out at this stage,’ the Rangers boss insisted.

‘We’ve seen how difficult it has been and is going to be. With 15 minutes to go at Alloa, we would have taken a point all day to get out of there. I know Hearts had chances at Dumbarton, but Dumbarton had a couple of their own, too.

‘There are Edinburgh derbies to play, we’ve got to go through to Tynecastle and Easter Road — there’s a massive, massive distance to go.’

Nonetheless, those predicting that Hibs would arrest their decline to race neck-on-neck with their rivals from Ibrox and Tynecastle from the outset have been forced into a quick revision.

Alan Stubbs' Hibs side have endured a frustrating start to the season and are 7th in the Scottish Championship 

Despite Stubbs’ imaginative appointment, old habits – mostly bad – have died hard. Yet McCoist feels anyone anticipating some kind of uncontested three-way slug for first place makes no allowance for the environment in which the big guns are now operating.

‘I think it says more about the opposition and the standard more than anything else,’ he added of Hibs’ form.

‘I’m certainly not going to be critical of Hibs who have played better football against us than probably anyone else this season. In the (Challenge) Cup game, I felt they played exceptionally well at times.

‘We’ve known all along that going to places like Alloa and Queen of the South is extremely difficult as these teams, if they play well, can surprise anyone in the country.’

If Hibs were able to cast off that previous 2-1 Ibrox defeat with a degree of nonchalance given the second-rate competition it took place in, another loss would hugely lengthen the odds on them pipping their rivals at the post come May.

So do Rangers anticipate facing a Hibs side even more focused than that which they defeated in August?

‘It’s still really early in the season, but I don’t think Hibs will be wanting to win any more than they would normally when they come to our place,’ McCoist added. 

‘They were here earlier in the season and for long periods played really well. I would imagine Alan would have been delighted with that level of performance, if not with the result. So I don’t think because of their league position they will come and play any harder.’

Not that Rangers can afford to lose any more ground on leaders Hearts, either. A poor performance in a 1-1 draw at Alloa last weekend left the Ibrox men three points and three goals behind a Tynecastle side which entertain Livingston on Saturday.

For so long the runaway leaders of Leagues One and Two, Rangers now find themselves recast as the men with ground to make up.

‘It’s not something that’s a shock to us,’ McCoist insisted. ‘We knew the league would be a massive step-up from the previous two seasons and when you lose the first game to Hearts, chances are you will be chasing them for a wee while anyway.

‘We’re six games into it, it’s not really started the campaign, really. There are lots of points to be won and dropped. Hearts drew at Dumbarton and I felt the same way last week after the Alloa game - that might turn out to be a good point rather than two dropped.

‘Hearts are at the top and playing very well consistently. They had a good second half against Cowdenbeath last weekend. For the first time in a couple of years we are looking above us but it’s not a major shock or something we’re overly concerned with this early in the season.’

Regardless of the off-field concerns that are just part of the fixtures and fittings of Ibrox these days, Rangers fans at least have competitive football to embrace each week.

If there was initially a novelty about turkey shoots against plumbers and plasterers of the lower divisions, it soon passed.

Now engaged in what’s already an intriguing battle for an automatic return to the top flight, the days when indifferent league results just didn’t really matter are a thing of the past.

‘I think our players, in terms of their own self-motivation, have been commendable in the last couple of years,’ McCoist offered.

‘To go through a league season undefeated and with three draws would tell you that the motivation to go and play in all these league games has been fine. I really do think that.

‘You can argue about our levels of performance, of course you can, but in terms of motivation to go and play, the boys have been fine with that.

‘But I also think they are aware of the increase of the standard of the opposition and the better quality of grounds that we are going to, generally speaking, like Falkirk, Tynecastle, Easter Road and places like that.

‘So there’s an obvious step-up in everything. I think our motivation over the last two or three years has been absolutely fine, but it will have to stay at that level.’
