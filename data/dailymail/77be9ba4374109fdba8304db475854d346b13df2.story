It is one of the lesser known but more remarkable facts in the annals of cricketing history that Adolf Hitler once took an interest in the game – then fell out with it decisively.

This was witnessed at first-hand by British Army officers held prisoner in Germany during the First World War, who met the then corporal and were surprised to find him asking for an explanation of the rules.

A few days later, Hitler returned to announce that he had been training a team of Germans and wanted to play the English at the earliest opportunity. The scores are unknown.

Welcome: A Berlin newspaper reports the arrival of the team for the three-day test match in August 1937

Alas, Hitler found the sport insufficiently violent for the prime of German volk. In particular, it was ‘unmanly’ for batsmen to wear pads to protect their legs.

And so it came to be that, for disciples of National Socialism, cricket was not just English, but effeminate.

It is not as if the Nazis were fans of modern sport in any form. Once in power, they legalised sabre-duelling, where the object was to inflict a scar on your opponent’s face.

With war clouds gathering, the decision by Nazi Reichssportführer, Hans von Tschammer und Osten, a close friend of Hitler, to invite a touring English cricket team to Berlin is something of a mystery.

Yet in August 1937, after travelling by ship, the Prince Baudouin, from Dover to Ostend, and then by train to Berlin, The Gentlemen of Worcestershire found themselves in the city for the start of a three-match series.

The matches took place on a bumpy football pitch with a thin strip of matting to serve as a wicket. First, however, there was a local custom to observe. Shortly before 11.30am, the two teams stood in a line facing one another on the outfield.

Once in place, German captain Gerhard Thamer shouted: ‘Worcestershire Gentlemen, Sieg… ’

‘Heil!’ barked members of the Berlin team in perfect unison, their arm raised in salute. The Gents were keen to be courteous. Their Captain, Major Maurice Jewell, cleared his throat, and in rather less strident tones than Thamer, said: ‘Berlin CC, Sieg… ’

‘Heil,’ came the rather uncertain response from his men.

The Gents would later claim that whenever someone offered them the Nazi salute, they responded by lifting their hats, which indicates a desire to rewrite history somewhat.

The Gents were independent men  of leisure or successful businessmen.

In the 1930s they had been made welcome in the Netherlands, Portugal and Denmark, though at a fairground in Copenhagen they were banned from the coconut shy after winning all the prizes.

The club was formed in the 1880s, around the same time as Worcestershire County Cricket Club and by many of the same people.

On July 31, 1937, Berrow’s Worcestershire Journal announced that ‘a team of Worcestershire Gentlemen leaves shortly for Berlin, for ten days’ cricket in the capital’.

The team comprised Major Jewell, R. G. W. Berkeley, C. S. Anton, W. Deeley, G. S. Tomkinson, R. H. Williams, C. G. D. Smith, H. T. H. Foley, M. Jewell,  R. Whetherly, C. Terry, P. Huntington-Whiteley and P. Robinson.

Major Jewell was the son of the British Vice-Consul in the port of Iquique in Chile, and a former captain of Worcestershire, while the Huntington-Whiteleys were minor aristocracy who kept an early but fearsomely accurate bowling machine in their conservatory.

The P. Huntington-Whiteley playing for the Gents was the great-great-uncle of supermodel Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.

For all the Third Reich’s loathing  of the game, cricket and Germany shared a secret history.

The first detailed guide to the game was printed in Bavaria in 1796, part of a snappily titled collection called Games And Exercises For The Relaxation Of The Body And The Mind For Young People, Their Instructors And All Friends  Of The Innocent Joys Of Youth.

Germany played France in an unofficial Test in Hamburg in 1865, although both teams were filled with English amateurs. By the late 1880s, a small group of Berliners had started playing and, over time, the sport had gained enough credibility to attract some Germanic orderliness.

When the German authorities decided to classify various sports and activities, cricket received the highest ranking: Schlagball erster Klasse.

The Germans were keen to stamp their own identity on the game –  a batsman became Schlagmann, a bowler became Ballmann, the wicket was known as Tor, and the umpire was the Schiedsrichter. Both teams were required to line up 15 minutes before the match for an inspection.

The sport continued to develop in the early 20th Century. The Berlin League was created and boasted 14 teams at the height of its popularity.

In 1911, Leicester Cricket Club became the first English team to visit Germany, led by peace activist the Reverend Frank Seaward Beddow.

His team won all four matches comfortably.

The Fuhrer thought that it was unmanly for players to wear pads

A grand banquet followed and the merriment spilled from the clubhouse on to the field. Mr Beddow stood up to thank his hosts, but was interrupted and told that giving a speech in an open space was illegal and he was liable for a 20 mark fine.

The Worcestershire Gents were strictly amateur, yet the tour was a serious matter. The request had come from the German authorities and two of the three matches were seen, by Berliners at least, as unofficial Tests.

The rising stakes created enough concern for the then chairman of England’s Test selectors, Sir Pelham ‘Plum’ Warner, to warn Jewell that he’d rather they didn’t lose and hand the Nazis a propaganda coup.

It was no surprise that all three games went to the Gents, mainly because the German batting was lamentable – in one innings they were dismissed for a paltry 19 runs.

The Gents were struck by several odd features of the German approach. Particularly disconcerting was the cry of ‘Aus!’ from the whole fielding side whenever the ball struck a pad. The Gents were of a generation that appealed only for certainties, and even then it was the job of the bowler and wicketkeeper to make an enquiry to the umpire.

Another shock was the casual violence meted out on the field of play.

Journey into the unknown: They took the Prince Baudouin to Ostend then went to Berlin by train for the tour

German captain Thamer spent the series castigating his players for errors and screaming his frustration whenever a chance went begging.

During one match, a young team-mate dropped two catches so Thamer casually walked over to him and sent him crashing to the floor with a right hook. The game continued as the poor fielder writhed about on the grass.

When, the story was reported later to Tschammer und Osten, the Reichssportführer, replied: ‘Yes, I have heard about it. But I understand it was a very simple catch.’

It is hardly a surprise that some of the Gents started to feel a nagging disquiet: SS men patrolling the streets, buildings festooned with Nazi flags, and anti-Semitic signs all made them uneasy. Even more alarmingly, the sound of machine-guns being fired could be heard.

Senior Gents sensed something was ‘odd’ and they concluded on their return to Britain that Nazi Germany was a ‘strange country’.

So why did the Germans allow a group of gentlemen from the Malverns to play cricket in their capital?

It seems likely that the regime was keen to cash in on the propaganda success of the previous year’s Olympic Games in Berlin.

So when the Gentlemen of Worcestershire accepted the invitation, they were treated like special envoys.

Certainly they made a good impression in the city. Their arrival in Berlin was widely reported, while on their departure, Die Fußball-Woche wrote: ‘Auf Wiedersehen, Good Fellows.’

The paper expressed hope that the visitors were returning home with a more positive impression of Germany than the one reported in the British media.

The Gents arrived during Nazi celebrations of Berlin's 700th birthday in August 1937

The Reichssportführer announced that he wanted German exchange students in Britain to be initiated into the ‘Mysterien des Kricket’.

But on March 12, 1938, the Wehrmacht marched into Hitler’s homeland, Austria. The Sudetenland was occupied that October, and in September 1939, Hitler invaded Poland.

He didn’t even have the decency to wait until the end of the cricket season. Two days later, Britain and France declared war on Germany.

This pretty much marked an end to organised cricket in Germany. The blazing summer of 1937 when Englishmen played friendly games now seems a lifetime ago.
