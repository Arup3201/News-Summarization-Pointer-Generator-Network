Chelsea winger Marko Marin is in talks with Besiktas over a loan move to the Turkish side while Hannover are also interested.

Marin, 25, was on loan at Sevilla last season and has spoken to Demba Ba about joining him at Besiktas.

Club president Fikert Orman told the Sun: 'We are in talks with Marin. We could sign him or go for a name we haven't been linked yet.

New start: Marko Marin spent last season on loan at Sevilla after struggling for playing time at Chelsea

Ba said: 'Marin called me after my transfer to Besiktas. He told me they were also interested in him and said he would like to play alongside me.

'Chelsea are probably going to loan him out again, so this is something that could happen.'

The Germany international joined Chelsea from Werder Bremen in 2012 with a big reputation but has struggled to break into the Chelsea side and has only made six appearances for the Blues.

Meanwhile, Chelsea’s Lucas Piazon, 20, has joined Eintracht Frankfurt on loan.

The Brazilian has found it difficult to break into the first team at Stamford Bridge since his arrival in 2012 and spent last season on loan at Vitesse Arnhem where he scored 11 goals in 29 appearances.

Wigan are interested in Chelsea’s George Saville, 21, while Josh McEachran, 21, may be loaned to the Spanish second division.

Sunderland have asked for Patrick van Aanholt on loan from Chelsea.
