Bald truth: TV presenter Martin Roberts today

The facade, when seen from the front at least, was immaculate – ageless even. Pop around the back, though, and the view was, some might say, in dire need of repairs.

Homes Under The Hammer host Martin Roberts is as well known for his ‘big hair’ as he is for his eye for a bargain.

The highlights may have become subtler since he presented Wish You Were Here in the Nineties, but the hairsprayed bouffant remained immovable.

However, the 49-year-old has been hiding something from his two million viewers: a large bald patch on his crown.

And, not one to shy away from renovation work, last November Martin secretly underwent a hair-transplant operation.

The father of two, who later this year celebrates a decade of presenting the series, joined celebrities such as Wayne Rooney and Jason Donovan in opting for a surgical solution to overcome hair loss.

Last year, almost 300,000 of these operations took place – and 83 per cent of patients were men. The boom is in part due to how common hair loss is: a quarter of men are balding by the age of 30.

Yet Martin admits the big reveal – as it’s known in the home makeover business – is yet to come. It can take up to a year for transplanted hair follicles to spring to life, which is why the back of his head looks pretty much the same as it did before the £12,000 procedure. And in that time, as our pictures show, he is left wondering: Has it worked at all?

‘I think I’m holding up reasonably well for my age,’ Martin says. ‘But a few years ago, I went for a trim and when the hairdresser held up a mirror, I noticed a visible patch of scalp.’

Worse was to come. ‘Since then, I’ve been aware of it much more when I’ve been doing the show,’ he continues. ‘Whenever I saw myself turn around on camera, I really noticed I was balding.’ 

Those who experience hair loss 
earlier in life might consider a man nearing 50 lucky to still have most
of his. But Martin wasn’t happy.

‘My hairstyle has become a bit of a trademark. When I’m in the 
supermarket and haven’t done my hair, no one knows who I am. Suddenly I 
had to consider asking the cameraman to be careful how he shoots me.’

Martin, who lives near Bath with his wife Kirsty, 44, and their two children, had the treatment at the Crown Clinic in Manchester. The clinic is run by leading transplant surgeon Asim Shahmalak, who approached Martin after noticing his bald patch on the show.

The technique Dr Shahmalak opted for – follicular unit extraction – involved transplanting 4,200 individual hairs from the back of the head to the crown in a procedure spread over two days.

‘I wasn’t sure about it right up to the last minute,’ says Martin. ‘With any medical procedure where injections are given and incisions are made, there are risks. It was all explained to me but I was still nervous. In the end, it wasn’t painful, as the scalp is completely anaesthetised. The staff even had Homes Under The Hammer on the TV while they were doing the procedure.’

Dr Shahmalak says: ‘There is minimal bleeding. The hair itself falls out within a few weeks but the root remains in place. After six months, new hair will start to appear but it can take up to a year for some people to really notice a difference. The success rate in terms of healthy new growth is 90 to 95 per cent.’

Even the best surgeons admit up to 15 per cent of transplanted follicles fail to grow. As well as transplanted hair going into shock and falling out, so too can existing hair.

Men can also continue to lose hair after a transplant – so, over time, they may require more than one operation. However, there is a limit to how many transplants a person can have.

‘We have 100,000 hairs on our head and we can move up to 7,000 hairs in one operation and up to 25,000 over a lifetime,’ says Dr Bessam Farjo, of the Farjo Medical Centre.

After the operation, men have to sleep sitting up so the newly sewn roots do not get dislodged, and they are advised to avoid washing their hair for a week, because roots need to develop a healthy new blood supply.

Five per cent of patients experience complications, including scarring, rashes and bleeding bumps. For every success, there is evidence of high-profile failures: Nicolas Cage and Mel Gibson are both rumoured to have undergone hair transplants and are still balding.

But finding solid statistics on failure rates is impossible. ‘Clinics would never disclose such a thing as an unsatisfied patient,’ explains consumer champion Spencer Stevenson, who runs the hair-loss advice website spexhair.co.uk. He underwent five hair transplants – at a cost of £33,000 – before finally getting a good result.

‘Clinics prey on the vulnerable,’ he adds. ‘In my experience, patients often end up disappointed, especially in Britain. UK transplant clinics are not highly regarded – that is why so many men travel to Europe and America instead. Failure is rife and I would say 50 per cent of men who come to me for advice are seeking repairs after having work done in Britain. Often they say there were rushed into a decision.’

Stevenson hears from men who had outdated procedures, have unnatural-looking hair growth or little growth at all, or scarring in the transplanted area ‘to the point where the patient is disfigured’.

He also claims celebrities such as Martin often add to the confusion: ‘I have heard from men who have visited surgeons with high-profile clients and had disastrous results,’ he says. ‘Maybe the celebrities – who often get their operation for free in return for agreeing to publicity – were just fortunate, or maybe they got better treatment. Who knows?’

Martin admits he did not pay for his procedure but says he would have. Despite the concerns, demand continues unabated. Dr Shahmalak says: ‘There has been a 25 per cent increase in demand in the past two to three years. One reason is there are clear psychological benefits for some men. I often see men who are depressed and anxious because of their hair loss.’

A 2005 study in Spain looked at how hair loss affected psychological wellbeing. Researchers quizzed 1,500 men and found that two-thirds of those who had hair loss suffered a drop in self-confidence.

Martin believes the operation was worth it. ‘Lots of blokes will happily spend £12,000 on a car but not on their bodies. It’s crazy that a man should feel embarrassed about having a transplant.’

Only those closest to him have been informed – until now. The only visible sign after surgery was the short growth at the back of the head that was shaved to remove the follicles for transplant.

Martin admits he would be ‘a bit annoyed’ if his hair failed to improve, but says he remains ‘optimistic’. He adds: ‘In the photos I think I can see new hair growing. Will it end up being a full bushy head of hair? Only time will tell.’

The current gold standard procedures of hair restoration surgery are ultra-refined follicular unit transplant (FUT), and follicular unit extraction (FUE).

A single root produces one hair, but roots are found in clusters of two, three or four, which share blood supply and essential glands. This is a follicular unit.

FUT involves taking skin from the back of the scalp and, under a microscope, dissecting the follicular units before implanting them at angles in tiny incisions in the area that is balding.Preserving the follicular unit and its blood supply gives a more natural appearance and increases survival rates of grafts.

The term ‘ultra-refined’ refers to how densely packed the grafts are – about 45 hairs per square centimetre.

FUE involves using a small  drill to remove intact follicular units directly from the scalp. It is a more lengthy and technical difficult procedure, and can  cost more.

Although cheaper than FUE, the disadvantage of the FUT procedure is a thin but potentially noticeable scar across the back of the head.

‘For patients who are over 40 and don’t wear their hair very short, I recommend FUT as it’s quicker, less expensive, and the scar is easily hidden,’ explains Dr Bessam Farjo. ‘In a younger patient, where future hair loss is difficult to predict, FUE is often preferable. It is more expensive but the scarring is scattered over the back of the scalp.’

Reputable clinics should be registered with the Care Quality Commission. Dr Farjo says: ‘Last year, about two per cent of patients were unhappy with the results of their surgery after 12 months – usually with the amount of hair regrowth – according to our audits. Any surgeon who can’t instantly tell you their figure either doesn’t know, which goes against CQC recommendations, or they don’t want to tell you the truth.’

Trusted organisations include the International Alliance of Hair Restoration Surgeons (iahrs.org), the Hair Transplant Network (hairtransplantnetwork.com), and the International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery (ishrs.org).
