The makers of a baby bouncer chair launched an investigation today after a mother claimed her nine-week-old daughter was left with a black eye after an accident when she struggled to remove a bar.

Charlotte Priestley, 19, says she was struggling to release the bar on the £49 battery-powered bouncer when one side suddenly came loose and struck her little girl in the face.

The Pretty in Pink Blossomy Blooms  seat, which Charlotte, from Launceston, Cornwall, says was brand new, has a plastic toy bar with a hanging rattle and teddy which can be removed to lift the baby out.

Injured: Nine-week-old Masie Castle was left with a black eye after she was hit in the face by a supposedly quick-release bar on her baby bouncer, it was claimed today

Its makers Bright Stars say the bar 'removes easily with one hand for easy access to baby'.

But when Charlotte tried to remove the bar using the plastic slide clips one side became stuck - meaning she had to tug on the bar to work it loose.

She says the bar then smashed into her baby's face as it flew out. The little girl's face swelled up, leaving her with a cut forehead and a black eye.

Charlotte and partner Ryan Castle, 18, rushed Masie to a minor injuries clinic for a check-up.

Doctors told them to watch for signs of brain injury, advising they take Masie home and wake her up every two hours in case she slipped unconsciousness.

Charlotte, of Launceston, Cornwall, said: 'The bar is supposed to be removed really easily, and you have to move it to get her out, so it should be safe.

'But it stuck, and of course because you are trying to take it off you are pulling it and it just hit her in the face. She started screaming and screaming.

Distraught: Mother Charlotte Priestley, 19, with daughter Masie, who she says has been crying and reaching for her eye since she was wounded

Heartbreaking: 'With a tiny baby you try to do everything right, now we have a baby with a black eye,' Charlotte says

't was horrible. I felt so helpless. I certainly won't be using it again. I just want other mums to know about it so it doesn't happen to anyone else.

'I was up all night crying. It was horrible. And now we have a baby with a huge black eye, all black and red.

'She is crying all the time and trying to touch her eye, so it is obviously bothering her.It's heartbreaking.

'With such a tiny baby you just try to do everything right, and now we have a baby with a black eye and a cut on her head. Obviously she can't tell us how it feels. It's awful.'

First-time mother Charlotte had used the chair for Masie while she sterilised bottles.

According to the manufacturer's website the 'precious bouncer' produces 'soothing vibrations and sweet melodies sure to delight your little one'.

Safety first: Kids II, the company who manufacture the bouncer, say they 'strive to make products that are enjoyable, but most importantly safe'

The couple have since emailed Kids II, the U.S. company who manufacture the Bright Starts chair, to complain.

An email to the parents said: 'We are sorry to hear of this report with the Bright Starts Swing. Please let me if your daughter is OK. We always want to ensure the safety of you and your child.

'We thank you for taking the time to notify us and we want to make sure that your child is doing fine and quickly get this resolved for you.'

The company, who have contacted Charlotte for more information on the incident, said today that safety was always their prime concern when manufacturing baby products.

'At Kids II we not only strive to make products that are enjoyable but that are most importantly safe for parents and children,' a spokesman said.

'Kids II products meet or exceed all international safety guidelines and regulations.

'As far as the incident you are inquiring about, we are not able to provide a proper response at this time as we have not been able to speak directly with the consumer despite our attempts, nor have we had an opportunity to review the incident as we were just notified earlier today via email.'
