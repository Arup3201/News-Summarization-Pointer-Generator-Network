You buy her flowers, shower her with compliments and listen to everything she says. Yet she doesn’t want to see you again.

If scientists are right, you were simply too nice.

Research into first dates suggests that while men like a woman who hangs onto their every word, women are less impressed by nice men.

Too much? Research has suggested that being too attentive on a date can fail to please women

In fact, they may find a caring, sharing male as a bit of a wimp or even slightly creepy.

The researchers said: ‘Women may be suspicious of a responsive stranger’s intentions, attributing his responsiveness to possible ulterior motives.’

Psychologists from Israel and the U.S. ran three experiments in which two strangers chatted either face-to-face or online.

One member of the pair was instructed to unburden themselves of a problem that was troubling them, from money worries to a failed exam or an argument with friend, while the second listened and responded.

Creepy? It has been suggested that being too nice can lead women to think a date has ulterior motives

The men liked being paired with a woman who was caring and sympathetic.

Such a female was rated as being more feminine and more attractive.

Plus, a woman who was a good listener was seen as potential for a long-term relationships, the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin reports.

It seems a woman’s concern may have boosted the male ego, as well as making her seem like good mother material.

Lead researcher Gurit Birnbaum, of the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya in Israel, said: ‘Men may interpret women’s responsiveness as a sign of sexual interest and react accordingly by perceiving them as more attractive.’

However, the women did not find a caring man more appealing or any more masculine. If anything, they found him slightly less attractive.

The researchers believe that this doesn’t necessarily mean women are hard-hearted.

Instead, the different reactions of the women taking part may simply have cancelled each other out.

For instance, a caring man may have be viewed as a good catch, a wimp or a creep.

Dr Birnbaum said: ‘Women may perceive this man as inappropriately nice and manipulative - i.e. trying to obtain sexual favours, or eager to please, perhaps even as desperate, and therefore less sexually appealing.

‘Alternatively women may perceive a responsive man as vulnerable and less dominant.

‘Other women may perceive a responsive stranger as warm and caring and therefore as a desirable long-term partner.

‘Regardless of the reasons, perhaps men should slow down if their goal is to instil sexual desire.

‘Sexual desire thrives on rising intimacy and being responsive is one of the best ways to instil this elusive sensation over time.

‘Our finding show this does not necessarily hold true in an initial encounter because a responsive potential partner may convey opposite meanings to different people.'
