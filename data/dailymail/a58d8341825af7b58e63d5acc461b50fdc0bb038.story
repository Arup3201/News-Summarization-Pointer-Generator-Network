West Ham United's first Premier League game of the season against London rivals Tottenham Hotspur could set fans back as much as £77 for an adult ticket, causing uproar among Hammers fans.

Saturday's opener at Upton Park, kicking off at 3pm, has been classed as a Category A fixture, with the cheapest ticket for members £50 and non-members £55.

In stark contrast, Hull City, who finished just three points below the Hammers in their first season back in the Premier League, are charging a flat price of £16 around the ground for their first home fixture against Bojan Krkic's new club Stoke City on Sunday August 24.

Hottest ticket in town? West Ham are preparing for their penultimate season at Upton Park

Extortionate: The West Ham website shows the most expensive tickets for non-members as £75

Hundreds of fans will march on Premier League and Football League headquarters on Thursday to demand cheaper tickets across the board, with the Football Supporters' Federation (FSF) heading the protests.

Supporters believe the increase in the multi-billion pound TV deals, including the Premier League media deal worth £5.5billion, should allow for a decrease in ticket prices.

Kevin Miles, chief executive of the FSF, said: 'Nine out of 10 fans think football's simply too expensive. 

'There's always the odd deal that clubs can quote to play it down, but the truth is supporters tell us they think tickets cost too much.'

Bang for buck: West Ham are the most expensive for home and away fans, while Hull represent the cheapest

Paying for what? Many feel West Ham's style of play does not warrant such prices, despite being a London club

West Ham are charging juniors £41 in Band 1 areas of the ground, while Hull fans under 15 can go for as little as £5 for the Category C fixture. The most expensive ticket for the Tottenham game is £75, with a £2 booking fee for all purchases. 

Despite the expected difference in Category A and Category C prices, West Ham fans are already disgruntled at having to watch what some of the faithful regard as poor football.

West Ham won just seven of their 19 games at home last season in the top flight, scoring 25 goals.

But the club do offer incentives for fans throughout the term, particularly for juniors.

Six 'Kids for a Quid' fixtures are named in a season, as well as earmarking one game where under 16s can attend for free.

However, the prices have caused anger on social media, with football fans wondering how a side that struggled in the Premier League last season can charge supporters so much.

Adrian Leahy (@adieleahy), who voiced his concerns to Hammers co-chairman David Gold on Twitter, said: '@davidgold if you really are serious about making football affordable how come you keep raising the prices ? More & more fans priced out !'

Danny Smith (@DannyyySmith) added: 'How can west ham charge £70 to the game against spurs ? Wouldn't mind but we don't even play football! HOOOFBALL!! @davidgold.'

Andrew (@{griffina71) said: 'I took my son to watch Dortmund last year return flight and ticket cost £6 less !!!!'

Not content: West Ham endured a tough season last term, with Sam Allardyce under pressure from fans

Affordable: In contrast, Hull City are offering adult tickets for £16 for all Category C games at the KC Stadium

Venue: The KC Stadium saw Premier League football return last season, with Hull finishing 16th

With it costing £35 to become a member at Upton Park,  the ticket prices for non-members could discourage new fans from deciding to attend Hammers games at short notice.

Tottenham is a Category A fixture, alongside the visits of Arsenal, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United.

Eleven other Premier League clubs are listed as Category B fixtures, costing as much as £55 for members and £60 for non-members, while the Leicester City match at Upton Park is graded as Category C, priced £20 to £30.

Fans across the Premier League have a right to feel disgruntled about ticket prices for the highest category games.

Hull themselves charge adults £50, seniors and young adults £30, and juniors £20 for Category A games at the KC Stadium, while West Ham are not the only club charging a premium, particularly in the capital. 

On show: Hull fans will be hoping for a good start at the KC against Stoke, who will have Bojan starring 

Value for money: Hull won the same amount of games at home as West Ham last term (seven), and reached the FA Cup final, meaning they are now in this season's Europa League

To come: West Ham will hope to offer more affordable prices when they move to the Olympic Stadium in 2016

At newly-promoted QPR, 'Platinum' seats for their Category A fixtures  - against Arsenal, Man City, Man United, Chelsea, Tottenham, Liverpool and West Ham - will set non-members back £70.

Across the capital at Arsenal, the most expensive Category A ticket for non-members is £97, while seeing the big clashes at White Hart Lane will set you back £81, including their home match against West Ham. 

A ticket see Jose Mourinho's Chelsea at Stamford Bridge against top opposition costs £82.

In their penultimate campaign at Upton Park before moving to the Olympic Stadium, West Ham announced in April they would be freezing prices on season tickets for this term.

The most expensive adult season ticket is £910 for new applicants, while renewals saved £20.

But the cheapest, at £620, is still more expensive than London rivals Chelsea's least expensive option for this season, as well as the cheapest ticket at Manchester United.

Football for all: Hull City fans can enjoy affordable prices for the lesser Premier League games all year round
