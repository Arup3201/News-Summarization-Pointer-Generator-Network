President Barack Obama yesterday marked the end of the Iraq war with a tribute to the thousands of brave American troops who fought and died in the conflict.

Accompanied by his wife Michelle, the president travelled to Fort Bragg in North Carolina to address service members and their families as he brought the war to a close.

He told thousands of troops at the base: 'As your commander-in-chief and on behalf of a grateful nation, I'm proud to finally say these two words: welcome home, welcome home, welcome home.'

Tribute: Barack Obama spoke at Fort Bragg in North Carolina yesterday to mark the end of the war in Iraq

Mr Obama highlighted the
human side of the war, reflecting on the bravery and sacrifices of U.S.
forces now on their way back home.

The North Carolina base alone has seen more than 200 
deaths over nearly nine years of fighting in Iraq.

He told the crowd members, clad in fatigues and maroon berets to signify active airborne status, the total costs of the battle - more than 1.5million U.S. troops served; 30,000 were wounded and 4,500 died.

But he added that the effort had not been in vain.

'Of course, Iraq is not a perfect place,' he said. 'But we are leaving behind a sovereign, stable and self-reliant Iraq, with a representative government that was elected by its people. We are building a new partnership between our nations.'

All U.S. troops are to be out of Iraq by December 31, though Mr Obama has pledged the country will continue to help Iraq as it faces an uncertain future in a volatile region of the world.

Promises: Thousands of troops gathered to hear the president, who has vowed to work to ensure them jobs

Thanks: Mr Obama was joined by his wife Michelle, who encouraged troops to 'marry up'

Upon his arrival in Fort Bragg, 
Mr Obama met with five enlisted service members who had recently returned 
from combat. He also met with the family of a soldier killed overseas.

Mr Obama
has on several occasions addressed his reasons for ending the war, 
casting it as a promise kept after he ran for president as an anti-war 
candidate and speaking of the need to refocus U.S. attention on 
rebuilding the troubled economy at home.

4,485 Number of U.S. military members killed in Iraq

32,226 Number of U.S. service members wounded in hostile action

113,728 Number of Iraqi civilians killed in war

180 Number of Iraqi civilians killed this month

Today, his focus was principally 
on the troops and their role and his commitment to ensuring veterans get
the jobs and resources they need once they're back home.

Mr Obama told the troops at Fort Bragg: 'You stood up for America; now America must stand up for you. Our commitment to you doesn’t end when you take off the uniform.'

His appearance capped several days of Iraq-related events for the president, who hosted  Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki on Monday at the White House.

The two discussed their agenda for postwar cooperation, which Mr Obama said includes 'military-to-military ties that are no different from the ties that we have with countries throughout the region and around the world'.

On Tuesday, the president granted a series of interviews to local television stations in cities and towns with large military bases - Norfolk, Virginia; Pensacola, Florida; Colorado Springs, Colorado; and Seattle, Washington - to talk about the end of the war.

In an interview with David Alan, an anchor with ABC affiliate WVEC in Hampton Roads, Virginia, Mr Obama responded to a question about how the Iraq war had changed him.

Referring to his visits to wounded 
troops at Bethesda Naval Hospital and Walter Reed Medical Center, Mr Obama 
said, 'It’s the most sobering aspect of being president.'

Warm reception: President Obama shakes hands with troops following his speech in the plane hanger at the military base. 'I am proud to say these two words,' he had said in the address. 'Welcome home'

But, he added, 'It’s also the one thing that gives you the most pride. These young men and women make such 
extraordinary sacrifices, such dedication, with so much skill and so 
much determination. It just reminds you they’re the best we have to 
offer.'

In a separate interview, Mr Obama had previewed some of his likely themes for his Fort Bragg speech.

'We
must not forget the men and women who gave their lives, tens of 
thousands wounded, all those missed birthday parties, missed soccer 
games and missed dinners because folks were on their second or third 
deployment.

'We should not take that for granted,' the president told KOAA-TV in Colorado Spring.

'It is an extraordinary testimony to the bravery, courage, dedication and patriotism of our soldiers.'

Mr Obama's
approval rating on handling the situation in Iraq has been above 50 
per cent since last fall, and in a new Associated Press-GfK poll, has 
ticked up four points since October to 55 per cent.

Among independents, his approval rating tops 50 per cent for the first time since this spring.

It is the president's first visit to Fort
Bragg, which is home to Army Special Operations, the 18th Airborne 
Corps and the 82nd Airborne, among others.

Special Forces troops from 
Fort Bragg were among the first soldiers in Iraq during the 2003 
invasion and its paratroopers helped lead the 2007 troop increase.

North Carolina, which Obama narrowly 
won in 2008, also is an important state for the 2012 presidential 
election and will host the Democratic convention.

To underscore the political 
significance, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, one of the leading 
GOP presidential contenders, addressed an open letter to Mr Obama and sent 
it to the Fayetteville (North Carolina) Observer decrying the unemployment rate 
for veterans.

Unemployment for veterans who served after September 11, 2001, was 11.1 per cent in November, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Romney called such a statistic a 'disgrace'.

'In the face of such economic hardship, fine words welcoming veterans home are insufficient,' he wrote.

'It is time for a fundamental change of direction. If you won't or can't lead our country out of the economic morass you've deepened, then I would suggest that it's time for you to go.'
