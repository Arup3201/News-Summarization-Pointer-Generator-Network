A mother searching for the son she gave up for adoption 50 years ago has told of her grief at learning only recently that he was killed in the 1988 Lockerbie Bombing.

Carol King Eckersley, 65, from Oregon in the US, gave up her newborn son Kenneth Bissett when she was 19 years old.

But this year, following the death of her husband, she decided to try to track him down.

Grief: Carol King Eckersley, 65, from Oregon, has just discovered that the son she gave up for adoption 50 years ago was killed in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing

Her hunt led her to a remembrance 
website for the 35 students of New York's Syracuse University who were killed in 
the 1988 atrocity on which she was stunned to find a picture of young man 
with a familiar-looking face.

After checking the date of birth she realised he was her long lost son.

Mrs King Eckersley tells her story in a BBC documentary commissioned to mark the 25th anniversary of the Lockerbie bombing.

American student Ken Bissett, was one of the 270 victims of the 
Lockerbie bombing

She told the documentary: 'I looked and I said "my God, it's him".

'It was his birth date, he looked just like my dad. I looked in the mirror and I said "he looks like me".

'I called my sister and I said "but why are they only showing a part of his life? They've got December 1967 but then they've got December 21 1988. That's not right".

'And it finally dawned on me that it was right and I just said 'my God, my baby's dead'.

'I realised that it was the Lockerbie Pan Am 103 remembrance page and I said 'My God, he was on that plane'.

'Two hundred and seventy people died in that tragedy and one of those happened to be the only child I ever had.'

Ken had been returning to the US from a term spent studying in London.

He had been told he was adopted but had never met his birth mother, the daughter of a school principal who felt it would have been socially unacceptable for her to keep him.

She said: 'I gave up Ken for adoption at birth and even though I was told his name I never looked for him because I had given my word.

'There was always the hope and dream that some day there would come a knock on the door and I would open it and there would be this tall, handsome gentleman saying 'hi, I guess you're my mum'.'

Ken's adoptive parents are now both dead but left a detailed account of his childhood in Syracuse University's archives, where his mother saw a baby picture for the first time.

She said: 'I had never seen him, except wrapped up in a yellow blanket on the day we left hospital.'

She added: 'In a way, I'm going backwards...because the getting to know him makes it sharper, makes the regret deeper. He was an incredible artist. I saw comic strips that he drew when he was 11 years old.'

Atrocity: Pan-Am flight 103 from London to New York exploded above the Scottish town of Lockerbie on  December 21, 1988

Students from the University of Syracuse, read the names of the victims 
at the memorial in Lockerbie, Scotland. 35 Syracuse students flying home for Christmas were killed
 in the bombing

She described the feeling of never 
having felt like a proper parent as a result of giving up her son. She 
said: 'I have carried that stigma around. It's just a real regret that 
I'll never, in this life, see him.'

Pan Am Flight 103 exploded as it flew to New York from London on December 21, 1988.

All 259 people aboard were killed, and 11 on the ground below in the Scottish town of Lockerbie also died.

Libyan agent Abdel Basset al-Megrahi was the only person found guilty of murder.

He was convicted of killing 270 people by blowing up an American airliner over Lockerbie in December 1988.

Insult: Lockerbie bomber Abdel Baset al-Megrahi, returned to a hero's welcome in
 Libya after being released from Scottish prison on compassionate 
grounds in 2006

He was sent home early from a Scottish jail on compassionate grounds because he had terminal prostate cancer.

Ministers insisted his release was a decision taken solely by the Scottish government.

However documents have come to light 
showing that the Labour party secretly helped free Megrahi to appease 
Colonel Gaddafi, who was threatening to scupper oil contracts and 
unleash ‘holy war’ on Britain.

Living With Lockerbie will be broadcast on Monday 16 December at 22:35 GMT on BBC Scotland and on Saturday 21 December at 09:10 GMT on BBC World News.
