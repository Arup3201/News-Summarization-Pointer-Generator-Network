It was the documentary that took you behind the scenes at Manchester United and showed Ryan Giggs during his brief tenure as Manchester United boss.

And if you missed Life of Ryan: Caretaker Manager - or simply want to re-watch some of the highlights - here are three of the best clips from ITV's documentary.

In the first clip, Giggs discusses selection for the match against Hull City at Old Trafford with fellow Class of '92 legends Paul Scholes, Phil Neville and Nicky Butt.

In the second clip Giggs, who scored 168 goals in 963 appearances for United during a 23-year playing career, explains how he became emotional after his last game in charge against Southampton.

He said: 'I could feel myself getting emotional. So I get in my car and I just went, started crying, started getting really emotional and I think it was just a mixture of saying goodbye to people for maybe the last time, and the pressure that I put myself under.

'It sounds stupid now, but it's just not me, it's just not me at all.'

In the third and final clip Giggs, 40, shares an intimate moment with his family in the car after his final home match in charge against Hull.

His daughter, Liberty, reveals that she was worried with his team selection after he named youngsters Tom Lawrence and James Wilson.

And Giggs says that he was young about 10 years ago but was given his opportunity, to which she replies: 'No not 10 years ago, about 25.'
