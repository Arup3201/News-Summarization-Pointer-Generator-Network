A shocking video that appears to show Libyan rebels torturing a group of sub-Saharan African detainees has appeared on YouTube.

The footage shows a dozen or so men - suspected by Libyan rebels of fighting for the toppled government of Muammur Gaddafi last year - held in what looks like a caged zoo enclosure.

They each have their hands tied behind their back and are sat on the cage's dirty floor.

More objectionably, each has the old Libyan flag stuffed into his mouth.

Shocking: Video footage that appears to show Libyan rebels torturing a group of sub-Saharan African detainees has appeared on YouTube

Prisoners: The footage shows a dozen or so men held in what looks like a caged zoo enclosure, with their hands tied behind their backs and the former Libyan flag in their mouths

While a crowd of men gather round the enclosure jeering, their prisoners are made to hop on the spot.

The man filming the scene, who remains
 off-camera, can be heard shouting: 'Eat the flag, you dog. Patience you
 dog, patience. God is great.'

It is impossible to verify whether the video, which was leaked onto YouTube last week, is genuine and where and when it was filmed.

It has emerged as the UN this week 
said that the Libyan revolutionary brigades accused of torture still 
hold captive three-quarters of detainees from the country's civil war.

A lack of judicial police has prevented the government from taking control of more jails, the UN said on Wednesday.

Up to 6,000 detainees are estimated to
 remain in brigade facilities, while the Ministry of Justice has taken 
charge of eight detention centres holding 2,382 people.

The figures were revealed to the UN Security Council by Ian Martin, the UN special envoy for Libya.

Many of the detainees are sub-Saharan 
Africans whom their captors accused of being Gaddafi mercenaries, based 
in some cases purely on the fact that they have darker skin.

Jeered: The men are suspected of fighting for the toppled government of Muammur Gaddafi last year

Humiliating: While a crowd of men gather round the enclosure shouting, their prisoners are made to hop on the spot

The UN human rights agency and aid groups have accused the brigades of torturing detainees during Libya's nine-month civil war.

Mr Martin has urged the Ministry of Justice to accelerate the process of asserting government control over detention centres.

But he said: 'Progress continues to be complicated by insufficient numbers of judicial police.'

He added: 'We will continue to work 
closely with the authorities and to encourage them to ensure that 
inspections of known facilities are undertaken, that secret locations 
are identified and brought under government control, and that abuses are
 investigated.'

Accusations of the mistreatment and 
disappearances of suspected Gaddafi loyalists are embarrassing for 
Libya's ruling National Transitional Council, which has vowed to make a 
break with practices under Gaddafi and respect human rights.

It is also awkward for the Western powers which backed the anti-Gaddafi rebellion and helped install Libya's new leaders.

The UN Security Council meets in New York on Wednesday. It heard that up to 6,000 detainees are estimated to remain in Libyan brigade facilities

Racism? Rebel fighters hold captive a sub-Saharan African man

Out of control: Rebel fighters question another sub-Saharan as they search for Gaddafi army soldiers in Tripoli in August

Gaddafi's 42-year rule collapsed when 
his forces fled Tripoli in August, and the last of the fighting in Libya
 ended in October when he was captured and killed by rebels.

Libyan Ambassador Abdurrahman Mohamed 
Shalgham told the UN Security Council that detainees held by the 
government, including a number of former Gaddafi ministers and senior 
officers, were treated well.

Mr Shalgham said: 'However, let me say
 that there are areas where the state has not been able to control. 
There is not police or courts in those areas.

'We cannot be responsible for all 
excesses everywhere. We are against them, we object to them and we hold 
the perpetrators of such acts responsible.'

Mr Martin said that while the armed 
brigades lacked clear lines of command and coordination, they continued 
to perform important security functions often for long periods without 
payment.

He said: 'Contrary to the impression 
given by some media reports, although they seek guarantees that the 
transformation for which they have fought is securely on track, there is
 little indication that they wish to perpetuate an existence outside 
state authority.'
