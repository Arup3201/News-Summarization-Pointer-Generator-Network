A woman who escaped from Warren Jeffs' Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints cult has told how couples are banned from having sex, as she showed off images of the moment she was reunited with her children.

The revelation came after a former member of his church was able to escape from the cult along with her six children.

Ruby Jessop was just 14-years-old when
she was deemed 'sexually mature' by polygamous sect leader Jeffs and 
forced to marry her second cousin Haven Barlow.

Just days ago, she was finally reunited with her six children after the state's attorney general intervened and prevented Barlow from keeping them away from her.

Happy to be together: With the help of state police officials, Ruby Jessop was recently reunited with her six children

Freedom: Ruby Jessop spoke for the first time since she was able to run away from the control of the FLDS

She told a CNN reporter
that over the last year, husbands and wives were not allowed to have 
any form of intimate contact because of the edict.

'The only relations you could have with your husband was a handshake and no longer than three seconds,' she told CNN.

Jeffs, who heads the FLDS Church, reportedly said that 
married men and women were not to have sexual relations with one another
until he says otherwise because he does 'not want any child to be born 
in this wicked generation'.

Ruby, now 26, managed to escape from the sick and twisted sect last month and has now been granted temporary custody of the children aged from two to ten, who were being held 'hostage' by the group, her sister said.

The religious group is divided between
the sister towns of Colorado City, Arizona- where Ruby lived in a 
walled compound- and Hilldale, Utah located just across the state line.

Because
Colorado City is an incorporated township, there have been many 
complaints that the local police force- dubbed The Marshalls- are 
effectively security guards who enforce Jeffs' laws and help him 
maintain control even though he is behind bars facing child sex assault 
charges.

There is now a 
criminal probe investigating the Marshall's office as the state's 
attorney general asserts that there are many more young mothers in 
Ruby's situation who are being forced to stay in their suppressive 
relationships.

Priorities: Now Ruby is going to move on with her life and hopefully retain legal guardianship of her six young children

'What they 
do is say, "Everybody watch her so she won’t run away." Then she can’t 
leave. Women who wanted to escape have been forcibly held by the 
marshals against their will,' attorney general Tom Horne said.

Attorneys for the two towns and the Marshal’s Office adamantly denied the charges, calling Horne’s words 'inflammatory'.

Lawyer
Blake Hamilton said: 'I can’t speak for the FLDS but the bottom line is
the Marshal’s Office absolutely does not hold people against their 
will.

Earlier this month, Ruby Jessop, now 26,
managed to escape from the sick and twisted world of Warren Jeffs, who forced her to marry when she was 14, left,
and was also granted temporary custody of her six children

For Ruby, it is now 
just a matter of getting on with her life and trying to figure out how 
to set up a life for herself and her children even though she was forced
to stop going to school when she was married in ninth grade.

'I want to raise my kids, I want to be free, be able to make my own choices, to be happy,' she told CNN.

'I am very happy.'
