Conflict: Michael Gove's Constituency Party accepted money from main shareholder of Domino's Pizza

Education Secretary Michael Gove is under fire over the return of junk food into schools while also accepting donations from shareholders in Domino’s Pizza.

Mr Gove has torn up nutrition rules for school meals at the new generation of academy schools he has championed.

The standards were implemented following a campaign led by TV chef Jamie Oliver, who turned his fire on the ‘Turkey Twizzlers’ served up at many schools.

However, the new Academies have been 
allowed by the government to set their own food standards with the 
result that nutrition standards have slipped.

A survey of 108 academies found more than a third – 37 – are selling at least one of the items banned from schools under local authority control, according to the investigation by the Channel 4 Dispatches programme.

Crisps, sweets, fizzy drinks and even 
high-calorie energy drinks are available in canteens or from vending 
machines, according to the investigation. 

Concerned parents and teachers have also
reported an explosion in the number of take-away shops opening up 
around schools and taking business away from school canteens.

Some local councils have tried to stop the tactic by banning fast food chains including the likes of Domino’s pizza.

One branch of the chain recently 
opened directly opposite a secondary school in Brighton after winning an
appeal against the local council’s refusal to grant it planning 
permission.

Other local authorities have taken a 
tougher line by introducing a special planning bylaw that excludes any 
new takeaways from opening within 400 metres of a school.

In St Helens near Liverpool, Domino’s
has tried and failed repeatedly to open near a school. It has just made
a third application for the same site.

Dominating: One of the main shareholders of Domino's Pizza, whose family owns 76 branches of the company, has donated £49,541.25 to Surrey Heath Constituency Party

Meanwhile, it has emerged that Mr Gove’s constituency work has been supported by donations of almost £50,000 from shareholders in Domino’s.

Between November 2005 and December 2011,
Mr Gove’s Surrey Heath constituency party accepted £49,541.25 from 
Moonpal Singh Grewal - the largest single shareholder in Domino’s in the
UK - or companies owned by him.

The businessman, whose family owns 76 Domino’s outlets,  is also chairman of Mr Gove’s constituency party.

In addition, Mr Gove’s local office 
accepted  £6,805 from Surinder Kandola, who is the owner of 22 Domino’s 
Pizza franchises, between June 2005 and November 2006.

The donations have not been denied by Mr Gove and there is no suggestion that these were hidden or in any way improper.

However, Jamie Oliver, who fears his good work on school meals is at serious risk, said: ‘I think it proves that there’s been too many occasions where such an important role has been represented by someone who is seemingly lack of basic common sense.

‘You have to be very careful about who gives you money, because this is sounding very much like America now, where Domino’s actually deliver a very large percentage of the school food service.

‘So their sister company over the pond is making a lot of money out of school kids and they share lots of information - and they know where growth is.’

Labour MP, Stephen Pound, suggested the donations suggested the education secretary is not independent on the issue of children’s health and diet.

He told the programme: ‘He who pays the piper calls the tune.'

And if the money for Surrey Heath constituency is coming via the deep fat fryer, then how can Michael Gove possibly – possibly –be even handed about this?’

Domino’s Pizza denied actively seeking sites near schools.

It said: ‘We are a responsible retailer and have always offered to work with local authority planning officers, where there are particular concerns, for example through voluntary conditions such as closing the store to take away customers during lunch times, and at the end of the school day.’

Mr Gove has no role in deciding planning policy and cannot dictate where take-aways are opened. He said he was pleased to have the support of the Asian businessmen linked to Domino’s.

In respect of Moonpal Singh, he said: ‘I am proud to have one of Britain’s most successful Asian entrepreneurs supporting my local party and contributing to public life.’

He said Mr Kandola was ‘another highly successful Asian businessman who has generated jobs and opportunities for others’.

Mr Gove insisted the responsibility for food and nutrition standards lies with those in charge of the academy schools and, where schools are run by councils, the local authorities.
