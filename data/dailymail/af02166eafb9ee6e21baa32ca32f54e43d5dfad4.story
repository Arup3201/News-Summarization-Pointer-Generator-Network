As many as ten cats have been discovered dead or dying on the same street after apparently being poisoned, sparking fears from neighbours that a pet killer is on the loose.

RSPCA officers have launched an investigation after a number of cats were discovered with similar symptoms, consistent with poisoning, in the residential street in Norwich.

Neighbours have described the cats as suffering from severe stomach upsets and frothing vomit, and worry that the animals have been deliberately poisoned.

Tracy Marrison had at first thought that her pet cat Pilchard, which she and partner Daniel Graves had bought for their son Jake, had suffered a stroke due to old age.

But then two cats belonging to her neighbour Leanne Dye were found dead on the same day, having also been foaming at the mouth. 

'He was like my oldest boy’s best friend,' she told the Eastern Daily Press. 'He is devastated. For anyone to do that to someone’s family pet, it’s cruel and wicked.' 

Mrs Dye said that her black and white cat Daisy and a tabby called Shadow were both found dead on January 13.

'My neighbour found one of my cats dead in her greenhouse and she came to let me know,' she said.

'I called for the other one but she didn't show up and we found her body in the shed later that same day.

Leo Davies, five,  with his family cat Bruce - who had to be put to sleep after was found having seizures and foaming at the mouth

'Shadow and Daisy were both found with their eyes open and foaming at the mouth surrounded by faeces.

'It was devastating.'

The mother-of-four added: 'One of our neighbours found their new kitten in the same state.

'It was still barely alive so they took it to the vet and it had to be put to sleep.

'I'd had Daisy for nearly eight years and Shadow was her daughter.

'It's been so upsetting - my four kids are devastated.'

Another black and white elderly male cat called Pilchards also died after being struck down.

While horrified Zoe Davies found her 11-month-old kitten Bruce having seizures and foaming at the mouth on January 23. He had to be taken to the vets and put to sleep - to the distress of Mrs Davies's five-year-old son Leo.

RSPCA officers have been told that as many as ten cats in this single street have been poisoned

Another stray cat which had been adopted by one neighbour was found dead on his doorstep. 

Owners say they have had to pay around £200 vet bills as they deal with the loss of their pets.

Vets told some families that their cats may be been poisoned by anti-freeze. 

RSPCA inspector Ben Kirby called on owners to contact their vet if there were any signs of poisoning, such as:

* depression

* lack of appetite

* vomiting

* diarrhoea

* breathing difficulties

* appearing drunk and uncoordinated

* twitching

* seizures

The RSPCA has been told that as many as ten cats have died in the same street. 

RSPCA inspector Ben Kirby said: 'This is highly distressing and we urge anyone with any information about this to call us.

'It is difficult to know for sure what happened and how these poor cats were poisoned.

'But it's extremely concerning that so many animals died in this horrible way in such a short space of time in just one street.

'Poisoning causes a lot of pain and distress and is often fatal.

'It is likely all these cats suffered a lot before they died.'

Mr Kirby warned that anyone who poisoned an animal could get a £20,000 fine and/or six months in prison under the Animal Welfare Act.

'We do not know for sure what the cause of the poisonings was,' he said.

'But we'd urge people to be careful when using poisonous substances - to clear up any spills and to store and discard them safely.

'There is also the worrying possibility that someone did this deliberately so if anyone has seen anything suspicious please contact us.'

Police told MailOnline that officers were aware of the poisoning complaints, but as yet had no evidence to suggest what might have led to the cats' deaths.
