The ice bucket challenge has caused a run on freezer cabinets with supermarkets running out of ice as the online trend sweeps Britain.

Freezer shelves at many stores are lying empty after shoppers rushed to buy ice in order to take part in the fundraising dare in aid of a Motor Neurone Disease charity. 

Supermarkets in Portsmouth, Fareham, and Bursledon, Hampshire, are among the many that have been drained of ice reserves following a flood of sales.

Tina McDonough, 58, a customer sales assistant at the Co-operative said staff had to turn people 'of all ages' away because they ran out of ice.

'We ran out at the weekend and had to turn a few people away of all ages,' said Ms McDonough, from Portsmouth.

'It was the rainy so nobody was having Pimm's o'clock - it was definitely to do with the Ice Bucket Challenge.'

Supermarkets have been ordering in extra supplies of ice to meet the demand, sparked by the campaign going viral on social media.

A spokesman for Tesco in Portsmouth said: 'There has been a massive drive in sales of ice for the store.

'Normally in summer we sell two or three cases a day and in each case there are about six bags.

'But at the moment we're moving 20 cases in a few days.

'A lot of the time it has been young customers buying them to do the ice bucket challenge.'

A Tesco branch in South Shields, Tyneside, has also admitted running out of ice.

'We sold out on Saturday and we nearly did on Sunday as well,' said Daniel Smith, duty manager of the Simonside Tesco.

'We don't usually sell so much ice at this time of year - it's usually only this popular when big events like the World Cup are on.

'It seems like everyone is taking part in the challenge and getting behind the charity to raise money and quite a few of our staff have taken part too.

'It's great to see so many people taking part, but before the next big craze, we'd love a bit of warning so we can stock up on whatever it is people need.'

Tesco has donated the profits from its ice cube sales to charity, and challenged other supermarkets to do the same after selling more than 36 million individual ice cubes over the last week.

So far the retailer has donated £20,000 to the Motor Neurone Disease Association and nominated competitors Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons to follow suit. 

Tesco community director Greg Sage said: 'The ice bucket challenge has done an amazing job of raising awareness of motor neurone disease. An incredible number of people all over the world have taken part, including a huge number of Tesco colleagues.

'We've seen a big increase in sales of bags of ice as a direct result of this phenomenon, and we want the Motor Neurone Disease (MND) Association to be the ones to benefit. That's why today we've pledged to donate the extra profits we make to them, and we nominate Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons to do the same.'

A spokesman from a Sainsbury's branch in Fareham, Hampshire, said sales had doubled from usual hot summer figures as shoppers dashed to buy 'excessive' quantities of ice.

Linda Langdon, the branch's public relations ambassador, said: 'We have been selling excessive amounts of ice and sold 60 bags in one shop in the space of about five hours.

'Compared to normal, it's double the amount we would have sold over the hot summer period.'

A spokesman for Morrisons said customers struggling to find ice for their challenges can get a helping hand from the chain's fishmongers.

'Hundreds of our colleagues have also been doing the Ice Bucket Challenge in support of our charity partner, Sue Ryder,' she said. 

'They care for people with long term conditions including MND at the end of their lives. So far this year we have raised almost £1m to support their fabulous work across the UK.

'If customers would also like to help by doing their own Ice Bucket Challenge, they don’t need to pay for ice – they can get it for free from our fishmongers, just ask.'

The ice bucket challenge involves dumping iced water on someone's head before the participant nominates another person to have a go.

More than £2.7million has been raised for the Motor Neurone Disease Association so far and the figure is rising daily as more people are nominated.

Sally Light, chief executive of the MND Association, said: 'The ice bucket challenge is an amazing and unprecedented opportunity to raise awareness of what is a devastating terminal disease.'

The charity does not have figures on how many people are undertaking the challenge and donating per day, but since August 10 when the charity's ice bucket JustGiving page was set up 546,553 people have donated through the site, an average of more than 30,000 a day, with thousands more using the text number. 

In the last two weeks, MND Association has also received more than 17,000 new likes on Facebook and 6,000 new followers on Twitter.

On Tuesday the charity website was visited by 153,000 people, compared with the 1,400 who visit on an average day.

However, a poll of 1,528 British adults has found that more than half of those who undertook the challenge did not donate to charity.

Around half of those quizzed by VoucherCodesPro said they had done the challenge, but 53per cent admitted they had not donated. 

According to The Independent, more than one in three people said they had taken part solely to get attention on social media, and one in ten said they had only done the challenge as they felt pressure to do so having been nominated.

Just 16 per cent said they had given between £1 and £3 to charity, and 3 per cent gave more than £10.

'Maybe not everyone who has done the Ice Bucket Challenge has donated, but a huge number have,' said Douglas Graham, Director of Fundraising for the MND Association.

'Last year in total we received 161,000 donations and in the last week alone we have had more than half a million donations adding up to around £3 million and that’s still rising.

'And while some people will just throw the water over their head we know thousands have come on our website or social media channels and found out about ALS or MND. As a relatively rare disease raising awareness is almost as important as raising funds, so we couldn’t be more pleased.' 

In the U.S., where the challenge originated, challengers have been urged to support the ALS Association, which supports those living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease - a type of motor neurone disease.

ALS is used as the umbrella term for the disease in the U.S., whereas in Britain it is MND. 

Since the end of July, the ALS Association, a sister charity to the Motor Neurone Disease Association, has received $94.3million (around £56.8million) in donations compared to $2.7million (£1.6million) during the same time period last year. 

A spokesman said: 'These donations have come from existing donors and 2.1 million new donors. 

'The ALS Association is tremendously thankful for all of the generous support and awareness that this summer phenomenon has generated for the cause.'
