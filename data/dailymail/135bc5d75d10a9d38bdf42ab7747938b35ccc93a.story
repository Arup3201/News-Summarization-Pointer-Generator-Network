Kick off your shoes and get out the surfboards... because Britain could be hotter than Hawaii on Thursday with temperatures as high as 19.7C (67.4F).

This would match the record for the month, set on February 13, 1988, in London, according to the Met Office.

As the UK basks in two days of unseasonable warmth after a six-week cold snap, Honolulu is expected to hit a mere 19C (66F).

London, Cambridge,
Lincolnshire and North Wales are the regions most likely to benefit from the milder conditions.

Regent's Park in London was a winter 
wonderland last week. But by Thursday, temperatures could beat the record-breaking February high of 19.7C (67.4F)

London, Cambridge, Lincolnshire and North Wales could be warmer than Honolulu later this week

Meteorologist Jim Dale, from British 
Weather Services, said: 'It will be exceptionally warm for us - it's a mile 
from what we've been having of late.'

Mr Dale said there is a one in seven chance the February record will be broken.

WEDNESDAY: Dry and cloudy for a time in south-east 
England, but outbreaks of rain already in the north and west will spread
south-eastwards through the day. The rain will be heavy in places, but 
particularly in western Scotland, Northern Ireland and over high ground 
in England and Wales. A blustery day with strong gusts in places. 
Remaining mild. Max temp: 15C (59F)

THURSDAY: Very mild in places and 
remaining windy. It will be mostly cloudy with outbreaks of rain in 
northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. However, it will become
increasingly dry across much of Wales and southern parts of England, 
with a few sunny spells developing, particularly further east. Max temp 19.7C (67.4F)

FRIDAY: Some
rain in northwest, slowly sinking south through Friday, 
with temperatures returning nearer to normal. Max temp 14C (57F).

And if Britain does break the 19.7C barrier, it will be the second 
time in five months that such a record has been smashed.

Last October, 
Gravesend in Kent reached 29.9C.

According to the Met Office, temperatures towards the end of the week are more likely to reach 17C (63C).

This is still almost treble the average for this time of year, which is around 6C (43F).

It would also bring the British weather to levels currently seen in Bahrain and Cairo.

However, by the weekend, forecasters predict rain and lower temperatures will return.

Martin Young, chief forecaster at the
Met Office, said: 'There will be much milder conditions.

'Temperatures are expected to get into double figures in many areas as we 
see a return to unsettled conditions with strong winds and heavy rain 
in places.'

British Weather Services, established in 1987, is a group of leading consultant meteorologists, including former BBC weatherman John Kettley.

Met Office needs supercomputers, say MPs

The Met
Office would be able to issue more confident severe weather warnings and
increase its accuracy on long-term forecasts if it had more powerful
supercomputers, a group of MPs has said.

A report
from the Commons Science and Technology Committee concluded the national
forecaster was being 'held back by insufficient supercomputing
capacity' but acknowledged that affordability was an issue.

The
politicians agreed with the findings of a 2010 review which said a 'step-change' in favour of the new technology was necessary to
improve the accuracy of short and long-range forecasts and climate predictions.

Met officials said they would have been able to predict more accurate forecasts in relation to the snowstorms in the South of England in February 2009 and the Cumbrian floods (above) in November 2009 if the organisation had a greater supercomputer capacity

The report
said: 'It is of great concern to us that scientific advances in weather
forecasting and the associated public benefits (particularly in regard to severe
weather warnings) are ready and waiting but are being held back by insufficient
supercomputing capacity.

'We
echo the recent conclusions of the Government Chief Scientific Adviser and
others, that a step-change in supercomputing capacity is required. We
acknowledge, however, that affordability is an issue.'

The Met
Office believes there would be 'a very rapid' 10-1 return on
investment in the computers, which are built to make billions of mathematical
calculations as quickly as possible.

Officials
at the organisation said it would have been able to predict more accurate
forecasts in relation to the snowstorms in the South of England in February
2009 and the Cumbrian floods in November 2009 if it had a greater supercomputer
capacity.

The report
recommended the Met Office, which provides weather data to the Government and
the Armed Forces, develops a ten-year strategy for supercomputing resources.
