Patrick Vieira walked his Manchester City players off the pitch in the middle of a game after Under-21 midfielder Seko Fofana was allegedly the victim of racial abuse during a pre-season match in Croatia on Tuesday. 

Vieira's Elite Development Side are currently on a 10-day pre-season training camp in Novigrad and they demanded that the match against HNK Rijeka was postponed after an opposing player allegedly racially insulted Fofana, a 19-year-old Frenchman.

Vieira entered the field to talk to the referee before taking his players off the pitch.

Youngster: Fofana in action for Manchester City's youth team against Chelsea

Fofana was sent off by the 
referee after being seen to kick out at his opponent but the club have 
revealed their belief that Fofana, usually a level-headed young man, was
 racially abused moments before he lashed out. The incident took place 
just before the half-time break.

The decision to postpone the match was a unilateral one taken by the management staff present and Vieira is understood to be unequivocal in his backing of the young player, who is said to have been left deeply distressed by the incident.

A club statement on Tuesday evening read: 'Manchester City's EDS U21 game with HNK Rijeka has today been cancelled due to an alleged incident of racial abuse toward the Club's young midfielder, Seko Fofana by a member of the opposing team.

'Following an alleged incident in the latter stages of the first half of the game, being played in Novigrad, Croatia, a decision was taken by the management staff to withdraw the City team from the field of play and cancel the game.

'Club representatives in Croatia and in Manchester are liaising with officials, the match organisers and the Croatian Football Association to pursue this matter further.'

HNK Rijeka, however, appear to have distanced themselves from speculation that one of their players made racist comments towards Fofana.

A statement on their website read: 'Manchester City coach Patrick Vieira entered the field, something was discussed with the referee, and then to the amazement of a well-filled stadium he took his team off the pitch. What are the reasons? They are known only to him.'

City are incensed after this became the fourth case of alleged racist abuse directed towards one of their players in the last two years and privately they are furious that more is not being done to tackle backwards atttitudes on the continent.

Making his point: Patrick Vieira was integral to Manchester City's players development

Stepping in: After the incident, Man City coach Patrick Vieira stepped in to have the game cancelled

Only in March, fellow EDS player Devante Cole, the son of former Manchester United player Andrew, was the victim of racial abuse during a UEFA Youth League match at Atletico Madrid.

The player was targeted by players and supporters, and is understood to have even be spat at as he left the field. Even a tannoy announcement made during the game did not stem the tide of bile aimed at Cole.

UEFA's response was a fine of just €10,000 euros and a partial closure of their youth stadium for a future game.

It also follows the alleged monkey chants by CSKA Moscow supporters directed towards Yaya Toure in last season's Champions League clash in Russia and the same kind of alleged derogatory noises aimed at Mario Balotelli during a Europa League match against Porto in 2012.

Porto were fined only £16,700 for the behaviour of their supporters while CSKA were punished with only a partial closure of their stadium.
