President Barack Obama is moving ahead with his push to close the Guantanamo Bay prison despite the uproar over the exchange of five Taliban prisoners for a captured American soldier, an administration official said Thursday.

The Periodic Review Board has determined that more former 'forever prisoners,' including one who says he has been reformed by practicing yoga and another who was a bodyguard for Bin Laden but now wants to start a 'milk and honey farm' are fit for release to their homelands or repatriation.

Ghaleb Nasser al Bihani, 35, told a 
parole board in April that he had read the biographies of Dr Martin 
Luther King Jr and the Dalai Lama and aspired to live 'an ordinary 
life.'

Intelligence compiled for the board described Bihani, a Yemeni, as a troublemaker in the prison who showed 'ill intentions to the U.S.' and was 'almost certainly' a trained former member of al-Qaeda whose own brothers were jihadists with the group, reports the Miami Herald.

His lawyer says that he was only an assistant cook for a group that was affiliated with the Taliban and no longer exists.

He suffers diabetes, says the lawyer, and needs medical care.

Bihani now practices yoga and reads self-help books, and wants to start a family when he is released, he told the board. He plans to distance himself from family members who are known to be extremists.

Mahmud Abd al Mujahid, 33, another Yemeni, has also been cleared for transfer.

According to the New York Post, his lawyer described the suspected Osama bin Laden bodyguard as 'a peacemaker' who 'requires no rehabilitation' when he is returned to Yemen.

A detainee who was called as a character witness told the board that Mujahid wants to start a milk and honey farm.

Mujahid told the board that as a child, 'we were taught politeness, respect and human being [sic].'

Ali Ahmad al-Razihi, 33, is suspected of having been part of what U.S. intelligence officials called the 'Dirty 30' security detail around bin Laden, a founder of al Qaeda who was killed in 2011 by U.S. forces in Pakistan.

He told the board that he plans to focus on returning to Yemen, marrying and helping with the family fruit and vegetable business.

His representative described him as 'a peaceful man,' and the board cited his 'positive attitude,' but a profile by the Defense Department said he has been uncooperative and has avoided interviews since 2010.

He was captured in 2001 while he fled bin Laden's hideout in Tora Bora, Afghanistan. In 2010, a parole board recommended he remain in prison.

The White House official said a 'significant number' of prisoners are on their way toward release, but he declined to say precisely how many or when they would leave Guantanamo. The remarks were made on condition of anonymity amid fierce criticism in Congress over the decision to swap the five Taliban for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl.

The U.S. holds 149 men at Guantanamo. Most have been there without charge since the detention center opened in January 2002 to hold prisoners suspected of links to al-Qaida or the Taliban.

Among the total are 78 who have been cleared for transfer to their homeland or repatriation to another country if the U.S. can get required security assurances.

Obama came into office pledging to close the detention center within a year but was thwarted by Congress, which adopted restrictions on transfers abroad and a ban on transferring prisoners to the United States for any reason.

Last year, Congress eased the restrictions on transfers abroad but left in place a 30-day notice requirement that the Obama administration chose to skip in exchange for rescuing Bergdahl from captivity after five years.

Several Republicans in Congress are determined to keep Guantanamo open and bar Obama from transferring any prisoners.

Senator Kelly Ayotte, a Republican from New Hampshire who is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a chief proponent of keeping the prison operational, said the Bergdahl swap represents a 'real-case example' that she and other lawmakers can use in arguing for tougher restrictions on Guantanamo detainees.

She said Bergdahl's case highlights 'the risk that we take when we're transferring high-risk detainees to third-party nationals that we can't necessarily account for their security and ability to get back into the fight.'

Another member of the committee, Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, has said he will introduce legislation next week to prohibit any transfers from Guantanamo until Congress learns more about the Bergdahl case.
