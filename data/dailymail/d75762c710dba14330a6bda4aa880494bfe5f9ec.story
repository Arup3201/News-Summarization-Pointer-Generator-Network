The heroin addict who continued to abuse drugs after having a life-saving heart transplant is now on the waiting list for another one, his family have revealed.

Drug dealer Derek Gates, 38, whose heart problems were caused by years of addiction, may get a second heart transplant despite refusing to kick his habit.

For his first operation, Gates was fast-tracked up the waiting list, leapfrogging scores of other needy patients with heart disease. Many people wait for up to a year for the £40,000 surgery, but Gates was found a donor in just three weeks, from a woman who had died in a car crash.

Second chance: Heart transplant survivor Derek Gates has been jailed after abusing heroin and other drugs for years. Mr Gates, 38, admitted possessing heroin and producing cannabis after his house was raided by officers last month

But shortly after being given a second chance at life, Gates was taking heroin – a drug known to weaken the cardiovascular system – and even became a dealer.

On Monday he was jailed for 18 months for drug possession after police found £430 worth of heroin in his flat in Bridlington, East Yorkshire.

But the case sparked outrage after Gates’s barrister told Hull Crown Court that his first heart had been damaged by drug abuse.

Yesterday his family said he was back on the waiting list because the lifespan of his donor organ was nearing an end – but that he did not even deserve the first one.

His sister Kathleen, 42, said: ‘I can understand why people are angry. He doesn’t deserve the one he’s got, let alone another one.’

His brother, who asked not to be named, added: ‘He’s scum. They should have given the heart to someone who deserved it.

‘Our father was a decent man and we all had a good upbringing. He’d turn in his grave if he knew what Derek was doing now.’

There
are currently 231 people who need a heart transplant. Patients can wait
anything from a few weeks to a year for a suitable donor, but 20 per 
cent of people die while on the waiting list.

Gates’s
partner Melanie Lock, 40, said: ‘He’s supposed to get 15 years of life 
with the heart. It’s been 13 and a half so far, so that time is nearing 
an end.

‘I think he would get another heart 
after that. He’d be nervous about going in for the operation though – 
he’s not sure if he wants to go through it all again.’

Miss
Lock, who has been in an on-off relationship with Gates for almost 20 
years, said he had the heart transplant in 2000 after being diagnosed 
with cardiomyopathy  at the age of 24. She added:

‘He was so ill that he would have died without the transplant. It was really touch and go. 

'Derek recovered really fast. When he came round all he wanted to do was watch a DVD. He was happy that he was still here.’

After his operation, he stayed in hospital in Sheffield for two weeks before being cared for in a special rehabilitation flat.

He
has claimed benefits ever since, although he was said to have a 
reputation in the town as a drug dealer, and was able to make up to £750
a day.

The couple have
a son, 17-year-old Royd, and are expecting another child in June, when 
Gates, who has 32 previous convictions, may be released on parole.

Miss Lock added: ‘I’ve spoken to Derek and he is fuming about all the abuse he’s getting. People are saying he didn’t deserve the heart.

‘I’d like to tell them, don’t say something if you’re not in that situation. I hope that he will come out of prison and help to raise these children and won’t go back to drugs. He’s a great dad.’

A spokesman for NHS Blood and Transplant, which is responsible for organ donations, said it could not comment on individual cases.

However, he added: ‘In circumstances where a patient is in need of a transplant because of substance abuse, our guidelines recommend patients adhere to strict conditions and are assessed by a panel, including addiction experts, before they can be accepted on to the transplant list.

‘Patients are only listed for a transplant if the operation will have a satisfactory outcome, and this includes compliance and avoidance of drug use.’
