A new report by the Southern Poverty Law Center found that a terrorist attack or foiled encounter has taken place every 34 days in the US since 2009

While recent attacks in Paris and Sydney dominate the headlines, a new report has found that domestic terrorism by 'lone wolf' assailants is on the rise.

A terrorist attack or foiled encounter has taken place, on average, every 34 days in the US since 2009, according to a study released today by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

The watchdog group urged the government to pay more attention to domestic terrorist attacks, citing 63 victims in six years from plots carried out by American extremists, including right-wing radicals and homegrown jihadists. 

Mark Potok, the study's editor, said the report was not 'trying to diminish the very real jihadist threat' abroad, but rather implored the government to take notice of the dangers at home as well, according to Yahoo! News. 

'We have known since Timothy McVeigh murdered 168 people in Oklahoma City in 1995 that there is a very real and very substantial threat in terms of terrorism from our fellow Americans,' he said. 

The concept of the 'lone wolf', defined as a person who carries out a terrorist attack entirely on his own, gained popularity in the 1980s from a violent member of the Ku Klux Klan. 

Louis Beam advocated for radicals to stop acting together in large groups - which only made it easier for them to get caught - and instead called for 'lone wolf action or leaderless resistance' that involved no more than six men.

The SPLC study found that 74 per cent of the 63 incidents examined from April 1, 2009, through Feburary 1, 2015, were carried out or planned by a single person.

And 90 per cent of the incidents were just the work of one or two people. 

According to the report, lone wolf's are all the more dangerous because often nobody else knows about their plan for violence. 

This is because homegrown terrorists are hiding themselves 'in the anonymity and safety of the Internet', Potok said. 

Chilling: One of the incidents included in the study were the murder of two police officers and a bystander by Jerad (left) and Amanda Miller (right), a married couple with extreme anti-government views, in Las Vegas 

The 2012 massacre of six people at a Wisconsin Sikh temple by a neo-Nazi, and the murder of two police officers and a bystander last summer by a Las Vegas couple with anti-government views, were two of the incidents included in the study.

Following the recent attacks in Sydney and Paris, the White House will hold a summit next week to discuss countering violent extremism.

But Potok has concerns the meeting will focus too heavily 'on the threat of Islamist terrorism'.  

'The government, at least in our view, has fallen down in many ways with respect to dealing with domestic terrorism' he said.  

National Security Council spokesman Ned Price said the summit will not focus 'on any particular religion, ideology or political movement,' he wrote in an email to Yahoo News. 

He said the summit will 'address contemporary challenges' and attempt to 'draw lessons that are applicable to the full spectrum of violent extremists'. 

A task force dedicated to domestic terrorism was created after the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, but it disbanded not long after the September 11 terrorist attacks. 

The Department of Homeland Security's team dedicated to non-Islamic domestic terrorism similarly fell apart in 2009 after it was heavily criticized for a report stating that right-wing radicalism grew exponentially following the election of Barack Obama to office in 2009.  

Attorney General Eric Holder announced last summer that the task force that disintegrated in 2001 would be revived, although the SPLC has noted that a meeting has yet to be held. 

The report found that there were two main motivations fueling domestic terrorism. 

Almost half of the attacks in the last six years were fueled by anti-government radicals, whereas 51 per cent of the incidents were inspired by ideologies 'of hate', including both white supremacy and radical Islamism.

But after the recent attacks in Paris and Sydney, combined with the ongoing brutality of ISIS, Potok said Muslims in America are 'clearly under fire'. 

This week three young American-born Muslim students in North Carolina were brutally executed by their neighbor Craig Stephen Hicks.   

Although the most recent shooting in Chapel Hill has yet to be ruled a hate crime - police believe it was caused by a parking dispute - Potok said he believes the country will only continue to see similar violence.

'It is very likely to get worse before it gets better.'
