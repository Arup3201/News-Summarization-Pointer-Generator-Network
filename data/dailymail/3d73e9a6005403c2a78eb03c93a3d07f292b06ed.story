A woman is believed to have been murdered in a hotel room on New Year’s Eve.

The body of a 26-year-old Asian woman was found at Grand Chancellor Hotel in Adelaide by staff after they noticed her room had been flooded.

Staff in the city centre hotel found the woman's body on Thursday morning after going to the 12th floor room to investigate water running into the hallway and the room below.

‘There were obvious signs of violence which made it quite obvious there was a murder,’ Detective Inspector Greg Hutchins said.

Police have taken away two cars they say belong to ‘associates’ of the woman.

The woman from Sydney had been in Adelaide for three or four days.

Det Insp Hutchins said while police have yet to establish why she was in Adelaide, they are investigating the possibility she was a sex worker.

‘We don't know why this person was the victim of murder. We're still establishing what she was doing in Adelaide,’ he said.

Police suspect the woman was killed in the last 12-16 hours but are still carrying out investigations

‘It's just a possibility that she could have been working in that industry but it's clearly something we need to chase up and identify.’

Police suspect she was killed in the last 12-16 hours. 

'I suspect it would take some time for the water to get to the room below but whether we are talking about half an hour or 12 hours I don’t know,' Insp Hutchins said, Adelaide Now reported. 

Police do not have any suspects and Major Crime investigators remain at the scene and will be reviewing CCTV footage.
