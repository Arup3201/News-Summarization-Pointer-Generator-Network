Outraged: Aristocrat fashion designer and Titanic survivor Lucy Duff-Gordon's angry letter about her mistreatment at the hands of British investigators and tabloids is hitting the auction block

A wealthy survivor of the Titanic sinking complains in a letter being auctioned this month of 'disgraceful' treatment in the press during a British inquiry into the disaster.

The May 1912 letter by aristocratic fashion designer Lady Lucile Duff-Gordon is being offered by RR Auction of Boston. 

Duff-Gordon and her husband were among a dozen people who survived in a lifeboat built for 40.

Tabloids dubbed it the 'Money Boat' because scuttlebutt had it that her husband bribed the crew to row away from the sinking ship faster. 

In a private letter to a friend, Lady Duff-Gordon writes, 'We didn't seem to have done the right thing in being saved at all! Isn't it disgraceful.'

According to RR Auction, the letter was composed the couple's Knightsbridge resident as a British Wreck Commissioner's inquiry into the accident was taking place.

The couple were the only two passengers called to testify at the inquiry.

In spite of their grilling in the press, the Duff-Gordons were cleared by the British Wreck Commissioner's inquiry, which found only that more passengers may have been saved had the lifeboat turned around.

'Correspondence from prominent passengers with such exceptional Titanic content is rarely encountered—especially written so soon after the tragedy,' said Bobby Livingston, Executive VP at RR Auction.  

While little-known outside of fashion historian circles, Lady Duff-Gordon’s contributions to the fashion industry far exceed her limited notoriety.

Lucile was not simply just a purveyor of hyper feminine clothes. It was a game-changer in the realms of fashion business practices, as well as marketing. Lady Duff-Gordon (who often went by Lucile, professionally) created the first-ever designer collaboration with a two-season run for Sears, Roebuck & Co.

Appalled: The letter from Duff-Gordon reveals her anger over presumptions she and her wealthy husband paid off crew members to quickly row away from the sinking Titanic. She was rescued in a lifeboat that held 12 people despite being built for 40

'We didn't seem to have done the right thing in being saved at all! Isn't it disgraceful,' she tells a friend in the strongly worded May 1912 letter

She was also one of the first designers to stage runway shows, release a branded perfume, and issue coupons in magazines as a way to draw customers into her handful of international boutiques.

Lucile was founded in 1893 according to Randy Bryan Bigham, author of the self-published book Lucile- Her Life by Design, as a way to support herself in the aftermath of her first marriage.

Lady Duff-Gordon built Lucile’s name on attention-grabbing antics. She was the first designer to utilize celebrity culture as a method for attracting public recognition. Lady Duff-Gordon’s sister, the novelist and film producer Elinor Glyn, offered the designer an inside track to famous entertainers and the more renowned members of the Ziegfeld Follies, whom she dressed in a time when performers were still considered painted lady-type figures. 

Successful: Despite the shrill tone the Lady strikes in her letter, Lucy was a shrewd and cunning business woman who gained renown in the fashion world in her day

Lady Duff-Gordon’s many publicity stunts earned her label a certain sense of notoriety—one which was tempered by her lofty social title, which she earned in her second marriage to Scottish landowner and Olympic fencer Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon.

‘How she presented herself went a long way in the business, the whole idea that she was aristocratic allowed her to be so suggestive,’ said Beth Dincuff, a fashion history professor at Parsons, The New School for Design.

Lady Duff-Gordon’s influence hit its peak in the Belle Époque era, a time when ruffled extravagance was de rigeuer among the world’s wealthy. But when the First World War hit, a need for simplified elegance suddenly arose.

Tasked with maintaining her relevance, Lucile decided to expand her potential reach to the everyday person.

In 1916, two years after the war began, Lady Duff-Gordon teamed up with then mail order-only business Sears, Roebuck & Co. on a small co-opted collection. The designs--which included daywear, special occasion items, outerwear, and even suits--were ‘very close to her couture aesthetic, super feminine with lots of ribbons, lots of layers, lots of lace, and sumptuous material like velvets, chiffon, and silks,’ said Calahan.

With inflation, the garments (priced from $25 to $40), would cost between $500 and $900, which Calahan says is ‘very comparable to the cost of high-end ready-to-wear today.’

The designs, which were still custom-tailored (customers had to fill out forms with their full-body measurements), were remarkably less expensive than Lucile’s couture pieces that, with inflation, would run in the ballpark of $5,000.

Lucile continued to design into the Twenties, but ‘she didn’t groom a successor, at that time once a designer would pass away the whole business would close. Those who had diversified later on, like Chanel, made sure there was someone to take over the business,’ Dincuff added.

The house of Lucile entirely dissolved by 1933, and lay dormant until 2005 when her great-great granddaughter decided to reinvigorate the house for the modern era. 

Moneyboat: Despite their lifeboat being fit for 40, the Duff-Gordons' only held 12 survivors after the wreck. That, paired with speculation that Lucy's husband bribed crew members to speed away without letting the boat fill, won Titanic lifeboat No. 1 the nickname Moneyboat in the press
