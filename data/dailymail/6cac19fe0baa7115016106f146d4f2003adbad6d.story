Chief Coroner dismissed excuse because she'd been there before

Lindsay tweeted that she was 'sorry for confusion' and was stressed

She turned up in an $80,000 Porsche

Lindsay intends to arrive on time to the morgue later today to report for her community service

This is the moment Lindsay Lohan cruised up to her community service at a morgue 40 minutes late.

Despite the gravity of her ongoing legal problems, the actress made a splashy entrance as she pulled into the LA County Morgue's car park in a $80,000 Porsche Panamera, before being turned away due to her tardiness.

And after finding herself with her day unexpectedly free, Lohan decided to put her time to good use by attending a last minute therapy session.

Lindsay posted on Twitter: 'With all of 
the stress and pressure from yesterday and today, I've never been so 
happy to go to therapy!!!! Also, I'm sorry for the confusion that I may 
of caused to those at the Coroner's office. Won't happen again, now I 
know where to go! Thank you for your help.'

Although the LA Coroner's spokesman said Lohan was 40 minutes late to her 8am appointment, she claimed she was 'approximately 20 minutes late'.

But after her 'confusion' over what entrance to use on Thursday, her publicist insisted the actress would report to the morgue on time later today.

Her publicist Steven Honig said: 'Lindsay arrived at the 
morgue approximately 20 minutes late and will be returning for 
orientation tomorrow.

'Her lateness was due to a combination 
of not knowing what entrance to go through and confusion caused by the 
media waiting for her arrival.

Well the rest of the day is free now... Lindsay Lohan made use of her free time by going to the dentist to get her teeth whitened

'Lindsay 
spoke with the supervisors at the morgue. They showed her how to get in,
 and everything is all cleared up.'

Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter, 
however, is unconvinced by Lohan's excuse, telling reporters that she 
has been to the morgue before so should have known where to go. And she may not just be able to turn up today without the judge's permission.

Winter added: 'Ms. Lohan has to have permission from the probation department and/or 
the judge, that she can come back.

'I haven't heard from the probation 
department or the judge about whether or not Ms. Lohan will be allowed 
to come back.'

However, Lindsay still believes she is on track. 'She is going to 
orientation tomorrow unless the Court tells her otherwise, which has not
 happened,' Steve Honig, Lohan's spokesperson told Radar.

Clean-up duty: Lohan has been ordered to complete 16 hours at the morgue before her next court hearing on November 2

Lohan will face the wrath of Judge Sautner on her next court appearance on November 2.

The actress was ordered to undertake 16 hours of morgue duty on Wednesday before her November court hearing.

So long as she manages to complete these hours in the next two weeks she is not in violation of her probation.

However, the Coroner's Office will 
notify the Probation's Volunteer Center - which monitors Lindsay's 
probation - of Thursday's drama before the judge is formally told.

Long arm of the law: Lindsay seen here arriving for her court hearing on Wednesday

Finding her feet: Lindsay tweet from yesterday apologising for the confusion at the morgue and suggesting she had got lost

Lohan is already skating on thin ice 
with Sautner, who on Wednesday blasted the Mean Girls star for not making 
an effort to complete her probation.

The judge is incensed the actress has
 barely scratched the surface of the 480 hours of community service she 
was ordered to complete as part of her sentence for the theft of a gold 
necklace earlier this year.

Lohan only did around a 
day-and-a-half at the Downtown Women's Centre in LA - and failed to show
 up nine times, resulting in her being rejected from the programme.

This week she did some volunteer work
 for the Red Cross - but Sautner ruled it as void because it was not 
part of the sentence she had specifically stipulated at an earlier 
hearing.

Sautner said only time completed at the women's centre and the morgue counted.

In a further development, LA County 
Sheriff Lee Baca has told Fox 11's Good Day LA that the overcrowding 
issue will not keep Lohan out of jail.

He told the show that if Lindsay is 
sentenced to jail time he will make sure he finds room for her, adding 
she needs at least 60 days inside to be rehabilitated.

What a twit: She also tweeted that she was pleased to be going to therapy after a stressful day yesterday and in court on Wednesday

Rejected: Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter tells reporters Lohan arrived late for her court-ordered community service and was sent away

The news comes after Lohan's father Michael spoke out, alleging his daughter was back on drugs and needs help.

He said the recent photos of her 
discoloured and apparently rotting teeth was down to her smoking 
methamphetamine or crack cocaine. 

Lohan posted $100,000 bail on Wednesday following her court hearing.

Meanwhile, the beleaguered star's mother is set to blow the lid on her daughter's alleged drug and alcohol use in a memoir she's currently shopping around Hollywood.

Website TMZ has obtained the draft of a prologue for Dina Lohan's memoir, which Dina's spokesperson is pitching to the literary world. 

An excerpt from the prologue allegedly written by Dina says: 'I blamed her friends, her career and her handlers for an (sic) newfound lifestyle of partying excessively. 

'Drinking, drugging and behaving irresponsibly became Lindsay's way of daily living--and it tore me up inside.'
