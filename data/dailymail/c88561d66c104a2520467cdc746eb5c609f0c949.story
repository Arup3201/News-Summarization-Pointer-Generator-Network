A Lotus Formula One car raced by British driver Graham Hill is set to fetch up to £1million at auction.

The Lotus 49B Grand Prix car was also raced by fellow world champions Jim Clark, Jochen Rindt and Emerson Fittipaldi.

Designed by Lotus legend Colin Chapman and built in 1968, the iconic car is one of only a handful of 49s still in existence.

Classics: The car is expected to fetch as much as £1million at auction

Restored: The car was badly damaged in the 1970s, but was restored by previous owner John Dawson-Damer

Champion: The car was raced by Formula One legend Graham Hill

It is the last Lotus to be sold from the collection of late British racer John Dawson-Damer.

Dawson-Damer tragically died when he crashed his 1969 Lotus 63 at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in 2000.

The car is expected to draw interest from collectors at the Bonhams’ sale at the same Goodwood festival in June.

James Knight, Bonhams group motoring director, said: 'By every standard, Colin Chapman’s Lotus 49 concept is an absolute landmark in Formula One design.

'It simply raised the bar for every rival manufacturer and its Cosworth-Ford V8 engine went on to win a record 155 world championship Grands Prix.

Champions: The classic car, seen driven by Hill, back, has also had champions Jim Clark, Jochen Rindt and Emerson Fittipaldi in the driver's seat

'This car was Graham Hill’s but it was also raced by that wonderful driver Richard Attwood to set the fastest lap at Monaco in 1969.

'And private owner Dave Charlton drove it to become South African national champion.

'Add the excellent provenance of it being offered direct from the famous Dawson-Damer collection and plainly it is an iconic car.'

The Lotus 49 was a new high for Formula One performance, winning its debut race at the 1967 Dutch Grand Prix with Jim Clark at the wheel.

Hill won his second Formula One world championship title in 1968 for Gold Leaf Team Lotus in the improved 49B type.

After ending its racing days in South Africa in 1972, the car was badly damaged by the time it was bought by Dawson-Damer. He painstakingly restored it to race-worthy condition.

Dawson-Damer’s six other Lotus Formula One cars sold in a Sydney auction for a total of £1.2million in 2008.

His 1963 Lotus-Climax 25 driven by Clark went to an Australian collector for a then world record £590,000.

And his 1978-79 Lotus-Ford 79 driven by American Formula One world champion Mario Andretti went to a Japanese Lotus enthusiast for £220,000.

The auction in Chichester, West Sussex takes place on June 27.
