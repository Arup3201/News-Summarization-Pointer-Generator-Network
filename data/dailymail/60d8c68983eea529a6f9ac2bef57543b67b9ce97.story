They were the sort of holiday postcards that cried out: ‘Wish you were here!’ to the folks back home.

Children playing in the sun with their buckets and spades and charabancs disgorging their hordes of happy passengers at resorts as far afield as Ramsgate and Mevagissey.

Hole in one: Players in floral skirts and bright jackets make a breezy day at Gyllyngvase beach and crazy golf course in Falmouth look better than any exotic holiday

Picture perfect: No one has sand in their sandwiches in this wholesome image of the sunny seaside at Gorran Haven harbour, near Mevagissey in Cornwall

Roll up, roll up: From a helter skelter to a carousel, visitors are guaranteed to have a good time at Battersea Park fun fair in London. Lines of bunting and colourful rides create a sense of nostalgia

Inspiring: This tranquil river scene, where swans bob on the glassy water and willows hang overhead in  Stratford-upon-Avon, could feature in a Shakespeare sonnet

Sign of the times: The distinctive architecture of the Sixties comes to the fore in this image of the Oasis Tower in Great Yarmouth

Anyone for a spot of fishing? The tall masts of fishing boats at Ramsgate harbour complete the perfect snap of a seaside promenade

These are the iconic, idyllic summertime scenes from the Sixties created by Somerset-born photographer John Hinde, whose encapsulation of happy holidays are currently featured in Postcards, an exhibition at London’s Photographers’ Gallery.

It is no coincidence that each one appears to have come straight from a glossy brochure, because Hinde, who used the ground floor of his house as studio and production department, was meticulous in making sure every scene looked just right — even down to removing or covering up eyesores.

‘We were given instructions to get the best shot possible, no matter how long it might take’ said Edmund Nagele, one of the small team of photographers recruited to Hinde’s burgeoning business.

Splash of colour: A swathe of identical beach huts in pastel colours, painted two-by-two at Bude in Cornwall look artificial against the backdrop of craggy cliffs and waves

Not-so-natural: The artificial-looking grass in the foreground of this photograph gives Plymouth's Tamar Bridge an otherworldly feel

Taking the plunge: The azure blue of Ramsgate's popular outdoor bathing pool draws the eye in contrast to the muted colour of the sea behind

Revving up: A crowd gather to watch motor racing at St Quen's Bay. The scene, bursting with detail and energy, shows the style of the era off, both in fashion and motors

‘And it often took several weeks to capture a single postcard snap.’

Hinde also wanted people in his 
postcards — ‘they gave the picture life, a point of interest and more 
importantly a blob of colour’ — and was not averse to getting his 
Italian editors to remove unsightly telegraph poles or make dull colours
 more vibrant.

Born in Street, Somerset, Hinde was the great-grandson of James Clark, founder of the town’s Clark’s Shoes.

He
 worked as a war photographer capturing scenes of the Blitz, then in 
1949 he briefly put down his camera to work as a PR manager for 
Chipperfield and Bertram Mills circuses where he met his wife, Jutta, a 
trapeze artist.

On the river: The historic Bodinnick to Fowey ferry in Cornwall takes off with just four cars on board. Two boys watch on in amazement as the ferry sets off on its journey

The perfect way to spend a day: The photographs of outdoor activites and nature at its finest would encourage the laziest of viewer to get out of the house and embrace the great outdoors

Psychedelic: A rare nighttime photograph highlights the neon colours of a the funfair in great Yarmouth, giving the photograph a dynamic feel

But he went back to photography and founded John Hinde Ltd in Dublin.

Over the next decade he produced 
idealistic and nostalgic images of Ireland for postcards which still 
sell in their millions today.

He was also responsible for a series of photographs of Butlins holiday 
camps which made him proprietor of one of the biggest postcard companies
 in the world.

In 1972 he sold the company to pursue a love of painting which took his family to France, where he died aged 81 in 1997.

Postcards,
 an exhibition from John Hinde Limited is on show at  The Photographers’
 Gallery, 16 to 18 Ramillies St, London W1F 7LW until October 6.

Plain sailing: The sere-looking boating lake in Cromer, Norfolk is a haven for young rowers, who can paddle around safely as their parents watch on

Paddling perfection: Happy children at play in a lido St Nicholas¿s Park, Warwick. The pastoral background of a church spire, chimney tops and lush trees adds a tranquil element to the dynamic image

Sea view: Caravans form a regular pattern as they are parked side-by-side in neat rows at Pentewan Sands, Cornwall. Their owners couldn't get much closer to their sea view- they're almost on the sand

Full of life: From the shoppers storlling along the pavement to the queue outside the ice cream van, the promenade at Havre des Pas, Jersey is bursting with action

Ship ahoy! Two boys approach an anchored ship in St Ives. From the fluffy clouds to perfect blue sky and lighthouse, it's a perfect Summer's day

Do you dare? The winding roller coasters at the famous pleasure beach in Blackpool may not look up to today's health and safety standards, but they look like a lot of fun
