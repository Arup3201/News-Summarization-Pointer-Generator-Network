City of Sydney council admits it did not follow up a complaint about a property being used illegally to house backpackers, after a fire unearthed the makeshift slum.

Backpackers who were living in shipping containers and caravans on the industrial complex in Alexandria that was destroyed by the fire were paying as little as $80-a-week for their accommodation.

On Thursday the City revealed after an 'extensive review' of its phone records, it found one complaint.

'Unfortunately, contrary to city procedures, the complaint was not logged in the internal records system and was therefore not found or investigated,' the council said in statement.

The fire broke out at a bus parking facility at about 1.40am on Wednesday and was fast-moving and intense

While the complaint did not include an address, the council determined that it referred to the property involved in the blaze, and as a result of this discovery, the council has started an immediate review of all relevant procedures.

It is also preparing to serve a Local Government Act Order to the owner of the property, which will block access to the site.

However on Tuesday, the City of Sydney told the Daily Mail Australia it had received no complaints of people living unauthorised in the business park.

'The City has received no previous reports or complaints of this kind about the premises. We investigate all reports of unauthorised use of premises for accommodation to prevent dangerous events like this from occurring.'

The council said today such complaints were not uncommon - it had investigated more than 1000 reports of unauthorised property use and overcrowding in the past year.

'Overcrowding and the use of premises as unauthorised short-term accommodation is an ongoing issue for many local councils,' a council spokeswoman said.

City of Sydney used the Alexandria squalor to call for greater powers to tackle the illegal accommodation problem.

The fire and the property owner, Masaaki Imaeda, are under investigation by council and police

The property was authorised as a business park, meaning it was illegal to use it for residential purposes. The maximum penalty for a breach of the act is $1.1 million.

One of the 18 tourists who had been staying in the accommodation told The Daily Telegraph that he had been living there for four months and that 15 people shared one toilet.

The fire was brought under control by firefighters in a few hours, the reason for the blaze is not yet known

Eigi Tamada, from Japan said the people sleeping in the shipping containers were 'very scared' when the fire broke out.

'Suddenly there was a big bang, then there was smoke, we ran out,' he told The Daily Telegraph.

A woman who operated a catering business from the site in Alexandria told the Sydney Morning Herald that her landlord, Masaaki Imaeda, had started renting out an old bus with no wheels and two caravans to foreign nationals two months ago to 'make a quick buck'.

She set Imaeda had set up washing machines and other appliances around the complex and put a portaloo in a car wash area.

'It's obscene, now I've lost my business because of his greed. That's it, I'm done,' she told the Sydney Morning Herald.

About 70 firefighters were called to the blaze in Alexandria, Sydney, which broke out around 1.40am on Wednesday.

The fire started in a building near the squatters' camp but investigators don't think the group, aged in their late teens and early 20s, had anything to do with it starting.

Crews were stunned to find 18 people, thought to be from Japan and South Korea, squatting in the containers at the site on Burrows Road.

Firefighters thought they had been called to a run-of-the-mill industrial fire but it quickly became a rescue operation when people began running out from the back of the bus parking businesss.

The squatters were living in shocking conditions on mattresses in a shipping container, an old mini-bus and a caravan.

Four people were rescued and 14 evacuated by firefighters from the fire, which firefighters described as a 'severe threat to life'

NSW Fire & Rescue Commissioner Greg Mullins said four people had to be rescued as they were too frightened to move.

'There were 20-metre flames,' he told reporters on Wednesday.

'Had the firefighters not realised they were there, they well could have lost their lives.'

'I'm outraged that there would be something like this in the heart of Sydney,' he said.

'It looks like someone has been taking advantage of these people, maybe they were squatters we don't know yet.'

The tourists have since been taken to alternative accommodation, a hotel in the CBD.

The owner of the property, who claimed to live on site, spent the morning exploring the smouldering damage alongside detectives, and it's understood he knew the backpackers were lodging in his building, as he confirmed the headcount of people for the firefighters.

He refused to answer any questions from media about the unusual living arrangements as he got into a car with detectives on Wednesday morning.

A man who kept his bus parked on the property said he had no idea backpackers were living on site.'It's a bit of a shock,' said the man, who called himself Sam.

Inspector Ron James said the fire was extremely intense and fast-moving and posed a serious risk to life.

'The fire was that intense that the firies had to put their bodies between the fire and the people they were rescuing to get them out,' Insp James said.

'It was very intense. It was that intense vehicles were melting on the other side of the car park.'

The blaze started at a neighbouring bus depot and quickly spread next door to a NSW Public Works building. It took about two hours for crews to get the fire under control.

No one was injured and firefighters spent the morning putting out spot fires hours. It's not yet known what caused the fire.

The Department of Immigration is currently investigating whether the people who were living at the depot have valid visas to be in the country.

One of the buildings the fire spread to was the 'Stoneyard', a New South Wales Public Works site used for conducting stonemasonry related to the restoration of heritage stone buildings.

Firefighters said the blaze was so intense that it melted cars on the other side of the car park

Police remained on the scene throughout the morning putting out spot fires and monitoring the situation
