A high school teacher from Portland says he was fired because of his religious beliefs and pro-life views.

Math teacher Bill Diss had been out of the classroom since March after he was put on paid administrative leave after a teaching career spanning 11 years.

He has now been formally fired by Portland Public Schools but believes his termination was a long time coming after making his anti-abortionist views known.

Fired: High school teacher Bill Diss claims he was fired because of his stance against abortion. Troubles began in 2007 when he publicly protested against a new Planned Parenthood building

On the day he was told to leave the school in March of this year, Mr Diss was apparently given just a few minutes to collect his things and was escorted from school premises by police,

He described himself as a teacher with great reviews before 2007, but he told KATU things took a dramatic shift after the Planned Parenthood protest.

Mr Diss publicly opposed the construction of a new Planned Parenthood headquarters building in the northeast of the city.

'The review I got in 2010, in every single area, were very negative comments,' says Mr Diss. 'I was marked down in a whole bunch of areas. I was even marked down for how my classroom looked.'

He doesn't believe he was doing his job poorly but that school leaders deliberately took issue with how he did things because they disagreed with his pro-life stance.

The Portland School Board approved his firing by a 6-1 vote. Mr Diss says he is now considering taking legal action against the school.

Although the School District wouldn't comment on why Mr Diss was ultimately fired, they = did release a statement:

'Mr. Diss has said his termination was based on his religious beliefs and his right to free speech. That is not the case.

The school district takes discipline of all employees seriously.  Mr. Diss’s conduct and performance led to his removal from the classroom and termination.

State law protects an employee’s privacy and does not allow the school district to discuss personnel matters in detail.'

Former students told KGW-TV Diss is known for sharing his anti-abortion views at school.

'He doesn’t do it a lot, but students do make fun of him for being against it and everything,' junior Ty’sha Harrell said. When he does talk about it, he does have really good views and everything, sometimes he goes too deep into it. He brings religion into it.'

Benson High School: Mr Diss was put on administrative leave in March and was formally fired by Portland Public Schools at a board hearing earlier this week. He  doesn't believe he was doing his job poorly

In one suspension letter provided to The Oregonian, school officials accused him of trying to block students from attending the Planned Parenthood program because of his religious beliefs and told them to 'shut (their) mouths.'

Mr Diss was reprimanded by the district in September 2012 after he refused to allow employees of teenage pregnancy prevention initiative to speak to students because the employees were from Planned Parenthood.

The teacher had been a longtime critic against the organization, and had often helped bring dozens of pro-life protestors to school board meetings.

At the November hearing, multiple administrators testified that Mr Diss was often rude to students and had a pattern of behavior that was damaging to his relationships with students and co-workers.

It was revealed Mr Diss had intimidated and harassed students along with other staff, although he denies the claims that he ever disrespected students.

'I don't think so,' he says. 'I would certainly get after students. I mean, I'm their teacher. It's kind of interesting because administrators before 2007 wrote that I'm very respectful to students. All of a sudden, it just changed.'

Mr Diss says there are still ways to appeal his firing within the district. If those attempts fail, he may consider legal action.
