Bernie Ecclestone has issued an edict instructing the Formula One grid to observe ‘total silence’ for the playing of the Russian national anthem in front of President Putin on Sunday.

The unprecedented instruction was sent to the teams in an email on Saturday ahead of the Russian Grand Prix - a stricture that has never before been issued for the attendance of a president or head of state at a race.

‘We kindly request that during the national anthem there is to be total silence on the starting grid,’ said the email.

‘It has been alleged that F1 is one of the most ill-mannered sports in relation to the national anthem and complaints from fans, public and political institutions are now too heavy to ignore.’

Ecclestone’s friend, Putin will attend the race with high security amid controversy over Russia’s behaviour in the region.
