'Britain's vainest man' has applied for free Botox for life on the NHS - and also wants an operation to have his ears pinned back.

Sam Barton, 22, has told doctors that he needs the free cosmetic treatment to combat the anxiety over his appearance that his 'new-found fame' has provoked.

The wannabe celebrity from Four Oaks in Sutton Coldfield says his symptoms have got worse since he made national headlines earlier this year by revealing how he had received a free £5,000 nose job on the NHS in a bid for the perfect looks.

Free beauty treatments: Sam Barton, 22, wants botox on the NHS and would also like his ears pinned back

Now he wants Botox and the ear operation approved by the health service.

Sam said: 'I went to see my doctor on Monday to sow the seeds in his head, I now have an appointment in September to discuss having free Botox treatment.

'Since I was in the newspapers people recognise and stare at me more and it makes me sweat a lot through anxiety. 

'I have over 20,000 followers on Twitter and I do get trolled sometimes by some nasty individuals.

'I am very self-conscious about my appearance and I have told the doctors that I need to have regular Botox treatment to keep up my appearance and to make me feel more confident and less self-conscious.

Surgery: Sam was previously granted a free nose job on the NHS by pretending to be upset about his looks 

'After they have agree to fund my Botox treatment on the NHS I will then apply to have my ears pinned back, as one sticks out a lot.'

If Sam is given the go-ahead from the NHS, the Botox treatment will cost around £3,000 per year for six injections every two months.

He defended his NHS request and said: 'I don't smoke or take drugs or drink to excess so I am not a drain on the NHS like some people who come into hospital with alcohol or health problems due to smoking. 

'I think I am well within my rights to get what I can. If they say no to me I will simply book an appointment the next day to see another doctor. I will get what I can.'

Transformation: Sam has had almost £33,000 worth of cosmetic surgery in a bid to look more like Joey Essex

Big ambitions: Sam is hoping his newly transformed looks will give him a route to the fame he craves 

Sam is the grandson of Aston Villa's European Cup winning boss Tony Barton and is best friends with Benefits Street star White Dee.

Fame-hungry Sam previously revealed he had spent  £55,000 on reconstructive surgery and beauty treatments to turn himself into the 'perfect man.'

And he has amassed credit card debts of £25,000 in four years in search of the Joey Essex look that he hopes will make him a star.

He has spent £20,000 on treatment for his teeth, around £5,000 on Botox, £2,000 on waxing and £2,500 on tanning treatment. 

Two nose jobs have cost £10,400, although one was free on the NHS.

Sam is also planning to go to a cosmetic clinic in Belgium in December to receive vaser lipo surgery, so he can have a permanent six pack and will also get his jaw realigned while there but is funding that treatment himself.
