A mother left looking after her burglar brother's five children while he is in prison has moaned 'what about my human rights?'.

Wayne Bishop, 34, has finally been locked up after he was released from prison a year ago for after telling the appeal court that custody breached his 'right' to be with his family.

Now his jobless sister Sherrie McKinley, 36, has been left looking after Wayne's children - as well as her own six - in her cramped three-bedroom home.

Cramped home: Sherrie with her six children and Wayne Bishop's two boys and a girl she is looking after. They are (l to r) Charly, Jade, Chanie, Joe, Te-Jay, Mason who is being held by Sherrie. Then, to her right, are Wayne's children Taylor, Courteney, Kyle, Katie and Brandon

Sherrie, an unemployed divorcee who costs taxpayers £2,500 per month in benefits, branded her brother an 'idiot' after she was left looking after 11 in her tiny property, the People reported.

Bishop's children would likely have been put into care if she had not stepped in and taken them under her wing.

He was given eight months for carrying out a vicious assault - just three weeks after he was released from custody last year having deployed his human rights argument.

Jailed: Wayne Bishop, 34, was finally jailed last week for eight months at Nottingham Crown Court after dodging jail last year 'because prison would breach his human rights'

Sherrie told the People: 'He complains about his human rights but what about my own and my kids' human rights? We're all having to make sacrifices because of his stupid mistakes.'

Bishop, jailed at Nottingham Crown Court, is likely to be out of prison in just four months. Last year he was behind bars for burglary and dangerous driving - but was released after he appealed.

As he was jailed this week, Judge Michael Stokes condemned the 
34-year-old’s cynical exploitation of the European human rights 
legislation to try to avoid punishment.

Sherrie said that the father-of-five believed the court were going to let him off again so he could look after three girls and two boys. But when he was sent to prison, she had no option but to move them into his property.

The small end-of-terrace property they share has two large bedrooms and a third small one - and a single bathroom for all 12 of them.

But despite the cramped conditions, they have managed to find room for four televisions - including a monster 50inch set in the lounge.

With space at such a premium, the living room is also being used as a bedroom.

Sherrie has got herself a king-sized bed which she shares with her son who is just a toddler while the other ten share two bedrooms.

The property costs £550 per month to 
rent - and the taxpayer contributes £500 towards the bill. In addition 
Sherrie, a former hairdresser, claims £2,000 in handouts.

Her two eldest daughters, Jade, 18, and Chanie, 17, have moaned that Wayne's children are 'grubby and rude'.

Her other children are Charly, 11, Te-Jay, eight, Mason, two, and her nephew Joesph, 15.

Bishop's young brood who have moved into Sherrie's home in Clifton, Nottingham, are Courteney, 14, Katie, 12, Taylor, ten,
Brandon, eight, and Kyle, seven.

Once the children are settled into her house Sherrie said she might look into seeing whether she can get any further benefits.

She added: 'I'm doing it for his five kids, who are my flesh and blood, and face not having a roof over their heads because their stupid dad keeps getting into trouble and letting them down.

'They're devastated that their dad who promised to behave for their sakes has been locked up.'

After Wayne was sent to jail, Sherrie blamed her jailbird father Phillip Wheelhouse for her brother’s life of crime.

Support: Wayne Bishop's nieces said in a statement outside court that people don't know the full situation about their relative (right)

In a statement, read outside court by her daughter Jade, she said: 
‘Perhaps, if as children, we had had the right upbringing and guidance, 
instead of our father being in and out of jail all of our childhood 
life, Wayne would have been able to think before his actions.

‘Instead he follows our father’s footsteps.’

Mr Wheelhouse, 60, had insisted in an interview last month that his son 
had been ‘brought up proper’ – but deserved to go to jail.

Sherrie has already spent £90 of her savings buying pyjamas for all of Wayne's children - and three sets of school uniform.

The children's real mother is alleged to have alcohol problems - and apparently gave up all right to see them six years ago.

Her parents - and the children's grandparents - are estranged.

As Wayne was jailed for eight months, the judge told him: ‘I am afraid, Mr Bishop, you have to learn that other people 
have rights apart from you.

‘We all have the right not to have 
our homes and premises burgled. We all have the right to walk the 
streets without fear of being attacked.

‘The rights that are set out by the 
European Convention on Human Rights are not to be produced like the ace 
of trumps to avoid a prison sentence.’
