Bolton Wanderers chairman Phil Gartside and former manager Sammy Lee have appeared in court to face allegations of perjury in relation to the £1million transfer of Gavin McCann.

They were among nine defendants – including Bolton secretary Simon Marland, agent Jerome Anderson and former Bolton director of football Frank McParland (now at Brentford) - who appeared at Newcastle Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday morning.

The private prosecution has been brought by agent Tony McGill, who claims Bolton and Sports Entertainment Media (SEM) cut him out of the deal which saw McCann move to Bolton from Aston Villa in 2007.

McCann – who is now retired - did not attend but will appear next week on four counts of perjury and one of fraud by false representation.

Former England international Lee – now on the coaching staff at Southampton – was in charge of Bolton at the time.

No pleas were entered and the case has been sent to Newcastle Crown Court where it will be heard on March 11.

Mr McGill lost his original case last September when he tried to sue Bolton and SEM for £300,000. However, the judge at Manchester civil justice centre described him as ‘credible’ and the outcome of his legal battle as ‘unfortunate’.

That gave him the determination to fund the private prosecution himself, which Sportsmail understands already totals more than £500,000.

Lisa Judge, representing the defendants from Bolton Wanderers, said: ‘There will be an application to dismiss forthwith.’ Each of the defendants stood up and gave their name, date of birth and address at the beginning of the hearing.
