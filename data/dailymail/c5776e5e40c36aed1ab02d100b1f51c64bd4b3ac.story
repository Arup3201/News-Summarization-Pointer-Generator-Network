They might not have had Botox or Photoshop at their disposal, but the Hollywood icons of yesteryear still reign supreme in the beauty stakes.

That's according to a new survey, which named Hollywood star Audrey Hepburn as the ultimate beauty icon of all time.

The screen legend – best known for her role in Breakfast at Tiffany’s – fought off tough competition from Beyoncé, who despite being the most googled female of 2014, came fifth.

Sitting in second place is Marilyn Monroe, while fellow Hollywood star Grace Kelly came third in the survey which quizzed over 2,000 Brits.

Even Scarlett Johansson couldn’t compete with the big beauty hitters from Hollywood’s golden age to make the top five.

Kate Moss only scooped two per cent of the votes, which placed her in eighth position on the list.

The survey carried out by leading cosmetics and skincare brand Artistry by Amway also asked 2,000 women across the UK to reveal their views about beauty and their beauty regime.

American actress and sultry stunner Ava Gardner (1922-1990) was voted ninth top beauty icon of all time

Asked what is it that makes women feel more beautiful more than two thirds (68 per cent) said confidence is the holy grail of beauty.

Over half (57 per cent) claimed being in love makes woman more attractive and 38 per cent said they felt better about themselves when they have their make-up on.

Rather than being negative about the impact of ageing, women aged 55 and over are more content with their own beauty (26 per cent) versus younger women aged 18 to 24 (22 per cent).

Also, younger ladies aged 18 to 24 admit to wearing a lot of make-up to help them feel more beautiful (20 per cent) while the more mature lady is less inclined to rely heavily on cosmetics (4 per cent).

And as the old adage goes, wisdom comes with age.

Women aged 55 and over understand that a healthy diet and exercise regime contributes to one’s own beauty (62 per cent) compared to women aged 35 to 44 (55 per cent). 

On the spending front, Brits still remain pretty thrifty when forking out on beauty products. 

Almost half said they spend less than £10 a month on beautifying themselves.

Demonstrating some national confidence, the survey also found Brits ranked themselves first for being the most beautiful, whilst placing the French  in fifth place. 

Swedes, Brazilians and Spanish came in third, fourth and fifth place.

A spokesperson at Amway UK said: ‘The study reveals some great insights into what defines beauty and what makes a women feel beautiful.'
