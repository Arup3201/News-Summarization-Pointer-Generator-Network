Former newspaper tycoon Eddy Shah (pictured with his wife Jennifer outside court yesterday) has been cleared at the Old Bailey of raping a schoolgirl during the early 1990s

Eddy Shah was cleared yesterday of six rapes against an underage girl at top London hotels.

The former newspaper tycoon appeared close to tears and thanked the jury as the verdict was read at the Old Bailey.

His wife Jennifer was also in tears as he was found not guilty of six counts of raping the girl during the early 1990s when she was aged between 12 and 15.

After 17 hours and 46 minutes of deliberations, a jury at the Old Bailey cleared him of six counts of raping a girl under 16.

After the hearing he called for a review of how rape cases are dealt with by police as he said: 'Anybody walking down the street can point at a celebrity and say, "he raped me".'

Former escort Susan Davies, 53, of Swanley, Kent, was cleared of forcing the complainant, now in her early 30s, to have threesomes with her and Shah.

Mr Shah maintained that he met the girl twice in hotels while she was accompanied by Davies but never had sex with her.

Davies was found not guilty of aiding and abetting rape, indecent assault and cruelty to a person under 16.

A
 third defendant, businessman Anthony Pallant, 53, of West Malling, 
Kent, was also cleared of raping the girl during the same period with 
the assistance of Davies. He was found not guilty of rape and indecent 
assault.

During the trial, Ms Davies described 
how she had a relationship with Mr Shah for several years, but claimed 
that it never felt like she was working as a prostitute.

The court heard that Mr Shah would pay her around £100 to £200 for sex and brought her gifts such as a Pierre Cardin watch.

Ms Davies referred to him as a 'gentleman' and said that she had taken the girl twice to meet him because she thought he could have a positive influence on her life by talking to her. '

With hindsight it was a stupid decision,' she told the court.

Ms Davies also had a relationship with Mr Pallant, a three-times married medical equipment entrepreneur with whom she had a son.

Mr Shah, whose birth name is Selim Shah, founded the now-defunct Today newspaper in 1986.

After
 clashes with unions he was the first person to invoke Margaret 
Thatcher's anti-union laws. He went on to write several novels.

After the hearing Mr Shah called for a review of how rape cases are dealt with by police

Speaking outside court Mr Shah said the case had been brought because of 'cheap policing and cheap prosecution'.

He
 said: 'I was brought to trial with no real evidence at all - all they 
had was the word of a girl and nothing was actually backed up.

'Having been through what I have just been through, I think they should look at what happens.

'They
 look at it subjectively, not objectively - they just take it to trial 
and I think that is very wrong, there should be some evidence.'

Referring
 to his relationship with an escort, which he admitted in court, he 
said: 'Hundreds of thousands of men do that and that was 20 years ago.

'I
 have tried to make it up to my wife and children but it has caused some
 problems - two of my children have forgiven me but I know they will 
still hold it against me for a long while.'

Shah said his experience had been a 'nightmare' for his family and brought him to the brink of bankruptcy.

He said: 'I felt embarrassed going out where I live, to the supermarket and chemist. I really do feel everybody looking at you.

'I have locked myself away for 22 
months now. My business has suffered, it is almost bankrupted us.

'We 
have had to sell our golf club, people were not coming to the business.

'It
 is really a situation where you have got to try and pick yourself up 
over something that had absolutely no evidence at all, it was a 
fantasy.'

'I was brought to trial with no real evidence at all - all they had was the word of a girl and nothing was actually backed up'

He said he planned to 'take a break' before writing about the 22 months since he was first accused of the sex assaults.

His former model and actress wife said that when her husband was arrested she initially thought it was a joke by their policeman son.

She said of the verdict: 'I'm so pleased because it is a case that shouldn't have been brought in the first instance.

'It has been 11 weeks and a half long and this sort of thing destroys families, people and children - not just us but the other defendants as well. So what a great verdict and what a good verdict.'
