George North goes into the most important club game of his career this afternoon hoping that he can find his cape and be ready to fly on another grand occasion.

The Wales wing arrived at  Northampton last summer with a reluctant superhero’s aura, acquired on the strength of his stirring deeds for the Lions in Australia.

In his first season for the Saints, the 22-year-old has moved heaven and earth to live up to his reputation and while his club are delighted with his endeavours, he has found it hard to fulfil his billing on a weekly basis.

Great expectations: George North earned his reputation for his heroics on Lions tour of South Africa

‘Coming here, it’s like Superman — my Kryptonite is the fact that I can’t get myself going every time,’ he said ahead of Saturday’s Aviva  Premiership final against Saracens at Twickenham. ‘The season is so long and it’s been tough just trying to stay in one piece.

‘Off the back of the Lions, I have come with a bit of expectation on my head. I sometimes feel like I haven’t done as much as I was  hoping and I’ve been marked out of some games.

‘I’m my own worst critic but at the same time it’s not been too bad considering it’s been after a Lions tour, it’s such a long season and I’ve moved to a new place. I’ve got to give myself a bit of leeway.’

North may self-analyse with a harsh eye but he is a fundamentally positive character so critical reflection soon gives way to satisfaction about his move from Llanelli to the East Midlands. Last week, Northampton won the Amlin Challenge Cup and now they are one win away from the league title, so their high-profile signing has enjoyed being part of a team success even sooner than he had dared to imagine.

The environment he has found himself in is similar to the one he left behind in Wales. ‘Rugby is king here,’ he said. ‘Rugby is god. It’s quite like Wales because everyone gets involved but it’s a bigger  goldfish bowl. It’s more of a pond! Everyone has been super-kind. Walking round the supermarket, I’ll be choosing my bananas and  people will come up and say “Good luck on Saturday, we’ll be there”.’

Food and drink references occur frequently as North considers his existence in English rugby. Asked if he has now come to terms with public attention at such a young age, he added: ‘It’s chips and rice — half and half. I’m more aware of it now since coming back from the Lions tour.

‘It’s part of the job but I sometimes find it difficult dealing with that — the other half of rugby. I still find it strange when people want to hear my opinion because I just think I talk rubbish most of the time — I haven’t got too much wisdom!’

He came into the Premiership with a notion of what the game would be like. As a Welshman with an outsider’s perspective of English rugby, North expected an endless routine of arm-wrestle contests and limited openings out wide. Since then he has changed his mind — to an extent.

‘I would say it is 75 per cent the same as I thought it would be,’ he said. ‘It is very physical. They love to maul it. They love a forwards game. But I’m quite lucky that at Northampton we do play quite an open game. That helps me. Other clubs like Bath, Sarries, Quins also play some beautiful rugby.

‘It is not just stick-it-up-the-jumper rugby all the time so my perception was wrong in a way. You’ve got what I call the boring bits — scrums, lineouts and mauling. You need that sometimes, especially if you have a dominant pack. But you also need the va-va-voom!’

That’s where North comes in. He has provided vivid flashes of that game-breaking quality, such as when he carved Gloucester open at Kingsholm early in the campaign, to set up the try of the season for Jamie Elliott. He has savoured a handful of games when he has gone through his full repertoire but also the major team landmarks such as beating Leicester in the semi-final at a fervent Franklin’s Gardens. ‘That whole experience will stay with me forever,’ he said. ‘It was awesome. It was epic.’

Along the way, there have been times when the cape has slipped off his weary shoulders — when the Kryptonite of weekly demand has dragged him down. ‘Now and again I’ve thought, “I could do with a week off”,’ he said. ‘This season has been really hard but I’ve really enjoyed it, too.

‘I am looking forward to some time off. I love my job but it is good to get away from it occasionally. I worked out the other day that by the time this season is over I’ll have been going for two years and a  couple of months without a  substantial break, so this summer will be great.

‘People keep asking me if I’m going away but I’m not. The only thing I’ve booked is to go to  Glasgow to see Becky (girlfriend cyclist Becky James) racing in the  Commonwealth Games. Apart from that it will just be nice to go home, sit down and have a cup of tea with my mum, go for a ride on my bike and play a bit of golf. I need the break, mentally more than anything.’

Long season: George North admits there are times when he has wanted to take a week off

Before that welcome respite North has three more monumental occasions ahead of him.

He expects a titanic tussle with Saracens and doesn’t dare hope that their Heineken Cup final defeat against Toulon last week will have broken their spirit. ‘Saracens will be wounded but they will dust themselves off and go again,’ he said. ‘They have been the dominant team in the Premiership this  season and they’ve got a great chance to win silverware this  weekend, but so do we.’

When the domestic duties are over he will join Wales for two Tests in South Africa. It looms as a  gruelling assignment for a side missing the likes of captain Sam Warburton and Leigh Halfpenny, but North believes the tourists have enough quality in their ranks to mount a compelling challenge.

‘There was talk they were going to rest some boys but you can’t go to South Africa with semi-skimmed milk,’ he said, in metaphor mode again. ‘We have to throw everything at them. People won’t expect much of us but no-one expected much of us going to the last World Cup and we came out strong. We’ve still got a hell of a squad. We’re taking as much firepower as possible.’
