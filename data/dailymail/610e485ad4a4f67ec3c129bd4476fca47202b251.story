A federal politician has come under fire for uploading a Miley Cyrus inspired cartoon on social media of Queensland Labor leader Annastacia Palaszczuk swinging nude on a wrecking ball.

Dawson coalition MP George Christensen, who isn't a stranger to creating outrage on social media, posted the cartoon on his Facebook page showing the Queensland opposition leader crashing into a wall representing jobs at the controversial Abbot Point Coal Terminal.

The words 'with apologies to Miley Cyrus' appeared in the top corner of the cartoon in reference to the pop star's film clip for Wrecking Ball.

The cartoon, which directed people to Mr Christensen's website, has since been removed. 

He wrote on his Facebook page on Wednesday: 'It's pretty pathetic to fake outrage at a joke just to score political points.'

'It's also unAustralian given taking the Mickey (especially out of politicians) has always been a strong part of our national culture. 

'I just wish we would lighten and have a laugh sometimes. I fear as a nation we are losing our sense of humour to political correctness.'

Premier Campbell Newman has since distanced himself from the post, urging political parties to focus on issues and not personal attacks. 

He told the Brisbane Times he had nothing to do with Mr Christensen's post and asked the remaining few days of the campaign remain free of personal smears.

'He must answer to his team,' Mr Newman said of Mr Christensen.

'I think when people get into personal stuff its always disappointing but again the point we're making in this campaign is let's just get away from personalities and attacks on individuals.'

A spokesman for Ms Palaszczuk told the online news site that the cartoon 'reflects the low standards Mr Christensen's state colleagues have displayed in this campaign'.

Ms Palaszczuk arrived in Mackay on Tuesday night where she will spend time campaigning.

Labor is still yet to release its costings, with just three days until the January 31 election.
