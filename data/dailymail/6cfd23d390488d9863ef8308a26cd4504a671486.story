Britons are being told by the health watchdog not to offer sweet treats to friends and family who are trying to lose weight.

They are also being instructed not to invite colleagues who are attempting to cut back on alcohol to go the pub after work.

The watchdog, NICE, says it is neither ‘helpful’ nor ‘a joke’ to deliberately try to tempt those who are desperately trying to stick to resolutions to become healthier.

Guidelines issued by the organisation today also urge doctors, nurses and midwives to question patients about their lifestyles when they arrive in A&E, have a routine appointment or scan, or come in to pick up a prescription.

Staff should use ‘every opportunity’ to help patients change unhealthy habits.

They are told not to be too ‘embarrassed’ to ask overweight patients sensitively whether they have thought about going on a diet, or would consider doing do so.

And if they suspect someone has a drink problem, they are encouraged to ask them questions designed to assess their alcohol intake.

The guidelines – published when millions have made New Year’s resolutions to tackle their weight or drinking – are intended to help health staff and the general public tackle the rising problem of obesity and excessive drinking.

Employers are told to consider banning staff from smoking throughout the working day and to ensure they motivate staff who are trying to lead healthier lives.

The advice also reminds local councils they have the power to ban pubs from opening in areas where there are already a high number of licensed premises.

But critics have accused NICE of ‘nannying’ and say the last thing adults need is to be ‘lectured’ on healthy living by their own friends and family.

Robert Oxley, of the Taxpayers’ Alliance campaign group, said: ‘This is subversive nannying from a health quango that puts out this kind of drivel in a desperate attempt to justify its continued and costly existence.

‘Many of us will be trying to shed a few extra pounds or cut back on the booze over the new year, but we don’t need quangocrats lecturing our friends and colleagues while we do so. This is further evidence that NICE is both a waste of everybody’s time and taxpayers’ money.’

With more than a quarter of Britons now obese, the guidelines urge medics not to be too ‘embarrassed’ to ask overweight patients sensitively whether they have thought about going on a diet, or would consider doing do so

But Professor Mike Kelly, director of the centre of public health at NICE, said: ‘The idea is quite simple. First of all you should share your goals with friends, family and work colleagues so they understand what you’re trying to do.

‘They also must understand it’s not helpful or a joke to tempt people deliberately. Some do – it’s a bit of fun. They go on a diet, and someone says, “Oh come on this cream cake won’t do any harm”.’

‘Say for example someone says, “I’m going to make a real effort to cut down on my drinking.” If the first thing that happens within the next five minutes is that a colleague says, “Come on, we’re all going down the pub after work”, that doesn’t help.

‘It’s asking people to be a bit more thoughtful, a bit more understanding of the difficulties. When people fall off their best intentions, they can’t keep on the diet, that’s where friends, family and so on can help.

‘It’s a bit of encouragement and it’s a way of sharing the task rather than people trying to do it on their own. It’s based on very sound psychological principles which acknowledge that our ambitions often outstrip our human capacity to do things.

‘It’s that nudge in the right direction that can keep people on track.’

Just over a quarter of adults in Britain are now obese while nearly half of men and a third of women drink too much alcohol.

NICE, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, says Britons have done very well in recent years to cut down on smoking, but obesity and excessive drinking remain huge public health concerns.

The watchdog is also in charge of deciding which new drugs should be available on the NHS and it has been criticised in the past for rejecting life-extending cancer drugs. Last year not one of the 11 new drugs made available was approved.

Some of its other health guidance has been deemed controversial. Last year it suggested councils should raise parking charges to encourage the public to walk.
