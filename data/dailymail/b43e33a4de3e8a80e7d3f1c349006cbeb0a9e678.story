Cleared: PC Mark Milton, who caused outrage by testing a patrol car at 159mph, was cleared of dangerous driving again after doing 108mph in a 40mph zone

A policeman who caused an outcry when he was cleared of dangerous driving after hitting speeds of 159mph was yesterday let off again for crashing his patrol car in a high-speed chase.

PC Mark Milton, 46, lost control of his BMW 5 Series while driving at a 'grossly excessive' 108mph in a 40mph zone.

He careered over a grass verge with such force that a front tyre shredded. But he walked free from court after claiming he was a 'very experienced' driver who had been 'dazzled by a light'.

The crash came after he made headlines in 2003 when he was cleared of dangerous driving after he was caught doing 159mph on a motorway.

Campaigners hit out at the time after a judge said Milton was the 'crème de la crème' of police drivers and he needed to speed to 'familiarise' himself with his new car.

Milton's latest court appearance was the result of a crash on October 26, 2011.

He told Worcester Crown Court he had been 'in a hurry' after leaving the Princess Royal Hospital in Telford, Shropshire, and was heading towards Whitchurch when he spotted a speeding Audi he suspected had been stolen.

Milton, who has worked for West Mercia Police for 21 years, sped along the A442 through the village of Cold Hatton before crashing.

His patrol car's black box recorded him reaching 108mph in a 40mph zone before he smashed into the central reservation at 92mph.

Milton told the court he mounted a verge because he was distracted by a dazzling light in the corner of his vision.

The policeman, who walked from the wreckage unharmed, and even managed to cycle home after his shift, was yesterday cleared of dangerous driving after telling the jury the crash was nothing to do with excessive speed.

The court heard he had been an advanced driver since 1995 and was 'very experienced' at handling fast cars.

The officer, who is also trained in 
the use of firearms, faced widespread condemnation after he was recorded
doing 159mph on the M54 in Shropshire in the early hours of December 5,
2003.

Safety campaigners were shocked when 
he was cleared of any wrongdoing, with district judge Bruce Morgan, at 
Ludlow magistrates' court, criticising the decision to prosecute. He 
said it was necessary for policemen such as Milton to practise their 
skills.

Anger: PC Mark Milton was driving a Vauxhall Vectra GSi 3.2 like this when he was caught doing 159pmh on the motorway a decade ago

He added that the expertise he showed behind the wheel was the driving equivalent of being a concert pianist.

After the case, the Royal Society for 
the Prevention of Accidents said travelling at such speeds could never 
be justified and called for stricter guidelines for police drivers.

The case returned to court after an 
appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions and Milton was convicted 
of the crime before he was again cleared in 2007 by the High Court, 
which ruled the decision to find him guilty was 'misdirected'.

It was considered a landmark case, resulting in courts having to take into account drivers' 'special skills' when prosecuting.

Milton, of Market Drayton, Shropshire, yesterday declined to comment outside court.
