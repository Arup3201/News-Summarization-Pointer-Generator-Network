Nature is believed to kill off around one in every ten million animals each year.

At this rate, for every 10,000 species of mammal on the planet, an entire species will have become extinct in the last millennium.

But now that humans are on the scene, species are dying off as much as 1,000 times faster than they did 60 million years ago, according to a new US study.

The study at Brown University analysed genetic variation in the family trees of a number of plant and animal species to look at how they spread over time. It also looked at fossil records.

Previous estimates looked only at fossils, which the authors said made previous estimates on extinction rates inaccurate as it didn't consider the exact species.

Scientists calculated a 'normal background rate' of extinction of 0.1 extinctions per million species per year.

Past estimates for the normal background rate was 10 yearly extinctions for 10 million species.

The new study found the pre-human extinction rate was 10 times lower than scientists had believed, which means that the current level is 10 times worse.

'This reinforces the urgency to conserve what is left and to try to reduce our impacts. It was very, very different before humans entered the scene,' said Jurriaan de Vos, a Brown University Phd researcher.

And they believe future extinction rates are likely to be 10,000 times higher than nature's rates of extinction.

'It's rather like your bank account on the day you get paid,' said Mr de Vos. 'It gets a burst of funds — akin to new species — that will quickly become extinct as you pay your bills.'

This paper follows a recent one in Science that tracks where species that are threatened or confined to small ranges around the world.

In most cases, the main cause of extinctions is human population growth, although the paper also says how humans have been able to promote conservation.

'We've known for 20 years that current rates of species extinctions are exceptionally high,' said Stuart Pimm, president of the conservation nonprofit organisation SavingSpecies.

'This new study comes up with a better estimate of the normal background rate — how fast species would go extinct were it not for human actions. 

'It's lower than we thought, meaning that the current extinction crisis is much worse by comparison.'

Five times, a vast majority of the world's life has been snuffed out in what have been called mass extinctions, often associated with giant meteor strikes.

End-Ordovician mass extinction

The first of the traditional big five extinction events, around 440 million years ago, was probably the second most severe. Virtually all life was in the sea at the time and around 85 per cent of these species vanished.

Late Devonian mass extinction

About 375-359 million years ago, major environmental changes caused a drawn-out extinction event that wiped out major fish groups and stopped new coral reefs forming for 100 million years.

End-Permian mass extinction (the Great Dying)

The largest extinction event and the one that affected the Earth’s ecology most profoundly took place 252 million years ago. As much as 97% of species that leave a fossil record disappeared forever.

End-Triassic mass extinction

Dinosaurs first appeared in the Early Triassic, but large amphibians and mammal-like reptiles were the dominant land animals. The rapid mass extinction that occurred 201 million years ago changed that.

End-Cretaceous mass extinction

An asteroid slammed down on Earth 66 million years ago, and is often blamed for ending the reign of the dinosaurs.
