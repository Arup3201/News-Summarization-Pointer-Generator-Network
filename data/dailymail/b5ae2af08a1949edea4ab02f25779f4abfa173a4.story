A university student was furious when she found her Facebook profile pictures had been stolen and used to advertise a 'no-strings attached' casual sex website.

Three pictures of Grace Marr, an English language student at Aston University, Birmingham, were used alongside a promotion offering 'hot horny singles in your local area'.

Embarrassingly, she only found out they were being used when she was contacted by a friend of her mother, who told her he had seen the advert while surfing the Internet last month.

Grace Marr was horrified to find that her Facebook profile pictures had been stolen and used to advertise an X-rated 'no-strings attached' casual sex website

Miss Marr, 20, said yesterday she was horrified to find her pictures had been ripped off, and she warned other young women to be wary of their Facebook privacy settings.

She said: 'It was after I had moved back to uni at the start of the new term.

'I got a phone call from my mum’s friend who works at a computer company, and he said he saw my Facebook photos on a weird sidebar advert.

'He said it was a pop-up and it said "do you know this girl" and there was a picture of me.

'He didn’t get the name of the site but described it as a website that you don’t really want to be associated with.

'I was embarrassed at first, and then worried - so was my mum. I don’t want someone taking and editing my pictures to use for a porn site.

'There was at least two or three photos. It made me feel very exposed.'

'Exposed': Miss Marr was told be a family friend who saw her pictures online. Several had been used

Miss Marr, from Liphook, Hampshire, has now updated her privacy settings on Facebook and has warned people to change their passwords once every month.

'The whole experience was creepy and gross,' she told student newspaper The Tab.

'There are no lewd pictures of me online, but I hate to think what they edited on the ones they took.

'I didn’t know what else was out there then or might still be out there now.

'It was a really creepy thing to do. Trawling the internet looking for a teenager’s pictures is just bizarre.

'I want people to be aware of this so it doesn’t happen to them in future as it was a very unpleasant experience.

'I would urge other girls to keep their profiles locked down and to change their passwords every month.'
