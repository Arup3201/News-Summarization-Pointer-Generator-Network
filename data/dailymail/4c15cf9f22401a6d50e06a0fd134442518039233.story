The number of estate agents has soared to a record high with one in four jobs created in the past year in the property sector, according to official figures.

According to the Office for National Statistics, the number of jobs in the sector rose to 562,000 in the second quarter of the year, exceeding the 2008 peak and the most since its records began in the late 1970s.

The figure was up by 77,000 compared with the same period last year

The statistics suggest that Britain’s current growth is being driven by a new housing boom.

The sector, which includes estate agents and property developers, is growing so quickly it has amounted to the fastest growing segment of national workforce in the three months ending in June.

The total number of new jobs in the economy during the same period was 334,000.

The data will add to fears that the country is heading for a house price bubble.

Danny Gabay, director of economics consultancy Fathom, said: ‘We’re no longer a nation of shopkeepers – we’re becoming a nation of estate agents,’

‘I would certainly agree that the economy has turned a corner; my concern is about how sustainable this recovery will be, given that it is based on using government subsidies to encourage already over-extended households to take on even more debt to finance their consumption.’

Concerns over the housing market boom were echoed by Business Secretary Vince Cable who urged Chancellor George Osborne to rethink his Help to Buy scheme, which will provide mortgage guarentees for small deposit mortgages from the New Year.

He told Sky News: 'We should certainly think about how it should come into effect; indeed whether it should come into effect, in the light of changing market conditions.

'We don't want a new housing bubble.'

But Downing Street insisted that the launch of the scheme will go ahead as planned.

The scheme was announced as part of Mr Osborne's budget back in March but has attracted some criticism amid fears it will drive up housing prices but not boost supply.

The scheme will offer state-backed guarantees on mortgages worth up to £600,000 for buyers required to put down 20 per cent or less of the total price of the property.
