Mario Balotelli will sign a three-year contract with Liverpool on Monday ahead of their mouthwatering Premier League clash with Manchester City.

Brendan Rodgers' side face Balotelli's former employers at the Etihad Stadium and will be boosted by the announcement before the match that the Italian has become a Liverpool player.

The 24-year-old, who will move from Italian giants AC Milan in a £16million deal, arrived at Melwood on Monday afternoon to put the finishing touches to the transfer.

How is was: Balotelli playing against Liverpool in the colours of Manchester City back in August 2012

He travelled to Liverpool's Melwood training ground last week and completed both parts of his medical.

Balotelli has agreed a three-year, heavily incentivised £90,000-per-week contract and Mino Raiola, the forward’s long-term adviser, has urged him to seize the opportunity.

Having already played for Manchester City, Inter Milan and AC Milan it is unlikely Balotelli will get another big move if he fails to settle at Liverpool.

During his time at the Etihad, Balotelli netted 30 goals in 80 appearances.

He also scored 18 goals in 41 matches for Milan last season.

Milan themselves are continuing to look for a replacement for Balotelli.

Jackson Martinez of Porto was their prime objective but 33-year-old Samuel Eto'o is now back on the Italians' agenda.

Eto'o has strong interest from Everton but his free-agent status allows him to move once the window is closed.

Milan have also added City's Alvaro Negredo to their extensive list of potential targets.

Rodgers, meanwhile, is giving a trial to Israeli midfielder Michael Ohana at Liverpool.

The 18-year-old currently plays for Ashdod. 

Top target: Milan ideally would like to replace Balotelli with Porto striker Jackson Martinez this summer

Interest: Manchester City forward Alvaro Negredo could move to AC Milan as a replacement for Balotelli

Keen: Former Chelsea forward Samuel Eto'o is another forward who is interesting the Serie A giants
