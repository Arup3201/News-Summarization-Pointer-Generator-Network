Do you often get the feeling of déjà vu, possibly feeling like your days are becoming a little samey? Well this could be down to your daily routine, a new survey has revealed.

Three quarters of us Brits stick to a strict daily ritual, from having the same things for breakfast every day to going to bed at the same time and even staying loyal to a particular mug.

Research shows that many of us have become set in our ways and are reluctant to change our daily habits - however this fear of leaving our comfort zone has left us feeling trapped.

Many Brits feel as though their lives are like Groundhog day with many of us sticking to the same routine, such as going to bed and waking up at the same time

Many of us admit to buying the same brands of food and drink, as well as frequenting the same restaurants and we are devoted to certain shops and supermarkets.

Researchers also found that our 
hairstyle is the thing we are least likely to change, with one in 
five admitting they've had the same hairstyle for a decade.

Three in ten of us even went as far to admit that we have become so comfortable in our routine that we are left feeling 'scared' to try new things.

This comes from a study carried out to mark the launch of Clipper Teas campaign, that encorages us to try a new brew. However it seems that many of us will be sticking to our old bags as ten per cent of Brits claim they've stuck to one brand their whole lives.

Life Coach Amanda Brown, says our refusal to change is to do with our sense of security.

'We stick with what we know for a number of reasons: it's easy, we feel safe and secure, or we simply don't imagine anything different to what we already have.

'Change is a word that seems to strike fear in people when actually change is a really positive thing.'

Some of us have even become loyal to a breakfast cereal

However, it seems we're much more at 
ease with making big life-changing decisions, with the results of Clipper's research showing 
Brits are twice as likely to have dumped their partner in the last ten 
years as they are to have changed their brand of tea bag.

And while a fifth of respondents have changed jobs in the last ten years, just one in ten have given a new moisturiser a go.

'We find big changes in life easier to tackle than small changes because we approach them in different ways' says Amanda.

'Big
 changes are often the result of us wanting something different, a new 
job, house, car or a relationship. We find it easier to change things if
 we don't like something because we can see pleasure in the change.'

Despite many of us finding it tricky to 
transform our routines, it seems that many of us are not satisfied with 
our repetitive lifestyles.

The study from Clipper tea showed that 74 per cent feel like every day is Groundhog Day, with nine in ten adults saying they often follow the same routines every single day.

Eight in ten believe they 
would actually benefit from making small changes to their everyday life,
 with three quarters wishing they could find a way to escape their 
comfort zone.

Just under half the respondents said that they liked sticking with what they know but 32 per cent were worried about what might happen if they decided to mix things up a bit.

Amanda added that although we find it hard
 to change smaller things in our lives it is often a good idea as it can
 build our confidence.

'When
 we change tiny things such as a shade of lipstick or our brand of tea 
we send positive messages to the brain that we can make change happen 
every day, which builds our confidence.

'Trying
 something new doesn't mean we lose the comfort zone, it just means 
we've giving something a go, and it's only by trying it first that we 
can decide if we like it or not.'

As well as our day-to-day routine, many of us have gone as far as to become stuck on repeat with our holiday choices.

Monarch
 airlines found that we tend to stick with where we know with eight in 
ten Brits having returned to a holiday destination twice or more.

The most common reasons behind the repetitive getaways are weather, food and the length of flight, while others said they enjoyed being on first name terms with staff and local people.

And one in seven said they return to the same resort time after time because they like its family friendly element and the fact it caters well for children.

It also emerged that Spain, The Canary Islands and France are the destinations we are most likely to return to.

Andrew Swaffield, Managing Director of Monarch Airlines who commissioned the study, said:

'It's easy to return to the same holiday destination year after year.

'If you know your way around and know what to expect then it does make things more straight forward.

'And the research shows that Brits like a familiar face and look forward to catching up with local proprietors each year.'

It sometimes even comes down to traveling the same week or fortnight of the year, every year.

Andrew went on to say that we even have routines once we're away.

'Knowing
 where to eat, how much money to take and knowing that young children 
will be entertained are all plus points to returning to the same resort.'

He
 says that although it may be easier to stick with what you know it is 
also important to try something new every once in a while.

'It's important not to get stuck in a holiday rut and not broaden your horizons.'

Many of the repeat visitors claimed that their price range kept them in stuck in the same holiday destination.
