Troublemakers arrested for being drunk and disorderly could be sent on a course to boost their self-esteem - at taxpayers’ expense.

Under the scheme, offenders can be arrested up to five times and still escape court proceedings provided they attend a one-day session designed to help them reflect on their self image.

The course will be launched next month in York, reportedly a flagship measure in the local council's effort to curb the city’s growing binge drinking culture.

Self image: As part of the taxpayer-funded course, those arrested for being drunk and disorderly in York will be encouraged to reflect on their behaviour in an effort to boost their self-esteem (file image)

Council bosses say rather than just focus on booze the 18-month pilot scheme will encourage the troublemakers to reflect on their 'behaviour and self-image'.

Jonathan Isaby, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: 'This is a farcical waste of taxpayers’ money...Those who go out, get tanked up and then disrupt the peace should be dealt with by the police, not sent on a self-image course.'

He added: 'Politicians should focus on easing the burden on ordinary, responsible drinkers rather than mollycoddling those causing trouble.'

A council report says: 'The project will be aimed at York residents who have been arrested for public order and drunkenness offences (maximum of 5 offences).'

'Those who are alcohol dependent, who have mental health issues or are prolific offenders, will be excluded... The individual will be bailed for 14 days and then given the option to attend a day long course, in which case the bail will be cancelled,' it added.

'If the option of the course is not taken up, then the person will be charged for the offence,' the report went on.

The course will be provided by Lifeline and will encourage people to reflect on their behaviour and self-image, rather than purely alcohol issues.

As part of the scheme, students at York University will be given tips on sensible drinking due to concerns about the number of drunken freshers clogging up York Hospital's A&E department (pictured)

Previous studies have shown that the impact of the course lasts for about a year, after which participants typically go back to offending.

The report say once 12 months have passed, text message alerts (written by themselves on the course) after this time to keep up motivation,' the report adds.

Funding has been provided by the North Yorkshire Substance Misuse Partnership, which will allow for the course to be initially free.

The Partnership receives national funding allocation from the Department of Health to help local people battle addiction.

But a charge could be introduced at a later date. York University has agreed to see how The Alcohol Referral Project measures up.

Ironically, the university is also being targeted in the crackdown. Students are to be given tips on sensible drinking due to concerns about the number of drunken freshers clogging up York Hospital’s A&E department.

British Transport Police have also beefed up the number of officers on trains into York because of a craze by female passengers to tank up on booze before going out for the night.

Councillor Linsay Cunningham-Cross, City of York Council’s Cabinet Member for Crime and Stronger Communities, said: “Sending speeding drivers on safe driving courses requires them to take time out of their normal routine and really consider the impact of their actions.

'It’s an approach we’re considering because it brings about real behavioural change. 

'This is about finding the most effective way of tackling the issue and saving money in the long run - those sent on courses will have to bear the cost themselves - and supports what we’re looking to achieve with our review of York’s night-time economy.'
