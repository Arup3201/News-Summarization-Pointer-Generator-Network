Poland's Kwiatkowski (Omega Pharma-QuickStep) won the sprint for the line at the end of the 184.6-kilometre route from Worcester to take the yellow jersey.

Holland's Albert Timmer (Giant-Shimano) was frustrated with second after being prominent throughout the stage and Belgium's Dylan Teuns (BMC Racing) was third.

The time bonus which accompanied the win saw Kwiatkowski move three seconds ahead of Edoardo Zardini (Bardiani CSF) in the overall standings.

Teuns is third, Ireland's Nicolas Roche (Tinkoff-Saxo) sits fourth, 14 seconds behind, with defending champion Sir Bradley Wiggins (Team Sky) sixth, 27 seconds adrift, ahead of Thursday's fifth stage in Devon.

Wiggins finished in the bunch behind Team Sky colleague Ben Swift, who was six seconds behind Kwiatkowski in seventh.
