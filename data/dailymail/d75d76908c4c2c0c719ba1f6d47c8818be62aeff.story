British troops were given a little 
taste of home today as they were treated to a traditional Christmas 
dinner with all the trimmings - in the middle of the Afghan desert.

More than eight tonnes of food was 
imported from the UK to Afghanistan so soldiers on the frontline could 
enjoy Christmas, despite being thousands of miles from their families.

Five tonnes of turkey and gammon and a
tonne of sprouts were polished off by more than 9,500 personnel 
stationed throughout the British area of operations, the Ministry of 
Defence (MoD) said.

All the trimmings: More than eight tonnes of food was specially imported from the UK so troops could enjoy a Christmas dinner

Frontline feast: Troops queue to pile their plate with a turkey dinner in Lashkar Gar, Afghanistan, as a 'Santa' looks on

A taste of home: They might be miles from Britain, but the soldiers were given a flavour of a traditional Christmas with this dinner

Also on the menu were 900 Christmas cakes, 21,500 mince pies, 30,000 After Eight mints and 155,000 buffet items.

And more than 200 Christmas trees, 
1,000 sets of decorations and 16,000 Christmas crackers are helping keep
up the festive cheer, the MoD said.

Warrant
Officer Class 2 (WO2) Russell 'Frog' Leigh, of 16 Regiment Royal 
Artillery, 37, from Wigan, said: 'The best part of Christmas here has 
been singing carols with my mates, but the food is absolutely phenomenal
as well.

'I can't believe 
they can get every part of the full Christmas feast with all the 
trimmings here. There is a brilliant atmosphere as well.'

The
MoD has also helped the charity uk4uThanks! send Christmas boxes to 
troops all over the world, meaning more than 22,500 servicemen and women
got an extra gift thanks to money donated by the British public.

Jamie Metcalfe-Tarren, from 1st Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment, is 
spending his third Christmas deployed on operations in Afghanistan.

The 31-year-old, from Huddersfield, 
said: 'It's always difficult being away from family and friends for 
Christmas, but it helps being with friends who are all in the same boat 
and make the best of things.

'The
food is always brilliant but we are lucky to be in a main operating 
base like Lashkar Gah. Our thoughts are with the boys out in the austere
conditions of patrol bases and checkpoints and I hope they can enjoy 
some break from operations.

'It's
great to have the support of people back home, and at the very least, 
we have the boxes from uk4u, which have some great things, alongside 
some obscure ones!'

Major Pete Cowell, 39, from 1st Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment, is spending his first Christmas away from his children.

Maj
Cowell, from Bristol, said: 'This is hard this year as I am away from 
the family, but in many ways it is harder for those back home.

'We treat this as much as possible as another normal day, but for them it is a festive day without their dad or husband.'

Christmas carols: A special service was also held at Camp Tombstone in Afghanistan, giving soldiers the opportunity to participate in a religious Christian ceremony

Task Force Helmand spokesman 
Lieutenant Colonel Gordon Mackenzie said: 'Being deployed at Christmas 
is always difficult and it is the time you miss your family the most.

'But the efforts to bring Christmas cheer to all those on operations who cannot be at home are hugely appreciated here.

'Although
we all understand that we're here to do a job and operations take 
priority, everyone appreciates the opportunity to enjoy themselves.

'It'll never be the same as a Christmas at home, but the little things do make a massive difference.'

For
the soldiers of the 2nd Battalion the Rifles Regiment, the Christmas 
feast at Camp Tombstone, inside Camp Bastion, marked the end of a 
two-week operation with partners from the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF).

The 2 Rifles currently advise the Afghan National Army (ANA) 3/215 Brigade, commanded by Brigadier General Sheren Shah.

The singing soldiers: Hundreds of troops gathered to belt out Christmas carols, with General Sir Peter Wall, the Chief of the General Staff (CGS) in attendance

Boosting morale: The Christmas effort was important for comradeship especially at a time when thoughts were with those at home, MoD chiefs said

They have been involved in a successful operation to clear and secure the central district of Nad e-Ali in Helmand Province.

Officers and soldiers today received Christmas presents from 'Santa Claus', played by Colour Sergeant Major Kev Diggle, from Leeds, then attended a carol service, before enjoying a Christmas Day dinner, attended by General Shah.

Lieutenant Colonel Bill Wright, commanding officer of 2 Rifles, said: 'I am relieved that we all got back in safely from what was a very successful operation with the ANSF with enough time to shower and prepare ourselves for today.

'It is great for the officers and soldiers of the Brigade Advisory Group (BAG) to sit and relax over a splendid dinner and recharge their batteries.

'This is about comradeship and especially at a time when our thoughts are with those at home. I think they have just as hard a task as us, sorting out Christmas Day without us there.

'Morale is high and we will more than make up for missing Christmas at home this year in 2012.'
