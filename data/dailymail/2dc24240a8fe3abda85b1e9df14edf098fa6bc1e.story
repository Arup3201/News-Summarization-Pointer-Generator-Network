Swansea have revived talks and agreed a fee with Marseille for Dimitri Payet.

Marseille are happy to sell for £6.5million but the 27-year-old winger is unsure about the move.

The Welsh club are also interested in West Ham target Timothee Kolodziejczak, the Nice left-back.

Agreed: Swansea agree a fee for Marseille's Dimitri Payet, but the winger isn't yet sure of the move

Targeted: And Crystal Palace are chasing Jonjo Shelvey

Meanwhile, Crystal Palace maintain an interest in Swansea midfielder Jonjo Shelvey.

The 22-year-old made 32 appearances in the Premier League last season, scoring six goals.

The Eagles are hoping to strengthen their midfield option with Jose Campana finalising his move to Sampdoria.
