Andy Coulson and five others are facing prison for their roles in what prosecutors called a ‘pervasive’ culture of phone hacking at the News of the World.

Under Mr Coulson’s editorship, the phone messages of actors, celebrities, and politicians were intercepted on ‘an industrial scale’. Police identified 4,000 possible victims.

The hacking scandal began to unravel in 2007, when royal reporter Clive Goodman and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire were jailed for intercepting the voicemails of members of the Royal Household.

Facing jail: Former News of the World editor and No.10 spin doctor Andy Coulson may face jail along with five others, after he was found guilty of phone hacking

Initially News International insisted the practice was limited to one ‘rogue reporter’. But that defence crumbled after emails disclosed in a series of civil actions for damages exposed a wider conspiracy.

By last October – at the start of this trial – the scale of the hacking plot became clear when the Old Bailey was told that three former news editors at the newspaper were among five men who pleaded guilty to their part in the hacking plot.

Senior executives Greg Miskiw, 64, James Weatherup, 58, and Neville Thurlbeck, 52, all admitted playing a part in a six-year campaign of phone hacking which targeted politicians, pop stars and members of the Royal Family.

Mulcaire, 43, who was paid £100,000 a year by the paper to arrange the hacking, admitted intercepting the voicemails of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler, among a host of other victims.

At an earlier hearing, he also 
admitted three counts of conspiracy to commit phone hacking after police
 found ‘thousands and thousands of pages’ of notes relating to his 
victims.

And reporter Dan 
Evans, who appeared as a witness for the prosecution in the hacking 
trial, confessed to hacking Sienna Miller’s messages on actor Daniel 
Craig’s phone.

He has admitted conspiracy to hack phones at the Sunday Mirror between February 2003 and January 2005, and the same offence at the News of the World between April 2004 and June 2010.

He also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office and perverting the course of justice.

They will be sentenced alongside Coulson after he was found  guilty yesterday of conspiring to hack phones.

They each face a maximum sentence of two years for the phone hacking.

The former News of the World Editor, whose affair with Mrs Brooks was sensationally revealed during the trial when excerpts from a deeply personal letter from his co-defendant were read to the jury, will face sentencing shortly after the trial finally ends.

At that point, it is likely that Miskiw, Weatherup, Thurlbeck and Mulcaire will be brought back to court to be told their fate.

The jury heard that phone hacking was so widespread at the News of the World that senior journalists even used a special hotline for ‘do-it-yourself hacking’ and targeted rival journalists.

Celebrities who were hacked include Sir Paul McCartney and his then wife Heather Mills, as well as Jude Law and Miller, his girlfriend at the time.

Kate Moss, Will Young and Joanna Lumley were targeted too.

Mulcaire admitted recording voicemail messages belonging to former Home Secretary David Blunkett and British nanny Louise Woodward, who was convicted of killing a child in the US in the 1990s.

News UK – the British newspaper publishing arm of Rupert Murdoch’s media empire – said it had put in place measures to ensure that the wrongdoing at the News of the World could not happen again.

‘We said long ago, and repeat today, that wrongdoing occurred, and we apologised for it.

‘We have been paying compensation to those affected and have co-operated with investigations,’ the company said. ‘We made changes in the way we do business to help ensure wrongdoing like this does not occur again.’

Brian Cathcart from lobby group Hacked Off, which campaigns for state-imposed regulation of the Press, said: ‘For years the Murdoch press clung to the story that one rogue reporter was responsible for phone hacking. We now know this was a lie.

‘Far from being an isolated incident involving a few “bad apples”, the trial has shown that the entire orchard was rotten.’

Guilty verdict: Andy Coulson at the Old Bailey on Tuesday

David Cameron endured 
searching new questions  yesterday over the failure of officials to vet 
disgraced spin doctor Andy Coulson to the highest level.

Coulson
 – who became Downing Street’s chief spin doctor in 2010 – was not 
security-vetted to the same level as his predecessors and successors.

Instead,
 the former tabloid editor was vetted to ‘security check’ level, which 
allows only supervised access to the most secret government documents. 
He resigned before a stricter ‘developed vetting (DV)’ clearance process
 had been completed.

Of the
 Downing Street communications directors before Coulson, three were 
already vetted to the DV level, two others were granted the status three
 months after starting the job and another after seven months.

Mr
 Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne hired Coulson as the 
Conservatives’ director of communications only weeks after he quit the 
News of the World in 2007, saying he took ‘ultimate responsibility’ when
 royal editor Clive Goodman pleaded guilty to phone hacking.

Labour
 leader Ed Miliband revelled in Coulson’s downfall yesterday and asked 
why he had not gone through the full vetting process earlier.

Mr
 Miliband said: ‘I think David Cameron must do much more than an 
apology. He owes the country an explanation for why he did not act on 
these allegations against Andy Coulson, why – as the evidence piled up –
 he didn’t do anything about.

‘He
 doesn’t seem to have received the most comprehensive security vetting 
and clearance. We need to know why that didn’t happen.’

Mr
 Coulson’s background had been probed by a private company contracted by
 the Conservative Party when he began work as its head of communications
 in 2007. But it was decided to commence ‘developed vetting’ of Mr 
Coulson only after he had to brief the media on a terror alert at the 
East Midlands airport in October 2010. This had not been completed when 
Coulson resigned in January 2011.

Under
 Mr Cameron’s premiership, current director of communications Craig 
Oliver has been develop vetted, as has Gabby Bertin – Coulson’s deputy.

No
 10 pointed out that Lord Justice Leveson concluded in his inquiry 
report that the Civil Service decides what levels of security clearance 
staff require.

Last night 
Gordon Brown’s spin doctor Damian McBride, who resigned over a smear 
campaign against opponents, attacked the Tories for ’equating my 
behaviour – however reprehensible – with the criminal activities for 
which Andy Coulson has just been convicted’. He added: ‘I had to undergo
 the developed vetting process, and have my finances, love life and past
 activities thoroughly looked through by the security services. I was 
not allowed to start doing the job properly until I’d received my DV 
status.

‘Why was Coulson not put through developed vetting for the director of communications job in No 10?’

But
 Whitehall sources said it was unlikely a ‘developed vetting’ process 
would have uncovered any fresh evidence about Coulson and phone hacking.

The
 Tory leadership had been dreading the conclusion of the Coulson trial 
for months, since Mr Cameron had vowed to make a full public apology if 
he was convicted. Mr Cameron admitted at the Leveson Inquiry that his 
decision to hire Coulson had ‘haunted’ them both.

Coulson,
 however, insisted the question of voicemail interception was raised 
only once by Mr Cameron during his recruitment – in a phone call while 
he was on holiday in Cornwall.

Downing
 Street said Coulson had given assurances to the police, Press 
Complaints Commission and a Commons select committee that he knew 
nothing of hacking.

Mr 
Osborne said: ‘I too am very sorry for the decision we made to employ 
Andy Coulson. He gave us assurances that turned out not to be the case. 
We gave him a second chance but, knowing what we now know, it’s clear 
that we made the wrong decision.’

Mr
 Clegg said he warned Mr Cameron about the hiring of Coulson. He said he
 took the PM to one side when the Coalition was formed in 2010 and 
questioned why Coulson was a Downing Street communications director.
