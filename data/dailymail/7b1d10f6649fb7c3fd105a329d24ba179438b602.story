Fans have slammed X Factor's cruel new twist after the show's contestants had their dream snatched away from them at last minute.

Viewers were 'outraged' with the new format which saw the judges forced to whittle down 100 contestants in all their categories to just 24.

This year, for the first time in the show's history, the singers had to battle it out on stage in a ‘musical chairs’ style section which saw performers face the threat of being ousted by a better singer or group.

Through: Sam Callahan was one of the lucky ones who was given one of the coveted seats to take him through to the next round

Angry fans took to Twitter to slam the new format, comparing the duelling round to The Hunger Games, a novel and film which televises 12 
children battling to the death for viewers' entertainment.

Fan Kenny Doughty wrote on Twitter: 'X Factor is turning into Hunger Games. It's like pulling wings off flies. Cruel Process. Poor kids.'

@elizabethhmae wrote: 'X factor makes me so MAD. Next we'll genuinely be having the Hunger Games for real, people seem to do anything for money and entertainment.'

And Josh Lawlor added: 'Is this x factor or the hunger games bc i really cant tell????'

Gem Sutherland also voiced her concerns on the show, writing: 'X factor is cruel. It's like hunger games. Giving someone a seat then taking it away. How far will X factor go to get ratings.'

Following this, Natalie Leatham wrote: 'The new format is disgusting. Giving someone their dreams and then taking it away in minutes.'

Gareth Birth summed up with: 'X Factor is a disgrace. Destroying and humiliating teenagers in front of millions of viewers.'

The show's new format even prompted a reaction from celberity views with Olly Murs writing on Twitter: wrote: 'NEW bootcamp style on @TheXFactor UK was awesome!!! Not great for the contestants but watching it... Un-real!! Girl category is Pucka!!'

But singer Lily Allen blasted: 'When did become alright to f*** with peoples minds. X factor has got fully mean.'

Despite viewers' anger the ITV show still managed to attract an average audience of 9.5 million viewers, with a peak of 10.9 million on Sunday evening.

Cruel process: Popular Lydia Lucy had taken her seat on one of the six chairs, but was harshly replaced by Abi Alton when Nicole decided to take her through instead

Judges were forced to decide straight after the contestant's performance whether to take them through or not.

Those who got a yes, took a seat in the final six chairs on the stage.

But
if the judges wanted to send another act through once their six spots 
were full they had to option of ditching one of the hopefuls who had 
already been given a 'yes'.

Lydia Lucy, from Essex, Sheena McHugh and Karen Harding all lost their seats after Nicole had already put them through.

Nicole
was torn as to whether to take Sheena through she said: 'Sheena you are
the only person that has made me cry today so I’m going to go with my 
heart. Take a seat.'

Deflated: Alejandro Fernandez-Holt sung his heart out on the show, winning a seat, but he was replaced by Nicholas McDonald after his stirring rendition I Won't Give Up by Jason Mraz

Heartbreak: Stephanie is inconsolable after being sent home by Nicole

However just a few minutes later, after Hannah Barrett performed, Nicole loved Hannah’s vocal so much that she instantaneously decided to eliminate Sheena and replace her with Barrett for judges houses.

Last night there was even more disappointment when Sabrina Rumikie, Katie Markham, Tenors of Roack and Alejandro Fernandez Holt were also eliminated.

When Gary remarked that he would drop singer Joseph Whelan from the line-up, dad-of-one Joe burst into tears and while pacing the stage weeping and pleading 'not again' – as he was previously ditched from the show during last year’s Boot Camp stage.

But judges Gary Barlow, Nicole 
Scherzinger, Louis Walsh and Sharon Osbourne did manage to cut down 
their contestants from 100 to just 24 as a result of the process. These final six in each category will now go through to the 'Judges Houses' stage of the competition.

Returning 
hopefuls Melanie, Amy and Stephanie had the biggest opportunity to 
impress the judges with a rendition of Destiny's Child hit Survivor 
during a sing off to determine which of them should sing alone.

However, the performance had Nicole, Gary, Sharon and Louis divided over Stephanie - whose vocals were out-shined.

'I just don't know, I feel like the other voices were stronger,' said Nicole after asking the girls to wait backstage.

'You
wouldn't want to give her another chance?' pleaded Sharon, who 
previously admitted to having a soft spot for the 20-year-old after 
taking her to judges houses six-years ago.

However, a determined Nicole resolved to give her the red card.

Karen Harding was next up, and she impressed with a rousing version of fun. hit We Are Young after taking to the stage in a striking mini-dress. 

'I like you and I like your voice, but is Nicole gonna pick you? I don't know,' said Louis. 

'You have a beautiful, rich tone to your voice but I don't know if I would've picked that song for you, but Karen.... take a seat you're in my top six!' said Nicole.

But despite filling up all her six seats being taken, there were three performances to go - meaning Nicole could take advantage of the new twist and swap one girl for another. 

First up was Hannah Barrett, who made an impassioned plea after taking to the stage: 'Everything I've been through, I tell you I'm not going back there!' she cried.

Stern words: Nicole loses it backstage after a string of mediocre performances

Her performance of Etta James hit I'd Rather Go Blind had Nicole raising her hands in delight - and posed a serious conundrum for the former Pussycat Doll.

Next up was 18-year-old supermarket worker Abi Alton, whose nerves almost got the better of her before she performed.

'It's
interesting because that's not the song I would have chosen for you. 
Ultimately it's my decision. Abi, I want you in my top six." said Nicole.

'Obviously that means somebody has to 
lose their seat....Okay, the person who's going to lose their seat in my
top six is...Lydia.'

Things got off to a promising start with prison officer Sam Bailey impressing the judges with a version of Emelie Sande's Clown that had the fiery judge up on her feet. 

'That was absolutely note perfect,' said Gary.

'I just want you to know that of all the years I've been involved and not involved in this show I've dreamed of a contestant like you,' added a tearful Sharon. 'I've come to  a decision...yes, put your bum on that seat.'

After a moment of comedy from good natured Souli Roots, who performed Michael Jackson's Man in the Mirror before being given her marching orders, it was call center worker Jayson Newland's chance to shine - and shine he did, with a moving version of Steve Winwood classic Higher Love.

'That's called taking a risk, and it paid off,' said Gary.

However, Sharon  wasn't convinced.

'My darling you should be very proud of your self because that was a really solid performance,' she said. 'However, I'm not sure and my decision is...I'm going to send you home.'

Sabrina Ramikie, 28, took the next seat with a performance of I'd rather Go Blind.

'It was a flawless performance and my decision is...' said Sharon, pointing to one of the empty chairs.

Two down and proud dad of one Joseph Whelan came next, a year after he failed to impress the judges during boot camp.

After a performance of Iris by the Goo Goo Dolls, Sharon told the emotional builder: 'I know this means a lot to you. I need people who are gonna be strong - I don''t need wimps.

'My decision is that you are going to have to go and join the ladies on the seat.'
