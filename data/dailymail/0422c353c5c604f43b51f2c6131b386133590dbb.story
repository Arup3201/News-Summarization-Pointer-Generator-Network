A schoolgirl rape victim is to hire a private detective to track down her attacker, who has been on the run abroad for more than a year after being granted bail.

The young Midlands victim was left distraught after Portuguese national Antonio Pedro de Alves, 41, fled the UK just days before his trial last May. He was convicted of raping the then 12-year-old in his absence and sentenced to 11 years.

But more than a year on and de Alves has not been traced, despite an international arrest warrant being issued.

Now the girl's mother has revealed that her determined daughter plans to hire a private detective to track down de Alves because of the apparent lack of progress in the case by Staffordshire Police.

The victim, now 15, plans to fund the hunt from money due to be awarded to her by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board.

Her mother said: 'We do not know if police have any leads, any sightings, or even if they have spoken lately to police in Portugal, where we believe he is probably living. For my daughter, her life is in limbo.

'She cannot move on while the man who abused her is walking free.

'She is due to receive money ... early next year. She plans to use some of that to hire a private detective to see if they can trace her rapist.

'I am disgusted that she feels she has to do this, but she thinks this could help bring him to justice.'

De Alves was living in Rugeley, Staffordshire, when he first contacted his victim via the social website Bebo, claiming to be a sports-loving 15-year-old.

Skipped bail: De Alves, 41, was due to stand trial for rape at Stafford Crown Court but was granted bail

Over months he groomed the youngster online and eventually convinced her to meet in a supermarket car park in Cannock. But when the schoolgirl arrived de Alves claimed that he was a relative of the 15-year-old boy, who he said had asked him to meet her because he was running late.

The youngster was suspicious and tried to flee, but de Alves pulled her into his car where the attack took place. The schoolgirl reported the attack to police in December 2011 and de Alves was arrested the following January and his computers seized.

He was charged in January 2013, but was inexplicably granted bail. He fled abroad shortly before his trial last May.

The mother said: 'The police investigation from the very beginning seemed slow and it has all been such a long, drawn out process. We couldn't believe he was allowed bail after being charged, as he was a foreign national who could easily slip abroad.

'My daughter has been so brave, and is now slowly rebuilding her life and hopes to eventually start a university course. We are all so proud of her but she deserves justice.'

Staffordshire Police issued a statement last night: 'A warrant was issued by the courts after de Alves failed to appear and officers from a specialist investigation team began inquiries to locate de Alves using a variety of tactics. Inquiries are ongoing and Staffordshire officers are in continuous contact with foreign authorities via the National Crime Agency and Interpol.

'While we are making inquiries to locate de Alves we do not have jurisdiction, or power in law, to go to another country until their law enforcement officers have detained the wanted individual. Our officers have supplied the relevant authorities with a significant amount of information and our work with them is ongoing.'

The police also insisted the family were 'happy' at the updates they are receiving from the force.

'After hearing of the victim's family's initial dissatisfaction at lack of contact after the court date we agreed a communication method with a single point of contact and remain committed to updating them with any investigative developments. They understand and are happy that this will only be when there is significant news.'

But the mother said: 'The police family liaison officers have been wonderful, but there is only so much they can tell us.

'Since de Alves's conviction we have had very little feedback from police about their search for him and have heard nothing substantial about the investigation for months. We have been left in the dark.'

The West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service confirmed that following Alves's conviction and sentencing, an international warrant had been issued for his arrest and passed on to police.
