Referendum plan: Germany's Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has admitted that closer integration between EU states could only go ahead with a 'yes' vote from the German public

David Cameron is facing renewed pressure to hold a referendum on  Britain’s membership of the EU after Germany said it would let its people have one.

German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said yesterday that closer integration in Europe could only go ahead with a ‘yes’ vote from the German people.

Later this week, the EU Commission will press for closer banking union at a summit in Brussels in a desperate bid to raise market confidence in Europe. The plans, which represent a step towards a European banking super-state, include an EU-wide guarantee scheme for bank deposits and a single bank regulator.

In an interview with German newspaper Der Spiegel, Mr Schaeuble acknowledged that a referendum would be needed to cede national sovereignty to Brussels.

He said: ‘I assume that it will happen sooner than I would have thought a few months ago. 

‘At the EU summit, the heads of four European institutions plan to present concrete proposals for greater integration. We will see what happens after that.’

Mr Schaeuble also called for an EU 
finance minister, with powers to veto national budgets, stronger powers 
for the European Parliament and an elected European Commission 
president.

The comments mean Mr Cameron will have
to confront fresh calls from his own party to hold a referendum on 
Britain’s EU membership.

Up for a fight: David Cameron has promised to battle attempts to get Britain to join the banking union

Tory MP Mark Reckless said: ‘This certainly increases the pressure on David Cameron to hold an in-out referendum and it is now a case of when, rather than if.’

His colleague George Eustice MP said: ‘It is very unusual for Germany to hold a referendum and this shows that they recognise the gravity of this decision.’

The summit on Thursday and Friday could be marred by attempts to force all 27 EU member states to submit to Continent-wide banking regulation.

Mr Cameron has promised to fight attempts to get Britain to join the banking union, although Britain is urging the 17-nation eurozone to fully integrate its fiscal and banking policies to reassure investors in the single currency.

Earlier this month, the Prime Minister dismissed as ‘nonsense’ a suggestion from German chancellor Angela Merkel that the EU should work towards a single national identity. And a spokesman for Angela Merkel suggested that a referendum could be some way off.
