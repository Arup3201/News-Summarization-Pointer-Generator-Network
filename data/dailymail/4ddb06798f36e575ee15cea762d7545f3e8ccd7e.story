Arsenal were left furious after being denied a clear penalty for a foul on Chuba Akpom.

The striker was through on goal when Monaco keeper Danijel Subasic brought him down two yards inside the penalty box.

Referee Martin Atkinson originally pointed to the spot but after checking with his linesman awarded a free-kick to Arsenal.

Changing his mind: Referee Martin Atkinson changes his mind and awards a free-kick

Several Arsenal players voiced their frustrations but Atkinson pointed at the linesman indicating that he informed him that it was a free-kick. 

Arsenal's subsequent free-kick hit the wall and Monaco were easily able to clear. 

It proved a frustrating end to the Emirates Cup for Arsene Wenger's side as they lost 1-0 to big-spending French side. 

New signings Alexis Sanchez, Calum Chambers and Mathieu Debuchy all started the game but it was Radamel Falcao who stole the headlines with a first-half header to win the game.

The result means Arsenal finished the tournament in second place as Valencia - who beat Benfica 3-1 earlier on Sunday - finished top of the four-team group.
