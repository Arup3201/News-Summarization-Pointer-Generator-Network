Tonka trucks were always a bit on the chunky side.

But the toy maker would be hard-pressed to match this monster – the biggest dumper truck in the world.

It is more than 65ft long, 26ft high and can carry 450 tons of debris. It can even thunder along at 40mph.

The Belaz 75710 was unveiled today and its makers in the former Soviet republic of Belarus plan to submit it for inclusion in the Guinness Book of Records.

Its two diesel engines develop a combined 4,600bhp, the same as four Bugatti Veyron SuperSports cars.
