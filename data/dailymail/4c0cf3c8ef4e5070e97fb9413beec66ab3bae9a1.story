Palestinians were today picking up the pieces of their trashed homes after Israeli troops swept through the West Bank in the hunt for three missing Jewish teenagers.

Soldiers charged into homes in cities and refugee camps across the eastern Palestinian territory, turning over furniture and taking away 41 suspected Hamas members.

To the east, in Gaza, homes and workplaces were shattered by a fourth straight night of Israeli air force bombardment after militants fired rockets into Israeli territory.

Israeli forces have so far arrested around 200 Palestinians, most of them members of Hamas, as it conducts a vast search operation for the three students, two of them minors, who disappeared last week.

They accuse Hamas of kidnapping the three youths after they left their religious school in a Jewish settlement in the occupied territory on Thursday.

While neither claiming nor denying responsibility, Hamas has commented that abductions were a justified response to the plight of thousands of Palestinians - many of them children - held in Israel.

The Palestinian Information Ministry accused Israel of inflicting collective punishment with its West Bank dragnet - a charge echoed by several international human rights groups.

Israel has said it does not know if 
Gil-Ad Shaer and U.S.-Israeli national Naftali Fraenkel, both aged 16, 
and Eyal Yifrah, 19, are alive or what their captors' demands might be.

At
 its meeting on Tuesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's security cabinet agreed to make 
more arrests, put up roadblocks and turn Palestinian houses into 
military observation posts to increase pressure on Hamas, which seeks 
the Jewish state's destruction.

An Israeli official said ministers had also debated a proposal to deport West Bank Hamas leaders to Gaza.

Israeli officials acknowledged the operation was two-fold - recovering the missing teenagers and weakening Hamas.

Earlier, the army said it had detained 41 Hamas militants in overnight raids, raising to more than 200 the number arrested since Friday.

Those
 arrested included the speaker of the Palestinian parliament, Aziz 
Dweik, a senior Hamas figure, who taken in the night from his home in 
Hebron, the West Bank.

Hours
 earlier, a 19-year-old Palestinian, Ahmed Ararat, was shot in the chest
 and killed as Israeli soldiers stormed the Jalazoun refugee camp north 
of Ramallah.

At
 a meeting of the Israeli security cabinet yesterday, ministers decided 
to expand moves against Hamas in order to smash its political and social
 infrastructure in the West Bank, officials said.

A
 series of punitive steps aimed at decapitating Hamas in the West Bank 
were discussed, including the possibility of banishing its senior 
members to Gaza and demolishing their West Bank homes, Israeli media 
reports said.

'As long as 
our boys remain abducted, Hamas will feel pursued, paralysed and 
threatened,' said Lieutenant Peter Lerner, the military's official 
spokesman.

'We are committed
 to resolving the kidnapping and debilitating Hamas terrorist 
capacities, its infrastructure and its recruiting institutions,' he said
 in a statement seen by Reuters.

Reports on Israeli Defence Force radio
 struck a belligerent tone. 'Israel has decided to perform a root canal 
to uproot everything green in the West Bank,' said one, referring to the
 colour representing Hamas.

 Minister Naftali Bennett, who was at the meeting, told army radio that 
Israel had decided to 'dramatically' change its approach to the Islamist
 movement.

'We will bring 
about a situation in which Hamas people will become a nuisance for the 
Palestinian population, and that their presence in Judaea and Samaria 
(the West Bank) will cause harm everywhere,' he said.

'In other words we will turn membership in Hamas into an entry ticket to hell.'

 Hamas was founded in 1987, during the First Intifada uprising against 
Israeli military occupation of the Palestinian Territories.

Nearly 20,000 people have shown their support for a Facebook page calling for Israeli forces to kill a Palestinian 'terrorist' every hour until three missing Jewish teenagers are returned.

The page, in Hebrew, which features images of Palestinian men behind crosshairs, was started a day after the trio disappeared while hitchhiking in Israeli-occupied Palestinian territory.

It appeals to Israelis to eliminate 'terrorists' until the teenagers are found, the International Business Times reports.Â 

It
 has ruled the Gaza strip since winning a decisive majority in elections
 in 2007, but the rival Fatah movement retained control of the West 
Bank. The two parties remained at odds until a recent reconciliation led
 to the swearing in of a Palestinian unity government last week.

Israeli
 newspaper pundits said Israel was using the opportunity of the 
kidnapping to bring about the collapse of the newly-formed unity 
government, which has been furiously denounced by Netanyahu.

Writing in the top-selling Yediot Aharonot, Alex Fishman said the kidnapping had created a 'one-time operational opportunity' which Israel would use 'to castrate' Hamas and suppress its 'strongholds in Palestinian Authority territory to the greatest extent possible.'

By crushing Hamas's infrastructure, it would weaken the movement ahead of Palestinian elections which under the unity deal are supposed to take place before the end of the year, Fishman said.

'Removing the political leadership from the West Bank is supposed to weaken Hamas in advance of the Palestinian presidential elections,' he said.

Writing in Haaretz, Amos Harel agreed. 'The purpose of the Israeli actions ... is to drive a wedge between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas, and stop the reconciliation process that began some two months ago,' he wrote.

But as the manhunt entered its fifth day, commentators voiced concern about growing reports of violence around the West Bank, sparking fears that an already tense situation could rapidly escalate.
