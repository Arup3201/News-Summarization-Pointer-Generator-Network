A 17st teenager is desperate for a gastric band operation on the NHS because cruel taunts about he weight mean she has 'no social life'. 

Brooke Walker, 15, gained weight after eating a diet of junk food as a child, and has now lost her confidence after years of being bullied at school.

Despite trying to eat healthily in her teenage years, she claims she simply cannot shed the pounds. 

She says a gastric band operation would allow her to 'live a normal life', as her obesity has meant she has missed out on being a teenager. 

Battle: Brooke Walker, 15, gained weight after eating a diet of junk food as a child and now weighs 17st. She is desperate for a gastric band operation which she claims would allow her to 'live a normal life'

Appearing on ITV's This Morning, she said: 'I spent all my childhood and teenage years being fat - and it's probably going to go on into my twenties. 

'My size is stopping me from living a normal life.

'People care about your appearance. You walk into a room, they look at you and they judge you. 

'They don't want to get to know you for your personality.'

Brooke's story comes after a U.S. report out today argued obesity should be regarded as a chronic disease with biological causes, that can't be cured through diet and exercise.

Previously, experts have argued that weight loss surgery should be offered to more people as it would save the NHS money in the long term, at a time when obesity-related costs are spiralling.

Brooke said she began gaining weight at seven years old, when she didn't understand concepts like calories and healthy eating.

She said: 'When I was younger I would eat chips, pizza, fast food stuff. Curry cheesy chips, I would have them a lot.

'I wasn't going out and burning off the food I ate. Calorie intake wasn't explained to me. I was seven, I was a child.

'Now, it's completely different. I have breakfast lunch and dinner - and small portions.

'Now I would have cereal for breakfast, lunch, a soup or sandwich - it depends each day.'

Brooke has since moved in with her grandmother, who encouraged healthy eating, exercise and smaller portion sizes.

After this change in lifestyle she was losing weight and enjoyed the feeling, so started skipping entire meals to see a quicker result.

She said: 'I noticed the weight coming off me. I started lose more weight when I missed meals.

'I stopped eating breakfast. I stopped eating lunch at school because I didn't like eating in front of people. I was worried about what people were saying.'

Brooke says she was bullied at school, and told presenters Phillip Schofield and Christine Bleakley she had 'no social life'.

Her grandmother, Pat, said the bullying affects the whole family.

She said: 'It does put a big impact on the family life when Brooke is being bullied, because obviously Brooke takes it out on the ones closest to her.

'So Brooke could be fine, very happy, then she gets a remark off social media, and the whole house could be flipped upside down because Brooke is upset, go off to her room, be withdrawn.

'She finds it hard to talk about what's being said.'

After years of embarrassment, gastric band operation would allow her to live normally and enjoy her twenties.

She said: 'If I get a gastric band, it's not a quick fix.

'It'll be beneficial in the long run, because the weight is coming off you so you can watch what you're eating.

'Also, soon I'll start to like the way I look and I'll feel confident enough so I'll start feel comfortable going out in public by myself and make friends.'

Brooke's story comes after scientists today argued in a new report that exercise and diet are not enough to lose weight when people are obese.

The mantra 'eat less and move more' might help obese people shed pounds in the short term, but most put the weight straight back on, they warn.

Doctors need to regard obesity as a chronic disease with largely biological causes that cannot be cured through diet and exercise alone, the US specialists added.

Dieting triggers several biological systems that drive us to eat high-calorie foods and gain weight – a hangover from when humans needed to store fat to survive in times of scarcity.

And according to the four experts, writing in The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology journal, these biological reasons are why obese people often fail to maintain long-term weight loss.

Lead author Dr Christopher Ochner, from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, said lifestyle changes do not appear capable of overriding this fat-loss defence in most patients.

‘Although lifestyle modifications may result in lasting weight loss in overweight individuals, in those with chronic obesity bodyweight seems to become biologically defended,’ he said.

‘Therefore, the current advice to eat less and exercise more may be no more effective for most obese individuals than a recommendation to avoid sharp objects for someone bleeding profusely.’

Tam Fry, chair of the National Obesity Forum, broadly agreed with the report's findings.

He told This Morning: 'He's been too blunt to say you shouldn't eat well and exercise. 

'Even for those people who have the fat gene, they still need to watch what they're eating and start exercising.

'He is correct that you get to such a size that perhaps that's not the whole story so they need to go off on to something else.'

He said he agreed Brooke should be given the gastric band operation on the NHS, saying it could be 'the game changer' for her.

Option: Some experts, such as Dr Christian Jessen, say more people should be given NHS gastric band surgery  because 'it makes economic sense'

He said: 'The operation should be the last resort. You should go through the healthy lifestyle steps first. But for people like Brooke, who have been through that, it's got to be the operation by choice.

'The NICE guidelines are too stringent. They demand you should be a certain size, and particularly for children. We should be thinking carefully about what we offer children.'

He added that after having the surgery, Brooke would have to stick to a diet and exercise plan, and should be offered psychiatric help to guide her through the drastic change in eating habits.

His comments echo those of other experts, who argue more people should be given gastric band surgery on the NHS because 'it makes economic sense'.

Dr Christian Jessen, presenter of Channel 4's Weighing Up The Enemy, estimates treating obesity and the associated health problems costs the NHS around £6 billion every year.

Experts appearing on the programme argued offering gastric band surgery to more patients could save the health service money.

The cost of the initial bariatric surgery would be recouped by the savings in medications, carers, and the cost of treating obesity-related conditions, they said.

The NHS Choices website reveals gastric band operations cost between £5,000 and £8,000 at private clinics.

And gastric bypass surgery costs the NHS between £9,500 to £15,000.

Last year 8,000 overweight patients were given weight loss surgery on the NHS.

But that is less than one per cent of those people who could benefit, they said.

However, they warned bariatric surgery is not without risks.

Complications include internal bleeding, respiratory problems and post-operative infections.
