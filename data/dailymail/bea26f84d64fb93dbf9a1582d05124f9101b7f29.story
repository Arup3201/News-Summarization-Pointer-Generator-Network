If you have tried and failed to play everything from the violin to the drums and your attic is a graveyard of neglected instruments, a new gadget may be for you.

‘Instrument 1’ claims to be one electronic device that lets you ‘be the whole band’ because it can be used as a variety of instruments, including a guitar, violin, bass, piano and drum machine.

The gadget which slightly resembles a guitar’s fret board, connects to a smartphone, tablet or computer, to allow a user to play any instrument, style and sound on it.

‘Instrument 1’ (pictured centre) claims to be one electronic device that lets you ‘be the whole band’ because it can be used as a variety of instruments, including a guitar, violin, bass, piano and drum machine

It can be used with hundreds of musical apps, such as GarageBand because it recognises universal gestures, such as strumming, tapping, bowing and sliding, for example.

Because if its just rectangular in shape, the instrument, which measures  23.5 inches (60cm) long, can be played in a number of ways.

For example, it can be held under the chin like a violin or laid flat on a table like a piano.

Artiphon, the Nashville Tennessee-based team behind Instrument 1, say the device is designed for musicians and complete amateurs, because it is intuitive to use.

‘We believe anyone can make music, and that most people really want to,’ the start-up wrote on its Kickstarter page.

‘We’re building an instrument that empowers people to play music apps beyond the touchscreen, and we want to inspire people to explore music-making in their everyday lives.’

The company is creating an app to people can customise Instrument 1.

They will be able to make new instrument presets and play them straight away, or use a bow on a banjo and pluck a drum.

There are plans to create a version for the Apple Watch and allow an iPhone to be used as a bow, for example.

The app is being developed for Apple devices.

It has digital strings that stand in for a guitar’s, for example, or separate notes and areas so it can be played like a piano, where frets become keys.

The sound of notes can be changed by using guitar techniques on the fingerboard or by strumming on the bridge, as well as pressing hard and softly.

‘If you’re a drummer or a DJ, transform a whole fret into a pressure-sensing pad like a drum machine,’ the firm said.

‘And if you want to play a violin or pedal steel, slide your fingers along the strings to create sweeping fretless melodies.’

The device enables musicians to re-tune it instantly and turn frets on and off, allowing people to slide between notes seamlessly and use vibrato to make the sound ‘quiver’ - a technique used by professional violinists.

Because the machine is a simply retangular shape and can be used as any instrument, users can play the instrument in different ways.

People can hold it under their chins like a violin, or place it on a table like a keyboard, for example.

'If you want to play like a guitar, you can chord and strum in familiar ways,' the start-up's Kickstarter page says.

'In a piano preset, put it on your lap and the frets become “keys” like a piano (with up to six stacked octaves at your fingertips!).

'If you’re a drummer or a DJ, transform a whole fret into a pressure-sensing pad like a drum machine.

'And if you want to play a violin or pedal steel, slide your fingers along the strings to create sweeping fretless melodies.'

They can even assign different instrument sounds to different strings, to play several instruments at once.

The firm is working on an app that lets people use an iPhone like a bow as well as an app for the Apple Watch.

‘We’ve designed the Instrument 1 to adapt to the way you want to play, and it scales in complexity based on your style and skills.’

The company’s aim is to create a customisable and ‘effortless’ instrument that can be used by anyone.

‘Tune it all to E-major if you like, adjust the sensitivity, or forget strumming altogether and let it auto-play the notes you press,’ it said.

‘The Instrument 1 grows with you as you explore new styles of playing.

‘You can increase complexity as you go, allowing for greater control over every aspect of your performance with its feather-touch playing surface. It's always in tune, and you'll never break a string!’

The instrument is Midi-compatible – the standard used by most digital music programmes - and works with hundreds of apps (an example is shown) and software such as ProTools and Logic

To go off piste, the instrument can be plugged into a tablet or computer so it can make any sound imaginable, such as synthesiser noises.

It can also be connected to iPhones, iPads, Macs and PCs via Lightning connector or USB.

Users can  keep things simple by hearing their musical creation using Instrument 1’s built-in speakers.

‘It's loud enough to play and sing along with friends, and …of course, there’s a headphone output if you want to keep it quiet until you drop the album,’ the company said.

Instrument 1 is available to pre-order via Kickstarter from $349 (£228) in black white. A 'Nashville edition with a would  back is available for $899 (£586)

With 39 days of crowd funding left, the company has already raised over twice as much cash as its $75,000 (£48,897) goal.
