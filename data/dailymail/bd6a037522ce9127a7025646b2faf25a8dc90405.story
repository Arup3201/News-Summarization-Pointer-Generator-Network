Australian golfing legend Greg Norman has revealed how he came close to losing his left hand in a chainsaw accident.

The 59-year-old former world No 1 posted an Instagram picture on Sunday morning of himself lying in a hospital bed with his left arm heavily strapped.

Norman issued a warning next to the picture that read: 'Working with a chainsaw ALWAYS be respectful of the unexpected. I was one lucky man today. Damaged, but not down & out. Still have left hand.'

He wrote: 'Thank u all for your concern & good wishes. All well the morning after the accident. Here I am at the scene of the crime w/my new fashion statement.'

'The Shark' had posted a picture last week holding a chainsaw as he cut back a tree at his beachside property in Florida.

The caption alongside it read: 'Time to trim the sea grapes today. Never ask someone to do something that you can do yourself. Love to work!'

Norman won 90 professional tournaments during a sparkling career, including two Open Championships, and was ranked world No 1 for 331 weeks during the eighties and nineties.
