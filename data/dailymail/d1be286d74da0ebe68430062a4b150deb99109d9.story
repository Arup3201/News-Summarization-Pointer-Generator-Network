Ed Miliband was dealt a twin blow last night after two former allies launched devastating attacks on his leadership skills.

Lord Glasman, the political ‘guru’ who was rewarded by Mr Miliband with a Labour peerage, said it was time he showed he was sufficiently ‘grown-up’ to become Prime Minister.

And rebel MP Tom Watson, who quit over the Labour seat-rigging scandal in Falkirk, said Mr Miliband was wrong to have called in police, and had caved in to pressure from David Cameron over the issue.

Significantly, both men questioned Mr Miliband’s leadership qualities and said he must admit to economic blunders made by Gordon Brown’s Government, in which he was a senior Cabinet Minister.

Writing in today’s Mail on Sunday, Lord Glasman said the Labour leader had failed to produce the policies needed to get Britain’s economy back on track.

‘At the very time when Labour should be showing the way ahead, it gives the impression of not knowing which way  to turn.

‘When the Labour battle  bus should be revving up, it is parked in a lay-by of introspection. It is time for Ed Miliband to show he is a grown-up politician big enough to lead this country,’ he added.

The peer’s comments came after 
mounting criticism of Mr Miliband from Labour ranks. The party leader’s 
bad run culminated with him being pelted with eggs during a walkabout in
London last week – his first public appearance since returning from 
holiday.

Academic Lord Glasman, 52, became a ‘guru’ after inventing the ‘Blue Labour’ movement, aimed at winning back working-class support.

He said Mr Miliband had ‘great’ ideas on ‘regional banks, vocational colleges, the Living Wage, an interest rate cap and worker representation’.

But he warned: ‘All of this will count for nothing unless there is clarity on what went wrong under the last Labour Government and what we now need to do to make things better.’

In another dig, Mr Watson said: ‘Ed’s got to get his message across .  .  . and show more of his leadership qualities.’
