With a dash of Grand Marnier, a soupçon of Chartreuse, a hefty dose of cognac and a dash of Angostura Bitters, the new 'Winston' cocktail at Melbourne's Club 23 sounds like a delicious treat for liqueur fans.

But there's a catch that might just make patrons choke on their drink: the 'Winston' costs a staggering £8,167.

As a result, the expensive tipple has now been crowned the world's most expensive cocktail, pushing London's 'Salvatore's Legacy' into second place.

Expensive taste: Club 23 bartender Joel Heffernan puts the finishing touches to a 'Winston' cocktail

The hefty price tag is thanks to the ultra-luxe ingredients, which include Grand Marnier Quintessence and Chartreuse Vieillissement Exceptionnellement Prolonge.

Most expensive of the lot is the 1858 Croizet cognac, which costs £99,000 a bottle.

The cocktail is served with garnishes that include chocolate nutmeg dust, poppy seed essence, rose essence and a little coconut.

Along with deep pockets, those who wish to sample the cocktail will need to place their orders well before they arrive, as the drink takes two days to make, thanks to the labour intensive garnish.

The cocktail it replaced at the top of the most expensive list is the 'Salvatore's Legacy' made and sold at the Playboy Club in London's Mayfair for £5,500.

Created by longtime mixologist, Salvatore Calabrese, the drink is based on alcohol that pre-dates both American Independence and the French Revolution.

Among them are a 1778 Clos de Griffier Vieux Cognac, a 1770 Kummel Liqueur, an 1860 Dubb Orange Curacao and two dashes of Angostura Bitters dating from around 1900.

Drink up! Will it be a 'Winston' for owner Shane Warne or regular, singer Delta Goodrem?

While Club 23's offering might not have quite the pedigree of the Playboy Club's cocktail, it has certainly made headlines - something the club's owner, former cricketer Shane Warne knows all about.

The club opened less than two years ago in November 2011, and Warne, never one to miss out on a party, threw a lavish, star-studded bash to celebrate.

Since then, A-listers, including Tiger Woods, Delta Goodrem and former Spice Girl, Mel B, have flocked through the doors to enjoy the plush surroundings.

Whether or not they'll splash out on the £8,000 'Winston' remains to be seen.
