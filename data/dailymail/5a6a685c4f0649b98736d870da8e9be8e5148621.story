Jay Leno's run as the host of the Tonight Show is drawing to a close, and after routinely denying requests for him to be a guest, House Speaker John Boehner agreed Thursday to have a seat on Leno's couch to talk about a variety of issues ranging from infighting in the Republican Party to the tangerine hue of the speaker's skin. 

As for the tan, Boehner says it's au naturel.

'Listen, I play golf, I ride a bike, I cut my own grass, my mother is 
dark complected, so I’m a little dark,' Boehner told Leno. 'There’s no 
tanning beds, no spray anything, never, not once ever, ever, nothing.'

The speaker went on to discuss his pick for the 2016 presidential election - and was sure to make it clear that he was not interested in the job.

'I do drink red wine. I smoke cigarettes. And I'm not giving that up to be the president of the United States,' Boehner joked.

Boehner went on to say that he is yet to endorse anyone for the 2016 race, but he's got someone in mind.

'I’m not endorsing anybody, but Jeb Bush is my friend, and I frankly think he’d make a great president,' Boehner said.

The speaker touched on former NSA analyst Edward Snowden's leaking of classified information - according to Boehner, Snowden is a 'traitor.'

'We spy on everyone else, and they all spy on us, so let’s just get over
 it, it’s been going on for thousands of years,' he said.

At one point, Leno asked the speaker if he felt the general public blames Republicans for the 16-day government shut down last year. Boehner's answer: 'yup.'

'Listen, I told my colleagues in July I didn’t think shutting down the government over Obamacare would work because the President said "I’m not going to negotiate,’” Boehner said. 'I said, "If you want to fight this fight, I’ll fight the fight with you," but it was a very predictable disaster, and so the sooner we got it over with the better.'

Buds: Boehner says he and President Obama don't agree on much, but says they have a good relationship

Boehner explained that while he and President Obama don't tend to agree on much, the two have a good relationship.

One specific area where Boehner disagrees with the president is how he engages with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who the speaker describes as 'a thug.'

'I think he's treated his neighbors in a disrespectful way and frankly, I
 think the president ought to stand up to him and better protect 
America's interests and our allies, especially in Eastern Europe,' he told Leno.

Leno's final Tonight Show is scheduled for February 6.
