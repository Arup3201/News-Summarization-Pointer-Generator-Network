The duo are regarded as the two best players in the world, after repeatedly having mesmeric seasons at Spanish eternal rivals Real Madrid and Barcelona.

Laudrup, who starred for both Barcelona and Real during his glittering career, strongly thinks the duo will go two of the finest players ever to grace they game when they retire.

'I think they need each other,' he told EFE. 'If one scores a hat-trick, the other tries to beat that. 

'They are two of the best, not just of this era - in 30 years we'll be talking about them and the debate will be whether Messi, Cristiano, Maradona or Pele is the greatest of all time.' he added.

When asked which of them he would rather have in his team, the Dane replied: 'Both would have to be in it, as they've clearly been the best two over the past four or five years.'

Ronaldo and Messi will have their first El Clasico clash of the season when Real entertain Barcelona in La Liga on October 25.
