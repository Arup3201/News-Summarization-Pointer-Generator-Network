John O'Shea has said there will be no love lost when he comes face to face with former Sunderland team-mate Jack Colback.

The Black Cats skipper revealed he will be avoiding any pleasantries with Colback as the 25-year-old prepares to make his first appearance for Newcastle against his old club.

It is just 10 months since Sunderland academy product Colback scored for the Wearside club in the same fixture last season, a fact O'Shea remembers well.

'Whatever happens afterwards – shaking hands – there'll be none of that beforehand. 

'(Colback)'s been one of their best performers this season and we know what he's capable of.

'He did it to Newcastle last season.'

Colback refused to extend his contract at the Stadium of Light last summer, choosing to move over to Tyneside to play with arch rivals Newcastle. 

He has been in great form for the Magpies this season and O'Shea is aware of the danger he poses.

'I'm sure whoever is playing in midfield, Jack will be looking to get right into them and likewise for us as well.'

Having featured in various hich-octane Manchester derbies during his spell at former club Manchester United, Republic of Ireland international O'Shea will not be letting the occasion get the best of him.

The Tyne-Wear derby will be particularly intense as Colback looks to win three points against his former club 

'When you've been successful in these games, that's an important psychological thing,' said the centre-half.

'But you can talk about these things, you have to go out and do them on Sunday afternoon when there's going to be lots of people in the stadium willing you to have a bad game.

'I'm sure the Newcastle lads will be reminded of the recent games, so there's motivation on both sides.'

Sunderland boast 3-0 victories in their last two visits to Newcastle, as the Black Cats look to extend their five-game unbeaten run against Alan Pardew's men following their Capital One Cup defeat to Tottenham on Wednesday.

'Newcastle won't have been too happy with the result in midweek. But they've been on a fantastic run of form so we're under no illusions that it's going to be tough.

'We've been very solid though and close to winning lots of matches.

'We just need a bit of a killer instinct all round the pitch to make sure we come away with three points instead of a draw.' 

Colback spent 14 years on the books at Sunderland and made his first team debut in 2009

Colback made 135 appearances for the Black Cats scoring five goals, including against Newcastle last season

'It's just a fantastic game to be involved in,' he added.

'I used to watch the games on the telly, but then you don't realise until you come and play in them that they're up there with some of the biggest in world football because of the intensity and atmosphere.

'It's why you're a footballer to play in games like this.

'I've had some fantastic moments in derbies and some not so nice ones, particularly so in Manchester.

'But up here, they've gone quite well so far and hopefully that continues.'
