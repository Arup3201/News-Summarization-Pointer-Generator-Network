Lauren Kavanaugh, from Texas, lived in a 4ft x 9ft closet from three to eight years old, only brought out to be tortured. She was rescued by police in 2001 and adopted but struggled to adapt to a normal life. Since then, she has graduated high school and is now studying psychology with the aim of qualifying as a counsellor. 

A woman whose mother and stepfather tortured her, forced her to live in a wardrobe for five years and allegedly raped her nightly has spoken of her joy at finally being able to move on with her life.  

Lauren Kavanaugh, now 21 and living in Athens, Texas, lived in a 4ft by 9ft closet from the ages of three until eight, held there by her mother Barbara Atkinson and stepfather Kenny Atkinson. 

The evil couple called Lauren their 'little secret' – only bringing her out to torture and allegedly her – but were caught when they showed her off to a horrified neighbour who alerted police.

When Lauren was pulled from the tiny cupboard at her mother's home in Dallas, Texas, in 2001, she was eight but weighed 25.6 pounds (1st 8lbs), the same as the average two-year-old and was potbellied with malnutrition.

She was rushed to surgery where she was fitted with a colostomy bag, but her organs were shutting down. 

During her stay in hospital, doctors had to use a feeding method devised for Holocaust victims because her body was so starved. 

Investigators said she also suffered years of sexual abuse - leaving her tiny body so badly damaged that she needed a series of reconstructive surgeries - but because it would be too traumatic for the then-eight-year-old to testify, Barbara and Kenny Atkinson were never convicted of rape. 

Fortunately, she recovered from the traumatic time and now she is a student who supports other victims of abuse.

Barbara and Kenny were convicted of felony injury to a child in 2002 and jailed for life, not eligible for parole until 2031.

When Lauren was pulled from the tiny cupboard at her mother's home in Dallas, Texas, in 2001, she was eight but weighed 25.6 pounds (1st 8lbs), the same as the average two-year-old and was potbellied with malnutrition

Lauren's mother Barbara Atkinson and stepfather Kenny Atkinson were convicted of felony injury to a child in 2002 and jailed for life, not eligible for parole until 2031.

Recounting her ordeal, Lauren said: 'One day mum was so sick of me sobbing that she grabbed my arm and told me, 'get into the closet.'

'I was huddled in there for hours under a rail of dresses and shirts. I thought it was a punishment.

'There was no water or food, just darkness.'

Sometime later, she recalled being pulled out and raped. She was only three.

She continued: 'They put country music on blaring to hide my screams.

'After hours of abuse, I was bundled back into the closet, confused and in agony.

'From then on, it became my new home.

'I couldn't do anything in the darkness. I slept in there and had to use it for the bathroom.

'The carpet was drenched in urine and I lay under a thin, wet blanket.' 

Lauren was forced to live in a 4ft x 9ft closet for five years. She also had to use the space as her bathroom

Lauren was also tortured and burnt with cigarettes. 

She said: 'I was weak from hunger and was tied down so I couldn't fight back.

'I had to eat anything I could find in the closet and I was only let out for torture.

'One day, mum ran me a bath and pushed my head under water.

'Another time when I was six, mum put a bowl of macaroni cheese in front of me - she told me I could chew it but then had to spit it out.'

Although Lauren was constantly abused, her brothers and sisters were left alone. 

She admitted: 'Sometimes I could hear them laughing and playing outside.' 

Lauren had initially been given up for adoption by Barbara as a child and was taken in by a couple called Sabrina and Bill Kavanaugh, but eight months later, the Kavanaughs received a call that Barbara had changed her mind and wanted the little girl back.

The couple fought to keep the child, but during the adoption process, their lawyer had mistakenly never filed the paperwork to terminate Barbara's parental rights.

The mistake meant the Kavanaughs lost the custody battle on a technicality, and had to send the little girl back to her mother when she was two years old.

Over the next six years, Lauren was subjected to horrific abuse by her mother and stepfather until she was finally rescued. 

After being found by the police in 2001,  Lauren was re-adopted by Sabrina and Bill. 

But despite finding a loving family to take care of her, her early trauma had a lasting impact and she would hide food for later, worried it would vanish.

She also did not know how to play with toys, had the mental age of someone much younger and would try and sleep in her wardrobe every night.

She said: 'The first time I saw grass I was eight and I thought it was biting my feet and when I had baths I would yell, "don't drown me."'

She has regularly endured fits of rage, fights at school, self-harming suicide attempts, and seizures when her body sought to block out the painful memories, particularly of the rapes.

But she said a fight at school was a turning point because she was put in an alternative school and residential therapy, where she met other abuse survivors and learned she was not alone.

Gradually, Lauren learnt to live again and even managed to pass the high school exams to get into Trinity Valley Community College in Athens, where she now studies pyschology. 

She is also no longer taking any medication for depression or bipolar disorder. 

She said: 'I've started studying psychology at college and I plan to go to university next year.

'I've even moved into my own flat.

'My dream now is to qualify as a counsellor - I really want to help victims like me to overcome their abuse and be strong.

'I've been in their shoes and come out the other side.'

She is also no longer taking any medication for depression or bipolar disorder. She is also studying psychology at college with the aim of becoming a counsellor and hopes her story can help other victims of abuse
