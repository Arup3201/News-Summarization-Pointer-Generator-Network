As the search intensifies for a retired firefighter who vanished from an Amtrak train and left his belongings, officials say he may have fallen off somewhere between Colorado and Nebraska.

Charlie Dowd, 69, boarded a train from 
his native San Mateo, California, home on Wednesday morning to visit his
son and grandchildren in Montreal, Canada.

He was supposed to transfer in Chicago but when the train got there on Friday afternoon, Mr Dowd was not on it, but his luggage, cellphone and medication were.

Missing: Charles Dowd, 69, was on his way to Montreal from California via Amtrak when he vanished somewhere between Denver and Chicago

His son talked to him on Thursday evening when the train was in the Denver area - the last time he heard from Mr Dowd.

But concern is growing for the missing man as Amtrak said this week that he may have become disoriented during the trip, opened a door while the train was moving, and fell out.

Amtrak officials told KMTV that passengers discovered an exterior door was ajar at about 11pm on Thursday night and reported it to train workers the following morning.

Another passenger reportedly said that they saw Mr Dowd by the door at about 10pm on Thursday night.

That timeline puts the train between 
Fort Collins, Colorado, and McCook, Nebraska, at the time of Mr Dowd's 
disappearance - cities that are about 160 miles apart.

His family traveled to Omaha, Nebraska, on Monday to begin a search and hand out flyers with Mr Dowd's picture.

His daughter Jennifer Dowd told the San Francisco Chronicle: 'This is not in my dad's character at all. This is a big mystery. We're very worried about him.'

Family members said that they are worried that Dowd may become disoriented without his medication.

Jennifer Dowd told the Chronicle: 'He just got approval from his doctor to take this trip. We never, ever would have let him travel cross-country if we thought he was in any danger.'

The family told ABC affiliate KGO that Mr Dowd also takes medication for high blood pressure, heart disease and diabetes.

Cops are also investigating a tip that Mr Dowd became confused during the train ride, and told an Amtrak employee that he didnâ€™t believe he was on a train.

He is believed to have told a conductor at one point that he thought he was in an apartment and needed to find the front door.

Dowd is 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs about 175 pounds.
