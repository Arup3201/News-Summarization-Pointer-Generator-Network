The biggest test in international football is to play in front of 90,000 spectators in a World Cup semi-final against Germany or Argentina.

In the absence of anything like that coming any time soon for England’s players, an entirely different proposition is a a Euro 2016 qualifier against the world’s worst international football team.

Against opposition as pitiful as San Marino, it is about professionalism

For three days, since England’s players met at St George’s Park on Monday evening, they have been psyching themselves up to play a team that could barely string two passes together. Wembley is no place for San Marino.

This was a night to get the job done, to show focus before England travel to Tallinn on Sunday for a slightly trickier clash in Group E against Estonia.

In many ways England’s players, who toyed with their opponents throughout, should be congratulated for taking a game like this as seriously as they did.

Here, in front of just over 50,000 die-hard England fans at the national stadium, they simply wore down their opponents until they surrendered. It took only 23 minutes.

In years to come, it is to be hoped that the FA follow through with their proposal to take matches like this around the country again.When Phil Jagielka scored England’s opening goal, there was a polite ripple of applause from the fans in the stands. It was like being at the tennis.

San Marino were painful to watch. They boast a right back in Mirko Palazzi who, unfathomably, just threw the ball over Joe Hart’s goal-line from a throw-in. 

What a night it was for the Vitaiolis, too: at half time neither Fabio nor Matteo had managed to get into double figures in terms of touches. They got there in the end, just after the start of the second half.

In the dug-out Hodgson broke into sporadic fits of laughter as he waited, patiently, for England to score again. He will learn nothing about the ability of his players on the ball when England are playing opposition that would struggle to beat the best eleven pub players from your village.

Instead it is part of a learning process for these players, accepting that internationals can throw up some ridiculous matches.

So the likes of Calum Chambers, Raheem Sterling, Kieran Gibbs and others can continue their international education against sub-standard opposition. San Marino fit the bill.

There was not a hint of arrogance about them, from the moment England sang the national anthem with their now traditional gusto to the embraces at the final whistle. These are cheap caps against scarcely credible opposition, but the younger gang in the England squad are learning what it means to play at Wembley Stadium for the national team.

They know that the minimum acceptable number of goals against the 208th-best team in the world is four or five on home soil 

It creates a different environment and that can only be a good thing for a team that must grow together before they set foot in France for the finals in 2016.

Other than that, what is the head coach supposed to glean from a game like this?

Manager Roy Hodgson could afford a smile as England enjoyed a comfortable victory

For some reason he gave a little fist pump when Wayne Rooney scored his 42nd goal in an England shirt from the penalty spot just before half time. Captain and coach have a flourishing relationship.

He will be pleased with the contribution of others, especially James Milner after he was stationed in a deep-lying central midfield position in the first half.

It was a decent performance from the Manchester City midfielder, but no-one involved with the national team will get carried away after this.

Good on Danny Welbeck for adding England’s third after the break, but there are far bigger tests to come for Hodgson’s squad. Scotland, Italy and the Republic of Ireland all feature in the international calendar before the end of the season.

Let’s be honest, those games cannot come quickly enough.
