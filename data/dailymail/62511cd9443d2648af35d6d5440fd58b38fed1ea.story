Arguments stem from the fact that both sides believe they are in the right.

But while most people would claim the best way to win one is to try and convince the other party to agree with their views, a new study suggests otherwise.

Researchers in Israel discovered that by agreeing with the other person, through extreme examples of their views, can make them reconsider how they feel.

To test their theory, the researchers, including graduate students of Professor Eran Halperin, from the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya in Israel, asked 150 Israeli participants to watch videos. Half were shown clips relating to the Israel and Palestine conflict (Gaza pictured) while the other half were shown neutral adverts

Half were shown clips relating to the Israel and Palestine conflict, while the other half were shown neutral TV commercials as a control.

The clips demonstrated how the conflict was consistent with many participants' beliefs, but these views were portrayed at the very extreme

‘For example, the fact that they are the most moral society in the world is one of the most basic beliefs of Israeli society,’ Professor Halperin said.

But the video clips claimed Israel should continue to take part in the conflict so that its citizens could continue to feel moral. 

When questioned about their views on the conflict, following months of similar tests, the researchers reported a 30 per cent increase in their willingness to re-evaluate their position compared to the control group. 

Half were shown clips relating to the Israel and Palestine conflict, while the other half were shown neutral TV commercials as a control.

Instead of highlighting how the clips were at odds with Israeli values, the videos instead demonstrated how the conflict was consistent with many participants' beliefs.

However, these views were portrayed at the very extreme

‘For example, the fact that they [believe they are one of] the most moral societies in the world is one of the most basic beliefs of Israeli society,’ Professor Halperin said.

But the video clips claimed Israel should continue to take part in the conflict so that its citizens could continue to feel moral. This caused anger among the group.

When questioned about their views on the conflict, following months of similar tests, the researchers reported a 30 per cent increase in their willingness to re-evaluate their position compared to the control group.

They also took a more neutral stance on common political ideals, and this shift continued even a year after the study had ended.

Arguing with a partner isn't just upsetting - it's also bad for your heart.

People who think their partner is unsupportive are more likely to develop heart disease, a study has found.

Scientists at the University of Utah found people who claim their spouse is sometimes supportive, but also sometimes upsetting have higher levels of artery calcification.

This suggests their arteries are diseased and they are at greater risk of premature death. 

The scientists attribute this to the fact that the new information caused people to see their views as irrational, according to the study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

‘We truly believe that in most intractable conflicts, the real problems are not the real issues,’ said Professor Halperin.

In reality, he continued, both sides know what needs to be done but there are many ‘psychological barriers that prevent societies from identifying opportunities for peace.’

‘You take people's most basic beliefs and turn them into something that is absurd,’ Professor Halperin said.

‘For an outsider, it can sound like a joke, but for them, you are playing with their most fundamental belief.’

The scientists said the method needs to be tested further.

They also questioned how to get people to watch videos they find uncomfortable outside of the experiment setting.

Students Boaz Hameiri and Roni Porat, who helped run the study, additionally expressed concern at the possibility the videos may assimilate the extreme views into the participant’s beliefs.
