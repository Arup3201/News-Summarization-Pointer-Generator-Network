A group of alleged thugs are behind bars after they attempted to have sex with two underage girls, record it on video and then put evidence of the alleged crime on the Internet, where one of the girls' teachers at an Oregon junior high school saw it and reported it to authorities.

The video of the two girls - one of whom was a 12-year-old seventh-grader at Centennial Middle School in Portland - found its way to the Facebook pages of students at another middle school within the same district, where a social media-savvy teacher spotted it on one of his student's Facebook pages, recognized one of the girls as an underage student and told the school's principal.

It didn't take long for authorities to identify the adult men in the video, one of whom is a known gang member with the 'Unthank Park Hustlers.'

The video was allegedly filmed on May 19.

'It's extremely outrageous," Portland police Captain Kevin Modica, who oversees the Multnomah County Child Abuse Team, told the Oregonian. "A horrible crime was committed against vulnerable teenagers. I feel very disgusted that this happened in our community. The victims may never recover from this.'

What's equally outrageous, according to criminology professor and co-director of Northeastern University's Brudnick Center on Violence and Conflict Jack Levin, is that the suspects had the audacity to post evidence of the alleged crime on the Internet.

'Many criminal acts are committed on the Internet simply because of the 
illusion that it gives of anonymity. It's a fallacy, and completely 
delusional. But so are they,' Levin says. 'The distinction between 
public and private has been lost, thanks to the Internet.'

The suspects have been identified as known gangster Cedrell Lyonell Washington, 20, Deshawn Ceville Rogers, 22, Nicholas Kelly Clisby, 23, and Terry Lamar Scott, 18, each of whom now face multiple felony charges ranging from rape to endangering the welfare of a minor.

The 12-year-old victim has been advised to not return to school for the rest of the year because many of the other students had seen the video and were talking about it.

However, school principal Doug Cook told the paper that administrators have remained in contact with both the girl and her mother 'to allow her to share any concerns with us.'

Cook says the school would welcome the victim back to finish her classes, if that's what she wants to do.
