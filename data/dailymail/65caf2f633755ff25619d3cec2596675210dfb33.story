Alan Greaves died after being attacked on his way to a Christmas Eve midnight mass

Police investigating the murder of a church organist who died after he was attacked on Christmas Eve have arrested a man.

Lay preacher Alan Greaves was making his way to midnight mass at St Saviour's Church, near his home in High Green, Sheffield, when he was subjected to the attack.

A 21-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of Mr Greaves's murder, South Yorkshire Police said.

Mr Greaves, who died after he was 
attacked on the way to play at Midnight Mass, was attacked with a  weapon
and discovered by a pizza-delivery boy.

He was taken to hospital where he underwent four hours of emergency surgery for multiple head injuries. He died two days later.

Police said the arrest came after an excellent public response to an appeal made by detectives yesterday.

At a press conference, Detective Superintendent Matt Fenwick said police had not established a motive for Mr Greaves's murder.

Police also released CCTV footage of two men filmed just before the 68-year-old grandfather was attacked as he went to the church a few hundred yards away from his home on December 24.

Mr Greaves died from severe head injuries three days later. More than 50 police officers have been working on the case.

A South Yorkshire Police spokesman said tonight: 'Following yesterday's media appeal by Senior Investigating Officer Detective Superintendent Matt Fenwick, and an excellent public response, a 21-year-old man from the High Green area of Sheffield has been arrested on suspicion of the murder of Alan Greaves.

'Inquiries are continuing and the investigation team wish to reiterate their appeal to the community of Sheffield to continue to come forward with information.

'Anyone with information should contact the incident room on 01709 443723.'

Two men were arrested last month in connection with Mr Greaves's murder and bailed pending further inquiries.

Last week, independent charity Crimestoppers put up a £10,000 reward to help find those responsible for Mr Greaves's death.

The reward will be available to anyone providing information to Crimestoppers leading to the arrest and conviction of any person or persons responsible for Mr Greaves's death.

Detective Superintendent Matt Fenwick
said at an earlier press conference: 'Alan Greaves was a church organist 
with a strong religious faith and was on his way to church when he was 
assaulted.

He was a loving caring husband, father and grandfather who 
was well loved and respected by all who knew him.'

At a service after her husband's death, Mr Greaves's widow Maureen said she had wept over the 'evil that has been done'.

She told the congregation of St Saviour's she had felt their love and support since her husband died.

The
Bishop of Sheffield, who attended the service, paid tribute to the 
devout Anglican and lay preacher, saying the church had lost a ‘shining 
light’.

Thanking the congregation for their 
support, Mrs Greaves said: ‘I have prayed constantly for Alan and I know
you have too. I have not stopped crying for him and I know you have not
stopped either.

‘I have wept over the evil that has been done. I have prayed for you and I know you have prayed for me.

Support: Mrs Greaves, left, was comforted after she attended the church service where she thanked the congregation for their help, which was led by the Bishop of Sheffield Steven Croft, right

‘You were Alan’s Christian family and he loved belonging to this church. I have felt your love towards me.’

Mr Greaves, a former social worker who
leaves behind four children and two grandchildren, had played the organ
and preached at his local church for nine years.

He also played the piano for children 
at a primary school and had set up a food bank and community project for
disadvantaged people with his wife.

After the service, Dr Croft paid tribute to Mrs Greaves, who is an evangelist with the Church Army.

He said: ‘Maureen has been very impressive and courageous throughout this week.

‘I spoke to her on Friday morning and she was courageous then but in deep shock.’

After Mr Greaves died, Mrs Greaves, 63, said she did not seek vengeance.
