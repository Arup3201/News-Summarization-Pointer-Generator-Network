Jesus has been named the most significant person in human history, followed by Napoleon and Shakespeare, as ruled by the internet.

Based on the impact on opinions certain individuals have had over time, and how that has reflected onto their Wikipedia pages, two computer scientists have come up with the ultimate list.

Professor Steven Skiena and Charles Ward use quantative analysis to rank more than a thousand historical figures and prominent people, from Elvis to Beethoven, Stalin and Queen Victoria.

Not Kayne West: The number one most significant person in human history is Christian prophet Jesus

With Jesus as a front runner it comes as no great surprise that the prophet Muhammad is ranked at number four.

Leaders of empires are prominent on the list with Napoleon as number second and Alexander the Great at number nine.

Alexander’s teacher and the founder of Western philosophy, Aristotle, is listed as number eight.

The list sees three US presidents, two of which were the founding fathers of the United States, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.

Runners up: French military and politician leader Napoleon Bonaparte was listed as number two, followed by British literary icon William Shakespeare

American leader: Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the US, and the first of three of the same on the list

However despite their indisputable 
significance in history, they are both outranked by Abraham Lincoln, who
 is listed as number five.

1. Jesus2. Napoleon Bonaparte3. William Shakespeare4. Muhammad5. Abraham Lincoln6. George Washington7. Adolf Hitler8. Aristotle9. Alexander the Great10. Thomas Jefferson

The
 top-ten only lists one Briton, the formidable William Shakespeare, 
author of Romeo and Juliet and responsible for centuries of unreasonable
 expectations of love.

The 
only entry on the list which serves as a person of impact ‘lest we 
forget’ is Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, who is ranked as the seventh most
 significant person in human history.

The
 is an unmissable absence of women on the list, which the authors 
explain is a result of centuries of inequality meaning the impact of 
female figures has not been as great.

In the book Who's Bigger? Where 
Historical Figures Really Rank, Professor Skiena and Mr Ward compare their ranking to
 Google’s system of ranking web pages in a search.

By collection millions of opinions on famous and infamous figures throughout history they have calculated, how successfully the idea of each person has spread in society through time.

Two sides: Founding father of the US, George Washington, came ahead of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler

Big thinker: The brains behind Western philosophy, Aristotle, is listed as number eight

Tailing behind: Bringing up the rear are two other great leaders, Alexander the Great and Thomas Jefferson

‘We would call Jesus "the most significant person ever",’ Professor Skiena told Pacific Standard.

‘With over two billion followers a full 2,000 years after his death, Jesus is an incredibly successful historical meme.’

The
 pair use English Wikipedia as a base for their algorithm, which has led
 to some figures ranking higher than they ‘should,’ Skiena says.

‘Our rankings will continue to evolve with Wikipedia, and people can move up or down over time.

‘The highly ranked fellow most on the bubble is George W. Bush, who our algorithms put too high at 36.

‘This
 is an artifact of his having dominated coverage during eight years of 
Wikipedia's rapid growth. Objectively, he belongs in the main body of 
presidents we rank at around 200 or so.’
