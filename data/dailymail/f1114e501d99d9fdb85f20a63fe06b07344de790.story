New Silverstone chief Patrick Allen is to kickstart his bid to make the British Grand Prix more affordable with immediate effect.

Allen was appointed to his role earlier this month after the British Racing Drivers' Club decided a change of management behind the scenes was required to push the Northamptonshire circuit forward.

Allen quickly stated the cheapest race-day ticket for this season's event on July 5, priced at £155 for general admission, was far too expensive.

Lewis Hamilton won last year's event - where the cheapest race-day ticket was priced at £155

Allen declared his intention to make tickets for next year's race as low as £99, but has been so overwhelmed by positive feedback, he has decided to take the innovative step now.

From 9am Wednesday 1,000 general-admission tickets priced at £99 are to go on sale on a first-come first-served basis, the first time since 2008 tickets have been available for the race at that price.

Allen has also decided children aged 10 and under can attend the whole weekend free of charge on a general-admission ticket, whilst children aged 11-15 can attend race day for only £49.

Hamilton (racing last year for Mercedes) won 11 races on his way to the 2014 Drivers' World Championship

Allen said: 'We need to start appealing to a broader audience, and an element of this is obviously about getting the product right, but we also have to offer good value for money.

'The last time Silverstone sold grand prix tickets for £99 was the same year Lewis Hamilton won his first F1 world championship.

'So in order to celebrate his second title we are releasing a limited number of 2015 tickets at 2008 prices.'
