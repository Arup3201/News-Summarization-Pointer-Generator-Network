A stunned theatre audience watched a real-life drama unfold on stage after an actor hit his co-star in the face with a kettle forcing the performance to be abandoned.

Actress Lizzy Dive, who playing Mrs Twit during a production of Roald Dahl's novel The Twits, had to be taken to the hospital after the mock fight scene went wrong - 10 minutes before the end of the show.

She was accidentally struck in the face by a kettle, hurled by her onstage husband Mr Twit, after he dodged the frying pan she was wielding.

Real-life drama: The characters Mr and Mrs Twit during their performance at the Minack Theatre, Cornwall. On Friday night Mr Twit accidentally hit Mrs Twit in the face with a kettle

The blunder was played out in front of hundreds at the Minack Theatre, in Penzance, Cornwall, who never got to see how the show ended.

One crowed member, who did not want to be named said: 'We very much enjoyed The Twits and despite the weather it was very funny and everything was going to plan.

'But we couldn’t believe what happened in the final closing scenes - it looked incredibly painful and the whole audience, including us, were quite worried about Mrs Twit.

'I hope she is okay now, but it was quite a bad incident. After the show I had to go home and read the rest of the book to know how it ended.'

The slapstick mishap happened during a performance of The Twits by open air theatre company Illyria inside the Minack Theatre on Friday.

Mrs Dive was smashed in the face with the metal kettle during a fighting scene in the last ten minutes of the 8pm performance.

She was taken to nearby West Cornwall Hospital but was later released with bruising to her face.

The remaining part of the show had to be abandoned following the incident.

Minack Theatre manager Phil Jackson, 58, said: 'It was a bit of slapstick. There is a lot of slapstick in The Twits but Mrs Twit didn’t manage to get her head out of the way in time.

'It went a little bit wrong - it’s all done with sound effects.

'It happens a few times in the play, she swings a frying pan at him and he swings a kettle but on this occasion it went wrong.

'It shocked her quite a bit.'

During the play, Mrs Mugglewump, played by Emma Vickery, also received an injury during an acrobatic scene, slipping and hurting her back.

Oliver Gray, 48, artistic director for the play, writing on the theatre group’s Facebook page, said: 'During the show Mr and Mrs Twit spend a lot of time hitting each other with blunt metal instruments - obviously it’s choreographed very carefully.

'On this occasion let’s just say that contact was made.

'The good news is that following a trip to A and E for both Mrs Twit and Mrs Mugglewump, both are fit and well.

'Mrs Twit has sustained nothing more than a bruise and a surprise and Mrs Mugglewump had some swelling on her back that was pressing on the nerve, but by the next morning the swelling had gone down substantially and she is in much better form.

'There was no show scheduled for yesterday so they were both able to get a bit of a rest.

'And at present both are putting up the stage for this afternoon’s performance near Woking.

'Many thanks for your concern, and I hope the accident didn’t spoil your enjoyment of the play too much.'

In an earlier version of this item, we reported that Ms Dive suffered mild concussion.  We are happy to clarify it was only minor bruising.
