World Cup winger Max Gradel is a firm target for Bournemouth as they try to build on an impressive first season back in the Championship.

The former Leeds United man has been in Brazil with Didier Drogba’s Ivory Coast but his future at Saint-Etienne remains up in the air.

Gradel made 23 appearances in Ligue 1 last season but has entered the final year of his contract over in France.

Eddie Howe’s side performed relative miracles in the second tier last season, finishing 10th and with more than a sniff of making the play-offs until the final weeks.

And the Cherries plan on capitalising on that, having already landed the highly-rated Callum Wilson from Coventry City for an undisclosed fee.

Gradel was a fans’ favourite at Dean Court during a loan spell at the club back in 2007 where he scored nine times in League One.

The 26-year-old was one of the better performers for the Ivorians during their eventual group stage elimination.
