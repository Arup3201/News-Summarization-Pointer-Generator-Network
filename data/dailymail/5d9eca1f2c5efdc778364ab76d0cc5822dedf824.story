A dog that risked its life trying to save its owner from a deadly blaze is recovering. 

Carmen, a 9-year-old boxer, was found covering her owner's face as the residential fire burned.

It's still unclear what started the fire at the house in Ohio's Goshen Township.

Owner Ben Ledford died after the fire despite his dog's brave effort

KTLA reports that Ben Ledford, 33, did not survive despite the dog's heroism.

'A lot of dogs instinctively know when there’s a crisis going on and so a lot of them do go try to protect their owners,' said veterinarian Dr. Marlo Anderson.

WCPO reports that Carmen remains in critical condition at the Seven Hills Pet Clinic.

There she rests in an oxygen chamber where vets feed her fluids intravenously.

She can stand but has difficulty breathing on her own.

It will be at least 24 hours before they can determine Carmen's chances of recovery.

At least one person, Ron Mitchell, attempted to get Ledford to safety before firefighters arrived but the fire and smoke were too much for him.

'I tried to climb through the front door. I got about a bodies length in and the smoke was so thick that I had to come back out and then I went around the back of the door in back of the house and saw that the dryer vent that was on the back that window to the basement was on fire,' he said.

Ledford was pronounced dead shortly after arriving at Bethesda North Hospital, though he displayed signs of life when medics first reached him.  

Authorities are focusing their investigation on the basement to find the fire's cause.
