Race row footballer Luis Suarez today apologised for refusing to shake the hand of Patrice Evra before Manchester United's ill-tempered match with Liverpool yesterday.

The Uruguayan striker had come face-to-face with Evra at Old Trafford yesterday for the first time since his eight-match ban for racially abusing the United captain last October.

But one day after being branded a 'disgrace' for not shaking Evra's hand, Suarez, 25, issued an apology on Liverpool's website saying he let down 'the manager, the club and what it stands for'.

The apology from Suarez was issued after it emerged that the striker had told club officials he would shake Evra's hand before the game, only to go back on his word just before kick-off.

Liverpool's Managing Director Ian Ayre said today that Suarez 'had told us beforehand that he would, but then chose not to do so.

Mr Ayre's added in his own statement: 'He was wrong to mislead us and wrong not to offer his hand to Patrice Evra. He has not only let himself down, but also Kenny Dalglish, his teammates and the Club.

'It has been made absolutely clear to Luis Suarez that his behaviour was not acceptable.

'Luis Suarez has now apologised for his actions which was the right thing to do. However, all of us have a duty to behave in a responsible manner and we hope that he now understands what is expected of anyone representing Liverpool Football Club.'

Later, after United’s ill-tempered 2-1 win, emotions spilled over into violence as the players made their way back to the dressing room.

Looking as if he intended to confront Suarez, Evra found his path to the Uruguayan blocked by Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel.

It was the cue for five minutes of pushing and shoving in a melee in the players’ tunnel involving several members of both teams that eventually had to be broken up by police.

Evra had also celebrated the win after the final in enthusiastic fashion with a dejected-looking Suarez metres away.

Liverpool sought to draw a line under the issue today when Uruguayan striker issued an apology on the club's official website on Sunday lunchtime.

The statement from Suarez said: 'I have spoken with the Manager since the game at Old Trafford and I realise I got things wrong.

'I've not only let him down, but also the Club and what it stands for and I'm sorry. I made a mistake and I regret what happened.

'I should have shaken Patrice Evra's hand before the game and I want to apologise for my actions.

'I would like to put this whole issue behind me and concentrate on playing football.'

Evra's teammate Rio Ferdinand, who refused to shake Suarez's hand before kick-off, had his say on his colleague's exuberant celebrations in front of the Liverpool man on the final whistle.

Ferdinand, 33, tweeted this morning: 'I'm sure Patrice Evra will feel that his celebrations at the end were maybe a bit much....emotions etc probably got the better of him...'

Sir Alex, 70, described Suarez as a ‘disgrace to Liverpool’ and said he should not be allowed to play for the club again.

‘I couldn’t believe it. He could’ve started a riot,’ he added.

After the handshake brush-off, Evra, 30, tried to pull Suarez back by grabbing his arm, but the striker shrugged him off.

Moving along the line of players, Suarez, 25, then came to the French defender’s team-mate Rio Ferdinand. This time, he appeared happy to proffer his hand. But, clearly angry, Ferdinand kept his arms by his sides.

After the match, Sir Alex conceded that Evra’s enthusiastic celebrations in front of Suarez after the final whistle were inappropriate. ‘He shouldn’t have done that,’ he said.

After the racism row surrounding Suarez and Evra erupted again yesterday, ministers warned that football must not return to the 'bad old days'.

Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the failure of Suarez to shake Evra's hand was 'incredibly depressing'.

David Cameron is to hold a Downing Street summit to discuss the issue, while football's authorities and players' representatives will take part in a session later this month.

Shortly before kick-off, thousands of copies of a Manchester United fanzine were seized by police.

The edition of Red Issue included a spoof poster of a Ku Klux Klan hood along with the words ‘LFC’, shorthand for Liverpool Football Club, and ‘Suarez is innocent’.

Match commander Chief Superintendent Mark Roberts said the fanzines were seized because ‘we cannot be in a situation where hundreds or thousands of people were displaying offensive images’.

He said: 'Shortly before 
kick-off at [yesterday's] match between 
Manchester United and Liverpool, we were made aware that a Manchester 
United supporters' fanzine being sold outside Old Trafford featured a 
potentially offensive image.

'Officers
 are now seizing the fanzines and in consultation with the Crown 
Prosecution Service we will take appropriate action against anyone 
either found selling this particular fanzine or provocatively displaying
 the image in public.'

Nobody from Red Issue was available for comment.

In
 the match itself, Suarez was incessantly booed by Manchester United 
fans in a game which the home side eventually won thanks to a Wayne 
Rooney brace.

Suarez did manage to score for Liverpool but 
could not save his side from defeat.

The row prompted a welter of comment on Twitter. Manchester United striker John Cofie, currently on loan to Belgian side Royal Antwerp, said: ‘Now suarez I’d love the oppotunity [sic] to knock his ugly ass teeth out!’

Meanwhile, former England striker Stan Collymore said he had reported someone to the police after being racially abused on Twitter.
