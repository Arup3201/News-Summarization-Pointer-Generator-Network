Among the stream of letdowns to flow from England’s World Cup perhaps the most poignant poured from the lips of Eoin Morgan on Sunday.

Morgan is the most inventive England batsman of his generation, and that includes Kevin Pietersen. He is resolutely his own man – a Dubliner who crossed the Irish Sea, an advocate of the IPL in a country which often disdains it, and a thoughtful presence around the traps, alert with a hint of aloof.

But the system can drag down the best. And so, reflecting on the horrific nine-wicket loss to Sri Lanka in Wellington after England had scored 309 for 6, Morgan sought comfort in stats.

England captain Eoin Morgan found solace in statistics following the heavy defeat by Sri Lanka

First this: ‘We were 25 above par, and the stats backed that up. Par here is about 275-280.’

Then this: ‘We bowled a lot of bad balls. Over the next couple of days we’ll get the Hawk-Eye stuff, and the proof will be in that.’

Stats have always been a hallmark of Peter Moores’s England. Famously, he introduced Andy Flower to Moneyball, Michael Lewis’s classic account of sabermetrics (the statistical analysis of baseball); infamously, he allowed stats to encourage the selection of Darren Pattinson against South Africa in 2008.

Stats work – and they don’t. At their best, they confirm hunches. At their worst, they become a usefully faceless scapegoat: don’t blame us, we were only following the stats!

We exaggerate, but not by much. What, after all, is the relevance of stats when the change in fielding restrictions has made 300 the norm? And why defer to Hawk-Eye when Naked-Eye told you England bowled like drains?

Jos Buttler needs to be cut loose at the top of the batting order when the situation merits his promotion

The system isn’t working. If it were working – or even close to working – England would not have lost to Australia by 111 runs, to New Zealand with more than 37 overs to spare, and to Sri Lanka by nine wickets while defending over 300. The Associate nations are making a better fist of things.

So if not the system, then what? Poor Morgan, by nature a free spirit, has inherited a job weighed down by English caution. Roundheads are better at Tests; cavaliers prefer one-dayers. And England are playing a form of 50-over cricket more suited to Oliver Cromwell and 1645.

Conservatism continues to bedevil them. When Jos Buttler hit the fastest one-day hundred by an England batsman, against Sri Lanka at Lord’s, Alastair Cook told us he wasn’t ready for Test cricket. Alex Hales has not been trusted in the one-day side, despite producing the innings of the World Twenty20 last March. James Taylor has been shunted to No 6, after prospering at No 3.

James Taylor leaps to take a catch against Sri Lanka - and his position in the order has also dived to No 6

England have inverted one of the first rules of international sport, which is to do what the opposition least wants you to do. After Moeen Ali and Ian Bell put on 172 in 30 overs against Scotland, in came Gary Ballance, a talented batsman whose confidence is being undermined by being asked to slot straight into a demanding role on the biggest stage of all.

Why not Buttler, armed with a licence to do something violent? Instead, Ballance scratched around for 10 in 18 balls, England slowed down, and a near-certain score of 350-plus became 303 for 8. Beggars with terrible net run-rates cannot be choosers.

The total proved well beyond Scotland – but, funnily enough, not beyond Sri Lanka, whose 2-3-4-5 (Dilshan, Sangakkara, Jayawardene, Mathews) is as classy as anything in the tournament.

Yet, after Moeen and Bell had again provided a useful platform (62 in nine overs), England proceeded to potter around before the final assault, safe in the knowledge that the 300 was ‘25 above par’.

The lunacy is that, for perhaps the first time ever, this England team contains batsmen capable of casting off the straitjacket: Moeen, Taylor, Morgan and Buttler. And if AB de Villiers had played the lofted reverse-sweep for six produced by Joe Root during a Thisara Perera over costing 25, we’d never have heard the end of it.

There is talent in that dressing-room. There will be more to come: look at Sam Billings, Jason Roy and James Vince. But it is weighed down by the notion that one-day teams can rationalise their way to victory.

Here, England seemed to have borrowed not so much from Moneyball as from Annie Hall. In one scene from Woody Allen’s film a movie producer is overheard at a party: ‘Right now it’s only a notion, but I think I can get the money to make it into a concept and later turn it into an idea.’

England seem to believe that stats will ease them all the way through from notion to concept to idea to… World Cup success! This may work in Test cricket. It sure as hell doesn’t work in the 50-over game.

It may be too late to salvage anything from the wreckage of this tournament. But if England accept that stats-driven prudence is no way to win one-day internationals, they can yet challenge for the 2019 World Cup. 

THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS

New-ball nightmare

England’s over-planned batting is only part of their problem. After the weekend matches, they had claimed only 22 wickets in four games, a lower ratio than anyone except Zimbabwe and the UAE. And they had leaked 6.33 an over, more than anyone except West Indies.

The point has been made that England’s battery of right-arm seamers have become distinguishable only by height and hair colour. This is true. But it wouldn’t matter if their two biggest guns – Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad, with over 1,000 international wickets between them – were at their best.

Instead, they are suffering almost identical nightmares: both have two wickets and have gone at 6.27 an over, with Anderson averaging 91 to Broad’s 92. During England’s tour of Sri Lanka, it was regularly assumed the attack would be stronger for their return from injury. We’ll keep holding our breath.

Shifting the goalposts

There’s nothing like a(nother) World Cup fiasco to skew the debate. But: KP or not KP? – that is the question. Once this World Cup is over, it’s all about Test cricket: 17 matches in 10 months, including yet another Ashes. Yet the Test line-up looks settled, apart from an opening slot, where Pietersen wouldn’t bat anyway. Which of Ballance, Root, Bell or Moeen Ali are you going to drop?

And if Pietersen is to be brought back for the one-day team, you’d have to ask a fresh batch of questions about how seriously England are about winning the 2019 World Cup: Pietersen will turn 39 that June.

No-one can doubt his brilliance at the height of his one-day international career. But he drifted away from the 50-over format in his final year as an England player, and didn’t do especially well when he was picked. Yes, he’d put bums on seats and get people talking about cricket. But let’s not pretend he’d be the saviour of the English game.

Someone else’s problem

MS Dhoni earned a few pats on the back for saying, after India had thrashed the UAE, that the Associate nations needed more exposure at the highest level. But the devil was in the detail: that exposure, Dhoni intimated, could not come against India, who already have their hands full.

And there’s the rub. The big boys profess their support in theory, but with one crucial caveat: not on my patch. Cricket’s closed shop remains open all hours.
