Shortly before Saturday lunchtime Andrew Triggs Hodge, Pete Reed, Tom James and Alex Gregory were victorious at Eton Dorney in the men's coxless four. It triggered a gold rush, the likes of which had never been experienced by British Olympians.

Also on the water, Sophie Hosking and Katherine Copeland claimed gold with an emphatic win in the women's double scull, before Team GB continued their domination in the velodrome with victory in the women's team pursuit.

Then came those golden performances by Jess Ennis, Greg Rutherford and Mo Farah to round off a remarkable day for British sport.

There were more golds today - for Ben Ainslie on the waves at Weymouth and Andy Murray at Wimbledon - as well as a glut of bronzes and silvers.

And there was a clear winner in the women's marathon - the city of London, which made for a spectacular backdrop to the race.
