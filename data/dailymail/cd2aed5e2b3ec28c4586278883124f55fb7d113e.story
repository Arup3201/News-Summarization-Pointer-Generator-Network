Tuberculosis has spread through a Kansas high school after a single case of the disease was discovered. 

Some 27 people have tested positive for latent TB infection at the school in eastern Kansas. State and county health officials made the announcement on Wednesday after tests were conducted on more than 300 Olathe Northwest High  students and staff who came into contact with a student with TB disease.

Officials called people who tested positive on Monday and those with no sign of infection were to receive letters in the mail.

According to the Johnson County Department of Heath and Environment, those with TB infection were not contagious, do not feel sick and do not have symptoms.

People with TB disease can spread the bacteria to others, feel sick and have symptoms including fever, night sweats, cough and weight loss. 

Causes: Tuberculosis is spread from person to person through the air, when someone infected coughs, sneezes, laughs or sings. A person who breathes in the bacteria can become infected.

Symptoms: General symptoms may include feeling weak or sick, weight loss, fever and/or night sweats. Symptoms of TB of the lungs may include coughing, chest pain and/or coughing up blood.

Treatment: More than 13,000 cases are reported in the U.S. each year. There are also an estimated 10 to 15 million people in the U.S. who are infected with the TB germ, with potential to develop TB disease in the future. If a person gets a TB skin test and it comes back positive, they must take a variety of antibiotics daily for as long as six months.

Director of the health department, Lougene Marsh, said: 'The number of individuals with TB infection does not exceed what we would anticipate in this setting.'

Tuberculosis can be spread by coughing and sneezing. People with the disease were most likely to spread it to others with whom they have prolonged contact.

According to the CDC, TB is caused by a bacterium called mycobacterium tuberculosis which attacks the lungs but can also infect the kidneys, spine, and brain. If not treated properly, the disease can be fatal.

The Department of Heath and Environment said those who tested positive for TB will have a chest x-ray and begin a course of antibiotics to kill the TB bacteria. 

In May, those who were in the same class as the student with TB disease will be given another round of blood tests as it can sometimes take eight weeks for the bacteria to show itself. 

A total of 9,582 TB disease cases were reported in the U.S. in 2013 - compared to 84,304 cases when the CDC began records in 1953. 

The same year, 9 million people around the world became sick with TB disease, leading to 1.5 million deaths.
