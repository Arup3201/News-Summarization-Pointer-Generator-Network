A trainee nurse was left dripping with blood after she disturbed an intruder at her home - who slashed her across the face.

Gemma Ball, 20, needed internal stitches to the flesh in her face after a hooded man pulled a blade on her when she caught him in the back garden of her home in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs.

The student was terrified when the hooded intruder kicked her dog, sending it flying into a wall - before slashing her across the face, less than an inch from her eye socket, in broad daylight.

Sewn up: The gash was so deep that doctors were forced to re-open the wound after stitching it up to repair damage to the flesh underneath

The police have now released an image of a suspect they want to speak to in connection with the incident, which happened on September 24.

Gemma, who also works as a carer, said: 'My mum and dad had gone out to work early, and I was still in bed when I was woken up by the dogs barking.

'My cocker spaniels, Rosie and Bella, were going mad, so I let them outside, and they ran straight to the bottom of the garden.

'I followed them and I saw this man standing there - I froze in complete shock, and screamed at him to get out.

'Bella ran up to him, barking, because she knew he shouldn’t be there and could probably sense I was frightened.

'But he just gave her an almighty kick and she flew into the wall with a huge thud.

'I ran over to her and I saw him pull a flick knife out of his pocket.

'I thought he was coming to stab Bella, so I grabbed her, and next thing I knew she was covered in blood.

'I felt a sharp pain in my head, but I didn’t realise what had happened.

'He jumped over the fence and I heard him shout "Run!", and I ran inside with my dog.

'It was only when I ran past a mirror that I realised all the blood was coming from me, and there was a huge slash on my head.'

Police took Gemma to University Hospital of North Staffordshire, where she was given stitches to close the wound - but doctors realised some days later that her injury was not healing properly.

They were forced to cut open the wound again and stitch the flesh underneath to aid the healing process, before sewing the slashed layer of skin above back together.

She added: 'I am so scared to be at home by myself now - and poor Bella is really nervous.

'She wasn’t a very well dog to start with, and I’m lucky this didn’t kill her.'

Police are hunting the suspect, who was wearing a hat and coat fully zipped up, just revealing his eyes.

He is believed to be in his 30s, and of tall, slim build.

Anyone with information is asked to contact DC Becky Evans at Staffordshire Police on 101 quoting incident number 99 of September 24.
