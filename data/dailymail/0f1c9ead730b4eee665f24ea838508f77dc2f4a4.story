Her boyfriend Dominic Isom, 27, has already appeared before a judge accused of her murder and has been remanded in custody.

Miss Henderson was reported missing shortly after 8am on Thursday morning last week - nearly 18 hours after she was last seen collecting her children from Corfe Castle Primary School at around 3pm. 

Detective Inspector Neil Devoto, who is leading the inquiry, said: 'Family liaison officers have updated Samantha's family with today's development.  

'Clearly, this is a very difficult time for the whole family and they have requested privacy. Her children are being cared for by relatives.

'I would like to thank the public for all their help during this investigation and their patience and understanding, in particular the communities in the Corfe Castle and Hamworthy area who have seen a great deal of police activity over the last week. 

'I am still keen to hear from anyone who saw Samantha's blue Peugeot 307 estate car with the registration HV04 ZFM being driven in the Lake Pier and South Haven Close areas between 3pm on January 21 and 5pm on January 23 to contact me in confidence.

Search: Police are continuing searches at the edge of woodland next to the A351 at Norden, in Dorset

Major crime officers and forensics experts have combed allotments, outbuildings in the area as well as the missing mother's home

'I am urging anyone who saw anything suspicious in this area between the relevant times to get in touch.'

The scene remains cordoned off while forensic investigators carry out their examinations, with searches still taking place off the A351 near Corfe Castle. 

The Dorset coroner has also been informed of the discovery and formal identification is yet to take place.

Following the young mother's disappearance, police helicopters scoured the area, with 35 major crime officers and forensics experts combing allotments, outbuildings and the missing mother's home. 

Detectives seized Miss Henderson's blue Peugeot 307 from her home on Monday night and asked the public to help trace the car's movements – especially between 3pm on Wednesday and 10.25am on Thursday.

Dorset Police said she was a 'prolific phone user' but that her mobile had not been found. 

Appeal: Detectives still want the public's help trace her car's (pictured) movements – especially between 3pm on Wednesday and 10.25am on Thursday

Hunt: Detectives scoured the town of Corfe Castle, Dorset, where she was last seen a week ago

Isom, of Halves Cottages, Corfe Castle, appeared at Winchester Crown Court today where he denied Ms Henderson's murder. He will face trial later this year.

He is charged with murdering her on January 21 - the day she was last seen alive.

Miss Henderson, who has children aged six, four, two and one, was reported missing at 8.43am on January 22. 

On Monday, police released CCTV showing the missing mother on the day she vanished. 

She can be seen in the footage moving animatedly around the shop wearing a pink jumper or coat and light blue jeans. Her long blonde hair is tied up in a ponytail.

She appears to buy cigarettes from behind the counter while chatting to the shopkeeper and hesitates at the till as she enters her pin number before leaving the shop.
