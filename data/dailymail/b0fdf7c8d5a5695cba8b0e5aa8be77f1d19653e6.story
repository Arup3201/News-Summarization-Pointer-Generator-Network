For a goalkeeper widely viewed as a liability in the first part of the season, Simon Mignolet's transformation has been quite remarkable.

The Liverpool stopper hasn't conceded a Premier League goal in 390 minutes, playing his role in a New Year resurgence that sees the Reds thinking about the top four again.

The Belgian hasn't let in a goal since the hour mark of their New Year's Day draw With Leicester City, subsequently keeping clean sheets in the league fixtures with Sunderland, Aston Villa, West Ham and Everton.

For all the criticism levelled at him, Mignolet's clean sheet record compares favourably with his Premier League peers.

Only Southampton's Fraser Forster (11) and Swansea's Lukasz Fabianski (9) have recorded more shutouts than Mignolet's eight. West Brom's Ben Foster has also kept eight clean sheets and has played one game more than Mignolet.

But the Liverpool man still has a better record of clean sheets than the likes of David de Gea, Thibaut Courtois and Hugo Lloris.

Mignolet's form had become so patchy he was dropped by Rodgers for the match with Manchester United at Old Trafford back in December.

Brad Jones took over for that game and subsequent matches with Bournemouth in the Capital One Cup and Arsenal in the league before suffering an injury at Burnley.

Since being restored to the side, Mignolet seems to have eradicated some of the mistakes, especially with crosses and in one-on-one situations, that had caused Rodgers such anxiety.

The manager noted his improvement in comments made last week: 'Simon's shown the benefits of having a bit of time out of the side.

'He looks like a different goalkeeper. Simons's spell out was for him to take a step back, analyse performance and the areas where he could improve.

Mignolet has also kept more clean sheets than Chelsea stopper and compatriot Thibaut Courtois 

Brendan Rodgers has been impressed by Mignolet's transformation since he was dropped from the team

'He's a wonderful shot-stopper, he's starting to be more aggressive with crosses and is probably thinking less.

'I'm delighted for him because he has worked very hard at his game.'

Mignolet will be vital as Liverpool hurtle into an important phase of the season - they play fellow top-four contenders Tottenham at Anfield on Tuesday night, then head to Crystal Palace in the FA Cup fifth round.

Next week also sees the resumption of their Europa League campaign with two legs against Turkish side Besiktas.
