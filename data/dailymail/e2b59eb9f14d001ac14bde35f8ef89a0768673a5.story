For whom would you make a mixtape?

There was a time (back in the lower reaches of the early Nineties) when a personalised mixtape with an inlay sleeve garnished with doodles and sweet nothings was just about the most romantic present you could ever give someone.

But the advent of the internet, the iTunes playlist and the Spotify invite sounded the death knell for those halcyon days of holding music on something physical and swooning. Until now.

The mixtape - or, rather, the mix CD - is having a renaissance, thanks to an online service enabling you to craft your own bespoke disc and design the cover sleeve.

Described as 'Moonpig meets iTunes', London-based music start-up MixPixie has licensing deals with record labels including Sony, Universal, EMI and Warner, so boasts over 15 million songs on their database. They also have more than 500 album designs to choose from.

Chef Nigella Lawson, singer Olly Murs and comedian Alan Carr have proclaimed themselves fans, while the brand has worked with musicians including Justin Bieber and Lionel Richie to craft personalised albums.

Commenting on the service, Nigella Lawson said she was 'thoroughly going to enjoy' her CD, while Alan Carr said: 'Lovely personalised CDs... How did YOU know I loved Jennifer Rush's Power Of Love? Ha Ha.'

Customers can pick from a list of pre-made designs - including those for a new baby, an engagement, a birthday, holiday, exams and retirement - each of which come with a list of suggested songs to feature on your unique playlist.

You can also add to the personalised aspect of the product by uploading your own photo for the cover, and adding a recorded voice message for the recipient.

Each £5 CD can have a maximum of 10 songs, each of which cost an additional 99p, and you can review what it will look like before you part with your cash and have the finished product delivered to your door for £2.99.

The idea for the service came about in 2009 when record company executive Buffie du Pon, then 31, found a romantic Valentine's Day mix CD on her doormat.... but addressed to someone called Sarah.

Dispirited that it wasn't for her but inspired by the retro idea, Buffie met up with her friends Adam Goodyer and James Perkins and MixPixie was born. She still has the CD for Sarah.

MixPixie enables you to craft retro personalised mix CDs from a database of 13 million songs and 500 album designs

Each CD starts at £5, and you can add up to 10 songs on each album at an additional cost of 99p
