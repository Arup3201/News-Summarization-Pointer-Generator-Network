A 114-year-old woman who challenged Facebook after the social media site wouldn't let her list her real age has died in Minnesota.

Anna Stoehr, one of the nation's oldest residents, died Sunday in her sleep after several days in hospice care, according to her son, Harlan Stoehr.

'I don't think mother intended to live forever,' Harlan told KARE-11. 'She just got farther than most.'

Facebook: Stoehr drew national attention earlier this year when she challenged Facebook's age policy; the social media site wouldn't allow her to list her actual birth year

Verified: Stoehr, born in 1900,  was hailed as the oldest Minnesota resident, and was the seventh oldest person verified to be living in the U.S.

She drew national attention this year after  her attempt to create a Facebook account. 

Usually, most women would jump at the chance to claim a younger age, but not Stoehr. 

The social media site wouldn't let her enter a birth year before 1905, so she listed her age as 99. However, she wrote a letter -- fittingly, on an old type writer -- to the company saying, 'I'm still here.'

In response, Facebook sent her a bouquet of 114 flowers for her most recent birthday, her son said.

Now, however, the popular site founded by Mark Zuckerberg still does not allow users to choose a birth year earlier than 1905.

Profile: Stoehr's has 32 friends on her Facebook page and a photo she posted (shown above) has been shared more than 200 times on the social media site since it was posted in September

Harlan told KARE that Anna's obituary will list two apple trees she planted at the age of 105 among her survivors. 

Stoehr's funeral will be held Saturday in Potsdam.

Born in Iowa in 1900, Anna Stoehr's family moved to Wisconsin and South Dakota before settling in Ridgeway, Minnesota, in 1919. 

She lived in Minnesota the rest of her life, her son said.

The Gerontology Research Group, which tracks many of the world's longest-living people, said Anna Stoehr was the oldest verified resident of Minnesota..

Stoehr was hailed as the oldest Minnesota resident, and was the seventh oldest person verified to be living in the U.S., according to Robert Young, a senior database administrator for the research group.

The oldest woman in the U.S. is Gertrude Weaver, a 116-year-old woman from Arkansas.

Stoehr's death comes just two days before that of Conrad Johnson, the 110 year-old man who was recognized as the oldest man in the U.S.

Johnson's title is now held by Wash Wesley, a 111-year-old deacon from Illinois.

Young said living to age '114 is extremely rare.'

 But he said the most amazing thing about Stoehr wasn't just her age, but the fact that she was willing to try new things, including Facebook and smartphones.

Harlan  said his mother was sharp until the end.

He joked that when he saw her a week ago, 'it was like she was 112 again.'
