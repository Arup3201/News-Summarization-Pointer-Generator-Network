A lost GoPro which travelled at least 60km across the ocean floor  could be reunited with its owner after it was discovered by a passer-by.

Luke Shepley was camping at North Stradbroke Island in Queensland when he came across the well-worn camera lying on the shore. 

'We were chasing pippies for bait so we were walking along the sand and searching and all of a sudden come across a GoPro and it was still in power,' Mr Shepley told Daily Mail Australia. 

The most recent video on the lost GoPro showed the suspected owner (pictured) surfing in early January

After taking it home with them and hooking it up to a computer, he and a friend searched the contents in an effort to locate the owner.

The most recent video showed a young man catching a wave on his surfboard to which the GoPro appeared to be attached.

But just as he stands, the camera is seen tumbling off the surfboard and into the ocean before it sinks to the sand.

He believes its owner was in Surfers Paradise after identifying some of the buildings in the last video

'It's 60kms roughly straight from where it was dropped to where I found it and they don't float,' Mr Shepley said

Determined to find the owner and hand him back the expensive device, which contained over 70 videos, Mr Shepley and his friends managed to identify the skyscrapers in the background as belonging to the Surfers Paradise skyline.

'If I lost something like that and someone put in that effort, that would mean the most to me,'Mr Shepley (pictured) said

'There's a selfie of him on the board and in the background there's building and we identified the buildings which we noticed were similar to the ones at Surfers by using Google Earth,' Mr Shepley said.

'It's 60kms roughly straight from where it was dropped to where I found it and they don't float! 

'They sink straight to the bottom so the fact that it was travelling along the ocean floor for that distance is quite amazing. 

'And after a month it still has battery life - that's a pretty good advertisement for a GoPro.'

Mr Shepley has now launched a social media campaign in an effort to find the device's original owner.

'Technology these days gives people the option for them to track down their stuff.

'If I lost something like that and someone put in that effort, that would mean the most to me,' he said.

'He might say he's not interested but at least he has go the opportunity.'
