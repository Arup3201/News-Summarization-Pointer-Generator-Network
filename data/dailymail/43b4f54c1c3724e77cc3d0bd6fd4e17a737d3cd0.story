A manhunt is underway after a spurned lover forced his ex-girlfriend to tie her daughter to a chair and watch as he fatally shot the young woman in the head.

Roy Parmley, of Lapel, Indiana, broke into the home of Terri Wiles, 53, and her 31-year-old daughter last Friday, just two days after the mother ended their two-year relationship.

When the two women arrived at the property, they found Parmley waiting for them, brandishing shotguns, according to the Herald Bulletin.

His had smashed his way in through a patio door and his hands were covered in blood.

The 53-year-old forced his ex-girlfriend to use duct tape to tie Amanda Raquel Wiles to a chair in the kitchen, according to the affidavit filed at Madison County Court.

Parmley then bound his ex-girlfriend to a chair and told her that he would ‘take something away from her that she loved more than him,’ and shot Amanda Wiles in the head with a shotgun. 

The suspect fled the property on foot after telling Terri Wiles that he was going to kill himself. The horrified mother was able to free herself and called 911.

‘This is possibly a result of a relationship where one person decided they didn't want the relationship anymore,’ Madison County Sheriff Ron Richardson told WRTV.

An warrant has been issued for Parmley's arrest on charges of murder, burglary resulting in bodily injury, and two counts of criminal confinement.

Unhinged: Parmley¿s sister, Brenda Shaffer, said Parmley had been unstable since losing his father and wife to different illnesses

He is yet to be found and is believed to be suicidal, and armed and dangerous.

'We're using ATVs, golf carts. We had a helicopter here from state police early this morning, canines from other departments,' Richardson told the station on Saturday.

Ryan Edwards, Amanda Wiles' boyfriend, told the Herald Bulletin that he had received a distressing call from her in the week before her tragic death.

He told how his on-off girlfriend said she wanted him to attend her funeral, adding: ‘I just want you to know I love you very, very much. If anything ever happens to me, I want you to know I love you from the bottom of my heart.’

Edwards told the newspaper that the disconcerting conversation led him to believe that Parmley, an alcoholic known for his impulsive behaviour, had been threatening her for some time.

'Why would she say all that stuff out of the blue?' he said. 'Deep down, she knew Roy was crazy.'

Edwards’ Facebook page has since been flooded with tributes to Amanda Wiles. ‘I love you very much Ma,’ he posted on Sunday.

‘I will always miss your beautiful face and I look forward to when we meet again in the house that God had made for us.’

Edwards also told how Parmley was unhinged, 
recounting how he was often struck by fits of jealousy and how he once 
shot a rabbit in their garden to pieces for no reason.

Parmley’s sister, Brenda Shaffer, said Parmley had been unstable since losing his father and wife to different illnesses.

'We love our brother, and we’re very sorry that this disease, which I believe, destroyed lives,' she said. 'Right now we don’t know if he’s dead or alive,' she said.

Spurned: 'This is possibly a result of a relationship where one person decided they didn't want the relationship anymore,' Madison County Sheriff Ron Richardson said
