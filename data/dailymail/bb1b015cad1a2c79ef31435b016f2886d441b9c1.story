Questions have emerged over whether the world record for the most people simultaneously twerking was set on Wednesday - after claims it was actually set last month by nearly 2,000 people.

The Guinness World Records verified yesterday's attempt in New York's Herald Square, where 358 people - including a 73-year-old woman - gyrated and bounced for two minutes straight.

But in August, 1,945 people were filmed twerking at the same time on the Teen Choice Awards in Los Angeles and it was verified by world record-certifying website RecordSetter.com.

Participants were required 'to shake their hips in an up and down bounce motion' and had to 'twerk in unison for at least five seconds' in order to set the record.

Real record? Nearly 2,000 people twerked at the same time during the Teen Choice Awards, according to RecordSetter.com, which far surpasses the 358 people in New York on Wednesday

When the co-founders of RecordSetter.com learned about Wednesday's 'new' record, they were stunned that it had claimed the title, they told The Daily Beast.

'We were surprised to see Guinness recognize today's twerking event as a world record,' co-founder Dan Rollman said. 'While their category title was slightly different and rules varied slightly on performance style and length of dance time, the categories are, in essence, nearly identical.'

He added that although he admires Guinness, he believes that calling their event 'a legitimate world record' is simply not true.

But Guinness World Records said they had never received a proposal for the attempt made at the Teen Choice Awards so did not consider it the record.

Jamie Panas, a PR manager with the Guinness World Records, told the Daily Beast: 'As every Guinness World Records proposal is accompanied by its own set of guidelines which the participants must adhere to, we cannot thoroughly assess whether or not a record was set as we were not involved.

Rollman countered that although RecordSetter.com and Guiness World Records are separate, a world record is a world record.

Wednesday's
event was organized by Big Freedia, the self proclaimed 'Queen of 
Bounce', and she was joined by a 73-year-old participant, Joan Wind.

'It was great. I think today for the two minutes I lost a few pounds,' Wind from Stuyvesant Town told the New York Daily News.

Dancing with the best of them, Wind said that she was just out buying sheets in Macy's when she saw the record and decided to join in.

'It was a wonderful experience 
today,' she said. 'I went to buy sheets in Macy’s, and they let me in, 
and I’m just dancing my life away here. It was just great.'

All
the twerking dancers were handed out cards instructing them as to the 
proper moves required to for the record attempt and all managed to for 
the two minutes needed for the record.

The
popularity, or even infamy of twerking reached a crescendo last month 
when Miley Cyrus used the suggestive dance during her duet with Robin 
Thicke at the MTV Video Music Awards last month at Brooklyn's Barclays 
Center.

Twerking is 
reported to have originated in New Orleans' bounce music scene back in 
1993, with DJ Jubilee’s song 'Do the Jubilee All.'
