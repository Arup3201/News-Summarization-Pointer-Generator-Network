This is the moment a suspected Irish bomber blew himself up after it was believed that he forgot about the clocks going forward an hour for British Summer Time.

Police are investigating whether the man, who was allegedly seen running from the scene covered in blood, had injured himself in the blast because he had got his timings wrong when the clocks changed.

Officers suspect the bomber planted an explosive device under a Volvo SUV in the centre of Dublin and that it had either gone off too early, or he had returned to the car to investigate why it had not detonated.

Police believe the high-grade explosives then went off in his face, leaving him with injuries to his head and upper body.

Witnesses said they saw a man running from the scene at around 11pm on Sunday with blood on his face, before he climbed into a taxi.

'This certainly was a high-grade explosive used in this bomb. It wasnâ€™t garbage stuff,' a police source told the Daily Mirror.

'It would appear the bomber got his timings wrong.'

The source added that the bomber may not have realised just how powerful the explosives were, and that had anyone been in or close to the car at the time of the blast they could have been killed.

The car, belonging to a local businessman, was destroyed in the explosion, and the doors and windows of a nearby house were blown out.

The Army's bomb squad was deployed to the site of the explosion, close to St Patrick's Cathedral.

Police do not believe the attack was linked to paramilitary activity, but instead involved criminal gangs.

Superintendent Dave Taylor said the Garda was looking for anyone who may have picked up the suspect.

He added: 'It was a very extensive explosion and it was a very frightening experience for the people on Long Lane.

'The consequences could have been very, very serious.'
