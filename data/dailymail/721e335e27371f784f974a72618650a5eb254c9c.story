Furious protesters clashed with police in Madrid yesterday in a huge anti-austerity demonstration.

Tens of thousands of people were seen on the streets of the Spanish capital, in a protest against government cuts, and high unemployment.

Six riot officers were injured as activists hurled bottles, bricks and fireworks and beat authorities back with batons, according to a police statement.

the governing conservative Popular Party before police then charged the protesters.

One
 police vehicle and a bank were damaged. It wasn't 
immediately clear how many protesters were injured, and if anybody was 
seriously hurt on either side.

The activists say Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's government has eroded Spain's much-valued public health and education systems, while saddling Spaniards with sky-high unemployment and more debt.

Six columns of protesters - each from a different region of Spain - arrived at the outskirts of the city early Saturday before heading for Colon square, carrying banners bearing the slogan 'Marching for Dignity.'

By late afternoon, Madrid's principal boulevard, Paseo del Prado, was packed with people.

'I don't want corruption, government cuts and unemployment,' said office worker Susana Roldan, 24. 'What I want is a secure future in Spain.'

Michael Nadeau, a 44-year-old entrepreneur, added: 'I'm here to fight for my children's future.'For those who are in power we're just numbers. They value money more than they value people.'

Rajoy's majority conservative government has pushed several waves of tough tax hikes and cuts through parliament in an attempt to reduce the country's deficit.

Spain's recession was triggered five years ago when a housing bubble burst causing a Â£30billion bailout of the country's banks and massive job losses across the country

Since then the country has been plagued with one of the highest unemployment rates in Europe

Even as the nation emerged from its recession in 2013, the unemployment rate has remained at 26 per cent

A housing bubble burst more than five 
years ago, forcing a 41-billion euro ($56 billion) bailout of the 
country's banks, squeezing homeowners and throwing millions out of work.

The
 government introduced public sector austerity to whittle down the 
deficit, provoking widespread anger amongst middle- and low-income 
families as dozens of cases of corruption in the ruling class are 
investigated by judges.

Spain tentatively exited a recession in the 
second half of 2013 but unemployment soared with a labour reform which 
reduced the cost of hiring and firing. The hoped-for boost in jobs has 
yet to materialise.

'Employment difficulties are highly concentrated 
in the most disadvantaged households, with 1 out of 6 working-age adults
 living in jobless households - twice as many as before the crisis,' the
 OECD said in a report published earlier this week.

'Overall, the 
poorest 10 percent faced income losses at a rate of 14 percent per year,
 resulting in a fall of more than one third during 2007-2010. This is by
 far the largest drop in the OECD,' it added.

The protest includes trade unions, civil servants and organizations representing people evicted from their homes for not being able to make mortgage payments after losing their jobs.
