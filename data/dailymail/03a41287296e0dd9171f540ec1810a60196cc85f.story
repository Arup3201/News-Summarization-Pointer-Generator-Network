To the thinly disguised chagrin of a pitiful coven of hacks who regard boxing as so barbaric that they campaign for its abolition, The Greatest is still alive to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the most famous fight in ring history.

Muhammad Ali launched a week of reminiscences about the Rumble in the Jungle by tweeting a happy snapshot of himself and some of his family and announcing that he feels just fine.

Not for the first time, reports of his death have been exaggerated.

Not that this inconvenient truth has prevented some critics from using the occasion to dwell on how Parkinson’s disease has silenced the most voluble athlete of all time and diminished his physical powers.

In the awkward realisation that they would be mocked for denigrating one of the most remarkable sporting achievements of all time, they pay grudging lip service to the scale of Ali’s accomplishment in Zaire on the sweltering night of October 30, 1974.

Then they rain opprobrium on that parade, citing medical speculation as to how the many punches he took before his astonishing knock-out of Big Foreman might have damaged his brain.

Such is the hypocrisy of those who rarely, if ever, deign to take a seat at ringside yet refuse to recognise the potential of boxing for strengthening the moral character of young men (and women), or their right to choose that path out of poverty.

Of course there can be harmful consequences of absorbing heavy blows to the head. But those who deem the risks not worth taking are not entitled to make currency of boxing’s most captivating moments.

They simply can’t have it both ways.

If they insist that a bright boy from the mean streets of Louisville should never have been permitted to lace up the gloves, they have no place riding the tail of the comet he blazed across our universe. 

Boxing was the making of Ali. It gave vivid expression to the most compelling voice of all our sporting generations and made his face the most recognisable on the planet.

Would it really have been preferable for him to be dragged down into the criminal depths of the ghetto than to accumulate fame and fortune while becoming the champion of world heavyweight prize-fighting and the civil rights movement?

The man himself does not think so. 

Boxing took Ali from the streets to make him the most recognisable face on the planet

60,000 roaring fans packed Kinshasa’s outdoor Stade du 20 Mai for the fight.

32 -year-old Ali was seven years older than his opponent and a fading former champ not expected to last more than three rounds. It is said that in the dressing room, Foreman and his ringside crew had knelt to pray that he did not kill Ali.

450 locations in the United States and Canada — and in some cinemas in the United Kingdom — screened the fight on closed-circuit television.

100 countries were estimated to have taken the fight, which was scheduled to start at 4.0am in Zaire to accommodate audiences in the US.

10 million dollars was split between the two — $5m each — paid for by President Mobutu.

45 Foreman first quit in 1977 and returned in the early Nineties — winning the world title again at 45, becoming the oldest heavyweight champion in history.

The last time he was able to whisper in my hearing he recalled with eye-twinkling relish the dramatic turbulence of his prime years. But he also attested to contentment with the tranquillity of his current condition and the time that now gives him for profound reflection on his life and times.

The Rumble in the Jungle is a pillar of his momentous life. As was his first winning of the world title.

Those twin slayings of giants perceived as monsters came 10 years apart.

In 1964, he ‘shook up the world,’ as he put it, by reducing a seemingly indestructible bear of a man called Sonny Liston to a demoralised wreck.

In 1974 he returned to defy all predictions once more by making a Rope-a-Dope of the formidable, intimidating Foreman.

If anything, the Rumbling of Foreman was more astonishing than the Crumbling of Liston.

As Cassius Clay, in his first incarnation, he was a phenomenal athlete as well as a luminous mind.

As Muhammad Ali, deep into his spiritual conversion, he was deemed a veteran pugilist surviving on those quick wits.

Another genius, of sorts, helped Ali nag at Foreman’s psyche.

By persuading Zaire’s President Mobuto to bestow $10million of his ill-gotten gains on the protagonists - $5m each - flamboyant promoter Don King provided an unusual stage better suited to Ali’s multi-faceted flair for the dramatic.

The stadium would be a hot-house of more than 50,000 spectators, all entranced by the legend of The Greatest.

The capital city of what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo became a captivated theatre for Ali the Entertainer. And his electrifying impact on the local population grew and intensified after Foreman suffered an eye-cut in training and King insisted they all stay in Zaire for the extra month needed for him to heal.

While Big George growled and grumbled in his lair, Ali went out to engage with the people. The mood of apprehension for the former champ gradually shifted into an inkling that he just might shock the world again.

When Ali came into that boiling arena he rekindled concern for his well-being by lolling on those ropes and allowing Foreman to belabour him with blows of tree-felling power.

Occasionally Ali peppered Foreman with counter-combinations. Most demoralisingly of all, he kept asking his opponent: ‘Is that all you’ve got, George?’

By the eighth round he had the answer he wanted. Foreman had punched himself out, so Ali knocked him out with a right hook of devastating precision.

After a split-second of stunned silence, the stadium and the wide world of closed circuit television went into raptures.

Muhammad Ali was indeed The Greatest. Always would be. No matter what followed, be it epic victory over Smokin’ Joe Frazier in similarly exotic Manila or subsequent decline towards an inevitable and dreadful beating by Larry Holmes.

There can be no certainty about which punch or punches may have triggered the shaking hands or trembling vocal chords.

What we can be sure of is that the man himself apportions no blame to the sport which made him a king of every jungle, be it concrete, political or simply dense with foliage.

Rather he would have us celebrate the anniversary of that Rumble in Africa. That, and the defiance of Parkinson’s for more than 30 years after diagnosis which appends another famous victory to his record.

At 72, there is no knowing how long his final battle might last. No knowing what next week might bring.

But for the moment, like all of us who love the hard old game and respect the valour of its participants, George Foreman is remembering Ali.

Not with a frown. With a smile.
