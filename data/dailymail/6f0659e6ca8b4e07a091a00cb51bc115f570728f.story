John Freeman, the former politician credited with inventing the television interview, has died at the age of 99

Politician, magazine editor and pioneering television interviewer John Freeman has died, aged 99, it was reported last night.

Mr Freeman was the last person living today who had been elected to Parliament in the landslide Labour victory of 1945, when he became the Labour MP for Watford. 

His loyal toast at the opening of Parliament prompted Winston Churchill to weep ‘all the best young men are on the other side now.’

But John Freeman was best known for his work on televison, in particular his series of Face to Face interviews on the BBC during the 1960s. He is often credited with having invented the political interview.

Freeman’s face was never shown on Face to Face. 

Instead attention was focused on the subject of the interview, including merciless closeups, while viewers saw only Freeman’s back and the curl of smoke from his cigarette.

He was renowned for his persistence and direct approach as an interviewer.

Freeman’s own life was one of paradoxes. Born 19 February, 1915, the son of a Chancery barrister from whom he inherited his hard, analytical mind, it was reported that he was invited to eat with his father only once a week.

Educated at Westminster School, he saw active service in The Second World War and was appointed MBE in 1943. 

He became a presenter of Panorama before editing New Statesman magazine and presenting Face to Face. 

Harold Wilson appointed him British High Commissioner to India (1965-68) and he became Ambassador in Washington DC (1969-71).

He went on to become Chairman of LWT in 1971, serving until his retirement in 1984.

Then, aged 69, he decided to move on again. Giving up everything he moved abroad with his third family to California where he became a visiting professor of international relations.

He returned to the UK in 1990.

John Freeman married four times and was known as something of a ladies man, conducting numerous affairs.

In his professional life, however, he remained low key, and refused to embrace any form of celebrity.

In 2005 he wrote: ‘When I retired from even the out reaches of public responsibility, I resolved to put that life completely out of mind – to forget it all, in fact.’

In recent years John Freeman had been living in a military care home in South London.
