Please ensure your seatbelt is fastened for take-off and that all carry-on items are stored securely so that aisles and exits are clear.

And then sit back, relax and enjoy the inflight entertainment courtesy of the cabin crew.

Not standard procedure by any means, but some passengers were lucky enough to receive a free dance performance from a flight attendant as they waited for take-off.

Standing at the front of the plane, presumably after she had delivered her safety speech, the flight attendant - who it is believed works for Canadian airline WestJet - can be seen strumming along to a beat.

As the vocals to Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars’ 'Uptown Funk' kick in the lady springs into action and begins throwing some moves.

One passenger attempts to film her from the aisle, but quickly retreats his phone after the dancer begins moving towards him.

Returning to her original position the lady continues boogying until the music ceases and she is met with a round of applause from the passengers.

Judging by the lady’s uniform she is a flight attendant with WestJet Airlines, a budget carrier from Canada.

Reddit user Simian_King, who uploaded the original video, claims that the lady is his sister and a breakdancer turned flight attendant.

However, despite this, she in fact appears to be locking – a style of funk dancing associated with Hip-Hop that involves freezing a certain movement from a fast moving position before continuing at the same speed.

Judging by the her uniform, the lady who performs to the passengers on the flight is an employee of Canada's WestJet Airlines
