The BJP is collapsing under the weight of its own heavyweights in UP.

Minutes after the appointment of Pankaj Singh - son of party's former president Rajnath Singh - as general secretary of the UP unit on Sunday, three senior state-level functionaries tendered their resignation in protest.

Daya Shanker Singh, Santosh Singh and Ashwini Tyagi - who have forwarded their resignations to party president Nitin Gadkari are UP BJP secretaries.

Pankaj, who is much junior to them, also held the same post before being promoted.

Confirming his resignation, Daya Shanker said: 'The BJP is turning into a concentration camp where its committed workers are victimised. When it comes to managing the election campaign, the party remembers us. But when it comes to promotion, our national leadership gives it to someone just because he is the son of a senior leader. My two colleagues and I have sent our resignations to Gadkari in protest against his decision to promote Pankaj.'

He alleged that Rajnath had blackmailed the party's central leadership into promoting his son.

'Pankaj is dependent on his father to save himself from the wrath of state BJP leaders who have been struggling for over a decade to get a key post in the organisation. Although he was secretary of UP BJP since 2010, he was never seen in the party's state headquarters,' Daya Shanker said.

Santosh Singh and Ashwini Tyagi could not be reached over their phones.

A senior national BJP leader described Pankaj as a 'friend of criminals', referring to his meeting with jailed mafia don Dhananjay Singh.

'Pankaj was denied a ticket from both Lucknow (east) and Varanasi. So, it appears that Rajnath blackmailed Gadkari into getting him promoted as general secretary,' he added.

BJP spokesman Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said: 'He [Pankaj] was asking for an election ticket. This may be the reason that an alternative responsibility was assigned to him.'
