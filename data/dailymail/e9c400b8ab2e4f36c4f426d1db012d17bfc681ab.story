There’s nothing more inconvenient than your washing machine breaking down when you’re wearing your last pair of clean pants - even worse when it’s late at night and your local launderette is closed.

So could 24-hour outdoor laundry machines be the answer to all your washing woes?

The Southglade Convenience Store in Bestwood, Nottingham certainly thinks so, as the shop has installed three of the giant appliances in their car park.

At your convenience: The 24-hour washer and dryer are expected to be a hit in Nottingham

Bright idea: Thomas White, a security guard, is pictured here using the Revolution 24 outdoor washer and dryer in Bestwood, Nottingham

That's a load off his mind! The machine can be used 24 hours a day, washing detergent and softer are supped by the machine

There are two washing machines and one drier in the forecourt outside, so shoppers can do their washing while they stock up on groceries.

The Revolution outdoor washer and dryer also solves the pesky conundrum of where to do an urgent wash-load if your own machine is on the brink.

The machine can be used 24 hours a day, washing detergent and softener are supplied by the machine.

Store owner Kuldeep Singh Lalli says the machines have had quite a bit of interest since they were up and running last week

Kuldeep Singh Lalli, 61, the owner of the Premier store, was approached by national company Photo Me with the idea, which is already used in France.

The Grandad-of-two, who has run the store for two years, said: 'Quite a few people have used the machines but once people realise what's going on we're expecting them to be used a lot more.

'People are generally quite confused - they want to know why there are washing machines outside - and when I tell them what it's about, most people seem to think it's a really good idea.

Not going anywhere: 'Because of the weight of the machines,' there's no way they could be removed without a forklift truck, so we're not too worried about thefts,' says Mr Singh Lalli

He says it’s had quite a bit of interest since the machines were up and running last week.

'Because of the weight of the machines, there's no way they could be removed without a forklift truck, so we're not too worried about thefts.

'I think it could be a success once word gets around, and I'm pleased to be involved with it.'

Let's just hope it doesn't start raining when you come to haul your fresh wash load home.
