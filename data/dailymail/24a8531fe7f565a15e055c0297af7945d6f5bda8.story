While most of the UK continues to be deluged by rain - the early signs of spring have already made an appearance in one Devon town.

Keen gardener Brian Rickard saw the first daffodils in his Plymouth, Devon, flowerbeds bloom in time for Christmas.

The bright yellow flower made an appearance despite the town enduring 128.8mm of rain already in December - surpassing its monthly average for this time of year of 118.8mm.

Looking good: Although Mr Rickard usually sees his daffodils flower in December, he says that this is the earliest they have ever made an appearance

Although Mr Rickard usually sees his daffodils flower in December, he says that this is the earliest they have ever made an appearance.

Mr Rickard said: 'They have been out since December 15. Everybody who goes past is amazed.

'We always seem to have the first out. People are always saying "how on earth do you do it?".

'We don’t do anything at all. We just planted them and left them. I think it is because we are in a sheltered valley.

He added: 'These are in the front garden, which is south facing so it’s a bit warmer.'

Brian, 73, a retired university technician, said neither he, nor his wife Mary, knew what variety the bulbs were.

'I haven’t a clue,' he said.

'It’s team work. Mary does the weeding and I do the planting and digging.

'It does cheer you up, seeing daffodils at Christmas.'

Although normally planted in Autumn, daffodils develop their roots over several months before flowering in the spring.

Mr Rickard's daffodils were not the only ones to flower two months early.

More daffodils were spotted in Westward Ho!, Devon.
