Arjen Robben scored twice on his 31st birthday as Bayern Munich returned to home soil for their first match in Germany since their Bundesliga winter break. 

Pep Guardiola's side have only played one match since mid-December - a friendly in Saudi Arabia - and they ran out 5-1 winners at second-division side Bochum, ahead of the second-half of their league season kicking off at Wolfsburg next weekend.

It did not start as planned for the German champions, when their lowly opponents - who could, though, boast Mikael Forssell among their substitutes - scored through Danny Latza in the fifth minute.

Bochum: Esser, Fabian, Perthel, Celozzi, Bastians, Sestak, Losilla, Latza, Tasaka, Terodde, Gunduz

Goals: Latza 5 

Bayern Munich: Neuer, Rafinha, Boateng, Dante, Robben, Schweinsteiger, Alonso, Ribery, Bernat, Muller, Lewandowski

Goals: Robben 26, 78, Dante 43, Gotze 66, Rode 84 

Birthday boy Robben levelled the scores on 26, before setting Dante for the second just before half-time.

Former Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina came on at half-time, and could boast a clean sheet come the final whistle.

In the end, it was simple for the German giants, despite an early scare. Mario Gotze made it 3-1, before Robben grabbed his second and Bayern's fourth 12 minutes from time.

The result was complete when Sebastian Rode made it 5-1, as Guardiola brought on nine substitutes in the space of 15 minutes.

At the start of the second half, MIchael Esser did enough to deny Robert Lewandowsi a goal

David Alaba, Gotze, Rode, Holger Badstuber, Mehdi Benatia, Claudio Pizarro, Mitchell Weiser, Gianluca Gaudino and Sinan Kurt were all given a run-out, as Guardiola flexed his muscles to show the depth of his squad.

Bayern travel to second-placed Wolfsburg next weekend having already extended an 11-point gap between themselves and their opponents prior to the game.

Three points in Wolfsburg would take Bayern 14 points clear - a difference that would take a near-miracle to overcome.
