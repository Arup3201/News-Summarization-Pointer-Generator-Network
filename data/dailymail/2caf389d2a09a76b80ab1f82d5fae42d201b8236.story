The M25 could be expanded to an unprecedented 14 lanes in a tunnel underneath a third runway at Heathrow, as part of a radical new plan, it emerged yesterday.

The airport unveiled its controversial expansion proposal in a submission to the Government's aviation commission - as it battles to fend off growing competition from its rival Gatwick.

It is thought that a 600 metre, 14 lane tunnel would replace an existing part of the M25 and would pass under a third runway.

The airport claim it would be built without any disruption to the current motorway.

The Govermnent is considering three options to ease the growing pressure on London's airports.

Option one would see a third runway built at Heathrow - costing £15.6billion.

But taxpayers would be asked to spend an extra £1.2billion for a tunnel under the M25 as well as extra lanes on the motorway near the airport.

Heathrow claims the extra runway would be up and running by 2025.

A second Heathrow plan calls for an existing runway to be extended to allow more flights.

But Britain's second busiest airport, Gatwick, has urged the Government to ditch Heathrow from its plans.

It says a second runway at the airport would be cheaper - at £7.8billion - and would not need any Government subsidy.

Boris Johnson has urged the Government commission to add a giant four-runway Thames Estuary airport to its shortlist, but this is likely to be rejected.

A final recommendation on Britain's next runway will be made after the 2015 general election.

But London Mayor Boris Johnson dismissed 
both airport's plans. His chief airport adviser said Heathrow's bid was 'lunacy' 
while Gatwick's bid for a second runway was a 'humongous red herring'.

Under Heathrow's £15.6billion proposal, which needs a £1.2billion taxpayer-funded Government top up, the airport would build a third runway by 2025.

It claims the new runway would boost the UK economy by £100billion and create 100,000 jobs.

A third runway would take the number of annual flights out of Heathrow up from the current 472,000 to 740,000 - with 40 new daily routes around the world.

But to make the runway possible, a new 600 metre tunnel will be needed on the M25. The motorway will also need to be widened to seven lanes in each direction.

This would turn the motorway into a giant 14 lanes on the stretch between junctions 14 and 15 near Heathrow. 

The airport's chiefs today insisted that this work, taking three to four years to complete, could be done without having to close part of the motorway.

But a rival bid by Gatwick claims it could add a second runway for less money - and without any taxpayer top up.

The £7.8 billion Gatwick plan would see a second runway built at the West Sussex airport, creating 120,000 new jobs.

Initial plans by both airports made it onto a shortlist chosen by the Government's Airports Commission looking into the best way to boost the number of flights in and out of Britain. A final recommendation will be published in 2015 - after the next election.

Motorists are often forced to endure heavy traffic on the M25 near Heathrow Airport and could be expected to suffer further queues if a third runway is built

Also on the short list is a rival Heathrow scheme to extend the existing northern runway to at least 6,000 metres.

Gatwick bosses said its second-runway plan will allow 10 million more passengers each year to able to travel.

They also claim that it can be built about five years earlier than a third runway at Heathrow at no additional cost or risk to the taxpayer;

Far fewer people will be affected by noise as well, they claim - a second runway at Gatwick would have an impact on only 14,000 people compared with the 240,000 people impacted by noise from Heathrow today.

John Holland-Kaye, Heathrow's development director and chief executive designate, said: 'Expansion at Heathrow matters to the whole country.

Boris Johnson has campaigned against expanding Heathrow or Gatwick - in favour of a giant new four-runway hub airport in the Thames Estuary

'Only Heathrow will connect all of the UK to fast-growing international markets. The plans we are submitting to the Airports Commission demonstrate major economic benefits from a third runway for the whole of the UK.'

He added: 'Our plans are deliverable. Heathrow offers the fastest, most cost effective and practical route to connect the whole of the UK to growth and we have proven our ability to deliver a world-class hub that will make Britain proud.'

But Stewart Wingate, Gatwick's chief executive, said: 'As we reach this critical point in the aviation debate it is clear that the Airports Commission has a very real choice to make - expand Gatwick and create genuine competition in the market with lower fares for everyone, or move back to a London airport market dominated by a single player and saddle the next generation with higher air fares.

'Why would you choose to fly a quarter of a million more planes every year over one of the world's most densely populated cities when instead you can fly them mostly over fields?

'Why tunnel part of the busiest motorway in Europe - the M25 - causing serious traffic disruption, when you can build on land already set aside for expansion? The choice is an obvious one. Expand the best and only deliverable option - Gatwick - and create a market that serves everyone.'

The option of a new airport in the Thames Estuary - the so-called 'Boris Island' scheme favoured by London's Mayor Boris Johnson - did not make the shortlist drawn up by the commission which is headed by former Financial Services Authority chief Sir Howard Davies.

But the commission is still studying the scheme and is expected to make a decision later this year on whether the project should be taken forward.

Mr Johnson's chief aviation adviser Daniel Moylan said: 'It is lunacy to suggest that any plan to build a third runway will reduce noise levels at Heathrow. And their owners must think we were born yesterday if they expect us to believe they have experienced a fit of conscience that has resulted in a new commitment to the wider regions of the UK.

'A third runway will not restore the 11 regional routes axed at Heathrow since 1990 as peak slots will be dominated by the most profitable long-haul flights. Their claim to be the only deliverable plan on the table is patently untrue and their proposals to encourage more passengers to use public transport are based on false assumptions. Put simply their arguments are all hot air.'

He added: 'A new hub airport in the inner estuary could be built for the same cost as a four-runway Heathrow, and would bring new jobs, homes, and long term competitiveness to the east, while simultaneously opening up the largest potential site for new homes and jobs in London to the west.

'It is the only credible option and the only one that portrays a compelling vision for this country's claim to be the natural economic capital of Europe.'

Mr Moylan said that building a new runway at Gatwick airport was 'a humongous red herring'.
