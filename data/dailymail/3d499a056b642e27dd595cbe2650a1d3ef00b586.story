It's not just couples getting in the romantic mood for Valentine's Day today after a train firm livened up some journeys by changing the names of destinations on its departure boards.

For one day only South West Trains has offered its customers the chance to go to Waterlove, Breakfast at Twickenham, Rich (in love) Mond and Truly, Madly, Eastleigh.

The train operator, which has services in Hampshire, Surrey, Dorset, Wiltshire, Berkshire, Devon, Somerset, and Greater London, asked its customers and employees to send their suggestions.

Train company, South West Trains, got into the romantic spirit and changed its departure boards destination names including When Harry Met Salisbury

Other ideas included Romsey and Juliet, Darling Dorking, Gorgeous Guildford, Hampton Courting and Strawberries and Champagne Hill. 

Some of the carriages also had their destinations on-board changed to say 'love train' too. 

The romantic gesture has had a huge reaction on social media, with many commuters taking to Twitter to share their pictures of the signs.

Helen Trompeteler posted a picture of a sign to 'Lost in Tedington', saying: 'Thank you for giving me the giggles and reminding me of one of my favourite films! #lostintranslation'.

South West Trains renamed London Waterloo to Waterlove for one day only as part of a Valentine's Day gesture for its customers

The train operator asked customers and members of staff to come up with some romantic-themed alternatives, they included Darling Dorking and Kissington Station

Melissa Loader said: 'Put big smiles on our faces today!! Thank you South West Trains!' while Alex Dowding said the operator was 'on fire with the Valentine's Day puns'.

Another user wrote: 'Thank you for making people smile with your Valentine station names. It’s things like this that set you apart from other train lines.'

While Hayley Johnson joked: 'I think @SW_Trains missed a trick this Valentine's by not including "Feltham-up".' 

A spokeswoman for the South West Trains-Network Rail Alliance said: 'In the spirit of Valentine's Day we asked our customers and employees to suggest quirky romance-themed alternatives to our station names. 

Signs were changed to When Harry met Salisbury sign (left) and Liphook in Hampshire was changed to 'lips-hooked'. Basingstoke 'and Four weddings' and Portsmouth 'and Passionfield' was also changed (right)

'We got some great suggestions, many of which we are displaying on customer information screens across the network for today only.

'We hope those travelling with us today enjoy their journeys and have a lovely Valentine's Day.' 

But not all passengers were impressed by the romantic with send-off, with some describing it as 'a bit much' and others raising questions over the practicalities for tourists.

Dam Tay said: 'Ok, having a laugh with station names today, but what about the confusion thats created for ppl whom English is not 1st language? [sic]'.

Wonderful Woking, Beautiful Basingstoke and Hampton Courting were among other ideas to the company

But South West Trains confirmed they are 'actively monitoring this and staff are on hand to help should the need arise'.

The train firm has also invited rugby fans on their way to and from the Six Nations rugby match between England and Italy at Twickenham today to have their Valentine's messages put on a board outside the station.

It's asked lovers to tweet their message to them using the hashtag #SWValentine before 8pm
