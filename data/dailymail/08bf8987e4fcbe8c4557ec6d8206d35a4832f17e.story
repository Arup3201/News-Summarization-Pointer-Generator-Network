The victim's 9-year-old brother ran to tell a neighbor what happened, who then contacted authorities, Stanton told MailOnline.

He said that police executed a search warrant Thursday evening, and a .38 caliber semi-automatic handgun was found inside the apartment.

The gun was not inside a safe or concealed inside the apartment, Stanton told MailOnline.

'We're not quite sure where the kids got it from,' he said.

The 7-year-old boy and the 9-year-old boy are being interviewed today by investigators, Stanton told MailOnline.
