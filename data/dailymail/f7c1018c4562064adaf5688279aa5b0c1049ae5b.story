Anthony Weiner has admitted that he started three different virtual relationships with women after he resigned from Congress following his Twitter sexting scandal in 2011.

Meanwhile, the woman who released the latest slew of explicit sex messages and naked pictures has said that she was truly in love with the disgraced former Congressman during their six-month virtual affair.

Sydney Leathers, now 23, spoke out for the first time since her identity was revealed that she believed the feelings to be mutual, but now she is 'disgusted by him'.

A preview of her interview with Inside Edition was released shortly after Weiner held a press conference on Thursday afternoon where he disclosed an approximate break down of his sexting timeline, just hours after the latest poll revealed he has lost his front-runner lead in the New York City mayoral race.

New York Magazine reports
 that at a press conference on Thursday, Weiner said 'it's six to ten 
(women) I suppose' as the total number of women he has had virtual 
relationships with in his lifetime.

Dirty details: Women that he had virtual relationships with included Lisa Weiss (left) before his resignation, and Sydney Leathers (right) after

When
 asked to clarify how many of those relationships started after he 
resigned from Congress in June 2011, he said: 'I don't believe more than
 three'.

Today has not been good in terms of any 
numbers for Weiner, as the first poll since the Leathers revelation 
shows that he has been bumped out of the lead in the mayoral race.

In love: Sydney Leathers said that she was in love with Weiner, and that he told her that he loved her as well

During the Inside Edition interview, Leathers told how she was initially attracted to Weiner because of his politics but now she has seen another side of him.

'He's not who I thought he was,' she said.

She said that both she and Weiner said that they loved each other during their virtual romance, and Indiana-based Leathers has previously said that he offered to secure a condo for her in Chicago so that they could meet for trysts beyond the computer screen.

When asked what she would like to say to him now, she responded: 'Stop lying, stop embarrassing his wife, and get help.'

The renewed discussion about his sexual indiscretions was prompted by Leather's decision to release screen grabs of their conversations to gossip site The Dirty as well as pictures of his genitals, all of which were exchanged more than one year after he resigned from Congress.

His drop in the polls comes as Weiner confirmed he had virtual relationships with three women after his 2011 resignation from Congress and between six and ten similar situations prior to leaving office. 

The first poll conducted after his relationship with then-22-year-old Sydney Leather was revealed just came out Thursday afternoon and has City Council Speaker Christine Quinn leading with 25 per cent of the Democratic vote.

Weiner comes in second place with only 16 per cent- down from his earlier 26 per cent lead from a different poll that measured the public's thinking the week preceding the Tuesday revelations.

'These new revelations have cost Anthony Weiner the lead in the Democratic field,' director of Marist College polling Lee Miringoff told The Wall Street Journal, which co-sponsored the poll.

Carrying on: Anthony Weiner, seen here campaigning on Thursday, asserts that he will continue with his bid to become New York City's next mayor in spite of the latest scandal and his plummeting poll numbers

Competitors: The latest poll, conducted post scandal, says that Weiner is in second place and followed by the city's former comptroller Bill Thompson

In addition to taking away his lead, 
the release of naked photos and explicit sex chats have driven up his 
unfavorability rating, bringing him up to an 'all-time high' of 55 per 
cent.

By comparison, his unfavorables were only at 36 per cent in June.

This
 latest survey took place entirely on Wednesday, the day after the 
former Obama campaign worker shared her illicit sex chats and photos of 
Weiner's genitals with gossip site The Dirty.

Later
 that same day, the disgraced congressman and his wife Huma Abedin held a
 joint press conference declaring their dedication to both one another 
and the campaign.

The Wall Street Journal/Marist poll suggests that there is a good number of New Yorkers who agree with that decision.

Of
 the 1,199 people surveyed, 47 per cent of registered Democrats said he 
should stay in the race- which is the same number who believe he 
deserves a second chance.

That
 percentage of the electorate is just slightly bigger than the 43 per 
cent who said he should drop out. And 45 per cent of New York Democrats 
believe he does not have the character to be mayor of the country's 
largest city.

Prior to this afternoon's poll, things were still looking positive for Weiner.

The latest poll Quinnipiac University poll reveals that 
during the week leading up to the Sydney Leather scandal, Weiner came 
out on top with 26 per cent of the Democratic vote, with City Council 
Speaker Christine Quinn following with 22 per cent and former 
comptroller Bill Thompson with 20 per cent.

The
 poll may not carry the same weight now, however, as it weighed the 
opinions of voters between July 18 and July 23, and Weiner's messages to
 Sydney Leather were only made public on the 23rd.

Weiner sent an email to supporters on Wednesday, just hours after he and his wife Huma Abedin gave a joint press conference about the messages and photos, where he said that the bid for New York City's mayor was 'too important' to give up over 'embarrassing personal things'.

Trying to move the cycle: Weiner maintained that he will continue with his bid to become New York's next mayor

Rivals, newspaper editorial pages and 
former New York congressional colleagues urged the Democrat to quit 
after he acknowledged exchanging raunchy messages and photos online 
after he had resigned from Congress for similar behaviour.

Jerrold Nadler, Democratic 
representative for New York's 10th congressional district, said: 'I 
think he should pull out of the race. I think he needs serious 
psychiatric help.'

Nydia Velázquez, who was also Weiner's colleague back when he was a Democratic representative for the city, said his antics were a 'total distraction' from the real issues the mayoral campaign should be debating. 

The latest scandal erupted on Tuesday
 after the gossip website The Dirty posted X-rated messages and a crotch
 shot it said Weiner exchanged with a woman last year while using the 
online alias 'Carlos Danger'.

The New York Times cited his 'marital troubles and personal compulsions' as reasons for the 48-year-old Democrat to leave the race while The Wall Street Journal claimed he should be forced out 'simply because of what he's forced his wife to endure'.

'I love him. I have forgiven him. I believe in him': Huma Abedin read a statement at the Tuesday press conference reaffirming her belief in her husband and their marriage

Standing united: Anthony Weiner had his wife Huma Abedin at his side when he addressed the new revelations of another sexually inappropriate relationship that took place a year after he resigned

'The serially evasive Mr. Weiner 
should take his marital troubles and personal compulsions out of the 
public eye and the mayoral race,' the Times wrote.

The Daily News declared Weiner to be 
'lacking the dignity and discipline that New York deserves in a mayor," 
and said "his demons have no place in City Hall.'

At least three of his mayoral rivals,
 Bill de Blasio and Sal Albanese, both Democrats, and billionaire 
businessman John Catsimatidis, a Republican, said he should drop out.

'Anthony's presence in this race has 
become a never-ending sideshow that is distracting us from the debate of
 the serious issues of this election,' de Blasio said.

Weiner's strongest rivals in the polls, Christine Quinn and Bill Thompson, criticised him but didn't directly call on him to quit.
