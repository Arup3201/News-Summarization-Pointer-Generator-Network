A mother who five-month-old baby was crushed to death on a baggage carousel at a Spanish airport has taken her case to court.

Nathania Terry from Maryland watched in horror as her daughter Vashti Terry was killed last year at Alicante Airport.

Ms Terry is now suing Netherlands-based Industries, a global supplier of luggage handling systems for airports and parcel and postal carriers.

She is seeking punitive damages for wrongful death, negligence, design defects and failure to warn, reports Court House News.

Ms Terry had just landed in Spain in September 2013 after flying with her two children - Vashti and an older boy.

'Upon arrival in Alicante, Spain, Ms. Terry ushered her children toward the baggage claim,' the complaint states.

'Vashti was sitting in her car seat. Ms. Terry placed Vashti's car seat on a non-moving, or stationary, belt while she reached to retrieve Vashti's stroller from the end of the belt. 

The little girl was crushed in the gap, seen center, between two moving parts of the carousel

Her head reportedly became crushed between the two parts as her mother looked on helplessly

'The belt suddenly and without warning turned on, throwing Vashti into a crevice where two different conveyor belts abutted.

'Ms. Terry frantically tried to rescue Vashti, but her efforts were unsuccessful. Five-month old Vashti was crushed to death on Sept. 18, 2013.'

Ms Terry claims the conveyor belts at the airport, designed and manufactured by Vanderlande, had sensors that activated them when they detected objects.

She says that when she put her daughter's car-seat on the belt it then started and there was no way to stop the conveyor and no warning about activating sensors.

Spanish authorities said in a statement last year that the luggage carousel complied with safety standards.

In a statement, authorities insisted the machine was not to blame for the tragedy and that the luggage carousel adhered to legal standards.

It was 'not attributable to the installation [of the machine], designed for the passage of luggage and not for the movement of people... It was due to neglect of those who were in charge of the child'.
