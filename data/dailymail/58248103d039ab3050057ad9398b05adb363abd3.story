David Cameron and George Osborne decided Theresa May ‘must not be promoted’ to the Foreign Office to stifle her leadership ambitions, it has been claimed.

An official close to the Prime Minister was quoted as saying that a ‘central principle’ of the recent ministerial shake-up was that the Home Secretary must not advance further.

Mr Cameron is said to want the Chancellor to succeed him when he stands down, probably halfway through the next Parliament if he wins the next election.

But there is growing support for Mrs May, whose stock has risen even though she largely shuns the media and avoids the Westminster power games loved by many of her male colleagues.

The Home Secretary recently overtook London Mayor Boris Johnson as the activists’ favourite to become the next Conservative leader.

A poll also showed the Home Secretary is now the most popular member of the current Government.

Mrs May, who has been hailed as ‘Britain’s Angela Merkel’ by her allies, would not countenance any sort of leadership challenge to the Prime Minister, and has repeatedly stressed her loyalty to him.

However, she is understood to regard Mr Johnson as ‘faintly ridiculous’ and is determined to prevent him becoming leader if the Tories lose the next election.

Mrs May’s stock rose further following her extraordinary confrontation with police leaders earlier this year, which was hailed as one of the bravest political speeches of recent decades.

Tory MPs expressed admiration for the Home Secretary’s declaration at the Police Federation conference that a string of scandals has left the very legitimacy of British policing under threat.

Britain’s former ambassador to the US, Sir Christopher Meyer, said Mrs May had ‘echoes of Margaret Thatcher’ and had delivered ‘one of the most powerful, courageous and candid speeches by a Cabinet minister I have ever seen’.

Mrs May’s ‘untouchable’ position in the Cabinet was bolstered when former Education Secretary Michael Gove came off worst in a public clash between the two over extremism.

But although Mrs May – Britain’s longest-serving Home Secretary in more than 50 years – is said to have ambitions to become Foreign Secretary, the job was handed to former Defence Secretary Philip Hammond when William Hague decided to step aside to become leader of the Commons.

‘One of the central principles of the reshuffle was that Theresa must not be promoted,’ one official close to Mr Cameron told the Financial Times.

A minister close to Mr Hammond said he was worried he had been deployed as a ‘block’ on Mrs May.

But a senior Downing Street source said the suggestion the Prime Minister had snubbed Mrs May by giving the Foreign Office to another minister was ‘bizarre’, adding: ‘This claim is simply untrue. She is doing a brilliant job in one of the toughest and most important areas of Government. The idea she should have been moved is ridiculous.’

There were also claims that Communities Secretary Eric Pickles came ‘within a whisker’ of being sacked but Mr Cameron decided it would be ‘too much’ after demoting Mr Gove and sacking Environment Secretary Owen Paterson.  

Mr Pickles’ plight was helped by the fact he took the blame for a public row with Environment Agency boss Lord Smith during the winter floods, even though allies said Number Ten had suggested the minister attack him.
