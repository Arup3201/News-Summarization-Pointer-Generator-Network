Suspended: Breast surgeon Ian Paterson performed cleavage sparing mastectomies on hundreds of women

A cancer surgeon may have botched more than 4,500 breast operations even though colleagues had warned hospital bosses about him for years, an official report said yesterday.

But the NHS probe was described as a whitewash last night by victims because it failed to hold surgeon Ian Paterson to account.

Sir Ian Kennedy, author of the 166-page report, did not even interview Paterson, who has been suspended  and is being investigated by police.

Declaring that ‘naming and shaming’ would not solve the case, he focused instead on management errors.

A footnote says he ‘did not have the opportunity’ to speak to Paterson because the surgeon ‘may have found it difficult’.

Paterson, 56, may face charges over allegations that he convinced 450 healthy women to have operations needlessly.

He is also accused of performing experimental ‘cleavage-sparing’ mastectomies, in which tissue is left behind for cosmetic reasons, on 700 patients without their permission.

It is alleged that this may raise the risk of them developing cancer by up to 50 per cent.

Yesterday, it was revealed that a further 3,500 women who had lumpectomies and other breast operations at Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust, West Midlands, may also have had their procedures botched and could be recalled.

Up to 400 women are thought to be suing the trust and a private firm over the operations. Sir Ian said the doctor was ‘charismatic and charming’ and ‘liked by his patients’ but was not regarded as a team player.

Shirley Moroney wants Paterson to be charged with the manslaughter of her sister Marie Pinfield, who died after he gave her a cleavage-sparing operation in 2006 when others claimed she needed a double mastectomy.

A cleavage sparing mastectomy involved leaving 
behind some breast tissue to provide an improved cleavage for the 
patient.

But it breached national guidelines, which state that leaving tissue after a mastectomy increases the chances of cancer recurring - especially if the remaining breast tissue does not receive radiotherapy.

This is because a significant proportion of breast tissue is deliberately left by the surgeon in the inner aspect of the breast in order to give the patient breast cleavage - even in women not undergoing immediate reconstruction.

The technique is different to the widely-used skin sparing mastectomy, where the surgeon leaves behind an envelope of skin to improve the appearance of breast reconstruction.

Her
 cancer returned and she died two years later at 50. Mrs Moroney, 51, 
said of Sir Ian’s report: ‘It was a waste of time. He was in a part-time
 role, he had no researchers, no staff. It was a farce, a whitewash. If 
Paterson’s views have not been included, what was the point?’

Paterson
 worked at NHS and private hospitals across the Midlands from 1994 until
 he was suspended last year. He was employed by Heart of England in 
March 1998, having been suspended by another trust.

Colleagues
 became concerned that he was not removing enough tissue during 
mastectomies and two investigations were carried out, in 2003 and 2004.

Although a number of recommendations were made about his surgery, nothing was done to stop him.

Fears
 raised by a surgeon in 2007 were not properly acted upon. Paterson was 
told to stop cleavage-sparing operations but continued until as late as 
2011.

Paterson was suspended by the trust in May 2011 but his pay was not stopped for 18 months.

Sir
 Ian said: ‘This is a tragic story... of women faced with a 
life-threatening disease who have been harmed, of clinicians at their 
wits’ ends trying for years to get the trust to address what was going 
on, of secrecy and containment, of a surgeon who chose to operate on 
women in a way unrecognised by peers and thereby exposed them to harm.’

Gail Boichat was given an unnecessary mastectomy by Paterson 18 years ago, only to find out later that her breast should never have been removed

Sir Ian said that what happened at Solihull Hospital between 2003 and 2011 was a 'tragic story' that was also a story of 'secrecy and containment'

When policewoman Marie Pinfield was 
diagnosed with cancer in her left breast in 2006, she was in no doubt 
what she wanted her hospital consultant to do.

Terrified that the
 grade 3 tumour would eventually kill her, the 48-year-old requested a 
bilateral mastectomy to remove both her breasts and all trace of the 
cancer.

Breast cancer nurses showed her pictures of other women
 who'd undergone a double mastectomy so that she could make an informed 
decision about what she would look like following the loss of her 38GG 
bust.

Not once did she waver, telling her family: 'I'm scared 
my breasts will be the end of me.' She was determined to survive at all 
costs, but her words would prove to be tragically prophetic.

After
 undergoing two operations, followed by chemo and radiotherapy, Marie 
died on October 21, 2008 at the Marie Curie Hospice in Solihull, 
surrounded by family and friends after the breast cancer spread to her 
lungs. She was only 50 years old.

'I am haunted by the thought that Marie could be alive today,' her sister, Shirley Moroney, 50, told the Mail earlier this year. 'She was not only my sister but my best friend, and I miss her every day.'

Ms Pinfield's family claim she made her wishes for a double mastectomy very clear to staff at Solihull Hospital. They cannot comprehend the clinical decisions Mr Paterson made and are demanding answers.

Suspicious: Ms Moroney believes some medical staff within Solihull Hospital tried to blow the whistle about the quality of Mr Paterson's surgery long before he was suspended

Ms Moroney said her sister was devastated when she came round from her surgery because her breasts were still there. 

'When Mr Paterson arrived, I said: “Why does Marie still have breasts?” He seemed extremely put out and replied: “I know exactly what I'm doing. I have removed all the mammary glands and all she has left is fatty tissue.” He said the cancer had been removed. 'I was furious because I felt her wishes had been ignored.'

However, in a letter to lawyers acting for Shirley, the Trust has since accepted that insufficient tissue was removed on that - and a subsequent - occasion.

After undergoing two operations, followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy, Marie died on October 21, 2008

'We believe some medical staff within Solihull Hospital tried to blow the whistle about the quality of Mr Paterson's surgery long before he was suspended,' says Ms Moroney. 'It's a disgrace no action was taken sooner and so many women have since been affected.'
