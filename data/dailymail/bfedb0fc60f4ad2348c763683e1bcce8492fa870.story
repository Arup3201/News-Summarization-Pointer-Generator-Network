Over the past eight years, Apple has released a total of ten iPhones, all said to be a slight variation on the one before.

But, how much have the devices actually changed since the 2G’s 3.5-inch screen and rounded edges? 

Designers have combined models of each handset since 2007 to create a graphic that reveals the evolution of the phones as they morph in front of your eyes.

The graphic was created for California-based image search site PicClick. It plots the design changes from the first iPhone, known as the 2G in 2007, through the iPhone 3G, 3GS, 4, 4S, 5, 5S and 5C, and the most recent iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

It plots the design changes from the first iPhone, known as the 2G in 2007, through the iPhone 3G, 3GS, 4, 4S, 5, 5S and 5C, and the most recent iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

Designers compiled high-resolution 3D models of each handset, and then used image-morphing technology to create the GIFs.

Each design is visualised from the front, side and rear, and the changing sizes are also demonstrated in a picture created by the firm.

‘Critics of the Apple iPhone often say that the design and features of each new model barely change and each phone is just a slightly tweaked version of the last,’ explained PicClick.

The graphic (pictured) shows that the most noticeable change among the recent iPhone iterations is how much of the front of the device is devoted to the screen. Until the iPhone 5, the overall size of the phone remained the same. At this point, in September 2012, Apple jumped from a 3.5-inch screen to a 4-inch display

The 4-inch display remained for two years, also being used on the iPhone 5S and 5C. Last September, Apple increased this display size again, to 4.7-inches for the iPhone 6 and its first foray into phablets, with 5.5-inches on the iPhone 6 Plus. ‘As mobile video grows, Apple has expanded screens accordingly,’ said PicClick

‘We wanted to put this claim to the test.

‘With the help of image-morphing technology, we visualised the changes from three different perspectives.’

The iPhone (pictured) was released on 29 June 2007. It has a 3.5-inch, 160-pixel per inch screen

iPhone: The iPhone was released on 29 June 2007. It has a 3.5-inch display, 160-pixel per inch screen.

The phone includes, contacts, calendar, visual voice mail, SMS and quad-band GSM + Edge, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

Steve Jobs announced at the launch the software also lets people have multiple SMS messaging sessions at once.

iPhone 3G: The iPhone 3G has a plastic rear, and includes 3G, GPS, and comes in white.

iPhone 3GS: Apple’s third iPhone, the 3GS is almost identical to the 3G, but comes in silver. 

The firm added a 3MP rear camera, voice control as well as a cut, copy and paste.

iPhone 4: By the iPhone 4, Apple had redesigned the phone to feature stainless steel and glass, and it became more square than previous models.

The 4 has a front-facing camera, Retina display, FaceTime and the rear camera has been boosted to 5MP.

iPhone 4S: Design-wise, Apple’s iPhone 4S was very similar to the iPhone 4 but Apple added an 8MP camera, and support for Siri.

iPhone 5: It wasn’t until the iPhone 5 that Apple took another look at the design.

Made using aluminium, the phone has a larger screen, an 8MP camera, this time with a sapphire crystal lens, and HD FaceTime. 

The iPhone 5 was the first model to use the Lightning connector port.

iPhone 5S: In 2013, Apple broke away from its traditional release schedule and launched two phones at its September event.

The iPhone 5S is a marginal improvement on the iPhone 5, and comes in gold, black and white.

It was the first phone to feature the Touch ID sensor.

The most recent handsets, released in September, are the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus (pictured). Both have the fingerprint scanner introduced on the iPhone 5S. The iPhone 6 has a 4.7-inch display, and the iPhone 6 Plus’ is 5.5 inches. Both have Retina HD displays and both came with NFC chips for the first time

iPhone 5C: Meanwhile, the ‘budget’ iPhone 5C was launched with a plastic rear. Internally, the phone is almost identical to the iPhone 5, but it comes in a wider range of colours.

iPhone 6 and 6 Plus: The most recent handsets, released in September, are the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

Both have the fingerprint scanner introduced on the iPhone 5S.

The iPhone 6 has a 4.7-inch display, and the iPhone 6 Plus’ is 5.5 inches.

Both have Retina HD displays, a return to the more rounded edges of previous models, and both come with NFC chips for the first time.

These can be used with Apple Pay.

The camera has remained the same, but the iPhone 6 Plus additionally has optical image stabilisation. 

At this point, in September 2012, Apple jumped from a 3.5-inch screen to a 4-inch display.

The 4-inch display remained for two years, also being used on the iPhone 5S and 5C.

Last September, Apple increased this display size again, to 4.7-inches for the iPhone 6 and its first foray into phablets, with 5.5-inches on the iPhone 6 Plus.

‘As mobile consumption of video and social content grows to rival - and in some cases exceed - desktop use, Apple has expanded screens accordingly,’ continued PicClick.

The width of each handset has grown with each iteration. The first generation is 2.4inches (61mm) wide. The 3GS is 2.44 inches (62.1mm), the 4S is 2.31 inches (58.6mm), the iPhone 5C is 2.33 inches (59.2mm) and the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are 2.64 inches (67mm) and 3.06 inches (77.8mm) respectively

On all handsets, the home button has remained in the same place, but since the iPhone 5S it has doubled up as a fingerprint scanner called the TouchID sensor.

Over the past eight years, the iPhone has slimmed down significantly in nearly all its successive versions. 

The 2G is 0.46 inches (11.6mm) thick and the iPhone 4 dropped to 0.37 inches (9.3mm).

By the 5S the thickness was 0.3 inches (7.6mm), and the most recent iPhone 6 Plus is just 0.28 inches (7.1mm) - a total drop of 0.17 inches (4.5mm).

Width is a different story, however, growing with each iteration.

The first generation phone, which has since been discontinued, is 2.4inches (61mm) wide. The 3GS is 2.44 inches (62.1mm), the 4S is 2.31 inches (58.6mm), the iPhone 5C is 2.33 inches (59.2mm) and the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are 2.64 inches (67mm) and 3.06 inches (77.8mm) respectively.
