This is the heartbreaking moment young girls in Kenya are sold into arranged marriages for a dowry of livestock as part of a traditional ceremony which marks their passing into womanhood.

Clad in tribal jewellery and with their hair tied up in braids, some of the women can be seen struggling as they are hauled away, traded by their fathers for 20 goats, three camels, and ten cows.

Many of the girls, who are members of the Pokot tribe, are not aware they have been bargained away until their husbands come to collect them after spending a month in isolation before the ceremony takes place.

Struggle: A girl from the Pokot tribe in Kenya tries to escape after being sold as a bride by her parents in return for a dowry of livestock

Tradition: The girls are isolated from the village for a month before the ritual takes place meaning many are unaware they have been sold off

Harsh: One family said they had deliberately kept the arranged marriage from their daughter for fear she would run away if she found out

Payment: The livestock are paid to the girl's family over a series of weeks, with the last being brought on the day of the ritual when the men will also collect their brides

Desperate: Life is a constant struggle for the women of the Pokot tribe as the people are also known to practice female genital mutilation

Often their parents will keep the details of the marriage hidden for fear that their daughter will run away if she finds out about the deal they have made. 

As part of the ritual, which lasts a day and night, the village men will also select a bull from the herd of cows which the women will punch into submission before it is executed with a spear-thrust to the heart.

This particular ceremony took place in the bush around 30 miles (50km) from the town of Marigat in Baringo County which is home to around 133,000 plains Pokot.

Many of the girls will be as young as 14, despite Kenyan law now forbidding childhood marriage. As with many tribal customs, however, strict adherence to tradition is considered more important than complying with the law. 

Fight: A girl grips on to her parents' arms before being taken away by her new husband in Kenya as part of a tribal ceremony

Ritual: The women will remain standing for more than a day and a night during the ceremony, which also involves dancing

Make way: Men arrive in the village leading the last train of cattle as they prepare to take the wives they have bargained for home with them

Young: Child marriage has been outlawed in Kenya in an attempt to crack down on tribal practices, but many will simply ignore the law

The Pokots developed their social structure and practices in order to maximise their chances of survival of each household in an often difficult and hostile environment, but they are coming to be viewed as barbaric and unacceptable in modern-day Kenya.

During the ceremony the girls will sing and stay standing from the afternoon through out the night and the morning after. At the end of the ceremony, the girls and the boys of the community dance together, supervised by elders. 

While the images show the girls' shock and distress at what is happening to them, it is unlikely to be the first time they have suffered hardships at the hands of their parents and tribal tradition.

Brutal: As part of the ceremony the village men will also select a bull from among the cattle to be slaughtered and eaten

Beaten: However before it is killed the women are required to punch it into submission as a sign of their new strength 

Attack: Women of the Pokot tribe in Kenya beat a young bull as part of a ceremony that marks their passing into adulthood

Slaughter: After the women have weakened the cow by punching it, it is killed by the men using a single spear stab to the heart

Blessing: A Pokot man holds a lamb as he blesses more than a hundred girls during an initiation ceremony marking the girls' coming of age

The Pokot people are also known to practice female genital mutilation, a practice whereby parts of a woman's sexual organs are removed using scissors, a razor blade, or glass before they are sewn up and have their legs bound together until the wounds heal.

The tradition is carried out at a much younger age than the forced marriages, in the belief it will help to keep the girls pure until the time comes for them to undergo the ceremony that will see them become women.

However, as the ceremonies are usually carried out by unskilled quack doctors operating miles from any hospital and with no anesthetic or antibiotics, deaths are common due to blood loss or infection.

Beauty: A girl has her hair braided before it is filled with beads as part of a beauty regime before she takes part in the ritual

Alone: The girls are isolated for more than a month in dark tents before they are handed over to their new husbands as they become women

Decoration: A Pokot girl has her face smeared with white paint, beads put into her hair, and braids made using a mixture of dirt and oil

On your feet: The ceremony lasts a day and night, and the women will stay standing for the whole of it before dancing with the men

Dancing: Pokot girls and boys dance together during an initiation ceremony of over a hundred girls passing over into womanhood

If the girls do not die, then the stitches can cause them terrible pain and discomfort for the rest of their lives, especially during childbirth.

As with child marriage, the practice has now been outlawed in Kenya, with a maximum penalty of life in jail if a girl dies, but so far there have been no successful prosecutions.

Between Kenya and Uganda there are around 700,000 native Pokot speakers, with the vast majority living in West Pokot county.

Pokot society is largely divided in two between the hills Pokot, who live in rainy uplands and are mostly farmers, and the plains Pokot, who roam the dry lowlands and are mostly cattle herders.
