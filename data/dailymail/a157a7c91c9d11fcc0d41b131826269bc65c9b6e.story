Knowing that he wouldn't be there for her wedding, a terminally ill father walked his 11-year-old down the 'aisle' years early with the pastor sweetly pronouncing them 'daddy and daughter'.

Jim Zetz, 62, from Murrieta, California, who has stage 4 pancreatic cancer, proudly held his daughter, Josie's hand during their backyard ceremony on March 14 and placed a sparkling ring on her index finger.

The tear-jerking event was staged by photographer Lindsey Villatoro, who heard about the Zetz's heartbreaking story and decided to do something out of the ordinary for their final days together.

Proud dad: Knowing that he wouldn't be there for her wedding, Jim Zetz, who has stage 4 pancreatic cancer, walked his 11-year-old daughter Josie down the 'aisle' years early

In just 72 hours she went about getting financial contributions from the local community, and secured a wedding cake, dress, catering, flowers and even hair and make-up free-of-charge.

'One day [you] wake up and realize you’re
 given the opportunity to change someone’s life for the better.

'You get 
an idea, don’t think twice and run with it,' Mr Villatoro wrote in a 
description of a video slideshow she made from the event and uploaded to Vimeo.

Emotional: The event took place in the family's backyard in California with friends and family present

Cherished memories: Mr Zetz placed a sparkling ring on Josie's index finger

Last minute: The tear-jerking event was staged by photographer Lindsey Villatoro, who heard about the Zetz's heartbreaking story - she managed to get everything, including the wedding cake and outfits, donated

In keeping with tradition: There was even a gift table at the wedding ceremony

Ms Villatoro first met Josie and her father when she photographed them, along with Josie’s mother, Grace, for one of their final family portraits together.

Mrs Zetz mentioned that Josie was upset about the fact her father would not be there for 'memories down the line' so Ms Villatoro decided to try and help out.

She suggested holding a 'mini-wedding' for Josie to coincide with her 11th birthday and got the go-head.

Friends and family rallied around in support, as did complete strangers.

For her 'wedding' Josie wore an elegant long, lacy white dress and carried a pink-and-white bouquet. Soft waves were put in her long brown hair and beauticians applied natural make-up.

Her father meanwhile opted for a smart camel-colored three-piece suit, topped with a flat cap.

'Your dad may not get to see you get married, but he is here to walk you down the aisle today,' said Gary Galbraith, the pastor, according to The Press Enterprise.

After their ceremony Josie and Mr Zetz shared a quiet moment together, before returning to join the 'reception'.

In one of Ms Villatoro’s photographs Josie is seen being kissed on her cheeks by her mother and father with tears streaming down. But along with tears there were also lots of smiles, as the pictures show.

'Down the road, this will mean a lot to [Josie],' Mr Zetz said. 'She will always remember it.'

Mr Villatoro said that it was an 'honor' helping the Zetzes.

'Josie, you will forever have a video of you and your dad walking you down the aisle to play at your wedding in years to come, as if he was physically there,' she wrote.
