An FBI source who met with Osama bin Laden in 1993 was later killed by al Qaeda operatives who suspected his dissent

An FBI mole who met with Osama bin Laden was later killed by al Qaeda who suspected he was a U.S. informant.

At the time of his death in Bosnia around 1994 or 1995, the mole, who was originally from Sudan, had been working for the CIA after being tempted by a large amount of money.

The existence of the mole and his close contact with bin Laden came to light in newly-released court documents.

Intel from the meeting between the informant and bin Laden led to the FBI thwarting a terrorist attack 
on a British cruise liner and another on a masonic lodge in Los Angeles.

According to NBC News, the FBI recruited the mole in 1993 when he was the driver and close confidant of the 'blind sheik' Omar Abdel-Rahman - the mastermind behind the 1993 World Trade Center attack.

In early 1993, after being tipped off by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the FBI found the Sudanese driver on a terrorism watch list.

Following the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center - where explosives detonated in an underground parking garage killing six people -  the FBI began to watch the Sheikh, who was living in Los Angeles, but needed a way to get closer.

After failed attempts to deport the driver, the FBI turned him into a source using Bassem Youssef, a high-ranking agent and Arabic speaker.

Youssef initally approached the Sudanese driver under the guise of a friend who could help reunite him with his family, according to the NBC report.

Soon the FBI had tapped the phones in the driver's home and were working on his wife to have her cooperate.

When the driver learned the truth, he decided to cooperate and began providing information on a group known as al Qaeda.

The mole provided authentic U.S. and Canadian passports where the pictures had been cut out and replaced with al Qaeda members, allowing them to travel freely.

The FBI informant was also able to arrange a meeting in 1993 with a shadowy, little-known terrorist called Osama bin Laden.

According to NBC, the mole told the FBI that the blind sheikh said: 'If you need any money, you go to Osama directly and tell him I sent you.'

The informant's crucial information sparked the interest of the CIA who convinced the Sudanese driver to come work with them for financial reward.

Around 1994, the mole was sent to Bosnia to gain information on al Qaeda operatives who were supporting Bosnia's Muslim majority against the Serbs.

His handler Youssef had no idea what had happened to the driver. Later, the FBI agent, who had gone undercover among terrorists cells in LA, found out that al Qaeda had killed the driver because they believed him to be a CIA mole. 

The previously-unknown meeting between an FBI mole and bin Laden came to 
light when Youssef filed a 
discrimination lawsuit against the agency.

The Washington Times reported that former FBI official Edward Curran testified on Youssef's behalf in the 2010 case and told of the agent's successes at the bureau.

News of the FBI's source 
meeting with bin Laden comes in direct contrast to previous testimony 
that was used as the 'accepted' timeline of events leading up to the 
9/11 attacks.

The 9/11 
Commission Report described the FBI's intelligence on bin Laden at the 
time as being 'at best cloudy' and made no mention of a source who had 
direct contact with the terrorist.

The former head of the 9/11 Commission 
argues that the source was not directly related to the plot against the 
World Trade Center as his information came six years earlier. 

Youssef filed a discrimination suit against the bureau saying that he was sidelined after September 11 because his colleagues assumed he was an Arab Muslim. The highly-decorated agent is a Coptic Christian.

Youssef continues to work for the FBI while pursuing his discrimination case.
