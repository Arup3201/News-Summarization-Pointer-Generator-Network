Surveillance video captures the dramatic moment a former biotech executive allegedly broke into his brother-in-law's home and shot him.

Hans Petersen is seen tussling with Ron Fletcher, one of two men he is accused of shooting, as the victim tries to stop him from reaching a gun.

The dramatic scenes were shown to a San Diego court this week, as Petersen, 49, faces trial for attempted murder.

At a preliminary hearing on Monday, Mr Fletcher told the court how he tried to fight off Petersen after being shot in the abdomen as he got ready for work on September 18 last year. 

Petersen, who was going through a bitter 
divorce with Mr Fletcher's sister, Bonnie, allegedly smashed his way 
into the house through a window.

According to court documents seen by ABC News, Petersen's estranged wife said he 'went into an emotional tailspin and a depression' after losing 
his job.

She also claimed 
Petersen's behavior had changed when he stopped taking medication that 
had been prescribed after a skydiving accident.

The video appears to show Petersen walk through the house while holding a gun, after breaking in.

Mr Fletcher told the court 'I was fighting for my life' as he recounted how he managed to grab the gun after Petersen shot him.

'I tackled him to the ground and fought with him,' Mr Fletcher, whose children were at home at the time of the shooting, told the court. He claimed Petersen was yelling at him to open his safe.

The footage shows Mr Fletcher clutching his stomach with one hand and hanging on to a handgun with the other as Petersen lunges repeatedly at him.

At one point Petersen is seen appearing to smash Mr Fletcher's cell phone to prevent him calling the police.

Petersen appeared to continue to yell and try to grab the gun from Mr Fletcher, who by this point had slumped on a sofa.

The confrontation stopped only when police arrived, at which point Petersen is seen holding his hands high above his head as Mr Fletcher holds up his shirt to show officers that he is wounded.

Petersen is also accused of breaking into the home of Steven Dowdy, a former business associate, and shooting at him earlier that day.

'I realized then that this is not merely a robbery, but this is someone trying to assassinate me,' Mr Dowdy told the court.

He was shot in the back after Petersen allegedly fired into the bedroom where Mr Dowdy and his wife were sleeping.

The
 53-year-old said Petersen blamed him for losing his job in September 
2010, and testified that he had sent several emails that 'progressively 
got more disturbing', NBC San Diego reported.

Petersen, who faces up to 96 years in prison if convicted, has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
