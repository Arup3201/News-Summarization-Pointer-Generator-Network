A Perth man has escaped the death penalty for a second time after a Malaysian court rejected an appeal against his acquittal on drugs charges.

Dominic Bird, 34, was accused of supplying 167 grams of methamphetamine to an undercover police officer in March 2012

He was acquitted on September 4 last year, but was re-arrested minutes before he was about to board a flight home to Australia from Kuala Lumpur airport after prosecutors launched an 11th hour appeal.

Dominic Bird has escaped the death penalty for the second time since 2012, over drug charges in Malaysia

Possessing more than 50 grams carries a mandatory death penalty in Malaysia.

Mr Bird was freed on Wednesday afternoon as he fronted the Malaysian Court of Appeal.

He claimed he was set up by a police officer who planted the substance on him, drug squad detective Luther Nurjib.

There is still a chance prosecutors may launch one more appeal.

Mr Bird said earlier on Wednesday he was prepared for that prospect.

'I'm remaining optimistic about the result, I think we'll do well,' he told AAP.

'I've prepared myself for the DPP (Department of Public Prosecutions) appealing again, so that's still an option they can exercise.'

Before the court's decision, Mr Bird said he would try to leave for Australian immediately if the prosecution's appeal was rejected.

His lawyer, Muhammed Shafee Abdullah, in earlier hearings had argued that the arrest at the boarding gate at Malaysia's international airport was unconstitutional on the grounds his client had been declared by the Kuala Lumpur High Court to be a free man.

But Court of Appeal Justice Azahar Mohamed rejected that argument, and ruled the arrest was lawful, and that the appeal was simply a continuation of the trial.

Mr Bird, having already spent more than 18 months behind bars, was granted bail pending the outcome of the appeal.

He was accused of possessing 167 grams of the illegal substance while at a cafe near his home in Kualar Lumpur.

Prosecutor Awang Armadajaya told AAP he would consult with his superiors at the Attorney-General's office about whether or not to pursue Mr Bird.

The prosecution has 14 days to appeal, and Mr Awang said he may seek an injunction to prevent Mr Bird from leaving Malaysia while the Attorney-General's office considers its options.

In a unanimous decision, the panel of three judges ruled that the trial judge had not erred in throwing out the testimony of Inspector Luther, and that the defence had presented enough reasonable doubt to warrant acquittal.

Justice Aziah Ali, the chairwoman of the panel of three judges, said that it was clear from the High Court judge's earlier ruling that he had found Inspector Luther to be completely unreliable as a witness.

'That's the difficulty for you because your witness on whose evidence the case of the prosecution lies has been found to be not credible - a liar,' Justice Aziah said in an address to the prosecutor.

Also at question was whether it was Inspector Luther or Mr Bird who had arrived at the cafe carrying a bag that contained the drugs, after two witnesses at trial gave contradictory testimony.
