Nazeem and Rashma Khan have crossed India in a desperate search to find their three-year-old daughter.

Little Tyaba was with her parents at a family friend's wedding reception in Delhi when she disappeared.

Since then, her devoted parents have searched adoption homes, red light districts and orphanages in all of India's major cities but hope is fading.

Their loss is shared by thousands of families, whose children simply vanished.

Their stories have formed a 
project by photographer Mansi Thapliyal, who met families of missing
 children to highlight the issue in the country.

This year alone 725 children in Delhi
 have been reported missing and are untraced, according to data from 
India's Zonal Integrated Police Network website.

Children's and women's rights have 
been unprecedented focus in India in recent months, since a Delhi 
student died in December after being gang-raped on a public bus.

Her death sparked furious protests in
 the country and cases of child abuse and child rape have since been 
given greater attention.

In the latest shocking incident, a 20-year-old man has been arrested in Delhi on suspicion of raping a four-year-old girl. 

A neighbour found the girl, who was home alone, crying after the alleged attack.

She was taken to hospital where she was described as being in a stable condition.

It comes after a five-year-old girl died after being gang-raped in Madhya Pradesh.

Reuters photo-journalist Thapliyal said the project was inspired by the crime and she wanted to investigate the affect such disappearances have on the families that are left behind.

She said: 'Nothing 
can surpass the agony and desperation that has become their lives. The 
haunted looks on their faces speak of pain which is beyond all 
comprehension.

'I’m not sure if my pictures will bring these missing 
daughters back to their parents, but maybe they’ll make people stop and 
think about the next time they see a girl begging on the side of the 
street or a young maid working inside a home.

'It’s
 time to stop being silent spectators and take steps in the right 
direction or else who knows if the nightmare might come knocking on our 
doors.'

Among the seemingly endless list of 
names of missing children are Atika, 10, who disappeared in August 2008 
after going to use a communal toilet close to her house.

Her mother is still making a 'bistra'
 - a bedsheet given to Muslim brides on their wedding day - for her 
daughter in the hope she will come home.

Ambika, 15, has not been seen since October 10, 2010, when her mother awoke to find her daughter had vanished from her bed.

NGO Bachpan Bachao Andolan said about 65 per cent of children that go missing are girls, according to Thapliyal's research.

Most of those are taken and forced into the sex trade or trafficked to work as domestic workers.

Most families are too poor to search for their children themselves.

They rely on the police, who have 
been accused of corruption and heavily criticised in the recent rape 
cases that have shocked India.

Mamta's family, who earn just $4 a 
day, are relying on NGOs to try to find their daughter Bharti, who 
disappeared in April this year from near their home.

The photographer said: 'For four 
days, I met parents of girls who had gone missing. Every story was 
different, every story was equally sad.

''I spent hours with them, listening 
to their harrowing tales, understanding the grief and misery these 
families were going through. Only then did I turn my camera on to take 
pictures.

'Despite retelling their stories 
again and again over many years to hundreds of people, the mothers I met
 still cried their eyes out for their missing daughters when they spoke 
to me.'
