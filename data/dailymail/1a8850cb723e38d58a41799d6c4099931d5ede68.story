ZOOM: HOW EVERYTHING MOVES by Bob Berman (Oneworld £8.99)

Aristarchus, some 1,800 years before Copernicus (pictured), suggested that the Earth moves around the sun

Did you hear the one about the theoretical physicist who was pulled over for speeding on the motorway? He explained to the policeman that, as Einstein had shown, all motion is relative and thus, from his own point of reference, he wasn’t even moving. So the policeman gave him a parking ticket.

Of course, simply because motion is relative — an idea that Galileo first articulated 300 years before Einstein — is not to say it doesn’t exist. And Bob Berman’s Zoom is an absorbing account of how motion is everywhere around us, and nothing in the universe is motionless.

The pre-Socratic philosopher Heraclitus, who is said to have declared ‘Everything flows’, doesn’t get a look-in, but the reader is treated to a breezy narrative of scientists’ discoveries that things we once thought were static — even, it turns out, the magnetic poles — are actually in constant flux.

Everything with temperature has motion. Until the 1960s, Berman tells us, physicists had thought that, if thermometers were placed sufficiently far from any stars, they could give a reading of absolute zero on the Kelvin scale.

But they now know that the heat of the Big Bang is spread across the cosmos — although the universe is actually getting colder; it was twice as warm 8 billion years ago.

Berman, an astronomer who has written a number of successful popular science titles, takes us on a journey in two senses. First is the book’s trajectory, moving from the cosmic through to the global (explaining phenomena such as the tectonic shifts of the continents, why Everest is getting taller, and why jet streams mean that a coast-to-coast flight in the U.S. uses 20 per cent less fuel going eastwards than westwards), and on to life forms (some bacteria move 100 times their body length in a second, you could outrun a mosquito but not a dragonfly, and your lymph fluids move at about a quarter of an inch a minute).

We then head to more mind-stretching territory again, with quantum mechanics and discussion of the current scientific consensus that ‘particles and photons — matter and energy — apparently transmit knowledge across the entire universe instantly’.

The second journey is a literal one, as Berman travels around the world to research the information for his book and to talk to leading scientists in their respective fields. He makes a trip to the Atacama Desert to visit the Carnegie-funded observatory in Chile, where the night sky is dark enough to gather the light from galaxies 8 billion light-years away.

In an era in which scientists continue to hope for a ‘theory of everything’, an all-encompassing description of the universe that is profound and yet so concise it could fit as a slogan on a T-shirt, Berman offers us an ad hoc stand-in

There’s a trek to the equator to explore the Coriolis effect and a stay in Alaska to find out about the formation of snowflakes and the permutations of ice flows. Our peripatetic researcher even travels to the Greek island of Samos, where he garners material for just a footnote about Aristarchus, who, some 1,800 years before Copernicus, suggested that the Earth moves around the sun.

In an era in which scientists continue to hope for a ‘theory of everything’, an all-encompassing description of the universe that is profound and yet so concise it could fit as a slogan on a T-shirt, Berman offers us an ad hoc stand-in — albeit the same as Heraclitus: ‘Stuff moves.’
