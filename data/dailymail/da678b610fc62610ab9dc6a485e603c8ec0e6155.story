Samir Nasri was lucky to be on the pitch at half-time after a clear red-card kick on Barcelona’s Neymar.

Italian referee Gianluca Rocchi settled for giving the Frenchman a yellow card in the 38th minute, when Nasri lashed out with his right boot at the Brazilian.

Nasri had been hustled off the ball and his kick — an act of clear frustration with Manchester City being outplayed — left Neymar writhing in agony.

Nasri was the fourth City player to be yellow-carded at that stage. 

Earlier fouls had brought bookings for Fernandinho, Aleksandar Kolarov and David Silva inside 26 minutes. 

Silva’s tackle on Lionel Messi on the edge of the City box was a certain yellow card offence, despite the Spaniard claiming he had won the ball first.

David Silva claimed he won the ball, but his tackle on Lionel Messi was a clear yellow-card offence 

The Spaniard was furious as the referee cautioned him following the first-half tackle at the Nou Camp 

Silva's protest in the face of the referee was out of line considering it was a clear foul on Messi 

Silva’s aggressive protest in the face of the Italian referee was well over the top, as replays showed it was a clear foul.

I believe Rocchi got it wrong when he awarded City a penalty for a trip on Sergio Aguero late on. Justice was done when Aguero’s kick was saved.
