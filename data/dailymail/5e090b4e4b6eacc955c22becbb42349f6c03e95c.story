An Australian woman who contracted a life-threatening infection after a breast implant procedure at a Thai hospital, later requiring a partial double mastectomy, said she was 'butchered' by cosmetic surgeons. 

Ms O'Keefe chose a $7,500 cosmetic surgery tourism package  as a reward to herself after losing 35kg and her breasts appearing 'like pancakes'. 

She said she was told she was going to have 'the best time of her life'. But Ms O'Keefe said she was shocked at the result of the operation. 

'I've been absolutely butchered,' she said.

Ordeal: Courtney O'Keefe (pictured) contracted a life-threatening infection after a breast implant procedure at a Thai hospital, later requiring a double mastectomy, said she was 'butchered' by cosmetic surgeons.

Ms O'Keefe said she was in 'agony' upon returning to Australia and her mother whisked her to hospital shortly after she arrived back home in Perth. 

'We went straight to Armidale Emergency,' she said. 'I was there for 5 minutes and she admitted me up to a room. 

'I was in an isolation room becaues they didnt have any clue what I had... They swabbed, and it took four days to figure out what it was.'

It was the beginning of a six month ordeal, with Ms O'Keefe spending time at both Armidale and Fremantle hospitals. 

She was diagnosed with the rare bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa, which the Centre for Disease Control said is often contracted by patients in hospital, particularly those with wounds from surgery or hooked up to medical devices.

Her condition worsened. 'It was also turning septic and was starting to shut down my liver, my kidneys, my heart, my brain,' she said. 

'Mum and Dad had to come and say goodbye to me twice,' said Ms O'Keefe. 

Doctors called in respected specialists to treat the condition, and they concocted a special substance to fight it. 

A PIC (peripherally inserted central catheter) was installed inside her so she could receive a constant stream of antibiotics. 

On December 17, 2014, nearly a year after her ordeal, surgeons removed her implants because the infection had returned. 

Because the infection had spread to her surrounding tissue, both her breasts were also removed.

But her ordeal is not completely over. Ms O'Keefe has suffered kidney and liver problems because of the medication required to treat her infection.

She told Daily Mail Australia she had coughed up blood and that doctors said she may require surgery if she does not improve. 

She lost her job and has not worked since the ordeal began. She had to move back in with her mother. And she's devastated. 'I'm never going to live a normal life,' she said. 

Ms O'Keefe urged Australians examining plastic surgery overseas to reconsider.  

'Someone said it to me a couple of weeks ago. If you wouldn't drink the water there why the hell would you have surgery there. That's so true. So true.' 

Ms O'Keefe will undergo reconstructive surgery at the Cosmetic Institute in Sydney.
