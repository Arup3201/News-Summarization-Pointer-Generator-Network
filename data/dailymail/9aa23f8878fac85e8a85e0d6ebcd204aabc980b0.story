A mother is desperately trying to find out why her 11-year-old has ballooned to 400lbs.

Earlene Johnson from Kansas City, Missouri, told Fox4 News that medical experts have not been able to say what is behind her daughter, Falica's extreme weight gain and that one doctor believes the blame lies with her.

But she insists that blood tests show good glucose and cholesterol levels, indicating a healthy diet, and she has tried in vain to stop her child from becoming obese.

Mystery: Earlene Johnson (left) from Kansas City, Missouri, is desperately trying to find out why her 11-year-old daughter Falica has ballooned to 400lbs - so far doctors have been unable to come up with a diagnosis

'We exercise everyday. We’ve been in nutrition classes every since 2007,' she explained.

In
September 2012, Falica’s primary care doctor apparently referred her to a children's hospital in Missouri in an attempt to get a diagnosis.

However, Ms Johnson claims that instead of getting help she encountered prejudice.

'They 
would not do any blood work, they wouldn’t do any X-rays, they wouldn’t 
do any testing on my daughter,' the frustrated mom said.

Hunting for an answer: Ms Johnson insists that blood tests show good glucose and cholesterol levels, indicating her daughter has a healthy diet

'They were saying that they believe that 
she overeats and that I can stop it. Basically they were telling me that it was my fault.

'Everyone should have proper medical care regardless if you’re white, black, purple, pink, red or whatever.'

Ms Johnson
said that she was instructed to follow up with the nutrition clinic. But after making
an appointment she received a surprise visit from Child Services.

'The
next day, when I got home, the State of Missouri and Child Services was
at my house,' she recalled.

Fitness regime: The mother and daughter visit their local park everyday for a gentle workout

No action was taken and Ms  Johnson and her daughter are still looking for what’s causing the dangerous weight gain.

Ms Johnson says that she takes Falica to the local park everyday for stretching sessions. At the adventure playground they use the slide steps to do gentle step-ups and take long walks.

Falica is now attending a program at the Healthy Hawks program at the University of Kansas Medical Center Department of Pediatrics, which helps children and their families.

To date, she has already lost ten pounds.
