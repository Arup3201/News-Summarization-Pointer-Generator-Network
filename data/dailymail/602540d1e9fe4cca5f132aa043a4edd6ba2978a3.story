Dunga has begun his second reign as coach of the Brazilian national team by axing 13 players who featured at their home World Cup. 

Philippe Coutinho is one man who has been recalled to the set-up after some dazzling displays at Liverpool, while Neymar has recovered from a back injury that so cruelly ruled him out of this summer's tournament.

The 22-man squad was named on Tuesday for the friendlies against Colombia and Ecuador.

Goalkeepers: Jefferson (Botafogo), Rafael (Napoli)

Defenders: Maicon (AS Roma), Filipe Luis (Chelsea), Alex Sandro (FC Porto), Danilo (FC Porto), David Luiz (Paris Saint-Germain), Marquinhos (Paris Saint-Germain), Gil (Corinthians), Miranda (Atletico Madrid)

Midfielders: Fernandinho (Manchester City), Luiz Gustavo (VfL Wolfsburg), Elias (Corinthians), Ramires (Chelsea), Everton Ribeiro (Cruzeiro), Ricardo Goulart (Cruzeiro), Oscar (Chelsea), Willian (Chelsea), Philippe Coutinho (Liverpool)

Attackers: Hulk (Zenit St Petersburg), Neymar (FC Barcelona), Diego Tardelli (Atletico Mineiro)

QPR goalkeeper Julio Cesar, Barcelona right-back Dani Alves, Real Madrid's Marcelo and Tottenham midfielder Paulinho are amongst the biggest omissions from the squad, while captain Thiago Silva misses out through injury.

Dunga replaced Luiz Felipe Scolari at the helm following an embarrassing ending to their World Cup campaign.

The Brazilians were beaten 7-1 by eventual winners Germany in the semi-final, while they also lost out in the third-place play-off at the hands of Holland.
