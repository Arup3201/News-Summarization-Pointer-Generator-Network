The bereft widower of Lynda Bellingham decorated his hotel tree with OXO cubes in a touching tribute to his wife, after flying to Dubai because he cannot spend Christmas here without her.

Michael Pattemore went abroad for the festive period because he could not bear to be at home without the 66-year-old, who died from cancer in October. 

Tonight, Lynda's famous 1984 OXO Christmas advert was screened on ITV after Coronation Street in another poignant tribute to the 'OXO mum'.

The 59-year-old tweeted that he was hanging the cubes on the tree in tribute to his 'gorgeous wife'

It comes as her book, There's Something I've been Dying To Tell You, topped the best-seller list for Christmas, after nine weeks at number one.

In a tweet from Dubai, Mr Pattemore - whom Lynda described as her 'rock' - wrote:  'Hi everyone, hear I am in Dubai I have hung the OXO cubes on the hotel Christmas tree in memory of my gorgeous wife xx'. 

Mr Pattemore had previously travelled to Dubai with Lynda nine years ago, when she surprised him with a trip there for his 50th birthday. 

After his wife's death, Mr Pattemore told how he wanted to return to the middle east this Christmas in a bid to bring back happy memories, rather than being at home alone without her. 

Tonight, Lynda's best-known OXO advert from 1984 was aired on ITV after Coronation Street in a touching tribute to the TV star

Mr Pattemore posted a second photo of the tree, which was adorned with the stock cubes advertised by Lynda. She died in October after a year-long battle with colon cancer

In a tweet from his hotel, the 59-year-old posted a picture of the tree, saying: 'People are walking around and think we are mad !!!!! Merry Christmas to you all and thank for making Lynda No 1 xxx.'

He then posted to say: 'Hope you all enjoy the commercial tonight Lynda is with us all love Michael xxxx' 

Lynda's most famous role in the OXO adverts kept her on British TV screens for almost two decades. 

She also presented a number of TV shows and took part in the 2009 series of Strictly Come Dancing.

Michael, who has been described as Lynda's 'rock', flew to Dubai to recreate memories from his 50th birthday, when Lynda took him there as a surprise

He previously told how he could not bear to be in the UK for his first Christmas with his beloved wife, who was known as the 'OXO mum' 

Before Lynda's death, the Loose Woman star had revealed plans to end her chemotherapy but said she hoped to spend one last Christmas with her family. 

She fought her cancer in the open, appearing on television and radio talking about her illness and her decision to stop her treatment. 

The actress and presenter insisted death should be confronted and discussed and made it her mission to transform it into a 'positive' thing. 

Lynda (pictured, left, in 1976 when she appeared in 'Yus My Dear') was known for a host of TV roles, including being a contestant in the 2009 series of Strictly Come Dancing (right)

Writing in The Mail on Sunday, she said: ‘I would love to make one more Christmas, if possible, but I want to stop taking chemo around November in order to pass away by the end of January.'

She also appeared on Loose Women to talk about her decision to end treatment. 

But she died, in her husband's arms, just 11 days after the television appearance. The cancer had also spread to her lungs and liver.

Her death was met with an extraordinary outpouring of grief from the celebrity and acting world. 

Since Lynda's death from bowel cancer, Mr Pattemore has been raising money for her oncologist Professor Justin Stebbing's charity Action Against Cancer.
