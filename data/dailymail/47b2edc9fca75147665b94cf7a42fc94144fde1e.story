Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina wants to end his career in his native Spain as the uncertainty over his future persists.

Reina is training with the Reds squad in America after finishing his loan deal at Napoli.

The Rafael Benitez-managed Serie A club are interested in a permanent deal, but are refusing to meet the Â£3.95million release clause in his contract.

Reina's preferred destination would be Spain, but the former Barcelona stopper accepts he will have to wait for an opportunity in the Primera Division to arise.

'I have a contract to respect with Liverpool. I'm training well and I am perfectly fine with my team-mates,' the 31-year-old Reina told Cadena Ser.

'I am here to stay. I have not talked to Brendan Rodgers, I've been here for only four days and I am just thinking of training to my best and getting back into shape.

'At the moment all the big Spanish teams are covered in my role, so I see it as very difficult to return to Spain.

'It's normal though that over the years you want to return to where you came from, so we'll see.

'When Rafa Benitez signed me at Liverpool in 2005, I accepted and said that I would be back a little later in Spain. He replied: "We'll see".

'It's amazing that 10 years later I am still away from Spain and that it was he who brought me to Napoli last year.'
