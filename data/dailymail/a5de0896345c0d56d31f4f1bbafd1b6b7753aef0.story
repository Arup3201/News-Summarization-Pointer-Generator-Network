Eyes have now joined the long list of objects that can be printed in 3D, thanks to the ingenuity of British designers.

London-based Fripp Design and Research collaborated with Manchester Metropolitan University to produce prosthetic eyes that are barely distinguishable from the real thing.

What’s more, they can produce around 150 in an hour at a fraction of the cost of eyes made by hand, the method currently used to craft them.

Hand-painted eyes take a very long time to produce and cost around £3,000 each.

Fripp Design can make them for £100 a go. It also prints flexible facial prosthetics to support the eye.

Lewis Green, who helped to engineer the process, said: ‘We digitally create the eye image and overlay it onto a 3D form. It’s unique.’

Work in progress: The printed eyes are incredibly realistic but haven't quite been perfected yet

The hand-crafting method is so time-consuming that patients often wait weeks for an eye.

‘We can hit a button and print it,’ added Mr Green.

The technique for making an eye ready for use hasn’t quite been perfected, but Fripp Design hope to sell them in the next 12 months.

Owner Tom Fripp told Dezeen: ‘The technicality in customising an iris is very demanding and although we haven't perfected it yet, we are working on it!'
