Italian captain Francesco Schettino returned to the stricken Costa Concordia for the first time since he jumped ship two years ago in a tragedy that claimed 32 lives.

Wearing a leather jacket and sunglasses, the disgraced captain fought off a media scrum as he arrived in the tiny port on Giglio Island, donned a life jacket and got on a boat that took him out to the vessel.

Schettino's visit was part of a court-ordered inspection in the ongoing trial against him for multiple counts of manslaughter and abandoning ship before all the passengers had been evacuated.

Looking for clues: Captain Schettino stands aboard the Costa Concordia, and appears to point something out to the team with him

Gathering evidence: The court granted special dispensation for Schettino to attend after a request by his lawyers but specified he was there 'as a defendant, not a consultant'

His lawyers asked the court in 
Grosseto to authorise the search to determine if any factors beyond 
human error contributed to the disaster.

After searching the bridge and lifts last month, experts will examine the emergency generators today.

'They
 want to show that I am weak, just like two years ago. It's not true! I 
want to show I'm a gentleman, not a coward,' Schettino, who was dubbed 
'Captain Coward' by the tabloids, was quoted by Italian media as saying.

Schettino
 claims he fell onto a lifeboat as the ship keeled over on the night of 
the disaster on January 13, 2012 and then stayed on dry land because he 
wanted to co-ordinate the nighttime evacuation from there.

In a recorded phone call from that 
dramatic night, a senior coast guard official was heard shouting at 
Schettino: 'Get back on board, for f***'s sake!'

With
 4,229 people from 70 countries on board, the giant luxury liner crashed
 into rocks just off Giglio as it allegedly attempted a risky 'salute' 
manoeuvre.

It capsized near 
the coast but has since been righted in the biggest-ever salvage 
operation of its kind and is due to be towed away for scrapping in June.

Schettino
 returned to the island on Tuesday for the first time since that night 
and had been hiding from the media glare in a white-painted house on a 
cobbled side street near the port in a picturesque fishing community 
that numbers only a few hundred people.

Guarded: Schettino attended a two-hour safety briefing at a local hotel. before returning to the ship

Anger: The former captain of the Costa Concordia faced an angry mob, with one local shouting: 'Drown yourself'

Before boarding the Concordia, Schettino attended a two-hour safety briefing at a local hotel.

As he emerged he refused to answer questions from waiting journalists, saying only: 'Get out of the way.'

TV footage showed the chaotic scenes and one local could be heard shouting at him in Italian: 'Drown yourself.'

Islanders
 reacted with mixed emotions to his presence, with some saying they felt
 sympathy for someone they consider a 'scapegoat' for wider blame and 
others saying he and the ship should get off the island.

Anxious: Captain Schettino talks on the phone as he waits to board the wreck of the Costa Concordia

Sergio Ortelli, the mayor of Giglio, 
said there was 'indifference' to Schettino's visit and more concern 
about when the luxury liner would be taken away.

'What marked this island more was when he got off that boat on the night of the accident,' Ortelli said.

'When
 the spotlights are turned on, the pain of this event returns. The 
relatives of the victims and the people of Giglio need an explanation of
 what happened.'

But the 
mayor added: 'More than his two-day presence, we are interested in the 
two-year salvage of the ship, which we hope will finish as soon as 
possible.'

'This island wants to return to normality, to tourism' - a major earner in the summer months, he said.

Media scrum: Schettino arrives for a briefing prior to boarding the wreck of the Costa Concordia

Defence: Schettino claims he fell onto a lifeboat as the ship keeled over and then stayed on dry land because he wanted to co-ordinate the nighttime evacuation from there

Thursday's technical inspection will 
focus on a lift where several of the victims died and an emergency 
diesel generator which the defence says malfunctioned on the night of 
the disaster on January 13, 2012.

The
 court granted special dispensation for Schettino to attend after a 
request by his lawyers but specified he was there 'as a defendant, not a
 consultant' and was only allowed to follow the proceedings.

Schettino's lawyer Domenico Pepe told AFP earlier: 'Schettino is confronting the whole world on his own.'

The
 lawyer, who was accompanying Schettino on the island, said the 
captain's former employer and ship owner Costa Crociere, the biggest 
cruise operator in Europe, had focussed the blame on him.

'It is very, very difficult because Schettino does not have the economic resources of Costa,' he said.
