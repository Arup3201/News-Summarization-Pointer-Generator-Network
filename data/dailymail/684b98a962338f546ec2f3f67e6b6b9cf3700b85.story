Last Saturday night millions of football fans watched as Real Madrid won the European Cup in one of the most eagerly-awaited fixtures of the sporting calendar.

But, according to a Heineken advert shown in Brazil before the game, none of them were women, as they were all too busy shopping for shoes instead.

In the ad, the beer brand teamed up with Shoestock to offer a 50 per cent off shoes sale online and in stores, starting at exactly the same time as the game, in order to keep wives and girlfriends of sports fans busy.

Brewer Heineken put on a three-hour shoe sale during the European Cup final last weekend, offering men the chance to distract their wife or girlfriend so they could watch the match in peace

The advert has been removed from YouTube after attracting a barrage of criticism for its sexist content

In the short clip, a voice-over offers men the opportunity to watch the game with their friends 'without ditching the wife, because this time she'll be ditching you'.

The voice-over adds that the sale will give women 'everything to make her think only about shoes, and especially not about where you are.'

It ends by saying that you - meaning a man - will be happy with your friends, while your wife will be happy with you.

The film, which was made by Wieden+Kennedy, provoked outcries of sexism from female sports fans in Brazil before it was removed from YouTube.

That isn't entirely surprising, given that during the 2010 World Cup, the majority of Brazilian viewers were women.

One user wrote: Thank you, Heineken, for 
reminding me that my place is JUST in a store thinking about my 
appearance and not drinking your beer, which was my favourite, watching 
sports with my friends, which I thought was fun.'

The advertising company who came up with the promotion attempted to defend it, saying it 'in no way alludes to male-chauvinism' (pictured, Christiano Ronaldo plays in the Champions League final on Saturday)

Saturday's final between Real Madrid and Athletico de Madrid saw Real walk away with the title, thanks to an injury-time header from Sergio Ramos and an extra-time goal from Welshman Gareth Bale (pictured)

When challenged by Business Insider, Wieden+Kennedy said: 'The idea in no way alludes to male-chauvinism. Itâ€™s an idea that plays with the different interests that may exist among couples.

'We had no intention of reinforcing stereotypes or causing any kind of discomfort or embarrassment.'

The company added that the advert was meant to generate conversation and was 'entirely good-natured.'
