Fans were treated to a side of Andy Murray not often seen today as he spent some time with his two young cousins as he prepares for his crunch match with Mikhail Youzhny for a place in the quarter finals.

The British number one was seen chatting to and hugging his two young cousins, 10-year-old twins Cora and Ailsa Erskine, at the The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in Wimbledon, south London.

And girl-of-the-moment Robson was also on-court today, preparing for her crunch battle with Estonia's Kaia Kanepi.

Murray's brother Jamie is also on court tomorrow with his mixed doubles partner, Su-Wei Hsieh of Taipei.

They looked set to lose to Jean-Julien Rojer of the Netherlands and Russia’s Vera Dushevina when the match was halted due to fading light on Saturday.

There may be no on-court action at 
Wimbledon today, but there is still excitment in the air as tennis fans 
camp out for up to two days to get tickets for 'Mega Monday'.

As anticipation builds for Andy Murray
and Laura Robson's clashes tomorrow resold tickets are selling for 
£4,000-a-pair, while the men’s final tickets are soaring towards an 
eye-watering £30,000-a-pair.

Four
million are expected to watch on BBC TV as Murray, 26, tackles Russia’s
Mikhail Youzhny and Robson, 19, faces Estonia’s Kaia Kanepi - as 
Britain savours having a man and woman in the fourth round for the first
time since Tim Henman and Sam Smith in 1998.

Some fans have camped two nights since Saturday to get hold of 500 on-the-day £86 tickets for Centre Court - which includes Murray’s match - and 500 £69 seats for No 1 Court, where Robson will play.

Wimbledon’s No 1 fan Sue Callaghan, 60, from Surrey, who has queued at every tournament for 40 years and camped for Monday, said: 'I think Murray will win it this year - and Robson’s doing really well too.'

The cheapest resold tickets for Centre Court were £4,371-a-pair with online ticket agency Viagogo.

The lowest-price seats for No 1 Court were £3,910-a-pair with eBay’s StubHub ticket arm.

Viagogo said the number of ticket searches on its site were a record-breaking four times higher than at the same stage of last year’s tournament.

Men’s final tickets now cost up to £23,609 per pair, with the cheapest pair at £8,855, higher than the same stage of last year’s Wimbledon.

Viagogo said ticket prices were expected to leap up again as Murray progresses. Maximum prices are expected to close in on £30,000 per pair of tickets

A Viagogo spokespeson said: 'This Wimbledon has seen record ticket demand and we expect further increases if Murray advances.'

But, amid fears of fans being tempted into paying sky-high prices they cannot afford, Wimbledon chiefs say they are 'not concerned' about resold ticket prices.

Wimbledon spokesman Jon Friend said: 'The price of resold tickets is beyond our control. Debenture tickets are allowed to be resold and the price is controlled by the market, not us.'

All England Club chief executive Richard Lewis said: 'It’s symbolic of how popular tickets are. It’s not something that causes us huge concern because it’s a legitimate market.'

But queuing fans branded Wimbledon 
chiefs a 'disgrace' after it emerged bosses sold up to 600 face-value 
Centre Court tickets for tomorrow via a hush-hush internet sale at 9am 
yesterday.

Many fans 
are unaware tickets are sold the day before each day’s play via 
Ticketmaster as news of the sale is buried at the bottom of the 
Wimbledon website’s ticket information page.

Scottish
fan Cameron Kennedy, 16, a student who lives in Berkshire and has 
family on the Isle of Arran, said: 'I had no idea tickets were sold via 
Ticketmaster. It’s not fair.

'The extra tickets should be given to fans who queue, as they are the ones who make the effort.'

Murray is joined in the fourth round by Laura Robson after she beat Marina Erakovic to book a meeting with Estonia's Kaia Kanepi

Expectation has been mounting on the hard-battling 19-year-old

Some fans who queued have complained that some tickets were quietly sold online

Daniel McNulty, 25, an aircraft engineer from Liverpool, said: 'It’s disgraceful. Selling via the internet is not fair for fans like us who camp to get tickets.'

Scottish fan Scott Moorhead, 18, a student who lives in Cheshire and has family in Glasgow, who camped overnight for tickets, said: 'I’d be gutted if I was above 500th in the queue and missed out on Centre Court while people bought tickets online.'

Wimbledon spokesman Jon Friend said: 'Several hundred Centre Court tickets are sold via Ticketmaster each day.

'There are plenty of tickets on offer for the queue.'
