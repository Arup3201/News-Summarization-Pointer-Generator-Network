As comebacks go, this was roughly comparable to watching your favourite singer return to the stage in the twilight of their career - and finding they can barely hold a note.

The best thing about Tiger Woods’s eagerly awaited return on Thursday was that he got to the 18th green and was neither limping or clutching his back. His golf? Oh dear.

An opening tee shot that sailed out of bounds was shocking enough but to see the man who has played more great chip shots than any man in history cold-duff no fewer than four during his 18 holes was positively toe-curling.

In an 18-man field at the Hero World Challenge, Woods finished 18th after a decidedly unheroic opening round of 77. 

Woods told pgatour.com: 'It was weird. I didn't feel like I hit it that bad. My short game was awful, and I didn't make anything. It was just one of those days where nothing went my way.

'I hit a lot of good shots and I got nothing out of it, obviously. Bad chips, bad putts and a couple of missed shots on the front nine on the wrong side really compounded the problem.

'I hit terrible chips - that's something I need to work on when I get home. It certainly is surprising that I could hit chips that poorly.' 

It left him a mile behind Jordan Spieth, as the remarkable 21 year old American continued from where he left off on Sunday, when he won the Australian Open with a brilliant final round 63.

He stood six under for his first round, while Graeme McDowell, twice a winner of this event, shot a fine 68.

To be fair to Woods, there were plenty of sound reasons for putting this horror round down to rust and lack of competitive edge. It’s four months since he last played but it’s at least twice as long as that in reality, given there were plenty of issues with his back long before he finally gave in to reason last August.

Goodness, did it show.

Yet in the build-up there were plenty of pundits who expected him to turn in a good first round. For a start, physically he looked great. He played in the pro-am on Wednesday, shot two under par, with the fluid, remodelled swing under new coach Chris Como drawing rave reviews.

Jordan Spieth continued his electric form at the Hero World Challenge on Thursday with a six-under 66

The Isleworth venue is a course he’s played hundreds of times since he used to live next to the driving range.

So to his opening blow. Over the years we’ve seen some amazingly bad opening tee shots from someone so good. At the Open in 2003 he lost a ball, which took some doing on a hole lined by 10,000 people. 

At the Masters he once missed not only the first fairway but the adjacent ninth as well. At the 2006 Ryder Cup he finished in a lake that wasn’t on the radar.

Here was another spectacular contribution. An easy par four with a 40 yard wide fairway, Woods hooked it so badly it sailed out of bounds, finishing in the swimming pool in someone’s backyard.

Now that’s what you call a water hazard.

Woods did make a birdie with his provisional ball to limit the damage to a single dropped shot but another miss to the left on the difficult par three second meant a bogey-bogey start.

Then it got worse.

At the 7th he failed to get out of a greenside bunker. At the 8th, after almost finding another backyard with another errant approach, he stubbed a chip that barely travelled a foot.

The resultant double bogey, followed by a rare par at the 9th, meant a front nine played in 41 shots. On a course where he once shot 59 for 18 holes. By that stage he was already ten shots behind Spieth.

Steve Stricker was also making his comeback after being out for the same time as Woods, and shot 67

Over the back nine there were some encouraging signs. The swing certainly looks far more natural and, after hitting just one fairway on the front nine, he started locating some on the inward half. At the 12th, his approach almost finished in the hole for a tap-in birdie.

Another looked likely at the par five 13th, when his second shot landed just 10ft from the hole. But, as all Isleworth members know, there’s a slope here that throws the ball off the green to the right if you’re too aggressive, and that’s what happened. 

From there, Woods clunked not one chip shot but two, and walked off with a shattering bogey six. When he did it again at the 16th, he looked ready to explode.

It’s going to take some time, isn’t it?

Meanwhile, 46-year-old Steve Stricker was also playing his first round since the USPGA Championship in August.

He breezed round in 67.
