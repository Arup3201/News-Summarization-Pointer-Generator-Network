Spain has finally emerged from a two-year recession with figures showing that the country's economy grew in the last quarter in spite of extremely high unemployment.

Burgeoning exports saw the economy grow 0.1 per cent in the third quarter, according to figures from the National Statistics Institute released today.

But economists still warned that the road to recovery will still be a tough one for the Eurozone's fourth-biggest economy and that unemployment, which is still just under 26 per cent, will remain exceptionally high for at least another five years.

Recovery: Spain is the latest Eurozone country to exit recession as figures show its economy grew by 0.1 per cent in the last quarter

Meanwhile, house prices in the Irish capital Dublin are rising faster than they were during the height of the property boom, just months after the country's economy emerged from recession.

House prices rose almost 4 per cent in just four weeks in September and are expected to have risen some 20 per cent before the year is out.

Both countries have been bailed out by the Eurozone after hitting trouble following the 2008 crash.

Although the Eurozone offered Spain almost 100 billion Euros (£85.5 billion) in bailout payments last year, it only accepted 41 billion (£35 billion) in exchange for reforms and close international monitoring.

Ireland meanwhile accepted a three-year, 67.5 billion euro (£57 billion) bailout from the Eurozone and the International Monetary Fund.

The 0.1 per cent growth to the Spanish economy signals the end of the country's second recession in five years sparked by the collapse of a building boom in 2008.

The Institute's figures confirm earlier projections from Spain's central bank.

Not all joy: Despite signs of recovery, queues like this can still be expected at Spanish job centres with unemployment expected to remain above 25 per cent until at least 2018

But the International Monetary Fund has warned that unemployment in the country will remain above 25 per cent until at least 2018.

And analysts believe that a full recovery could be held back by a lack of domestic consumer spending.

A report compiled by Capital Economics said: 'While economic prospects are considerably better than a year ago, particularly in the external sector, domestic weakness is like to hold back any recovery in the wider economy.

'We expect the unemployment rate to remain around its current high levels for some time yet and public debt to continue to climb.'

The Spanish government expects an overall growth of 1.3 percent for 2013 - slightly better than the 1.6 percent in 2012 - before a return to timid growth of 0.7 percent in 2014.

Consumer price inflation in Spain slowed in October to 0.1 percent compared to a year earlier, according to other preliminary data from the statistics institute and EU estimates.

The institute attributed the easing in October to a fall in the price of food and a smaller rise in university fees than in the previous year.

Inflation has been easing in Spain since peaking in October 2012, in line with a general easing in the Eurozone indicated by the European Union data agency Eurostat.

Spain has pushed through painful spending cuts to bring down its soaring public deficit under pressure from the European Union.

It also last year passed labour reforms that have made it cheaper for companies to hire and fire workers.

Rocketing prices: Homes in the city are expected to have risen by around 20 per cent over the course of a year

Spain resisted pressure last year to seek a full bailout from its neighbours but accepted 41.3 billion euros (£35.3 billion) in Eurozone rescue loans for its banks.

Meanwhile, despite only announcing that it had emerged from recession last month, the property market in Irish capital Dublin saw house prices rise by 3.9 per cent last month - a faster rate than during the property boom.

That rise means that property prices in the city have rocketed a staggering 12.2 per cent over 12 months.

That annual increase is expected to reach 20 per cent by the end of the year.

During September, the price of a 300,000 Euro (£256,000) home rose by around 12,000 Euro (£10,278) according to the Central Statistics Office.

According to the Irish Independent, a combination a pent-up demand from cash buyers and a shortage in family homes is the cause of the rapid rise.

The rise comes amid warnings of a property bubble in Dublin, and the Government is being urged to ease pressure on the housing stock by ensuring that families have access to cheap housing.

Rural areas have not seen the same rise.

Overall, house prices are still down almost 50 per cent in Dublin since they were at their peak during the boom in 2007.

Planning permission has already been secured for 10,000 new homes in the capital.
