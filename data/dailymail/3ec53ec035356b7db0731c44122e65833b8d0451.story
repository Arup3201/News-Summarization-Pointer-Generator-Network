Wolves chairman Steve Morgan has been charged by the Football Association after his touchline outburst at referee Mike Jones.

The Molineux chief was fuming after Jones sent off Rajiv van La Parra and Matt Doherty in Saturday's 2-1 defeat by Bournemouth.

It was Wolves' fifth straight defeat in the Sky Bet Championship and an angry Morgan confronted Jones at the final whistle. 

Wolves chairman Steve Morgan has been charged by The FA after allegedly using inappropriate language

An FA statement read: 'Wolverhampton Wanderers chairman Steve Morgan has been charged by The FA following the game against AFC Bournemouth on 6 December 2014.

'It is alleged that his language and/or behaviour after the end of the fixture was abusive and/or insulting and/or improper.'

Jones had been relegated from the Barclays Premier League following a poor display in Manchester City's 3-0 win at Southampton last week.

Morgan did apologise on Sunday and has until 6pm on Thursday to respond to the charge.

'I would like to apologise personally to Mike Jones. I was extremely angry and frustrated at many of his refereeing decisions, and I still am,' Morgan told the club's official site.

'However, I should not have gone pitch side to vent my frustrations.'

Wolves were leading 1-0 when Van La Parra was dismissed for what looked like a clash of heads with Steve Cook while Doherty walked late on after a tackle on Brett Pitman.

Both face three-match bans but boss Kenny Jackett has confirmed the club will appeal the decisions.

He told the Wolverhampton Express & Star: 'We will certainly appeal on both fronts. Personally, and it's only my opinion, I do think that we have a case.

'The information that I've got from the officials is that Van La Parra led with his elbow and because of that it was a red card.'
