Charles Green launched an outspoken defence of Mike Ashley and the current Rangers regime.

In a staggering interview granted to Sky Sports from a hospital bed, the former Rangers Chief Executive shot down internet rumours he had been arrested over his role in the Ibrox club's demise.

A much-derided figure following the doomed takeover which left Rangers back at the financial precipice, however, Green claimed Mike Ashley is the right man to turn the club around. And took a verbal swipe at would-be owner and fans favourite Dave King, insisting current director Sandy Easdale is more deserving of supporter adulation.

Pausing for dramatic effect throughout Green, in hospital for a knee operation, said: 'Days like today make me think I should go back (to Rangers).

'The current team are doing a great job. Maybe the fans don't like them and don't like Mike Ashley.

'I don't like Mike Ashley, but I do believe he is the right man for the job.

'I actually think his team are the right people.

'Derek Llambias (Chief Executive) might have had a charisma bypass, but actually he is a good guy doing a good job. He did it at Newcastle.

Green said that current chief exec Derek Llambias (right) was a good guy despite having a 'charisma bypass'

Green then hit out at would-be owner Dave King by mentioning he has numerous convictions against his name

'I met him when I took Llambias into Ibrox when we did the deal for the naming rights (sold to Sports Direct for a pound).

'The reality is that these people have done nothing but good.

'They have put money in.

'Sandy Easdale is exactly the same.

'All Sandy Easdale has done is put his hand in his pocket, pull money out and put it into Rangers.

'He hasn't taken any money out and yet the fans are slaughtering him.

'Yet here we have Dave King. Sandy has one charge and one conviction against him – Dave King has 40 to settle with the South African authorities.

'You have Sandy Easdale, who has put money in – Dave King who hasn't.'

Expressing regret over the disharmony and split between board and supporters Green – who left Rangers with a near £1million pay-off in 2013 – urged fans to give Ashley time.

The Newcastle United owner has been prevented from buying more shares by SFA dual interest regulations and angered fans by posting advance notice of a plan to take Ibrox as security against a potential £10million loan.

'That club is going backwards,' adds Green, 'the fans are the greatest asset Rangers have, the fanbase.

'What you have to have with any club is unity.

'Man United didn't like it when Glazer took over.

'But Glazer put more money into that club than Martin Edwards ever did.

'This is what you have to do – stand back and judge people. And Ashley and his team have done nowt wrong.'

The future of the Scottish giants remains uncertain following continuing financial problems

Strongly defending his own record after the £22million raised by a share issue in December 2012 was swallowed up by losses of £1million a month and a rampant culture of boardroom pay-offs Green insists: 'My salary was £360,000 a year. It was going to be double that when we were in the SPL.

'When we were thrown out of the SPL I halved my salary.

'Ally McCoist refused to – so he kept his £760,000.

'I thought as Chief Executive I would get the same as Martin Bain, who was on the same as I was on.

'But I reduced my salary and was paid 12 months' notice as my contract allowed me.

'I was entitled to stock options twice my salary and I never took them.

'So all this rubbish that Charles Green raped and pillaged that club is not true.

'When I left Rangers there was over £18million in the bank.

Green alleged that Ally McCoist ignored the club's delicate financial situation and refused to take a pay cut

'Go and get a copy of the bank statement. I left, on April 13 - driven out by the board.

'They didn't want me there because of the Craig Whyte issue, which we can't talk about. I left so the club could move forwards – it has gone backwards.'

Further denying widespread internet rumours of his arrest by Police Scotland in connection with an investigation into the takeover of the club three years ago Green insisted: 'No, I haven't.

'I have met Police Scotland on two occasions in connection with the previous ownership of the club.

'It is an ongoing investigation and it was nothing to do with my running of the club.

'Just let's be clear. I raised £35million for that club when it was in a much worse condition than it is today.

'When I was sat at meetings with (Hibs chairman) Rod Petrie who was saying, 'oh well, just hand the titles back, hand the cups back.'

'I wouldn't do that. I fought for Rangers...'
