Police officers who interviewed Jimmy Savile in 2009 over child sex abuse allegations discouraged the Crown Prosecution Service from pursuing the case, it has emerged.

The former BBC DJ, who died two years later, was interviewed under caution by Surrey Police at Stoke Mandeville Hospital after a woman claimed she had been abused as a girl at Duncroft Approved School for Girls in Staines in the 1970s.

But, after a 41-minute interview in which he was also asked about abuse claims at Stoke Mandeville, he was allowed to walk free.

Police discouraged prosecutors from pursuing child sex abuse claims made against Jimmy Savile in 2009

And it has now emerged that on October 10 2009 - nine days after the interview, which took place in Savile's own office in the hospital - police advised prosecutors not to pursue Savile.

In a newly-released note, officers told the CPS Savile had denied all of the claims, explaining that he, as a celebrity, attracts claims like these, according to the Mirror.

The note, which had a number of grammatical errors, added: 'He stated if there was nay [sic] prosecution he would take the women to civil court and sue them for making unfounded allegations.'

This note followed an interview in which Savile, 83 at the time, told police: 'I've never, ever done anything wrong.'

This is a transcript of the interview conducted by Surrey Police with Savile in October 2009. It was released earlier this year by the force following a Freedom of Information request

The interview took place in Savile's own personal office at the Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Buckinghamshire

After this was accepted with an 'OK', Savile added: ‘That doesn’t mean to say that in my 
business you don’t get accused of just about everything because people 
are looking for a bit of blackmail or the papers are looking for a 
story, so they keeps going up but if you gotta clear conscience which I 
have everything’s okay.’

Savile was asked 50 questions through the interview, with the transcripts released earlier this year following a Freedom of Information request.

An officer told the CPS: 'As previously advised this will be marked NFA [not for action].'

Two years after the interview, Savile died at the age of 84.
