Manchester United face a fight to keep Danny Welbeck and Tom Cleverley, with Everton planning a double swoop for the pair.

Manager
 Roberto Martinez will consider a move for  Welbeck if Everton fail to 
strike a deal to keep on-loan Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku, who is also wanted by Tottenham and would command a transfer fee of more than £20million.

A deal for Cleverley would be easier, as the midfielder has only 14 months on his contract.

Admirer: Roberto Martinez insists the criticism of Cleverley has been unfair

Martinez, who had the Manchester 
United man on loan at Wigan Athletic, sees Cleverley as a replacement 
for Leon Osman, with £8million the likely price for the 24-year-old.

The
 Spaniard is an admirer of the England midfielder, whose contract runs 
out next summer, and insists the criticism he has received is 
unfortunate.

'What has happened is not Tom’s fault, I think he is as good a talent as we have in the English game, and he is still growing,' said Martinez.

'There are only a few players in this country who have had the sort of education where they look as if they could have been brought up in Holland, Spain or France.

'You wouldn’t get this in other countries, and I find it disappointing that he is being judged so aggressively when he has not even reached 200 games.

'Such a young player does not need that sort of scrutiny or pressure, but I am sure he will come through it and be even more motivated.'

Martinez claims Cleverley wasn't suited to the English game, and instead would have fitted in well in the Eredivisie or in La Liga.

Tom Cleverley enjoyed a fruitful season in the Premier League with Wigan in 2010-11, playing 25 times and scoring four goals 

If Cleverley does move to Goodison Park, he could fit in to the style of Everton's play, which has brought success this term.

He said: 'I always said that, technically and tactically, Tom wasn’t a normal player in this country – he could have easily fitted into the Dutch way of playing and also had the ability of the Spanish side.

'He is a real example of someone who has the talent but just needs the platform and environment and direction to be allowed to express himself.'

Last month, after an online campaign was started to keep Cleverley out of the England squad, Martinez said: ‘I don’t understand it. Tom is part of this new generation of outstanding English talent.

‘There are only a few players who look as if they could have been brought up in Holland or Spain or France because of their understanding of the game, their tactical awareness and their technical quality. Tom has got that.

‘Then as a boy, he has got the perfect temperament. He is a level-headed boy. I just don’t understand this campaign.'
