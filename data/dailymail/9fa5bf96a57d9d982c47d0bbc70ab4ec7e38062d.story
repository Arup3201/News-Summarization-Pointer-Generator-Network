Sepp Blatter was given an extraordinary mandate to carry on as FIFA president for as long as he wants as he declared he is ready to stand for a fifth term next year.

This followed FIFA Congress delegates voting overwhelmingly against age and term limits for existing officials, paving the way for 78-year-old Blatter to lead world football’s ruling body as an octogenarian and beyond.

A number of European associations, including the FA, had proposed the age-limit motion.

Instead Blatter can remain indefinitely despite the scandal surrounding the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

He immediately hit back at FA chairman Greg Dyke and Dutch chief Michael Van Praag, who had called on him to stand down at UEFA’s summit on Tuesday.

He said: ‘I have had to accept a number of blows but what I saw and heard at the UEFA meeting was the most disrespectful thing I have experienced in my entire life, on the football pitch and in my home.’

Blatter,
 in typical style, had done his best to deflect attention from Qatar by 
suggesting the only reason football is under such scrutiny is because of
 its popularity and then predicting that one day there will be an 
inter-planetary competition as well as a World Cup.

Blatter
 also proposed that managers should be allowed two challenges to 
refereeing decisions during a match, with immediate reviews of TV 
evidence.

And
 in another vote-chasing tactic, he reported that all 209 FIFA member 
countries would receive a $750,000 (£450,000) bonus, with the 
Confederations getting £4.2m.
