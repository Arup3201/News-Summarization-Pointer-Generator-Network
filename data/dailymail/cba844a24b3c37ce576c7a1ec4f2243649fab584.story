This is the shocking moment a 'bored' thug karate kicked a middle-aged woman in the face as she walked down a street.

Mariola Symanska, 54, was on her way home from the shops in Gdansk, Poland, when the alleged attacker, Piotr Czarnecki, approached her and attacked her because he wanted to 'practice his martial arts'.

The 27-year-old suspect kicked her in the stomach before raising his leg to kick her in the face as she strolled past with her bags.

Random attack: Mariola Symanska, 54, is walking home from the shops in Gdansk, Poland, alleged attacker, Piotr Czarnecki, approaches her

Callous: The 27-year-old launches the attack by kicking her in the stomach

As she collapsed on the floor in pain, he walked off as if nothing had happened.

The horrified victim told local media: 'I have no idea who this man is and I don’t know why he attacked me.'

'As he approached me he was saying something very loudly to himself, and then he just attacked.'

A police spokesman said the alleged attacker had since been arrested.

Czarnecki said he did it because he was bored, and he had wanted to practice some of his 'moves' on the next person to walk past.

He faces 3 years in jail for carrying out the callous attack.
