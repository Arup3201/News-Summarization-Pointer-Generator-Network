Pamela Anderson, a long-time and incredibly vocal advocate for animal rights, has reached out to an Australian celebrity who she thinks may be destined to forge the same plant-lined path.

Anderson, 47, sent a hamper overflowing with cruelty-free products to model Lara Bingle, who recently announced she and partner Sam Worthington were living a vegetarian lifestyle.

'I hear you are following a plant-based diet', the Baywatch star wrote in a personal note accompanying the hamper.

Lara Bingle recently said in an interview she and partner Sam Worthington were living a vegetarian lifestyle

The hamper, sent via animal rights group PETA included a whole host of meat and dairy-free products

'I'm sure you'll find it keeps you fit and healthy. I thought you might like to try some of these delicious vegan foods that my friends at PETA helped me put together,' Anderson continued.

Bingle announced in an interview with Paula Joye's website The Joye that she and Worthington that she decided to make the change to vegetarianism in late 2013, saying yo-yo dieting over the years had a negative effect on her body. 

'This change has made me feel stronger and healthier. My boyfriend Sam and I are both vegetarian, so we help each other. I cook a lot when we’re at home. We’re very ‘planty’ people,' the model told the website.

Included in the hamper, filled with produce from Cruelty Free Products, was faux bacon, cheedar 'cheese' sauce, herb pate and a hot cocoa mix. 

Anderson recommended beach beauty Bingle try the chocolate truffles first

The Australian-born beauty has previously described herself as a 'planty' person

Organic chocolate, cacao nibs, quinoa crackers, risotto and a thai green curry paste were also included in the package, as was a PETA vegan starter kit.

Anderson also wrote in the attached note: 'It's easier than ever to avoid all the fat and cholesterol in animal foods while indulging in great-tasting treats.  

The animal rights activist also recommended her favourite pick from the basket.

'The chocolate truffles are amazing – I'd eat those first.'

Lara Bingle's publicist told Daily Mail Australia she is currently out of the country and therefore has not received the package.

Bingle's publicist said she had not yet received the package as she is currently overseas

Many other Australian personalities are known for their dedication to the plant-based lifestyle including singers Sia and Xavier Rudd, and actor Isabel Lucas. 

Anderson has been a member of PETA for decades, promoting veganism and campaigning against the use of real fur.

She has appeared in many campaigns for the group, often stripping down to little or nothing to get her point across.
