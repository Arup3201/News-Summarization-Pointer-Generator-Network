Christian Eriksen admits Tottenham remain a 'work in progress' under Mauricio Pochettino.

The Danish international has been a cornerstone of Pochettino's first season at White Hart Lane, though both player and team have been inconsistent thus far.

Spurs sit 11th in the Barclays Premier League, having won just three of their first nine matches under the former Southampton boss, but Eriksen is not surprised that the transition has not been seamless.

Eriksen has been a key player at White hart Lane this season, but admits his side have not yet adapted

'As players, we are all trying to adapt to Mauricio's new style of play and we won't know everything straight away,' he told the Evening Standard.

'It is still a work in progress but, hopefully, we won't take too long to get it right.

'We could have done better in some games. We have had some good results but some disappointing defeats too, although it is easy to forget that we are still working with a new manager.'

Mauricio Pochettino was unimpressed with the performance against Newcastle where they relinquished a lead

'You can already see that we are starting to play the way he wants us to, and the more we work together, the better the results will be. 

'We have been saying that it is important to have a high level of performance in our upcoming games.'

Eriksen says Spurs players need time to get playing the way their manager wants them to
