Jose Mourinho may insist Diego Costa can do 'almost nothing' between matches  but Chelsea's £32million striker is fighting fit to be unleashed on Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League.

The 25-year-old has eight goals in six Premier League games since joining from Atletico Madrid and took part in a Chelsea training session at Cobham before Tuesday night's match in Portugal.

Mourinho knows Costa must be handled with extreme care, but the Stamford Bridge boss wants him to play his part in Chelsea maneuvering a way beyond the Champions League group stages.

'He is doing almost nothing,' said Mourinho after Chelsea beat Aston Villa 3-0 at Stamford Bridge. 

'He’s just resting and recovering from the tight muscle he has every time he accumulates fatigue. I hope he goes home after this game and sleeps until (Sunday) morning.

'He cannot be at the top of his game but even so, scoring a goal is good for his confidence, especially for a player who isn’t training as he should because we are protecting him.' 

John Terry is poised to make his 100th Champions League appearance for Chelsea on Tuesday, but Mourinho will be more concerned with the state of Brazilian trio Oscar, Willian and Ramires.

The Chelsea manager has been anxious about his players' conditions, following  an international break and the summer's World Cup, and is monitoring the situation closely.

'They need holidays, they don’t have holidays,’ he said. ‘They need a proper pre-season, they don’t have a proper pre- season. I think players are getting in trouble and when I anticipate the next pre-season it will be even worse, because there will be international matches.

‘For a World Cup some teams don’t qualify; for the international fixtures, every player goes with his national team. After that, before the start of the Premier League, they are going to have, like, two weeks of pre-season.’ 

Sporting Lisbon go into the Champions League clash having drawn 1-1 with Primeira Liga rivals Porto at home on Friday. Marco Silva's men are yet to lose in Portugal with two wins and four draws placing them seventh in the table.
