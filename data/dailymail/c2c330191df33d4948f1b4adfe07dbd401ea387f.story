A soldier's dramatic account of a pivotal moment in the Battle of Waterloo has been unearthed after 200 years.

Corporal Richard Coulter was part of the 'glorious' charge of the Household Heavy Brigade in the famous battle which left British swords 'reeking with French blood'.

Despite heavy casualties, the attack on June 18, 1815 proved to be a turning point in the one-day battle at a time when Napoleon Bonaparte's forces had the upper hand.

A soldier's dramatic first hand account of the Battle of Waterloo has been unearthed after 200 years

Days after the battle, which brought to an end the French dictator's plans to rule Europe, Cpl Coulter wrote home to a cousin, giving a graphic account of the fighting.

The soldier, who was a cabinet maker from Northumberland before he joined the army in 1809 and served in the Life Guards, described how he survived being stabbed in the shoulder.

He then told how he had fled on foot from 1,500 bayonet-wielding enemy soldiers after his horse was cut down 20 yards from their position.

He wrote: 'We had very hard fighting and with men of no despicable size or appearance.

'I received a cut on my bridle hand, had a sword run through my jacket in the shoulder.

'We drove them under their own cannon into their own lines and stay'd their (sic) too long, for the infantry began to play upon us.

'I had my horse shot in a charge against a solid column of infantry...he received another ball, he tumbled over another horse... about 20 yards from the face of the column of 15 hundred or 2 thousand men.

'I struggled to get clear, they saw me and sent some musket shot at me but they struck the horses. My poor horse had a great many balls in him.

'I got my legs clear looked over his neck, and saw more approaching to bayonet me. I mustered all my strength and run off faster than I ever went to school in my life, their flankers fired after me.'

On his retreat he described seeing 'the road covered with dead men and dead horses.'

He added: 'This was a Glorious Charge we returned and was Huzza'd by the infantry which they had threatened with destruction. Our swords reeked with French Blood.' 

The letter has now emerged for sale at auctioneers Bonhams.

A spokesman said: 'This letter is a vivid, first hand account of the battle. It has a great immediacy about it and goes into great detail.'

Cpl Coulter  joined the army in 1809 and served in the Life Guards.

At 2pm on June 18, 1815, with Napoleon winning the battle, the Household Brigade led by Lord Edward Somerset crossed the crest of the Allied position and charged downhill in support of the hard-pressed infantry.

The charge destroyed an enemy brigade but attempts to recall them failed and they became overrun by the enemy.

Maj Gen Ponsonby became surrounded by a group of lancers who beckoned to him to surrender after recognising his rank. Several comrades spotted the danger and rode to his rescue which prompted a lancer to spear him to death.

The letter is being sold by Bonhams on April 1. 

Dear Cousin, 

We had very hard fighting and with men of no despicable size or appearance I mean their Curassiers in complete Armour if you had heard us the first Charge we made on the 18th you had been reminded of Mr Greenwoods Braizer's Shop such a rattling of swords about their Backs & Helmets it was really Laughable.

My Horse had his eye almost cut Cut [sic] out we drove them under their own Cannon into their own lines and stay'd their too long, for the Infantry began to play upon us we retired and left but 3 or 4 behind and they were shot I think more in this Charge fell by the sword this was a Glorious Charge we returnd and was Huzza'd by the Infantry which they had threatened with destruction and a Regt of Belgian Cavalry our swords reeked with French Blood...

 I had my Horse shot in a Charge against a solid Column of Infantry... before I had got him twenty yards he received another Ball he tumbled over another Horse... about 20 yards from the face of the Column of 15 hundred or 2 thousand men I struggled to get Clear, they saw me and sent some musket shot at me but they struck the Horses. 

I squated down with my head but I was almost Breathless my poor Horse had a great many balls in him but struggled to extricate himself by this means I got my legs clear looked over his neck, and saw more approaching to bayonet me I musterd all my strength and run of[f] faster than I ever went to School in my life their flankers fired after me I tumbled down but not with their shot I was spent I up again and got clear of[f] to Waterloo a few hundred yards from where I fell; down the road was covered with dead men & dead Horses from one I got a cloak which with my sword & pouch was all store having lost every thing but what I stood upright in by pouch belt and sword Belt was all Blood what from the Horses & my own wound in the hand, during the time I lay amongst the Horses I received a dead ball against my left arm which made me believe it was broke but it only turn'd the Arm Black... 

I joined my Regt the next day it could not muster above 30 or 40 Men.

Our Col was kill'd one Capt Kill'd 2 Quartermasters 5 or 6 Corp.ls & 20 Men that we know of and 70 Wounded, all the Officers was wounded"; then giving news of his present whereabouts ("...we are now within five miles of Paris..."

The Battle of Waterloo on June 18, 1815 stopped the advance of Napoleon across Europe and sent the great French emperor into exile for a second and final time.

France's troops were defeated by a multi-national coalition, led by the British army under the command of the Duke of Wellington.

The armies amassed near the town of Waterloo in modern-day Belgium, not far from the border with France, and it was the French who made the first move around 11am.

The two sides clashed for 10 hours, with the British fending off repeated attacks from the French, until Marshal Blücher arrived at the head of a Prussian army.

This was the decisive intervention which finished Napoleon off, allowing Wellington to counter-attack and forcing the Frenchman to surrender.

The battle forced Napoleon from the throne of France, leading to his exile on St Helena - but Wellington later admitted it was 'the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life'.

Despite the popular image of Waterloo as a heroic endeavour, it was also the scene of brutal slaughter as thousands of troops were killed, with the French bearing the brunt of the losses.
