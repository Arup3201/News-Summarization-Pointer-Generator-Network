The Dominican prostitute who apparently claimed that Senator Robert Menendez attended sex parties and liked 'the youngest and newest' prostitutes now says that she fabricated the whole story.

Nexis de los Santos, 23, now admits that she 'never went to bed with' Menendez and never even met him, lawyer Vincio Castillo Seman told reporters in the Dominican Republic on Monday.

He released an affidavit from her regarding the email published yesterday by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW).

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Under fire: Menendez issued a denial yesterday against allegations that he slept with prostitutes in the Dominican Republic

The Washington Post identified Santos as the prostitute who made the original allegations in November - but the website that first broke the story insisted that this was a case of mistaken identity.

The Daily Caller said that a video of two unidentified prostitutes it posted at the time could not have shown Santos, as she is younger than the two women and neither of them went by her name.

Additionally, Santos said she had been covertly taped, whereas the women in the Daily Caller video were wearing earpieces and appeared to know they were on camera.

Santos told the Washington Post: 'I am the person in the 
video, that is me, and those are my words, but this statement is not 
true. I never agreed to be recorded.'

Senator Menendez, who has maintained all
 along that he never paid prostitutes for sex, said he is looking 
forward to whatever evidence emerges from courts in the Dominican 
Republic to vindicate him.

The Daily Caller said in a statement: 'The Washington Post falsely reported a story yesterday claiming our source had recanted her statement, without contacting The Daily Caller for comment before posting.

'In reality, the prostitute in the Post’s story does not appear to be one of the women we interviewed in 2012. Details provided by the prostitute identified as Ms Santana in the Post story conflict with the taped interviews The Daily Caller posted on November 1, including the mention of a person whose name would not come to light for months afterward.

'In addition, Melanio Figueroa, the attorney for TheDC’s sources, has said the Post's allegations are fabricated and that the affidavit is false. The Post would not provide TheDC with a copy of the affidavit, despite our request. We stand by our reporting.'

Accusations: This woman claims to have slept with Menendez for money in an interview with the Daily Caller

Scandalous: This is the second woman who says she had sex with Menendez while he was in the Dominican Republic

The
 Democratic politician has been hit with a series of allegations since 
November that he and a prominent donor frequently traveled by private 
plane to the Dominican Republic where they paid multiple prostitutes to 
attend their sex parties.

Last month the FBI raided the offices of wealthy Florida eye doctor, and Democrat donor, Salomon Melgen,
 who along with Menendez also denies the claims.

The
 email is part of a chain of whistle-blowing exchanges between CREW and a
 concerned American citizen who claims to have knowledge of Senator 
Menendez and his attendance of sex parties in the Dominican Republic.

Included in the exchange is an email 
from one of the girls who claims to have participated in these orgies 
and was paid by the senator for sex.

'In
 the beginning he seemed so serious, because he never spoke to anyone, 
but he is just like the others and has just about the same tastes as the
 doctor, very refined. I think they were taking us more often to get us 
checked [medically] because of him,' wrote the girl.

Her name is being withheld by MailOnline because she may have been a minor when her alleged encounters with Menendez occurred.

In her email, the young lady expresses fear at coming forward.

'I
 do not want to have problems with those people,” she wrote, adding that
 she believed 'I can trust you, that you will help us, and that nothing 
bad will happen to the other young girls, to me, or to my family.'

'The thing that worries me the most is that if they know that I spoke with someone they will find me,' she added.

Investigation: The FBI removes boxes from the West Palm Beach, Fla. office of Dr Melgen

The alleged prostitute says that she 
was working with a Dominican escort service called The Doll Palace and 
that a code word, 'chocolate' was used to summon her and other girls to 
Melgen's alleged sex parties.

To prove herself she gave detailed descriptions of Melgen's pimp and the houses where she slept with house guests.

The
 account is the most detailed since allegations emerged in November that
 Senator Menendez had attended sex parties in the Dominican Republic.

She is said to have told the whistle-blower who did not include her email with a cache of documents he sent to CREW on January 24th.

The DC was first to report on that dossier about Senator Menendez, which included an interview transcript in which a different woman claimed she was 16 when she began sleeping with him.

That young prostitute said she had sex with Menendez 'three times at least' in 2009.

'The first one in February, and then in May and June. I recall his visit in June so well because that month was my 17th birthday.'

Friend with a benefit? Dr Melgen gave trips on his private plane to Sen Menendez

Yesterday, New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez today denied allegations of sleeping with prostitutes in the Dominican Republic.

The Democratic politician was forced to issue the statement after the FBI raided the home of one of his big shot political donors, a prominent Florida eye doctor.

Dr Salomon Melgen, a contributor to Menendez and other politicians, has been suspected of providing free trips on his private plane to the Dominican Republic.

Menendez was first accused of 
sleeping with prostitutes on the island shortly before last November's election when 
the website the Daily Caller said he used Dr Melgen's plane to travel to
 the Dominican Republic to meet with the call girls.

He initially refused to address the report, calling it a bunch of 'fallacious allegations.'

Prostitution is legal in the Dominican Republic.

Menendez, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, did say he traveled on Dr  Melgen's plane on three occasions and trips were 'paid for and reported appropriately.'

Menendez's office did not say whether the three trips were to the Dominican Republic or elsewhere.

They also did not say whether the trips were paid by Menendez personally or by his senatorial or his campaign accounts, nor did it specify how they were reported.

If Menendez did not pay for the trips, he would have to report them on annual financial disclosure forms as gifts.

If he paid for the trips from his Senate office account, he would have to report them on Senate office forms. And if he used campaign funds, he would have had to report the expense on Federal Election Commission forms.

The Associated Press searched six years of office and travel-related 
expenses for Menendez's U.S. Senate office and found no reports 
reflecting payments to Melgen or trips aboard Melgen's plane.

The AP also found no apparent 
reimbursement to Melgen in more than six years' worth of campaign 
expenses on file with the Federal Election Commission.

Records filed in Palm Beach County 
show an Internal Revenue Service lien against Dr Melgen of more than 
$11.1million for unpaid taxes from 2006 through 2009.

Prior liens for taxes from 1998 to 2002 were subsequently withdrawn, records show.

Despite Dr Melgen's financial problems, he and his family have contributed at least $357,000 to candidates and committees since 1998, according to Florida and federal campaign records.

Of that, the Melgens have contributed about 9 percent to Menendez’s federal campaigns, the Miami Herald reported.

Dr Melgen has become regarded as a top ophthalmologist, speaking at conferences and even operating on then Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles in 1997.

Calls to Melgen's offices were forwarded to an answering service where receptionists told callers to try back Thursday.

Calls to Melgen's home in North Palm Beach, which is appraised at $2.1million, went unanswered.

In a statement to The New York Times on Wednesday, Dr Melgen's lawyer said: 'The government has not informed Dr Melgen what its concerns are. However, we are confident that Dr. Melgen has acted appropriately at all times.
