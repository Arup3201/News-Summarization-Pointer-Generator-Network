Angela Douglas, 49, told police she wanted her frail 73-year-old mother to 'go to sleep' after watching her battle with emphysema, Plymouth Crown Court heard

A drunken woman smothered her sick and elderly mother with a pillow because she couldn’t stand to see her in pain, a court has heard.

Angela Douglas, 49, told police she wanted the 73-year-old to 'go to sleep' after watching her battle emphysema, Plymouth Crown Court heard,

Douglas had been drinking heavily before deciding to suffocate her mother Anne Matthews, it was said.

Mrs Matthews was a former smoker who suffered from breathing problems.

She had suffered a heart attack - but was not terminally ill, jurors were told.

The court was told that when when paramedics arrived to start CPR she allegedly told them: 'I don’t want you to do anything - she has been through enough.'

Douglas admits killing her but denies murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

Prosecutor Martin Meeke QC told jurors there was no question that Douglas suffocated her mother but it was their job to decide if it was murder or manslaughter.

Mr Meeke told the court that Douglas visited her parents Anne and David, 72, in April last year with her partner Shane.

She cooked the family Sunday lunch and had taken her mother tea and biscuits in bed before her partner and her father discovered her kneeling and crying over her unconscious mother.

Mr Meeke said: 'On the 28 April last year the defendant decided to end her mother’s life.

'As her mother lay in bed, the defendant put a pillow over her mothers face and tried to suffocate her.

'Her mother must have struggled. She fell to the floor unconscious.'

The court heard an ambulance was called but when paramedics entered her bedroom, Douglas told them: 'I don’t want you to do anything, she’s been through enough.'

Asked if there was a ‘do not resuscitate agreement’ in place or an end of life care package, she replied: 'No there isn’t because my f****** family don’t agree with it.

'Can’t you let her go, can’t you leave her alone?'

Paramedics managed to revive Mrs Matthews but she died at Plymouth’s Derriford hospital at around 2:30am the next day.

Mr Meeke told the court that Douglas confessed to her partner that she had put a pillow over her mother’s face and killed her.

She called the police herself within hours of the incident and was arrested.

When questioned by officers, Douglas allegedly told them: 'I tried to kill my mother. I smothered her with a pillow. I love my mum, I can’t stand to see her like that.'

Douglas said she didn’t know if she wanted her mother to die but she said she wanted her to 'go to sleep'.

She said: 'I just lay down with her and stroked her. I think it’s cruel the way she’s been treated in and out of hospital.

'I just thought if I put a pillow over her face she would go to sleep. I don’t know whether I wanted her to die, I just wanted her to sleep.

'I then thought this isn’t good and I called the paramedic. I did push down and then thought "what the f*** are you doing?" and moved the pillow.'

Doctors later found impressions on Mrs Matthews’ face consistent with having her glasses forced into her skin with a pillow.

Mr Meeke told the court that ambulance workers thought Douglas was drunk as she was slurring her words.

Douglas said she didn't know if she wanted her mother to die but she said she wanted her to 'go to sleep'

Blood samples later revealed that she was as much as three-and-a-half times over the drink dive limit.

Mr Meeke said: 'The defendant was a practised drinker. She could manage a couple, and sometimes three bottles of wine in an evening.'

Douglas wept as the court heard how her mother, who had two other daughters, battled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

She had been released from hospital a couple of weeks before her death before being visited at home by a social worker and an occupational therapist.

Douglas, her mother’s principal carer, claims she was suffering from an abnormality of mental functioning which meant she didn’t know what she was doing.

She claims to have had been suffering from an adjustment disorder as a consequence of failing to come to terms with her mother’s failing health

The trial continues.
