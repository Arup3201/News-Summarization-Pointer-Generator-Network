A convicted robber has been flouting jail rules and telling the world by posting status updates on Facebook while behind bars.

Luke Jackel, 22, posted several messages on the social networking site from jail including ‘f** them police and judge ha’, joking about getting drunk while inside and uploading pictures of his new tattoo.

But while he should be punished for blatantly breaking prison rules, Jackel may have escaped reprimand after he was given early release while the posts were being investigated.

In another he wrote: ‘Im so ****n bord hurry up 2moz p*** up i tink ha ha.’

And another: ‘I gt da tat a day be4 i went pen (prison) g.

Even a Facebook friend warned him against blatantly breaking the rules, commenting on one of his updates: ‘OMG you can’t be on the phone in there u will get into trouble.’

On Facebook Jackel said of his sentence that he would ‘ride it like a soldier’ and ‘f*** them police and judge ha’.

The Prison Service terminates active profiles on Facebook if they are found to belong to serving prisoners but it is understood that Jackel will escape punishment it is believed he has been granted early release in recent weeks while the posts were being investigated.

The Prison Service said it would not confirm which jail Jackel had been kept in.

A spokesman said: ‘Prisoners have no access to the internet and are barred from updating Facebook while serving their sentence, or asking others to do so from outside prison.’

jailing them, recorder Ian Lawrie called them ‘a feckless pair who 
hadn’t done a day’s work’.

Bell had picked up a knife at the victim’s flat in nearby Wroughton and used it to threaten the man before taking cash, tobacco and a small amount of cannabis.

He also said he would ‘slice up’ a barking dog in the living room and told the victim and his friends to ‘hand over everything’.

Jackel and Bell, who had been smoking cannabis, both admitted robbery while on their way to buy more drugs.
