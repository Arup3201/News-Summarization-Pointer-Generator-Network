Reclining on his bed with an arrogant snarl, new pictures show paedophile Jimmy Savile lounging in his caravan where he may have abused a number of his victims.

They emerged as it was revealed Scotland Yard investigated the pervert for molesting a young girl in a mobile home at BBC Television Centre up to 30 years ago.

But they failed to act and merely warned him to stay away from children rather than take the chance to arrest him for his sick crimes.

Creepy photographs show the child 
abuser on his bed, while another shows its inside, where he 
may have sexually assaulted or raped victims.

Its front is emblazoned with the word 
'hustler' - the name of the Dodge vehicle.

Another, taken for a day in the life documentary, shows inside the caravan and Savile staring at people out of its window.

The
Jim’ll Fix It star faced questions in the 1980s after the child claimed
she was indecently assaulted in his caravan, which he had parked 
outside the BBC’s headquarters.

The allegation came to light after a retired officer from the Met’s juvenile bureau at Hammersmith and Fulham police station came forward.

He said there had not been enough evidence to prosecute Savile.

It is one of the earliest known full police inquiries into the entertainer and took place at the height of his abuse.

It means police missed at least seven chances to expose Savile’s crimes during his lifetime.

Officers in forces including the Met, Surrey and Sussex investigated his activities but the claims were never made public. And it raises fresh questions about what the BBC knew about his sordid activities and whether there was a cover-up.

Details of the investigation emerged as the man in charge of Scotland Yard’s investigation said it marks a ‘watershed’ in tackling child abuse.

Commander Peter Spindler said 300 people have now claimed to be victims of the TV presenter and others in his circle, while the size of the team responsible for the investigation has been trebled to 30.

The Child Exploitation and Online Protection Agency has been asked to examine whether anyone named by victims is still working with children.

These could include BBC staff and even doctors from some of the hospitals where Savile abused patients under the guise of charity.

Mr Spindler said: ‘While Britain reflects on how Savile was able to hide in plain sight, I think it’s quite important that we focus on what’s happening today in our society.

'Our activities in the coming weeks will be a stark warning to any men out there today who think they can exploit their positions of power and influence and abuse children and young people in Britain.

‘I want them to take heed and tell them that we will  come for them. You may  believe you will get away with your crimes.

'But one day – it might not be this decade – we will come and get justice for those victims. Victims may not want to speak straight away, but when they are ready, we will be listening.’

Scotland Yard’s inquiry, Operation Yewtree, is moving into a new and more secretive phase as detectives prepare to arrest surviving suspects.

The Met has also discovered a second complaint made in 2003 by a woman who said she had been abused in the 1970s, he revealed.

Mr Spindler added: ‘She did not want a prosecution but wanted us to know what happened in case there was a pattern of offending.’
