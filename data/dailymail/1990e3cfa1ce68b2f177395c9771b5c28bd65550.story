A defiant resident of what was a block of flats has prevented the last section of it from being torn down in protest over compensation.

Steadfast Zheng Meiju refused to move from her home, in Rui'an, Zhejiang Province, China, to make way for the construction of a new business plaza because she was unhappy with the amount of compensation that she was being offered.

Developers went ahead with the demolition a year ago, but had to stop before they destroyed her apartment, which occupies an end plot in what was a large block of flats.

The final remains of a building that Zheng Meiju lives in stands alone in a now empty plot in Rui'an, Zhejiang Province, China

Every day, Ms Meiju returns to her home to check that developers have not pulled it down, but with the hot weather, no electricity or water, she spends a lot of time at her friend's

For an entire year, Ms Meiju has 
survived without running water or electricity and has had to adapt her 
lifestyle to fit it with her basic living.

Every day she travels to her friend's house to fill buckets of water.

She said: 'I now fetch water every day from a friend's place. A return trip takes 20-30 minutes.'

The buckets line the hallway of her flat but due to the hot weather, she now spends much of her time at her friend's place.

Daily chores: Every day for a year Ms Meiju has brought buckets of water to the house, which has no running water or electricity

Every day, however, she returns to check that her home, built in a former 'nail house', has not been pulled down.

She added: 'I have to come back to the house every day, in case they dismantle my house secretly.'
