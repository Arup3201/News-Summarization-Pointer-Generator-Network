The ordeal for one of the victims began after she became desperate for love and attention because she was forced to care for her sick parents.

So when Mohammed Karrar entered her life, bought her perfume and treated her like an adult, she believed in him. But the ‘nicey-nicey honeymoon period,’ as she described it, would last barely a year.

After grooming her, Karrar made sure she was ‘out of it’ on drink and drugs before raping her on his sofa.

From that moment she became his ‘property’ and a sex slave loaned out to abusers around the country for up to £600 an hour.

Over five years she was repeatedly attacked in what she described as ‘torture sex’. Injected with heroin, she was sold to groups of Asian men who violently gang-raped her in bedsits and guesthouses around Oxford and elsewhere.

The victim identified as Girl D for legal reasons, frequently broke down in tears giving evidence via videolink as she described her horrific ordeal.

Following the rape, Karrar’s sadistic attacks became commonplace and sometimes he made ‘porn’ movies of her.

If she refused, he would beat her up and threaten her with weapons, once beating her with a baseball bat.

He even raped the girl, who came from a troubled family, at the home she shared with her parents.

Abuse was carried out at the Nanford Guest House in Oxford. Pictured is a room at the guest house

Karrar and his brother Bassam, who have been found guilty along with five other men of a string of sex crimes, forced her to have sex with one of them while she performed a sex act on the other.

Sobbing
 as she recalled telling Karrar about her pregnancy, she
 said: ‘He was f***ing fuming. He said I should have been a bit more 
responsible.’

Given 
two ‘ecstasy-like’ tablets, she was driven to a house in Reading where 
she was forced to undergo an illegal abortion using a long hook.

The teenager said she could not remember much of the procedure, but 
believes it took place on a hard living room floor. No doctors or nurses
 were present, there were no painkillers or medication.On one occasion, Karrar branded her flesh with hot metal.

‘He was branding me so that if I ever had sex with someone else, people would know I was his,’ she said.

Convicted: Seven members of a paedophile ring were found guilty at the Old Bailey yesterday of a catalogue of charges involving vulnerable underage girls who were groomed for sexual exploitation

Over the following four years Karrar took the girl around the country and sold her for ‘£600 a time’.

She was made to wear short skirts and bikini tops before being repeatedly raped. Parties were held at which she was asked to meet the sexual requirements of up to 15 ‘important guests’.

She later moved into a foster family away from Oxford and the nightmare stopped.Two years later she met Karrar after he convinced her he had changed.

During a conversation at his home she demanded to know why he had abused her and sold her for sex. He became angry and raped her a final time.

One victim said she had been so brainwashed by her abusers that even now she sometimes failed to see the evil in the men who had raped her.

Known only as ‘Girl Three’, she endured three years of abuse at the hands of the gang.

‘It was brainwashing. Even to this day I can almost say, “They were OK”,’ she said. ‘It’s delusional.

They turned me against my mum. They knew everything that they had to say to get a vulnerable person, a young person, on their side.’

Like many of the victims, she had experienced abuse as a child and was in care.

She was later adopted but rebelled by running away and drinking.
