Lance Armstrong has been fined $10million (£6.5m) for lying about his use of performance-enhancing drugs following an arbitration panel hearing into his case with SCA Promotions.

Dallas-based SCA Promotions was forced to pay Armstrong $7.5m in 2006 after an arbitration process over disputed payments relating to his seven Tour de France victories.

However, Armstrong has since admitted to doping in all seven of his Tour wins and was found to have lied in proceedings, leading to the payout.

A statement from SCA Promotions read: 'Lance Armstrong was hit with a record-breaking $10m sanctions award by the arbitration panel hearing his dispute with Dallas-based SCA Promotions, Inc.

'According to the arbitrators' written ruling, the sanctions award punishes Armstrong for engaging in 'an unparalleled pageant of international perjury, fraud and conspiracy'.

'The 10 million-dollar award, which must be paid directly to SCA Promotions, is believed to be the largest award of sanctions assessed against an individual in American judicial history.

'The award was made public today when SCA Promotions filed a motion with a Dallas state district court to have the award confirmed into a judgement against Armstrong.'
