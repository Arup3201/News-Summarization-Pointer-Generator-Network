Britain has seen a sharp rise in the number of people requesting food handouts as 'ordinary' working people and families fall on hard times.

In the past year alone FareShare, which redistributes 
surplus food from major manufacturers and supermarkets to social care 
charities, has seen a 20 per cent rise in the number of people who can't afford to feed themselves - from 29,000 per day to 35,000 per day.

Food donations are ordinarily taken up 
by the homeless and destitute, but now FareShare and similar 
organisations are seeing families and working people who have lost jobs 
benefiting from the service.

On the rise: Ordinary working people and families who have fallen on hard times are increasingly relying on free food handouts, says charity FareShare

'We're seeing a big increase in what you could call, for want of a 
better phrase, normal working people, those who have lost their jobs or 
seen their own businesses go under,' Jeremy Ravn, manager of the 
food bank network told The Observer.

'The big problem is that the welfare state is not 
reacting fast enough to need.'

The time it takes for benefits payments to come through after a claim has been accepted is increasing, Mr Ravn added, resulting in people going hungry. However, a spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions denied there had been any changes to the system that would result in the increase.

Hunger: Unemployment, redundancy and the time it takes for benefits payments to come through are all being blamed for the rise in demand of food handouts

The food that is distributed by FareShare would 
ordinarily go to landfill because it is out of date or is not fit for 
sale due to things like errors on packaging.

An estimated three million tonnes of 
food like this ends up being thrown away in Britain every year of which FareShare takes around 1 per cent.

But a third of the charities surveyed by FareShare are also
 facing Government funding cuts, with 65 per cent of these charities 
slashing food budgets to stay afloat.

Lindsay Boswell, chief executive of 
FareShare, said: 'At a time of unprecedented demand we want the food 
industry and the general public to increase their support.'

'We're asking anyone who works in the
 food industry in any capacity to look at what is happening to their 
surplus food and to ask themselves a simple question: "Could this food 
stop someone going hungry?"'
