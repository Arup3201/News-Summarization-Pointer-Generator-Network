A Canadian airline has sent a warning to its pilots to stop bringing pornographic material into the cockpit.

In an internal bulletin to staff, Air Canada threatened to sack and/or pursue criminal charges against pilots who were caught displaying ‘inappropriate material’ on a flight.

The warning was sent to employees after obscene material was discovered while an official with Transport Canada, the national industry regulator, was seated in the cockpit.

What's going on in there? Air Canada has warned pilots to stop displaying pornographic material in the cockpit

The bulletin was issued a year ago, but has recently been obtained by CBC News.

In the notice, Rod Graham, Air Canada’s chief pilot and director of fleet operations and training, warned pilots: ‘I am disappointed to have to raise this issue once again but unfortunately we have some people that have yet to understand the message.

‘To be clear, this issue only exists on the Embraer fleet and it must stop.’ 

He said the airline was attempting to identify pilots who were breaking the rules.

‘Once they are identified they will be subject to discipline to the full extent of the law and our corporate policies. This could include termination and/or criminal charges.’

Air Canada management warned that pilots could be sacked or face criminal charges if they are caught

It is not the first time pilots have been warned about the presence of porn in the cockpits of planes.

The bulletin circulated last year was issued just four months after an earlier warning, following complaints about pilots’ inappropriate behaviour.

A female pilot first started complaining to the Montreal-based airline around six years ago after finding pornography displayed, glued or tucked into areas within the cockpit, CBC News reported.

She provided photos and video of the material, including an image where a knife was drawn in the back of a woman, and an Air Canada investigation backed up her claims, but it remains a problem despite repeated warnings. 

 Air Canada says more explicit material was found in February – just months after a bulletin was issued

A Transport Canada investigation revealed that the pilots are not violating aviation safety rules but they are creating a hazard by stuffing ‘paper material’ into compartments with electrical wiring, according to an internal report obtained by CBC News.

The report’s author wrote that a complaint that it investigated is considered workplace violence and he or she suggested that the airline didn’t take it seriously enough.

Air Canada insists that it has responded with additional training for pilots, although it admitted that more explicit material was found in February – five months after the bulletin was issued to pilots.

Airline spokeswoman Isabelle Arthur told MailOnline that only one formal complaint has been filed and there is ongoing labour arbitration.

She said: ‘The material in question consisted almost entirely of inappropriate business cards and was confined mainly to one aircraft type and route, our Embraer E-90s operating to Las Vegas.

'It determined the frequency with which such materials were found to be limited. Air Canada has a strict zero tolerance policy to protect its employees against harassment of any kind, including inappropriate materials that may offend co-workers.'
