She has topped Vogue's list of the 
world's most stylish women, is the face of countless fashion brands, 
and scores a much-coveted spot on every fashion show front row.

She
even inspired Mulberry's must-have Alexa bag, so it seems fair to say that Alexa Chung knows a thing or two when it comes to style.

And now, as she prepares to promote her new fashion tome, the style muse has spoken out to say that women shouldn't change their hairstyle after splitting up with a partner because they aren't in a 'fit state' to make long-term decisions.

Advice: Alexa Chung says that women are not in a 'fit state' to get a radical overhaul and change their hairstyle after a split

The model and all-round style queen thinks women aren't in the right frame of mind to revamp their hairstyle after experiencing a dramatic event in their life and believes they may live to regret their decision.

In a self-penned feature in Stylist magazine, she said: 'Hair is so linked to how we feel and everyone goes for something radical after a break-up.

'But my advice if you've just suffered heartbreak or you've broken up with someone is to not touch your hair.

'It's the first thing women do, but you're not in a fit state to make decisions that are long term. You'll have to spend the next four years growing it out.'

Bad decision: She says that Britney Spears is a classic example of radical post-split hair disaster following her break-up from husband Kevin Federline back in 2007

She tells women not to have a fringe cut, bleach it or do anything because they'll live to regret it.

The 29-year-old says that she can gauge her friend's mental states judging by their hair.

She also says that Britney Spears is a classic example of a radical post-split hair disaster.

The songstress infamously shaved her head following her break-up from husband Kevin Federline back in 2007.

Alex is fairly discreet when it comes to her own love life.

She lived with fashion photographer David Titlow, twenty years her senior, for three-and-a-half years but the pair ended things in 2006.

She was also in a four-year relationship with Arctic Monkeys frontman Alex Turner from April 2007 until July 2011.

Author: The style queen is penning a book which will feature the fashion muse's witty writing, quirky sketches and hand-picked photographs

Alexa is releasing her debut book, It, in September.

The book will invite fashion fans into her stylish world as she divulges her inspiration, influences and top tips.

Set
to be published by Penguin Books, the book will feature the fashion 
muse's witty writing, quirky sketches and hand-picked photographs.

Â Whether on the red carpet, the front row or partying with pals, Alexa Chung nails it every time...

She never fails to pull off the effortlessly chic look

The famous Mulberry Alexa went on to make millions for the brand

The model shows off her endless legs in a pair of killer heels

As a regular red carpet goer, she always looks her best
