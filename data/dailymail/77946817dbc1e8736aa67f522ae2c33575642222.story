Tragedy: Brian Belfield, 63, pictured, died from hypothermia after falling down a mountainside during the gruelling Buttermere Sailbeck Fell Run in the Lake District in April last year

A 63-year-old fell runner died of hypothermia after he plunged 1,000ft in the Lake District after race officials lost count of the entrants, an inquest has heard.

Brian Belfield, 63, disappeared while competing in the gruelling Buttermere Sailbeck Fell Run on April 28, 2012.

But race officials only realised he had failed to finish the race when Mr Belfield’s wife Sandra, who was waiting for him at a guest house in Keswick, alerted them.

An inquest at Cockermouth Coroners 
Court heard a total of 133 runners entered the 9.5 mile race but a 
mix-up meant organisers assumed only 132 runners had taken part.

By
the time rescue crews began searching the mountainside weather 
conditions were too bad and his body was found the next morning.

Despite
falling down the mountainside, Mr Belfield suffered no broken bones but
died from exposure after landing in a freezing puddle.

Cumbria
Deputy Coroner Robert Chapman said: 'The post-mortem was clear in 
stating a number of cuts, bruises and abrasions to his body which 
indicated injuries from sliding rather than a fall.

'There
were no broken bones. It may be that he was unconscious which explains 
why he did not attempt to get out of the pool of water.'

The
inquest heard Mr Belfield - a member of Staffordshire Moorlands 
Athletics Club - had set off wearing a thermal top and also had a 
whistle and a compass.

Three runners abandoned the arduous mountain run, including one early withdrawal.

Race organiser Michael Robinson told the inquest he used his radio to tell marshals about the early withdrawal and then asked a spectator to relay the message to volunteer marshals at the fifth and final checkpoint.

He then went to the finishing line before heading off to organise the prize-giving while participants still crossed the line.

Mr Robinson said: 'With hindsight I think that with one dropping out so early the figure of 132 has stuck with some people.'

Mrs Belfield, from Leek, Staffordshire, attended the inquest with the couple’s children Tracy and Andrew. She said her husband had started running about 15 years ago.

She said: 'He always did it as a hobby and wasn’t one of the elite racers. The last time I saw him was about 11.40am when he went off to the race. I usually expected him back after about four hours but he never returned.'

The inquest continues.
