Three hand grenades were found in a bin at Walt Disney World in Florida last night.

A cleaner made the discovery when he was emptying trash containers at the Downtown Disney area around 7.30pm on Wednesday.

The area where the grenades were found was reported to be a staff-only parking lot at the shopping and entertainment district.

The grenades were moved to a second location for security reasons, but further investigation showed that the hand grenades were hollowed out and posed no threat, Orange Country Sheriff office told the Orlando Sentiel.

Disney spokeswoman Kathleen Prihoda told the paper there was minimal disruption to guests and that Downtown Disney was running as normal this morning.

Although it is still unclear how the grenades ended up in the bin, the casings are believed to be the kind used for training purposes, Jeff Williamson of Orange Country Sheriff's Office said.
