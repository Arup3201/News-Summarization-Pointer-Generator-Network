Con artist: Beijing ticket fraud mastermind Terence Shepherd has been given legal aid despite being a millionaire

A millionaire ticket tout who ripped off Olympic swimmer Rebecca Adlington's parents has been handed legal aid despite failing to pay back £1.3million he owes to his victims.

Terence Shepherd, 52, was jailed for eight years in 2011 for selling seats at the 2008 Beijing games that never existed.

The scam saw sports fans pay up to 48 times the price of Olympics tickets - but not a single one arrived.

The
 parents of gold medal-winning swimmer Rebecca Adlington were among 
victims from all over the world taken in by the ticket fraud, losing more than £1,000.

Shepherd was the mastermind behind the £5million fraud which fooled more than 10,000 customers.

After he was convicted he was ordered to pay back more than £1.25million, which is now £1.3million because it has never arrived.

But it emerged today he has been given a taxpayer-funded payout to finance an appeal against having his sentence extended for not paying the money back before the deadline of April last year.

The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) is trying to have up to six years added to his jail term.

Despite making attempts to claw back cash the SFO could not explain why it had not taken the £3million home he owns in exclusive Blackheath in south-east London.

Commons home affairs select committee chairman Keith Vaz told the Evening Standard that Shepherd was 'playing the system'.

'I am astonished that legal aid has been given to someone who appears to have gained vast wealth through nefarious activities,' he said.

'The Government must follow through on its commitment to end legal aid for wealthy defendants and ensure that those who have committed crimes pay the fines imposed.'

Valuable: Shepherd bought this £3million house in Blackheath but has still not paid back any money to his victims

Upset: Retired swimmer Rebecca Adlington's mother and father ordered a number of tickets for Beijing 2008 - which included some of their daughter's greatest moments in the pool - but they never arrived

His defence lawyer David Williams told a hearing at Westminster Magistrates Court that his family would clear his debt by selling three home and 'tables, chairs and paintings'.

Shepherd spent most of his money on a luxury life for him and his family.

Jailing him Judge Martin Beddoe told Shepherd: “It was a massive, cynical and an entirely dishonest trick, motivated solely by greed and executed as cynically as can be imagined.

'You, Terence Shepherd, clearly received the lion’s share. What you then got your hands on was blown on a catalogue of excess – luxury cars, foreign trips and the extraordinary expenditure of your wife.'

Margaret Canty-Shepherd was cleared of money-laundering, although she was said to have received almost £700,000 from one of her husband’s businesses.

The judge also made a point of saying in court that she had been one of the main beneficiaries of Shepherd’s fraud. Southwark Crown Court heard that in 18 months she spent £217,000 on luxury items, including jewellery and designer clothing, and £242,000 on travel.

They continue to live in a six-bedroom house in Blackheath, one of London’s most desirable suburbs.

The couple also regularly enjoyed holidays in Barbados and drove a fleet of expensive cars, including a Bentley, a Porsche and a Mercedes.

Prosecutor Marie-Claire Amuah said Shepherd must now provide evidence to show they will pay cash back and 'making a mockery' of the system. She added that they will demand his jail term is extended by several years unless the cash arrives.

The case was adjourned because Shepherd was unfit to travel because of an injured calf.
