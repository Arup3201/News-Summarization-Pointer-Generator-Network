A father and son are part of a group of seven Florida men accused of prostituting a 16-year-old girl and forcing her to have group sex while they plied her with drugs, prosecutors say.

The high school student was reported missing by her school and disappeared for a week while she was driven across Miami-Dade and told to earn $1,288 for the group, according to police.

The Miami Herald reports that the girl climbed into a black Ford Taurus with one woman and two men on December 4 after school.

She was then given alcohol, marijuana, cocaine and MDMA, an amphetamine-like synthetic drug with hallucinogenic effects.

She was coerced into sex acts with at least 16 men over the week she was missing, including two occasions where she was forced to have sex with up to 8 men at once, authorities said.

'Every time you think you have seen the worst of the worst, a case like this pops up,' State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle told NBC. 

'It's nauseating. It's horrifying and unspeakable,' she added. 'How human beings could be so barbaric to each other is a mystery to me.'

Police charged 43-year-old Derrick Powell, Sr, with sexual battery. The man's own son, 18-year-old Derrick Powell, Jr, was also charged with assault. 

Five other suspects, Craig Hill, Mark Evans, Branden Sands, Jerome Grace and Edward Cornelius, ranging from ages 24 to 42, are also in custody.

Pre-trial: At least one of the accused, Craig Hill, argued in a hearing that he was innocent of any connection to the crime

Prosecutors say the girl was located in Overtown a week after she was taken and taken immediately to the hospital.

The next morning, she identified the homes where she trafficked between, and police moved in to make arrests.

Several of the men have prior convictions, including manufacturing and sale of illegal drugs, according to Florida inmate records.

Police say the investigation is ongoing and are seeking the woman in the car and another man to question them about a possible connection to the crime.
