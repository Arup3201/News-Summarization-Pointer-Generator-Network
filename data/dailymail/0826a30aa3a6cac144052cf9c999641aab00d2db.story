Lens manager Antoine Kombouare's preparations for their return to Ligue 1 have been hit by a ban on signing new players.

The northern club finally had their promotion to the top-flight rubber-stamped on appeal after it was initially prevented - despite them finishing second in Ligue 2 last season - for failing to provide sufficient financial guarantees.

However, the decision has come with stringent financial sanctions from the National Directorate of Management Control (DNCG).

Up against it: Lens manager Antoine Kombouare is hampered by a transfer ban on his team

Lens confirmed on their official website that they are prohibited from adding to their squad until owner Hafiz Mammadov fulfils his commitment to inject funds into the club.

Former Aberdeen and Paris St Germain defender Kombouare took charge of the club last summer and led them back to the top flight after a three-year absence. 

They kick-off the new campaign with a trip to Nantes on Saturday night.
