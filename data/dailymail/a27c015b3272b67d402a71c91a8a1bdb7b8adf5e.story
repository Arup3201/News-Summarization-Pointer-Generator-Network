Maxine Ovenden, 39, accidentally overdosed on painkillers at her home in Ashford, Kent, after suffering constant pain from a gastric bypass operation (pictured after the surgery)

A woman left in agony for years after having a gastric bypass died after accidentally overdosing on painkillers, an inquest has heard.

Mother-of-one Maxine Ovenden, 39, spent most of her adult life battling her weight and had risen to 25 stone.

Five years ago she underwent weight-loss surgery on the NHS and virtually halved her weight to 13 stone.

But she suffered persistent agonising pains and medical staff struggled to diagnose what was wrong.

She was found dead at her home in Ashford, Kent by her mother shortly before her 40th birthday last January - having taken an accidental overdose of painkillers.  

Her GP Dr Edward Klim told a coroner that Maxine had suffered from nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain since the gastric bypass.

She underwent numerous tests and procedures in an attempt to find out what was causing the problems and was due to undergo an operation for an overlapped bowel.

Her mother Dawn Sharp, 59, told the inquest in Folkestone, Kent, she believed Maxine’s death was an accident.

She said: 'I think it was accidental. I think she just took one too many. She must have woken up, got the time wrong and taken one more.'

The inquest heard Maxine had struggled with an alcohol problem and had been diagnosed with clinical depression, but had stopped drinking.

In August last year she had fallen between 25ft and 30ft from a balcony onto a road, fracturing a bone in her face among other injuries.

But Rachel Redman, coroner for central and South East Kent, accepted that she had started to 'take more responsibility for her life' since her fall.

Before recording a verdict of accident death, Mrs Redman said Maxine was 'off the alcohol' and had 'everything to live for'.

After the inquest Mrs Sharp, also from Ashford, said she wished her daughter had never gone under the knife.

'She had a gastric bypass and she was never right again' she said. 

'It has to be something related to the gastric bypass. She was never in pain before that.'

The mother-of-one, pictured left just after finishing school and right when she was aged 11, had suffered constant nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain following the gastric bypass operation

'I wish she’d never had it. I wish doctors had said this is it and told her to go to the gym three times a week and you cut down food, but they didn’t.'

She added: 'She always told me she’d rather be fat and happy than thin and unhappy. But I think when you’re big people are abusive sometimes, people get on at you.'

Mrs Sharp said her daughter was turning her life around when she died.

She said: 'She was nearly 40. She’d had a bad run up until then but her life had turned around and she was on the up.

'We’d booked a holiday, she’d moved to a much better area and was taking her daily exercise. She was on the up.'
