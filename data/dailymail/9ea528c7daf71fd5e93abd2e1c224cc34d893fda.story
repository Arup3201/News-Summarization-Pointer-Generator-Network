Founder: American entrepreneur Natalie Massenet set up British fashion chain Net-A-Porter

Internet shopping firm Net-A-Porter last night became the latest corporate giant to be accused of dodging tax.

The British fashion chain raked in sales of £435million in the year to March 2013 – but posted a loss of £24.7million, according to Channel 4 News.

The report claimed that Net-A-Porter used clever planning to pay a fraction of the tax you would expect it to, by turning profits into a loss.

It was claimed the loss was created in part by the way the company chose to reward its senior executives through shares.

Net-A-Porter is also able to use the losses it makes to reduce its future tax bill, according to the report. Tax experts said that from the firm’s accounts it was very difficult to see what was really going on.

Richard Murphy, of Tax Research UK, said: ‘In this particular company’s case, we don’t know where it’s making its profits, we don’t know where it’s paying its tax.

'We don’t actually even know it’s paying its tax because there is no cash flow statement in these accounts because there is a Swiss parent company.’

He said this means Net-A-Porter doesn’t have to include information ‘to tell us if this tax, which it says it owes, is even being passed over to the revenue’.

Mr Murphy added: ‘We’re still living in a world where there’s an enormous amount of opacity that a company like this can exploit to leave us in doubt about what is going on.’

Labour MP John Cryer, a former member of the Treasury select committee, said: ‘I think it stinks. This company is getting away with not paying what they should be paying. HMRC should pull their finger out and have a look at exactly how this system works.

The scheme allegedly used by Net-A-Porter is perfectly legal, but will raise eyebrows among UK taxpayers. Net-A-Porter told Channel 4 its accounts 'fully reflect the company's business within the UK'

‘HMRC, in my experience, are a little bit too easy on big companies with lots of money.’

The scheme allegedly used by Net-A-Porter is perfectly legal, but will raise eyebrows among UK taxpayers.

Net-A-Porter told MailOnline its accounts ‘fully reflect the company’s business within the UK’.

A spokesman said: 'The Net-A-Porter Group is fully liable for UK Corporation Tax on the results of these UK operations.

'It is not a publicly listed company and its parent, Richemont, does not comment on the financial performance of individual businesses within the Group‎.'
