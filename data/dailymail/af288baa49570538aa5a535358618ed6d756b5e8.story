It is hard to know what was most disturbing for Tottenham: four games without a win, successive home defeats without scoring, another flat performance after Europe or the sight of Mauricio Pochettino assuming the 'AVB crouch'.

Pochettino had been through the full repertoire. He yelled and screamed and pointed and stamped his feet. He tried to regroup at half-time and made ambitious substitutions in an attempt to jolt his team into life.

In the end, none of it worked and the Argentine sank down onto his haunches as Andre Villas-Boas was prone to do as he watched from the same technical area, perhaps engulfed by the same feeling of helplessness.

Unfortunately, the view from ground level was no more appealing for a Spurs boss fast approaching his first North London derby, at Arsenal, on Saturday evening. West Bromwich deserved their first victory of the season and their first at White Hart Lane since 1984.

They were solid at the back, industrious, inventive and created enough chances to have scored many more before James Morrison appeared unmarked at a corner to nod in the game's only goal, in the 74th minute.

'I am angry and disappointed,' fumed Pochettino. 'I don't know the best word to show my feelings. We were wrong in the way we played. West Brom arrived here with only two points and last in the table but we need to show respect.

'At the beginning of the game we were too slow, we moved the ball too slowly. We need to play quicker. We need to show more. There was a lack of movement. We showed nerves. You need to be aggressive. The way we played brought risk into the game.'

The game after a Europa League fixture can often be a good time to play Spurs. They lost six out of 12, last season, and were sluggish, even though there were 10 changes and only Hugo Lloris remained from the team which started against Partizan Belgrade in Serbia on Thursday. 'It's not an excuse,' said Pochettino.

Tottenham were especially vulnerable defending corners, which they were forced to do regularly as Vlad Chiriches conceded several in his determination to over-complicate things in tight defensive areas.

Craig Dawson headed over from the first of the day and Joleon Lescott, impressive on his debut, his first game in six months, caught a half-volley sweetly on the turn which seemed destined for the roof of the net until it smashed into Dawson's head.

Lloris kept out Craig Gardener's fizzing drive after a short corner routine and the visitors had a strong appeal for a penalty rejected, also corner. Dawson met Morrison's set-piece with a diving header, glancing the ball towards goal only to see it blocked by an outstretched hand belonging to Emmanuel Adebayor.

Referee Kevin Friend waved the appeals aside. He also ruled out a goal by Saido Berahino for offside, although on this occasion, the officials got it right. Berahino was a yard offside.

Discontent rumbled around White Hart Lane and anxiety gripped Spurs. Not only were they vulnerable at the back but they failed to create anything of note going forward. Seventy minutes had passed before they registered an effort on goal, when Ben Foster saved at the near post from sub Roberto Soldado.

'There was a moment mid-way through the first-half when the mood changed after we had a period of possession and pressure,' said Irvine. 'That can spread around the ground. We've experienced it at home. The fans respond to what they see.'

Lloris kept his team in the game. There was a fine save to keep out a swerving effort from Berahino after the young striker skipped past Chiriches, and another to thwart Morrison, but he was finally beaten.

Appropriately it came from a corner. It was taken by Chris Brunt from in front of the Albion fans who booed him during a home defeat by Everton, and converted by Morrison, who is not the tallest of players but escaped the attention of Erik Lamela to nod in.

Tottenham mustered a late flurry but West Brom hung on without fuss. Having arrived rock bottom of the Premier League, they left with their first win of the Premier League season and a weight hoisted from their shoulders as they prepare for home games against Hull, in the Capital One Cup, and Burnley.

'I'd be lying if I said there wasn't an element of relief,' said Irvine. 'But the over-riding emotion is real pleasure, for players, club as a whole and for our fans. It's great to get that first win.'
