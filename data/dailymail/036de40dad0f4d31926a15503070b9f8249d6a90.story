A naked rampage in California has left residents of an apartment complex in shock after a bare man ran around their parking lot at night and smashed headfirst into vehicles.

Clarisa Vidrio of Anaheim told KTLA News that she spotted 21-year-old Garrett Smith sprinting towards the trunk of her neighbor's van around 11:30pm on Saturday before he bounced off and did a backwards somersault.

Distressed by the scene, she quickly got into her car and attempted to drive off, but a bloodied Smith erratically jumped on her bonnet.

Vidrio sped up in a state of panic and dethroned the unclothed rider by bumping into a parked van.

'I saw the guy flying off the car... I literally thought I was going to die that day,' she recalled.

Proving her observations, a surveillance camera caught the unusual incident unfold.

Footage released, shows Smith getting up and wearily crouching over after he was hit.

Another resident from the apartment complex then goes over to greet him before he starts running again.

The witness described the scene as 'something beyond his imagination.'

Stephen Trinkle, who also spotted Smith, told CBS News he was covered in sweat and blood.

'To take that much pain and then get up and take off again, it's just bizarre,' Trinkle added.

Vidrio, who first saw Smith, immediately called 911 after she managed to get him off her car.

Smith was arrested a mile away and taken to hospital with multiple injuries. 

He now faces charges of vandalism, being under the influence and resisting arrest.

Denise Bustillos, another witness, concluded: 'It was a shocking thing. I think it affected all of us on the complex.'

Vidrio's car was left seriously damaged as a result of Smith's naked rampage with her windshield shattered and bumper in tatters. 

She also bulldozed a neighbor's fence as she quickly pulled away. 

The van Smith plowed into was  left with dents.

'When our neighbor told me the story... I didn’t believe her at first,' said Charlie Barnes, who owns the crumpled vehicle.
