Wiggle: A baby girl dressed up as Cabbage Patch Kid wearing Amanda's wig

A fan of the iconic Cabbage Patch Kid toys has taken her obsession to the next level by making her own versions of the dolls’ woollen tresses.

Amanda Lillie, 32, has created a range of crocheted wigs so fans of the dolls can dress up like iconic child's toy.

After finding a similar doll-wig online she dug out her old collection of Cabbage Patch Kids and began creating her own.

The original dolls were created in 1978 and had soft cloth bodies and hair made from wool.

It became one of the most popular toys of the 1980s and is one of the longest running doll-franchises in the U.S.

Amanda
 uses an acrylic version to create her wigs, which she makes in all 
shapes and sizes to fit both children and adult doll enthusiasts, each 
one taking around two hours to complete.

Amanda, from Georgia in the U.S., said: ‘Cabbage Patch Kid dolls were very popular throughout my childhood in the eighties.

‘I had many dolls growing up, and I purchased my last doll when I was 16 years old.

‘I began crocheting several years 
ago, and in August last year I saw a photo online where someone created a
 version of the crochet Cabbage Patch wig for a toddler.

‘The
 hat did not look like a Cabbage Patch Kid at all, it had stringy bangs 
and the pigtail were entirely too short, I knew I could create a much 
more authentic looking wig.

‘So
 I pulled out my old dolls for inspiration and I set to work creating a 
pattern with loopy bangs, similar to what all of my dolls had, and with 
longer bunched pig tails with ribbons.

‘I was successful on my first attempt and with Halloween soon approaching I put it up for sale on my Etsy shop.

‘I
 was surprised to find that there was a tremendous amount of interest in
 my hats.

'Since then I have sold dozens of custom made hats for newborns
 all the way through adults.’
