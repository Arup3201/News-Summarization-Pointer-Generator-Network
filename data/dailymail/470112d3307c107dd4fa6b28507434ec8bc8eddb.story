A man who turned his antebellum Mississippi home into a quirky Elvis Presley shrine was found dead Thursday on the front porch, two days after police said he killed a man who broke into the museum.

Paul MacLeod, 71, was spotted slumped in a chair outside the cluttered museum known as Graceland Too, said Marshall County Coroner James Richard Anderson. The man’s body showed no signs of trauma.

‘It appears to be natural causes but it is pending until we get the autopsy,’ Anderson said.

MacLeod's death comes two days after police say he killed Dwight Taylor, 28, at the 1850s home that doubled as a makeshift exhibition space.

The homeowner was questioned by police, but no charges were filed. MacLeod attorney Phillip Knecht said Taylor forced his way inside, demanded money, and the two men fought before the shooting.

According to MacLeod's attorney, the 71-year-old museum owner heard someone banging on the front door at around 11pm Tuesday.

When he went to answer, the stranger forced his way inside and demanded cash, The Daily Journal reported.

McLeod tried to shut the door, but the suspect, Dwight Taylor, stuck his foot inside the house. 

That is when police say the septuagenarian pulled out his gun and fired a single .45 caliber bullet to Taylor's chest, killing him.

What a character: With his silver hair worn in 1950s slicked-back do, MacLeod has been a well-known persona in the Jackson area, his makeshift museum drawing visitors from around the world

The museum is located in Holly Springs, in the kudzu-covered hills of north Mississippi -about halfway between Presley's birthplace in Tupelo and his final home and resting place at the Graceland mansion in Memphis, Tennessee.

Graceland Too - which is not affiliated with Graceland or the Presley estate - became a pilgrimage for superfans.

Visitors could arrive at any hour of the day or night, pay $5 and get a tour from the hyper-caffeinated MacLeod, who said in 2009 that he drank 24 cans of Coca-Cola a day.

Wearing his thinning silver hair in a perpetual 1950s slicked-back do, he would tap on visitors' arms as he pointed out items in his floor-to-ceiling hodgepodge of photos, records, knickknacks, cardboard cutouts, clocks and other random kitsch featuring Elvis.

‘My ex-wife told me, “Make up your mind. 
Either me or the Elvis collection.” So that put an end to that,' 
MacLeod, who named his son after the King of Rock `n' Roll, told The 
Associated Press in late 2009.

Local institution: Visiting Graceland Too was a rite of passage for students from the University of Mississippi

Health concerns: MacLeod once boasted that he drank 24 cans of Coca Cola a day; he is survived by his son

Mr MacLeod owned his home since the 1970s and said he started opening it to tourists in the late 1980s or early 1990s. Graceland Too attracted international tourists, and visiting there was a rite of passage for students from the University of Mississippi.

Willie Carter, of McComb, said Thursday he toured Graceland Too five times while he was a student at Ole Miss. Like many others, he'd go with a group of friends around 2am.

‘It was extremely weird,’ Carter said. ‘You just went with it. He seemed to have a real love for Elvis and all things Elvis. You could tell he was sincere.’

Floors would creak beneath visitors' feet. Doorways were decorated with several Elvis-patterned curtains in `70s-era hues of turquoise and lime. There were stacks of papers and magazines and

MacLeod kept photocopies of a newspaper with his favorite headline: ‘Elvis Presley Excites Girls, Scares Critics.’
