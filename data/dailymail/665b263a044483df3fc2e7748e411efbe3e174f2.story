The former bodyguard for Princess Diana has hit out against a new play suggesting that Prince Harry's real father is James Hewitt - but says that the prince will not care about the speculation.

The West End production, believed to be endorsed by Mr Hewitt himself, has drawn criticism for its support of the rumours surrounding Harry's paternity, as well as a claim that Diana was pregnant at the time of her death.

The princess' ex-minder, Ken Wharfe, has described the play Truth, Lies, Diana as 'tasteless', adding that there is no evidence to back up the allegations made by the production, which opened in London last Friday.

Claims: A new play suggests that Prince Harry, left, is the son of former cavalry officer James Hewitt, right

Affair: The production claims Princess Diana began a relationship with Hewitt 18 months before Harry's birth

However, he said that Harry 'won't give a monkeys' about the repetition of claims that former cavalry officer Hewitt is his real father.

'Hewitt, actually, prior to this play has gone on record to say Harry isn't his son,' Mr Wharfe told the Daily Mirror. 'Harry knows exactly who he is and he's heard all this before.

'He won't give a monkeys about the play and won't see it. He will laugh it all off.'

Rubbished: Bodyguard Ken Wharfe says that Prince Harry will not be concerned by the fresh speculation

The play, which was written by Jon Conway and is currently on at the Charing Cross Theatre, claims that Hewitt and Diana began seeing each other 18 months before the princess' second son was born in 1984.

In one scene, the actor playing Hewitt says: 'Diana and I started our relationship more than a year before Harry was born. Now that doesn't prove that I am his father. It's just the inconvenient truth.'

Hewitt has previously insisted that his affair with Diana started in 1986 - but he is friends with Mr Conway, and when asked about the play said he is 'sure that it is accurate'.

The production also uses a notorious photograph of Prince Harry naked in a Las Vegas hotel room taken in 2012 - comparing it with a nude picture of Hewitt to reinforce the link between the two men.

Mr Wharfe - who guarded Diana for seven years and later wrote a controversial memoir - told the Mirror: 'James Hewitt was captured naked, then 20-odd years later they tried to tie it up with Prince Harry in a hotel room in Las Vegas.

'What's the connection? Well there is no connection. It's totally tasteless, it has no relevance to this play at all.'

Mr Conway told the Mail last year that he had spoken to Hewitt while researching the play, adding: 'I met him and he told me some quite remarkable things that have never been said in the public domain, particularly about when his relationship with Diana started.

'There is a startling revelation that James Hewitt makes and he has allowed me to make it in the play. This is the fact that his relationship with Diana started 18 months before Prince Harry was born.'

Guard: Mr Wharfe is shown with Diana and her two sons as they left a restaurant together in April 1993

Allegation: The play also claims that Diana was pregnant with the baby of her lover Dodi Al-Fayed, pictured with the princess on the night of their death 

Theories: The new play is currently on at the Charing Cross Theatre in London's West End 

He continued: 'We are not saying he is Prince Harry's father although the audience may take their own view on that. I don’t know if James Hewitt is Prince Harry's father and James Hewitt has always denied it either because it isn't true or out of some sense of loyalty.'

Another extraordinary claim aired in Truth, Lies, Diana concerns the rumour that the princess was pregnant by her lover Dodi Al-Fayed at the time of the couple's death in a Paris car crash in 1997.

A post-mortem examination showed that this was not the case - but in the play, a witness describes hearing one doctor being told that Diana had lost a baby in the crash which claimed her life.

A scene shows the doctor on the phone saying, 'What? She was pregnant?' - then telling another character: 'Imagine that, the King of England's mother, pregnant with a Muslim baby.'

Royal experts have rubbished the explosive claims made by the play, pointing out that there is no evidence to support them.

Biographer Penny Junor told the Mail last year: 'I have spoken to people around at the time and they all say that James Hewitt wasn't in the picture before 1986.'

And author Hugo Vickers added: 'If you talk to certain people you will get a version of events these people are keen to peddle. They have an agenda of their own.'
