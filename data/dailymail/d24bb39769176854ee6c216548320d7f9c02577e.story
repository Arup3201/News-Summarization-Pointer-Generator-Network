A North Carolina hospital took the groundbreaking decision to let a dog into the operating theater yesterday as it's seven-year-old owner underwent life-saving surgery.

First-grader Kaelyn Krawczyk has a rare illness called mastocytosis which causes dangerous allergy-like symptoms - such as hives, swelling, nausea and shortness of breath - to occur without warning.

Her pet terrier, JJ, is trained to detect oncoming attacks and on Wednesday when she was operated on at the Duke University Medical Center the fluffy pooch acted as an 'additional monitor' for medics.

A girl's best friend: Duke University Medical Center in North Carolina decided to let JJ the dog into the operating theater yesterday as it's seven-year-old owner, Kaelyn Krawczyk, underwent life-saving surgery

Turning in circles indicates a mild reaction while barking shows the situation has become more urgent. Resreachers believe that medical response dogs such as JJ, can detect subtle changes in body chemistry or behavior in their owner.

Anesthetist, Dr. Brad Taicher, told the Charlotte Observer: 'It was kind of logical, actually. Knowing what JJ could do, we realized that [she] was not much different from other monitors we use.'

'It sounds silly, in this age of technology but this little dog  was more sensitive than all the machines'

While JJ couldn’t be allowed into a 
sterile operating room, she could go into a less strict procedure zone. 
She was given a thorough bath on Tuesday evening in preparation for her 
hospital visit.

The purpose of Wednesday's 45-minute-long operation was to look for a cause of Kaelyn's recurring kidney infections, which, if left untreated, could prove fatal.

Early Wednesday, JJ followed the youngster into the surgery and sat on the floor next to her bed.

Dr Taicher says anesthesia can, in rare 
cases, cause an allergic reaction in patients, so he watched for any 
signs from JJ as the sedative was administered to Kaelyn.

Though the monitors showed no change in 
her vital signs, JJ got up and turned circles as her body felt the 
effects of the drug - a minor alert - and then sat back down.

Dr. Sherry 
Ross, who performed Kaelyn's surgery said the injection of a 'test dye' 
during the procedure could have also triggered a reaction. But, again, 
no problems occurred.

The only other instance JJ stirred was as Kaelyn was brought out of sedation, and she turned a couple of circles again.

'Knowing what JJ the dog could do, we realized that she was not much different from other monitors we use'

'It was just as we expected,' Dt Taicher said. 'If we had had a script, she followed it to a tee.'

Although service dogs are used in many medical instances, including detecting blood-sugar fluctuations in diabetics and seizures in people with epilepsy, Dr Taicher said he was impressed with JJ’s abilities.

'It sounds silly, in this age of technology, when we have millions of dollars’ worth of equipment beeping around me, that we had a little dog who was more sensitive than all the machines,' he said.

Since JJ became Kaelyn’s service dog 18 months ago, she has exceeded the hopes of even her trainer, Deb Cunningham at Eyes Ears Nose and Paws in Carrboro.

Ms Cunningham knew it was possible to train a dog to help when a person goes into medical distress but she wasn’t sure a dog could learn to alert someone of something happening at a cellular level before the person even shows signs of a problem.

Grateful: Kaelyn's mother, Michelle, says JJ makes life a lot easier

In 2012, Ms Cunningham trained JJ, a who was rescued from an animal shelter, about how to react to Kaelyn's condition.

Previously
 the infant from Apex, North Carolina, experienced three to four severe 
reactions a year but since JJ entered her life there has been only one.

That’s because JJ alerts before the reaction progresses, giving Kaelyn’s parents time to take action. Her mother, Michelle, says the dog often senses a problem before Kaelyn shows any symptoms or says that she's feeling unwell.

'JJ has made it possible for us to give out daughter a more normal life'

As
 well as signaling that there is some wrong, JJ can also go to a cabinet
 at the family’s home and fetch a kit containing an EpiPen in 
preparation.

If the Krawczyk’s are away from home traveling, she knows to go to Michelle’s purse and get the kit.

'JJ
 has made it possible for us to give [Kaelyn] a more normal life,' 
Michelle said. Meanwhile her daughter calls JJ 'very beautiful and 
smart' and at 'the top of my love list.'

Kaelyn is currently 
recovering from yesterday's procedure. It is very unusual to have a dog 
present in a hospital operation room.

Indeed, Dr. Timothy E. Smith, 
an associate professor of pediatric anesthesiology at Wake Forest 
Baptist Medical Center in North Carolina told Today.com that he had 
never heard of such a case.
