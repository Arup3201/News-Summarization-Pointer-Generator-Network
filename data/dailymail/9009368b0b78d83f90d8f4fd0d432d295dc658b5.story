Devin Hester set an NFL record with his 20th return for a touchdown, breaking the mark he shared with Deion Sanders.

Hester returned a punt 56 yards for a touchdown midway through the second quarter to give the Atlanta Falcons a stunning 35-0 lead over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

He took the punt at his own 44, found a seam up the middle, and zipped around the last man who had a shot at him, punter Michael Koenen. 

Hester high-stepped the last 20 yards or so, a hand behind his ear - the move that Sanders made famous during his Hall of Fame career.

Sanders, now a television analyst, was covering the game and watched his record fall at the Georgia Dome, which he once proclaimed 'is my house.'
