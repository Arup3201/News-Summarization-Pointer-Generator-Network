A toddler was found wandering the streets of London without shoes after he walked out of his nursery - where it is claimed staff hadn't noticed he was gone.

Some parents have vowed to boycott the Oak Tree Nursery in East Dulwich after a driver stopped and picked up Romeo Chudasama in the middle of the road.

The nursery reported the incident to Ofsted and vowed to conduct a full review - but the boy's mother said she was furious.

Two-year-old Romeo Chudasama has been reunited with his mother Rekha, right, after being found wandering the streets of London by passer-by Louise Tarrant after he walked out of his nursery

Romeo’s mother Rekha, a 39-year-old bus driver, told the Evening Standard she has not taken her son back since.

'I
 know accidents happen,' she said. 'If my son had hurt himself while at nursery, I 
would have dealt with it. He is a very active child and very outgoing, 
and he loves jumping around.

'But I can’t forgive them for letting a child go for a walk in the road.'

She told ITV's London Tonight programme that her son now attends a different nursery.

She said: 'You leave your child in the care of a nursery, you would expect your child to be kept safe at all times, at any given moment.

'I just imagined the worst.'

Romeo was found by passing motorist Louise Tarrant, who picked him up and knocked on doors of houses along the street before returning him to the nursery 50 metres away.

Ms Tarrant said the nursery didn't seem that concerned when she returned the youngster to them.

She told ITV: 'He was running in the middle of the road with no shoes on. I was completely shocked.

'I picked him up and he didn’t talk or anything. I was knocking on the doors asking: “does anyone recognise this little boy?”

'There didn’t seem much concern [from the nursery].'

The incident on Thursday last week came to light after Romeo's mother wrote about it on the East Dulwich Forum website.

'This
 is not the first time!' she claimed on the forum. 'Ofsted and Southwark
 Council are involved in this too. The police were also informed.

'My son was found in the road and by a 
member of the public. It seems the nursery were unaware he was missing 
until he was returned.'

Speaking at the nursery today, a woman who described herself as the manager but would not give her name told MailOnline: 'There were things in the reports that weren't true but we don't want to comment further.

'Our statement is that the nursery's priority is the safety of the children in our care.

'The minute the incident occurred we took initial steps to notify the regulatory body and secure the main entrance of the building.

'We're going to undertake a full review with Ofsted.'

The nursery's last Ofsted report in 2012 described it as 'well-established' with 22 children on the roll, all sharing access to an outdoor play area.

The report rated it as good, adding: 'Good systems are in place to help safeguard children and promote their welfare.

'Staff have attended safeguarding training and have appropriate policies in place.

'This ensures they are able to take prompt action if they have any concerns regarding children's welfare.'

But other parents on the East Dulwich Forum complained about standards at the nursery in recent months.

One wrote: 'I was very happy with it until he went back in the New Year. The second Monday after New Year I dropped him off and found the door to be wide open and none of the staff near it.

'I went in and the nursery was very chaotic. When I picked him up after lunch the door was wide open again with no staff to be seen.'

Another parent added: 'I removed my child before Easter as I wasn't happy about things - seemed too chaotic and badly run.'

Southwark Council described the incident as 'very worrying' and said it had supported the family in finding an alternative nursery.

A council spokesperson said: 'Ofsted is responsible for regulating and inspecting private nurseries.

'However, this incident is clearly very worrying for local parents and we are working with the nursery to help them improve their safety policies and procedures.

'The council has also been supporting the family concerned to find alternative childcare provision for their son.'

The incident comes after a three-year-old boy escaped from Juneberries Day Nursery in Romford, Essex, earlier this month.

He wandered onto a busy dual carriageway and was only rescued when a woman motorist and her daughter spotted him.

The Romford nursery was temporarily closed as Ofsted, Havering Council and the police launched a joint inquiry.
