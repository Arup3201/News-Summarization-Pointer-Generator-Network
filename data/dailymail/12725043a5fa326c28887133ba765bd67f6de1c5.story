With a pram parked by the door, and toys littering the garden, it looks for all the world like the home of a busy family with two young children.

But the country house where Peaches Geldof once lived has reportedly lain uninhabited since the mother-of-two's body was discovered in an upstairs bedroom after overdosing on heroin.

The £1 million property, in Wrotham, Kent, appears to have remained largely untouched after the journalist and presenter's death in April, and her widower, Tom Cohen, is said to have never returned to their marital home.

By the gate, post and leaflets are scattered across the ground. The house in Kent was much loved by Peaches before her death, and the mother-of-two often tweeted pictures of her and her children going about their daily lives at the home

Miss Geldof's home is not believed to be for sale, but Mr Cohen is said to be staying with their children Astala, two, and Phaedra, one, at his parents' home in South East London. 

It was Mr Cohen who discovered his wife's body at the home they shared, after he returned from a weekend away on April 7.

An inquest in July heard that Peaches - daughter of late TV presenter Paula Yates and musician Bob Geldof - had started using heroin again in February, after taking the substitute drug methadone for two and a half years.

Coroner Roger Hatch said she took a fatal dose of high-purity heroin shortly before she was found dead. At the time of the tragedy Kent Police said the death was ‘sudden’ and ‘unexplained’.

But her husband told the inquest he had seen Peaches flushing drugs she had hidden in the loft of their home down the toilet.

Coroner Roger Hatch said Peaches took a fatal dose of high-purity heroin shortly before she was found dead. He said the young mother had been trying to wean herself off drugs and had been clean months before her death but had relapsed

Mr Cohen was seen pushing his youngest son in a buggy in London. He is said to be living back a his mother and father's house 

 

He found her body when he returned from a weekend away with the couple’s two-year-old son, Astala. 

Their one-year-old son Phaedra was in the house with his mother.

Mr Hatch said the young mother had been trying to wean herself off drugs and had been clean months before her death but had relapsed.

Mr Geldof said he blames himself for the death of Peaches, adding that he ‘goes over and over and over’ what he could have done to help her after she started using the drug again in the months leading up to her death.

He described the journalist, model and television presenter as ‘super bright’ but ‘frantic’. 

MailOnline has contacted Mr Cohen and Mr Geldof for comment.
