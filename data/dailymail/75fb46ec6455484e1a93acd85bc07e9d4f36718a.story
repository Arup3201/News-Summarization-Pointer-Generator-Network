Whether she's going high-fashion in a Balmain campaign or popping out to the shops, Kim Kardashian never fails to look flawless.

But you can guarantee the 33-year-old didn't roll out of bed looking that good.

Indeed, the world famous reality TV star and fashion icon has a glam squad on hand 24 hours a day to help her look immaculate. One key cog in Kim's well-oiled machine is her make-up artist and old friend, Mario Dedivanovic.

Kim Kardashian's make-up artist has shared his latest techniques for giving the star her flawless glow

Mario, who was the man that made sure she was picture-perfect for her and Kanye West's nuptials last year, has shared his latest tips and tricks behind perfecting Kim's contoured look. 

Speaking to Grazia Middle East, Mario shared his top tips for defining Kim's eyes, creating a flawless base and revealed how he gives her those glossy lips.

He explained that to play up the drama of Kim's eyes, he uses a darker shade along her eye crease and a really light one to highlight her brow bone.

Kim apparently loves wearing golden hues along her bottom lash and he uses liquid eyeliner 'winged up and out' to complete the look.

Mario Dedivanovic met Kim on a make-up shoot in New York over five years ago and they've been working together ever since

Although she's one of the globe's wealthiest stars who could have her pick of the most high-end products, Kim is happiest when Mario uses drugstore brands.

To give her lashes volume, he sweeps on two coats of L'Oreal Voluminous Mascara in Carbon Black.

Revealing the key secret behind her famously contoured cheekbones, Mario says he swears by Giella Eye M Glam Highlighter - a sheer highlighting powder he created for the brand.

He claims it gives you the most gorgeous, natural golden glow thanks to the  pure and natural mineral pigments that diffuse light and make the skin look more luminous. 

The multi-purpose product, which costs £23 ($35), can be used on the inner corners of eyes to separate and brighten them, on the brow bone to highlight and lift. It can also be mixed with moisturiser for all-over glow and mixed with water for a stronger application around the eyes. 

While you can use his product anywhere - even on the body - he is adamant that application is key.

'Always use a beauty blender sponge to blend in the layers of the product,' he advises. 'I apply some along her cheek bones to give a dewy effect, on the bridge of her nose and Cupid's bow and I also sweep it along her decolletage, shoulders and arms,' he added.

If that wasn't enough contouring, he also applies it to the inner corners of her eyes to 'brighten and open' them.

He likes to user higher-end products to play up Kim's lips, opting for nude tones by Lancome finished with a slick of gloss in a similar hue.

'To keep Kim looking fresh from day to evening, I use TATCHA Blotting Papers, which keep the skin from getting muddy in the heat,' he concludes.

Mario, who met Kim on a make-up shoot in New York more than five years ago, said despite the global audience at Kim's wedding in 2014, he wasn't nervous about the very important role he played in her wedding.
