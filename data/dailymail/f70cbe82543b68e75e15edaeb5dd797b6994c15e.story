Plans to allow gay marriage could be voted on and approved by MPs within weeks, it emerged last night.

David Cameron and Nick Clegg have agreed to fast-track the controversial change in the law – bringing it before Parliament in the New Year.

A Tory grassroots campaign of opposition to gay marriage has been gathering momentum in recent weeks and the move will be seen as an attempt by Mr Cameron to ‘lance the boil’.

Previously, Number Ten had said only that same sex civil marriage would be introduced at some point before the next election in 2015

Proposed legislation was not included in the last Queen’s Speech – which sets out the legislative programme for the year ahead – adding to the impression the new law is being hurried.

The move will alarm the significant numbers of Conservative MPs, including some ministers, who have indicated that they are fundamentally opposed to the idea.

But even if, as expected, dozens of Tory MPs refuse to back the plans, they look certain to be passed into law with the support of Labour and the Lib Dems.

Labour leader Ed Miliband has suggested the Government should go even further than proposed, and allow gay marriages in church.

With this ring: Cameron and Clegg have both spoken in support of gay marriage, but some MPs, including ministers, oppose the proposed change in the law

The proposal is also being fiercely opposed by some senior church figures – presenting the new Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, with a fresh dilemma after the Church’s unexpected rejection of women bishops.

He has hinted at a softening of the Church’s stance on homosexual partnerships after promising to re-examine his own traditional views, but would face a fierce internal battle if he decided to back the Government.

The Government has received 228,000 responses to its consultation on allowing gay civil marriage – more than any other issue under the Coalition.

Civil partnerships, introduced in 2005, already give gay couples similar legal rights to married couples. But the Government wants them to be legally allowed to make marriage vows.

Ministers have vowed to protect churches and other religious groups, insisting claims from opponents that they might be forced to conduct gay marriage ceremonies once civil weddings are allowed because of human rights laws are incorrect.

But some faith groups, including Quakers and liberal Jews, have suggested they want to host services.

One senior source said: ‘The Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister have agreed to get on with it. It was in danger of slipping beyond the general election.

‘David Cameron’s view of this is: “get it done and get it done quickly”. If we are going to do this it’s better to make it happen rather than have it hanging. If people want to commit to each other, he believes that’s a foundation of a stable society.’

The Prime Minister is to appease Tory critics of the plan to legalise gay marriage by offering a free vote on the issue as a ‘matter of conscience’.

In a significant concession which will dismay the Liberal Democrats, Number Ten sources say the PM believes Conservative MPs should not be whipped to vote in favour. The Lib Dems are expected to instruct their MPs to back the legislation, and if Labour does the same it seems certain to become law.

However, if significant numbers of Tories vote against, Mr Cameron may face the embarrassment of the plans making it into law thanks to the backing of opposition MPs.

Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Paterson has already indicated that he will break ranks by opposing gay marriage.

Choice: Churches and other places of worship will not be forced to hold same-sex weddings under the plans

The Prime Minister threw his weight behind the proposals in a speech to the 2011 Tory party conference.

Defending the measures he said at the time: ‘Conservatives believe in the ties that bind us; that society is stronger when we make vows to each other and support each other.’

Chancellor George Osborne said last week he was ‘proud’ to be part of a Government that planned to introduce a law to redefine marriage and claimed that a ‘clear majority’ of the public backed a change.

However, a ComRes poll published this week suggested 62 per cent of voters and 68 per cent of Tories believe marriage should continue to be defined as a ‘life-long exclusive commitment between a man and a woman’.

The incoming Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has underlined his support for the Church’s opposition to gay marriage. But he added: ‘I know I need to listen very attentively to the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender communities, and examine my own thinking prayerfully and carefully.’
