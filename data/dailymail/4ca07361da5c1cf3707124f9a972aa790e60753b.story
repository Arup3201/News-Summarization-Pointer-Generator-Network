Manny Pacquiao says Floyd Mayweather has been set a deadline of the end of January to sign-off their $200million super-fight, but admitted he’s in the dark as to whether it will ever happen.

The Filipino has already agreed terms for the most eagerly-awaited fight in boxing which has been penciled in for May 2 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.

But Mayweather has yet to commit to a bout that has been more than five years in the making.

'My promoter and I, we've already agreed to the terms and conditions of whatever he wants,' Pacquiao told the Los Angeles Times. 'We're just waiting on the signed contract from him. I don't have an idea [if it will happen].

'We just want to make that fight happen - for the sake of the fans, for the sake of the millions of people around the world who are excited to see that fight.

'I just want to prove who's really No 1. If the fight is on and he beats me, I'm really convinced he is No 1. If not, I'm No 1.'

Pacquiao said he had a deadline of the end of this month for Mayweather to put pen to paper before he would move on to other targets, which could include Bolton's Amir Khan.

As well as the date and venue, a drug testing programme is believed to have been agreed. The remaining issues include how to broadcast the show jointly on HBO and Showtime.

The last time the networks agreed to do so was for Lennox Lewis vs Mike Tyson in 2002.

Further doubt was cast on the fight taking place when talks between Miguel Cotto and Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez broke down.

Mayweather could opt to instead face a rematch with Cotto, three years after convincingly outpointing the Puerto Rican.
