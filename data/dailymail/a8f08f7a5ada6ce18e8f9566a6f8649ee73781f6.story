There were more tears than usual as a father walked his daughter down the aisle in what appeared to be a traditional wedding ceremony in Kentucky in June.

That's because there was no groom, just a tender moment shared by Whitney Moore and her father David Moore, who has just months to live after being diagnosed with terminal cancer last year.

Knowing her beloved dad won't be around when she eventually marries, Whitney Moore wanted to create the memory of the joyous occasion with her beloved father.

Father and daughter walked down the aisle arm in arm, Whitney dressed in a long white gown carrying a bouquet of pink and white flowers, her dad dapper in a suit and pink bow tie.

The Kingsport Times News reports that the pair read special messages they had written to one another as they stood under a white arch.

David Moore gave his little girl a ring engraved with the word 'sugar,' his nickname for his daughter.

He also gave a ring to Logan Moore, Whitney's younger brother, who served as ringbearer.

The emotional father and daughter then shared a first dance to 'Daddy Dance with Me,' which was captured in a touching photo that Whitney posted to her Instagram account.

She wrote that she'll 'cherish forever' the memories she has of that day with her dad.

'In my future I may love a man a lot, and some day I will marry him, but in the end let me remind you that no matter what happens, I'll love you and you will always be the best man I know. I promise you that I will always be your little girl.'

The Moore family has struggled with the tragic news of David's impending death since doctors told him he had terminal liver cancer in October 2013.

'Since my dad was diagnosed with his cancer at stage IV, it really, you know, hit me,' Whitney Moore told the Times News.

'I questioned it. I got mad. I questioned God and I got mad at God. I was just wondering why it had to be my dad. But everything happens for a reason.'

Father and daughter both realized time was of the essence and, inspired by the story of 11-year-old Josie Zetz whose cancer-stricken dad walked her down the aisle in a ceremony earlier this year, planned the event.

David Moore also wants to fish off a pier with his son Logan before he dies. They're planning to spend the day doing just that on August 10.
