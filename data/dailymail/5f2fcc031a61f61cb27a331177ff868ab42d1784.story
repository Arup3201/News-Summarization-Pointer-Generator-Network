Britney Spears' new beau Charles Ebersol is not only Dad approved, he was Dad selected.

The pop star's 'dadager' and conservator Jamie Spears knows that reality TV producer Charles Ebersol is no gold digger. 'Charlie had to pass the dad test for sure,' a long-time business friend of Jamie's  tells MailOnline exclusively. 'And Charlie had to pass legal muster, too, with that mob of lawyers that run her world.'

Lest we forget, Britney's finances, and her personal life, are still in the hands of conservator lawyers, who can pretty much say 'yay' or 'nay' to anyone if they want. Lucky for Britney, 32, her family's matchmaking track record isn't too shabby.

All business: Dadager Jamie Spears has a hand in all things Britney. He introduced her to now ex boyfriend David Locado and kicked him to the curb when he cheated on his daughter

Britney's big brother Bryan introduced his sister to Jason Trawick in late 2007 at a sushi restaurant at the top of Beverly Glen, California. That that affair lasted more than two years. 

Dad Jamie found David Locado when they met in Britney's Westwood lawyers' offices. That relationship played out for 18 months, after they first kissed on Valentine's Day 2013. 

Both men were rumored to have cheated on the pop diva. 

'When Jamie found out David was cheating on his daughter, the guy was kicked to the curb so fast, it would make your head spin. Jamie doesn't give second chances.' 

Enter the handsome Charlie Ebersol, 31, son of former NBC Sports chief Dick Ebersol. And not a moment too soon.

'Britney functions best with a man in her life, and Jamie knows that. He's is good at selecting just the right candidates. They last a while. That's all anyone can ask, really. Britney has a complicated life.' 

'It took less than a month for Jamie to find Charlie. He eyeballed him from a distance at first. But after a few meetings together, Jamie knew he'd found a good guy.' 

All dad had to do from there was get them together in a subtle way. 'Jamie had to do this stuff slowly and cautiously, so Britney wouldn't rebel. He had to make it seem like it was her idea to date Charlie, and not the other way around or it wouldn't work.'

 In early September, after accepting a business 'pitch' meeting with Ebersol, who co-founded the reality TV production house 'The Company,' it became clear to Mr. Spears that the young entrepreneur should be high up on the short list. 

'Charlie is very much like Britney. They make a good couple. He was born privileged. He gets the game. He gets her lifestyle. He gets her. They're both about the same height, if that matters. And they are both a little out of touch with the cost of bread. 

'They've been rich from a very young age. They live that world.' 

Charlie is the son of TV executive Dick Ebersol and Kate & Allie star Susan St. James. 

'They were raised the same, in the Industry,' revealed the insider. 'Big emphasis on family and giving back to charities, that sort of stuff. That's what Jamie loves about him.

'Charlie's an okay guy. He isn't out to screw anybody. He saved his dad from a burning plane wreck, for chrissakes. What more could you want?' 

On November 28, 2004, a private plane crashed carrying Dick Ebersol, Charlie and brother Teddy, 14, who died in the accident.

Initially, Jamie met Ebersol from across a conference table. The TV show producer was pitching Team Spears an idea for a reality show starring Britney. 'The concept sounded good to Jamie, and I guess it seems that as the meetings advanced, Britney was brought in to meet Charlie.

'Lo and behold there was chemistry there. This was a couple of months ago now. So Jamie sat on that idea of a reality show.' 

'You have to remember, Britney gets pitched these things 50 times a day. But Jamie liked the idea of her going out into the world and doing good. She's really so naturally generous. To a fault, really. And so is Charlie.'

Sources suggest the Britney's reality show would peg her as a philanthropist, rather than a chart topper. Each episode would follow Britney finding new ways to give money or services to people or give back to a community.

 'Jamie likes the idea. And so does Britney. It puts her out of her comfort zone of playing mom and rock star and into the role of giving to those in need.' 

And with each subsequent meeting, one thing led to another. Pretty soon, Charlie and Britney were moving from the board room into the dining room. 'There were a few 'dinner' meetings. They were getting to know each other.' 

Meanwhile, Jamie maintained a strict leash on his ward. Britney can date, surely. But Edan Yemini, Britney's bodyguard of more than six years, always must be waiting nearby. Whether at the restaurant's bar observing, or in an SUV idling out front, Britney's guards are charged with never leaving her alone. 

And despite Britney's public acknowledgment of their union on Wednesday at a Las Vegas press conference, there was still no official word on the reality show. Last Wednesday was dubbed 'Britney Day' in Las Vegas, when the Toxic singer accepted the 'Key to the Las Vegas Strip.' the divorced mother-of-two seized the opportunity to tell Extra that she and Ebersol were an official couple.

 'Yes, there is a special someone' she told the news outlet. Britney continues her concert residency at Planet Hollywood with newly-added show dates for 'Britney Spears: Piece of Me' through 2016. 'Charlie's seen her show like six times. It takes 20 minutes by private plane from Van Nuys, so there won't be any long-distance relationship issues, like there were with Jason.' (Jason traveled with his clients Taylor Swift, Hilary Duff and Paris Hilton which ticked off Brit to no end) 

And as a possible jump start to her philanthropic TV persona, Britney announced that every ticket purchased for her show, one dollar will go toward the Nevada Childhood Cancer Foundation.

However, the singer and mother of Jayden and Sean has remained optimistic about finding Mr Right. 

'I'd like to have more kids, settle down ... have kids – maybe twins – and get married,' she said last year. 'That would be nice.'

Hear that, Charlie?
