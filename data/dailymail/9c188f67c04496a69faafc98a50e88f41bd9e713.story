Manchester United have received a major boost in their efforts to sign Oscar Borg after the highly-rated youngster rejected a contract at West Ham.

The winger has been on trial with the Old Trafford club over the last couple of weeks, playing in a friendly game for the Under 18 side against Trafford last week.

He has also travelled with United’s youngsters to compete in the Milk Cup in Ireland, starting both of the club’s games so far.

In good company: Borg has been compared to Real Madrid winger Gareth Bale

Sportsmail understands that he has turned down the opportunity to sign professional terms with east London club and favours a move to United. There is also considerable interest from other clubs, however.

Borg, a left-sided winger or full-back has been compared to Gareth Bale due to his floppy hairstyle and direct approach down the left-flank.

He would be available for just a nominal fee, thought to be in the region of a £250,000 in compensation as he has not been signed up a scholar, despite emerging through the club’s famed academy system.

The 16-year-old completed his GCSE’s at the John Fisher School in Surrey this summer and is now understood to be considering a life-changing move to Manchester.

West Ham confirmed that Borg is training at United with the club’s knowledge but declined to comment on his contract situation.

Another triallist, Watford’s young striker Ogo Obi, has also been invited by United to the Milk Cup and has impressed at the competition in Ireland.
