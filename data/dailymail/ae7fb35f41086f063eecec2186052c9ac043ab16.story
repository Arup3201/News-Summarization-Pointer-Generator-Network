History buff: Carolyn Ekins cooked ration recipes for years before plunging into WWII life

Carolyn Ekins recalls the day her mother-in-law revealed the highlight of  her wartime childhood. ‘The weekly treat for her and her sister was sharing one fried egg,’ she says. ‘I thought: “Wow, how did you cope?” ’

Carolyn’s interest was more than merely academic. A history buff, she had been cooking ration recipes for fun for many years, and knew that the frugal wartime regime had actually left the population healthier — despite the food shortages — than it had ever been before.

‘There was a huge team of people at the Ministry of Health during the war working on healthy recipes that contained loads of vegetables,’ she says.

‘That’s what really captured my imagination that you could live on a lot less and feel good on it. It struck me that living on Forties rations might be an interesting way to lose weight and save money.’

The social media administrator from Nottingham had fought a losing battle with her weight for many years. At her heaviest, she tipped the scales at almost 25st.

‘Everyone has a crutch they can rely on and mine has been food,’ she says. ‘I’m an emotional eater.’

A series of family traumas, including separation from her husband, had led her eating habits to spiral out of control until she worried for her own wellbeing.

‘I had a racing pulse, I was sweating, my back was hurting,’ she says. And as a single mother to three children, Jess, now 25, Josh, 21, and Emily, 16, she felt a responsibility to look after her health.

And so she embarked on a year-long ration diet. The results were extraordinary. In 12 months, Carolyn lost 5st 10 lb, getting her weight down to 15st 9 lb.

Numerous diets had failed her. ‘Slimfast, WeightWatchers, Slimming World, I tried them all,’ she says. ‘I had some success, but none captured my imagination. And I didn’t like relying on processed food full of preservatives.’

So in place of the diet meal replacement bars and milkshakes she had previously relied on, she began to feed herself and her family on mock apricot tart made with carrots and Lord Woolton Pie.

Shock: Carolyn, pictured before her weight loss, used to eat several pounds of cheese a week

¿I had a racing pulse,' she said. 'I was sweating, my back was hurting.' And as a single mother to three children, Jess, now 25, Josh, 21, and Emily, 16, she felt a responsibility to look after her health, Carolyn said

The latter, named after the Minister of Food who popularised the recipe, involved dicing and cooking potatoes or parsnips, cauliflower, swede, carrots and turnip. Rolled oats and chopped spring onions were added to the thickened vegetable water, which was poured over the vegetables.

The dish was then topped with potato pastry and grated cheese and served with vegetable gravy. Haute cuisine it certainly wasn’t, as Carolyn discovered.

‘The first two or three weeks or rationing was like going cold turkey,’ she says. ‘To begin with, I felt it was really bland, but after a week or two I began to appreciate it because my palate had changed.’

The portion sizes were another shock. After all, the weekly ration of four slices of bacon and 2oz of butter wouldn’t see many of us through a single breakfast.

‘I used to eat pounds of cheese a week, but the ration was as much as you’d have on one generous slice of cheese on toast. It made me realise how much I’d been consuming,’ says Carolyn.

As well as the bacon or ham and 
butter, a weekly adult ration allowed for the equivalent of two small 
meat chops, 2oz of cheese, 4oz of margarine, 4oz of cooking fat and 
three pints of milk.

It also included 8oz of sugar, 2oz of tea and one whole egg or one packet of dried eggs every four weeks, along with 12oz of sweets.

Every two months, a pound of preserves was added. Families would also have bread, oats, fruit and vegetables, and a monthly points allowance could be used to buy foods that were in short supply. The maximum 16 points would buy one can of fish, 2 lb of dried fruit or 8 lb of split peas.

Carolyn estimates her calorie intake decreased from around 5,000 a day to a far healthier 2,000. Not only this, her meals were packed with vitamins and goodness. She was eating so many vegetables that she rarely felt hungry. 

Her lifestyle became healthier in other ways, too. Realising that the wartime housewife would have taken far more exercise than she did, she tried to mimic the effects of petrol rationing by walking up to three miles a day.

Meanwhile, the demands of whipping up something tasty from the available rations meant she had to give up TV in the evenings to spend her time on her feet cooking.

‘It was labour-intensive, cooking everything from scratch in a wartime way,’ she says. ‘I tried to be authentic, so I used wooden spoons rather than a blender.’

Tasty: Unlike traditional diets the recipes were not all salads - these spam fritters, for example

Back in the comfort zone: Some of the more reassuring recipes included these spam sandwiches

Her recipes were sourced from the internet, and she also found old pamphlets and Marguerite Patten’s cookery books for inspiration.

Her children grew accustomed to the strange smells emanating from their mother’s kitchen.

‘They loved the Anzac biscuits, made from oats and desiccated coconut, and the carrot cookies — but anything that involved Spam or curry didn’t go down well,’ she says.

‘What I mostly did was to slip vegetables into cakes without telling them, because if I’d said I was doing apricot flan made from carrots they wouldn’t touch it with a barge pole.’

The fake banana sandwiches, made from over-cooked parsnips mashed up with banana essence and golden syrup, weren’t popular either — ‘though Emily swallowed a few mouthfuls before she realised and her face contorted into a priceless expression of horror!’

Carolyn’s personal sticking point was powdered egg — ‘It does the job, but I’d advise you not to stick your nose in the packet’ — and a carrot curry she attempted.

‘That was revolting,’ she says.  ‘It just tasted like carrots and  curry powder.’

For Christmas dinner, she served up cake with mock marzipan (flour, margarine, sugar and almond essence), eggless Christmas pudding and Mock Duck made from sausage meat (vegan in her case, as she is vegetarian).

Her children participated by hand-making the decorations.

By October 2012, at the end of her experiment in living history, Carolyn was amazed by her huge weight-loss.

And what’s more, she found she had saved almost £3,000 in the same time by giving up takeaway coffee, processed food and sandwiches in favour of home-cooked rations.

‘I could feed myself on £1 to £2 a day. It made a significant difference,’ she says. ‘Before my ration diet, I was spending between £5 and £10 a day on food and coffee.’

But since returning to her normal diet 18 months ago, Carolyn has seen the weight piling on again. Now she is back to over 20st, so once more, she’s dusting off the old pamphlets and recreating wartime delicacies in the hopes of shedding 7st.

So far, she’s whipped up eggless pancakes for Shrove Tuesday and dished up her favourite recipe, Lord Woolton Pie, more than once.

‘I make it most weeks and it’s fantastic,’ she says. And after just three weeks back on the World War II diet, she’s already lost 12 lb.

There’s no doubt that rationing helped us win the war. But perhaps 70 years on, we should once again be eating for victory — this time to win the battle of the bulge.
