Reggae Reggae sauce millionaire Levi Roots left a former lover 'skint' after borrowing money to fund his business plan and not paying her back, a court has heard.

Mr Roots, who shot to fame on TV's Dragons Den, met writer Anita Flowers when she paid him to do talks at the Performing Rights Society.

At the time he was planning to launch the sauce, and was 'looking for' £5,000 to fund the project, it was said.

She gave him the money and the sauce later went on to be a huge success - but he failed to pay her back, the court heard.

The 53-year-old reggae singer and entrepreneur is being sued by old friend, Tony Bailey, 52, who claims Mr Roots stole his secret recipe and took it on Dragons Den in 2007.

Mr Roots won a £50,000 investment from 'Dragons' Peter Jones and Richard Farleigh, and the famous franchise is now worth millions.

He is also being sued by financial advisor Sylvester Williams, who claims he, Mr Bailey and Mr Roots had an agreement to go in to business together, when Mr Roots cut them out and went it alone by appearing on the show.

The court heard how before he shot to fame on the hit BBC 2 show, Mr Roots is said to have borrowed cash from Welsh author Ms Flowers, who wrote Masking the Madness.

The pair became lovers after meeting, and Mr Roots asked Ms Flowers to invest the money as part of his plan to cut his business partners out, it is alleged.

But Ian Glen, QC, acting for Mr Bailey, claims he never paid her back and leaving her 'skint' and unable to afford a train fare to London.

Mr Glen said: 'You were looking for £5,000 and wandering in to your life was a woman who could provide £5,000.

'She gave you £5,000 for this business and she was skint by the time the bowl came round wasn't she, because you took what she had. She said she couldn't afford to come to London.'

Mr Roots replied: 'I don't think the proposed £5,000 was all her money. She came to the carnival.

'Ms Flowers made it quite plain that she fancied me. I was doing the sauce at the time.'

Mr Glen asked: 'Did you repay her?'

Mr Roots replied: 'Yes.'

Ms Flowers previously gave evidence claiming that she had received no money from her former lover since his business took off.

An expert witness, advisor to the food industry Vince Craig, told the court Mr Bailey's recipe was 'commercially unusable' as it was too vague and designed to be made on a domestic scale.

Mr Roots claims he created the sauce from a basic jerk sauce recipe, before experimenting with adding and removing ingredients until he arrived at Reggae Reggae sauce and didn't use Mr Bailey's list of ingredients, which Mr Bailey claims is the basis of Reggae Reggae.

Company director of Meadowbrae Technical Services Limited Mr Craig cooked both Mr Bailey's sauce and Mr Roots' from the original recipes.

Giving evidence at the High Court yesterday, Mr Craig said: 'It [Mr Bailey's] was commercially unusable. I had to make a number of assumptions due to the differing numbers on the recipe.

'I had to make a guess at which all purpose seasoning was used because it didn't specify.

'That was challenging. I had to take a guess as to consistency as there was no indication of that on the instructions.

'The sauce that I attempted to make I found thinner in consistency, slightly lighter in colour, harsher to the mouth, so when you put it in your mouth it hit you very hard, very quickly on the front end of your tongue and back of your mouth.

'The Reggae Reggae sauce is slightly darker, thicker and you enjoy the pleasure of the fruitiness of the tomatoes first before you get the heat that comes in at the second stage.'

Mr Bailey and Mr Williams are suing Mr Roots for a third share each in the sales of Reggae Reggae sauce, thought to be more than £300,000 a piece.

The claim breach of confidence, over the sauce recipe, and breach of contract.

Mr Roots denies their claims, saying he came up with the sauce from a basic Jerk Sauce recipe, and that Mr Bailey had 'no interest' in the commercial marketing of the Reggae Reggae Sauce.

He also insists Mr Williams was due to provide £5,000 finance - but never did, so he decided to go it alone, and by the time he appeared on Dragons Den, both were history.

The hearing continues.
