A drunken single mother who killed two football fans in a car crash after taking a cocktail of lager and cocaine has been jailed for four years.

Terri-Ann Harrington, 27, was twice the legal limit for driving when she lost control of her silver Renault Clio and crashed into a garden.

Her two passengers Stoke City fans Martin Wilson, 26, and 20-year old James Morgan who were friends of Harrington were killed instantly in the impact.

But despite being responsible for the accident Harrington, who has a five year old daughter, left the bodies of two men in the wreckage and staggered off down the road.

She was found lying unconscious in the road a short time afterwards near a pub.

Tests later showed she had both cocaine and opiates in her system.

It also emerged that at the time the crash occurred Harrington, from Bentilee, near Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs, had already been warned by judges she faced an 'early death' to her regular misuse of Class A narcotics including heroin.

Stoke Crown Court was told on the evening before the crash last November she went for a family meal before visiting several pubs with ex-partner Mr Wilson and his friend Mr Morgan.

She had then driven them to a friend’s home, and then onto James’s mother’s house.

The car was travelling through the Lightwood area of Stoke in the early hours when it veered out of control and overturned landing in a residential garden.

Harrington told police she had drunk just three halves of lager, and claimed to have hit a patch of black ice on the road.

But blood tests revealed she would probably have had a blood alcohol content of 183-microgrammes of alcohol per 100-millilitres of blood at the time of the crash - more than twice the legal limit.

Crash investigators found the road would not have been icy, and no mechanical defects were found in Harrington’s Renault.

Harrington, who has a string of previous convictions for burglary and theft, later carried out a series of thefts in the weeks after the crash - including a shoplifting expedition on the day of her two victim’s funerals.

She pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving whilst under the influence, was banned from driving for two years and ordered to take a retest.

Jailing her Judge David Fletcher forced her to confront the horror of her actions that night.

He said: 'You walked away. Let’s face it, you walked away leaving your friends dead.'

Harrington's lawyer Peter McCartney said the his client could not recall why she lost control of her car.

He said: 'She has struggled to come to terms with the deaths of her friends, and the guilt of being responsible for it. She continually has nightmares where she goes back to what happened.

'Miss Harrington has a daughter who turned six last Saturday. She knows she is going to prison, while her daughter is not.'

The four year jail term will be consecutive to a 15-month sentence imposed on Harrington in January for a series of offences carried out in the weeks after the crash including handling stolen goods, theft, possession of cannabis, criminal damage, having a bladed article and three charges of failing to surrender to bail.

Guilty: Harrington's lawyer said she had 'struggled' to come to terms with the death of her friends but could not remember how she lost control of the car

In 2008 she was given drug rehabilitation treatment following previous offences including the burglary of a vicarage.

At the time another judge warned her: 'It is a very narrow window of opportunity for you.

'If you go back to your old ways, effectively that will be the end of your life. If you get back into drugs you will have an early death.'

In statement at the time of the crash Stephen Bell, Mr Morgan's former deputy headteacher at Painsley Catholic College said: 'James was a pleasant and popular member of the school.

'He was always polite and was very likeable. He worked hard and the other students thought a great deal of him, as did the staff.'

His older sister, Sara Morgan, added: 'James truly was amazing and influenced so many people’s lives. He was my little brother and I loved him.'

Mr Wilson's uncle Andrew Milton paid tribute to his nephew saying: 'Martin was loved by many, we will all miss him. I still can’t believe it.'
