Franck Ribery has admitted he is p***** off with his continual injury problems.

The Bayern Munich winger missed Wednesday's 1-0 win over Manchester City in the Champions League with a knee problem. 

And the 31-year-old has also admitted he is not sure when he will be back in action. 

'This really p*sses me off. It is very annoying,' Ribery told Kicker. 'I don't know yet how long I will be out of action.' 

Franck Ribery has been struggling with injuries for much of the summer and the start of the season

Ribery missed this summer's World Cup due to a back problem and then picked up a knee injury that saw him sidelined for the start of the season.

He scored after coming off the bench on his return to action in Bayern's 2-0 win over Stuttgart on the weekend. But his knee problem flared up again, ruling him out of the City clash.  

Ribery was a key player in Bayern's treble success in 2013, making 39 appearances in all competitions last season, but has played just 23 minutes of football this season.
