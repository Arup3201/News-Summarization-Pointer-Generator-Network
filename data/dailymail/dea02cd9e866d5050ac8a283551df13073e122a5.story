A soldier who swallowed two live goldfish as a NekNominate dare has been warned he could face jail or a £20,000 fine.

The RSPCA expressed outrage yesterday as it was revealed that the paratrooper placed the fish in a pint of Foster’s and downed the concoction.

James Steel, who served as a pallbearer at Margaret Thatcher’s funeral last year, said he regurgitated the fish afterwards and claims they are unharmed.

Proud: Dressed in a pink swimming costume  Lance Corporal James Steel holds up a glass containing goldfish before adding beer and downing his pint in a NekNominate stunt. He has been criticised by the RSPCA

Important role: L/Cpl Steel (pictured second left) was a pallbearer at Margaret Thatcher's funeral last year

In a video of his stunt for the online
 drinking craze which has already claimed four lives, the Lance Corporal
 wears a pink swimsuit with a fake moustache and beard and drops the two
 fish, who he calls Steve and Tom, into the pint.

After drinking it he attempts to be sick in the bath and nominates two friends to outdo him.

He adds: ‘P.S. Been fishing and I can’t get them up.’

The 25-year-old apologised for taking up the ‘stupid’ dare but insisted: ‘The fish did survive. I got them back up and gave them to my girlfriend
 and she now has them in a bowl. I decided to do it that way because I 
thought it was funny.’

L/Cpl
 Steel, who was recently promoted and has served in Afghanistan, said he
 deserves to have a private life outside the forces.

‘I have an impeccable career as a soldier but I’m also a human being,’ he said. ‘I don’t walk around in my uniform all day.

‘I was just doing what the rest of the country is doing.’

From
 the family home in Ripon, North Yorkshire, his father Gary said he was 
extremely proud of his ‘high-flier’ son for carrying Mrs Thatcher’s 
coffin last April but now finds his behaviour concerning.

‘I worry about him more when he’s not in Afghanistan,’ he added.

At
 the weekend, two young men died after taking part in NekNomiate 
challenges. The craze has also claimed the lives of two young men in 
Ireland.

The RSPCA 
criticised Steel’s stunt and said it has been inundated with calls from 
people concerned about using animals in such a way.

A
 spokesman said: ‘We would like to remind people that this is not a 
light-hearted joke or entertainment, it is cruel and unacceptable.

‘You
 could be prosecuted under the Animal Welfare Act and could face up to 
six months in prison and/or a £20,000 fine.

'We want to send a clear 
message to people that animal cruelty is never OK, even if it is in the 
guise of “entertainment”.’

He appealed to anyone with information on other NekNominate animal cruelty to report them.

The Ministry of Defence said: ‘We are aware of the incident.’
