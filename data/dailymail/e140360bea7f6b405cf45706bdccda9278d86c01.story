A judge has banned app-based taxi company Uber from operating in Spain, following similar actions in countries around the world.

Spanish phone companies have been ordered to block the Uber app while the court examines a case brought by the Madrid Taxi Association, the capital's court services said. 

Yesterday, Uber was banned from the Indian capital New Delhi, after one of their drivers allegedly raped a customer. 

App-based taxi service Uber has been banned from Spain after a court ruled their drivers carry out activities that 'constitutes unfair competition' and lack the 'administrative authorisation' to drive taxis in Madrid

The court ruled that Uber drivers in Madrid carry out activities that 'constitutes unfair competition', the services said in a statement.

They also accused drivers hired through the app of  'lacking the administrative authorisation to carry out the job.'

The ruling was a 'cautionary measure' adopted while the court examines a case brought by the Madrid Taxi Association, the service said in a statement. 

Founded in 2009 in California, Uber is best known for its smartphone app that connects passengers with local drivers, and the company then  charges a commission for each ride.

When a journey is complete, customers are invited to 'rate' the driver on a five-star system, and the driver can do the same with the customer. 

Taking action: Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has promised to help police with criminal drivers

The company said last week it was valued at £25.5billion ($40 billion), a double in market value in six months.

Uber is now present in more than 200 cities across 45 countries, but that is set to decrease if the bans continue.

Dutch judges on Monday banned one of Uber's services, UberPOP, from taking bookings via its smartphone app and threatened the company with fines of up to 100,000 euros ($123,000), saying unlicensed drivers were breaking the law.

A defiant Uber reacted in a statement by saying it 'will continue to offer UberPOP.'

Monday's decision 'is simply the first step in a long-running judicial battle,' the San Francisco-based company added.

A court in Paris is due to decide on Friday whether Uber's services constitute unfair competition to traditional taxi drivers.

Authorities in Denmark and Norway have also filed complaints against Uber.

In Germany, a court in Frankfurt threw out an injunction against Uber in September. Uber was able to resume operating legally in Germany pending a final ruling on a complaint by the taxi federation.

The city government in New Delhi on Monday banned Uber from operating in the Indian capital after a passenger accused one of its drivers of rape. 

Shiv Kumar Yadav, 32, is expected to be charged with raping the finance company employee on Friday night. He was hired to ferry her home from a dinner engagement.

Police said they were considering legal action against Uber for failing to run background checks after it emerged the suspect was arrested for raping a woman three years ago but was later acquitted. 

Uber said there were no defined rules in India on background checks for commercial transport licences and it was working with the government to address the issue.

'What happened over the weekend in New Delhi is horrific,' Travis Kalanick, Uber's chief executive officer, said in a statement. 'We will do everything, I repeat, everything to help bring this perpetrator to justice.'
