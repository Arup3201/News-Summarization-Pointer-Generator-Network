About 140 pilot whales that stranded themselves on a remote stretch of New Zealand beach have died, after the creatures initially became stranded on Friday. 

Tragic scenes show the carcasses of the whales half-submerged and stretched out along kilometres of the Farewell Spit on the northern tip of New Zealand's South Island.

Conservation workers and volunteers are hoping the remaining 60 or so will survive after they managed to get them refloated and back out to sea.

The stranding of the 198 whales on Friday was one of the largest in recent years and prompted 80 workers and volunteers to help out.

The geography of Farewell Spit on the South Island seems to work against whales, which regularly become stranded there.  

By late Saturday, 140 of the whales had died, said Department of Conservation area manager Andrew Lamason. 

He said the workers and volunteers worked throughout the day to keep the surviving whales watered and covered before refloating them during Saturday night's high tide.

'We've had a really good crew of volunteers, and people have been wanting to come from all over the country,' Mr Lamason revealed.

He also said the surviving whales had moved to deeper water. But he cautioned that while hopes for their survival were high, whales had been refloated in the past only to return and get stranded again.

Experts said the scale of the stranding has been tough on the helpers, both physically and emotionally

Mr Lamason said the scale of the stranding has been tough on the helpers, both physically and emotionally.

'It's very sad, they're very intelligent animals,' he said. 'The pragmatic view is that it's part of nature.'

The focus will now turn to the dead whales, and the enormous task of dealing with the carcasses, Lamason said, adding that while in the past helpers have typically buried them in the sand, he's not sure what the approach will be this time.

He said the department had been experimenting with tethering or moving carcasses into the water, which has the advantage of providing food for other sea creatures.

Experts describe Farewell Spit, located on the northwest corner of the South Island, as a whale trap due to the way its shallow waters seem to confuse whales and diminish their ability to navigate.

On Saturday authorities expressed concern for the remaining whales as weather conditions proved too warm for the animals,The New Zealand Herald reports.

A first attempt to re-float the whales during high tide at about 5pm failed, with many whales becoming re-stranded. 

Mr Lamason asked the public to leave the rescue to trained volunteers, most of whom are from the community group Project Jonah, due to the risks involved in refloating operations.

However, he estimated up to 500 volunteers would be needed to keep the whales cool and wet until the next high tide on Saturday.

'We'll just keep on trying,' Mr Lamason told the New Zealand Herald.

'Re-floating stranded whales is a difficult and potentially dangerous job, so it's important we have the right people on the ground tonight trying to get these whales back to safety,' he said on Friday.

However, he added that there was a possibility the whales would need to be euthanized if they remained stranded.

Stranded whales can become dehydrated quickly, suffer sunburns and can die from their own weight crushing their organs. 

The stranded pod, which includes many young whales as well as adults, are beached up to 6km up the shoreline.

'It's like a hapu or a village. It's a whole mixed family group,' Mr Lamason said.

The reason that whales become stranded is not completely understood, however it is considered a natural phenomenon. 

'Possibly the leader is sick or disoriented and the herd simply follows the leader or a young whale may strand by accident and the rest of the herd try to come to the rescue,' the DoC's website states.

'They may run into problems when the shoreline is gently sloping; sand and mud absorb the sonar signals they use for navigation, giving a false indication of deeper water.'

Mr Lamason said the shallow hook-like nature of the beach was likely to have influenced the event.

'People should bring buckets, spades and old sheets. A bus will be put on from Triangle Flat at the base of Farewell Spit. People need to be prepared with sunscreen, hats, water, food and warm clothing if they want to assist,' he said of Saturday's operation.
