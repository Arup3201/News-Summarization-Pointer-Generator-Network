The bodies of at least 220 tribesmen have been found in Iraq after militants from the Islamic State exacted bloody revenge on Sunni leaders who have been organising resistance movements against them.

More than 150 members of the Sunni Albu Nimr tribe were found in a mass grave near Ramadi in Anbar province this morning, while the corpses of another 48 members were discovered near Hit.

In a further frightening development ISIS militants massacred 30 men in broad daylight in the centre of Hit, which is also in Anbar, parading them through the streets and using loudspeakers to declare them apostates.

The murdered men were thought to be local tribesmen who had allied with the Iraqi government and were helping to organise anti-ISIS operations throughout the province.

Massacre: Young men use mobile phones to take pictures of the dead bodies inside Hit yesterday afternoon

The bodies of 150 members of the Albu Nimr tribe were discovered after ISIS militants took the men from their villages to the city of Ramadi.

Police and security officials say they discovered the mass grave outside the city this morning, with the indication being the militants shot them dead yesterday evening.

In a separate case, witnesses said they found 48 bodies belonging to members of the same Albu Nimr tribe near the town of Hit, roughly 50 miles north west of Ramadi.

Describing the event a witness  said: 'Early this morning we found those corpses and we have been told by some Islamic State militants that "those people are from Sahwa, who fought your brothers the Islamic State, and this is the punishment of anybody fighting Islamic State".'

The man spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing for his own safety.

Grisly: The Islamic State extremists are understoog to have lined the men up and shot them dead with rifles

Tribal sheikhs from Albu Nimr say both groups of victims were among more than 300 men aged between 18 and 55 who were seized by Islamic State this week.

The previous morning Islamic State militants had shot dead 30 members of the tribe in the centre of Hit.

The slayings took place on a main street in al-Bakir district of the town, which has been the scene of intense fighting by jihadis and local resistance groups in recent weeks.

The militants first paraded the men through town, shouting through loudspeakers that the captured men were apostates who fought against them, residents said. 

The extremists then lined up the men and shot them dead with assault rifles, residents said.

The Anbar faction of ISIS is led by Abu Waheeb (centre) whose notoriety stems from the filmed murder of a group of Syrian lorry drivers in Iraq last summer. His band of militants are known as the 'Al Anbar Lions'

A photograph showed a line of the men's bodies by a small pool of blood as onlookers walked by.

Anbar provincial council chairman, Sabah Karhout, said the Sunnis killed were tribal fighters allied with the government and members of the security forces.

The men were captured when ISIS terrorists overran the town, which sits on the Euphrates river and is located about 85 miles west of the Iraqi capital.

Karhout called the slayings 'a crime against humanity' and demanded more international support for the Sunni tribes fighting the militants in Anbar province.

A harrowing video has emerged showing the charred and dismembered bodies of up to 75 people killed when a Syrian regime helicopter dropped two barrel bombs on a refugee camp yesterday.

The graphic footage - filmed at a displaced persons camp in the northern province of Idlib - shows the bloodied corpses of women and children, while passers-by scramble to save the wounded.

'It's a massacre of refugees,' a voice off camera can be heard saying, while tents that act as makeshift homes burn all around him and dazed children wander the camp looking for relatives.

Barrel bombs, which are banned by international law, are crudely made containers filled with nails, metal shrapnel and explosive material that are dropped from low altitude.

The video begins with the cameraman racing up to the bombed camp on a motorcycle and finding a scene of total devastation. 

'Let the whole world see this, they are displaced people. Look at them, they are civilians, displaced civilians. They fled the bombardment,' he said.

The man runs into the camp and screams at others to pick up the bodies, trying to convince them that the people on the ground with limbs missing might still survive if taken to hospital.

'This one's good! This one's good!' he shouts, telling two men to carry a limp body with one leg hanging from strips of flesh to a nearby pickup truck. 

'Pick him up from the stomach not the leg,' he screams.

A man in another video of the Abedin camp, which houses people who had escaped fighting in neighbouring Hama province, said as many as 75 people had died.

Syrian state media did not mention the bombing. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which tracks violence in the civil war, said it heard reports that 10 civilians had been killed.

Details of the attack could not be independently confirmed. 

Human rights groups say the Assad regime has previously dropped barrel bombs on densely populated neighbourhoods.

These acts are in defiance of a U.N. Security Council resolution banning their use.
