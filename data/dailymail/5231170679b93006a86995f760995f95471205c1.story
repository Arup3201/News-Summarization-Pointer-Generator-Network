If you've ever played with Scalextric, you'll know the frustration of hitting the 'throttle' too hard and sending the cars veering off the track.

In what's been dubbed 'Scalextric for the 21st century', a new game attempts to solve this problem by keeping cars on track using sensors and cameras.

And in an even more modern twist, the cars are controlled by an app meaning racers can throw virtual weapons, obstacles and even stop their opponents, as seen in games such as Nintendo's Mario Kart.

Anki Drive, a game by a San Francisco company of the same name, is now on sale in the UK and US. The game blurs the line between video and toy games, enabling players to race round on a 'roll-able' track that uses smart technology to ensure the cars stay within lines on the surface

Called
 Anki Drive, players control physical cars on a ‘smart track’ with an 
iPhone or iPad and use virtual power-ups to beat opponents.

Up
 to four players can race cars around the tracks, or players can go it 
alone and battle against the artificial intelligence, built into the 
cars.

Anki Drive is available now for £179.99 ($199.95) and comes with two cars, while each additional car costs an extra £49.99 ($69.95).

Within each car is a small camera that let them ‘see’ where they are going.

This camera points straight down and looks through the track into the circuitry underneath.

The track itself provides information for the car as to where it can drive.

A 50 megahertz computer on each car monitors where it is on the track 500 times every second.

This then feeds information to the motors in the two rear wheels so the car knows where to drive.

Every two milliseconds they make an adjustment to the rear motors to stay on trajectory.

According to chief executive and co-founder Boris Stofman, ‘if you scaled it up to real-world size it would be equivalent to driving down a highway at 250 miles (400 kilometres) per hour with a concrete wall a tenth of an inch from your windows, and staying within that wall.'

The track itself, about the size of a tabletop, can be rolled out onto any surface, and the matchbox-sized cars are then placed on the track and controlled by players using their chosen device.

This is done via a free app for iOS that syncs devices with the cars - and the company told MailOnline there are also plans to eventually bring the technology to Android.

Each car automatically follows the racing lines of the track.

Using their chosen device, players can then speed up and slow down their car, turn from side-to-side, or use a variety of virtual power ups.

On the screen of the app are various input mechanisms to play the game, ranging from a 'throttle' for speed and power-ups to be used during a race.

There are two game modes - Battle, which sees players attempt to ‘destroy’ each other on the track, or a Standard race mode to a set number of laps.

Players are also given access to ‘weapons’ such as a virtual rail gun that they can fire at other cars while on the track.

Disabling another car will make it stop moving until it recovers, allowing others to drive past.

Up to four players can race around the track using one of several uniquely programmed cars (pictured). Each of the cars have different attributes; some are faster and more agile, while others have access to better virtual weapons that could be used to disable the cars of other players

A number of other power-ups, including a boost function and the ability to reverse a car around on track, lets players either avoid attacks or speed to victory.

And each car is also programmed uniquely, with some being more accustomed to battles and others better suited to speed.

As races and battles are completed, players additionally get access to upgrades that can be applied to their car.

And if a gamer upgrades their own car, they can take it to a friend's house and use it on their track with the upgrades intact.

Anki Drive bears many similarities to Scalextric tracks of old, but with a new twist that uses modern technologies to provide a new way to play.

The game was designed by graduates from Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute in Pittsburgh.

The track can be rolled out onto a flat surface on which the cars can then race. For now this is one of two tracks available, but the company say it is possible much larger tracks could be released in future. For example, they say a large track unfolded in the kitchen at their office was able to host 128 cars at one time

Scalextrix (stock image shown) is a slot-car toy racing game created by Minimodels and now owned by Hornby. It was released back in 1957 and sees players use a controller with a throttle to alter the speed of cars on track as they followed rails around and race each other

‘We found this technology fascinating and capable of doing amazing things,’ chief executive and co-founder Boris Sofman told MailOnline.

‘We wanted to apply it to commercial products.

‘So we started with a game where we wanted to bridge the worlds of toys and video games.’Sofman explains how the game, while simple at its heart, can be mastered by more experienced players to give entirely new experiences.

The mechanics are simple and easy to teach, he says, meaning anyone can pick up and play.

‘5 year-olds love it, 40 year-olds love it, 80 year-olds love it,’ he continued.

‘People love being able to have this level of competition in physical form that’s never existed outside the screen.

‘The family gaming aspect is something that’s very appealing.’

The company also hinted there may be opportunities to apply the same technology used in the cars to future games - such as miniature robots fighting it out in a 'smart arena'.
