Children's confused reactions to a Nintendo Game Boy have been caught on camera, with the majority expressing pity for 'people in the past' who played such clunky video games.

Los Angeles-based filmmakers Benny and Rafi Fine asked volunteers aged six to 13 to guess what the bulky device was, with suggestions including a 'telephone' or 'television'.

'My dad had this', 10-year-old Caden declared as he looked over the Eighties-era console, while 10-year-old Morgan exclaimed, 'I'm scared! I thought it was going to zap me.'

Compassionate: After examining the Game Boy, Evan, 7 (pictured) said he ' kind of feel bad for the people in the past'

Showing how inclusive gaming has become, 10-year-old Addy reacted strongly when she saw the Game Boy for the first time: 'Girls can play this. Why isn't it called Game Boy/Girl?'

After being told the portable device was used to play games, a YouTube video shows each child struggling to insert a game cartridge into the back of the Game Boy.

But the next problem they encounter is how to turn the device on.

'Start. I pressed start,' a confused-looking Sydney, six, said as she repeatedly pressed the start button (the on/off button is at the top of the console).

After conquering the on/off milestone, the baffled kids were asked to play the game - with mixed results.

'It's kind of boring,' Evan, seven, declared, followed by a compassionate, 'I kind of feel sad for the people in the past.'

An ambivalent Sydney, six, said, 'I actually like it but I also hate it,' while Dylan, 12, concluded, 'I think my mom would be better at this.'

Shocked: Caden, 10 (pictured) was surprised to hear more than 64 million Game Boys were sold - a few million less than PlayStation 3 and XBox 360

The Game Boy, an eight-bit handheld video game device released in 1989, was a tremendous success for Nintendo.

More than 64 million units of the battery-operated device were sold - a few million less than XBox 360 and PlayStation 3.

The YouTube video has been watched more than 6.9 million times since it was uploaded on July 6.

Many older viewers said it was 'sad' and 'disgusting' that the iPad generation had no idea what old technology looked like.

'I can't be this old and I still remember blowing cartridges to make a game work on a Nintendo, right? Right?'

The Fine Brothers have produced several 'Kids React' videos, showing the reactions of iPad generation children to contraptions from the 1990s and earlier.

Some of the more hilarious reactions were to the Sony Walkman and rotary telephone.
