His entrepreneurial spirit is undeniable.

Inspired by TV show Dragons’ Den, Tommie Rose targeted a gap in the market at his school – selling crisps and fizzy drinks, which are banned under a ‘healthy eating’ policy.

His smuggled snacks are so popular that he claims to have earned £14,000 in just three years, and even employs two other pupils. Tommie, 15, says he is saving the cash to pay for tuition fees if he fulfils his dream of winning a place to study business at Oxford or Cambridge.

Business prowess: Tommie Rose, 15, has managed to earn a staggering £14,000 by selling chocolate, sweets and fizzy drinks in the playground of his school in Salford, Greater Manchester 

However, he has fallen foul of teachers, who have threatened to suspend him for undermining school policies aimed at combating obesity. Yesterday their stance was slammed by entrepreneurs including Dragons’ Den star Deborah Meaden, who wrote online: ‘[Tommie] doesn’t need a degree in business ... He’s a natural.’

The teenager, who is in Year Ten at Buile Hill Visual Arts College in Salford, Greater Manchester, said yesterday: ‘I got the idea from watching Dragons’ Den and feeling I could do something like that.’

He operated a similar undercover tuck shop at his previous school, Oasis Academy, but was repeatedly suspended and eventually expelled. Buile Hill headmaster James Inman said: ‘We admire this pupil’s entrepreneurship but school is not the place to set up a black market.’

Tommie’s father Gary, a 33-year-old office worker, said: ‘From our point of view, he’s not selling cigarettes, alcohol or drugs ... he’s selling sweets, which teenagers are always going to consume no matter where they buy them from.’ However, a school source said Tommie was disruptive at school and well short of being Oxbridge material. ‘He was taken on from his previous school in good faith on the understanding that he wouldn’t set up another miniature tuck shop,’ they added.

 

Warning: James Inman, headmaster at Buile Hill Visual Arts College, above, has told Tommie that he will be suspended unless he shuts down his playground business

Aspirations: The entrepreneurial teenager has been saving thousands in a trust fund in the hope of paying for a business degree from Oxford or Cambridge

Previous school: Tommie left Oasis Academy, in Salford, above, in 2011 after they suspended him for ten days over his playground sweet business

While business owners are required to register their companies  - the HMRC suggested it was extremely unlikely Tommie would be pursued for failing to do so.

A spokesman said: 'There are penalties for failure to notify where someone has started a business and not let us know. 

'But we would never penalise a young entrepreneur for his industry and imagination in starting a business from scratch, off his own back.'
