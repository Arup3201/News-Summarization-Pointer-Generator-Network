Impact substitute. It sounds such an all-action role. Often it is. Impact is one of those words that just conjures excitement in the brain. And in the cinema.

There is Impact, a 1949 crime drama involving a cheating wife and a duplicitous husband. Impact, a 2008 television mini-series in which an asteroid sets the moon on collision course with earth. Deep Impact, 1998 film, same thing but with a seven-mile wide comet making a pest of itself. And Sudden Impact, the fourth Dirty Harry movie and the one in which Clint Eastwood actually says 'Go ahead – make my day.'

Will Roy Hodgson's impact substitute be making anybody's day in Brazil? That is the question.

On his bike: Raheem Sterling appeared in good spirits after England touched down in Rio on Sunday

Flying the flag: Sterling was forced to watch Saturday's game from the stands as he was suspended

By popular consent the brightest spark in England's pre-World Cup friendly matches has been Ross Barkley. Mention his name, however, and the phrase impact substitute rolls off an informed tongue by way of reply.

In training, Raheem Sterling is said to have excelled. Again the clever money is on his late introduction, when he can have the greatest effect on tired legs, certainly in tropical Manaus on Saturday against Italy. 

This always presumes there is a contest to have impact on by that time. If England were losing by a slender margin, Sterling or Barkley could snatch a handy point. If they were losing by two goals or more, to claw England's way back against any reasonably competent Italian side would be tough. And if England were drawing? That is where the impact argument falls down.

Italy 0 England 0, 20 minutes remaining. Is Hodgson seriously going to gamble on attack-minded substitutions, just at the point when his opponents are quite possibly settling for honours even?

Impressive: Ross Barkley has been the brightest spark in England's pre-World Cup friendly matches

The creatives play from the start or, more than likely, they remain spectators if the game is at stalemate long into the second half.  Nobody would blame Hodgson for caution in those circumstances. If he gambled and lost the whole dynamic of the World Cup campaign would change.

So the idea of impact substitutions is bunk, unless specific circumstances dictate.  The theory that England will play a game of containment for 75 minutes and, if that works, metamorphose into thrilling cavaliers for the final 15 minutes is so far-fetched it should be a film script.

In the Hollywood version, the hero of Impact Substitute comes on and scores four goals in the last ten minutes; in real life he looks glumly on as England and Italy play out time and shake hands.

Hodgson sought not to lose in the tight match away in Ukraine last year, too. The score was 0-0 going into the final 30 minutes in Kiev. On the bench were Barkley, Sterling and the form man of the moment, Andros Townsend.  Hodgson brought on Ashley Young for Jack Wilshere, who was having a poor game, and Tom Cleverley for Theo Walcott very late.

Early bath: Sterling was sent off during England's clash against Ecuador and was subsequently suspended

To the surprise of nobody he did not go for broke as the referee began checking his watch. He made one like-for-like replacement and another intended to shore up  midfield. That is what managers do. They play the percentages.

These warm-up matches have been a missed opportunity, sadly. One of two primary aims has been unfulfilled and that was Hodgson's fault.

He needed to find out about the best two youngsters in English football - Barkley and Sterling - and yet on one count remains very much in the dark.

Barkley impressed in a cameo against Peru, was even better when starting against Ecuador and made a very good impression coming on at half time against Honduras.

In charge: But has Roy Hodgson missed a trick by not starting with Sterling against Peru or Ecuador?

Sterling, who knows? Hodgson rejected the chance to start him against Peru or Ecuador and was faced with a young man so desperate to make an impression in that second game that he got sent-off and missed the final match in which he was ear-marked to start.

And there is the folly of the impact substitute. By delaying Sterling's involvement, Hodgson lost the chance to see him to any degree of usefulness.

In the 1991 FA Cup semi-final with Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur manager Terry Venables was told by the club doctor that Paul Gascoigne would not last much more than 30 minutes.  He had the choice of starting him, or bringing him on. Venables chose to start him. His logic was simple.

'What if we were 3-0 down after an hour? We would never know what difference he could have made.'

Tough draw: England were frustrated not to have beaten 10-man Honduras in their final warm-up match

He told Gascoigne to see what he could do in 30 minutes: and he won the game in ten. The myth of the impact substitute eschews another, more logical, tactic.

Get ahead and then  consolidate. Defend that lead.  Why can't the impact substitute be the diligent worker whose care sees out the game, once the most dangerous players have done the hardest part?

There is a reason the order of play for the singles matches on the final day of the Ryder Cup is so key to the captain's art. Front-load the team too heavily and there is a risk of rookies in the tail not being able to get over the line.  Put all of your best players down the order to finish the job and there is a chance they could be stranded out on the course, the competition over and their match an irrelevance. Tiger Woods was furious when this happened to him at The Belfry in 2002 when Curtis Strange kept all of his strongest golfers in reserve and Sam Torrance of Europe did the opposite.

We know that football is about 14 players, not 11, these days, but it seems almost perverse to concede that a player is a match-winner - and that is what an impact substitute equates to, after all - then keep him on the bench.

It may be that Hodgson is gearing up to spring a surprise with Sterling, as he did by selecting Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain for the first game of the 2012  European Championships against France.

It may be that he thinks a slower tempo is the only way a fixture in Manaus can be approached and young attacking players in a first World Cup may run themselves out.

Yet it is always harder to work without the ball. England invariably tire in the heat of tournament competition because they do too much hurrying and scurrying, while their opponents keep possession.

The greatest impact would involve addressing that historical flaw, a change that would be as startling as any seven-mile wide comet.
