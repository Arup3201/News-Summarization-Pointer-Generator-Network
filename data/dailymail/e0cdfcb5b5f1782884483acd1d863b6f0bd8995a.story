Justin Bieber has been hit with a bill for thousands of dollars by the German animal shelter where his confiscated pet monkey has been held for two months.

The 19-year-old singer has until midnight to reclaim Mally, a capuchin monkey, and will have to pay up for his care even if he does not take the animal back.

Mally will be transferred to a permanent home at a German zoo or animal park if Bieber does not take him back in time.

Stranger moments: Justin's monkey Mally was confiscated while on tour in Germany

'If no further documents arrive then the seizure order comes into effect and the animal becomes the property of the German state,' said Munich customs office spokesman Thomas Meister.

Mally was seized by German customs March 28 when Bieber failed to produce required vaccination and import papers after landing in Munich while on tour.

The monkey was given to the singer for his 19th 
birthday last month from music producer Jamal 'Mally Mal' Rashid and had
been taken away from his mother when he was only nine weeks old.

The now 20-week-old animal was quarantined and cared for at Munich's animal shelter, where manager Karl Heinz Joachim said Mally had fared well and gained weight.

The shelter has criticized Bieber for keeping such a young monkey as a pet, saying it shouldn't have been taken away from its mother until it was a year old.

Experts say capuchin monkeys also need to be kept in groups as they are very sociable animals.

Bieber must pay for Mally's care whether he takes the monkey back or not

'The best thing would be not to buy one at all, but if you do, buy five,' said Mr Joachim.

He said emails from Bieber's management to the animal shelter indicated the singer does not want the monkey anymore, but that the final decision would have to be made by German authorities.

'Our contact is the person that the monkey belongs to,' said Mr Meister.

'We've had contact with lots of people but none of them was an authorised representative.'

He said the cost of care, food and vet visits at the Munich shelter amounted to several thousand (dollars).

'You can bet we are going to ask for that money back,' he said.

Mally the monkey is now in quarantine at a German animal shelter

The capuchin monkey, taken from its mother at nine weeks, is treating a cuddly toy as its surrogate parent 

Normally capuchin monkeys remain with their mothers for at least the first year of their life.

He is now in quarantine in a Munich animal sanctuary where his only companion is a cuddly toy that he treats as a surrogate mother.

Mally also spends his time repeatedly calling out in the hope of finding other members of his family group - something which Mr Joachim, 64, described last month as 'heartbreaking'.

He said at the time: 'Justin Bieber has won an extension because the four week limit on confiscated animals only applies if the owner does not get in touch. 

'However his management team had been in touch and indicated that they want the monkey back which means they now have as much time as they need to get the paperwork ready.

'If that takes months then it's months that they have. But that just isn't acceptable for the baby monkey needs company and to be with other monkeys at this crucial age in its life.

'We'll appeal to the star to do the decent thing and let the monkey be free for adoption. 

'There are a great many suitable 
places that have offered to take Mally and integrate him with their own 
capuchin monkeys where he would be much more happy with his own kind.

'A baby monkey is not something suitable to be on a world tour even if he is travelling by private jet.

'He
should be out in the wild climbing trees and learning from other 
monkeys if he isn't to have serious psychological problems later in 
life.'

The boss of the Munich animal shelter asked Bieber to do 'the decent thing' and let the animal be adopted

Mally spends his time repeatedly calling in the hope of finding other members of his family group, animal shelter staff said

A German customs spokesman said at the time of the confiscation that Bieber lacked documents certifying compliance with animal health and species-protection regulations.

Mr Joachim said if it took months to sort out the paperwork and all that time was spent in a cage it would do irreparable damage to the monkey's mental state.

He said if Bieber were to refuse to allow the monkey to be adopted by a suitable organisation then the only hope lay with the Bavarian environment ministry.

However the Ministry has so far declined to comment on the case.
