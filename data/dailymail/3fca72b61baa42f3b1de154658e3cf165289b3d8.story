Crushed by his own booby trap: Extreme hoarder Langley Collyer

It might seem like a relatively new - and bizarre - phenomenon; extreme hoarders who fill their houses so full of clutter that their bodies lay undiscovered for, sometimes, weeks after their death.

However, two brothers in 1940s New York arguably set the gold standard in stockpiling junk when they died entombed in their own clutter.

Homer and Langley Collyer were killed by one of the many booby traps they had set to deter outsiders, but their bodies were hidden by tons of garbage and were not found for weeks.

The brothers' story began in the 
beginning of the 20th century but ended in 1947 when they died 
side-by-side buried under piles of rubbish that had accumulated in their
Manhattan row house.

Homer, the older of the two, was blind and was cared for by younger brother Langley at the house in Harlem.

Langley believed his brother's sight could be restored with a diet high in vitamin C so he fed Homer 100 oranges a week.

In
the meantime, Langley began keeping years' worth of newspapers so his 
brother could read them once his sight had been restored.

What
started as a well-meaning but misguided gesture escalated over the 
years into an out-of-control collection that engulfed their home and the
brothers became recluses, prisoners in their own house.

The
extent of the brother's junk collecting finally came to a head in March
1947 when the authorities received a tip-off that someone had died in 
the property.

At first, it was near-impossible to gain
entry to the house. Tons of debris - including old newspapers, 
phonebooks and furniture boxes - were slowly removed from the front 
foyer but rescuers found themselves blocked out by walls of rubbish.

It wasn't until a patrol officer broke a window on the second floor and climbed through that the first body was discovered, the Unclutterer website reported.

After two hours spent climbing 
through junk and debris the body of Homer was found lying among boxes 
and trash. However, his younger brother was nowhere to be seen.

A
massive hunt was launched, with the authorities searching places as far
away as Atlantic City in a bid to find the missing brother.

However, three weeks later it dawned on them he had been under their noses all along, according to Unclutterer.

The body of Langley was found just ten feet away from where his older brother had died, but he was buried under tons of debris.

The authorities discovered that Langley had actually been the first to die, killed by one of the many booby-traps he had set up to deter outsiders from coming inside house of junk.

He had been bringing food to his older brother when it collapsed on top of him, crushing him to death.

More than 100 tons of rubbish - including more than 25,000 books - was eventually removed from the house, with the authorities discovering an astonishing array of bizarre items collected by the Collyer brothers.

Among them were pickled human organs, hundreds of yards of unused silk and fabric, the folding top of a horse-drawn carriage and the chassis of an old Model T.
