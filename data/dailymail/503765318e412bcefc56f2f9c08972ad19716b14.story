This is the heartbreaking moment a hippopotamus stood motionless and howled in grief after discovering the body of her dead baby before angrily defending the corpse from others.

Wildlife photographer Neal Cooper captured the scene in Kasane, Botswana, as the mother stood helpless above the body of the young calf.

Mr Cooper said he initially thought the hippo was stood above a large rock, but came to realise the grim reality as the animal's bawling roared around the park.

Anguish: A hippopotamus stands motionless over the body of her dead calf and howls in grief

Heartbroken: The grief-stricken mother angrily defended the calf's body from other hippos after discovering it lying motionless on the floor

The mother's anguish soon turned to rage however as she was pictured warning off other animals by baring her teeth.

Mr Cooper said: 'It was to be a trip not to be forgotten quickly.

'We spotted a hippopotamus standing motionless on the river bank with her head resting on something which looked like a rock and as we approached we spotted something lying on the ground in front of her.

'It turned out to be a very young dead hippo. I couldn't see any wounds on the side which was showing, so we pulled up the boat, kept a safe distance and watched as another very large hippo approached from the water.

'The mother hippo was showing all possible signs of aggression towards the intruder by spraying her faeces, showing her teeth and saliva dripping from her mouth.

'The other hippo, although a very large individual, dared not exit the river and face the mother so stayed in the water and eventually moved a safer distance away.

Angry: Mr Cooper said the mother was continuing to display aggressive behaviour towards the other hippos the following day and charged towards an individual before two other hippos attacked her

'It really was quite a distressing sight to see unfold in-front of you.'

Hippos are regarded as among the most lethal animals in Africa and mothers are well-known for being highly territorial when looking after their young.

Mr Cooper said: 'We believe the youngster was either killed when it got in the way of a fight between adults or maybe even by a male hippo who killed the youngster to rule out future competition.

'We stayed with the grieving and obviously distressed mother as long as we could before we had to be out of the park and we left her standing over her dead calf.

'The next morning we decided to go back to the area to see if the carcass had attracted any predators during the night, but when we arrived we saw two other hippos standing over the body.

Aggression: Mr Cooper said the mother was chased around by the other hippos 'until she found a spot in deeper water and it eventually calmed down'

'A very large female was mouthing the carcass and when it was turned over we could see a bite mark on the side of the baby with the entrails showing.

'The mother emerged from the reeds from across the water and immediately lifted her head and stared at the intruders.

'The two hippos had by now entered the water and moved towards the rest of the pod while the mother had also entered the water and took up position a short distance away from the grouped animals.

'She was still displaying aggressive behaviour towards the other hippos when she charged towards an individual before two other hippos attacked her from behind.

'They chased her around until she found a spot in deeper water and it eventually calmed down but the whole thing was absolutely incredible to see.'
