An Atlanta mother-of-two who was convicted of lying to police after her lover and then-boss gunned down her husband at their children's preschool, has been released from prison today.

Andrea Sneiderman was released after serving less than a year of her five-year sentence for perjury and obstructing a police investigation into the 2010 murder of husband Russell 'Rusty' Sneiderman, 36. She received a year's credit for time service - some of it while on house arrest.

Her former boss and lover, Henny Neuman, was convicted in March 2012 of the killing, though he was found mentally ill after he testified that an angel who looked like Olivia Newton John and a ghost who sounded like Barry White told him to shoot Mr Sneiderman. 

It is unknown whether Sneiderman will get back custody of her children now that she is released. Her husband's parents had been fighting her family to retain custody of them boy and girl, age 5 and 8.

Neiderman was arrested in August 2012 after she testified under oath that she did not have an affair with her former boss Henny Neuman

Mrs Sneiderman was initially arrested in August 2012 and charged with orchestrating the murder - though later those charges were dropped and prosecutors instead alleged that she lied to cover up her affair with Neuman.

Mr Sneiderman's family testified that Mrs Sneiderman knew her husband had been shot - even before she was told by authorities.

Her refusal to disclose the affair with Neuman meant that it took detectives nearly two months to learn the motive for the killing at the upscale preschool - which rocked Atlanta's tight-knit Jewish population. 

Prosecutors said she repeatedly lied to investigators and also lied on the witness stand at Neuman's trial - denying the the two were having an affair and refusing to tell the truth about when she learned her husband had been shot.

In August 2013, a jury convicted Sneiderman of nine of 13 counts.

She after the conviction, she pleaded with the judge for leniency - arguing that her two small children needed their mother after their father was murdered.

A judge sentenced her to five years in prison, but gave her credit for one year served on house arrest and in jail awaiting trial.

A parole board further reduced the sentence to 22 months, with a year's credit for time served.

Authorities say she walked out of Lee Arrendale State Prison at 12.22am on Monday.
