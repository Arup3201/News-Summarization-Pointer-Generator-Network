If you have ever dreamt of smothering your home-cooked meals in McDonald's Big Mac sauce - now is your chance as Australians have the exclusive offer of purchasing their own famous burger condiment.

Until now, the Big Mac sauce has only been delivered to McDonald’s outlets in sealed canisters and directly dispensed onto the burger using a specially calibrated ‘sauce gun’.

But Macca's fans will need to get in quick because each of the 920 Australian stores only have 600 25ml tubs on offer to take home.

Only one 500ml bottle of the Big Mac Special Sauce is being auctioned off on eBay with money going to charity

Although the magic ingredients for the sauce have never been a secret - it's the ratio to create distinct flavour that remains a mystery.

The sauce is made up of a blend of relish, mustard, onion and garlic, along with other ingredients, which gives it that distinctive sweet and sour taste. 

'Big Mac sauce is one of the most iconic McDonald's ingredients and people often ask us where they can buy it; so we're excited to be the first country in the world to offer tubs of Big Mac sauce to our customers,' McDonald's Australia, Chief Marketing Officer Mark Lollback said.

'I know of people who love adding our special sauce to all types of food – from french fries to McNuggets – so it's going to be interesting to see what Aussies choose to add a spot of Big Mac sauce to over the next month.'

The ingredients that make up the Big Mac are the same today as when the burger was first created 40 years ago – two all beef patties, Special Sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun

Each 920 of the McDonald's stores throughout Australia have 600 25ml tubs available until sold out

The first chance Aussies will have to get their hands on some Big Mac sauce is through an eBay auction of an exclusive 500ml bottle that kicked off last night, with proceeds going to Ronald McDonald House Charities. 

The bottle is one of only 200 produced in the world with the remaining 199 not available for purchase. 

'We're excited to be auctioning off the first-ever bottle of Big Mac sauce for a cause we are passionate about,' Mr Lollback said. 

'It's going to be interesting to see just how much people are prepared to pay for such a sought after commodity.'

A vending machine tour is travelling to Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane throughout February to give Aussies the chance to grab a free tub in return for a tweet.
