The box contains eight chocolates, each with a different design and flavour.

One of the chocolates features an illustration of Miss Winehouse's face.

Singer Miss Winehouse died on July 27 2011, at the age of 27.

Mr Persoone delivers chocolates to restaurants in Belgium and beyond.

The chocolatier has previously worked with artists such as the Rolling Stones.

East London-based Mr Hate knew the singer for a number of years before her death.

The £140-an-hour artist first met the artist when she came into his shop, spending three hours getting a tattoo done.

Mr Hate was filmed speaking about their relationship on Belgian television station Deredactie this week.
