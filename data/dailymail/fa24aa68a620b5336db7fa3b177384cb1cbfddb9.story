Charged: Matthew Sowders faces two capital murder charges for the death of his estranged wife Melissa and her unborn child

The estranged husband of a pregnant young mother whose strangled body was found in a Houston river has now been arrested and charged with her murder.

Matthew Sowders claims that his now-dead wife, Melissa, pulled a gun on him and his lawyers are entering a not guilty plea.

Prosecutors paint an entirely different picture, saying that Matthew told two different friends that he strangled his wife on Boxing Day after an altercation that occurred when she met him to drop off one of their children with him at an area McDonalds.

'The defendant came to her residence on December 26, she stated he was soaking wet and his truck was covered in mud. He told her she strangled her to death after he pulled a gun on her,' one of the prosecutors said in court, according to The Inquisitr.

'He said he stuffed her into a large black trash can and transported to Cypress Creek and there he submerged her body.'

The 28-year-old now faces capital murder charges for both Melissa, 26, and her unborn child.

Other reports assert that Matthew snapped when he found out that the unborn child was not his and rather was a result of her relationship with her current boyfriend Jason Sanford.

Melissa, who has four children with Matthew, was two months pregnant with she and Jason's child at the time that she disappeared on December 26.

Fears: Melissa Sowders, 26, has been missing since last Thursday. The pregnant mother-of-four was going to meet her estranged husband when she vanished and her abandoned car was found the next day

Her body was found in Cypress Creek in Harris County a week after she disappeared.

The
 investigation included surveillance footage that showed her rubbing her 
stomach as she headed to meet Matthew's godparents the day before she 
disappeared.

She was not showing at the time, but her attention to her stomach made it clear to viewers that she was aware of her pregnancy.

Concerns: Her family says she was terrified of her ex - but police have not named him a suspect

Matthew
 Sowders originally claimed that he had nothing to do with his estranged
 wife's disappearance, but went on to hire a lawyer and stop cooperating
 with police.

The 
Inquisitr reports that he filed for divorce from Melissa, the mother of 
his four children who are all under the age of 8, in October but still 
had questions about the unborn child's paternity.

'As far as we know he has threatened 
her numerous times. He has had a knife to her throat before,' Melissa's 
cousin Michelle Bierman told ABC News.

'We think he just went off the edge when he found out she was two months pregnant with Jason's child.'

Miss Sowder's family say they fear she is already dead, that she drowned in Cypress Creek.

'The water is cold, she's in there. It's not a proper place,' Michelle Bierman, Miss Sowder's cousin, told KHOU.

Mr Sanford, told police he last saw her when she took him to work at 6.15am on Thursday in her white Honda Accord.

He
 told deputies that she was supposed to meet her ex-husband and their 
youngest daughter at a McDonald's - and her family said they fear he 
could be involved in her disappearance.

Search: Deputies with the Harris County Sheriff Department had searched a wooded area along Cypress Creek on Saturday. They were then searching the water for any signs of the woman's body

'She was terrified of him. Terrified,' Michelle Bierman, Sowders' cousin, told KHOU11 on Monday.

Relatives
 told the news channel that her estranged husband was abusive towards 
her and did not like her having a new boyfriend or having a child by 
him.

'Pretty much from the first day that we knew she was missing, and the circumstances of how she went missing. We knew. We knew,' Bierman added.

Court records show that the ex-husband, who has custody of their children, actually filed for divorce in October.

Authorities have interviewed the man but have not named him as a suspect.

Volunteers from Texas Equusearch are using boats with sonar equipment at Cypress Creek and said they have already found readings of interest in 12 feet of water.
