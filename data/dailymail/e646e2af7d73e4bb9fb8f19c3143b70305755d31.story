A mysterious creature with sharp claws and pointy teeth was discovered on a beach in Santa Barbara on Tuesday after the most recent storm hitting the area.

The apparent monster is brownish in color and was discovered near a drain washout, reports KEYT.com.

The unidentified beast has left residents baffled and no one has been able to identify the species of animal found on the shore nor do they know where it came from.

Mysterious creature: The hairless carcass, with sharp teeth and claws, was found dead on the beach in Santa Barbara after the latest storm, and many people are wondering what it is

Santa Barbara saw brutal storms over the past few days that left behind damage in the area. 

A similar looking creature was found in San Diego back in June of 2012.

The picture was taken by Josh Menard, a 19-year-old snowboarder from Lake Tahoe.

According to Josh, the animal is about 2ft long and 'had the body shape of a pig - kind of a fat stomach, middle area. And the canines were just ridiculously large.'
