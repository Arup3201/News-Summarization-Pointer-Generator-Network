Nearly 150 passengers were forced to evacuate a India's IndiGo plane via escape chutes on Wednesday after heavy smoke was reported coming from the aircraft.

The IndiGo Airbus A320 arriving from Mumbai was carrying 147 passengers and six crew members who were ordered to disembark when air traffic controllers informed the captain of the incident.

While a problem with the landing gear has been reported as the source of the smoke, this has not been confirmed by the airline, which denied there was an emergency.

Some of the passengers on board Flight 6E-176 at Delhi Airport sustained minor injuries after taking the quick route off the plane down emergency slides on the taxi way but no-one was seriously hurt..

A statement from the airline said the flight made a 'normal landing' and on runway 27 at 3.35pm.

'As soon as the Captain got the information about the dense smoke from the ATC tower, he immediately ordered the crew to evacuate all passengers in the interest of passengers and crew safety,' the statement continued.

'The evacuation was done on taxi way after safely landing the aircraft.
