A neighbour from hell with 80 criminal convictions has been evicted from her house after leaving it in such a squalid state it will be months before it is habitable again.

The walls may still be standing but inside the two-bedroom property police officers found holes in the walls and ceiling, carpets pulled up and wallpaper ripped off.

Dawn Pugh Jones had lived in the property since 2004 but was finally forced to leave after making the lives of nearby residents a 'misery', according to council chiefs.

No fit state: With wallpaper torn off and holes in the furniture, it will be months before the home is habitable

She has blighted neighbours for over a decade with criminal offences dating back to the 90s.

According
 to Tai Ceredigion housing association in Wales, the two-bedroom 
semi-detached house often staged parties and was the subject of constant reports of loud music, 
shouting and swearing.

When a team of PCSOs and police officers eventually entered the house they found holes in floorboards and walls, which housing officers said were used for hiding drugs and paraphernalia. 

Among Pugh Jones' 80 convictions are drugs offences, violent crimes and repeated breaching of community and noise abatement orders.

The constant disruption caused by unemployed tenant was so bad that police had even set up a CCTV camera focusing on the door of the house.

Ceredigion county council obtained a Possession Order and 
Anti-Social Behaviour Injunction at Aberystwyth County Court in October this year. 

Last week, bailiffs and officers from Dyfed Powys Police served an eviction order against Pugh Jones, removing her from the house so that the clean-up operation inside could begin.

In the two-bedroom property, there was
 a stench of stale tobacco, the kitchen units were in a poor state, 
carpets and tiles had been pulled up, and wallpaper ripped off.

Squalid: The house has been given as a bail address by several court defendants, according to police

Troubled tenant: Pugh Jones has more than 80 convictions and was kicked out after being given an ASBO

She left holes in walls and a ceiling, and greasy and rusty utensils scattered across the kitchen.

It is estimated that it will take £5,000 and months of cleaning to make the house habitable again.

Dawn
 Pugh Jones was evicted from the property, which she had lived since 
2004, for staging constant loud parties that council chiefs said made 
the lives of nearby residents a 'misery'.

According
 to Tai Ceredigion housing association in Wales, the two-bedroom 
semi-detached house was the subject of constant reports of loud music, 
shouting, swearing.

Pugh Jones has convictions for violence and drugs offences and according to police, several court defendants have also given the house at 14 Maesheli as their bail address when being released from police custody.

The 41-year-old walked out of the property quietly this week but a lorry carrying her possessions moved her only a mile down the road to a new house that is a six-minute drive away.

One neighbour, who did not wish to be identified, said 'she had made life very tough here', while another another added: 'I’m glad she’s gone.'

'One of the worst': The house will now have to be boarded up while recovery teams work inside. The damage was some of most extensive Tai Ceredigion Housing Associaton had seen, according to a spokesperson

Tai Ceredigion Housing Association 
said work to make the property habitable again may take several months 
and could cost in the region of £5,000.

A spokesperson for the association said: 'This really is one of the worst houses we've come across.

'When we eventually got access to it, the place was filthy, the kitchen looked as though it had never been cleaned and there were holes in the structure of the house.

'We believe the holes had been used for hiding drugs.'

Steve Jones, the housing association’s chief executive, said: 'We are extremely grateful to everyone concerned in helping us to gather evidence to remove this person from the estate, where her behaviour was making life a misery for other tenants and owner-occupiers.'

Arfon Jones, Ceredigion’s anti-social behaviour co-ordinator, added: 'Anti social behavior procedures are established through the Ceredigion Community Safety Partnership.

Police problem: Officers from Dyfed Powys constabulary became involved in the eviction

Enforcers: (L-R) PCSO James Crabb, David Weir from Tai Ceredigion Housing Association, PCSO Harriet Bergmanski, Arfon Jones from Ceredigion ASB unit and PC Helen Yelland from Dyfed Powys Police led the operation

This is an example of us working together to intervene in, and stop, such behaviour in our communities.'

Pc Helen Yelland, of Aberystwyth’s Neighbourhood Policing Team, added: 'No-one should suffer anti-social behaviour in silence.

'The action we have taken demonstrates that, with partners, we will address ASB to improve the quality of life of neighbours and the wider community.'
