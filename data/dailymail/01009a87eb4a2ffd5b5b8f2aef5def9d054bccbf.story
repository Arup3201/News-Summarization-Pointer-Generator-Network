It is difficult to see these masks catching on in high street fashion stores. In fact, it must be difficult to see anything if you are wearing one.

Maison Martin Margiela showed off these ‘masquerade veils’ made of tiled and beaded embroidery in Paris – to the general bemusement of fashion writers.

The French fashion house was forced to allay fears that the haute couture masks might put the wearers at risk of an accident.

Each mask took 18 hours to make including 'time for research, design, embroidery, fitting and assembly'

The 21st century design brought tongue-in-cheek writes-ups from the stunned fashion writers, who gave the new look the proverbial upside-down smiley face

‘The base of the masks is made of black silk gauze, a transparent material that allows models to see through it,’ a Margiela spokesman said.

‘It’s essential that this transparent material be in black and not white, because white becomes opaque.’

Head-encasing masks are a signature trope of Margiela and musician Kanye West sported the label's crystal version last season

The 21st century design brought tongue-in-cheek writes-ups from the stunned fashion writers, who gave the new look the proverbial upside-down smiley face.  

‘The refugees on the runway at the Martin Margiela couture show will have no trouble confusing the border police, as their faces are completely covered by masks, it is difficult to even imagine how they can find their way out from backstage,’ wrote Lynn Yaeger in leading US women’s magazine, The Cut, in a thinly veiled reference to the burqa ban enforced in France two years ago.

Head-encasing masks are a signature trope of Margiela and musician Kanye West sported the label’s crystal version last season.

Each mask from the autumn 2013 collection was made in-house at Margiela’s Paris atelier and took 18 hours to make, according to fashioista.com

‘That includes time for research, design, embroidery, fitting, and assembly,’ said the Margiela spokesperson.

‘The embroidery is always planned in a way that allows one to see past it.’
