Senator Nova Peris has denied using taxpayer money to facilitate a ten day extra-marital sexual liaison with Trinidad and Tobago sprinter Ato Boldon in 2010. 

The NT News allegedly obtained emails from 2010 showing that Ms Peris sourced funding from Athletics Australia to fly Mr Boldon to Australia for a ten-day trip for the 'Jump Start to London' program for young athletes.

The NT News claims the emails also detail an affair between the couple, with Ms Peris referring to their relations as being 'just like a tim-tam… black on black' and boasting that 'white men can't control black women'. 

At the time, Ms Peris was married to former Australian Olympic athlete, Daniel Batman.

Mr Batman, who had two children with Ms Peris before they split in 2010, died in a car crash in Darwin in 2012. 

Ms Peris said she would not comment on private matters.

'I categorically reject any wrongdoing,' she said in a statement.

'Nova Peris is a former training partner of mine, and has been a friend for almost 20 years. 

'My trip to Australia almost five years ago was for the purpose of holding several youth clinics, and it was a successful undertaking. 

'The trip was co-organized by one of my now-deceased colleagues at Athletics Australia. 

'The article recently written by the Northern Territory News, includes gross fabrications. 

'I will be following the senator’s lead, including, but not limited to, pursuing all legal action possible for this malicious misrepresentation of the details surrounding my presence in Australia in 2010.'  

'Documents provided to the NT News are private. It appears they were not lawfully obtained by a third party.'

Ms Peris told the NT News: 'The highs and lows of my private life are matters for me and my family.'

Mr Boldon said the article included 'gross fabrications'.

'Nova Peris is a former training partner of mine, and has been a friend for almost 20 years,' he said in a statement.

'My trip to Australia almost five years ago was for the purpose of holding several youth clinics, and it was a successful undertaking.'

Athletics Australia confirmed that Mr Boldon was the athlete selected by Ms Peris to conduct the program. 

Ms Peris was working as an ambassador for the organisation and as communications officer with the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies. 

NT News claim leaked documents reveal Peris allegedly organised the trip and sent sexually explicit emails.

'...You should be compensated for you long haul travels across the pacfic.. sexually of course,' Ms Peris allegedly wrote in an email, according to the NT News.

It is claimed Ms Peris abused her position as an ambassador for Athletics Australia to channel taxpayer funds to facilitate a ten-day sexual affair with Ato Boldon

In another email it is claimed she wrote: 'Ok now I have to give a talk to 200 kids and all I am going to be thinking about is f****** you now lol.'

It is reported that when Mr Boldon requested naked photos, Ms Peris replied: 

'Really, u want me to send some!!!! That is some freaky stuff Mr B…u like freaky??'

It's also claimed that Ms Peris organised for Mr Boldon to receive his payment tax-free, organising a waiver form so he would get all expenses paid, according to NT News. 

 '...It was not in the budget to bring any profile athletes out but…I am goin through the indigenous grants mob….they can do was I have suggested…but I am not sure what they can do …' 

In an email, Ms Peris allegedly tells Mr Boldon she has managed to organise $22,000 worth of extra work, in addition to the fee Athletics Australia paid. 

She also labelled former Olympic sprinter Cathy Freeman dumb and criticised her public speaking ability.

Athletics Australia confirmed that Mr Boldon's flight to Melbourne from Los Angeles was paid for by the organisation, in addition to his accommodation and other costs during his trip.

Ms Peris says that it appears the emails detailing her conversations with Mr Boldon 'were not lawfully obtained by a third party'

'Mr Boldon capably fulfilled his role as mentor and ambassador, and from our perspective upheld the bargain we had for him to come out and be an ambassador for the 'Jump Start to London' program for young athletes,' a spokesperson for Athletics Australia told Daily Mail Australia.

'We also have a relationship with Senator Peris who is a reputable former athlete and someone who we want to maintain a relationship with.'

Opposition leader Bill Shorten said Ms Peris  had his 'full support' and the support of the Labor caucus.

'I take her at her word, she's rejected any wrongdoing,' Mr Shorten said on Wednesday morning. 

'Let me just say about Nova Peris, she is a great Australian, she's done remarkable things in her athletics career, but I think even more significantly for the Northern Territory and for Indigenous Australians.'

'These are matters which are deeply personal to Senator Peris and pre-date her time in parliament.'

Labor frontbencher Tony Burke said he had the highest regard for Senator Peris.

'Nova Peris is an extraordinary person,' he told reporters in Canberra. 'We are a better parliament because Nova Peris is in it.'

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says the claims are a matter for Senator Peris.
