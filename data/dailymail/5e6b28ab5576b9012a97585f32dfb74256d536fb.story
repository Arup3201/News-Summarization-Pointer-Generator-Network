A woman who paid legal fees for convicted killer Joran van der 
Sloot, calling herself his 'guardian 
angel', has resigned from the case.

Mary Hamer, from Lake City, Florida, wrote a bizarre resignation letter saying she accepted defeat in the case, which found him guilty of murder.

Van der Sloot admitted to strangling Stephany Flores in May 2010 after she found out about his suspected involvement in the disappearance of U.S. teenager Natalee Holloway in 2005.

'I will fight no more': Dr Mary Hamer, 55, paid legal fees for convicted killer Joran van der Sloot - but has written a letter saying she has 'resigned' from his case

The 24-year-old killer was sentenced to 28 years behind bars earlier this month.

Throughout the Peruvian case, divorced radiologist Hamer had protested his innocence and shelled out around $100,000 to cover his legal fees.

The letter, obtained by Radar Online, is addressed to President Obama, Peruvian president Ollanta Humala, the Flores family and Natalee Holloway's mother Beth.

It says Hamer 'accepts defeat' in the case, adding: 'The U.S. government & Peru have won the battle.'

Killer: Joran Van der Sloot was found guilty of murdering Stephany Flores in 2010 after she found out about his suspected involvement in another disappearance

Victims: Flores, right, was strangled by van der Sloot after she found out about his suspected involvement in the disappearance of U.S. teen Natalee Holloway, left

'I, Mary Hamer officially and formally am resigning from my spiritual 
and civil rights advocacy work on behalf of Joran van der Sloot,' she writes.

She
also voices her fears the killer will die of a drug overdose or be 
murdered in jail, and that she will 'hold the Peruvian and US 
governments responsible if Mr. van der Sloot dies during his 28 year 
sentence'.

Dear President Obama, President Humala, Beth Holloway, the Flores family, the Media & Joran Van der Sloot:

I, Mary Hamer officially and formally am resigning from my spiritual 
and civil rights advocacy work on behalf of Joran van der Sloot.

The U.S. government & Peru have won the battle. I lose. I accept defeat.

I have fought fervently on behalf of Joran Van der Sloot with NO results. I have sacrificed my lifeâ€™s savings & I am now poor. I have risked death threats.

Joran did Not commit murder. Joran committed Manslaughter with Stephany Flores' provocation.

Joran had PTSD Diminished Mental Capacity & He was in a state of Self-Defense from years of a destroyed Self-esteem.

I will fight No more forever.

Thank you. Respectfully & Humbly, Mary Hamer, M.D. U.S.A.

She adds: 'I have sacrificed my life's savings and I am now poor. I have risked death threats.'

The
letter re-iterates her belief that van der Sloot did not kill Flores, 
rather he committed 'manslaughter with [her] provocation' after 
suffering from 'years of destroyed self esteem'.

It has previously emerged the killer had written to Hamer asking for more funds and claiming he 
loved her.

Hamer told Anderson Cooper in an 
interview earlier this month she trusts van der Sloot and believes he is
innocent - and denied he is playing her.

She said: 'I still don't know who killed Stephany Flores. There are too many unanswered questions.'

She claimed that the only reason he confessed to killing Ms Flores was because he was scared for his family's safety.

Van der Sloot was transferred to the 
high security Piedras Gordas facility in Lima 
after criticism conditions where he was being held were too 
comfortable. He reportedly enjoyed access to girlfriends while there.

Since then, he is said to have deteriorated after he was placed in solitary confinement.

An insider told RadarOnline.com: 'His health has suffered and he is not doing well there. Joran blames the food and the water, he says that he is depressed and feeling weak all the time.'

'I will fight no more': In the letter, Dr Mary Hamer says she has spent her life savings on legal fees for the case and received death threats

'Guardian angel': Van der Sloot had previously written to Hamer, who paid $100,000 towards his legal fees, asking for more funds and saying he loved her

Dr Hamer told RadarOnline.com: 'I am very worried about his deteriorating health. I am terrified and I feel powerless to help.'

The Dutch citizen met Stephany Flores, 21, in a casino in Lima in May 2010.

He took cash and credit cards from her before fleeing to Chile, where he was caught two days after her decaying body was found.

He confessed to the 'cruel' murder, telling police he became enraged after she found out about his suspected involvement in the Holloway case.

Ms Holloway, 18, from Mountain Brook, Birmingham, disappeared on Aruba in May 2005 during a high school graduation trip.

Van der Sloot was arrested over her disappearance, but never charged.
