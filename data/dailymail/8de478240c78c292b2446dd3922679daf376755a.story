A paralyzed shop worker who tried to shelter a mother and baby from a tornado has revealed how he is trying to rebuild his life two months after the failed rescue effort.

Despite his brave attempts to shield Megan Futrell, 29, and her four-month-old son, Case, they both died, and 7-Eleven worker EH Pittman remains paralyzed after the tornado ripped through the town of Moore, Oklahoma on May 20.

Mr Pittman, 29, had just returned home from a 13-month tour in Afghanistan with Oklahoma National Guard's 45th Infantry Brigade Combat Team when he went to work for the convenience store.

Mr Pittman's spinal cord was fractured, his
collarbones were broken and his lung collapsed as the tornado shattered the store into rubble.

A hole was torn into his lower back and he had two gashes on his head requiring 12 staples.

Mr Pittman, from Norman, said that he is now trying to learn how to cope with daily life once again, as he recovers in Integris Jim Thorpe Rehabilitation.

He told NewsOK that he remembers hiding in the bathroom with three colleagues, Ms Futrell and her baby, Edith 
Morales, 52, who also is paralysed and remains in the hospital, and 
another man.

Ms Futrell and her baby died, and Terri Long, 49, was the third person to die at the 7-Eleven after she sought shelter there.

His three co-workers lived with injuries and are recovering at their homes.

Mr Pittman said he recalls crouching on the floor of the bathroom, which they chose because they thought it would be safer and more stable.

He said rescue teams has asked him how many were in the store before they loaded him into an ambulance.

He said: ' I kept telling them about Megan and the baby. They hadn't found either one of them.'

The Oklahoma Medical Examiner increased the toll from the May 20 tornado at Moore after the death of a 90-year-old woman critically injured in the storm.

Spokesman Amy Elliott said Monday that the death of Kathryn Begay pushed the death toll to 25.

The town of Moore was destroyed and she suffered a fractured skull.

Officials say she suffered a pair of strokes after the storm and died last Thursday.
