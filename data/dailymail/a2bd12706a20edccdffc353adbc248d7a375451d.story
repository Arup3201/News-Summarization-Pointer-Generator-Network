New York Fashion Week saw the emergence of wearable technology on runways such as Opening Ceremony who debuted their smart MICA bracelet.

However for PPQ creating a futuristic vibe on the runway involves a little less technology and a little more tinsel.

For their SS15 collection showcased last night Le Peep Boutique on London's Park Lane, the British design duo, Amy Molyneaux and Percy Parker created a 'space safari' with a collection that the designer's are calling 'luna chic.'

PPQ's SS15 collection saw a collaboration with Claire's Accessories bringing high end to the high street including mother of pearl pieces like the necklace pictured

An array of silver 'tinsel' dresses, white suits and metallic sequins gave a nod to the 90s party scene that wouldn't look out of place in The Ministry of Sound. 

The palette conveyed the brand's notion of space age perfectly made-up entirely of silver and white in what the pair hope will be an uplifting collection that looks forward rather than back.

This collection sees the brand's high-end design meet high-street affordability as PPQ collaborates with accessories brand Claire's Accessories for their SS15 jewellery range.

Despite the affordability the pieces look anything other than cheap, with the statement necklaces dripping with mother of pearl and shell.

The collection took a futuristic feel and was entitiled Space Safari and the palette was made up purely of white and silver

For Amy, the collaboration means welcoming those who are so often excluded from the fashion industry.

'A lot of 16-year-old girls are fans of our brand and they aspire to it especially when they see celebs like Dasiy Lowe wearing our pieces. But the sad fact is they just can't afford it.'

However, this season could see that change with the intricate yet affordable pieces being readily available to the public.

'The jewellery will available to buy online' says Percy 'We wanted to bring high-end to the high-street.'

Given the futuristic nature of the collection it would seem that adding wearable technology to the range would have made perfect sense but for Amy, technology in fashion should involve changes in material rather than megabits.

The models channeled a new trend of glittery centre partings, fitting for the futuristic theme 

'I think that if there is a suggestion of technology such as new textures in fabric but if there is technology there just for the sake of it and the design is ugly then it is pointless.'

As if a clothing collection weren't enough PPQ also has it's own music label 1234 and for their SS15 show they enlisted one of their own DJs to create the sound track to the catwalk. 

'We always want to create something new and fresh when it comes to music' says Percy and Amy agrees.

'Yes and whatever it is it is always really close to home,'

The pair claim that their SS15 collection is very wearable despite the heavy metallic and suggest that it has a resort feel.

The designers are determined to increase PPQs wearability further as they announce plans for a further high street collaboration with online fashion brand Very.co.uk.

For Percy this collaboration is all about bringing down the exclusive nature of the fashion industry whilst maintaining quality.

'We want to be able to share our designs but on an affordable level' he says adding 'it's all about creating accessible elitism.'
