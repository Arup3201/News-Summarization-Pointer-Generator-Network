A man desperate to become a woman has shed a staggering 12 stone in her sex swap quest.

Keith Tonkin, who now goes by the Japanese name Hinoi, dropped from 21 stone to a svelte nine and is about to complete the sex swap she has always wanted.

The 29-year-old, who says she always felt different when she was a man, is awaiting the final stages of her £10,000 NHS operation, due to take place later in the year.

Hinoi Tonkin, who was born a man but is currently undergoing a gender reassignment programme, has lost 12 stone in weight to become the woman he always wanted to be

Speaking to The Sun, Hinoi said: 'I didn't act or think like other boys and that realisation meant I was miserable. I was binge eating to punish the body I hated so much.'

The IT specialist would stay 
in her room and gorge on eight fried eggs, eight pieces of toast and 
packets of crisps in the middle of the night because she was so 
miserable.

Realisation hit when her elder sister Sharon got married in 2006 and her other sister Pamela was a bridesmaid.

Hinoi said: 'I was so jealous of how they looked. I felt like an imposter in my suit, knowing I was living a lie.'

After
her mother found Hinoi wearing a skirt in 2009, she finally plucked up 
the courage to visit a gender clinic and underwent a course of drugs to 
block testosterone.

The computer programmer never felt confident in his body and felt like he was living a lie, when he saw his sisters at a wedding in their dresses, he decided it was time for a change

As she began to change into the 'new 
her', Hinoi ditched her fattening diet and swapped the fried food for 
diet shakes and salads, which she combined with mile-long daily walks.

Within
eighteen months, she became unrecognisable to anyone who had known her 
before and finally felt comfortable and confident in her body.

She
added: 'I can get into glamorous skirts and dresses and now I have 
these hips I love to shake them on the dancefloor- it's where I'm at my 
happiest.'

Hinoi changed her diet from fattening meals to diet shakes and took up more exercise to shift the unwanted pounds she had gained when she was unhappier
