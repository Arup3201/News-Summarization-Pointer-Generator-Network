A delivery driver has been sacked after he filmed himself driving behind an ambulance and bragging it is 'the quickest way to work'.

Danny Jones, 22, posted a video on his Facebook page of him following an ambulance along the A49 near Warrington, Cheshire.

In the mobile phone footage, he boasts: 'I appear to have found a quicker way to work. Everybody is beeping at me and I don't care.

Danny Jones was sacked from his job after posting a video of himself laughing and joking as he drove behind an ambulance on the A49

Mr Jones points the camera at other cars in the video and jokes: 'Pulling over, pulling over'

'Are you ready? This is the quickest way to work. Follow that f*****. That's what thou wants to do lads.'

Pointing at other cars, he says: 'Pulling over, pulling over, not me lad, I'm there, I'm on it, I'm going past. Ta-ra all.'

Mr Jones, from Wigan, Greater Manchester, adds: 'Know what I mean? And the Jones strikes again.'

The video attracted thousands of views, with Mr Jones quickly amassing more than 24,000 Facebook followers.

But he later faced an angry backlash from some viewers, before local authorities criticised his 'irresponsible actions'.

In the video, which Mr Jones posted on his Facebook page, he can be heard saying: 'That's what thou wants to do lads. And the Jones strikes again.'

His actions have been branded 'shocking and irresponsible' by road safety campaigners

Mr Jones now claims 'the video has been made out to be a lot worse than it actually is'

A spokesman for road safety charity Brake said: 'This is a shocking example of irresponsible driving.

'Anyone that uses a mobile phone behind the wheel is taking an unnecessary risk and increasing their chances of being involved in a serious crash.

'Emergency services personnel are specially trained to drive in emergency situations and trying to keep up with them is foolish, dangerous and potentially illegal.'

A representative of the North West Ambulance Service added: 'We do not condone any acts of dangerous driving as they can have serious consequences for both the driver and other road users.

'Our crews are trained to drive in emergency situations and to drive through traffic quickly and safely. It is not safe for a non-emergency vehicle to be driven in the same way.'

Mr Jones now says he has been unfairly vilified over the video and insists he did nothing illegal

He says he has struggled to find work since losing his job as a delivery driver over the video

Despite claiming his bosses found the video hilarious, he was sacked by the courier firm where he worked and is now looking for a new job.

Mr Jones later took down the video and posted the message: 'I have had a lot more positive responses than negatives from the video, but I've taken it down now and even deleted all of my other vidoes.

'I've got a credible driving licence and I don't want this to get any worse than it is - I have already lost my job because of videos I've posted on my Facebook page. And I have struggled to find a job since.'

He has since defended his driving and insisted he did nothing illegal.

The video was filmed along a stretch of the A49 towards Warrington, Cheshire

He said: 'I wasn’t actually doing anything wrong, the video has been made out to be a lot worse than it actually is - that was the purpose of the video but in reality I wasn’t doing anything wrong.

'I pulled over to let the ambulance past, I was driving under the speed limit, I didn’t go through any red lights.

'I wasn’t stopping the ambulance from doing its job and I wasn’t causing any issues as I made sure that I was keeping my distance.

'I was holding the steering wheel and my phone was in a holder while it was recording - I was driving safely, I knew it would be daft of me to do anything illegal in my vidoes.

'Really, I was just on my way to work and there happened to be an ambulance in front of me and I happened to be at the front of the line of cars and behind the ambulance.

'I have made the video out to be worse than it is, and made the situation worse for myself, by saying "this is the quickest way to get to work" and it has backfired on me.'
