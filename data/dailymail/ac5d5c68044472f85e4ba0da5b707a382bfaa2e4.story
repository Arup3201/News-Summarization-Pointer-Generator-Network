She has a wardrobe to rival Victoria Beckham's, wore a dazzling Alexander McQueen gown to tie the knot and is a member of the Royal family.

No, we're not talking about the Duchess of Cambridge, but another glossy member of the family who's been hiding in her shadow - until now.

Meet Sara Parker Bowles, the wife of food critic an Camilla's son Tom Parker Bowles.

The other stylish royal: Sara Parker Bowles is married to Camilla's son Tom and has a wardrobe even more enviable than the Duchess of Cambridge's

Sara, who married Tom back in 2005 in a dress designed by Sarah Burton in St. Nicholas' Anglican Church in Rotherfield Grey, Oxfordshire, has never been one to court the media's attention. 

'It's lovely to have all of that attention, but having everybody dissecting what you look like, what you're wearing - it's quite a strange thing,' she told The Telegraph's Ellie Plithers.  

However, away from the camera's glare, the 40-something stylista is making waves in the fashion industry. 

She worked as PA to Alexandra Shulman, the editor of British Vogue, but claims she was the 'worst PA in the world'.

Wedding style: Sara married Tom back in 2005 in a dress designed by Sarah Burton in St. Nicholas' Anglican Church in Rotherfield Grey, Oxfordshire, the same designer that created the Duchess of Cambridge's 

Part of the royal set: Sara, who holds a prestigious job at a glossy fashion magazine, says that Camilla is a very hands-on grandmother who loves to cook for the family

'Justine Picardie, who was deputy editor of Vogue at the time, totally saved me and took me into the features fold,' she told The Telegraph.

She now works as an associate editor of Harper's Bazaar, and senior editor of Town & Country magazine, as well as mothering her two children, Lola, 6, and son, Freddy, 4.

So does the Duchess of Cambridge seek style advice from her? 'We've talked about designers we admire in the past and she's always very complimentary about what I wear but, clearly, she feels she's got more important things to think about - and that's what makes her so endearing,' revealed Sara. 

Fashion's darling: Sara currently works as an associate editor at Harper's Bazaar and loves the tailored look - but she buys her shoes from sample sales! 

She seems quite at home in the Royal family, who she describes as a 'completely relaxed' set.

Sara revealed that  The Duchess of Cornwall is quite the hands-on grandmother who apparently loves to cook roast dinners and scrambled eggs for the whole family.

A regular on the front row, she loves to wear J Brand jeans - Kate's favourite - as well as  Christopher Kane shirts and tuxedo-style style blazers from the Olsen twins' brand The Row. 

As for accessories, only Celine totes will do and while she loves Manolo Blahnik, Jimmy Choo and Charlotte Olympia shoes, proving she's a down-to-earth fashion fan, she always snaps up the bargains at sample sales. 

We wonder if she ever grabs a pair or two for Kate.

Fashionable friends: Sara said that while she and Kate have talked about designers they admire in the past, Kate feels she's got more important things to think about - and that's what makes her so endearing
