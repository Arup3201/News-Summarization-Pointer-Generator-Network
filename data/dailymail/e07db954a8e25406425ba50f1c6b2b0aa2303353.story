Two military jets were scrambled last night after contact was lost with a private aeroplane in the skies above London.

The Royal Air Force aircraft - understood to be Typhoons - were deployed as a precaution after air traffic controllers were unable to communicate with the Learjet at about 7pm yesterday.

It was accompanied by the military aircraft to London Stansted Airport in Essex, where it landed safely shortly before 8pm.

An Essex Police spokesman said: ‘Military jets were deployed on a precautionary basis when a private jet was diverted to Stansted. This was due to a loss of communication with the aircraft.

‘The aircraft landed safely at Stansted Airport at 7.49pm. All three people who were on board have been spoken to by police, it was established that everything was in order and the police response was stood down.’

The Ministry of Defence confirmed the aircraft were deployed because of a break in radio contact but a spokesman stressed there was ‘no threat’.

The runway at the airport was shut for eight minutes before normal operations resumed.

A spokesman for air traffic control 
organisation Nats (National Air Traffic Services) said: ‘We couldn’t 
make voice communication with the aircraft which is why it was escorted 
to Stansted.’

An RAF spokesman told MailOnline: 'We can confirm that
Typhoon aircraft were launched from RAF Coningsby in their quick reaction alert
role last night to investigate a civilian light aircraft which had lost radio
contact with air traffic control.

'Post an uneventful interception, the civilian aircraft was
escorted to Stansted where it landed safely. The Typhoon aircraft then returned
to base.'

People living close to the airport last night reported hearing a loud noise - believed to be a sonic boom from a military jet.

'Was it me or did everyone just like hear a massive explosion in Stortford? My doors were open and my table rattled'

Supermarket commercial worker Stuart Debar, 25, of Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, said on Twitter: ‘Was it me or did everyone just like hear a massive explosion in Stortford? My doors were open and my table rattled.’

And Michael Attwell added: 'Explosion near Bishops Stortford? Thought the house had collapsed.'

However, the MoD later said there had not been a sonic boom. A scheduled Ryanair flight from Alicante in Spain, which was due to arrive at Stansted at 8pm last night, was diverted to Luton.

The two fighter planes had been scrambled from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire. An MoD spokesman told MailOnline that an event of this type happens around once every six weeks.
