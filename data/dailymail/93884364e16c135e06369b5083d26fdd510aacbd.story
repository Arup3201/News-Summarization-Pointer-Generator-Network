We will soon be able to watch live footage of Earth from outer space thanks to HD webcams that are about to be permanently fitted to the International Space Station.

The cameras blasted off from Russia today and once installed, will beam live footage of our planet to Earth.

People will be able to access the live footage on a website and the webcams could be used to provide high resolution imagery of the planet for environmental monitoring and to help with humanitarian relief efforts.

Canadian company UrtheCast's cameras were aboard a Russian Soyuz craft that launched from Kazakhstan's Baikonur Cosmodrome.

There are two cameras, the world's first 1-Metre Class, high-resolution Earth video camera and a medium-resolution imaging camera.

The firm behind the project says that anyone will be able to see the footage via a special website and customers will also be able to buy customised pictures.

Basic accounts are free and provide a live stream of imagery as the cameras fly overhead and time lapses of favourite places.

Premium accounts for enable users paying a fee to track an area without sharing it with others and to monitor larger areas of interest as well as applying image processing techniques to reveal data.

‘This is the biggest milestone UrtheCast has achieved thus far,’ explained co-founder, President and Chief Operating Officer, Wade Larson.

There are two cameras, the world's first 1-Metre 
Class, high-resolution Earth video camera and a medium-resolution 
imaging camera.

As the ISS circles the world 16 times per 
day, the two cameras will constantly be rolling and capturing unique 
videos and imagery of different locations underneath.

Phase 1 
of the project will see two cameras facing the ground, with one having a
 fixed gaze and the other one featuring maneuverability to points of 
interest.

‘This will be the world’s first ever high definition, live-streaming video platform of planet Earth from the International Space Station.’

Phase 1 of the project will see two cameras facing the ground, with one having a fixed gaze and the other one featuring maneuverability to points of interest.

These should be installed on the station sometime in December 2013, and are expected to go live in 2014.

The company’s aim is to make Earth video data more accessible to individuals and schoolchildren, who will be able to log in on UrtheCast’s website, as well as the traditional customers of government and private companies.

A recent partnership agreement with the UN will see them offer real-time information on dynamic situations such as floods and mass movements of people during humanitarian disasters.

‘Video and still image data captured by the cameras will be downlinked to ground stations across the planet and displayed on the UrtheCast web platform, or distributed directly to exclusive partners and customers,’ the firm said.

‘UrtheCast's cameras will provide high-resolution video and imagery of Earth that will allow for monitoring of the environment, humanitarian relief, social events and agricultural land.’

Current sponsors on the high profile project include the Discovery Channel, and the firm is working with the Russian Aerospace giant RSC Energia.

It is expected to take two spacewalks to install both cameras, and they will last for at least five years.
