Celebrity chef Aldo Zilli unveiled the world's most expensive kitchen last night - complete with a Swarovski Crystal chandelier, solid copper walls and handcrafted appliances.

The 'Fiore di Cristallo' kitchen, by leading designer Claudio Celiberti, took more than a year to craft from the pure crystal of Murano and the finest stone.

But such luxurious cooking space comes with an eight-month waiting list because of the bespoke design work involved and a hefty pricetag of £1m.

Height of luxury: The £1m 'Fiore di Cristallo' kitchen is the creation of designer Claudio Celiberti and was unveiled by celebrity chef Aldo Zilli in Mayfair last night. The world's most expensive kitchen, it comes with an eight-month waiting list. The centrepiece is a £36,850 'island' made from solid Murano crystal

Illuminating: The kitchen comes equipped with a £26,400 bespoke Swarovski chandelier, which projects light to bounce off the cut crystal cabinet fronts and worktops

The kitchen was launched at an exclusive party co-hosted by Mr Zilli at One Mayfair in London.

Buyers can choose opulent finishing touches, including copper lining, on the 27 cabinets, which cost over £400,000 to design and come with a 9mm crystal door and handle.

The centrepiece is a unique 'crystal island' worth £36,850, illuminated by a £26,400 Swarovski chandelier.

The basin is also made from crystal and costs £2,680, while the Philip Starck taps, chrome clad in crystal, are valued at £1,600.

Then you'll need a stretch of stone worktop at £6,850 and some handcrafted German appliances from Gaggenau at £24,000.

The fridge alone is £5,000, while extras including a wine climate cabinet and an espresso coffee machine are £2,762 and £1,714 respectively.

Opulence: The basin is worth £2,680 and comes fitted with £1,600 chrome taps clad in crystal by Philip Starck. The appliances, meanwhile, are custom made by the German company Gaggenau and will cost £24,000. This doesn't include the fridge (£5,000), wine cabinet (£2,762) or the coffee machine (£1,714) however

Crystal classy: All of the 27 cabinets in the 'Fiore di Cristallo' come fitted with Murano crystal handled and are fronted with a 9mm thick crystal door

Its designers say the kitchen 'aims to push the boundaries of what is possible in design' and is the 'perfect masterpiece using striking design qualities, exquisite natural materials and fine craftsmanship.'

The 'Fiore di Cristallo' on display last night is currently the only model available in the world but prospective buyers who want the kitchen designed to their needs must join the eight-month queue.

Speaking at the launch, Mr Zilli said: 'Claudio, in my mind, is an inspiration to all interior designers out there, whether you're designing a kitchen, a whole house and indeed one of my restaurants.

'As far as I am concerned this kitchen, the 'Fiore di Cristallo,' to me is the equivalent of a kilo of white truffles on my pasta.

'In other words, Claudio has combined innovative design with functionality faultlessly. This is ultimate luxury at its best.'

Top design: Like this fridge, the cabinets can be encased in copper, which is regarded as one of the most hygienic kitchen materials because it counteracts microbes

Mr Celiberti said: 'As a visionary designer who is committed to perfection, I wanted to create a bespoke space that pushed boundaries, exemplified beauty and defined ultimate luxury.

'The end result is a kitchen that is not only functional but also a work of art with each cut, component and flourish being nothing short of perfection, even down to the finest detail.'

The name derives from the 'Cristallo di Murano', the world famous gems made using a complex and closely guarded technique on the Italian island of Murano.

Copper linings were chosen because the mineral is acknowledged to have hygienic qualities as it counteracts harmful microbes.

The chandelier is specially designed to bounce light off the reflective crystal surfaces on the worktops, drawing attention to the kitchen.
