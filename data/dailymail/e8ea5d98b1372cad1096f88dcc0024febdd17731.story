These heartwarming pictures show how an injured reindeer calf was nursed back to health after being taken in by a doting couple who let her play in their garden and even doze on their rug.

Alan and Pauline Richards began caring for Tula after she was hurt in a vicious dog attack at the home of her owner Stella Wyburne-Ridsdale in St Mary’s on the Isles of Scilly off Cornwall.

Tula - whose parents are called Jingles and Belle - was in her owner’s paddock when a dog scared the reindeer’s mother and she accidentally stamped on her daughter, breaking her leg.

The reindeer was taken to a specialist vet on the mainland where her leg was put in a cast.

But Ms Wyburne-Ridsdale couldn’t afford to stay during the animal’s whole recovery - so asked her friend, Craig Richards, of Redruth, Cornwall, to look after her.

He took time off work to care for Tula, staying with her in his shed overnight and feeding her every two hours.

But when he had to return to his carpet-fitting job, he gave the reindeer to his parents, who live nearby, to look after during the day.

Ms Wyburne-Ridsdale said: ‘They had her for 10 weeks and gave her free run of the garden and the ground floor of their house.

'It was a once-in-a-lifetime chance for the family. I can’t thank them enough'

'Alan and Pauline are specialist carers for young adults with learning disabilities who loved to pet her.

‘It kept Tula socialised and it was a once-in-a-lifetime chance for the family. I can’t thank them enough.’

Tula is now back with her parents in St Mary’s, where Ms Wyburne-Ridsdale takes them for daily trips to the beach to bathe and eat seaweed.
