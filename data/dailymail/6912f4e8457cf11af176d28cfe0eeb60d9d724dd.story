'Everyone who has been married knows it is work and we have that times three.' These are the words of Michael Crawley, a Mormon living in Centennial Park, Arizona, with his three wives.

He and some of the other 1,500 Mormons living in the commune have given Channel 4 an unprecedented insight into their lives for a new documentary starting this evening, Three Wives, One Husband: Married to the Mormons.

Michael reveals that he 'truly' loves each of his three wives - Rose, Connie and Teresa - but it hasn't always been easy adapting each time their family has expanded, both emotionally and financially.

Big family: Michael Cawley has three wives and 18 children who he is struggling to support financially

He had been married to Rose for seven years before he then married Connie. Rose admits there was some 'conflict' when Connie first moved in but they persevered because they all believe they are following God's plan that they should be a family.

Rose said: 'Another person comes into the 
picture and you have to step aside and allow that relationship to 
develop. It's hard to allow that to happen.'

Connie added that fitting into an already established family wasn't easy for her either.

'The first couple of weeks after I
 got married were a little bit awkward,' she admitted. 'But we really believe that this is 
where God wants us and he expects us to find a way to work it out.'

Another seven years later, Teresa also married Michael. She said being part of a polygamous family 'is one of the 
most difficult things I have ever chosen to do but I would not choose 
another way to live.'

Had to step aside: Michael's first wife, Rose, pictured feeding some of their children, said it hasn't been easy adapting to her husband taking two more wives

The three women have 18 children between them with Michael but all insist they are happy and wouldn't want to live any other way.

But Michael reveals that as much as he loves his three spouses, caring for them and their offspring puts him under immense financial strain.

He and Rose work full time to feed the family who get through 12 gallons of milk a week and 15 dozen eggs, with a weekly shopping bill of around $900.

He said: 'I can't keep up with the needs of the family, it's not possible.'

His solution is for Connie to go back to work leaving just Teresa holding the babies and ensuring the smooth running of a home with 18 children.

The documentary reveals how Mormon marriages take place after the woman is given divine inspiration from God on who her husband should be. A young woman could be married to another young man ready to start a family or could just as likely become the third wife of a man three times her age who already has wives and children.

Becca Thompson, 22, who married Isaiah Thompson, 30, when he already had a wife and four children, said she had no qualms about becoming second wife when she received her calling from God.

She said: 'One day I was sitting in church and 
Isaiah walked in. A feeling came across me that he was who I was 
supposed to marry. I knew he had a wife. It's awesome that women here 
can get married to a man who is already married.

'I grew up in a big 
family and I loved it, my dad has six wives and I have 46 siblings.'

Isaiah's first wife, Marleen, admitted the arrival of Becca in her family home wasn't easy.

She said: 'I was nervous about the change that was about to happen, she's a lot younger than I am.'

Isaiah explains how their union works on a nightly basis: 'l sleep with Marleen two nights in a row then Becca two nights in a row.'

Marleen elaborates: 'We each have our own rooms. If 
I'm sleeping alone I'll sleep in mine and if I'm sleeping with Isaiah 
I'll sleep in his.'

Marleen hints that the nights she spends away from her husband - knowing he is sleeping with another woman - evokes varies feelings.

She said: 'Jealousy is normal human emotion. Different fears 
like "would he ever toss me aside?" go through every woman's brain.'

Arthur Hammon with two of his three wives: He's teaching the next generation of Mormons that polygamy  and 'placement' marriages lead to happiness

Isaiah had a baby with Becca, bringing his total number of children to five, but he reveals on this evening's documentary that he would like another. 'Pick her!' quips mother-of-four Marleen when he broaches the subject of motherhood with them.

Meanwhile, the first episode of the series explains how young men keen to start a family have to become missionaries first. They are taught how to be good husbands and are banned from dating or even growing a beard.

They will remain missionaries until the Mormon leaders, 'the brethren' inform them they can marry.

One young man, who has been a missionary for three-and-a-half-years, finds out he has been given a bride on this evening's show.

'Her name is Kelly and that's all I know about her,' he says.

One of the Mormon leaders, Arthur Hammon, a fourth generation polyamgist with three wives, explains these 'placement' marriages are the best way to ensure a lasting union.

He is adamant that their way of life should continue, even though polygamy is against the law.

'A law officer could turn up with a 
warrant for my address. But we believe in minding our own business and 
think other people should do that same,' he said.

Explaining their system of 'placing' women with husbands, he said:  'We don't encourage young people to date... You think you can live on love? That's an
 impossibility at best. We encourage our children to reserve their 
feeling until they can be placed with confidence.'
