As officials gave the final go-ahead to Thursday's Orion launch of the capsule that could take man to Mars, Nasa unveiled another important part of the mission - its countdown clock,.

Last week, down came the countdown clock that dated back to the Apollo 12 moon shot in 1969 and signalled every space shuttle launch for 30 years. 

Today, the new clock, in the same exact spot at the Kennedy Space Center press site that, along with the nearby flag pole, had once earned national historic designation, was switched on for the first time.

The new clock is just as long at 26 feet, but a foot taller at 7 feet. 

It's the nation's first new spacecraft intended for true outer-space travel by humans since the Apollo moon program.

What better way to usher in this new era of exploration, NASA reasoned, than with the latest flat-screen gizmo.

So last week, down came the countdown clock that dated back to the Apollo 12 moon shot in 1969 and signaled every space shuttle launch for 30 years. 

And up went the new display in the same exact spot at the Kennedy Space Center press site that, along with the nearby flag pole, had once earned national historic designation.

The new clock is just as long at 26 feet, but a foot taller at 7 feet.

NASA spokesman George Diller said the old clock, while still working, had become too expensive to fix and maintain. Parts were hard to come by. (It used 349 light bulbs to illuminate the hours, minutes and seconds, the colons and the plus and minus signs.)

'It was just becoming an antique,' Diller said.

The new $280,000 display, similar to those used at sports stadiums, can provide multiple images in addition to the countdown time. 

'An electronic billboard,' explained Mike Bolger, a NASA ground systems manager.

On Tuesday, the countdown numbers ticked down in the lower right corner - far smaller than on the old familiar clock. 

But that's because the left half of the display showed a real-time, close-up image of the Delta IV rocket launch pad. 

In the upper right corner, the words 'Orion Test Flight' showed in red, sandwiched between an Orion emblem and the NASA logo.

NASA took pains to keep the scene basically the same, with the clock and flag pole, according to Diller. 

Even so, more than a few space-age veterans were sorry to see the old, familiar clock hauled off. Diller tried to be philosophical about the switch: 'We won't have to worry about changing the light bulbs anymore.'

Apollo 17's launch on Dec. 7, 1972, marked mankind's last trip to the moon - and the last crewed capsule to leave Earth's immediate vicinity.

During its December 4 test flight, the unmanned capsule will shoot more than 3,600 miles (5,790km) into space.

It will then take two big laps around Earth before re-entering the atmosphere at 20,000 mph (32,200 km/h) and parachuting into the Pacific off the San Diego coast. 

The Launch Abort System and upper stage, shown in the left of this image, have been transported to Cape Canaveral. Here, they will be joined with the Delta IV Heavy Rocket ahead of a test flight in December. The right image shows the stages Orion will go through during flight

During the two-orbit, four-hour mission, engineers will evaluate the systems critical to crew safety, the launch abort system, the heat shield and the parachute system. 

The data gathered during the mission will influence design decisions and validate existing computer models. 

The flight also will reduce overall mission risks and costs for later Orion flights.

The capsule will re-enter Earth's atmosphere generating temperatures as high as 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit, before splashing down in the Pacific Ocean.

This inaugural Orion - scheduled for a 7:05 a.m. EST send-off - will carry no crew during the 4 1/2-hour test flight and be confined to Earth orbit. 

But it will aim for a high point of 3,600 miles on the second loop of the planet, setting the spacecraft up for a 20,000-mph, 4,000-degree re-entry. Splashdown will occur in the Pacific, 600 miles southwest of San Diego.

Managers from United Launch Alliance (ULA) and Lockheed Martin gave a 'go' to proceed toward launch pending completion of open work during the Launch Readiness Review for Orion's flight test. The weather is forecast to be 60 percent 'go' for a scheduled liftoff at 7:05 a.m. EST on Thursday, Dec. 4. 

With Countdown Clock in the foreground, Space Shuttle Discovery lifts off at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral,  Nasa spokesman George Diller said the old clock, while still working, had become too expensive to fix and maintain.

For this launch, a Delta IV rocket will do the heavy lifting.

Future Orions will be launched aboard NASA's still-in-development Space Launch System, or SLS, intended to carry astronauts to asteroids, Mars and beyond.

One plan calls for an asteroid to be corralled in orbit around the moon, so an Orion crew can explore the rock sometime in the 2020s. Mars expeditions would follow in the 2030s.

NASA is counting on the new countdown clock to be around for all that.

Traditionalists, meanwhile, can take heart.

The space center hopes to reassemble and display the old clock at its tourist stop next year.
