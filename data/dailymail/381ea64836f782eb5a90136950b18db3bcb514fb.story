This is the incredible moment a businesswoman was frantically treated by medics after an out-of-control car ploughed through her garden wall and crushed her.

Elena Berek, 46, was cleaning her £10,000 Chrysler Crossfire convertible in her driveway when she was rammed between her two cars after a Volkswagen Golf came off the road at 70mph.

The runaway vehicle rammed Miss Berek’s second Chrysler, leaving her wedged between two vehicles in the drive.

Crushed: Fireman attached a rope to the wheel of one of Miss Berek's Chryslers to try and pull the cars apart

Miss Berek, who runs a green energy company with her partner Maggie Wilshire, was trapped for an hour while rescue teams battled to free her from the wreckage.

Astonishing pictures show medics desperately treating Miss Berek for her injuries following the horror crash which happened outside her Coventry home on Sunday morning.

Injured: Miss Berek, who suffered a shattered pelvis and three broken bones in her left leg, runs a green energy business with her partner, Maggie

Police are hunting the driver of the black VW Golf who fled the scene on foot.

Miss Berek's partner, 59, who was inside their home at the time of the crash, said: 'I was doing the ironing when I heard this almighty explosion.

'Then all I could hear was Elena screaming my name and then there were bricks flying across the front of the window.

'At first I thought a bomb had gone off, it was terrifying but my only thought was to go to Elena.

'I ran outside and it was carnage - she was pinned between the two cars.

'I ran straight back inside to call 999 and then there were just people everywhere and they were all amazing.

'The police and ambulance arrived within minutes and it was such a fantastic response.

'It must have taken an hour before they managed to free Elena.

'Someone
 was saying that a neighbour further down the road heard her scream, so 
the driver must have heard it as well. He tried to drive off and to do 
that is just shocking.

'The
 driver was seen on his mobile phone after the crash but he could only 
drive the car into the next street before he dumped it and ran off.'

Elena has rushed to Coventry’s University Hospital with three broken bones in her left leg and a shattered pelvis.

Yesterday she was undergoing surgery to have pins inserted into her leg.

Maggie added: 'She was in a lot of pain, but her spirit is good. It’s a miracle she is alive.

'Seconds before the crash she was at the other side of the car next to the wall. If the car had hit her then she wouldn’t have stood a chance. She’s very lucky.'

Miss Berek's brother Tony, 40, was on the phone to her when the crash happened.

He said: 'She was on the phone to me and I heard her screams.

The Volkswagen veered off the road and knocked over the street sign before it sped towards the garden wall

Debris: The brick wall, which was demolished by the black Golf, lies in the street next to the dented Chrysler

Luxury car: The Chrysler Crossfire owned by Elena Berek which was badly damaged in the crash

'The Golf had come up Purcell Road at high speed - it must have been about 70mph for the sort of damage it has done.

'My sister was just getting in to her car when the Golf came up on to the grass verge, through the brick wall and smashed in to her car.

'She was stuck in the middle of the two cars.

'The lad in the Golf reversed and tried to drive off, but it was that badly damaged he couldn’t so he just ran off.

'I don’t think it’s hit yet how serious it is or how more serious it could have been. If it wasn’t for the brick wall she could be dead.'

West Midlands Police confirmed they were searching for the driver who was described as a white man with black hair in his early 20s.

'Explosion': Miss Berek's partner described how bricks flew over the bonnet, leaving dust marks covering the front of the vehicle
