Green Bay Packers defensive tackle Letroy Guion was arrested with more than a half-pound of marijuana, a handgun and $190,000 in cash Tuesday night, police say.

The 27-year-old defensive lineman is facing felony marijuana possession and  possession of a firearm charges after being stopped in his hometown of Starke, Florida, with two gallon bags of weed.

The Green Bay Press Gazette reports that around 11 p.m., an officer pulled Guion over after noticing him unable to maintain a single lane.

Flush: Cops say they smelled a 'strong odor' of marijuana from Guion's truck, where they also found more than a half-pound of marijuana and nearly $200,000 in cash

When the officer approached the 2015 Dodge Ram pickup, he states he smelled a 'strong odor' of marijuana.

Guion was already partially hanging out of the truck window and reportedly asked the officer if he knew who he was, according to the police report.

The lineman let officers know he was in possession of a firearm, a 9mm semi-automatic that was registered to his name, police say.

When officers kept searching the car, Guion became 'extremely uncooperative and hostile,' the report says, and 'kept coming near the truck several times saying, "Hey, man, my money is in there."'

After Guion 'rushed' to the passenger door and tried to remove a black backpack from the seat, officers handcuffed him, the report states. 

Inside the backpack, officers found two gallon-sized plastic bags filled with marijuana that weighed 357 grams in total along with $190,028.81, according to the police report.

Haul: Police seized the cash, which they say was in the backpack with the two gallon bags of marijuana, along with a semi-automatic firearm

Long-term: Guion had just finished his first season with the Packers after five years with the Minnesota Vikings, and though he began contract talks about a deal in Green Bay, these have likely been suspended

The money was seized as well, since it was in the backpack along with the marijuana, the report says.

Florida state law declares that possession of more than 20 grams of marijuana is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison. 

It is also a felony punishable by up to five years in prison to carry a concealed firearm without a license.

Guion just finished his first season with the Packers, where he had 32 tackles and 3.5 sacks after spending five seasons with the Minnesota Vikings.

The Packers were reportedly in talks with Guion about the possibility of inking a long-term deal with the defensive lineman, which are likely now suspended, ESPN reports. 

'We are aware of a serious matter involving Letroy Guion,' a spokesperson for the team said Wednesday morning. 'We have not yet spoken to Letroy and we will have no further comment.'
