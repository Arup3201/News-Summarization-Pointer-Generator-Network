The former director of a 'no-kill' animal shelter has been indicted for allegedly charging owners $100 not to euthanize their pets and then killing them anyway.

Lowanda 'Peanut' Kilby was charged on Wednesday with 60 felony counts including theft by taking, theft by 
deception, computer theft and racketeering after falsely promising 28 pet owners their animals wouldn't be killed.

The Georgia woman is also charged with stealing more than $10,500 in funds from  Boggs Mountain Humane Shelter, which was closed last year after a TV expos√©.

Fraudulent: Lowanda 'Peanut' Kilby was charged on Wednesday with 60 felony counts including theft by taking, theft by deception, computer theft and racketeering after falsely promising 28 pet owners their animals wouldn't be killed

Kilby was free on $100,000 bond yesterday following the Rabun County grand jury indictment.

Euthanizing animals isn't a crime in Georgia, so none of the counts relate to animal cruelty in the shelter's Lucky Dog-Lucky Kitty program, according to NBC News.

Kilby and Penny Burkitt, the shelter's 
executive director, resigned in August 2012 after WAGA-TV exposed the 
shelter's dodgy dealings.

Authorities spent 14 months thoroughly investigating the not-for-profit center.

According to the shelter's website, Kilby had been the center's director for four years before she was dismissed.

'Almost everyone in Rabun County knows Peanut and her family,' the website says about Kilby.

'She is personable, professional and a true animal lover. She is very motivated, and is interested in improving the Educational Program and adding a rescue service for equines.'

The Clayton Tribune reported the indictment alleges Kilby used stole donations intended for the shelter 
through PayPal and transferred the money into her personal 
accounts.

The indictment also alleges that Kilby unlawfully acquired $3,035 worth of 
Boggs Mountain property through racketeering, and took more than $10,000 that was intended for animal adoptions.

Kilby or workers at the shelter also reportedly assured pet owners through hand-written notes and emails that their pets would be adopted when they were already dead, Huffington Post reported.

'We do feel awful for all the dogs that were euthanized when people were
told the dogs were adopted, and especially for people who received 
emails after the dogs had been euthanized saying that their dogs had 
been adopted,' Assistant District Attorney Maggie Hastings said.

The names of the 16 dogs and 12 cats put
to sleep were: Buddy, Georgie, Brady, Tug, Tank, Red, Spot, Jake, 
Ginger, Denver, Toshie, Kelly, Dixie, Roger, Nora, Spike, Boss, Lola, 
Oreo, Sally, Pookie, Brownie, Thor, Jenny, Molly, Tuxedo, Jersey and 
Bart.

NBC News reported the Lucky Dog-Lucky Kitty program was taken over by the nonprofit Rabun Paws 4 Life Animal Shelter under a $60,000 contract with the county.

A conviction under Georgia's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act carries a prison sentence of up to 20 years, while those convicted with felony theft by taking and computer theft face up to 15 years.
