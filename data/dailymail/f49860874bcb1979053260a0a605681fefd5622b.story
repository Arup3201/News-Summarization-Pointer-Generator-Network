Chantelle Houghton has split up with fiancé Alex Reid just two days after he was arrested at their home in Brentwood.

The 29-year-old took to Twitter this afternoon (Friday) to inform fans that she felt she had no choice but to split from the cage fighter.

Chantelle posted: 'Unfortunately I have had no option but to end my relationship with Alex.'

Taking out the trash: Chantelle Houghton, seen here today (Thursday), has binned fiancé Alex Reid just two days after he was arrested at their home

All over: Chantelle used Twitter to tell fans she had split from the cage fighter

The Celebrity Big Brother contestant's decision comes after Alex was spotted collecting
a Chinese takeaway from the door of the property last night (Thursday) 
suggesting that the pair had put their differences to one side.

The
37-year-old cage fighter handed over a £20 note as he received his 
meal, perhaps hoping a romantic night in with a chicken chow mein would 
help rekindle his ailing relationship.

But it was clear that Chantelle was distraught and was pictured showing the strain as she made her way home later that evening.

Doing his bit: Alex was spotted putting the bins out near the couple's home earlier this morning (Friday)

Wearing a thick black hooded jumper in 
spite of the warm weather, the blonde looked tired and drawn as she 
attempted to shield her face from photographers with her shopping bags.

But
it would seem Alex is trying to do his bit around the house as the 
couple attempt to move forward with their relationship, with the martial
arts star spotted putting the bins out this morning, wearing a pair of 
brightly-coloured pyjama bottoms and a hooded jumper.

Yesterday
afternoon, the couple stepped out for the first time since Alex's 
arrest and the stress of the last few days was clear to see on 
Chantelle's face.

So good to see you! Chantelle and Dolly were later seen arriving at her mother's house

There was no doubt the usually bubbly
blonde looked a far cry from her normal self, with her downcast 
expression proving just how painful the experience has been for her.

But ever the doting mother, the 
former Celebrity Big Brother star lavished attention on her 
two-month-old daughter Dolly as she prepared to drive off in her Range 
Rover.

Dressed in a pair of leather panel leggings with a black mesh long-sleeve top and simple flat sandals, the star was evidently determined not to let the events of the last few days get in the way of her mothering duties.

Back in the fold: Alex Reid's face was clear to see through the glass panel in the door, suggesting he has moved back in to the Essex home he shares with Chantelle Houghton 

With
little Dolly in tow, Chantelle made her way to a local branch of 
Mothercare, where she picked up a birthday present ahead of taking her 
little one to a party later in the afternoon.

Alex was arrested on suspicion of causing criminal damage at the couple's home in the early hours of Wednesday morning.

And neighbours have told how they were woken
in the middle of the night by a 'screaming' Alex attempting to force his way in 
to the property.

Moving on: Alex Reid kept his head down as he stepped out for the first time since his arrest earlier today

One told the Daily Star: 'I could hear a man shouting and when I looked out I saw Alex Reid.

'He was screaming, "Let me in, 
f***ing let me in.’ Other people living in the street must have woken up
because I saw a few lights go on".'

Meanwhile, another neighbour admitted to finding the incident 'quite frightening'.

Stressed: The worry of the past few days was evident on Chantelle's face as she stepped out for the first time since Alex Reid's arrest

Doting: Chantelle put on a brave face as she took little Dolly to a birthday party this afternoon

She
added: 'I’m used to them making noise late at night but I only usually 
hear cars coming back and forth and sometimes a bit of loud talking.

'This time I heard banging and lots of shouting. I live on my own so it was quite frightening.'

Alex has since been released by Essex Police without charge.

In
a statement on his official website, he said: 'In the early hours of 
this morning Alex was arrested at the address he shares with his 
partner, Chantelle Houghton after she called police following a 
disturbance.

Released without charge: Police have decided to take no further action after being called to the Essex home Alex Reid shares with Chantelle Houghton in the early hours of yesterday morning

No comment: Alex Reid posted a statement about the incident on his official website

'The reasons for Alex’s arrest have been widely publicised and in some cases inaccurate and based on conjecture.

'Alex considers this a private matter and therefore is not prepared to comment on it save to say that he assisted police with their inquiries and following that, the police have taken no further action.'

In recent weeks, the couple have made
no secret of the fact their relationship has been under strain 
following the birth of their 11-week-old daughter, Dolly, in June.

Chantelle told the new issue of OK! magazine: 'Things have been really strained. There's never a day without drama.'

Questions: Police were spotted leaving Alex and Chantelle's Essex home yesterday afternoon (Wednesday)

In an interview with New! magazine 
this week, Alex admitted he had made mistakes in his relationship with 
Chantelle, saying: 'I’m doing everything in my power to make it work. 
I’ve made bad mistakes and choices.'

The couple have been dating for 16 months, and have run into several problems throughout the course of their relationship.

Chantelle 
was furious when she discovered Alex had been exchanging private, but 
innocent, Twitter messages with model Amy Willerton - former protegee of
his ex-wife Katie Price.

The
former Paris Hilton lookalike also admitted she was upset after seeing 
pictures of Alex being groped by a drag queen as he performed in a gay 
club.

New mum: Chantelle and Alex welcomed baby daughter Dolly into the world in June

A few weeks 
before baby Dolly was born, Alex briefly moved out of the couple's Essex
home, and again left the property for three days last month.

A
spokesperson for the couple declined to comment to MailOnline on 
whether Alex and Chantelle are living together full-time again.

Both Alex and Chantelle have suffered failed marriages. The cage fighter was previously married to Katie Price, but she dumped him before they were even married for a year while Chantelle's marriage to Ordinary Boys singer Preston also failed to pass the 12-month mark.
