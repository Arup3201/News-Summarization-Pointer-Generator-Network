Caroline Wozniacki came through a tough test in her first-round match at the Australian Open - but turned her attention to her beloved Liverpool afterwards as she revealed her sadness at Steven Gerrard's departure.

Wozniacki was pushed hard in the first set by 18-year-old Taylor Townsend but eventually went on to secure a 7-6 (7-1), 6-2 victory to progress to the last 64 on Tuesday.

But the post-match discussion was not all about tennis as Gerrard's impending summer switch to LA Galaxy was brought up in Wozniacki's press conference.

But now that Gerrard is due to leave the Anfield club, Wozniacki is considering a trip to Los Angeles to watch him in action in MLS.

Wozniacki said: 'I'm obviously sad. I think Stevie has done so much for the team over the years.

'He's a legend. I think if that's what he thinks is the right time, I have to support that.

'But at the same time he had a talk with the manager and said that maybe he wasn't going to be playing as much.

'Yeah, I'm a little sad. I'm going to have my Stevie G jerseys hanging somewhere.

'Unfortunately he won't be playing there anymore. I'll have to make a trip probably to LA to have a look again.'

Wozniacki beat Taylor 7-6 (7-1), 6-2 to progress to the second round of the Australian Open

After losing the final of the US Open to good friend Serena Wiliams last September, former world No 1 Wozniacki is still bidding to win her maiden Grand Slam.

The 24-year-old's first match in Melbourne was hard work against American rising star Townsend, who three years ago was controversially asked by the USTA to sit out of the US Open junior event due to her weight.

But Townsend has put that behind her to climb into the top 100 and she further showed her future promise by providing a stiff challenge for Wozniacki on the Margaret Court Arena.

The pair exchanged breaks in the first set before Townsend got tight in the tie-break and Wozniacki took advantage to move a set ahead.

Wozniacki then made just four unforced errors in the second set as she went on to wrap up the win in one hour and 32 minutes.

Wozniacki is currently ranked as the World No 8 and is bidding to win her first Grand Slam title

She said: 'It was a tough match. You just want to get through that first round really. You saw yesterday how many seeds went out. You always know that first one, maybe it's not going to be that comfortable.

'I just needed to grind it out and just stay with her. I'm happy to be through and on to the next one.'

Wozniacki's victory sets up a blockbuster second-round match on Thursday against Victoria Azarenka, who has won the title here twice in the last three years but is unseeded due to her long lay-off last year with a foot injury.

Wozniacki said: 'It's going to be tough. She's won here before. It's not the easiest on paper.

'But at the same time I'm just going to focus on myself, my own game. Honestly, whether you have to beat her in the second round or fourth round, whatever, doesn't matter if you want to win the tournament.'
