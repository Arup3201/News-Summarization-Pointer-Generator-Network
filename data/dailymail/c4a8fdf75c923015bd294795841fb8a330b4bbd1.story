One of Britain's top gymnastics coaches is facing jail for sexually abusing six teenage girls over the past 40 years.

Bob Bellew has published books on the sport, taught at schools across London and was a former Community Coach of the Year.

He also served on committees planning the London Olympics and was the Chief Coach of Tower Hamlets Schools Gymnastics and Dance Display Team.

Guilty: Bob Bellew appeared at Snaresbrook Crown Court in London where he admitted groping girls

The 66-year-old was even awarded 'The Order of the Smile,' a UN recognised citation for 'adults distinguished in their love, care and aid of children'.

But for decades the respected coach preyed on the girls he was tutoring, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard.

He admitted groping the girls, aged from 13 to 15, between September 18, 1970, and December 14, 2010.

Some of the assaults took place during trips abroad and during gymnastics classes. 

Bellew admitted eight of 17 charges against him, involving six victims and stretching back to 1970 at a short hearing at Snaresbrook Crown Court.

He confessed to touching and placing his foot under a girl's private parts, rubbing their thighs and prodding and patting their bottoms.

Bellew, from New Cross, southeast London, admitted seven counts of indecent assault and one of sexual touching.

The charges he denies will be left to lie on file, and he will be sentenced for the eight he has admitted on April 11. 

He was released on bail on the condition that he does not contact any of the victims.

Bellew has published books on gymnastic coaching including the title Gymnastics: A Flying Start in 1993.
