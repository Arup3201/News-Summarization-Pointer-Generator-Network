Galatasaray have been fined 50,000 Euros (£40,000) for the setting off and throwing of fireworks and missiles during their Champions League match with Arsenal on October 1, UEFA has announced.

The proceedings against the Gunners have been dropped. 

The London club had been charged with "insufficient organisation (lack of body searching)" after fireworks and missiles were thrown on to the Emirates Stadium pitch during the 4-1 home win.
