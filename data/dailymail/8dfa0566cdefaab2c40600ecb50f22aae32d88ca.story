Ander Herrera believes Manchester United have the best strike force in the world, which is some claim considering what other predators are lurking out there.

The Spaniard, in discussing his excitement at playing alongside Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao, said: ‘I think we have maybe the best three strikers in the world here in Rooney, van Persie and Falcao.’

But can that trio compare to Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale? How does it rate against what might be a remarkable combination of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez, once the latter returns from suspension?

Then there’s Zlatan Ibrahimovic and his understudies at Paris Saint-Germain. And the mixture of elegance and killer instinct at Chelsea. The wide boys at Bayern also make a compelling case.

Here, Sportsmail rules on the best forward lines in the game.

MANCHESTER UNITED

Big names, but yet to live up to Herrera’s billing. All three have rightly been considered world class at one time or another but how close are they to their respective peaks? 

And how much is reflective of the inadequacies behind them? Van Persie, at 31, does not quite look like the same brilliant player he was in his first Old Trafford season, while Falcao has not yet hit his stride. 

On his day he is perhaps the most lethal finisher in the game. This trio needs more time and extra support. 

BARCELONA 

South Americans Neymar and Lionel Messi are two of Barcelona's formidable front three 

Luis Suarez is yet to play a competitive game for Barcelona following his ban for biting during the World Cup 

In theory, and according to our ratings, this is the best line-up in the world. Suarez remains an unknown, owing to the ongoing uncertainty over how he will fit in with a new team and the role that he will play. 

He will stand alongside arguably the greatest player in history, in Messi, who has already scored six and made six in seven La Liga games.

Neymar isn’t bad, either. In fact, the Brazilian’s strike-rate of a goal every 49 minutes is bettered only by Ronaldo (of players who have played more than once). It remains to be seen if the attack is worth more than the sum of its parts, but they are extremely talented parts.

MANCHESTER CITY

Samir Nasri and David Silva played a key role in Manchester City winning the title last season 

Sportsmail’s Jamie Carragher recently listed David Silva as one of the Premier League’s best 11 imports and rightly so. He is a master of evasion, so clever in his runs, passing and ability to find space, but he could still score more goals. 

Sergio Aguero is the man who makes the tangible difference and already has an excellent record this season. At 26, he is heading into the fabled peak time of his career. 

Samir Nasri, at 27, has played more than 250 games in English football, but is currently injured. 

CHELSEA 

Diego Costa has made an immediate impact at Chelsea and has scored nine goals so far this season

In Eden Hazard, Chelsea have one of the best, most dynamic dribblers in Europe. A man of small stature and questionable work rate, he scores goals and he makes them.

Oscar, meanwhile, is rapidly emerging and, perhaps predictably, has drawn comparisons to Frank Lampard.

The crown jewel, without dispute, is Diego Costa. He is what Chelsea so badly needed and what they so badly failed to find for a number of years – a striker worth comparing to Didier Drogba. Arsene Wenger described him this month as a ‘killer’ and his goals ratio proves the point. The best striker in the Premier League.

BAYERN MUNICH 

Robert Lewandowski and Arjen Robben have formed a good partnership for Bayern this season

Franck Ribery has only played once this season due to injury - but he still scored, against Stuttgart

Franck Ribery has played less than one full game because of injury so it is hard to know what to expect from the brilliant Frenchman, who is now 31 and has been central to Bayern Munich’s rise to the top. 

With Arjen Robben in the same side, it is possible to argue Bayern have the best wide players of any side. The Dutchman is perhaps the strongest candidate for the ‘third best player in the world’ candidate and has already scored three Bundesliga goals and made two more this season.

Robert Lewandowski has done well since joining Bayern, scoring four league goals in three games and also making two, having notched more than 20 Bundesliga strikes in each of his past three seasons. 

REAL MADRID

French striler Karim Benzema and Wales forward Gareth Bale make up Real's lethal attack

In Benzema, the Madrid giants have a fine player made to look modest by comparisons with two stars. Ronaldo is the best player in the world on current form, an astonishing athlete who has already scored three hat-tricks this season.

If Messi is the greatest of all time, then Ronaldo cannot be too far behind. Then there is Bale. There were suggestions in Spain this season that he does not work hard enough.

Carlo Ancelotti dismissed those and has watched the £86m man score four and make three this season. He is one of the fastest men in football and at 25 is evidently getting better.

PARIS SAINT-GERMAIN

PSG's Brazilian flier Lucas Moura, in action against Monaco, is  the French champions' other attacking option

Winger Lucas Moura has not lived up to the hype following his reported £44m move from Sao Paulo in 2012 – Manchester United were keen – and his struggles were demonstrated during the first game of the season when Ibrahimovic tore strips off him.

Edinson Cavani has justified his own huge price tag in a more convincing manner, scoring 25 in 43 games last season having been prolific at Napoli. 

It goes without saying that Ibrahimovic is the star. At 33, he is still magnificent. His five goals from five games this season takes his PSG ratio in all competitions to 83 in 94 games. He belongs in a better league.
