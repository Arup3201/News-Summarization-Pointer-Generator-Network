A new book makes shocking new claims that 'coked-up' members of the New York Knicks' 1981-1982 team fixed games for their drug dealer, who bet thousands of dollars on the team in the midst of their terrible season.

Brian Tuohy's new book, Larceny Games: Sports Gambling, Game Fixing and the FBI, cites FBI sources who said they investigated whether three members of the team - who were said to be 'heavy users of cocaine' - were involved in a point-shaving scheme to benefit their supplier, who is identified only as 'one of the largest dealers on the East Coast.' 

According to Tuohy's FBI sources, the dealer was known as a degenerate sports gambler who typically bet $300 a game on NBA games. When it appeared he had his hooks in some of the Knicks players - in roughly January of 1982 - the dealer began upping his bets to $10,000, often betting against the Knicks to win or cover the spread.

By March of 1982, the dealer had won six of the seven large bets he'd made against the Knicks - all while continuing to bet his regular $300 on games in which the Knicks were not playing.

'Over...the last two months, all three [players] have given...tips on when to bet the Knicks to lose. This has occurred seven times and six of the tips were good,' according to FBI files citing two unnamed sources.'

Simultaneously, the FBI began to suspect that the three Knicks players were 'betting against themselves,' with one of the men owing a 'large...gambling debt' to a bookie with the Luchese crime family.

'So many people say it’s impossible to fix a game because guys are paid so much money,' Tuohy told The New York Post. 'But you can see how easily they can get hooked on some drug, be gambling themselves and get in deep with a bookie.'

Addict: Michael Ray Richardson is suspected of possibly being one of the players who cheated, a charge he denies

Banned: Richardson was banned from the NBA for life in 1986 but now coaches a Canadian team

Point-shaving in basketball involves a player intentionally playing bad to make the final score closer than it otherwise would be, which helps gamblers beat the spread and win the bet.

At first, FBI agents didn't think the trio was actually shaving points, rather, 'extending a courtesy to their cocaine dealer regarding inside player information.'

As the dealer continued to be successful, in about March of 1982, FBI agents noted that a 'source now believes that the players are actively engaging in "shaving points" and possibly even betting against themselves.'

'Source observed heavy betting by [redacted] toward the latter part of the season...on the Knicks to lose certain games. In each case, the Knicks did lose, or failed to cover the point spread,' the FBI file reads.

The names of the players are redacted from the report, but one of those suspected of possibly being involved in the alleged point-shaving scheme is guard Michael Ray Richardson, who was banned from the NBA for life in 1986 for violating the league's drug policy three times.

Coach: Some on the team attribute the poor performance to a lack of leadership from coach Red Holzman

Richardson averaged 18 points a game, despite a rumored cocaine problem. When the team finished in last in the Atlantic Division - after going 33-49 in the regular season - Richardson was quoted as saying 'the ship be sinking.'

Richardson - who now coaches the London Lightning in the NBL in Canada - denies that he was ever involved in a point-shaving scheme, telling the Post 'hell no...we never did anything like that.'

Others blame the poor performance on the leadership of coach Red Holzman, who players have said didn't do much to motivate his players.

'At times the coach was a little lax, and he didn’t put enough pressure 
on those guys [to play harder],' said Alex Bradley, a Knicks rookie during the season in question. 'At certain times, when we needed to turn it up, it 
just wasn’t there.'

Tuohy, however, doesn't buy it.

'It was no coincidence,' he said when asked about other possible explanations for the teams atrocious season.
