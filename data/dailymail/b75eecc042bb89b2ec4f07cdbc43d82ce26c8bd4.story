Comic Al Murray is standing against Nigel Farage in Thanet South, Kent

TV comic Al Murray took a leaf out of the election book of political rival Nigel Farage today – by making his first campaign stop in a pub.

The Oxford-educated stand-up, who is standing for Parliament against the Ukip leader in his guise as The Pub Landlord, hit to the campaign trail for the first time.

The star - whose creation is famed for extolling the joys of all things British - is standing in South Thanet for his newly-formed Free United Kingdom Party.

He launched his bid to win over voters by kissing the ground after arriving in Kent this morning.

He travelled by train to the seaside towns of Margate, Broadstairs and Ramsgate in Kent.

Arriving at Margate railway station, he fired off his first gag in character, tweeting: 'Just arrived in Margate. Great to be back in Essex.' 

He then promptly visited a pub, a brewery and a school in the Kent constituency.

In his trademark burgundy-coloured blazer, he stepped out from a people carrier and told reporters outside Thanet District Council's offices in Margate that his party represented 'rational common sense'.

He then went on to outline some of his pledges, including making Thanet the capital city and bringing HS7 to the area.

On why he chose Thanet, he said: 'I heard destiny's call like a trumpet in the far distance and it sounded like it was saying Thanet, so Thanet had to be the place.'

He added: 'If I were to win then I would definitely open a pub because I'm going to nationalise pubs if I get the chance.'

Murray scoffed at a question about whether he had a dry January like his political opponent Mr Farage, and spoke of his plans to 'demilitarise' North and South Thanet.

'Why can't North and South Thanet walk in harmony together,' he said.

On expenses, he said: 'They say there is no such thing as a free lunch but if you are an MP it looks like there are free dinners as well.'

Oxford-educated Murray, 46, last month launched an action plan under the guise of his patriotic character in his bid to reach Parliament.

He has included a pledge that the UK will leave Europe by 2025 'and the edge of the Solar System by 2050'.

And he also has ideas on law and order, with a promise to tackle crime by locking up all unemployed people.

On the hot topic of immigration, he plans to stop people reaching the shores of 'the greatest country in the world' by bricking up the Channel Tunnel - with British bricks and using Polish labour.

And in a further bid to win over wavering voters, he promises '1p a pint', although 'crisps will remain at the current price'.

A website has been set up for his campaign, carrying the slogan: 'Other parties offer the moon on a stick. We'll do better than that: a British moon on a British stick.'

CURRENCY

The pound will be revalued at £1.10, so it will now be worth 10p more.

NHS 

If you come to A&E and it's neither an accident nor an emergency, then you will be sent to a random hospital department to be practised on.

FOREIGN POLICY 

Germany has been too quiet for too long. Just saying.

IMMIGRATION 

The reason they are coming here is because this is the greatest country in the world. The only way to stop them is for a government to change that and make things a whole lot worse.

EUROPE

Greece to be bought and operated by Kent County Council. Couldn't be worse. Someone to do the bins at least.

LAW AND ORDER

Unemployment causes crime: I propose to lock up the unemployed.

Murray is standing in a constituency which the Conservative Party won from Labour at the previous election in 2010.

It is already the focus of huge attention due to Mr Farage's decision to stand there as Ukip experiences a surge in support and now has two Parliamentary seats.

Ukip has welcomed the intervention of The Pub Landlord, with a spokesman for the Eurosceptics saying: 'At last, serious competition in the constituency.' 

And Mr Farage has said: 'The more, the merrier.'

Bookmaker's Ladbrokes last month installed the comedian as a 66/1 chance to take the seat, and evens to outpoll the Lib Dems, with Mr Farage remaining the firm odds on favourite to take the seat from the Conservatives.

William Hill also made FUKP the fourth favourite behind Labour but still consider Murray odds on not to get sufficient votes to retain the £500 deposit candidates must pay to take part.

South Thanet, which includes the coastal towns of Ramsgate, Sandwich and Broadstairs, has previously enjoyed a reputation as an electoral bellwether - held at every election since 1983 by the party that has formed the government of the day.

In 2010 Tory Laura Sandys ousted Labour former minister Stephen Ladyman, who had held the seat since Tony Blair's 1997 landslide when he defeated the constituency's most high-profile former MP, the Tory ex-Cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken, who two years later was jailed for perjury.

Kent-born Mr Farage stood in South Thanet in 2005, only to finish fourth with 2,079 votes, a 5% share.

But Ukip's recent electoral success has made victory in the seat a very real prospect, with the party performing strongly in Kent in last year's European elections.

Across the Thanet District Council area Ukip topped the poll, with 16,492 votes, more than double the votes cast for the second-placed Tories. The Free United Kingdom Party's logo features an upturned pound sign, in a clear parody of the Ukip symbol.

Murray is not the only celebrity to bidding for a seat in Parliament on May 7. The Happy Mondays dancer Bez - real name Mark Berry - is standing for election for the Reality Party in Salford.

The Pub Landlord Al Murray was given a warm welcome by South Thanet voters despite the weather

The stand-up comic spoke to students at Charles Dickens School in Broadstairs, Kent

During his visit to the Charles Dickens School in Broadstairs, Murray said he was meeting 'the adults of tomorrow' to tell them about 'their chance to change this nation from Great Britain to Amazing Britain'.

Asked how seriously he was taking the election campaign, he said: 'Well, only a fool wouldn't take the general election seriously. And a vote for me is a vote for common sense.

'I am the only one taking the General Election seriously – there are too many jokers in politics.' 

When asked his view on Greece's economy, he told pupils: 'You have to admire them standing up to the Germans.'

The comedian told Kent Online: 'It was fantastic to see all of the young voters at the school, although only one of the children present would be eligible to vote at the next election.

'So in fact it was a complete waste of time – but in a very positive way.' 

He also unveiled an advertising hoarding in true election campaign style with the slogan: 'Vote Common Sense, Vote Guv for Guv'norment.' 

While on the Kent-bound train, the FUKP leader tweeted: 'The #FUKP team ready to go tell the people of Thanet what they want to hear.'

'Thanet? Well Thanet has all the charms of the Garden of England, picturesque towns, delightful hostelries, as well as the benefits of being on the coast: the place is a double whammy.

'And then there's the people, always welcoming, ever charming, never downhearted.'

Mr Murray says he is standing for the Free United Kingdom Party because it is time 'for a bloke waving a pint offering common sense solutions'.
