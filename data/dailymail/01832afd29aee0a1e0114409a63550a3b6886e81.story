G4S’s ‘management fee’ for the Olympics was increased almost tenfold to £60million despite the firm failing to provide enough security staff to protect London 2012. 

Games organisers Locog agreed to raise it from £7.3 million to £60million, according to secret documents revealed today.

Almost £34million of the rise was for the G4S ‘programme management office’ to oversee the security operation, but it was so poorly handled 3,500 armed forces staff have now had to be rushed in.

It came as it also emerged hundreds of A-level students have been hired as front-line guards at the Games to fill the security void when it starts in two weeks.

Claims: G4S has allegedly increased its management fees almost tenfold despite failing to find enough staff to secure venues like the Olympic Stadium

They are among 3,300 teenagers recruited from colleges around Britain to help form a ring of steel at the venues for £8.50 an hour.

Security experts expressed alarm that youngsters aged 18 and 19 had been entrusted with searching spectators and bags.

G4S' management fee is thought to be almost ten times the amount that the firm has invested in recruiting security personnel for the games.

It was initially estimated by the Home Office that 10,000 security staff would be needed for the Olympics.

G4S was contracted to provide 2,000 of those staff in 2010 at a cost of £86 million.

Falling short: G4S admitted it could not supply the 10,000 guards it promised to deliver but has raised its management fee to £60million

But when the overall number of personnel required for the Games rose to 23,500 last year, G4S was asked to provide 10,400 recruits.

Under the new contract with Locog, the organisers of London 2012, the security company’s overall fee rose to £284 million.

The contract stipulated that G4S should train 3,300 students and 2,500 unpaid workers.

A steward sub-contracted to work for under-fire security provider G4S at the British Grand Prix was arrested for stealing a camera from a spectator’s bag.

The man, believed to be from London, was arrested after a visitor to the Silverstone race realised the camera was missing from his bag.

Northamptonshire Police have today confirmed they investigated the incident and arrested the man.

He was later issued with a reprimand.

The camera was later returned to the rightful owner.

But their management fee for recruiting civilian staff rose from £7.3 million to £60 million, according to documents seen by the Daily Telegraph,

However, the documents show that the firm’s spending on recruitment only increased by £2.8 million in the same period.

In a statement to ITV’s Tonight programme, G4S said they had been ‘absolutely transparent with Locog throughout’.

The company said that the ‘revised proposal was subject to rigorous scrutiny and extensive negotiation…to ensure value for money.’

The firm also said that the amended contract gives ‘significantly improved terms’ and that there are ‘caps on any profit that we will make’.

Meanwhile the beleaguered security firm suffered further share price falls today amid fears that the Olympics debacle will permanently damage its reputation.

Its shares fell 3% on top of similar falls yesterday, meaning more than £200 million has been wiped off its value since the staffing problems emerged.

Meanwhile, there are fears that chief executive Nick Buckles, who will be hauled before MPs next week, will be forced out.

He survived the collapse of a £5.2 billion takeover deal for Danish cleaning giant ISS last year after a shareholder rebellion scuppered the move, but the latest debacle has put his position under renewed pressure.

Seymour Pierce analyst Caroline de La Soujeole said: 'In terms of numbers, the Olympics won't make much difference to people's full-year forecasts. Financially, it's nothing significant.

'People are not worried about numbers but about impact on reputation, which is hard to quantify.

'Potentially, there's a danger it could lose further contracts. And there is the question is that the end for Nick Buckles?'

G4S's revenues hit £7.5 billion last year, while underlying profits grew 2% to £531 million and analysts said any shortfall from the Olympics contract would not hurt the company.

Ms de La Soujeole believes the company's growth prospects remain strong because it is set to benefit from the public sector's austerity drive as more authorities look to outsource work.

Last year, for example, G4S started running Birmingham prison, and a contract to run Oakwood prison in Wolverhampton started in April.

And G4S won a ground-breaking £200 million contract to design and run a station for Lincolnshire Police, including running cells, administering drug tests and managing the force's vehicle fleet.

A retired police officer who was turned down by Olympic company G4S was given an access all areas pass anyway in a ‘massive breach’ of security.

Ian Glendinning, a veteran of 32 years with Northumbria Police, was invited to collect his Olympic pass, despite being turned down for a job with the security  company.

The 55-year-old applied for a job with G4S in January and was told he had landed a role as a group leader during the games.

But his job offer was rescinded because he was unable to attend training dates, and just hours later he was sent an e-mail inviting him to collect his security pass in Newcastle.

Mr Glendinning claims that the pass, bearing the G4S logo, gives him access to secure sites across the Olympic Park but said it could easily have been obtained by falsifying documents.

Last night he branded it as a ‘spectacular failure’ on the part of the organising chiefs despite the fact checks that had been made on a five-year history he provided them with.

Mr Glendinning, who works as an assistant manager at the Clennell Hall Hotel in Alwinton, Northumberland, said: 'Last Friday they emailed me saying I had been scheduled on training courses, but it would be in London.

'I was told I would be group leader supervisor, supervising the entrances, exits and pedestrian search areas.

'But when I couldn’t go to that training, they said I wouldn’t be able to do the job.

'It was unspeakable stupidity, but then I got an email asking me to go and collect my accreditation.'

Mr Glendinning said he was disappointed by the levels of security at the games.

He said: 'I’ve got a background in anti-terrorism, I was in the special unit for 20 years dealing with firearms and intelligence gathering.

'I got my licence from the Security Industry Authority, in 2006 after I retired from Northumbria Police.

'I must be one of the most experienced applicants that they have but because the system is so unfit for purpose I now won’t be there.

'They are not fulfilling the role that they are supposed to.

'The Olympics are going to be staffed by young inexperienced people who have no background in security.'
