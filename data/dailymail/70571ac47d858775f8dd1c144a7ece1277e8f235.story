A sales consultant is suing real estate firm Zillow for sexual harassment after she was allegedly ranked on breast size and sent pictures of colleagues' penises.

Rachel Kremer claims she was sent graphic emails and pictures, objectified by her superiors and asked to perform sexual acts repeatedly for six months.

Filing a federal suit, she described the revered company's Irvine, California, branch as an 'adult frat house'.

Allegations: Rachel Kremer says she felt objectified by texts sent from her colleague Gabe Schmidt at Zillow

Ms Kremer claims she endured 'sexual torture' and said she is speaking out for other 'silenced' women

Ms Kremer, who worked at Zillow between June 2012 and August 2014, said she and other female empoyees endured 'sexual torture'.

The firm has hit back, citing vulgar texts between Ms Kremer and her colleague Gabe Schmidt to show she was complicit in the exchanges.

Her attorney, CNN legal analyst Ben Meiselas, insists this is evidence of 'brainwashing'.

'As to the substance of their motion, what has become clear is that employees were encouraged by management to use foul language in order to maintain a paycheck at Zillow,' Meiselas told GeekWire.

'Being brainwashed by this corporate culture does not invite actual unwanted sexual advances and physical touching.'

According to Ms Kremer, her action speaks for others who have been 'silenced'.

The suit states: 'Ms Kremer's male supervisors ranked her according to her breast size, sent pictures of their penis to her, and demanded sexual gratification and obedience by Ms Kremer to continue her employment.'

Two colleagues, including Mr Schmidt, have been fired over the incident, GeekWire reported. 

Zillow was named in the list of America's top 50 companies to work for this week.

An employee satisfaction survey collated by Glassdoor.com pegged the firm at 33, a notch above Ford Motor Company and two below NBC Universal.

However, the sexual harassment claim comes days after another suit accuses the Irvine branch of penalizing an employee who reported unlawful behavior in his department.

James Friedrich was allegedly deprived of multiple promotions after he reported that a co-worker fraudulently boosted their sales figures.

The suit claims Mr Friedrich was told to 'drop it' and 'stop hanging out' with two of his friends when he brought the claim to his superiors.
