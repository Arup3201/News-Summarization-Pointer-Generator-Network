In his own words: Mr McDermid's blog post describing his 'final meal'

Mr McDermid described his meal at the Hawksmoor in Spitalfields, located a mile from the French restaurant where he fell to his death, in his blog.

'There seems to be a fascination on "final meals" with many people online…mine was at Hawksmoor Spitalfields (400g Ribeye with a Donnington Cesear Salad, triple poked chips with lime pickle mayo side with a Coulston bassett stilton with pears and walnuts),' he wrote.

He also posted a quote by Samuel Johnson on blog, which is followed by more than 7,000 people. 

'When a man is tired of London, he is tired of life; for there is in London all that life can afford,' it read.

'From my observations and research it appears that you need two of the three criteria for success with very few exceptions. What does this mean it means that it’s “game over” for me.' 

Tributes to the food writer have flooded social media since news of his death emerged this morning.

TV chef Gizzie Erskine wrote on Twitter 'Can't find the words RIP @wilkes888,' and included a broken heart symbol in the post. 

Food writer Uyen Luu, the author of My Vietnamese Kitchen, added: 'So very sad to learn about the death of Wilkes McDermid, I saw him many times around, but didn't get to know him & sad I didn't try harder.'

Chef Jean-Paul De Ronne tweeted: 'Rest in Peace Wilkes. Was a pleasure reading your musings. Sad the last ones were goodbye.'

A member of staff at Hawksmoor took to Twitter, posting from the restaurant's account: 'Horrific to hear about Wilkes. I hope anyone reading the story with similar thoughts realises nothing is hopeless and help is at hand.' 

Mr McDermid, who lived in Chelsea, west London, sparked fears among friends and relatives two years ago after failing to board a flight back to the UK from South Africa. 

Social media was flooded with tributes, with best-selling food author Sabrina Ghayour sharing her thoughts. A post from the Hawksmoor account, where Mr McDermid ate in the hours before his death, was also shared

Following the death of a man in 2013, the restaurant placed barriers around its roof terrace (pictured above) 

The restaurant at Number 1 Poultry is popular with City workers. It was once owned by Sir Terence Conran

City of London Police said in a statement that they are investigating the death at around 6pm Sunday but are not treating it as suspicious. 

'Next of kin have been informed,' the police said in a statement.

Mr Wilkes is the third person in three years to have died after falling from the terrace at Coq D'Argent, a French restaurant once owned by Sir Terence Conran. 

In 2012, banker Nico Lambrechts fell to his death shortly after starting a new job.  

Following his death, staff at the restaurant once owned by Sir Terence Conran, insisted more measures would be taken to prevent suicide attempts. 

The year before, a woman plunged to her death after drinking a glass of wine at the restaurant. 

Rema Begum, 29, had been suffering depression after losing her job. 

In 2010, Deutsche Bank broker Anjool Malde died in the same way. The Oxford graduate was clutching a glass of champagne when he fell to his death. 

In 2007, a man was reported as having fallen from the restaurant's roof and landing on a bus. 

The restaurant has not commented publicly since news of Mr McDermid's death.
