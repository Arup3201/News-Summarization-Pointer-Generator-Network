It’s hard to imagine that these little fellows would ever grow up to be one of the jungle’s apex predators - that their gorgeous green eyes would be used to lock onto their prey ahead of a merciless kill.

Despite their fearsome future little Remaong and Ferra are now the twin attractions at the Tierpark Zoo, Berlin and were introduced to the public today.

The cuddly looking panther twins, with their clumsy big paws and ludicrously long whiskers, were born in late April.

You looking at me: One of the pair emerges from its basket while being presented to the media with its sibling at Tierpark Berlin Zoo

Time to play: Remaong and Ferra tentatively emerge from their basket

Feeling shy: Their permanent canine teeth do not come in until the age of one - and by the age of two panthers in the wild are usually independent of their mothers

Both pups are developing under the care of their mother Angie, 14, and seven-year-old father Bromo.

It’s unusual that a male big cat would take so much interest in his offspring – but Bromo has shown that he is responsible beyond his years and has turned into a real family man.

Like all good fathers he was even present at the birth on April 26.

Black panther cubs are born with their eyes closed, not opening them until about ten days after the birth.

They do not gain enough mobility to move around until two or three weeks after the birth - and do not start to eat meat until they are nearly three months old.

Good life ahead: In the wild black panthers usually live for up to twelve years - but born in captivity, Remaong and Ferra may grow to be 20 years old

The term 'black panther' can be confusing, with scientists agreeing it does not refer to a specific sub-species of big cat.

Most generally, the term refers to any type of big cat with a black coat
- though the only scientifically recognised definitions are a black 
leopard and a black jaguar.
