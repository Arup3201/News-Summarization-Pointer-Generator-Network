Michelle Obama focused on energizing the student vote in one of the most crucial states in her husband’s bid for a second term as president.

The First Lady held a rally at the University of Florida in Gainesville on Monday before heading north to Florida State University, where thousands of tickets were given away for the event.

Before the Gainesville event, Mrs Obama stopped at Girls Place Inc, which provides programs for economically disadvantaged girls.

Dressed in a blue, geometric-patterned dress and matching blue pumps, she sang and danced with about 40 elementary school-aged girls and met separately with two other groups.

The First Lady has been a frequent visitor to Florida, which, with 29 electoral votes, is the largest swing state and the most sought after prize in the presidential election.

Michelle focused on the college vote, telling thousands of poster-waving students at the Florida State campus in Tallahassee: 'All of the progress we've made, it is on the line.

'As my husband has said, this election's going to be even closer than the last one. And it could all come down to what happens in a few key battleground states. Yes - like Florida.'

Referencing the George W. Bush era, Mrs 
Obama added: 'And folks here in Florida, you all know a little something
about close elections, don't you?'

She implored students to take advantage of early voting in order to volunteer on election day.

According to a poll by NBC last week, Obama has a five-point lead on Republican nominee Mitt Romney among likely voters in Florida.

On her whirlwind visit to Florida, 
the First Lady made no reference to a secret recording made of her 
husband's Republican rival in which he can be heard telling a political 
fundraiser that 47 per cent of Americans are dependent on government and
that 'my job is not to worry about those people'.

Student appeal: Mrs Obama does the 'gator chomp' hand gesture that students at the University of Florida make during sports games on campus

The video of Romney at a $50,000-a-plate fundraiser in Boca Raton, Florida in May was posted on YouTube by left-wing magazine Mother Jones.

Without referring to the controversy, Mrs Obama instead chose to highlight her and Barack's values.

She told the student crowd of around 8,000: 'As president you need a strong inner
compass, a core commitment to your fellow citizen, that’s how you make 
the right decisions for this country. That’s what it takes to be a 
leader.'
