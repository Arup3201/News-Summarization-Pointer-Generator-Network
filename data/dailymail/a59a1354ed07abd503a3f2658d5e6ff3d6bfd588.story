British diplomats are being forced to serve drinks in plastic glasses and use cheap wine following a string of government cut-backs, it has been revealed.

They are also having to swap their previously lavish private residences for restaurants and commercial outlets in a bid to meet a new entertainment budget.

The 'low cost' functions are a far cry from Ferrero Rocher's infamous advert, which portrays ambassador's parties as extravagant, luxurious and 'exquisite' affairs.

The classic 'Ambassador's Party' advert - which became cult viewing in the 1990s - features an ambassador with 'exquisite taste' entertaining guests with a pyramid of gold-wrapped chocolates.

It then sees a beautiful woman taking a chocolate, before declaring in a foreign accent ' Monsieur, with these Rocher you are really spoiling us'.

British diplomats' more modest functions were highlighted yesterday in a report by the House of Commons foreign affairs committee, according to The Telegraph.

The report warns that government cuts to
 the entertainment budget are affecting morale - with staff also facing a
 larger workload following the five-year £170million savings ordered by a
 spending review in 2010.

Although the document does not specify details of the cuts, several regulars on 
the diplomatic scene have spoken of their experiences of 'low cost' 
functions

One guest at a
 high commission party in South Africa told the newspaper: 'We were told
 it was a black–tie do, but it turned out to be in a breezeblock 
building that was the staff bar.

'I
 arrived late and was given the last glass of cheap plonk, only for a 
lackey to then appear and ask to swap my glass with a plastic one 
because the real ones had been hired and needed to go back.'

Meanwhile,
 other guests have recalled seeing advertisements for budget airline 
easyJet at functions, and being forced to consume 'just about drinkable'
 wine.

Dispute: Foreign Secretary William Hague (left) is continuing to push for the promotion and support of British business abroad, but Sir Richard Ottaway (right) has warned the Foreign Office is 'being worked to the limit'

The report comes as Foreign Secretary William Hague continues to push for the promotion and support of British business overseas.

Yesterday, Sir Richard Ottaway, Tory MP and 
chairman of the committee, said that the Foreign Office was 'being worked to 
the limit'.

'We have no problem with an 
active and ambitious foreign policy, but we're getting a 
distinct impression that the FCO may be trying to do too much, when 
capacity is limited by a tough spending review settlement,' he said.

The cuts have also forced embassies to hire local, cheaper employees - with more junior staff being given the task of entertaining dignitaries.

This has led to difficulties when hiring venues for functions, as only ambassadors are permitted to rent properties large enough for official entertaining, the report said.

It added that the hosting of functions at public premises is now considered to be 'the norm'. 

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'The Foreign Affairs Committee’s annual inquiry into the FCO highlights the excellent work the FCO is doing in many areas despite government-wide spending constraints.

'While we continue to face budget pressures we are committed to meeting our planned headcount reduction of 10 per cent by the end of 2015-2016.

'We are mindful of the committee’s concerns and the need to ensure that we continue to meet ambitious targets without overstretching ourselves.

'We will look at the findings of the report in detail and publish our formal response in due course.'
