Amir Khan will give Floyd Mayweather a matter of days, rather than a year, to decide whether his next fight will be against the rejuvenated star of British boxing.

Khan is not holding his breath.

Nor does he expect Sheffield’s Kell Brook to go through with the world title fight which could lead to one of those battles of Britain the home fans love.

All of 
which complicates Khan’s future planning following his brilliant victory
 over the experienced Luis Collazo in Las Vegas on Saturday night.

Mayweather, who dug deep to protect his unbeaten record against Marcos Maidana in a thriller atop the same bill in the MGM Grand Garden Arena, is being asked if he will reschedule his next fight from September to November to give Khan adequate training time after he fasts during Ramadan.

The reluctance of Mayweather to answer that question makes Khan suspect that the world’s No 1 fighter is wary of the speed which bedazzled Collazo. 

Mayweather is much happier discussing a re-match with Maidana, even though talks with team Khan began in Vegas.

But Khan, having wasted a year in in the dashed expectation of fighting Mayweather this weekend, is not prepared to wait again. He says: ‘Now I’m back in business I need another meaningful fight in the autumn. I want to get it sorted in principle in the next couple of weeks.

‘I think people have been warning Floyd about my speed. He is a great boxer but as he gets older and slows down a little I think he knows I can give him problems, being as quick as I am.’

As for Brook, who has been calling him out, Khan has always said that the man from Sheffield needs to prove himself at elite level, preferably by winning a world title.

Brook has been nominated by the IBF as the mandatory challenger to their welterweight champion Shawn Porter but Khan says: ‘I don’t believe Kell will take that fight.  Not only is Porter tough and dangerous but Brook has a lot of confidence issues.  

‘A source close to his camp tells me that Kell keeps asking if this is the right time for him, if he’s ready for such a difficult fight. It’s like he’s already lost that fight in his head.’

Other November alternatives for Khan would be a re-match of his own against one of the two rivals who knocked his career off track for a while, Lamont Peterson or Danny Garcia. He says: ‘I would love the chance to put the record straight with both of them.’

But his preoccupation is with Mayweather, even if they both have to come through additional fights later this year before meeting next May:  ‘I will feel unfulfilled if the fight doesn’t happen. You always want to take on the best.

‘Not only that but I think they can give the people what they want, namely Floyd’s first defeat. It feels that the public have grown tired of him, even the Americans. When I talk to taxi drivers here or people come up to me at dinner, it seems they hate him now.’

Mayweather who is planning a trip to England next month - apparently part business, part pleasure –  and has told Khan he would like to meet  up with him. But Khan says: ‘I don’t think he’ll be coming to Bolton. I guess I would have to go down to London.’

The improvements Khan has made during eight months working with new trainer Virgil Hunter may not be helping his pursuit of Mayweather. Not only has he tightened the defence of his chin but he has learned to meet like with like if an opponent fights dirty.

As Collazo realised he was being out-classed he threw deliberate low blows, among other infractions of the rules. Khan says: ‘I had to get into the holding and elbowing as well. The days of only trading clean shots are long gone in boxing. You have to get down and dirty if necessary.’

The mighty Mayweather revealed the same philosophy as he dealt with Maidana’s relentless attempts to rough him up and Khan adds: ‘Floyd is very clever at holding and the use of his elbow, forearm and the inside of the glove. That’s another reason why fighting him would be very difficult – like a physical chess match between us – but I really do think I am the one who can prevent him going through his career undefeated.’

After his performance against Collazo there will be less scoffing at Khan’s self-confidence, whoever he fights next.

Tough night: Marcos Maidana gave Mayweather a fight before losing by majority decision at the MGM Grand

Rough and tumble: Maidana did not give Mayweather a minute's peace over their 12-round battle

Oscar De La Hoya’s dramatic re-emergence from drink and drugs rehab is raising hope that he can put an end to the cold war between rival promoters which is preventing so many potentially great fights taking place.

One of his first actions has been to call a truce with Bob Arum after years of bitterness between their respective corporations.

This has caused a schism within Golden Boy, whose chief executive Richard Schaefer has vowed never to return to doing business with Arum, whose Top Rank company boast Manny Pacquiao as their flagship fighter.

Schaefer is considering his future and may move to Mayweather Promotions, for whom Golden Boy are operating partners.

De La Hoya and former banker Schaefer have built Golden Boy into boxing’s biggest promoters and as the former Olympic and world champion returned to the public spotlight hours before Floyd Mayweather’s fight with Marcos Maidana in Las Vegas, he said: ‘No-one is dismissing Richard and I want him to continue making great fights like this one, which is his job.

‘But I have a vision of where this company can grow and no-one will stop me realising it.  If we can work with Arum it will be good for boxing, so why not?’

Schaefer cites problems in the past and there is talk of a power struggle but De La Hoya says: ‘I want to offer an olive branch to Richard. I want him to stay. But I have to look after myself, my family and the good of boxing, this sport I love.

‘Our company is not called Golden Boy for nothing. I am the president and the major shareholder.’

His peace-making with Arum will have the support of boxing fans the world over, even if a long-awaited super-fight between Mayweather and Pacquiao is not a consequence.

Mayweather is in effect his own promoter and he continues to refuse to work with Arum.

But there are a lot of other exciting match-ups to be made between the rival stables of boxers.

Manny Pacquiao v Amir Khan, for starters.

The football-like crush as a crowd of some 16,000 charged their way out of the MGM Grand Garden on Saturday night had been an accident waiting to happen.

More than 20 people, several of them children, were hurt and taken to hospital after panic set in. 

By luck, none of the injuries were serious but the incident highlights exit problems at this arena. 

There has been a lot of pushing and surging after several fights here, as the spectators funnel out of multiple doors into a comparatively narrow indoor walk-way to the casino. There was also a warning the afternoon before when hundreds of fans hoping to see the weigh-in arrived after the arena was full and were caught up in that bottle-neck.

False reports of a gun-shot – after a bollard crashed to the floor   - aggravated the situation on fight night.

The organisers could do worse than consult English authorities who have become expert at controlling football crowds.
