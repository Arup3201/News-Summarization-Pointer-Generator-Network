Team news

Swansea

Jonjo Shelvey is set to return for Swansea's Barclays Premier League home game with Leicester on Saturday evening.

Shelvey served a one-match ban last weekend for picking up five bookings and England Under-21 international Tom Carroll deputised for him in the controversial 2-1 defeat at Stoke.

Leon Britton (knee), Jordi Amat (knee), Dwight Tiendalli (groin) and Jazz Richards (knee) are still missing as Swansea seek to end a run of five league games without a win.

Provisional squad: Fabianski, Rangel, Fernandez, Williams, Taylor, Ki, Shelvey, Dyer, Routledge, Sigurdsson, Bony, Tremmel, Bartley, Carroll, Montero, Emnes, Gomis, Shephard, Fulton.

Leicester

Riyad Mahrez could return for Leicester at Swansea after he was left out of the Foxes' 1-0 defeat at Newcastle United.

Boss Nigel Pearson did not want to risk the winger after he only returned from international duty with Algeria 24 hours before the clash with the Magpies.

Pearson has virtually a full strength side to pick from with only Matt Upson (ankle) and cruciate knee ligament injury victim Zoumana Bakayogo - who was not named in the Foxes' Barclays Premier League squad - out.

Provisional squad: Schmeichel, Hamer, Morgan, Moore, De Laet, Konchesky, Wasilewski, Drinkwater, Hammond, James, King, Cambiasso, Albrighton, Mahrez, Knockaert, Vardy, Ulloa, Nugent, Schlupp, Wood.
