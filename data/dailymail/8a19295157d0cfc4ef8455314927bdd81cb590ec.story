Lisa Grantham and her family have all been banned from a Tesco Express in Coventry because one of the children was eating a 10p Maoam fruit bar

A family of four has been banned from a branch of Tesco because a five-year-old girl started eating a 10p sweet inside the store.

Distraught Lisa Grantham, 26, claimed she and her three children were kicked out of their local shop when her daughter Dulcie tucked in to a sweet that her mother had already paid for

The full-time mum said they were left in tears as a burly security guard banned the entire family from the Tesco Express.

Lisa said she was left feeling ‘embarrassed and humiliated’ after being ejected from the busy Coventry store in front of other shoppers.

She said she had grabbed the ‘Maoam’ chew bar from one of the bags she was still carrying from a previous Tesco shopping trip earlier in the day.

She gave the snack to Dulcie as an after-school treat which she ate while her mum paid for the second round of shopping.

It was then, Lisa claims, that the security guard approached them - and brusquely demanded they leave the store.

She said: 'I was chatting with the lady at the counter and we were laughing - there wasn’t a problem.

'The children were behaving themselves, then the security man came over.

'He said `the kids shouldn’t be eating in here’. I said that he knew I had bought that sweet earlier and he agreed.

'Then I said `Are you trying to say I 
didn’t buy them?’ 'He then shouted across the store: "That’s it, you’re 
barred - you and the kids!"'

'It came out of the blue and I felt so humiliated because the shop was busy. I was never made to feel so bad in my life.

'I’ve seen lots of children eating in there before. We’ve done nothing wrong.'

Lisa said that she and Dulcie and her other two children Sophie, eight, and Jason, three, left the store in tears.

After composing herself she returned to speak to the store manager minutes later.

She added: 'I just couldn’t let him get 
away with talking to his customers like that. I think he was new and he 
just stood there and didn’t say anything when I told him.

The security guard backtracked and 
said he hadn’t barred us because of the sweet but because of the way the
wrapper had been put in the pram - he just changed his story 
completely.

'I was absolutely gobsmacked. I’d never heard anything like it.

I just said you’ve just lost one of your most loyal customers and went without looking back.'

Lisa is in the process of lodging a formal complaint with Tesco and is demanding an apology.

Tesco admits banning the family but say it was because the security guard believed the chew bar had not been paid for.

A
Tesco spokesman said: 'We understand that it can be difficult to keep an eye on small children while shopping but staff in the store have spoken to the customer before about incidents like this.

'We would of course be happy to reconsider the ban if we are given a reassurance that it won't happen again.'
