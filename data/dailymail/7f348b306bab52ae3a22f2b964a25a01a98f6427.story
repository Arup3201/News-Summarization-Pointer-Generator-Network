Daley Blind's agent says Manchester United are yet to launch a bid to sign his client.

Blind is understood to be on Louis van Gaal's transfer shortlist, but the Manchester United manager has not made a move for the Ajax utility man, according to his representative Rob Jansen.

'At this moment Manchester United have not been in touch with me or Ajax about Daley and I'm not sitting here waiting for the call,' Jansen told talkSPORT.

Van Gaal knows Blind well from his time in charge of the Dutch national side.

The 24-year-old son of former Holland international Danny Blind, can operate at left-back or in central midfield, where United are in desperate need of reinforcements.

United expect to complete the record £59.7million transfer of Angel di Maria from Real Madrid on Tuesday, and more signings are expected thereafter.

United could make a move for Arturo Vidal, although the club have reservations about the state of the Juventus midfielder's right knee, which was operated on in May.

Central defence is another area where Van Gaal needs to strengthen before the transfer window closes, even though he bolstered his back line with the £16million acquisition of Marcos Rojo from Sporting Lisbon last week.
