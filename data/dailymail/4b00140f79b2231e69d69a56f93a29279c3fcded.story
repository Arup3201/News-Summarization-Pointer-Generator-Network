Indiana Pacers star Paul George has drawn fury from his team after he appeared to defend ex-NFL player Ray Rice in the beating of his wife — and said Rice should be allowed to play again.

The Pacers forward on Thursday took to Twitter to opine on the Rice controversy, in which a shocking video shows the former Baltimore Ravens running back knocking his now-wife Janay unconscious in a hotel elevator.

'If you in a relationship and a woman hit you first and attacking YOU…Then you obviously ain’t beating HER,' George wrote to his nearly 900,000 followers. 'Homie made A bad choice!'

He added, 'I
 don't condone hittin women or think it's coo BUT if SHE ain't trippin 
then I ain't trippin.. Lets keep it movin lol let that man play!' he 
wrote.

Pacers boss
 Larry Bird fumed that George's comments were 'thoughtless and without 
regard to the subject of domestic violence and its seriousness in 
society.'

'We
 have talked to Paul to strongly express our displeasure and made it 
clear that the NBA and the Pacers organization will not condone or 
tolerate remarks of this nature,' Bird said in a statement.

'Paul understands that he was wrong and why his tweets were so inappropriate and is very apologetic."

In the same statement, George apologized for his 'insensitive tweets.'

'They
 were obviously without proper understanding of the seriousness of the 
situation and I sincerely regret my poor choice of words,' said George, who's missing the upcoming NBA season after breaking his right leg playing for Team USA.

Shockingly, George is not alone among those who support Rice's actions — and think his indefinite suspension from the NFL is too great a punishment.

A number of Ravens fans say they still support Rice, many of them women.

'There's
 two sides to every story,' said Bailey, a 23-year-old waitress from 
Baltimore who was wearing a black, rhinestone-decorated jersey with the 
white No. 27.

domestic violence, but to her, |Rice's attack 'wasn't that 
big of a deal'

Some fans say Rice's punishment was too harsh

'I
 saw the video. That's their personal business, and it shouldn't have 
affected his career. I don't agree with domestic violence, but she's 
still with him, so obviously it wasn't that big of a deal. Everyone 
should just drop it.'

The
 team, meanwhile, has started a Ray Rice Jersey Exchange policy, 
allowing fans to trade in their Rice jersey for another player on the 
Ravens.

They will also no longer be selling ray Rice jerseys.
