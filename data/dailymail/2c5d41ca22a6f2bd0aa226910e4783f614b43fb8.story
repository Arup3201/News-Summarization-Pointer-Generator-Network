A fake Good Samaritan stole clothes and a camera from an elderly couple's holiday luggage before helping them onto a train with the bag he had just ransacked.

The young thief was caught on camera rifling through the 73-year-old's bag and trying on his clothes as he waited to catch a train from Troedyrhiw station near Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales.

But when the couple's train arrived, the brazen thief offered to 'help' them by carrying the bag and their walking stick onto the carriage.

The fake Good Samaritan is believed to have got off the train at Troedyrhiw station near Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, where he stole from the elderly couple's bag

The thief, pictured above, ransacked the holiday luggage and even tried on the pensioner's clothes 

The 73-year-old grandfather had left his bag in the shelter while he went to meet his wife at the front of the station 

The couple even thanked the thief for his help, before realising what he had done.

He then fled the scene, taking a new camera, a jacket and a bag containing the couple's medication. 

PC Steve Lawrence, who has today released photos of the CCTV footage, said: 'This was an extremely upsetting experience for the couple and one of the worst possible starts to their holiday.

'At a time when they should have been eagerly looking forward to their break, they were instead made to feel vulnerable as a result of this callous theft.

'The most galling aspect of this incident is the fact that just moments after ransacking their bags, the brazen thief had the nerve to help the couple onto the train with their luggage and walking stick.'

The grandfather had left his bag unattended in a train shelter while he went to meet his wife at the front of the station.

The thief helped the couple onto the train with the bag he had just looted before fleeing from the scene 

The thief is thought to have got off the train, spotted the bag and started rifling through the contents. 

PC Lawrence said: 'Enquiries have been ongoing to identify the person responsible for this theft but to no avail.

'However, today, I am in a position to release an image of a man we believe will have key information about this incident.

The couple even thanked the fake Good Samaritan for his help before realising what he had done 

'I would urge anyone who recognises the individual pictured, or knows their whereabouts, to please get in touch.'

The thief is described as white and believed to be around 20 years old. He is approximately 5ft 10in to 6ft tall, of thin build and with collar-length dark hair.

He was wearing black clothing and a black baseball hat with a white motif on the front and a white cross on top.

Police say he is a smoker who rolls his own cigarettes. He also has a tattoo on his left forearm made up of 'five separate letters or symbols'.
