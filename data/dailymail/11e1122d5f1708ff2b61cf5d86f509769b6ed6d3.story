Diego Simeone is playing no part in Brazil 2014 but is the hottest manager in football and the leading candidate to take over either Spain, if Vicente del Bosque stands down, or Argentina, should Alejandro Sabella fail to survive this weekend’s World Cup quarter final against Belgium.       

Simeone has moved to the top of the game’s wanted list after inspiring a comparatively low-budget Atletico Madrid to beat Real and Barcelona to La Liga title and reach the Champions League Final.

The 44-year-old Argentinian has long 
harboured the ambition of managing his own country, while sources close 
to him in Buenos Aires are leaking word of provisional enquiries from 
Spain.

National pride: He could be brought in to coach Lionel Messi and Argentina, with Alejandro Sabella's future in doubt

New man? Spain have made tentative enquiries about him succeeding Vicente Del Bosque

Simeone is understood
 to have an escape clause in his contract with Atletico and to be 
monitoring the fallout of coaches from the World Cup.

Although
 defending champions Spain were astonishingly eliminated after only two 
matches in Brazil – as were England, albeit less surprisingly -  del 
Bosque, like Roy Hodgson, has been given the continued backing of his 
national association.

However,
 the 63-year-old Del Bosque is being allowed time to discuss with his 
family whether to stay in charge for the remaining two years of his 
contract. A definitive statement from him was expected this week but 
none has been forthcoming.

If
 there are any doubts Spain will need his successor in charge for their 
2016 defence of the European Championship, also won by Del Bosque, and 
to begin the rebuilding process for Russia 2018.

With
 Pep Guardiola making it clear the has no desire to swap the daily 
involvement of club management – be it with Bayern Munich, Barcelona or 
anywhere else – for the international game, Simeone has come into 
intensifying focus as potentially Spain’s first foreign head coach for 
more than half a century (Jorge Santamairia, former Real Madrid giant 
who took charge in the 80s, held dual nationality and played for Spain).

Also, of course, Spanish is Simeone’s native language.

Meanwhile,
 Sabella’s position with Argentina has already been compromised by a 
much-publicised dressing-room revolt, apparently led by Lionel Messi, 
which has wrought a change of tactics en route to the clash with 
Belgium’s galaxy of Premier League stars.

It
 is thought that only the winning of the World Cup – ideally for him 
against arch-rivals Brazil in the Final in the Maracana on Sunday week –
 could save Sabella’s job. And even then his survival would not be 
guaranteed.

Gone: But star striker Diego Costa is joining Chelsea for £32m this summer

Simeone amassed 
106 caps for Argentina, admitting that he was embarrassed at being the 
first to surpass the tally of the great Diego Maradona. He described 
himself as ‘the midfield player with a knife between my teeth.’

He
 played in three World Cups, and during France 98 David 
Beckham was infamously sent off for donkey-kicking him in retaliation 
for a heavy foul.

Simeone 
confessed later that he exaggerated his reaction to that incident. He 
is a notoriously fiery character and faces a touchline ban by UEFA for 
going into meltdown when Atletico conceded a late equaliser to Real Madrid in 
the Champions League final, going on to lose in extra time.

He
 is nicknamed Colo, historically a Latin American insult for those of 
mixed peasant stock but now a chav-like word for his style of dress.

Following
 his retirement at the end of a varied playing career in Argentina and 
Italy, coaching successes at home led to Simeone’s appointmen by 
Atletico three years ago.

He
 is being advised to cash in now on his successs in Madrid which will 
be near-impossible for him to sustain against the wealth of Real and 
Barca in Spain, or in Europe in competition with the financial giants of
 the Premier League and PSG in France.

Atletico’s
 sale of Diego Costa to Chelsea has given rise to reports in Paris of 
Jose Mourinho facing the sack and Simeone following his 
goalscorer-in-chief to Stamford Bridge.

While that speculation appears highly fanciful, Spain and Argentina are keeping the Simeone option open.
