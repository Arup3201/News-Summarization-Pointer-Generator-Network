A masterpiece by English artist Joseph Turner that has been in private hands for 136 years is to be sold at auction for an estimated £20million.

The large-scale oil painting, titled 'Rome, from Mount Aventine', which captures a raised view of the Italian capital, was produced by the great landscape artist in 1835.

The work is said to be 'beyond praise' and highlights Turner's 'genius'.

'Rome, from Mount Aventine' - the painting by Joseph Turner which is set to fetch £20million at auction at Sotheby's when it is sold for the first time in 136 years

It was sold for the first and only time for £6,000  in 1878, when it was acquired by the 5th Earl of Rosebery, Archibald Primrose, who later became Prime Minister.

The immaculately-preserved picture has remained in the Rosebery collection ever since.

It has been loaned out to various museums over the last 40 years - most recently the National Gallery of Scotland - and a spokesman for the Rosebery family explained they are selling it now to fund the maintenance of their estates.

Alex Bell, joint international head and co-chairman of old master paintings at auctioneers Sotheby's, said: 'There are fewer than 10 major Turners in private hands known today and this work must rank as one of the very finest.

'This painting, which is nearly 200 years old, looks today as if it has come straight from the easel of the artist; never relined and never subject to restoration, the picture retains the freshness of the moment it was painted.

'The hairs from Turner's brush, the drips of liquid paint which have run down the edge of the canvas, and every scrape of his palette knife have been preserved in incredible detail.

'"Rome, from Mount Aventine" comes to sale at the same time as the ground-breaking exhibition of "Late Turner" at the Tate, which will further enhance our understanding of the artist's genius.

'Its emergence on the market represents a rare and exciting opportunity for collectors.'

The painting used to hang alongside its sister painting, 'Modern Rome - Campo Vaccino', in the Roseberys' homes - in London and then in Buckinghamshire.

That picture was sold in 2010 - for a record fee for a Turner of almost £30million - also at Sotheby's. 

'Rome, from Mount Aventine' was commissioned by Turner’s patron Hugh Munro of Novar in 1828, and took seven years and many visits to Rome to complete. 

He kept the painting in his home until his death, whereupon it was sold on to the Earl of Rosebery. 

The 36ins by 49ins oil painting, still in its original frame, is being sold by Sotheby's in London on December 3.

Joseph Mallord William Turner was born in Covent Garden, London in 1775, the son of William Turner, a barber and wig maker, and Mary Marshall, who came from a family of butchers.

He was a Romantic landscape painter, water-colourist and printmaker, but was most famous for his oil paintings. Although controversial in his time, he is known as 'the painter of light' and is now widely regarded as one of the greatest artists in British history.

His first known venture into art came when he was just 10 years old, after he had been sent to live with his uncle, Joseph Marshall, in Brentford. By the age of 11, his paintings were already being sold in his father's shop.

He was accepted into the Royal Academy of Art at 15, and his first watercolour - A View of the Archbishop's Palace, Lambeth - was shown at the summer exhibition in 1790, when he was the same age. 

He painted a lot of shipwrecks, fires and natural phenomena, as they were suited to his bold style and his ability to capture the essence and energy of nature. He put a  humans in his paintings to highlight their vulnerability when put next to nature's enormity.

What was perhaps most important in all of his painting though, was light, which to Turner represented God and his power. 

Turner's unique technique used watercolour style with oil paints and usually strong, albeit natural colours.

He painted a lot of traditionally English landscapes, but also travelled around Europe a lot, a drew subjects from there too.

Some of his most famous paintings include Fisherman at Sea, Crossing the Brook, and Rain, Steam and Speed - The Great British Railway.

The Turner prize, which is named after him, is presented to a British artist under the age of 50 every year. It is Britain's most prominent art prize and often has extremely controversial winners, such as Tracey Emin's 'My Bed'.

Meanwhile, a major new Turner exhibition is opening at Tate Britain on Wednesday.

The exhibition will feature his flourishing and experimental later years - when critics were suggesting that the painter was losing his mind.

Late Turner: Painting Set Free showcases work from the final 15 years of Turner's life, from the age of 60 until a year before his death in 1851.

Light and Colour (Goethe's Theory) - the Morning after the Deluge - Moses Writing the Book of Genesis, 1842 (left) and Rain, Steam, and Speed - The Great Western Railway, 1844 (right)

It brings together 180 works from the UK and abroad, as well objects such as palettes and even the spectacles which once belonged to the London-born barber's son.

Many of the paintings show Turner developing a new understanding of light and colour, but at the same time the artist was being mocked and derided.

There are oils, such as 'The Departure Of The Fleet', among the last painting he exhibited before he died aged 76.

And watercolours including 'Bamborough Castle', which is on loan from a private collection and sold for almost £3million at auction in 2007.

The exhibition features maritime scenes, themes from classical history, and Turner engaging with the new technology of the age, steam power.

Co-curator Sam Smiles said: 'Turner created the most startling pieces during this period but for whatever reason, a major exhibition on Turner's later years has not been done before. It's a missing exhibition.

'But it's a timely exhibition. With an ageing population, and attitudes to age altered, this exhibition speaks to our questions about later life, creatively who are we, what do we do and how do we cope with ageing?

'Turner was continuously innovating, staying sharp and experimental. He's a wonderfully good role model for somebody who is coping with older age and staying vital.

'He defies the peak and decline model which people associate with artists. In that, he's not unique. But he shows a spectacular engagement with contemporary society in a way that no other artist at the time was doing.

'At the time Turner had some loyal patrons and some relatively sympathetic critics but there was also vicious, venomous copy suggesting that he'd lost his mind and that he'd got worse as he got older, talking about his eccentricities.'

Visitors to Tate Britain can also see a colour wheel installation made in response to Turner's work by Danish-born artist Olafur Eliasson, who famously created the illusion of a glowing sun at Tate Modern.
