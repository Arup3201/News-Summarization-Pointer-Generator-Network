Mesut Ozil is fighting hard to get back firing on all cylinders for Arsenal.

The German playmaker posted a picture of his leg in a brace as he did sit-ups in the gym, alongside the message: 'no, this is neither a red carpet nor a magic carpet. it is just the place where I'm working for my comeback.'

It followed another snap with the star's knee strapped up.

Mesut Ozil posted a picture of him wearing a large air compression support wrapped around his leg which helps improve blood circulation. The support is used to stimulate the pumping action of exercise.

Ozil applied the support to his leg which is there to release the muscle pressure around his knee and it helps ease aches, pains and stiffness.

The Arsenal star has been missing in action for Arsene Wenger's side with a knee ligament injury since the 2-0 defeat at Chelsea at the start of the month.

And now it looks like the playmaker, who has drawn criticism for his performances since his record £42.5million move to the Emirates last summer, is hell-bent on a speedy recovery.

Arsene Wenger revealed the freak injury Mesut Ozil picked up against Chelsea was merely from passing the ball with the outside of his left foot.

Ozil discovered a 'partial rupture of the outer band of the left knee joint' which he suffered during Arsenal's clash with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.

Wenger said on the injury: '(Do) you know how Ozil did the injury? Passing the ball with the outside of his left foot. He must have done that a million times.

'Ozil was on his own. He told me he just wanted to give the ball like that (flicked with the outside of his foot) and heard a little crack.'

Ozil originally suffered the injury against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on October 5

Wenger added that the German's knee problem is just the latest in a long line of 'coincidental injuries' rather than down to any failing in the club's medical support.

He also allayed any suggestions he went against the advice of both the player and Arsenal's own medical staff by sending Ozil out for the second half at Stamford Bridge on October 5, as his side were chasing a two goal deficit.
