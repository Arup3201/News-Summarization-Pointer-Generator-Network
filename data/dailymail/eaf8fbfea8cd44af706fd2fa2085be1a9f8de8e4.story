It seems Enzo Zidane is following in his father's footsteps after scoring a crucial winner for Real Madrid C against local rivals Atletico.

Zidane's father Zinedine was no stranger to scoring vital goals during his 17-year playing career and Enzo has started his time as a professional in the same vein.

The 19-year-old found the back of the net with a neat finish inside the area to clinch a 3-2 victory for his father's former club.

Collecting the ball in the box, Zidane Jr expertly got the ball from out of his feet before scooping a curling ball past the keeper.

The goal comes after Zidane's eldest son made his debut for Real Madrid's B side during their 2-1 victory at home to Conquense last month.

With his father helping lead the team from the touchline, Enzo made a brief two-minute cameo for Real's second string.

The midfielder failed to score on that occasion but is expected to become more involved with first-team affairs at the Segunda B - or Spanish third division - side.
