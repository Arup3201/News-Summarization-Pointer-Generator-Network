A man with a unique sense of humour has added a twist to his Tinder account by including reviews from his ex-girlfriends.

Jake Chapman, 26, from Seattle in Washington, US, is hoping to attract potential partners with the quirky tactic.

His profile includes a wide range of write-ups from four-star reviews to requests from now married women asking him to go away.

The charmer came up with the idea after deciding he was taking the dating game too seriously. 

His most-recent ex, Faith, responded: 'Well this is a 1am text if ever I have seen one' before writing a glowing review.

Another, Danielle, said: 'We were young and dumb - you were an a**hole. Looks like you've changed and like your [sic] doing awesome now.'

Jake, a web engineer, revealed his new profile - and the attention he has received on social media - has made his Tinder profile blow up.

Single Jake, who follows Christian beliefs, hopes to make a connection with someone and form a long-term bond, rather than a hook-up.

He said: 'I wanted to put up an honest view of what my exes thought of me, with just a bit of confidence about it because it's Tinder.

'Since then I've had numerous people reach out to me through social media and show me responses they too were getting from ex-girlfriends.

'Most people use it as a hook-up game but I swipe for people I actually think I could connect with.

'What I'm looking for is someone who shares my beliefs, but isn't afraid of life and what possibilities could be had.

'Someone who's passionate about their own life, what they're doing and want to somehow benefit the lives of people around them.'
