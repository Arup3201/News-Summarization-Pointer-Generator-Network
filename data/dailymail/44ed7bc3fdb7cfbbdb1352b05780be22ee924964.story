Councils were last night accused by ministers of ‘bending the law’ with their use of CCTV and overzealous parking wardens to catch out motorists and ‘fill their coffers’.

Eric Pickles fired a broadside after a parking watchdog told MPs that councils are ignoring official guidance on enforcement.

It said that, counter to the guidance, town halls are using surveillance cameras – which automatically issue fines – as a matter of ‘routine’, and leave no room for discretion.

Zealous: Councils overuse CCTV cameras to enforce parking and road rules, a new report says

Mr Pickles, the Local Government Secretary, said it was ‘a constitutional affront that Englishmen and women are being fined in arbitrary and unfair ways’ to fill their cash shortfalls.

Councils are on track to make £635million profit from parking this year – with income from fines and penalties alone topping £340million.

The latest criticism came in evidence to the Commons’ Transport Select Committee from the Traffic Penalty Tribunal, set up by ministers to consider drivers’ appeals against parking fines.

It cited concern over routine use of CCTV cameras to issue millions of fines. Department for Transport guidance says CCTV should only be used when it is impractical to use traffic wardens.

When CCTV is used, drivers only find out they have been caught when a fixed penalty ticket drops through their letter box some time later, making it harder to challenge the fine.

The tribunal told MPs: ‘Adjudicators have found cases where camera enforcement appears to be used as a matter of routine where the strict requirements for use in the Guidance do not appear to be present.’ Adjudicators also said councils are also refusing to use discretion to waive fines when a car stops in a ‘no waiting’ area for safety reasons.

In one such case, a driver was penalised for stopping after his windscreen shattered. Tickets have also been issued to motorists who have stopped  to change drivers after feeling unwell, the watchdog said. It added: ‘Modern-day occurrences call for sensible and considerate handling of representations.’ A ‘zero-tolerance’ policy, it added, ‘cannot be appropriate’.

Local Government minister Eric Pickles seized on the evidence, saying it shows ‘councils bending the law as a means of filling their coffers with taxpayers’ cash’. He added: ‘Parking charges and fines are not a tax, but even the independent Traffic Tribunal now warns they are being systematically abused by town hall officers.’

More than 300 councils in England have the power to keep income raised from fines and charges. But the law says they can only do so to ease congestion and control traffic – not to subsidise other services.

The High Court ruled last month that Barnet council acted ‘unlawfully’ when raising residents’ parking charges to boost its income.
