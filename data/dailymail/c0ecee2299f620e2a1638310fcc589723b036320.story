Jose Mourinho is keeping an eye on Raphael Varane's contract situation at Real Madrid ahead of showdown talks with Bernabeu bosses over a new deal.

Chelsea boss Mourinho is still in the market for a defender and a striker, despite an already busy summer transfer window, and rates Varane as Europe's finest young defender.

The 21-year-old's representatives will meet senior staff in Madrid next week as the French centre back looks to at least treble his £25,000-per-week wages to a figure more in line with other members of Real's squad.

Varane has three years left on the deal he signed upon joining the European champions, under Mourinho's tutelage, in 2011 and is hoping his rise through the ranks to become first choice centre back at the Bernabeu will allow him to negotiate an impressive new deal.

But if Real bosses do not submit to the French international's demands he would consider a move to Stamford Bridge - and his close bond with The Special One would allow him to encourage Chelsea's interest.

Madrid have tried in the past to tie down their star youngster but without success and will be wary of Chelsea and Mourinho's interest which could see one of Europe's hottest prospects quitting the Spanish capital for a move to London.

Although a fee is yet to be considered with Varane's position uncertain, the bidding for any potential deal would likely start at around £25million.
