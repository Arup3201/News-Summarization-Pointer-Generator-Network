For the dog that's got everything, this could be the unique addition that sets tails wagging.

Snout and Paws, a boutique in London, makes bespoke dog clothing which can cost anything up to £900.

From sequin-studded leather jackets to raincoats and T-shirts, the luxury brand claims to offer 'the highest couture standards from the finest materials'.

Canine couture: Fanta the Dachshund models the kind of tailor-made jackets which sell for up to £900 at the boutique in London

Styling: Pattern Maker Irena Stankevica tailors a top-end suit to fit Fanta the Dachshund

Wardrobe: The coutique offers a range of canine outfits from leather jackets to t-shirts and raincoats

Andrey Savin set up the business after finding his own three Dachshunds, Fanta, two, Sanvy, 18 months, and Michka, 12 months, needed coats to keep them warm.

He has a boutique with a range of dogwear in varying sizes according to breed, as well as offering a made-to-measure service so that owners can create their pet's very own wardrobe from scratch.

Andrey said: 'We used to live in Russia where it is very cold and my dogs needed to be clothed in winter.

'My family has a lot of dogs and we found this to be quite a problem in the cold months. But no matter how much money you have, there isn't any clothing suitable for dogs.

'It's difficult to find something that looks good without it looking like you're trying to dress them up.

'My dog needs clothing, but I don't want people to laugh at her. Everything around is all themed or bright pink and never fits properly.'

Each canine customer goes through a number of strict fittings, to ensure their clothing fits just right, and owners can create their own look by choosing a style and material to suit their dog's shape - and wallet.

Andrey, 25, said: 'It's quite a complex process. We adjust it to the dog so it's quite time consuming.

'Quality is something we look for and so we use high quality fabrics to achieve a high-standard of finish.

AURA PARKA - £329

Description: 'This exceptional coat, by Snout&Paws, would compliment your dog’s wardrobe for many years to come. The combination of luxury leather with Toscana fur is a perfect balance between taste and sophistication.'

BOMBER JACKET - £249

'Crafted from supple, luxury  leather, Snout&Paws' bomber jacket is an iconic piece that will only get better with age. The perfect fit and versatile hue are sure to earn it a spot in your dog's year-round wardrobe.'

BOW TIE COLLAR - £114

'This bow tie collar is a perfect accessory for any occasion, and an ultimate fashion statement.'

RAIN JACKET - £219

'Nylon fabric, combined with supple leather, creates this timeless rain jacket by Snout&Paws. Its clean silhouette and waterproof qualities make it a perfect outfit for a rainy walk.'

JACK T-SHIRT - £79

'Pep up your staples with Snout&Paws’ breathable stretch jersey Jack T-shirt. Cut with a perfect crew neck shape, this versatile piece will effortlessly refresh your dog’s weekend favourites. It's designed to look even better with age.'

'Working with the owner, we design an idea that we have had and then create a preliminary template from a fabric of choice.

'We
adjust the pattern to the fit of the dog and then you take all the 
patterns in and fit them to the fabric that you are planning on making 
the clothes out of.

'Depending on the dog, each fabric will sit differently so each item of clothing is very different to create.

'We have to make sure the dog can walk, run and jump freely in the clothing.'

It
can take between three days and three weeks to create a dog's outfit, 
depending on the owner's requirements, and every last detail is hand 
stitched.

Custom-made: Each canine customer has to undergo a rigorous fitting process to ensure the dogwear is inch-perfect

Craft: London boutique Snout and Paws as a range of dogwear as well as bespoke tailoring service

Meticulous: Owner Andrey Savin said it can take between three days and three weeks to create each outfit

'We do the first sample and then we see how it fits on the dog,' Andrey, said.

'Then there is another fitting before we create the final sample, which is confirmed with the owner.

'It's all down to the customer and what they want for their pet.

'The last very bespoke item we made was a leather jacket with sequins stitched on, which cost £900. These bespoke items are very unique.'

Andrey's dog Fanta is the catwalk model for his designs, and she loves being in the limelight.

'She loves dressing up!' he said. 'The other two just want to eat the clothes, but Fanta is such a little poser.'

Snout and Paws, which began trading in October 2012, has a team of seven, including designers and production staff.

Also, with an online shop for ready-manufactured goods, dog owners can buy straight off the shelves for a more refined price tag.

Andrey, now from London, added: 'We are a dog tailor but we also offer a selection of outfits that we stock.

'We work with dogs of all shapes and sizes we offer extra small, small, medium and large in our manufactured range.'
