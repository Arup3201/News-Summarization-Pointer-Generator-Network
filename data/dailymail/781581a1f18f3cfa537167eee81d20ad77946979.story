Our cities are constantly growing, changing and evolving to meet the demands of swelling populations.

But how they look today is just one final outcome from many thousands of possible plans that would have been submitted and dismissed over the years.

This collection of maps of some of our best-known cities in the world shows how they could have looked today if these plans had been followed through.

In a 1948 plan, left, for a San Francisco highway, we see how, just like most of America's main cities, there were plans to completely carve up the city by the post-war highway building frenzy. Today, some of the city's central park areas would be completely different had the dotted-red express highway plans gone ahead

Some might argue that planners decades ago were short-sighted in not following these ideas through - particularly, perhaps, in Los Angeles where one proposal to build a fast and direct interconnected subway was halted even after tracks had been laid and tunnels dug.

The 1925 Rapid Transit Plan for the city and County of Los Angeles began being put into place, with the digging of trolley tunnels and the laying of some tracks. But all that was halted with the expanded use of the motorcar.

Today, however, much of this plan has now been seen through, with the current subway system following many of these original routes. If the subway lines are expanded out as is planned, LA will eventually have a transport system first designed 78 year ago.

In fact, transport systems appear to be the main submissions among this collection of urban plans, that have been debated and dismissed at the local authority level.

In Lower Manhattan, the booming period of the 1960s saw plans drawn up in 1966, left, to transform the area from a forgotten shipping district to a global financial power house, including the development of the World Trade Centre. Right, as it is today

This collection of maps forms part of a
 project by Andrew Lynch, which explores 'unrealised', or 'hyper-real' 
cities through the many plans that have been considered by officials but
 never adopted.

His Tumblr 
project refers to the cities that never were as 'dream cities' and he 
likes to imagine what life would be like in each urban metropolis if 
different decisions had been made.

'It’s about looking at the past through the present eyes and figuring out what they were trying to achieve,' he told WIRED.

But all that was halted with the expanded use of the motorcar. Much of the original plans have now been carried out with the city's subway system, right

But thanks to a 'Highway Revolt' by residents in the west-coast city, the planners never succeeded.

Angry
 citizens rallied against the construction of major trunk roads 
criss-crossing the city, a movement that was also successful in many 
other U.S. cities.

Today, many urban highways are being cut back or demolished entirely.

A 1945 plan for a Boston subway expansion shows how the Metro rail line was planned to reach Reading, Needham and Dedham.

Much
 of this plan was followed through, but the interesting thing about the 
proposal is the attention to detail in the map, with landmarks, stations
 and bridges included.

An 
even earlier map of east New York City shows just how far cartography 
has advanced. A 1929 'New York City Independent (IND) Second System' 
plan was put forward for a public-sector alternative rail service  to 
accompany the two existing private transit companies: the Interborough 
Rapid Transit Co. (IRT) and the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Co. (BMT).

The 1929 IND Second System plan, left, is today the subway under Second Avenue, which became known as the IND Second System. However, with the subsequent stock market crash a few months after the mayor's plans were submitted, the ambitious expansion plans were dropped. Right, today's subway system in the area

Mayor John F. Hylan, who had previously been fired by BMT, wanted to 'stifle the expansion of the private firms,' according to WIRED.

The plan pictured, is the subway under Second Avenue, which became known as the IND Second System. However, with the subsequent stock market crash a few months after the mayor's plans were submitted, the ambitious expansion plans were dropped.

Today, New York City’s current A-G lines follow IND’s original routes.

In Lower Manhattan, the booming period of the 1960s saw plans drawn up to transform the area from a forgotten shipping district to a global financial power house, including the development of the World Trade Centre.

Superblocks built on landfill would extend the footprint of the island into the East River, according to WIRED. The plans included new houses and offices, and new underground highways aimed to pull traffic off the streets.

The subsequent economic crash meant the plans took far longer to complete, however, and have never fully been realised. Battery Park City eventually was re-drawn up along more traditional planning lines and a 'Seaport City' along the East River remains the vision of today's mayor.

Across the Atlantic in Germany, there were grandiose designs drawn up for Berlin during the Second World War, as Adolph Hitler enviisoned the city would be the centre of the German Reich empire.

The dictator commissioned Albert Speer, his chief architect, to design a capital named Welthauptstadt Germania which translates to 'World Capital Germania', worthy of such an empire, according to WIRED.

Speer planned a vast north-south parade route with an underground highway. At one end would be a massive new train station; at the other a gigantic Volkshalle, or 'People's Hall' would have been the largest indoor space by volume.

In the middle of the parade an enormous, 1,000ft tall arch, large enough to stand over Paris's Arc de Triomphe would tower.

Far from being Hitler's vision of the centre of his empire, Germany's defeat meant Berlin eventually became carved up and divided from east to west.

On a map of central Berlin today, Hitler's grandiose empirical designs are nowhere to be seen

Some of the world's best-known cities may have looked quite different today if previous plans had been adopted

From super highways carving up San Francisco to extended rail lines in Boston and the Bronx, some of these designs have eventually been adopted over the decades, while others have been campaigned against and dropped
