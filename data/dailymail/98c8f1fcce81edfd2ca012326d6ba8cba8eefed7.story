Rising tensions in Italy's parliament came to a head today as MPs brawled - while controversial prime minister Silvio Berlusconi frantically tried to convince Europe he could save the country from financial meltdown.

The punch up erupted as MPs from the Northern League took on members of the opposition FLI party - headed by Berlusconi's former ally Gianfranco Fini who split with the sleazy 75-year-old politician following his numerous sex scandals.

The Northern League MPs saw red after Fini appeared on Italian TV to discuss Berlusconi's proposed pension reforms, which he had agreed with Northern League leader Umberto Bossi - allegedly in return for the prime minister to step down in January and make way for elections.

Speaking on a popular political show Fini had ridiculed Bossi and said that 'everyone knows his wife retired at 39' which prompted heckling in parliament from supporters of both men and which eventually led to blows being exchanged in amazing scenes.

Marco Reguzzoni accused Fini of 'scandalous behaviour' and once he had finished speaking Claudio Barbaro of the FLI and Fabio Rainieri of the League squared up to each other and started trading punches as colleagues dived in to pull them apart.

At one point both men had grabbed each other by the throat as two other MPs also tried to join in and the brawl was eventually broken up by ushers and deputy speaker Rosy Bindi was forced to suspend the session for several minutes until calm returned.

The speaker was also forced to apologise to a group of children who were in parliament to see how MPs worked and who had to hear the air turn blue as insults were traded as well as punches and she added: 'I'm sorry you have had to see this very unedifying spectacle.'

The fight took place as Berlusconi travelled to Brussels to assure European Union chiefs that he was working to balance Italy's book and that he would usher in reforms to promote economic growth in what is the third largest economy in the Eurozone.

Italy has a debt of more than £1trillion - or 120% of its GDP - and there are real fears that it could head the same way as Greece and tumble into a financial abyss with Britain and others in Europe having to foot part of the bill for a bailout.

Bossi has steadfastly refused to make big concessions to Berlusconi on the League's objections tochanging Italy's generous pension system as part of reforms demanded by European leaders but reports in Italy today said he had agreed if the prime minister resigned and held early elections.

Berlusconi is said to have persuaded the League, whose support he needs to keep his coalition government afloat, to accept a gradual increase in the retirement age from 65 to 67 and in return the 'pact' for him to step down by January was agreed, according to Italian newspaper reports.

However the reports were denied by his spokesman Paolo Bonaiuti and by the Northern League with one ally of Berlusconi simply dismissing it as the 'usual theatre of politics that had no truth in it whatsoever' insisting that he would stay on until elections scheduled for 2013.

The punch up came as Berlusconi travelled to Brussels with a 15 page letter of intent which he said outlined his plans to save Italy and would give details of proposed growth and further explanation of his belt tightening 54 billion Euro austerity package introduced in the summer.

However political commentators have said that the proposals are simply not enough and are simply 'ideas' that have to be approved by parliament and are unlikely to get the go ahead as he has a slim working majority and 'will not be enough to assure Europe and the markets.'
