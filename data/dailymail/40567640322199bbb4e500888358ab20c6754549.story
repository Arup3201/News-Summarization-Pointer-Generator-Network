Gareth Barry has praised teammate Steven Naismith for helping Everton overcome the loss of injured Ross Barkley at the beginning of this season.

The Scotland international has arguably been the Toffees best player in the opening stages of this campaign, scoring in each of his first three games against Leicester, Arsenal and Chelsea.

Barry has credited the 27-year-old for his goals and a relentless work ethic that he claims few players can rival.

Speaking to the Liverpool Echo, the former England international said: 'He knows his role and is a very clever player.

'He is doing exactly what is asked of him and his work rate is second to none. There are not many players out there that puts in the shift he does.

'Not only that, he is scoring goals and helping the team. He is doing both brilliantly.'

Naismith's form has mean't the loss of Barkley, who suffered medial ligament damage on the eve of the Premier League, has not been so sorely felt.  

'We said at the time that it would be somebody else's chance if Ross is going to be out for a little bit,' said Barry.

'Whether Naisy was going to play anyhow against Leicester nobody will know, but he has taken that chance.'
