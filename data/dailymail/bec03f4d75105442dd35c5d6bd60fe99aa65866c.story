Women who do strenuous activity two to three times a week are 20 per cent less likely to suffer heart problems, new research says 

Exercising vigorously for just ten minutes twice a week is enough to help middle-aged women avoid heart disease, a study has found.

Women who did strenuous activity two to three times a week – enough to cause sweating or a fast heartbeat – were 20 per cent less likely to suffer from heart problems, stroke and blood clots than inactive women, researchers said.

Those who did gentler exercise, such as walking, gardening or cycling, four to six times a week had the same reduction in their risk of heart disease.

Indeed, doing any physical activity at all was found to lower risk by a certain amount, compared with being inactive.

But surprisingly, getting active more than three times a week did not result in a further drop in risk. 

The chance of heart disease was no lower among the small proportion of women who did some strenuous activity more than three times a week than among those who did so two to three times.

The Oxford University research, which is published in the journal Circulation, is based on data from more than a million UK women who took part in the Million Women Study, a major health project that was started in 1996.

The latest analysis was funded by the British Heart Foundation, the Medical Research Council and Cancer Research UK. Lead author Dr Miranda Armstrong, a physical activity epidemiologist, said: ‘Inactive middle-aged women should try to do some activity regularly.

‘Positively, the research showed that every effort to be physically active could contribute to improving heart health. Women who were active two to three times a week were able to cut the risk of heart disease substantially.’

The finding comes during the British Heart Foundation’s Heart Month, when the charity is urging people to spend ten minutes each day making small lifestyle changes to improve their heart health. 

Doireann Maddock, senior cardiac nurse at the BHF, said: ‘This research reinforces evidence that you don’t have to run marathons or spend hours at the gym to improve your heart health.

‘Even if you don’t have much time to spare, just a couple of weekly sessions to get your heart rate going can help to reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke.’

Tom Stansfeld, of Cancer Research UK, commented: ‘This study shows how important physical activity is for your health – and it’s not only your heart that stands to benefit.

‘Even small amounts of physical activity can reduce the risk of breast, bowel and womb cancers.

‘Being active in any way you can – even if it’s just walking to the station or getting off the bus a few stops earlier – is a great thing for your overall health.’

Britons are advised to do at least 150 minutes a week of moderate activity. But almost a third get less than 30 minutes of exercise a week, and one in ten does not manage to walk for more than five minutes at a time over a month.

A can of sugary drink a day increases your risk of dying from heart disease by a third, health campaigners warn.

They have unveiled a poster campaign to highlight the risks of drinks such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi, which they say are linked to tooth decay and type 2 diabetes, while a can a day could lead to weight gain of over a stone in a year.

The campaign, called GULP – Give Up Loving Pop – comes from the Health Equalities Group, based in Liverpool and funded by the NHS and local authorities. 

Director Robin Ireland said: ‘Few people fully realise the harm that sugary drinks can do to your health. . . We’ve launched our GULP campaign to get the message across and take the fight to the manufacturers.’

Soft drinks are now the largest single source of sugar for teens and children aged four to ten. Many groups want a tax on the drinks to reduce consumption and fund health schemes. 

Recent research by the University of Liverpool suggests a 20p per litre tax in London alone could prevent 1,100 cancers, 6,300 cases of type 2 diabetes, and cut the number with heart disease and strokes by 4,300. Such a levy would add around 7p to the price of a standard can.

The British Soft Drinks Association accused the campaign of ‘scaremongering’.
