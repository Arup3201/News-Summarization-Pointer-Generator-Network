Avoided jail: Lisa Morris was told to remove her son's Xbox and get him out of bed in the morning

A mother has been ordered by a court to send her 13-year-old truanting son to school after he turned up for just 40 days in seven months of classes.

Lisa Morris was told to remove her son Liam Foster’s Xbox, send him on a stop-smoking course, and get him out of a bed in the morning.

She avoided jail despite him turning up for school on 40 days out of a possible 150 - while the attendance record of her other son, Callum Barks, 15, was also of concern, Cannock Magistrates’ Court in Staffordshire was told.

Morris admitted she had failed to make sure both boys were turning up at Abbot Beyne School in Burton between January 1 and May 13 this year.

Staffordshire County Council said Liam had only attended school on 40 days out of 150. His absence was unauthorised on 86 of those days.

The court was told that Callum’s attendance record was also of concern, but particular attention was drawn to that of Liam.

Khalid Mahmood, prosecuting on behalf of the council, said education welfare officers had carried out a number of home visits at Morris’s address to try to resolve the situation.

He said: ‘Lisa Morris was advised by the education welfare officer to exercise parental controls such as removing Liam’s Xbox and TV controls.

‘Liam was also told to attend meetings with the smoking cessation service and Miss Morris was told to make sure he was awake at 7.30 each morning.

‘Liam’s attendance levels did improve as a result, but there were problems again in June when Miss Morris went on holiday.’

Mr Mahmood also told magistrates that Morris had a previous conviction for failing to make sure her daughter was regularly attending school in 2008.

Morris said that she had found it very difficult to make sure that both Liam and Callum were attending school on a regular basis.

She told the court that Callum now took a taxi to school each day in order to make sure that he got there on time.

Prior to sentencing, magistrates told Morris that they took absence from school very seriously and had taken her previous conviction into account.

The chair of the bench told her: ‘We have
 listened to what has been said and attendance at school is something 
that is very important to the bench.

‘We do take non-attendance at school seriously and have taken into account the previous conviction.

‘We hope that Liam in particular 
continues to engage with professionals. It is important that he starts 
the beginning of the new school year.’

Magistrates
 handed Morris a six-week jail sentence, suspended for 12 months, with 
12 months supervision. She was also ordered to pay costs of £250 and a 
victim surcharge of £80.

They warned her that should she commit any other offence during this time, then the terms of the suspended sentence could be activated in another court.

A court order preventing the naming of Morris and her sons was lifted following an application to magistrates by the Burton Mail newspaper.

Abbot Beyne School is a comprehensive school catering for about 750 pupils aged between 11 and 18. The attendance rate at the school in 2013 was 94.2 per cent, which fell 0.4 per cent on 2012.

This rate is about average for the country. In its last Ofsted inspection, the school was told it 'requires improvement'. Main criticisms included weak teaching and poor attainment in the sixth form.
