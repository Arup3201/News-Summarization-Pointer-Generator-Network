Chelsea assistant first-team coach Steve Holland has told the Blues' fringe players to look to the example of Frank Lampard ahead of the Capital One Cup third-round tie with Bolton.

The Blues plan to rotate their line-up for the visit of Wanderers, who have one Championship win this season, during a congested period.

Lampard, who scored 211 times in 13 years at Chelsea, netted against the Blues for Manchester City on Sunday in the Barclays Premier League and always acted with the utmost professionalism, Holland says.

Holland, undertaking media duties prior to Wednesday night's game at Bolton in place of manager Jose Mourinho, said: 'When Frank Lampard played in the Capital One Cup against League Two opposition and League One opposition, he played the game as though it was the World Cup final. Maybe that's why he has had the career he has had.

'And I would suggest that is probably a good line for others to follow.'

Goalkeeper Petr Cech, second choice this season behind Thibaut Courtois, is among those who could get an opportunity alongside young talent.

French defender Kurt Zouma, 18-year-old Danish defender Andreas Christensen, English midfielder Lewis Baker and Dutch defender/midfielder Nathan Ake - who has already graced the first team - are all in contention.

The quartet were retained in Chelsea's first-team squad this season while 26 others went out on loan.

'No matter whether you are old or young, you want to play,' Holland said.

'And if you don't want to play, you shouldn't be here. That's how you want your players to be. Managing that on a day-to-day basis is a challenge.

'We're hopeful whoever gets the chance to play will stake a claim for a place long term - that's the objective.'

The Bolton contest comes as the second of five games in 14 days, with Aston Villa, Sporting Lisbon and Arsenal to follow.

'We need all of our players,' Holland said.

'One of the most difficult challenge that a manager at a big club has (is that) you don't just have a team of very good players - you have a squad of very good players.

'That sounds good, but there is a flip-side to that. Without being disrespectful, that's a challenge for Liverpool this year.

'They have a bigger squad of more quality players and picking the right ones for the right matches and the ongoing communication with all of them and keeping them chomping at the bit is a challenge.

'There does come a point when they do need to play. And we are entering a period now where I'm sure that will occur.

'We have total faith in all of our squad. Jose has said he is very happy with the squad.'
