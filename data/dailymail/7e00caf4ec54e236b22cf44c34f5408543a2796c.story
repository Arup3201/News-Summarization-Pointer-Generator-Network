It's often called the most important meal of the day, vital to set you up for hours of work or play.

But, according to new research, British people are struggling to fit breakfast into their increasingly hectic schedules.

A survey found the average person takes less than seven minutes to wolf down their morning meal and more than a third skip it altogether.

Only half eat breakfast every day, with 40 per cent telling researchers they have rushed the meal - with the average time taken just six minutes and 15 seconds.

Two-thirds of Brits surveyed eat breakfast on the go - some in the car and on public transport

The poll of 2,000 adults, by oat drink producers Oatly, also revealed 34 per cent of people don't eat anything before noon.

Only half eat breakfast every day, with 40 per cent telling researchers they have rushed the meal - with the average time taken just six minutes and 15 seconds.

The most common reasons are rushing to work (58 per cent), starting work too early (24 per cent), waking up late (18 per cent), being distracted by the children (16 per cent), the school run (14 per cent) or a long commute (12 per cent). 

Two-thirds (65 per cent) admit munching breakfast while getting ready, more than a quarter (27 per cent) eat in the car, while 15 per cent admit eating on public transport.

Weekends see the nation take the most time over breakfast, with an average of 13 minutes and two seconds spent enjoying the first meal of the day on Saturdays and Sundays.

Those who do make time for breakfast are more than likely to do so while listening to music (86 per cent) to perk them up for the day ahead.

2. The Beatles - Here Comes the Sun

3. U2 - A Beautiful Day

4. The Monkees - Daydream Believer

5. The Killers - Mr Brightside 

Pop is the number one morning mood-lifting musical genre (60 per cent), with Pharrell Williams' chart-topper Happy (25 per cent) named the ultimate track to accompany breakfast.

However, nearly half (45 per cent) say they don't even have time to put the radio on in the morning.

Neuroscientist Doctor Jack Lewis, co-author of Sort Your Brain Out, said of the findings: 'Music is one of the very best tools available to every one of us, enabling us to shift our brains into a different gear.

'Its mood-altering impacts are extremely well supported by decades' worth of scientific research. Using music to get us into the habit of making a little extra time each morning to give our brains the right fuel to kick start our day can only be a good thing.'

He added: 'A nutritious breakfast is also brilliant for brain-hacking, which refers to simple adjustments to our behaviour that get our brains working better.'

Toni Petersson, chief executive of Oatly, added: 'A healthy breakfast makes starting the day a lot easier, so it's a shame to see so many are rushing it, or even skipping it altogether.

'It seems many are trying to eat as quickly as possible in the mornings, so the joy of sitting down to our most important meal is being forgotten.
