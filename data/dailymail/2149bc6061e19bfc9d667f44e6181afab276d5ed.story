For a man who has made billions from encouraging the world to share, it was a very private event.

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg married his girlfriend of nine years on Saturday – in a ceremony so secret that even the guests did not know they would be attending a wedding.

They turned up at Zuckerberg’s £4.5million home in Palo Alto, California, thinking they were there to celebrate Priscilla Chan’s graduation from her degree in paediatrics.

True love: Priscilla Chan, the new Mrs Mark Zuckerberg, was walked down the aisle last Saturday by the couple's dog Beast, a Hungarian sheepdog. The couple also wrote their own vows

Married: The couple have been together for nine years, but did not reveal their engagement

But instead they were greeted by Zuckerberg – who famously always wears jeans and hoodies – in a navy suit and tie, and his bride in a wedding dress.

Zuckerberg, 28, and Chan, 27, spent four months planning the wedding, but had not publicly revealed they were engaged.

The only announcement came after the event – and, of course, appeared on Zuckerberg’s Facebook page, where he posted a picture of himself and his new wife and changed his relationship status to ‘married’.

The day before the wedding, Facebook floated on the stock market and his fortune rose to £12billion.

But despite this, Zuckerberg’s nuptials remained relatively modest, with £7.50 meals of Mexican food from his favourite local restaurant for the guests, who numbered fewer than 100.

Performer: Billie Joe Armstrong, the lead singer for Green Day, arrived with his wife Adrienne in town and carrying a Gibson guitar. He provided entertainment for the newlyweds, playing 'My Last Night on Earth'

Dessert was a selection of chocolate mice at £2 each, and the venue was the back garden of his five-bedroom home.

It is not known whether the couple, who met at Harvard, signed a prenuptial agreement to protect Zuckerberg’s fortune in the event of a break-up.

If they did not, California divorce law works under the principle of ‘community property’, where anything earned by either party during the marriage is divided 50-50.

Ms Chan graduated from medical school at the University of California, San Francisco, on Monday, the same day Mr Zuckerberg turned 28.

The couple have been together for more than nine years and a source at the wedding said Mr Zuckerberg designed the ring featuring 'a very simple ruby.'

The guests all thought they were coming to celebrate Ms Chan's graduation but were told after they arrived that the event was in fact a wedding.

'Everybody was shocked,' the source said.

Couple: Ms Chan and Mr Zuckerberg met when they studied at Harvard and have been together ever since

Guests: Those invited thought they were attending a party to celebrate Ms Chan's graduation

Arrival: Guests were pictured turning up at the Palo Alto home on Saturday afternoon

Mr Zuckerberg invited Green Day lead signer Billie Joe Armstrong to entertain his wedding guests and celebrate the ceremony.

A video TMZ filmed outside Mr Zuckerberg's home reveals that he played 'Last Night on Earth.'

Mr Armstrong told guests he wrote the song for his own wife.

In addition to the live performance by Mr Armstrong, TMZ says guests partied to Flo Rida, Bon Jovi and Janet Jackson.

However, the Facebook family favorite appeared to be Michael Jackson. Neighbors reported hearing the King of Pop more than any other artist.

According to a source the timing was not tied to the IPO, since the date the company planned to go public was a 'moving target'.

Private: Mr Zuckerberg is known to be secretive about his personal life despite running a social network

Drinks: The Facebook founder ordered large amounts of alcohol in anticipation of the party

Despite his strong advocacy of online openness and sharing, and scant regard for web users' desire for privacy, Mr Zuckerberg has long been secretive about his own personal life.

It was not even widely known that the Facebook founder was engaged to Ms Chan, despite the length of their relationship.

Even after Friday's IPO, Mr Zuckerberg remains Facebook's single largest shareholder, with 503.6million shares.

And he controls the company with 56 per cent of its voting stock.

The site, which was born in a dorm room eight years ago, has grown into a worldwide network of almost a billion people.

Flotation: Mr Zuckerberg opened trading on the Nasdaq last Friday, the day of Facebook's IPO

Mr Zuckerberg founded Facebook at Harvard in 2004, in a saga which would later become the basis for Oscar-winning film The Social Network.

He was named as Time's Person of the Year in 2010, aged just 26. Mr Zuckerberg grew up in Dobbs Ferry, New York.

Despite the hype over Friday's initial public offering, the share price fell flat by closing bell, finishing at only 23 cents more than its expected opening price.

Millions of new investors will be wary come next week amid fears as the IPO failed to match expectations.

However, the slightly underwhelming impact of the big day will do little to dent Mr Zuckerberg's mood, considering that he is believed to have landed nearly $20billion from the deal.

He is not alone in striking it rich from the IPO - other Facebook investors to profit include co-founder Eduardo Saverin and U2 frontman Bono.
