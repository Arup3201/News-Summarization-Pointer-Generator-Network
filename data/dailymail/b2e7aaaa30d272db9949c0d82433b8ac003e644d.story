Actor Bill Nighy has revealed he measures his life in Champions Leagues and has an obsession with his own mortality which sees him 'think about death 12 times a day'.

The 65-year-old, famed for his roles in Love Actually and State of Play, said he hoped not to retire, but to instead one day go to bed and not wake up.

An avid football fan, he has also revealed how he spends his free days drinking coffee and walking through London before settling in to watch recorded football matches on Sky Plus.

Actor Bill Nighy, pictured with Dame Judi Dench in their latest film The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, has said he measures his life in Champions Leagues and thinks about death '12 times a day'

In an interview with The Observer, he was asked if he could imagine ending up in a retirement home like that depicted in his latest film, The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.

He replied: 'I’m hoping not to retire. What do we hope for? Go to bed and don’t wake up, I suppose.'

He added: 'I probably think about death 12 times a day. I measure my life in Champions Leagues. How many do I have left?' 

His latest film, The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, follows on from the slow-burning success of 2012's The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.

Nighy stars in the movie alongside Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Dev Patel and Richard Gere, and plays one of several pensioners who have moved to a retirement hotel in India run by Patel's character Sonny.

Nighy found a new audience in 2003, playing the ageing singer Billy Mack in the film Love Actually, in which Keira Knightley and Hugh Grant also appeared.

Since then, he has been inundated with film work including roles in the Pirates Of The Caribbean and The Girl In The Cafe.

In 2008, he split from his long-term partner, actress Diana Quick, after 27 years. The two met while Nighy was performing at the National Theatre, in 1981 and have one daughter together.

Although they never married, Ms Quick once described him as her 'de facto husband' or POSSLQ - Person of the Opposite Sex Sharing Living Quarters.

Nighy is set to star as Sergeant Wilson in the highly-anticipated upcoming film adaption of Dad's Army.

Filming is currently underway for the contemporary version of the classic BBC television comedy series about the bumbling members of a Home Guard unit during the Second World War.

Acting alongside him in the star-studded cast is Sir Michael Gambon, who will play Private Godfrey.

Dad's Army, which originally ran from 1968, sees all of its most memorable characters brought back for the movie makeover, including Captain Mainwaring (Toby Jones), Pike (Blake Harrison) and Fraser (Bill Paterson).

But the Hamish McColl screenplay writes in numerous new female characters, including Rose Winters, played by Hollywood royalty Catherine Zeta Jones.
