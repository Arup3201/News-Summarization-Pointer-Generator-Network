A man dressed as Mr Incredible when he punched and bodyslammed a woman playing Batgirl on Hollywood Boulevard last year has been found guilty of battery.

Muhammet Bilik, 35, was sentenced to a day in jail, three years probation, 20 days of roadside cleanup and 36 anger-management classes in Los Angeles, California on Tuesday.

The scrap, which was caught on camera and shared to YouTube, unfolded in front of TCL Chinese Theatre on October 22 as stunned tourists walked nearby.

Bilik, dressed as Mr Incredible, can be seen holding onto Batgirl as entertainers dressed as Star Wars' Chewbacca, Where's Waldo and mass murderer Freddy Krueger approach. 

A video captures the moment Freddy Kreuger, Where's Waldo and Chewbacca tried to stop a fight between Mr Incredible and Batgirl on Hollywood Boulevard last year. Mr Incredible has now been convicted of battery

Backup: They managed to separate the duo, who were scrapping over sidewalk territory on the strip

They attempt to break up the fight and Waldo manages to drag Bilik away from the woman.

But Bilik apparently finds her in the crowd again and throws her to the ground before tourists then step in to pull him away.

The video of the incident, captured by FilmOn, was shared online and went viral.

Police did not know the identity of Mr Incredible until Batgirl reappeared on the street a few weeks after the incident, and police interviewed her about the brawl, authorities said.

Prosecutors say Bilik attacked the woman following a disagreement over sidewalk territory along Hollywood Boulevard.

City Attorney Mike Feuer said in a statement after Bilik's conviction that the decision was an important one. 

'Hollywood Boulevard is famous around the globe and attracts millions of visitors every year. We must keep it safe,' he said. 'The characters who interact with children and family along Hollywood Boulevard have to obey the law.'

Bilik has also been ordered to keep away from the Hollywood Entertainment District throughout his probation. 

Mr Incredible is the father of a family of superheroes in the hit 2004 Disney-Pixar film 'The Incredibles.'

It is just the latest arrest on the strip, according to the Los Angeles Times.

Among them, SpongeBob SquarePants was questioned by officers after an altercation with two women in 2011 and two Captain Americas and a Spider-Man got into a brawl in 2013.

The behavior became so bad a few years ago that officials held a 'superhero summit' to lay down the law, the LA Times reported.
