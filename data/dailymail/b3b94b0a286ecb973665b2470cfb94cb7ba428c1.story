A hotel price-fixing scam that led to guests being overcharged for rooms on ‘discount’ websites has been brought to an end following an investigation by the consumer watchdog.

The Office of Fair Trading probe found some hotel chains had joined forces with booking sites, meaning the ‘cheap’ rates offered online were really the same as the normal price.

As a result, people shopping around for cut-price rooms on the internet have been wasting their time.

Agreements: Expedia was one of the websites involved in the discount capping deals with hotel chains

The OFT probe looked at the activities
 of the InterContinental Hotels Group, plus Booking.com and Expedia. 
Both  sites entered into agreements with the chain that restricted their
 ability to discount the rate for room-only hotel bookings.

The
 ‘sweetheart’ deals have now been blocked by the OFT. All three 
companies have signed a legally-binding agreement to end the 
price-fixing regime, to avoid legal action. It is hoped the move will 
bring about a 10 to 20 per cent reduction in rates.

But
 some industry insiders believe the new regime will make little 
difference. This is because the agreement contains several small-print 
clauses which mean travellers will have to jump through hoops to make 
sure they get access to the best discounts.

Families will have to sign up to a membership scheme of the online travel agent (OTA) or hotel to be able to view specific discounts.

Before people can book any discount deal they must first have made at least one undiscounted booking with the agent or hotel.

The discounts offered by OTAs will be funded through their commission or margins.

Booking.com: The OFT found hotel chains and travel websites had been capping discounts so people shopping around for cheap rooms have been wasting their time because websites and hotels charge the same

Consumers' anger over rip-off holiday prices has been boiling over in recent days. Eariler this week one man's rant about the hike in the cost of Center Parcs holidays during school holidays was shared 143,000 times in Facebook.

But while officials can do little about companies choosing to raise prices to make the most of spikes in demand, the sweetheart deals between hotel chains and online resellers could have fallen foul of the Competition Act.

The OFT investigation into the issue was triggered four years ago by British businessman, Dorian Harris, the founder of the discount rooms website Skoosh.com, who complained rivals tried to put him out of business because he undercut their prices.

He said: ‘We started getting some calls from angry and confused hoteliers insisting that we were selling their rooms too cheaply.

‘I realised a website had been on to them threatening all sorts of nonsense if they didn’t either remove their hotel from Skoosh or force Skoosh to raise its prices.’

He added: ‘I had hotels calling me and emailing me to raise my prices. I found out that other hotel booking websites were then also tipping off the hotels about my prices.

‘Soon I found the wholesalers who provided me with rooms stopped working with me. I would say that I lost about 70 per cent of my business.’

The Crowne Plaza in Bloomsbury: Booking.com and Expedia each entered into separate agreements with the chain which restricted their ability to discount the rate at which room bookings were offered

Mr Harris, feels the changes announced by the OFT do not go far enough. The German authorities are about to outlaw any price agreements between hotels and travel agents.

He warned the deal signed by the hotel groups and travel agents only runs for two years.

‘I really can’t see these proposals will offer any meaningful savings. We should just have a free market in hotel rooms where prices are clear,’ he said.

OFT senior director, Ann Pope, insisted that consumers will see benefits.

‘The travel industry, fuelled by the internet, has seen significant changes in recent years, and we want to ensure those changes continue to work in consumers’ interests,’ she said.

‘That is why we are pleased to have secured this outcome which, by allowing OTAs and hotels to offer discounts, should increase competition and mean travellers across Europe can benefit from reductions on hotel accommodation throughout the UK.

‘By shopping around, people can compare the different discounts offered by hotels and OTAs, and ensure they get the best deal.’
