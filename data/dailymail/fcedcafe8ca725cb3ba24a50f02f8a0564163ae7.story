On my way home from White Hart Lane on Sunday evening, I sent Steven Gerrard a message as I do after most Liverpool games.  

Normally I’ll ask him how he felt the match went or for his views on any major talking points but this time, having watched Liverpool dismantle Manchester United, no questions needed answering. So I punched the words ‘Twice as good as 2009’ into my phone.

I know what it is like to go to Old Trafford and win by three goals but I couldn’t tell you how it feels to go there, play United off the park and make them spend the last 10 minutes chasing shadows as Liverpool’s ecstatic fans shout ‘Ole!’ with each tormenting pass.

Togetherness: Liverpool were outstanding at Old Trafford, despite United's indiscipline

Look familiar? Gerrard kissing the camera in 2009, and again on Sunday after scoring his second

Close: Carragher tackling Ji-Sung Park in 2009. Liverpool ended up four points off United

When we won 4-1 in March 2009, the 
final score was a little distorted.

Don’t get me wrong, our display was 
superb but we had to deal with spells of pressure, trailed to a 
Cristiano Ronaldo penalty and only pulled away in the last 13 minutes 
with two goals after Nemanja Vidic had been sent off.

I
 remember the celebrations in the away end being raucous and we were 
delighted as we walked off the pitch, yet our elation was tempered.

We 
were still four points behind United, having played a game more. We 
hoped we would win the title but they still held the upper hand.

Sunday’s
 performance, however, was completely different. United may be an 
inferior side to the team they were five years ago but that should not 
detract one bit from what Liverpool did to them.

The intent was there 
from the first kick and 6-0 at the final whistle wouldn’t have been 
flattering.

What’s more, the
 impact of the result and performance will have been felt across 
Manchester at the Etihad Stadium, reaching Stamford Bridge and the 
Emirates Stadium in the process. Nobody will dare underestimate 
Liverpool now.

Manuel 
Pellegrini, Jose Mourinho and Arsene Wenger will have looked at the two 
games Liverpool have just faced, away trips to United and Southampton, 
and probably expected them to return with, at best, four points.

That
 they have come through them with six unanswered goals, maximum points 
and confidence soaring will be causing Pellegrini, Mourinho and Wenger 
concern. The more they get into this race, the more impressive Liverpool
 look.

Contrast: Suarez gives his side the thumbs up as Wayne Rooney complains to his team-mates

Identical: The penalties were similar, but Liverpool are far and away a better side than United this term

Times are changing: Manchester United fans show their emotions in the stands as their side crumbles

On fire: Back then, Fernando Torres was Liverpool's hit man. Now Luis Suarez is more than filling his boots

Full credit to 
Brendan Rodgers, who is handling the situation supremely well. What you 
get with Brendan is exactly what you see.

In his interviews and in the 
technical area, he never gets over-excited, always remaining in control.

That’s
 what you want from a manager — focus and composure, a clear plan and 
unshakeable belief in his methods.

He is a coach who thinks 
progressively, coaxing improvement from his players with encouragement 
and giving them opportunities.

We
 get told constantly about the problems with the British game.

How 
players can’t play the right way or retain possession, yet here is a 
British manager defying the critics and showing it is possible for young
 players to play with style and great technique.

All yours: Gerrard celebrates as Wayne Rooney scratches his head in dismay

Up and down: United are now 14 points behind Liverpool, who are now major contenders for the title

He
 has been repaid with consistent performances and increasingly 
impressive results and you only have to see how Jon Flanagan, Raheem 
Sterling and Jordan Henderson have come of age during this campaign, 
maturing from boys to men.

Sterling
 must now be a certainty to make the World Cup squad. He knows how to 
use his explosive pace and he has an end product to go with his skill. 
Flanagan, meanwhile, is putting himself into contention to be on the 
plane.

England are well 
stocked for full backs but if something were to happen to Glen Johnson 
or Kyle Walker, Flanagan should be the first port of call. He is more 
than just someone who can make a tackle and he is versatile, uses the 
ball well and is growing in confidence.

In his wake: Jon Flanagan put in a fantastic performance at Old Trafford, one of many this season

Wing wizard: Liverpool's Raheem Sterling has been in magnificent form in recent months

As it stands: The Premier League top four, but Liverpool's big games are at Anfield

On course for glory: Chelsea currently lead the Premier League despite their weekend slip-up

Been there, done that: City won the title two years ago, can they repeat the feat?

Kings of north London: Arsenal won at Spurs to keep their title dreams alive

What
 I like most about Brendan is that he is brave. Some managers won’t 
tackle issues but Brendan is proactive. Within weeks of  getting the 
Liverpool job, he sent Andy Carroll, the  British record transfer fee, 
out on loan to West Ham. The popular Pepe Reina, similarly, was loaned 
to Napoli.

His handling of 
Luis Suarez, most impressively, was strong. Even when Luis was trying to
 force through a move to Arsenal, Brendan wasn’t afraid to discipline 
him, making him train on his own after he had overstepped the mark with 
comments he made in the media.

Brendan
 has the trust of his players and they respond positively to how he 
treats them. He is honest and wants to help them improve. He places a 
big emphasis on having respect and the camaraderie between coaching 
staff and squad is evident.

No messing around: Rodgers shipped £35million signing Andy Carroll out to West Ham on loan immediately

Achievement: It took Rafael Benitez a few years to push Liverpool up to title contenders before leaving the club in 2010, despite winning the Champions League in his first season in charge

Success elsewhere: Gerard Houllier delivered on the cup front but only got close to the title once

The great: Winning the title would be on a par with Bill Shankly's FA Cup triumph in 1965

On a par: Bob Paisley's European Cup success of 1977 would also be matched with a title win

Liverpool,
 certainly, have the momentum with them and the biggest compliment you 
can give Brendan is that he has manoeuvred the club into a position to 
challenge for the title so quickly; Gerard Houllier and Rafa Benitez, 
for instance, took four seasons to get there.

If
 Liverpool were to do it, the achievement would be on a par with Bill 
Shankly’s FA Cup triumph in 1965 or Bob Paisley’s European Cup success 
of 1977. Even though Liverpool have won 18 titles, this would feel like a
 first, such is the hunger and desire to get there.

Will
 they do it? They definitely have the right weapons. Liverpool look 
strong whereas you can question their rivals: will Chelsea pay for the 
lack of a top-class striker? Is Manchester City’s defence strong enough?
 Do Arsenal have the players to produce when it matters?

Six pointer: Liverpool face Manchester City at Anfield on April 13. They lost the reverse fixture 2-1

Vital: They then host Chelsea on April 27, who they also lost 2-1 to at Stamford Bridge

There
 will be more twists and turns and Liverpool are going to have to 
prepare themselves for something not going their way over the next nine 
games. How they handle a tense situation will be the real test.

I am certain, though, that the two Anfield games against Chelsea and City will determine the outcome of the title race.

The
 best atmosphere I ever played in was in 2005, in the Champions League 
semi-final, when we beat Chelsea 1-0, a night when the  stadium 
literally shook. Should  Liverpool repeat that score on April 27 the 
atmosphere, like Sunday’s performance at Old Trafford, will be on 
another level.

Tough: Brendan Rodgers has made some brave decisions since being appointed Liverpool boss in 2012
