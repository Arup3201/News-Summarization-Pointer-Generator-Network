Three years after 20-month-old Ayla Reynolds mysteriously vanished in the middle of the night, Maine police are still looking for her and have made no arrests in the case.

The toddler was reported missing from her father's home in Waterville, Maine on December 17, 2011, sparking one of the state's largest ever searches. A body has never been found.

Investigators do not believe she wandered off or that she was abducted in the middle of the night. Instead, they believe her father, his girlfriend and sister know more than they are saying.

Ayla's father, Justin DiPietro, his girlfriend, Courtney Roberts, and his sister, Elisha DiPietro were all in the house when the little girl vanished. Her blood was later found in the home.

Questions: Ayla Reynolds was 20 months old when she vanished from her father's home in Waterville, Maine in December 2011. Three years on, no arrests have been made in the case

'We've said for a long time now that we're looking for answers to the questions we've asked and we just don't feel like we've gotten those answers yet,' Maine State Police Sergeant Jeff Love told the Morning Sentinel.

As the three-year anniversary of her disappearance approaches and police still have no answers, Love, the case's lead investigator, has vowed never to give up.

Speaking to the Sentinel, he recalled how family members had claimed they had last seen the little girl in bed the previous night. She had been dressed in pajamas and had her arm in a cast.

With temperatures dropping, the call launched massive searches on the ground and in the air by local departments, state police, the FBI and residents, but she was nowhere to be found.

After 10 days, the case became a criminal investigation.

In February 2012, police confirmed had found traces of the girl's blood in multiple places inside the house, and cars belonging to DiPietro and his girlfriend were seized by police.

Ayla's mother, Trista Reynolds, previously claimed that police told her they found blood droplets on DiPietro's sneakers, on his mattress and sheets, on Ayla's slippers and across the face of her doll.  

She also alleged that police showed her pictures of blood splashes on the floor and walls.

Reynolds has called on police to press charges against the three adults, but authorities say while they believe a crime was committed, they do not have enough evidence to bring charges.

DiPietro, who had custody of the girl, has previously said that he believes someone abducted his daughter after she was put to bed.

He has not commented on who he thinks is responsible but has maintained his innocence.

In a separate case in July 2013, DiPietro was charged with assaulting an ex-girlfriend in Portland.

Prosecutors dropped the assault charges, saying the ex was uncooperative, but he was sentenced to four days in jail for violating conditions of his release following the charges. The violation stemmed from him having alcohol in his car despite his bail conditions stating that he was not to possess any.

Authorities told the Morning Sentinel that it's possible charges could be brought in Ayla's case in the future if there is enough evidence - and authorities are not giving up.

'Our work will not stop until we find Ayla,' Love said.

'I can't imagine what the family has gone through, and that's part of that determination, day in and day out, to do everything we can to try and bring closure to the family.'
