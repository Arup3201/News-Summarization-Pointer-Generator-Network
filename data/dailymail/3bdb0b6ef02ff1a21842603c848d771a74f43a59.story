An animal shelter has banned members of the public from looking at its dogs, claiming that large amounts of visitors are 'extremely stressful' and harms their well-being.

The rule comes into force next week at the Coco Markus kennels in Godmanchester, Cambridgeshire, run by the charity Wood Green.

Visitors to the centre will now have to fill out a form before they can see any dogs, and members of staff will suggest them matches.

Ban: Members of the public will no longer be able to visit the dogs at Wood Green shelter in Cambridgeshire without proving their interest in re-homing one of the animals

Welfare: The shelter says its new policy is in line with other animal charities, and was prompted by scientific research

The shelter says this is necessary because many visitors have no intention of adopting a dog, and seeing lots of people can make the dogs less healthy and well-behaved.

According to studies of sheltered dogs, excessive visits can lead to the dogs hiding, panting and barking more than usual. This in turn could make them less attractive to those who genuinely want to give them a home.

Conclusions: Studies suggest that dogs which are visited excessively are more prone to barking, panting and hiding from their visitors

Linda Cantle, the shelter's head of animal welfare, said that they made the decision because they must put the animals' welfare first.

She said: 'We understand that some people will be disappointed by not being able to visit the dogs; however our animalsâ€™ welfare is always our overriding priority,' said Linda Cantle, head of animal welfare.

'Research carried out last summer revealed that on average just 15 per cent of the visitors to the kennels were interested in re-homing a dog.

'For dogs, the rescue kennel environment is extremely stressful. We have introduced a number of techniques to reduce the negative effect but we are still seeing a deterioration of behaviour and health in the dogs in our care on a daily basis.

'We are confident managing the number of visitors to the kennel area will significantly improve the welfare of the dogs. Stress levels and the associated negative behaviours will be reduced.

'The improved kennel behaviour will result in enhanced interactions between potential re-homers and the dogs and therefore better and quicker re-homing prospects.'

Commenting on the changes of procedure, a
 spokesman for the centre said that allowing free access to the dogs was
 'doing them a disservice' and that they have received 'positive' 
feedback.

Shelter: The Coco Markus Kennels is in Godmanchester, Cambridgeshire

She said: 'Our main aim at Wood Green is to re-home the dogs that have come into our care and to allow them every opportunity to be seen by their potential forever homes'.

'If they are frightened and are hiding because of the volumes of visitors we see their chances lessen in finding a home quickly. We believe we are doing them a disservice to allow this to happen.

'The feedback so far has been positive. We are a nation of animal lovers and we want what is best for the dogs.'

One well-wisher, Sonia Reilly, said: 'Well done Linda and Wood Green. This will ensure only genuine adopters view the dogs, and not the hordes of people who clutter up the place using it as a free viewing zoo.

'Kennels are extremely stressful places, and doing this will make the environment a little less stressful for the animals.'
