The shape of the British coastline is being changed for ever by storms that continued to lash the country yesterday.

Some of our most famous natural landmarks have been washed away by the driving rain and howling winds.

Swathes of Chesil Beach were lost to the sea and a 150 million-year-old stack known as Pom Pom Rock has collapsed on the Jurassic Coast in Dorset.

The latest damage followed the total 
destruction of a rock arch at Porthcothan Bay in north Cornwall. It came
 as forecasters released a weather map showing that all areas of England
 and Wales are now at risk of flooding. Police told residents near 
Chesil Beach in Dorset to move to upstairs rooms facing away from the 
sea, while three severe flood warnings, the highest level, were issued 
in the county.

The Environment Agency confirmed that a large amount of shingle on the beach had been ‘displaced by the heavy weather’.

Elsewhere, storms from the Atlantic continued to bring heavy rain on to saturated ground, putting added pressure on swollen rivers. Seven people have died and more than 1,700 homes and businesses have been flooded in England since the beginning of the Christmas period.

The Environment Agency map showing the shocking extent of flooding in Britain revealed there are 360 flood warnings or alerts in place for England, Wales and Scotland.

The Met Office said heavy showers, some with hail and thunder, would continue to lash parts of Britain today – as statistics showed some of us saw our wettest December in more than half a century. About 6.5 inches (165.1 mm) of rain fell in the South East last month – the most since 1959. Scotland endured its wettest month since records began in 1910, with 11.7 inches (296.1mm).

Environment Secretary Owen Paterson insisted that flood management was ‘a real priority for this Government’, which was working closely with councils and insurers.

Caution: 360 flood warnings or alerts were issued around England, Wales and Scotland, with three severe warnings in Dorset

Struggle: Villagers in Muchelney on the Somerset Levels use a tractor to transport them through the flooded roads

Astonishing: People photograph enormous waves as they break on Porthcawl, South Wales, where very strong winds and high seas create dangerous conditions

He told the House of Commons that some energy network companies had been too slow to restore power to thousands of homes affected by the storms and floods over Christmas.

His statement came as the misery continued for many communities.

Flooding in the Somerset Levels has left villages cut off, and roads and buildings damaged. Waves of up to 27ft have been recorded at Land’s End in Cornwall. In Aberystwyth, seafront properties along the promenade were again evacuated.

Searches are continuing in south Devon for missing 18-year-old student Harry Martin, who was last seen leaving his home to take photographs of the weather – with more than 100 people volunteering to look for him.

Destruction: A major cleanup operation has started on the promenade on Aberystwyth, Wales, United Kingdom

Officials around the country have pleaded with people to keep away from the coast as onlookers continue to put their lives at risk by watching high waves crashing on to land.

Meanwhile, tributes have been  paid to the man who died after  being washed out to sea in Cornwall on New Year’s Day. Harry Swordy, 27, from Guildford, had gone for a paddle with friends at Loe Bar beach in  Cornwall but was dragged out by a huge wave.

Friends Tom and Lou Luddington wrote online: ‘Harry was such an  amazing character, so full of life.’ Concern was growing for an elderly dementia sufferer who was known  to love the seafront after she went missing from her coastal home.  Shirley Coalbran, of Hastings, East Sussex, went to bed around 11pm but the 76-year-old then got up again and left her home.

A forecaster for Meteogroup said the weather would ease in the coming days. She added: ‘It will become less stormy and more settled, but temperatures are dropping.’

Precaution: Environment Agency workers check the river defence barriers on Osney Island in Oxford

Improvised transport: People wheel a canoe past the river defence barriers on Osney Island in Oxford

Travel: A resident uses a canoe as they paddle on flood water past houses flooded on the road leading to the village of Muchelney in Somerset

Looking out: Wave watchers get to close as the water covers the road in Porthleven. The Environment Agency said the risk of flooding continued this week

Destruction: The 18th-century pier at Portreath minus its 'monkey house' - a small stone hut - which was washed away by the massive Atlantic breakers this morning
