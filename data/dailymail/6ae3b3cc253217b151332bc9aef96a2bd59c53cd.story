A 75-year-old woman who received a letter of apology from the career criminal who burgled her home felt so sorry for him that she sent him £20 in prison.

Kevin Derbyshire, 24, and an accomplice stole £10,000 worth of jewellery when they raided the home of Loretta Smith in Bolton, Greater Manchester.

The men were caught after footage of the raid, taken from a camera on Mrs Smith's property, was posted online.

Both Derbyshire and his accomplice, Graham Llewellyn, also 24, wrote to Mrs Smith as they awaited sentencing for the crime. 

Derbyshire promised to buy her a bunch of flowers and 'the best bottle of wine he could afford' and apologised profusely for the crime, which he said he committed while on Valium.

Mrs Smith said she felt 'so sorry' for Derbyshire that she decided to send him £20, explaining that she thought it was a 'normal' thing to do. 

She said: 'I'm sorry if people think I'm stupid but I don't think it was silly. 

'I thought his letter came from the heart but maybe I'm just gullible. 

'I'm hoping it will bring him to his senses and make him realise he has to go out and work.' 

Mrs Smith, who is company secretary of a taxi firm, has not replied to Llewellyn - who said that he was drunk when he raided her home. 

Most of the items stolen in the raid last August were returned but a diamond ring and bracelet have not been recovered and Mrs Smith was left with a £500 repair bill to a broken window. 

Details of the apology emerged at Bolton Crown Court where Derbyshire's lawyer used it to help with his plea for mitigation.  

Mrs Smith said: 'The police tell me these two men are prolific burglars and shoplifters and I'm told people like them send letters to victims because they are instructed by their solicitors to do so.

'But it was no big deal for me to send him money - it would be normal for me to do something like that and It was just something that I wanted to do. 

'I know it might not make sense but it did to me at the time. If people think I'm silly then hey ho.

'He wrote to me again but I haven't answered. When he wrote back he never mentioned the money but it may not have got to him at that point. 

'He did say when he comes out of prison he is going to buy me a bunch of flowers and the best bottle of wine he can afford. 

'The other guy has also sent me a letter but I haven't replied - he said that his wife had got a little boy and she had a daughter due and he was drunk.

The raid took place while Mrs Smith was at work after Derbyshire and Llewellyn spotted an open skylight window and climbed into the property.

Attempts were made to destroy a CCTV hard drive which had installed following a previous break in - but within 24 hours of the crime images from the camera clearly identifying Derbyshire and Llewellyn were posted on Facebook.

After seeing the pictures, Llewellyn bundled the stolen property into a black bin bag and left it outside Mrs Smith's home.

She said: 'They took a lot of serious stuff. There were several designer watches and an expensive one I got from the Caribbean with diamonds. 

'My ruby ring and diamond ring went and a diamond solitaire and my diamond eternity ring. It was absolutely terrible. 

'Derbyshire sent me a letter apologising profusely and said he was on Valium. He sent the letter to my house three weeks ago, it was in my mailbox with no name just the address.

'He just said he was very very sorry. His writing was appalling, really bad spelling. 

'He said it was only when he read it on Facebook that he realised what a horrible thing he had done and what people thought of him. I think that's why he wrote.

'I felt sorry for him. He obviously wasn't very bright. I thought "well there you go you've done it". 

'What touched me was the fact that he had been on Facebook and read all the comments and it had really upset him what people thought of him.

'I made it very short and sweet thanking him for the letter and said I was sure that he had not only upset me but he must have upset his partner or wife both financially and emotionally. 

'I thought at first I'd send him some stamps so he could send letters to loved ones - but I sent him £20. The lady at the prison said £20 was a lot of money but he will still need toiletries or whatever.'

In court Derbyshire's lawyer Nicholas Ross said his client was 'remorseful' and said of Mrs Smith's gift 'It was out of remarkable sympathy, and I might say, in an almost saintly way, a token of her generosity.'

Kate Harney, mitigating for Llewellyn, said his client was 'almost institutionalised' and had previously committed offences in order to go to jail where he felt more at home. 

But she added he was hoping to turn his life around after finding a partner and becoming a father.
