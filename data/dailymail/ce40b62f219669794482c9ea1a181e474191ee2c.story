Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho will put his feet up this weekend with his side absent from the FA Cup fifth-round ties, after that 4-2 humbling by Bradford, but the Blues boss will still watch out for a certain result in North London.

Mourinho will pay special attention to events at the Emirates on Sunday, hoping his friend and former assistant Aitor Karanka, who was his No 2 at Real Madrid for three years, can spring another shock and knock fierce rivals Arsenal out the FA Cup.

Karanka takes his Middlesbrough side to North London top of the championship and unbeaten in 10 matches, having knocked Premier League champions Manchester City out in the last round, and Mourinho believes it’s proof the Spaniard can cut it at the top level.

‘As an assistant he was humble, honest, loyal and part of my staff with his soul and his heart. I don’t know what he’s like as a manager but maybe he brought these human qualities with him,’ Mourinho told the Sun.

‘He certainly knows he needs to work hard every day, And especially he knows that in England.

‘Whether it’s the Premier League or the Championship, the difference between success or not is just a matter of inches.’

During his press conference on Friday Karanka claimed he has no need to contact his Chelsea counterpart, who guided the Blues to a 2-0 league victory over the Gunners at Stamford Bridge in October, as he draws up his masterplan to down the Gunners on Sunday.

'No, because in the same was as against Manchester City, it's easy to analyse them. It's difficult to play against them, but it's easy to analyse,’ said the Spaniard.

'It's going to be a massive game because everybody is expecting that we can beat them. Obviously we can beat them because we played very well against Liverpool and we beat Manchester City.

'But if we go there thinking it's going to be easy and we can beat them without playing our best, we could make a big, big mistake.'
