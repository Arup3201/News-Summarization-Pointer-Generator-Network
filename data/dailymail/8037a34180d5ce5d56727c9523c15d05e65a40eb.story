Tottenham Hotspur's starting XI exuded confidence and maturity in their 2-1 north London derby victory over Arsenal - despite Mauricio Pochettino fielding the side with the youngest average age in the Premier League this season.

The 11 Spurs players who started the match at White Hart Lane had an average age of just 24 years and 37 days.

Pochettino had enough faith in his players to field a young, and in many ways inexperienced, side in arguably Spurs fans' biggest match of the season - and the team certainly delivered.

Interestingly, Liverpool had fielded the youngest side in the 2014-15 season before Saturday's north London derby.

Brendan Rodgers sent out a side with an average age of just 24 years and 47 days against Aston Villa last month - and they came out as 2-0 victors.

There are only two other teams in the Premier League who have started sides with an average age of less than 25 years this season.

They are Manchester United - with Louis van Gaal fielding a side averaging 24 years and 153 days during their 2-2 draw at West Bromwich Albion in October - and Newcastle United - when Alan Pardew sent out a Magpies XI with an average age of 24 years and 225 days for their 2-0 win at The Hawthorns in November.

Interestingly, and perhaps unsurprisingly, Manchester City's youngest XI fielded this season is the highest in the Premier League.

Manuel Pellegrini's defending champions' youngest starting side this season won 3-0 at Southampton in November - and they had an average age of 28 years and 14 days. 

That also means that Man City are the only Premier League side whose youngest XI this season have averaged more than 28 years between them. 

However, it is Tottenham who appear to have turned their faith towards their youngsters.

And it was Spurs' 21-year-old home-grown striker, Harry Kane, who inspired the home side's victory over their north London rivals.

With Mesut Ozil having given the Gunners an early lead, Kane equalised for Spurs when he reacted quickest in the area to prod home a corner.

Then, with just minutes of the match remaining, Kane jumped highest to plant a wonderful header back across Arsenal stopper David Ospina and give Spurs the victory.
