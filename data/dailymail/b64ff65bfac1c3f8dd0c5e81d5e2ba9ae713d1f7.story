Zoe Smith is relishing the prospect of an England-Wales battle for gold with childhood inspiration Michaela Breeze at the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games.

Smith, 20, bagged a bronze in Delhi four years ago to become England's first female Commonwealth Games medallist.

Now she has her sights set on 58kg gold and thinks 34-year-old Breeze, who won gold in 2002 and 2006 and came out of retirement to compete at Glasgow 2014, is the main obstacle in her path.

Excited: Zoe Smith is relishing an England-Wales battle for gold at the Commonwealth Games

Champ: Smith has her sights on 58kg gold and thinks Breeze is her main obstacle to achieve it

'I think the gold may potentially be between myself and Michaela,' said Smith.

'I like Michaela. When I was young she was a bit of an idol for me and going head to head with her will be very exciting. There's no animosity between the two of us. It's a friendly Games and, if I don't win, I'd want her to.'

Smith had a spell out through injury in the aftermath of the London 2012 Olympics but is firing on all cylinders again now and is enjoying training under new coach Sam Dovey.

'I've been working very well with him. He believes I've got a chance to perform really well here and so do I,' she said.

'I'm a little bit nervous because body weight isn't going down the way I kind of I hoped it would but, other than that, everything is really good.

'I'm feeling well prepared and training well. Now I've just got to go out there and do what I usually do.'

Smith admits there are a lot of similarities between her Games debut in Delhi and that of 15-year-old schoolgirl team-mate Rebekah Tiler, who competes at 69kg.

'She's a similar age and she'll have the same kind do expectations and pressure from team-mates and the general public but I'm sure she will perform,' said Smith.

'I feel a lot more experienced this time. I'm four years older, I would say four years wiser too but I guess that' s up for debate!'

Tiler seems remarkably unfazed at the prospect of stepping into the Commonwealth Games spotlight.

In Smith's way: One highlight of the Commonwealth Games could be a potential head to head in Glasgow

'Things are going good, I'm training hard,' she said. 'I'm not nervous now, I think it will hit me on the day when I'm on the platform.

'I'll have plenty of support though. My family, my neighbours, friends and teachers.'

Smith may have more experience under her belt this time round but she still gets nervous and feels that often works to her advantage.

'I'm always a nervous wreck,' she said. 'I'm always nervous about everything. I do get the adrenaline kick and sometimes it will keep me up at night.

'The adrenaline will kick in after the weigh-in and when you're warming up. I find it's often a good thing to be honest. I can be warming up in the back room and feeling a bit heavy but then get out on the platform and the weights are flying.'

Smith, who had her funding cut by British Weightlifting shortly after her Delhi bronze because the governing body felt she was overweight, is confident that she, and other women lifters, are helping to make the sport more appealing for women.

'I think there's less of a stigma around it now,' she added. 'Lifting weights is becoming more of a normal thing for women to do. It's becoming a lot more fashionable so ideally we can be an inspiration to breaking down the social stigma around it. If the guys can do it, why can't the girls?'

Meanwhile British record holder Jack Oliver (77kg) is expecting a tight battle for the medals in his class.

'I'm in good shape and I think there will only be a couple of kilos between first and fifth in 77kg,' he said.

'That should make it a good competition to watch. It's harder if you're in it knowing one lift will make the difference between first and fourth but we do want weightlifting to be exciting.

'You get people coming to the Games who haven't seen weightlifting live before and I think they find it pretty impressive when they see what the women and men are capable of lifting above their heads and the speed of it. It's not something you see every day.'
