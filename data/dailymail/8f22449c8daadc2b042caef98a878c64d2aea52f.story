Those staying in Britain for the bank holiday - so-called 'staycationers' - will have to brace themselves for nightmare journeys as some 16 million vehicles are expected to hit the roads.

A number of festivals - including the Notting Hill Carnival in London - and sporting events have been scheduled to take place over the August bank holiday weekend, but those venturing out on the roads can expect major snarl-ups.

In addition, those planning on using the 
Eurotunnel may also be left frustrated, as the French drivers are 
threatening to strike over the weekend, meaning that services between 
Folkestone and Calais could be jeopardised.

Prepared for the worst: More festival-goers enter the muddy grounds at Reading, where water has been pumped from the site over the past week

Further, the Meteorological (Met) 
Office have warned Brits to expect inclement conditions - showers are 
forecast and temperatures will be cold across the country.

Drivers
will find that a number of roadworks on England's motorways and major 
trunk roads will have been completed by the start of the getaway, with 
others being suspended over the holiday.

But
more than 20 sets of works will remain in place and motoring 
organisations are expecting heavy traffic on routes to the coast and in 
areas where events are taking place, such as the Reading and Leeds music
festivals.

As thousands of Wellington Boot-clad revellers trudged their way into the grounds at Reading today, and with further rain expected, organiser Melvin Benn revealed that workers have been draining the site.

He said: 'We've worked night and day since [last week] to pump water off the ground, to pump water out of the ditches because we know we are getting more, so we needed to get as much off the ground as possible so that it's got somewhere to go.'

Up to 100,000 people were expected to attend the event which will be headlined by bands including My Chemical Romance, The Strokes and Muse.

Rainy day: Heavy showers and cold temperatures are expected over the bank holiday weekend, though by Monday there is a chance most of the country will be dry. Meanwhile, to accommodate track works, there will be 3,428 buses laid on over the weekend

FRIDAY: Heavy rain is predicted across the country, and thunderstorms will punctuated the day. While there will be some sunshine, temperatures are not expected to rise above the late teens - 16 or 17 degrees Celsius.

SATURDAY: Conditions will slowly improve, those most of the country will still be wet and breezy, particularly in the north.

SUNDAY: Expect a brighter day with sunny spells, though it will still be wet, again with the north of the country taking the brunt of the rain.

MONDAY: Most of the country will be much drier and clearer.

With so many cars on the road drivers have 
been warned to take extra care after a survey showed 71 per cent of 
motorists have lost concentration at the wheel in the last year.

The poll by road safety charity Brake and insurance company Direct Line 
found this was caused by worries about work, tension at home or 
inconsiderate road users.

Further, motorists are being warned about huge tailbacks tomorrow behind by a convoy of steam engines travelling towards the coast - at 5mph.

The 86ft long convoy, weighing more than 75 tonnes, will travel from Sussex to Dorset to take part in a rally next week.

But the 115-mile journey will take an estimated 30 hours to complete and cause huge tailbacks for tourists heading for the south coast.

Motorists are being warned of major delays on the B2237 and A24 in Sussex, A27 in Hampshire, A36 in Wiltshire and A354 in Dorset.

A spokesman for Wiltshire Police warned motorists to allow extra time for journeys and said: 'Due to the size of this "road train" it will be extremely slow moving and as it is travelling over a Bank Holiday it will have the potential to create congestion. 

'The estimated speed of this convoy will be 5 miles per hour. 

'Wherever possible disruption will be kept to a minimum but hauliers and motorists are asked to please be patient if they come across this load.'

On the move? Heathrow is expecting more than 852,000 passengers to journey through the airport over the weekend

Meanwhile French workers with the Channel 
Tunnel shuttle train company Eurotunnel are threatening a strike from 
tomorrow, having demanded an 8 per cent pay rise.

Eurotunnel has suspended bookings for
the Calais to Folkestone crossing on Saturday, Sunday and bank holiday 
Monday to safeguard journeys for those who have already booked.

The company said it still hoped to run a full service and its British staff were not involved in the dispute.

Over
25,500 vehicles - and 100,000 people - are scheduled to travel on the 
service from France to England during the three-day weekend.

And
between 12,000 and 15,000 travellers are expected to journey the other 
way, escaping to Europe for some bank holiday sunshine.

To
add to matters, rail travellers will have to put up with engineering 
work over the weekend, with buses replacing trains on some routes.

There will be 3,428 replacement buses running over the holiday weekend, compared with 3,339 last August bank holiday.

But Network Rail (NR) said 3.5 per cent more trains would be running over this August bank holiday than operated over the same period in 2010.

NR also said that only 4.8 per cent fewer trains would be running over the bank holiday weekend than on a typical Saturday, Sunday and Monday.

Even so, around 5.5 million people are expected 
to travel by rail over the weekend, according to Michael Roberts, chief 
executive of the Association of Train Operating Companies.

Travel organisation Abta said around 1.8 million Britons would be heading abroad from Friday to bank holiday Monday - roughly the same number as travelled overseas this time last year.

'This will be one of the busiest weekends of the year with most passengers on Friday,' said a spokesman for Stansted Airport.

'Some people will be going for city breaks over the bank holiday, while 
others will be taking the chance for some sun before the kids go back to
school.'

Around 250,000 would be flying from Gatwick airport, 260,000 from Stansted, 150,000 from Manchester, 65,000 from Birmingham, 24,000 from Leeds Bradford and 70,000 from Luton.

Also, 115,000 will leave from the main Scottish airports of Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen, while hundreds of thousands will be heading out through regional airports and over or under the Channel.

Heathrow is expecting more than 852,000 passengers to journey through the west London airport between Friday and Monday.

Heathrow's most popular destinations for the weekend are New York, Dubai, Dublin, Frankfurt and Los Angeles and Leeds Bradford Airport said around 24,000 passengers were expected to fly off for a break.

The most popular hot spots for those departing from the Yorkshire airport included the Spanish destinations of Majorca and Alicante, as well as Dublin and the Polish city of Krakow.

For those staying at home, the weather picture is mostly doom and gloom, according to forecaster Helen Chivers of the Met Office.

She told MailOnline: 'On Friday it looks as though it will be a showery day across the country. There will be some heavy and thundery showers, almost anywhere.

'The heaviest of the rain is likely to be across the eastern side of England. While there will be a bit of sunshine in between there will be predominantly heavy downpours and persistent rain.

'Temperatures will not be brilliant for the time of year, to be honest: they are expected to be in the high teens, so for most places they will be between 17 and 19 degrees Celsius. That is very low for the time of year.'

Jam-packed: Some two million people are expected at Notting Hill Carnival this bank holiday weekend

Party time: Revellers dress up for the Notting Hill Carnival, which began in 1964 in London

Music man: Norman Jay MBE plays one of his famous Good Times sets at the carnival, but will the weather be as sunny this year?

However, Mrs Chivers believes that the weather will slowly improve of the course of the weekend. She continued: 'We will still see some showers on Saturday, and it will be a breezy day, but there will be a mixture of sunshine and showers across the whole of the country.

'Some of those showers are likely to be heavy, particularly in the east and north. Temperatures will again be in the high teens - we might just get up to 20 degrees in the south.

'As we go in to Sunday and Monday I think we will see things improve a little bit more. Sunday's showers will be much lighter. Temperatures could get up to 21 degrees Celsius, especially in the south.

'The further north you go, the windier it is likely to be, and there is also the risk of rain from time to time. In fact there will be something of a north-south divide, in terms of the weather.'

Sunday is also the biggest day of the Notting Hill Carnival, and while 40 people have been arrested by police on suspicion of planning riots at the festival, up to two million revellers are expected.

The carnival has been going since 1964 and is thought to be the second most popular street festival behind the Rio Carnival in Brazil, and with luck the weather might be kind.

Mrs Chivers said: 'There is a small chance that there will be showers, and it will be breezy. But it should be a bright day with sunny spells. Temperatures should get up to 21 degrees. It is a favourable part of the country.

'And on Monday that slow improvement will continue and for most of the country it should be a bright day with sunny spells, and the winds should ease.

'It will never be particularly warm over the weekend, and it will be very showery, but it will improve by Monday.

'In Scotland, however, particularly on Saturday and Sunday, there will be fairly unseasonable weather with very heavy rain and strong winds. The further north you go, the worse the weather will be.'
