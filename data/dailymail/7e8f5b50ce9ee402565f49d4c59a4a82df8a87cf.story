With the car torn in two by the impact,  it looks like an accident with a tragic outcome.

But, astonishingly, a drink-driver and his 16-year-old passenger escaped from this horrendous crash with ‘miraculously light’ injuries.

Fearing for public safety, police had abandoned a chase in which the car reached speeds of up to 110mph.

Horrific: The stolen Ford Focus after being cut in two (rear part pictured further away) in the collision with a 4x4. No one was seriously injured

Christopher Jerman, 22, had taken the Ford Focus ‘for a spin’ after burgling his father’s house to get the keys.

He was jailed for 20 months and banned from driving for three years after a court heard he had a blood-alcohol level of 106mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood.

The legal limit is 80mg/100ml.

Jerman, of Holyhead, Anglesey, admitted burglary, aggravated vehicle taking and drink-driving in the incident last August.

After taking the car from his father’s house in Holyhead, he was seen speeding, shortly before midnight, by a traffic policeman on the A55 at the Britannia Bridge.

The sergeant followed as Jerman, who at one point switched off his lights, sped to 110mph in a 70mph area.

After a mile, he left the dual carriageway near Bangor and headed towards the city, doing 70mph in a 40mph zone.

The pursuit was abandoned and Jerman sped around a bend into a built-up area of Bangor.

Simon Mills, prosecuting at  Caernarfon Crown Court, said that shortly afterwards the Ford, travelling on the wrong side of the road, hit an oncoming Nissan Pathfinder 4x4.

The driver of the 4x4 escaped injury and his two passengers suffered only bruising.

Sion ap Mihangel, defending, said: ‘It’s a matter of providence [Jerman] is not facing a far more serious charge.’
