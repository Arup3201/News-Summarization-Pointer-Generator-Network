She has been pictured with a wealth of A list stars including Lady Gaga, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and Johnny Depp and sometimes spends up to 12 hours a day hunting down her favourite celebrities. 

And superfan Vanessa Sky Ellis's efforts are paying dividends - she has amassed a staggering 10,000 'selfies' of her with a variety of famous faces.

Legendary pop singer Cher even knows the name of the 26-year-old barmaid, who says that celeb spotting is 'the most important thing' in her life.

The New yorker spends time every day on the lookout for the cream of Hollywood and beyond having inherited her unusual hobby from her mother Annette, who died of a heart attack in 2007.

Vanessa said: 'I’ve waited outside hotels for celebrities to come out for 12 hours before - but there’s no better feeling than when you meet them. 

'I feel like I need to continue getting celebrities just the same way that my mom did.

'I’m completely obsessed - but it’s something I really enjoy.'

Before heading out in search of the rich and famous, Vanessa scans TV guides to find out which celebrities she is likely to find in her native New York.

Frequenting stage doors on Broadway and morning TV shows, Vanessa has managed to get up close and personal to stars such as Al Pacino, Jennifer Lopez, Katy Perry and Denzel Washington.

She said: 'Celebrities like Lady Gaga are really nice, they will stop for fans and let you take pictures with them.

'Then you have celebrities like Bruce Willis who will never, ever stop for fans.

'I would say I have at least ten thousand photos. In New York I can get about a hundred photos within two or three weeks.

Approachable: Vanessa says that while some A listers are friendly and happy to stop for a photograph, others will never stop for their fans. She is pictured with Mike Tyson, left, and Sharon Osbourne, right

'Celebrities are everywhere - I’ve found them just walking down the street or even at the train station. You have to keep your open because you never know where they’re going to be.'

Despite having a catalogue of personalities to choose from, Vanessa’s all time favourite is actor Johnny Depp.

She said: 'Johnny Depp is the most handsome man ever - he might be 50 but he’s beautiful.

'I’ve never considered cheating on my boyfriend with a celebrity, but if you had the chance with Johnny Depp what girl wouldn’t?'

And it’s not only Hollywood A listers than get her attention.

She said: 'One time I waited outside a hotel for twelve hours for Vanilla Ice. I love Vanilla Ice.

'While I was waiting I got ten celebrities, including Mike Tyson, so at least I was getting something.'

But while Vanessa shares her passion with a small group of autograph and celebrity enthusiasts, many people see her hobby as extreme.

She said: 'When Cher was in town I waited for a whole week to meet her. She actually knows me by name.

'A lot of people find what I do a little bit strange. I don’t think they understand exactly.

'But some people live their lives in their own little jars and don’t understand anything outside of it.'

And she has no plans to give up on her hobby just yet.

Big fan: Vanessa looks delighted to be photographed with The Wanted heart-throb Max George

She said: 'I don’t think I’ll ever stop getting celebrities.

'My dad doesn’t care for it too much - he just wants to make sure I have a job to support myself.

'I try to fit my work around hunting for celebrities.

'Sometimes you just have to go with just two hours sleep, but you know what, you’re still doing what you love.'
