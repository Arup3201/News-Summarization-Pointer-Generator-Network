Out of work: Chris Hansen, the longtime host of Dateline and To Catch a Predator, has not had his contract renewed by NBC

The host of 'To Catch a Predator' has been dropped by NBC after working for the network for 20 years.

It was announced on Monday that Chris Hansen will not have his contract renewed by NBC and the network gave no explanation for the decision.

The move comes just three weeks after his mistress released photos to RadarOnline of her kissing the married TV host, which she said she made public to counter his dismissal of the relationship.

Hansen previously said reports of the affair had been 'full of hurtful lies' but 32-year-old Kristyn Caddell proved otherwise with the photo of them kissing.

Miss Caddell met 54-year-old Hansen in Palm Beach, Florida, when she was a news reporter for NBC affiliate WPTV.

She claimed he led her to believe his 20-year marriage to Mary Joan was ending and he was therefore able to date.

The affair was initially reported two years ago by The National Enquirer, but it was not until Friday when any action was taken on part of the network.

In his two-decade career at NBC, Hansen has won seven Emmys for his work, as well as a number of awards for excellence in journalism.

'Chris has been a valued member of the team and we thank him for his many contributions to Dateline and NBC News over the last 20 years. We wish him the very best,' NBC said in a statement.

He already alluded to his future plans, putting out a statement at the same time as the NBC release and saying that he is looking into 'hosting and executive producing projects that will be announced in the coming months'.

Hansen, a father of two sons who is best known for his show that worked to arrest sex predators, had previously claimed evidence showing his alleged affair was just a picture of him going out to dinner.

'I understand the perceived irony of the, you know, so-called "gotcha guy" getting gotcha-ed,' he said in March last year. 'But what the "gotcha guy" got gotcha-ed doing was going out to dinner.'

The National Enquirer had revealed the affair after the pair were recorded enjoying a romantic dinner at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Manalapan, before spending the night at Miss Caddell's Palm Beach apartment.

However, in images Miss Caddell has released, Hansen is shown kissing her.

She claims he did not try to hide their relationship at the time, and she believed it was public knowledge before the Enquirer exposed it.

'Chris was flying me all over the country; putting us up in the finest hotels; having dinner and mingling with many of his colleagues; having our photographs taken together in public places ... Chris gave me no reason at all to believe our relationship was a secret and I trusted him explicitly,' she said in an open letter to the Enquirer earlier this month.

Miss Caddell said she decided to release the images because the affair was still affecting her ability to find work. She told the National Enquirer that potential employers told her they were put off because of the negative publicity surrounding her.

'For the past two years, I was told that it would be in my best interests not to say anything. Let it blow over. Just keep trying to truck along and keep trying to get jobs.

“But we are here two years later and I probably don’t go a day without an employer tell me they do not want to hire me because of the situation involving Chris Hansen.'

She added: “I thought by not saying anything, and Chris advised me that it would be in my best interest not to say anything, that I would continue to go and and my life would go back to normal. My life has been the exact opposite of that.'
