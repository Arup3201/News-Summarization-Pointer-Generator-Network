The average asking price for a property has reached a record high of £272,003 after a hike of nearly nine per cent in the past year

Asking prices went up by £9,409, or 3.6 per cent, between April to May - the biggest ever monthly leap, while the annual rise of 8.9 per cent crept close to the 10.4 per cent seen in October 2007.

As ever, London led the way, with a 16.3 per cent year-on-year increase, compared with a more modest 4.9 per cent in the rest of the country.  This suggested that the feared house price bubble had not stretched beyond the capital, Rightmove said.

Asking prices have soared nearly nine per cent in a year as demand outstrips supply, according to Rightmove

The average asking price in London is up by nearly £80,000 so far in 2014, or £4,405 a week, compared with £1,521 a week for the rest of the country.

Ten out of 32 London boroughs saw annual rises of more than 20 per cent, with a 43 per cent increase in Tower Hamlets driven by cash buyers and investors in Canary Wharf and neighbouring areas.

Rightmove said that across the country demand remained strong, and still outstripped supply.

An increase in new sellers earlier in the year was reversed in May as the number of homes being put up for sale fell by one per cent compared with April - a drop most likely explained by bank holidays affecting activity.

Rightmove director Miles Shipside said: 'The lack of fresh choice will frustrate buyers and lessen their negotiating power in popular locations as pent-up demand continues to be released.'

The figures come after fears of an overheating housing market failed to persuade the Bank of England to raise interest rates, with governor Mark Carney dampening expectations of an early hike.

Policy makers have said they will use other tools first, if needed, to cool the property market, before turning to this 'last line of defence'.

Earlier this month, the Bank's deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe warned that surging house prices could pose the biggest danger to the country's financial stability and it was the brightest of the 'blinking warning lights' of risk facing the UK.

Meanwhile, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has also recently sounded a warning that action may be needed to cool the market, calling for curbs on the Government's Help to Buy scheme.
