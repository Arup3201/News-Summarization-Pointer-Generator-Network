Even for a Hollywood lothario with hundreds of adoring female fans taking a girl to an X-rated movie on the first date is a brave move.

But as Bond girl Britt Ekland reveals, Warren Beatty's wooing tactics did the trick.

She admits that even though she was surprised by his choice of date they both headed back to a hotel room together soon after exiting the cinema.

Ekland, 27 at the time, tells Piers Morgan she wasn't 'a very forward girl', but was was seduced by Beatty, five years her senior.

Describing her encounter with the actor and director, she said while she thought he was 'pretty wonderful' for a while after that first date, her impression of him soon changed.

'I think he seduced me. I'm not a very forward girl. I wasn't then,' she said.

'Do you know what movie he took me to? And I have never told anyone - he took me to see a pornographic movie. I just wanted to get out of there. He had to leave too.'

Asked where they headed then, she said: 'I guess back to the hotel. Wouldn't you if you were at a porn movie with me?'

Ekland reveals much about her heartbreaks, including Rob Stewart's philandering and lack of remorse.

The pair met in 1975 and fell 'madly in love' but, while she thought it would last forever, it wasn't to be.

She said she found out he had cheated on her after a chance encounter at a party when she bumped into the actor George Hamilton, who broke the news.

'I wanted to throw up. I didn't believe it,' she said. 'I became anorexic and I had a really hard time, a really hard time. I had cocaine in those days when I was offered it.'

A 2010 biography of Warren Beatty claims that he has been to bed with 12,775 women.
