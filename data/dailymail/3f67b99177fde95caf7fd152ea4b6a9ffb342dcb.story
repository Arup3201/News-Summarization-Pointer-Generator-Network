As I posed for photographers on the Royal Albert Hall’s red carpet last week, my show-stopping, sequinned frock made me feel a million dollars.

And I’m certain that as I took to the rostrum to conduct a full orchestra and choir of 280 in Handel’s Zadok  The Priest at Symfunny — a musical event held in aid of the wonderful charity Parkinson’s UK, of which I am president — no one guessed my secret. For while my elegantly cut dress could easily have passed for a designer number worth thousands of pounds, it was in fact from High Street favourite Phase Eight — with a much more modest (although, admittedly, still significant) price tag of £295.

It is just one of a new wave of glamorous yet affordable red-carpet-worthy evening gowns hitting the shops in the nick of time for summer events.

These full-length frocks are brilliant for older women like me because, as is the case with chunky jewellery, I find that in my 60s I can wear things that would overwhelm a younger woman. Here’s my verdict on the High Street’s limelight-stealing dresses . . .

£295, phase-eight.co.uk

This is what I wore to the Royal Albert Hall and I adore it — it could easily be ten times the price. I associate Phase Eight more with reliable day wear than with evening sophistication, so this was a real find. It’s extremely comfortable, beautifully graded in colour, and the V-neck gives a flattering flash of decolletage.

£99, Debut at debenhams.com

A bargain, although that’s somewhat 
reflected in the quality — it looks far more elegant than it feels. The 
draping is kind to the figure, though, and I love the classic, subtly 
sexy design. Ideally the bodice would be boned and fitted, and the sheer
 top extended into sleeves, Grace Kelly-style, to make it perfect for 
all shapes and sizes.

Gold collar, £34.99, hm.com

I couldn’t believe this dress cost just 
£34.99, but when I put it on  I realised it looked  like something a 
footballer’s wife might wear. It looks and feels flimsy and absolutely 
necessitates a strapless bra. On someone 20 and tanned it might just 
work, but on me it looks as cheap as it is.

Navy sequin, £69.99, quizclothing.co.uk

The best value of the lot. Eye-catching without being tacky, it can be stepped into so you can do your make-up and hair before getting dressed. If my budget was under £100 this is what I’d choose.

Blue high neck, £275, Reiss at harrods.com

This seemed like a real winner at first.
 It’s well-made in a rich, silky fabric and fully lined, but to get it 
on, you have to pull it over your head, so I had to redo my hair and 
make-up.

Worst of all, the shape is unflattering.

Gold bead embellished, £184, debenhams.com

When I saw this I immediately thought 
‘mumsy’, but once I had it on, I loved it. An evening dress with sleeves
 is a fantastic find — perfect if you don’t feel confident about baring 
your arms. It’s also fully lined and easy to step into, and feels far 
more luxurious than I expected. Good price for the quality.

Burgundy multiway, £80, bhs.co.uk

This isn’t really a dress at all — it’s an elasticated skirt with two very long pieces of fabric attached at the waist.

The claim is that these can be used to create 15 different styles, but you’d have to be pretty clever to do it and  feel secure enough to  venture out.

Although it comes in a lovely range of colours and the  fabric is good, tying it is so fiddly I bet you’d wear it  once — before leaving it hanging reproachfully in the wardrobe.
