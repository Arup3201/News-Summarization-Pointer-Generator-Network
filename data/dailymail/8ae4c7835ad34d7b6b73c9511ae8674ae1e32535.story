Janusz Kosik murdered an innocent man over a noisy TV after he exploited EU border controls to settle legally in Britain

A convicted criminal from Poland murdered an innocent man over a noisy TV after he exploited EU border controls to settle legally in Britain.

Janusz Kosik, 57, had already served an eight year jail term for battering his pregnant girlfriend so badly she was left with brain damage and the baby had to be adopted.

Yet despite his conviction he was allowed to move to the UK without checks by the Home Office to work following the abolition of the Government's Worker Registration Scheme.

Within weeks of moving into a flat in Manchester, Kosik slashed and stabbed flatmate Radoslaw Waclawiak after flying into rage about their TV being too loud.

Fellow Pole Mr Waclawiak, 25, known as Radic was knifed in the heart and died later in hospital.

Kosik pleaded guilty to murder and was jailed for life at Manchester Crown Court, which heard the killer had a history of 'explosive violence'.

In 2002 while living in Canada, Kosik repeatedly beat his girlfriend into a coma while she was carrying his child during a row over money.

Their baby boy was delivered as she lay in hospital for six weeks with a severe head injury. But when she finally emerged from her coma, the victim didn't recognise the baby as her own or recall being pregnant.

She was left with the mental capacity of a four- to six-year-old and was expected to have to spend the rest of her life in care. Her son has since been adopted.

In 2004 Kosik pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and obstructing police and was jailed for eight years.

At the time a prosecutor in Canada said it was 'the most horrific case of domestic abuse you could imagine short of murder.'

Following Kosik's release it is believed he returned to his native Poland before taking up his right to work in the UK after the ending in 2011 of restrictions on incoming workers from eight Eastern European member states of the European Union.

Just weeks after moving into the flat in Crumpsall, Manchester, Kosik slashed and stabbed flatmate Radoslaw Waclawiak after flying into rage about their TV being too loud

He met Mr Waclawiak through their work at a car wash and they and two other Polish men moved into a flat in Martingale Court, Crumpsall, Manchester.

Mr Waclawiak gave his bedroom in the flat to Kosik, while he slept in the lounge, in an 'act of generosity' just two months before the murder.

But Kosik had violent mood swings and in the days before the killing Kosik threw a glass at Mr  Waclawiak which smashed against the wall. He also took a hammer out of the kitchen and threatened Radoslaw and the other two men.

The murder occurred last September after Kosik spent most of the evening in his bedroom and made complaints about the volume of the television.

Family say Radoslaw Waclawiak (pictured) had moved to England to try to find work and carve a better life for himself

At about 1am on September 22 Kosik stormed into one of the bedrooms were Mr Waclawiakwas smoking a cigarette. 

Police said Kosik went up to him with a large kitchen knife, slashed him in the face and stabbed him in the chest before fleeing the scene and leaving the victim to die.

He was arrested the following day as he loitered at a soup kitchen. Kosik must serve a minimum 21 years before being considered for parole.

Judge Andrew Gilbart QC told him: 'You inflicted a terrible attack. Given the presence of two wounds, I am satisfied that at the time of the blow being struck, you intended to kill him.'

After the case Senior Investigating Officer Harry Harrison from Greater Manchester Police said: 'Radoslaw came to England to make a better life for himself and instead was tragically killed by a man living under the same roof.

'The three men were kind enough to invite Kosik in to their home and viciously attacked and killed Radoslaw.

'Today's result should provide some solace for Radoslaw's friends and family and will hopefully provide some basis for them to move forward in their lives without him.'

The dead man's grandmother Halina Kroikowska said: 'Radic went to England to make a better life for himself.

'He was always a good boy and he was a very good grandson. Radic was only 25 years old, he was so young - why did this happen to him?'

The case comes as restrictions are due to lifted on citizens from Romania and Bulgaria coming to work in the UK.

Plans have already been drawn up for an advertising campaign denouncing Britain as cold and wet in a bid prevent a new influx of immigrants from Eastern Europe.
