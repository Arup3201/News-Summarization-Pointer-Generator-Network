When Belgium face Russia on Sunday we’ll see a team yet to live up to great expectations (Belgium) against one trying to impress a manager with great expectations and little human touch (Russia).

I can only speak for myself but I expected a lot more from Fabio Capello as an England boss. I’m sure that due to the injuries I had during his time, he’d probably say the same about me! But given his track record I expected more ideas and creativity. What we got was a prison camp mentality that stifled the life out of us.

His attitude was, ‘I’m the boss and you’ll do what I say’, all day, every day. Other managers I’ve worked under, including the best ever, Sir Alex, know that’s the way to behave in training and on match-day, but there’s a time and place when you can be accessible and open. With Capello it seemed there would never be warmth.

Midfield maestro: Eden Hazard will be pulling the strings for Belgium against Russia on Sunday

I felt his rigid 4-4-2 approach was ancient history and counter-productive. You get picked off like that when you need flexibility. I fear Russia will suffer if he’s taking the same approach.

Belgium, on the other hand, are brimming with excitement and have potential if they can gel at this level.

They showed fight and determination to come from behind in their opener.

And they have talent, Eden Hazard especially, but Romelu Lukaku has been disappointing and my concern is they’ll be less than the sum of their parts.

To celebrate the World Cup, I've added a special Unity Cap to my fashion range, incorporating all the flags of the participating nations and and with a share of the proceeds going to charity.
