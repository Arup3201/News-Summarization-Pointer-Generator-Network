Tottenham defender Kyle Walker looks likely to miss the start of the season as well as England’s Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland next month.

Manager Mauricio Pochettino said Walker has still not fully recovered from a pelvic injury. The 24-year-old right back has not played since March 13 and Pochettino doubts that he will be fit for Saturday’s visit to West Ham.

‘Kyle still has days when he does not have a good feeling but we believe he’ll recover soon,’ said Pochettino.

Tottenham are closing in on £2.75million Seattle Sounders right back DeAndre Yedlin.

Pochettino denied a deal had been completed for Yedlin but asked about potential signings next week said: ‘In football it’s possible and we will wait to see.’

Yedlin, 21, came on as a substitute in three appearances in the World Cup for the USA, and looks likely to make the move to London.

Pochettino will have to wait a little longer to see if Spurs can also bring holding midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin, with Southampton insisting that the Frenchman won’t be sold.

Meanwhile, Emmanuel Adebayor, who missed the club’s North American tour with malaria, scored as Spurs beat Schalke 2-1 at home on Saturday. Roberto Soldado netted Tottenham’s second.
