Vincent Kompany insists that Manchester City were 'forced' to spend big again this summer to offset the loss of players leaving the Etihad.

The Premier League champions brought in the likes of Eliquiam Mangala, Fernando and Willy Cabellero as well as signing free agents Frank Lampard and Bacary Sagna as they strive to meet Financial Fair Play restrictions.

Captain Kompany believes the deals - both signing new players and extending existing contracts - were essential if the club wants to remain competitive.

Speaking to France Football, he said: 'The summer reinforcements? People should see that as logical for a team like us, to get reinforcements every year.

'We are forced to. That is a fact. Joleon Lescott is leaving? We must get reinforcements for that position. Javi Garcia is leaving us? We have to add a player in that position.'

The Belgium international committed to a new long-term deal this summer along with fellow leading players Samir Nasri, David Silva, Sergio Aguero and Yaya Toure.

'To me the most important thing was not that I signed, but that I saw David Silva, Samir Nasri, Aleksandar Kolarov and Yaya Toure doing the same,' he added.

'That was a strong signal. All of those players could play for the top teams in the world, but they have decided to show faith in City and the project at the club.

'Personally, I have a very strong relationship with the club, so the decision to extend my stay was easy. I am looking to the future.'
