Kenny Jackett sits in a sunlit meeting room at Wolverhampton Wanderers’ training ground explaining how his genial manner hides a clinical disposition. He may be nice, but he can wield a knife.

This summer, as he plots a path for the club’s return to the Barclays Premier League, he has once again sliced eight players (earning a total of around £7million a year) from his squad, telling them their services will not be needed. That group, who are training separately from the first team and will not feature in pre-season games, includes Kevin Doyle, Jamie O’Hara and Roger Johnson — players with top-flight experience on seven-figure wages.

It is a hardline stance but Jackett, entering his 11th consecutive year in football management, knows there can be no softening of a policy that rid the club of the toxic atmosphere caused by successive relegations and gives his team a better chance of success on the field too.

They're back! Kenny Jackett guided Wolves to promotion from League One to the Championship in May

Some of the clubs who have enjoyed double success: 

Watford: Div 4 to Div 2 (promoted in 77-78 & 78-79)

Wimbledon FC: Div 4 to Div 2 (82-83 & 83-84)

Man City: Div 2 to Premier League (1998-99 & 99-00)

Hull: Div 3 to Championship (03-04 & 04-05)

Norwich: League One to Premier League (09-10 & 10-11)

Crawley: Conference National to League One (10-11 & 11-12)

Southampton: League One to Premier League (10-11 & 11-12)

Having begun the interview by offering a cup of tea, he offers his thoughts. ‘It was our ambition to only spend one year in League One. Some big clubs have stayed down for two, three, four years — both Sheffield clubs, Leeds United, Nottingham Forest.

‘I’ve seen when it’s two-and-a-half years before all those big contracts run out and you get a group of hungry young lads that nobody’s ever heard of coming through. They see the fantastic potential, the big crowds, and want to make a name for themselves.

‘What I tried to do was accelerate that process. We couldn’t drift along. We needed to have that type of turnover in one summer. I had the benefit of being a rival manager coming to Molineux. I felt the relationship between the crowd and players had broken down. Those players needed to be removed. It’s not a patient industry I’m in.’

As if to remind, a painting of a pack of wolves hangs on the wall.

Harsh words can be delivered humanely, however. ‘I just tried to be as clear as I could that they weren’t in my plans,’ Jackett, 52, continues. ‘Also, I felt they would benefit from a move. There were a lot of people who’d spent a few years in the Premier League and it’s quite hard to then come down.’

He adds: ‘As manager your successful times are when you are being proactive. In many cases you have to make the calls before the mistakes happen. After that, on a human level, the one thing you need to be is straight with people, to be open and honest.’

So it came to pass that only two members of the side who featured in the defeat at Brighton on the final day of the 2012-13 season — a result that underlined relegation for Wolves and saw angry exchanges between fans and players — appeared in the 6-4 win over Rotherham in April that celebrated immediate promotion back. The crowd was raucous that day, too.

Homegrown players such as Danny Batth, 23, and Jack Price, 21, blossomed, while signings Michael Jacobs, 22, and James Henry, 25, proved instant hits. Bakary Sako and Nouha Dicko are the duo providing continuity. Wolves clinched the League One title with a record 103 points as Jackett implemented an attractive passing game. Win or lose, players recognised fans with applause.

It wasn’t just a bloated squad Jackett trimmed for gains. The training ground canteen menu had swollen from players pushing their individual tastes. Too many cooks. Choices now are fewer and healthier but there is no Paolo Di Canio-style ban on tomato ketchup.

‘I felt the menu was catering to too many different opinions that weren’t the experts,’ says Jackett. ‘We employ a full-time sports scientist. His job is to dictate the menu, what is eaten, when and why.’

If last season’s goals were clear — right wrongs, lift the mood, gain promotion — this season presents a more complex landscape. But Jackett has one vision. ‘It again is to try and go up,’ he says without hesitation. ‘Three lucky teams will get into the Premier League by the end of this Championship season. We want to be one of them. Wolves are big enough to be competing.’

Jackett is wise in the ways of promotion. As a member of Graham Taylor’s Watford side of the 1980s he reached the FA Cup final and was capped 31 times by Wales before retiring aged 28 after knee injuries, going into coaching early.

Confrontation: Wolves supporters were upset with Doyle and Roger Johnson after relegation in 2013 

In the late 1990s, as assistant to Taylor, he saw Watford into the Premier League after successive promotions then, as No 2 to Ian Holloway, helped Queens Park Rangers go up from what is now League One. As manager, he took Swansea from the bottom rung as they began their ascent up the leagues, while Millwall reached the Championship under his guidance.

Wolves, though, is a chance to show his teeth. ‘Do I hope there are many more opportunities for me in the future? Yes. I suppose that will be dictated by how well I do at Wolves. I’m fully aware of the insecurities of football management.

‘I’d love to manage in the Premier League, I’d love to perhaps manage at international level. It is my ambition to go as high as I can.’

Do not discount the steel behind the smile.
