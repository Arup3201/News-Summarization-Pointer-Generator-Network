Biologist Dr John Bradshaw believes when cats are affectionate towards their owners they are treating them as other cats

Cats actually think their owners are just larger, non-hostile version of themselves, according to an expert in animal behaviour.

Biologist Dr John Bradshaw believes when cats are affectionate towards their owners they are just treating them as other cats. 

An upright tale is a greeting sign between felines and is also a way of cats showing affection to their owners. 

The biologist also believes that despite years of domestication, cats are still wild animals.

He writes: 'The transformation of the cat from resident exterminator to companion cohabiter is both recent and rapid, and—especially from the cat’s perspective—evidently incomplete.'

It has often been thought that when a cat brings home a dead animal it is a gift for its owner. 

However, Dr Bradshaw does not agree and believes cat remember they like tinned food when they re-enter the house and so leave the animal on the floor. 

Dr Bradshaw is a biologist who founded and directs the world-renowned Anthrozoology Institute, based at the University of Bristol. 

He has been studying the behaviour of domestic cats and their owners for more than 25 years, and is the author of many scientific articles, research papers and reviews. 

He is also the author of bestseller, In Defence of Dogs.

In the book he writes: 'One of my reasons for writing this book is to project what the typical cat might be like fifty years from now.

'I want people to continue to enjoy the company of a delightful animal, but I’m not sure that the cat, as a species, is heading in the right direction.

'The more I’ve studied cats, from the wildest feral to the most cosseted Siamese, the more I’ve become convinced that we can no longer afford to take cats for granted: a more considered approach to cat keeping and cat breeding is necessary if we are to ensure their future.'
