One of only two prototypes of the very first magnetic strip credit cards developed by IBM is up for sale for the first time.

Sotheby's are offering the relic of financial history for sale at their New York branch, with an estimate of between $10,000 to $15,000.

Made of card, with its magnetic strips printed stuck somewhat askew across both sides, the card has been carried for nearly 50 years in the wallet of its developer Jerome Svigals.

Relic of financial history: This unassuming oblong of brown card is one of only two of the original prototypes of the modern day credit card developed by IBM in the late Sixties

Credited with making possible today's trillion dollar consumer credit industry, the card is a unique piece of financial history.

While credit cards for individual companies had been in use in the U.S. since the Twenties, it was only in the Fifties that the idea of a universal credit card came into general use and acceptance.

However, these raised letter cards required extensive customer service and substantial time to process.

Seeking to create an application that would increase computer sales, IBM set about transforming the raised letter credit card to make it more efficient.

Going under the hammer: The card is available for sale at Sotheby's at an auction set for December 14, with an estimate of between £10,000 and $15,000

Also going under the hammer in the same auction as the IBM prototype credit card is this complete microfilm Bible, thought to be the very first book to make it to the moon.

One of 100 tiny Good Books carried aboard Apollo 14 on behalf of the Apollo Prayer League, the microfilm comes complete with a letter of certification signed by Apollo 14 astronaut Edgar Mitchell and James Stout of the prayer league's 'Governing Committee'.

NASA’s weight restrictions prohibited the transport of a convention book to the moon so in lieu of a large heavy codex, so microfilm was used to condense the 1,245 page King Hames version into the tiny 1.5in square.

Mitchell carried the microform bibles aboard the lunar module Antares, which landed on the Fra Mauro Highlands of the Moon on February 5, 1971.

The company's Advanced Systems Team, 
headed by Mr Svigals and Forrest Parry, settled on magnetic tape as the 
only convenient data storage method capable of easily accessing the 
necessary alphanumeric information.

Once the engineers decided on magnetic tape, the biggest challenge was designing a durable, inexpensive card. 

The earliest trials were done on cardboard, but quick progress with the invention meant that only two such prototypes were made before the plastic card was developed.

'IBM did the work for free and didn’t even patent the machine-readable card it came up with,' Mr Svigals said.

'Rather, it offered its solution gratis to all, assuming that the more transactions conducted using machine-readable media, the more computers would be sold to process them. 

'The strategy worked beyond anyone’s dreams.'

American Express in 1970 became the first company to take up IBM's new design, issuing 250,000 plastic magnetic strip cards which for the first time allowed customers to transact directly with banks and airport kiosks.

Consumers and the rest of the banks quickly adopted the idea and, by last year, more than 20billion credit card transactions were recorded in the U.S. alone.

Mr Svigals' prototype card goes on sale December 14 as part of a fine books and manuscripts sale at Sotheby's in New York.

On one side the magnetic strip has come away and been stuck back down with sellotape, but it is not thought to have affected the value of the almost unique item.

The only other example is kept at the Computer History Museum in California.
