Manchester United will hold a meeting on Friday to decide whether to spend big on a defender in the next two weeks.

Manager Louis van Gaal will meet United officials to formulate plans for this transfer window and the summer.

Buying a new right back will top the agenda with Everton’s Seamus Coleman, 26, and Southampton’s Nathaniel Clyne, 23, both candidates.

Van Gaal, who has spent more than £156million since last summer, wants to boost his chances of qualifying for next season’s Champions League.

His more serious spending will happen in the summer, with a central defender the priority, but a late move for Coleman or Clyne is not impossible.

Everton are adamant they will not sell, but United would expect to pay more than £20m — a huge profit on a player who cost just £60,000.

Clyne has also had an impressive season. After making his England debut he is arguably now his country’s first choice. Van Gaal will focus on buying a central defender in the summer, with Borussia Dortmund’s Mats Hummels and Schalke’s Benedikt Howedes on his radar. United are also keeping close tabs on Celtic’s Virgil van Dijk.

United will also discuss if it is time to offload a few players — Radamel Falcao among them. The Colombian was dropped last Sunday and it is looking unlikely that United will sign him on a permanent deal at the end of the season.
