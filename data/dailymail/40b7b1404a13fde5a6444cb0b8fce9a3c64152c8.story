Ten million people may have watched Carl's Jr. Superbowl ad featuring a seemingly naked model and their new 'all natural' burger - but it didn't make them want to take a bite. 

Advertising research firm Ameritest found that, although the ad featuring model Charlotte McKinney went viral, it failed to help sell burgers and even offended potential customers. 

Ameritest, which has tested thousands of ads for the industry and conducted the Carl's Jr. report for research purposes, found that only 27 per cent of the study's viewers planned to visit the fast food chain in 30 days after watching the Superbowl spot.

Advertising research firm Ameritest found that Carl's Jr. steamy Superbowl ad, featuring model Charlotte McKinney, failed to help sell burgers even though it received 10million views on YouTube 

The commercial features McKinney walking through a farmer's market, where she appears to be in the nude as suggestively placed melons and tomatoes cover her

That's in stark contrast to the 43 per cent of viewers, on average, who have answered yes to the same question when the firm has tested other restaurants' commercials, according to Advertising Age. 

The study also found that 52 per cent of viewers found the ad offensive and 51 per cent found it irritating and annoying.

'I love going all natural, it just makes me feel better, McKinney says. 

The model is then revealed to be wearing a beige-colored bikini, as viewers find out what she was really talking about was an all-natural Carl's Jr. burger - which she takes a big bite of.

Only 27 per cent of the study's viewers planned to visit the fast food chain in 30 days after watching the ad, compared to 43 per cent who have answered yes to the same question for other restaurants' commercials

According to the survey, thirty-two per cent of viewers felt worse about the restaurant after seeing the ad, a 24 per cent increase compared to how they felt after watching an average fast-food ad.

A spokeswoman for CKE restaurants, which owns Carl's Jr., said the Ameritest study was 'not consistent' with the fast food company's 'sales results'. 

'Sales for the Carl's Jr. All-Natural Burger reached a new high the week of the Superbowl broadcast,' she said. 

But Sean Scott, Ameritest's senior brand consultant, credits Carl's Jr.'s sales with the fact that the restaurant offered $1 coupons for an All-Natural Burger combo. 

Scott said the ad does 'nothing for the brand long-term'.
