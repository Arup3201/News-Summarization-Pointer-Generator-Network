When Rosemary McGinn sat chatting to herself or swayed backwards and forwards, her friends assumed she was just drunk - again.

But two years after she began acting strangely, she was diagnosed with a rare tumor on her pancreas that caused her blood sugar to drop, starving her brain and causing the 'drunk' episodes.

McGinn, a 54-year-old realtor from Rockland County, New York, was originally diagnosed with hypoglycemia and went everywhere with snacks and juices to keep her blood sugar from dropping.

She gained 25 pounds, but she saw that she had little choice.

Mystery: Rosemary McGinn, a 54-year-old realtor, acted drunk for nearly two years due to a tumor that was producing too much insulin, causing her blood sugar levels to drop and starving her brain of fuel

'When my sugar would suddenly crash, it was like I was drunk,' she told Medicine Matters. 'I would become very combative, not knowing what I was saying, and sway
back and forth.'

In one episode in Spring 2011, she was sent home from work early because her colleagues thought she was drunk, ABC News reported.

Shortly afterwards, she was driving with her husband but could not remember where they lived. She also forgot who the president was, and the year.

The next thing she could remember, she was in her kitchen with two paramedics who were feeding her candy to keep her blood sugar up.

Discovery: Dr Ronald Tamler, left, found that McGinn, right, had a tumor, even though she had been previously diagnosed with hypoglycemia. But even after this initial diagnosis and treatment, her episodes continued

At this point, she was diagnosed with hypoglycemia and would regularly snack - but still, her blood sugar dropped and she found herself in the middle of her 'drunken' episodes.

Rosemary McGinn was diagnosed with insulinoma, a 
rare tumor on the pancreas which is made up of islets - cells which produce insulin.

The body produces insulin in the presence of high blood sugar levels to reduce them. When sugar levels drop, the pancreas stops making insulin until the body has regulated the levels.

But in McGinn's case, the tumor meant she continued to make insulin even when her blood sugar level dropped too low.

It meant that her blood stream was fast losing sugar needed for fuel for red blood cells, which carry oxygen throughout the body. Without this fuel reaching the brain, it became starved and she started to become incoherent.

'I'd be having 3,000 different 
conversations with myself. It was scary,' McGinn told ABC News. 'I thought 
there's no way in hell I could live like this.'

Eventually having enough, she went to Mount Sinai Diabetes Center, where Dr Ronald Tamler found her blood sugar levels were dangerously low.

'A normal blood sugar is around 100 mg/dl, and most people start feeling poorly when their sugar dips below 70,' he said. 'But Rosemary had a sugar of 20.

'Some sugar needs to stay in the 
blood stream. It acts as fuel for red blood cells. if the
brain doesn't get enough sugar you're in real trouble.'

He said that her levels were so low she was susceptible to seizures and slipping into a coma.

She was diagnosed with insulinoma, a rare tumor on the pancreas that continues to make insulin even when the blood sugar level drops too low.

The pancreas usually stops making insulin until the body has regulated its sugar levels.

She was immediately referred to specialists at the Mount Sinai Medical Center and underwent an ultrasound so doctors could find the tumor, which was one centimeter in diameter.

Savior: The tumor was removed at Mount Sinai Medical Center in January and she has now recovered

The tumor was safely removed in surgery and during the procedure, McGinn had to be kept on a sugar IV drip to prevent her from having one of her episodes.

McGinn needed to stay in hospital for three days after the surgery, which was held in January, but has since returned home and is enjoying being free of her 'drunk' episodes.

She is now starting to lose the weight she piled on with all of her emergency sugary snacks.

'For almost two years, I wasn't living,' she said. 'They basically saved my life.'
