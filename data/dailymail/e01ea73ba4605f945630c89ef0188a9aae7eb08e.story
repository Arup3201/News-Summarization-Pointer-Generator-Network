The benefits of the annual flu jab have been ‘over-hyped’, scientists claim.

They say the vaccine is far less effective than is widely believed, with some studies showing it protects less than two-thirds of the population.

The US researchers say ministers  in Britain as well as America are ‘wasting taxpayers’ money’ on the jab.

And they claim that because the benefits have been so ‘over-promoted’, scientists have been deterred from inventing vaccines that would be far more effective.

Flu jabs are a waste of taxpayer's money due to the protective effects of the vaccine being over-hyped, it has been claimed

Is the flu jab a waste of taxpayers' money?

But the Department of Health has 
insisted the flu jabs ‘save lives’ and urged the elderly and patients 
with long-term conditions to come forward for their vaccinations.

Researchers from the University of 
Minnesota looked at 12,000 studies on the effectiveness and safety of 
the flu jab, going back to the 1930s.

They say that although Government 
officials claim it protects between 70 and 90 per cent of the 
population, this is actually not the case.

In fact, they say, it protects just 59 per cent of adults aged 18 to 65, but is far less effective in the elderly.

Professor Michael Osterholm, who was 
involved in the study, said: ‘I have been a strong proponent of 
vaccination in general, and flu vaccine in particular, for many years. I
 still recommend its use as the best we have.

The report's author, Professor Michael Osterholm, said he still recommended the vaccine, but its benefits were over-reported

‘But we have over-promoted this 
vaccine. For certain age groups in some years its effectiveness has been
 severely limited relative to what has been previously reported.

‘That has had a very dampening effect
 on the development of new vaccines.’ And Douglas Fleming, of the Royal 
College of General Practitioners’ Influenza Monitoring Unit in  
Birmingham, said: ‘No vaccines are perfect. Last year’s flu vaccine was a
 bad match with the circulating strains. Its effectiveness varies from 
year to year and with different age groups.

‘Among the elderly it is widely 
recognised that its effectiveness decreases. Better vaccines are needed 
for this reason particularly. It has been over-hyped by many people.’

At present the flu jab is offered 
free to the over-65s, pregnant women and anyone with an underlying 
health condition such as asthma, diabetes or epilepsy.

The immunisation programme is  estimated to cost the taxpayer £115million a year.

The latest figures from the Health 
Protection Agency show that 61 per cent of the over-65s have been 
vaccinated this year, as well as 30 per cent of pregnant women and 37.5 
per cent of those with long-term conditions.

A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘There is no doubt that the flu programme saves lives.

‘Evidence on the effectiveness of the
 vaccine is reviewed by the Joint Committee of Vaccination and 
Immunisation and this year the committee undertook a detailed review of 
the flu vaccine programme.

‘We strongly encourage scientists and
 the vaccine industry in their efforts to develop new and more effective
 flu vaccine and do not agree that these efforts are being discouraged.

‘Each year thousands of people die after catching flu and we urge everyone that is in an at-risk group to get the vaccine.’

Professor Osterholm added: ‘We 
support using flu vaccine in all age groups. Even among the over-65s, 
although it is of limited benefit, it is still a benefit.’
