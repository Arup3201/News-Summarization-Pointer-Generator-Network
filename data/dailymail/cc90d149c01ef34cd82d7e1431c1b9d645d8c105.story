A girl of seven with Down’s Syndrome has been chosen from hundreds of hopefuls as the face of a major children’s clothing campaign.

The decision by Sainsbury’s to use Natty Goleniowska to advertise school uniforms is a step  forward in making children with the condition more accepted, say campaigners.

Natty, from Padstow, Cornwall, will star in the Back To School campaign online, in stores and in magazines later this summer.

'Big step forward': Natalia 'Natty' Goleniowska, seven, has Down's Syndrome and has won the star role in a new advertising campaign for Sainsbury's

Her mother Hayley Goleniowska, 43, a former language teacher, who runs campaign group Down’s Side Up, said: ‘We are delighted that so many people will now see that Natty is just a lovely, bright and cheerful little girl.

‘As a mum, I have worried about the fact that there are not that many images out there featuring children like her, so this is a big step forward.’

Two children a day are born with Down’s Syndrome in Britain, although around 1,000 babies are terminated a year, due to advances in prenatal screening, which mean the majority of cases are picked up earlier in pregnancy.

It is estimated that around 60,000 people with Down’s Syndrome are living in the UK.

Mrs Goleniowska, of Padstow, whose older daughter Mia is free of the condition, had no idea she was carrying a baby with Down’s until Natty, short for Natalia, was born.

‘For me, the realities of Down’s syndrome today are of the independence that is possible and the huge benefits that we all reap from being inclusive and accepting different ways of living. Most of all it is understanding what those with learning disabilities contribute huge amounts to their communities,’ she said.

‘Natalia is simply our daughter, a cake lover, swimming addict and annoying little sister.

'Our lived reality doesn’t even begin to overlap the stereotyped image that my ignorant subconscious created before, from all the outdated glimpses into the lives of adults with the condition when I was a child.’

James Brown, Sainsbury’s Non-Food Trading Director said: ‘We are delighted to work with Natty and are looking forward to seeing her in the Back to School campaign in August.’

A spokeswoman from the Down’s Syndrome Association, said last night:

‘There does seem to be a sea-change going on at the moment in attitudes towards children with Down’s Syndrome and this a very positive thing. Anyone looking at pictures of Natty can see she is just delightful.

‘In a way, it is great not to make a fuss of it because to most school children, seeing a child with Down’s Syndrome in school is now part of everyday life. The fact that children like Natty are being included in advertising is very powerful.’

Other stores have also used children with Down’s Syndrome in advertising in the past year. Marks and Spencer used six-year-old Seb White, of Bath, in a Christmas catalogue and Natty has modelled for JoJo Maman Bebe in the past.

Seb White’s mother Caroline, 40, who took matters into her own hands and complained to M&S that there were no children like her son in any of its adverts, said last night: ‘For me, It is crucial to have children with Down’s Syndrome in Back to School campaigns because it is inclusive. When it was our turn to start school, there were no pictures of kids like Seb there, and we were just as excited to buying his school uniform as anybody else.’
