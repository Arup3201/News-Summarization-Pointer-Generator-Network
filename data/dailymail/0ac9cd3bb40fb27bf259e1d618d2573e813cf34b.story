Killer: Carl Mills, 28, who was today found guilty of the murders of a whole family, who all died when a fire he started ripped through their home

A violent alcoholic who killed three 
generations of a family – including his own baby – in a jealous rage was
 jailed for at least 30 years yesterday.

Carl Mills set fire to a house, trapping his girlfriend Kayleigh Buckley, her daughter Kimberley and Miss Buckley’s mother Kim.

Mills, 28, started the blaze because he was convinced Miss Buckley, 17, had another man in her bedroom.

But the only people in the house were 
family celebrating six-month-old Kimberley being allowed home from 
hospital for the first time.

She was deaf and blind, having  been 
born 13 weeks premature weighing 1lb 9oz. Her twin, Angel, who weighed 
only 15oz, had died two days after being born.

Mills, who had been banned from the 
home in Coed Eva, Cwmbran, South Wales, after making repeated threats to
 kill Miss Buckley and the baby, set fire to a recycling bin in the 
porch.

The smoke and flames spread quickly 
and prosecutor Gregory Bull told Newport Crown Court: ‘The three victims
 didn’t have a chance.

‘They couldn’t get down the stairs because the fire was set deliberately by the front door.’

Neighbours saw Miss Buckley banging on
 the windows and screaming for help but they were beaten back by the 
flames as they tried in vain to save her, her 46-year-old mother and 
the baby.

Mills, who yawned in court as a statement by Miss Buckley’s 
family was read out, was jailed for life after being found guilty of 
three counts of murder.

Judge Wyn Williams ordered that Mills,
 whom he described as ‘despicable’, should serve a minimum  of 30 years,
 telling him: ‘There is  no saying whether you will ever  be released.

‘You must have known that once the 
fire had taken hold that there would be virtually no chance of escape.

'You condemned Kim and Kayleigh to an agonising death. You have shown no 
remorse.’

Callous: His own daughter Kimberley Buckley was only six-months-old when she died after a fire swept through the property

Mills, who was unemployed and had been living in a tent outside the house, had denied murder.

He claimed he was in a pub at the time the fire was started in September last year.

But a series of aggressive and abusive
 texts Mills had sent Miss Buckley the night before, threatening to 
torch the family home, were read to the jury, and he was seen outside 
the house displaying ‘a callous, almost casual disregard’ as the inferno
 took hold.

Mr Bull said: ‘Neighbours were shocked
 by how calm he appeared to be. He showed no emotion and did not attempt
 to rescue his daughter or the woman he claimed to love. It was the 
actions of a cold-hearted killer who knew exactly what he was doing.

‘He had carried out the threat he had made hours earlier.’

Calculated: The court heard Mills started the fire in the porchway of the three-bed house, blocking the exit

Home: The tent Mills had lived in in the front garden of the house he torched. He had also been banned from seeing his child Kimberley unsupervised

Mills met Miss Buckley on the internet when she was 15. He was living in Manchester and travelled to South Wales to meet her.

He deliberately set out to groom her 
and their relationship developed into a sexual one. But he became 
obsessively jealous of Miss Buckley, over whom he seemed to exercise a 
‘magnetic control’, the court was told.

She became pregnant with the twins, born in March last year.

Mr Bull said: ‘Kayleigh started acting
 as a mother. Mills didn’t want Kayleigh to spend more time with the 
baby. He wanted Kayleigh to be with him and him alone. He become 
convinced she was having an affair.’

This, he said, led to the tragedy.

Shameful: The murderer was motionless in the dock as he was found guilty and sat with his head bowed as the judge jailed him

The jury was told that Mills wouldn't leave Kayleigh (pictured) alone and was sleeping in a tent in front of the family home

In a
 statement to the court,  Mrs Buckley’s mother Gwyneth Swain, 64, said: 
‘The heart has been ripped out of our family by the senseless actions of
 Carl Mills. There’s a hole in my life that no one will ever fill.

‘I’m so lost without them and I cannot
 truly express this. Like her mum, Kayleigh always had a smile on her 
face, she loved her family and we all loved her.

‘Baby Kimberley battled so much. But the fire that night was a battle too far.’

Family and friends burst into applause as Mills was taken away to begin his sentence.

They released three white doves and 
balloons on the steps of the court in memory of the three victims.

In a 
statement afterwards, the family said: ‘Today we feel justice has been 
served.’

Underweight, shifty and with a diffident demeanour Carl Mills was about as far from appearing intimidating in court as possible.

His threatening texts promising violence and murder to teenager Kayleigh (together right) showed him to be a bully and a coward.

In court he appeared slightly built and pale-faced and above all eager to avoid eye contact with his murder trial jury.

Chronically soft-spoken he mumbled his way through his evidence and was frequently incomprehensible.

Despite electing to stand when he gave evidence Mills lent forward and bent his knees in such a way he almost appeared to be sitting.

As a result his face frequently fell below a small flat screen TV in the witness box, making it difficult for the jury to see him.

The combination of his stance and almost whispered evidence led his own defence barrister to berate him for failing to speak up.

'You are on trial for three counts of murder. This is your chance to give your story. Now please buck up,' Patrick Harrington QC told him in court.

In all Mills appeared a pathetic and forlorn figure, a stark contrast to the brutish language used in his chilling text messages.

In many ways, however, he also represents the embodiment of every parent’s worst nightmare.
