He had a week to think about it but Nick Clegg could still only muster faint praise for stay-at-home mothers yesterday.

He said parents who decided to stop work had made a ‘noble’ decision but claimed they had not been hammered by Coalition taxes.

The Deputy Prime Minister was speaking on his radio programme a week after he was ambushed on the show by full-time mother Laura Perrins, who said ministers viewed her choice as ‘worthless’.

And last night another stay-at-home mother Claire Paye, 41, criticised Mr Clegg’s latest statement.

The former banker from Reading said: ‘Describing being a mother as noble or admirable is so very condescending. Nobility has nothing to do with it.

‘Often parents do not want to go back to work but sometimes it is a necessary decision because the Government will not support them.’

Mother-of-two Mrs Perrins, who has lost her child benefit payments, had attacked the decision to restrict childcare tax breaks worth up to £1,200 a year per child to working mothers.

Last week she tore into Mr Clegg saying: ‘I’m just wondering why the Coalition is discriminating against mothers like me who care for their children at home. You probably think what I do is a worthless job.’

Yesterday Mr Clegg was presented with the results of an international study by the Organisation for Economic and Cooperation Development, showing single-earner families have paid more tax than others under the Coalition.

The Lib Dem leader floundered as he was presented with OECD figures on taxes paid by single-earner families

Presenter Nick Ferrari said Mrs 
Perrins, 32, had left him a message to say: ‘I would just ask him to 
look at the OECD report again and think about the impact that these 
policies are having on families up and down Britain.’

The
Lib Dem leader, whose wife Miriam is a high-powered lawyer, floundered 
as he refused to discuss the figures and said it was not his job to 
judge parents’ decisions to stay at home.

He
said: ‘I don’t want to get into all the number crunching on this. I 
don’t actually accept that a lot of the measures that we’ve taken are 
somehow penalising mums – or indeed dads – who take the totally 
admirable decision [to stay at home].

'I’m
also a parent, I know these are incredibly important decisions about 
how you juggle work and family … these very kind of noble decisions that
many, many parents have taken, to say no, for a few years or maybe 
permanently, they’re going to dedicate themselves to their children.’

The
OECD study found the average UK family with one working parent and two 
children lost 27.9 per cent of their wages in tax in 2012, compared with
26.2 per cent in 2009, before the Coalition was elected.

The international average is 26.1 per cent.
