A snorkeller saved his guide's life by grabbing the tail of a 12ft-long great white shark and pulling it off her leg as it attacked her.

Trevor Burns, 50, was awarded the Star 
of Courage today for his heroics in saving Elyse Frankcom off the coast 
of Rockingham, western Australia.

Miss Frankcom, then 19, was leading a dozen snorkellers, including Mr Burns, on a dolphin tour 
off a boat when the shark clamped her thigh and bottom in its jaws.

As the water filled with blood, Mr Burns grabbed the tail of the shark, which carried on shaking Miss Frankcom while trying to fend off her rescuer through violent thrashing.

'I just thought: "Get it off her",' the IT consultant from Brisbane said today as he received Australia's second highest award for civilian bravery.

'I knew she was going to be in trouble and she needed help.'

After several seconds with Mr Burns on his tail, the shark released Miss Frankcom, who had punched it on the nose and activated her 'shark shield' sensor, and swam away.

Her limp body began to sink until Mr Burns was able to find her in the bloody waters and pulled her back to the surface, where she regained consciousness.

The boat's passengers included a nurse and a paramedic, who treated Miss Frankcom before she was taken to hospital for surgery and more than 200 stitches to her leg wounds.

Now the pair and their families are close friends, with Mr Burns accompanying Miss Frankcom on her first dive back in the ocean eleven months after the October 2010 attack.

Since their shark ordeal, Trevor Burns and Elyse Frankcom have become close friends

A year after the attack, she had the words 'What doesn't kill me will only make me stronger' tattooed across the top of her back, with a dolphin, a shark fin and the initials 'TB' to commemorate her rescuer.

But Mr Burns told reporters today that he was not sure if he would repeat his heroics.

'I'd like to think I would. I'm reasonably
confident I would,' he said.

'But it's purely on the day. It's a 
decision you've got to make and you either go for it or you don't.'
