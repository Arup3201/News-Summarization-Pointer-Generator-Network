A woman who suffered from a rare condition which made her grow into a 6ft 11ins giant has died suddenly at the age of 34.

Tanya Angus, from Las Vegas, spent the last 12 years trying to find a cure for her acromegaly, which meant she couldn't stop growing.

Until the age of 21, Tanya was just 5ft 8ins tall and weighed 130lbs. She rode horses, went dancing and had a boyfriend.

Struggle: Miss Angus has died at the age of 34 after her heart failed due to her extreme size

But a tumour became wrapped around her pituitary gland, causing massive amounts of growth hormone to be released into her body.

Tanya,
 who became wheelchair-bound, had the most extreme form of acromegaly 
ever seen, growing to nearly 7ft tall, and more than 400lbs.

Ms Angus, who had been working as a 
supervisor at a Walmart in Michigan, was fired from her post when her condition worsened, and was dumped by her boyfriend when his parents 
questioned whether she was a man.

But
 she never gave up searching for a treatment to halt her incredible 
growth and hoped she could one day have a more normal life.

In
 August last year, it seemed like Tanya and her family had finally seen a
 breakthrough, when a blood test revealed that her growth hormone levels
 had fallen at last.

Tanya's
 mother Karen Strutynski said at the time: 'For the first time ever, 
Tanya's blood level for her disease is in the normal range.

'It gives us renewed hope and will give other people renewed hope.'

Sorrow: A message was posted on Tanya Angus's website that she had sadly passed away on January 14

The
 good news was short-lived. Tanya's Insulin-like Growth Factor levels, 
which had fallen from 3,000 at the worst of her condition to just 283, 
had started to creep back up into the 500's. The normal range for a 
healthy person is around 250.

It is thought the extreme pressure on her body, caused by 12 years of coping with her huge size,Â  caused her heart to fail.

Acromegaly, which affects 20,000 people in the U.S., is usually caused by a non-cancerous tumour on the pituitary gland.

Ms Angus had undergone radiation and surgery three times in an effort to have hers removed, but, as it is wrapped around her carotid artery, it has proved too difficult.

If left untreated, acromegaly can be life-threatening, as it causes organs such as the heart and lungs to grow along with height and weight.

Sufferers are at higher risk of developing diabetes and high blood pressure, while the pressure on their joints causes swelling and early onset of osteoarthritis.

A
 notice on Tanya's website, which has inspired and helped acromegaly 
sufferers around the world, reads simply: 'It is with deep sorrow that 
we announce the passing on of our beloved Tanya Angus at 12.25am on 
January 14, 2013, due to her heart and TIA. RIP dear one'

Transient
 Ischemic Attack (TIA) is a type of mini-stroke, caused when the blood 
flow to the brain stops for a period of time.

Tanya had suffered a 
number of TIAs in recent years.

Describing
 her acromegaly last year, Tanya said: 'Sometimes I feel really down 
about it but to me the most important thing is that I have to tell 
people about it.

'I read 
emails that people send in saying: ''You're my inspiration,'' or, ''You 
are so strong.''

'If I am helping other people, I feel I can do 
anything.'

Tanya, whose 
condition caused her to spend many hours sleeping, found her outlet 
through her website, which helped her gain friends around the world.

Last
 year, she was able to meet some of them for the first time at an 
Acromegaly Conference in Las Vegas, where fellow sufferers told Tanya 
how hearing her story had caused them to seek early treatment, and 
possibly saved their lives.

During
 the last 12 years, Tanya underwent three operations to attempt to 
remove her tumour, but several different surgeons were unable to reach 
part of the growth, as it was wrapped around her inner carotid artery.

Her heart, lungs and the joints of her limbs continued to grow as she gained weight and height, causing huge strain on her body.

Her
 mother Karen and stepfather Allan continued to search for new ways of 
tackling her condition, and last year doctors finally agreed to double 
the dose of Tanya's growth inhibitor medication, which was administered 
by painful injections into her spine.

The treatment seemed to finally be
 working, until the sad news in October that her growth hormone levels 
were rising again.

Tanya, 
talking in 2009 about the slow onset of her growth said: 'I couldn't 
understand why, as I wasn't eating more. What was strange was that my 
feet seemed to grow as well. My face also started to swell and was 
changing.

'I felt unhappy 
with my appearance and spent a fortune on make-up. My figure also 
started to change and become more manly and my voice became deeper.'

The
 34-year-old, who loved jewellery and enjoyed regular swimming sessions 
which helped her body feel weightless, continued to remain hopeful 
throughout her life.

'Without hope you don't have anything,' she is quoted as saying. 'I hope they can stop me growing one day.'
