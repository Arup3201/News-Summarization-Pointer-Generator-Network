A South African couple's visit to New Zealand was to be the trip of a lifetime - a seaside hotel, a pier to stroll along and picturesque gardens to wander through.

All this to enjoy while they were attending matches in which the South African team were bidding to defend the trophy at the Rugby World Cup.

But there was just one little hiccup - Michael and Sunette Adendorff couldn't find the bayside Majestic Hotel - or even the street in the Eastbourne suburb of Wellington that it was supposed to be located in.

Wrong one: The couple booked into this hotel in Eastbourne, East Sussex, when they actually wanted to stay in one in Eastbourne, New Zealand

On the other side of the world: Eastbourne in Wellington, New Zealand

Convinced they had lost their way, or there was something wrong with the GPS system in their rental car, they wandered into a shop to ask for directions.

And it wasn't long before the truth dawned on them.

The hotel they had booked into online was the Majestic in Eastbourne, UK, not a Majestic in Eastbourne, Wellington.

'I booked into the right hotel, just in the wrong country,' Mr Adendorff said.

'The Kiwis took the p*** out of us 
because of our silly mistake but it was very nice and they were very 
friendly,' he told the Dominion newspaper.

Keen
rugby fans, the couple had decided to fly to New Zealand to watch their
team play in the world cup and had set about finding a hotel in 
Wellington.

Eastbourne in East Sussex has been a popular resort for tourists since the early 19th century.

Its population is 98,000, with roughly 25 per cent of those in the over 60s bracket - well above the national average.

It is thought that they retire there because of its 'quiet charm and elegance.'

The town is focused on tourism, with more than four miles of shingle beaches.

It also has a pier built in 1865 which houses an amusement arcade and nightclub.

Temperatures in the town hit an average high of 20.5c in August.

The town also hosts an annual airshow named Airbourne and a ladies tennis tournament prior to Wimbledon.

Eastbourne, New Zealand, is a small suburb of Lower Hutt city, located on the southern tip of the North Island.

It has a population of around 4,600.

The town has a regular selection of shops, takeaways, restaurants and pubs to cater for its residents.

For tourists, the location is a popular wind and kitesurfing location due to its frequently windy weather, while there are are also sheltered swimming beaches.

Those more interested in keeping their feet on dry land can enjoy coastal walks among red northern rata trees.

There are also three lighthouses at the heads of the coast, which prove popular with tourists visiting the town at weekends.

They liked the website pictures of what they thought was the Majestic in Eastbourne, Wellington, but when they keyed in the booking, encouraged by the enticing description of the surroundings, they didn't realise they were looking at a hotel 12,000 miles away on England's south coast.

In fact the British hotel is called the Bay Majestic, promoting splendid views directly opposite the beach 'within a few minutes' walk of the bustling pier and picturesque Redoubt Gardens, and lying close to the heart of the town.'

Not realising the Majestic wasn't in Eastbourne, Wellington, the couple paid for their accommodation in advance for two nights.

They were a little puzzled why the payment was in pounds, but went ahead with the booking.

Unable to find Royal Parade when they arrived in Wellington and after driving around in circles the Adendorffs went into a chemist's shop in the Eastbourne suburb to ask directions.

Employee Linda Burke said that when they asked where the Majestic Hotel was she told them: 'Oh no, there's no hotel here.'

When she looked at the booking documents she broke the news: 'That's in the UK - that's in England.'

Miss Burke told the paper that she wasn't about to let them go without accommodation, so she offered to put them up in her own house for the night.

She also took them out on the town for beers and dinner at a pub, where the locals gave them some good-natured ribbing.

With their lost down-payment on the British hotel, the couple ended up about Â£200 out of pocket but they said Miss Burke's hospitality more than made up for the mix-up.

The couple have moved to the town of Picton for a few nights but will be back in Wellington next week to stay at the West Plaza Hotel - and they've double-checked that it is in the New Zealand capital and is not some far-away hotel on the English coast.
