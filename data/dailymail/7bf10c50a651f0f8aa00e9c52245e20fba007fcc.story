Suspect: Lonnie Leroy Tate, 52, is accused of bashing in the windows of his neighbor's house and pouring gasoline into the residence before setting it ablaze

A man who is believed to be mentally ill went berserk and smashed up his neighbor's home in Buckley, Washington, before setting it ablaze on Saturday, according to police.

The suspect, identified as 52-year-old Lonnie Leroy Tate, turned himself in to police custody about three hours later and was then taken to a local hospital.

The incident started at around 5:30pm when Tate marched over to a neighbor's home in the 6800 block of 245th Avenue East and claimed that she owed him money, police said.

The victim, however, insisted that she had had no prior dealings with Tate.

Following a verbal argument, the 52-year-old man turned violent, grabbed a baseball bat and bashed in the windows in the home, KOMONews.com reported.

As the terrified neighbor fled the house through the back door, Tate poured gasoline into the residence and set it on fire, said Detective Lynelle Anderson of the Pierce County Sheriff's Office. The blaze was later extinguished by East Pierce firefighters.

Manhunt: Police used a K-9 dog to scour the woods in search of Tate, but failed to find him

Local residents told KIRO-TV that prior to the incident, they heard Tate arguing with a woman – possibly a girlfriend - in his nearby home.

Officers who arrived on the scene after receiving a report about an agitated man who was possibly intoxicated or mentally ill Tasered Tate twice in an attempt to subdue him, but it had no effect on him.

The 52-year-old fled on foot into the woods, setting off a manhunt involving a K-9 unit which came up empty. Deputies did, however, find the bat used in the incident. 

At around 8:15pm, Tate turned himself in and was taken to Good Samaritan Hospital in satisfactory condition to be treated for unspecified injuries.

On Saturday night, a miscommunication with dispatch led police to believe that Tate had escaped from the hospital, and it was not until Sunday afternoon that authorities discovered that the man was still in his room, The News Tribune reported.

Anderson said that Tate has a history of prior arrests for drug possession and vandalism, but now he may face felony charges.
