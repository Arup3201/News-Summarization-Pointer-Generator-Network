This was the moment a hapless thief was caught trying to steal a florist's flower cart when he tried to make his escape - using a getaway horse.

George Smith stunned onlookers when he approached the market stall in broad daylight and hitched his chestnut mare to the cart full of flowers.

He then dragged the wheeled cart through the car park of a supermarket and over speed bumps before police finally caught up with him.

Caught in the act: Police escort George Smith after he used his horse to steal a flower cart

Smith, 36, from Croydon in south London, was captured on camera making his bizarre getaway from the scene of the crime in neighbouring Carshalton, Surrey.

The cart belonged to florist Christopher Tucker. The trade said his livelihood would have been lost had he not had the cart returned to him, a court was told.

Smith was ordered to pay £210 after he pleaded guilty to one count of theft when he appeared at Croydon Magistrates’ Court.

Prosecuting, Miss Elias told the court that despite the £2,500 cart being pulled over speed bumps, it was undamaged.

She added: 'The cart had been in the family for 44 years.

'If the owner had lost it he said he would have lost everything, and had no way to make a living.'

Defending Smith, Miss McClaren told 
the court he had recently split from his wife and was struggling to find
work, carrying out odd jobs.

She said: 'On this day the reason he took the cart was he thought he could make something from it - thought he could use it. He has just separated from his wife, is living with his parents and is trying to get back on his feet.

'Unfortunately on this occasion he was silly enough to go and take this cart.'

She said he was remorseful for what he had done. Delivering the verdict magistrates ordered Smith to pay a £110 fine, £85 in court costs and a £15 victim surcharge.

Smith denied four charges of animal cruelty - forcing a horse to pull an unreasonable load, beating a horse, fitting an inappropriate harness and failing to provide parasite control.

He will stand trial on these counts at Croydon Magistrates’ Court on November 2.
