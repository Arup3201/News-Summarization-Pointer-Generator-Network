Arsene Wenger is considering turning to Alexis Sanchez to solve Arsenal's striker crisis again at Southampton on New Year's Day.

As reported by Sportsmail on Wednesday, the Gunners manager has a selection dilemma up front with Olivier Giroud suspended and Danny Welbeck doubtful with a thigh problem.

Welbeck continued to have treatment on Wednesday and looks set to miss the trip to St Mary's.

The Chilean, pictured in training on New Year's Eve, has been in fine form for the Gunners since his arrival

Out-of-favour Lukas Podolski is nursing a slight groin issue, which if aggravated could have consequences for his proposed loan switch to Inter Milan.

Yaya Sanogo is suffering from a hamstring problem, though Theo Walcott is fit again but has only just returned from knee and groin issues that has resulted in the forward not starting a game for close to 12 months.

And that has seen Wenger consider utilising summer signing Sanchez as his side's centre forward against the Saints on New Year's Day.

Arsenal are currently struggling with injuries and suspensions in their front line ahead of New Year's Day

Joel Campbell may play a part against Southampton, but Sanchez is likely to be preferred in the centre

Wenger will make a late decision on his team selection on Thursday as he awaits news on his injured players.

Joel Campbell is also being considered but the Chilean looks to be favourite to fill the striker void.

Meanwhile, the Gunners are set to move for Atletico Madrid midfielder Mario Suarez on loan next month.

Wenger is on the look out for a holding central midfielder and the 27-year-old is emerging as an option for the Gunners.

Suarez has fallen behind Gabi, Yiago, Raul Garcia and Saul Niguez in the midfield pecking order and could be available on loan until the end of the season.

Wenger still has designs on signing Morgan Schneiderlin or William Carvalho for the defensive midfield role in the summer, but views Suarez as a suitable stop-gap until then.
