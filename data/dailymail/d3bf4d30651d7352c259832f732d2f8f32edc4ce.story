Those who love them praise their 'mild nutty taste' and 'crunch' but for most diners the thought eating insects might prove to be one culinary step too far. 

Adventurous visitors at a Belgian food fair were treated to unusual offerings such as buffalo worm burgers, pan-fried crickets and bugs served with chocolate sauce.

The EAT! Brussels food event showcased meals made with the creepy critters, highlighting companies  who have embarked on food ventures with buffalo worms, house crickets and mealworms.

One such entrepreneur is Belgian cricket breeder Little Food, who supplies the critters to gourmet restaurants, praising their 'mild nutty taste' and 'crunch'. 

The company suggest serving the insects with soy sauce and mushrooms, or on chocolate.

Ms Nicky Deneef, from Waterloo, was unfazed by the taste as the company promoted their product at the event.

'It's okay, it's really good in fact,' she said after popping one of the creatures in her mouth.

Little Food says the cricket contains three times as much protein as beef, along with a wide range of vitamins, minerals and fatty acids.

On top of health benefits, insects are seen as a solution to meet the demands of food supply and are viewed as a more environmentally-friendly method of food production.

Wriggly additions: Mealworms getting ready to be processed into sauces and spreads at Green Kow 

Insect spreads on offer include savoury carrot, or tomato as well as sweet chocolate

This spurred Damien Huysmans to found Green Kow, which prides itself on being the first in Europe to offer products containing mealworms to be distributed in regular stores.

A range of mealworm-based spreads are on offer - from savoury carrot or tomato to sweet chocolate. Huysmans said he wanted to be a part of the buzz surrounding insect food.

Mr Huysmans said to Reuters: 'We have heard a lot of people talking about insects as the food of the future, because it's great for the environment, from a nutritional point of view and for the taste as well it's got something to bring at a gastronomical level. 

'And we quite simply said to ourselves, 'Ok, if it's that great, we'll start now then. We'll get going right away,'' he said. 

Bugs on chocolate: Insect-based food products are now creeping into Belgian kitchens

Belgian supermarket Delhaize started stocking Green Kow's Green Bugs in September

Belgian supermarket Delhaize started stocking their product Green Bugs in September, expanding Green Kow's sale of mealworms beyond organic and natural food stores.

Not everyone, however, was convinced by the prospect of stocking their fridges with bugs.

'I look at them, but I'm afraid of the texture of the product. 

It's not the flavor. I'm not afraid of the taste of the product, but I'm afraid of the texture of the product,' shopper Renee-Claude Charton said in the video.

Students at a Brussels-based university have taken more warmly to insects after the canteen introduced a buffalo worm burger in October, becoming the first commercial kitchen in Belgium to serve the product. 

Apprehensive: Some diners remain unconvinced, saying that they are afraid of the texture of the products

The burger, produced by Belgian food producer Damhert, was so successful at Brussels' Vrije Universiteit (VUB)'s cafeteria that worm nuggets were on offer two weeks later.

Gert Venken, a political science student at the university, was happy to tuck in to both the nuggets and the burger.

'People find that perhaps gross, but it's as gross to eat animals' livers. Some people eat all the parts of pigs and cows. 

Why would this then be gross? I think it's all edible and has been tested. For me, it's not gross. It doesn't scare me,' he said.

Insects will remain on the university's menu for the foreseeable future, with the cafeteria saying it planned to serve them every two to three weeks.

Belgium was one of the first European countries to issue national guidelines concerning the sale of insects as food in 2013.
