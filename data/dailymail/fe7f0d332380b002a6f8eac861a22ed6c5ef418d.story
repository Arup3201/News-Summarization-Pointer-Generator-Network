The price of an ordinary three-bedroom semi will hit £330,000 by 2020, economists have predicted.

An average semi-detached home rocket by almost £90,000 in just six years, while the same in London will be an eye-watering £565,000, a new report predicts.

The increase is a significant leap from the current figure of £242,000 for a three-bed home, and will add to fears of Britain being caught in the grip of an 'overheating' housing market.

The stark property predictions come in the latest UK Economic Outlook report by financial services firm PwC.

It forecasts an eight per cent rise in house prices this year, 5.5 per cent in 2015 and incrementally smaller rises until the final figure of £328,000 is expected to come in 2020.

Concerns surrounding soaring property prices - which make housing increasingly unaffordable for the young - come as the Bank of England considers ending the historically low interest rates in the UK which has helped foster the market. 

William Zimmern, a PwC senior economist said: 'House prices across the UK are accelerating. We do, however, expect the pace to moderate, slowing to around 3.5 per cent between 2016 and 2020.

'We don't believe the housing market is overheating at a national level yet, although evidence of a bubble in London is stronger.'

Mr Zimmern raised the prospect of the Bank of England increasing interest rates eightfold when the shift does eventually come, to put a dampener on the housing market.

He said: 'They could rise to around four per cent, but in the longer term, measures to boost housing supply more directly should be the priority.'

The predictions came as a major report gave fresh evidence of the property market continuing to surge, with house prices up 8.8 per cent year-on-year.

The figure is the strongest annual uplift since 2007 as consumer confidence continues to rise, Halifax has reported.

The increase took the average UK house price to £183,462, although on a month-on-month basis prices slipped back by 0.6 per cent, marking the fourth monthly price fall seen since last December.

The year-on-year uplift in property values has accelerated on an 8.7 per cent annual increase recorded in May and marks the biggest year-on-year jump seen since October 2007, the figures show. 

A year ago, in June 2013, house prices were increasing annually at less than half the pace they are now, by 3.7 per cent.

The latest 0.6 per cent monthly drop in property values marks a large swing backwards from a month-on-month increase of 4 per cent recorded in May.

Halifax said month-on-month price changes can often be 'volatile' and its quarter-on-quarter measure of price fluctuations is a more reliable indicator of what is happening in the market.

This quarterly measure revealed that the underlying direction for house prices is still pointing upwards.

Property values between April and June this year were 2.3 per cent higher than they were between January and March. 

Stephen Noakes, mortgages director at Halifax, said: 'Housing demand continues to be supported by an economic recovery that is gathering pace, with employment levels growing and rising consumer confidence, although real earnings growth remains sluggish.'
