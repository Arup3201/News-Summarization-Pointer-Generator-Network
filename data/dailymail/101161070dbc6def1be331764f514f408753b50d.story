The Cronulla Sharks have pulled of one of the greatest comebacks in the club's 47-year history after a hellish week that claimed one of their star players.

The embattled club ended their week with a win against the premiers coming from 24-0 with only half an hour on the clock to triumph over the Sydney Roosters 30-28 in the boilover of the season at Sydney's Allianz Stadium on Saturday.

It came a week after State of Origin player Todd Carney was sensationally sacked from the club when a photo of him engaged in lewd behaviour in a bathroom at Northies nightclub in Cronulla emerged on social media on June 28.

The Cronulla Sharks have pulled off one of the greatest comebacks in rugby league at Sydney's Allianz Stadium

Just after half-time, they came from 24 points down to win 30-28 against premiers, the Sydney Roosters

The next day Sharks chief executive officer Steve Noyce announced they had ripped up Carney's $3-million contract with the club.

Closely following Carney's departure was Sharks coach Peter Sharp who resigned two days later.

But what makes the win even more miraculous is that it comes nine days after they also beat out the Broncos coming from 22 points down just after half-time to triumph 24-22 in 33 minutes.

Two days after the scandal broke, Carney spoke out about the shocking photo, explaining he did not know it was 'out there' and hoped it did not end his football career.

'It’s just disappointing for something that I didn't know was out there, something that’s surfaced like this,' he told Nine News.

The disgraced NRL star explained he 'felt sick' when he found out the photo, which he said was just a 'prank', was being shared across the internet.

'To receive the message on Saturday night, it’s just gut-wrenching, it made me feel sick straight away,' he said on the Monday following the photo's appearance.

Carney revealed he felt 'betrayed' by his club after he asked for the chance to talk to his teammates and the board, but was sacked before being given the opportunity to explain.

After these heavy blows to the club, it seemed unlikely things would look up for the bottom-placed Sharks. During Saturday's game, Sportsbet was paying $101 at half-time for a Cronulla win.

But even coachless and without their star player, halfback Jeff Robson was able to pull off some match-winning magic in the last three minutes before full-time, scoring a try, and with a conversion from fullback Michael Gordon they left the Roosters shell-shocked.

'I saw some odds in the paper. What were we - 50 to one or something? It was ridiculous. No one gave us a hope,' stand-in Sharks captain Wade Graham said after the win.

'The funny thing about rugby league players is that most of them have a little bit of attitude and, if you write them off, they like to step up to the mark and say I told you so.

'It was just a super effort from the boys.'

Graham said the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority saga that has plagued the club for a season and a half had steeled the Sharks.

'Over the last 18 months, we've gotten pretty good at putting distractions to the side and just focusing on footy and last week was no different,' he said.

'We got together on Monday, we had our say [about Carney's sacking] and by Tuesday morning it was over. We put it to bed.'

ASADA has been investigating the Sharks over the banned use of injections, creams and tablets in issue in 2001 over an 11-week supplements program.

Since the investigation, the Sharks have been left desperate to find major sponsors as a result of continual bad press over the drug probe.

Cronulla are currently at the bottom of the NRL ladder, with a drug investigation also hanging over their heads
