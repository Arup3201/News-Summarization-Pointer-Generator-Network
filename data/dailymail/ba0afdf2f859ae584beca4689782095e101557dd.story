At long last, it may actually happen. Boxing’s first $200million spectacular. The mega-fight we’ve all been waiting for.

The most reliable hint thus far that Floyd Mayeather and Manny Pacquiao will finally get it on began rustling around the American rumour mill as the PacMan flew into Los Angeles from Manila in the early hours of Monday morning, London time.

Book the date, at least provisionally: September 13 this year. The place: The MGM Grand Garden, Las Vegas.

Kings of the ring: Mayweather versus Pacquiao has been pencilled in for September 13 in Las Vegas

We’ve heard it all before but this time the word comes from close to Mayweather’s Money Team.

The
 same YouTube source which revealed that Mayweather would fight Robert 
Guerrero and Canelo Alvarez months before the official announcements of 
those bouts last year is claiming now that the biggest one of all is a
 done deal.

Mayweather keeps
 his cards closer to his chest than a world poker champion. He continues
 to play games by asking his Twitter followers to vote on who should be 
his next opponent.

However, 
his date with Britain's Amir Khan is expected to be confirmed any day. 
It has been in the works since October, as revealed by Sportsmail.

Not
 that it would be reasonable to expect him to disclose his plans for 
September before that fight, which is earmarked for the same Vegas venue
 on May 3.

Pacquiao also has
 a hurdle of his own to overcome at the MGM, on April 5, if the 
Mayweather bonanza is to have any chance of becoming reality.

He is back
 in master-trainer Freddie Roach’s Wild Card gym in LA preparing to 
avenge the miscarriage of judging which gifted Tim Bradley a split 
decision victory over him 20 months ago.

If
 Khan or Bradley spring a major upset, it would derail the Money train 
which is seemingly en route now to the biggest pay-night in ring 
history.

But with the casino
 odds heavily against either of them losing this spring, Mayweather and 
Pacquiao appear to be manoeuvring towards an autumn showdown which has 
been the best part of a decade in the making.

Pacquiao
 began clearing the decks by agreeing to Mayweather’s demands for 
Olympic blood-standard drugs testing as well as the lion’s share of the 
purse.

When his offer to 
accept just 40 per cent of the loot was followed by Mayweather’s 
insistence that he cut his promoter, Bob Arum, out of the deal, Pacquiao
 upped the moral ante.

In 
keeping with a proposition put in this column a few weeks in the wake of
 the typhoon disaster in the Philippines, his home land in which he is 
eyeing a run for the presidency, Pacquiao challenged Mayweather to fight
 him entirely for charity.

The
 silence which has greeted that proposal thus far suggests that 
Mayweather may indeed be considering a negotiation which could include a
 slice of the huge proceeds going to good causes in America as well as 
the Philippines. 

Another 
temptation for Mayweather to risk his cherished unbeaten record in a bid
 to seal his legacy of greatness – as well as bank an absolute fortune -
 has come with a perception in the US that Pacquiao is in decline.

Revenge mission: Pacquiao is first set for a rematch in April with Tim Bradley (left), who beat him 20 months ago

1)    Floyd Mayweather

2)    Manny Pacquiao

3)    Andre Ward

4)    Timothy Bradley

5)    Wladimir Klitschko

6)    Guillermo Rigondeaux

7)    Adonis Stevenson

8)    Sergio Martinez

9)    Juan Manuel Marquez

10)   Carl Froch

The
 controversial defeat by Bradley was followed by a shocking, one-punch 
KO by Pacquiao’s arch-rival Juan Manuel Marquez, whom Mayweather had 
beaten with ease.

Although 
Pacquiao came back to out-class a tough young Brandon Rios, he failed to
 finish the job with the knock-out which used to be his trademark.

Even
 if Pacquiao looks back to his best in the Bradley re-match, the dye 
may already be cast by then for September. Albeit in private.

As
 recently as two years ago Mayweather-Pacquiao would have been 
universally recognised as a duel between the two greatest 
pound-for-pound fighters in the world.

That
 may well be the case by the time they do meet. Mayweather still reigns 
supreme and in my view Pacquiao is back up there, just one place below 
him.

But even if Pacquiao is less than awesome against Bradley, a clash with Mayweather would still be huge box office.

Better late than never.

Top
 of the bill in Cardiff but over-shadowed by Anthony Joshua’s second 
round starching of Dorian Darch, his fourth professional fall-guy, the 
hottest Welsh prospect since Joe Calzaghe polished his credentials as a 
coming world title contender.

Lee
 Selby’s sixth round stoppage of boxing bin-man Rendall Munroe, himself a
 former world title challenger, added the European featherweight title 
to his British and Commonwealth belt.

Also the WBC International champion, Selby is closing in on world champion Jhonny Gonzalez.

Olympic
 heavyweight champion Joshua is as aware as anyone that he needs to step
 up in class now. To that end he is keeping commendably busy and seeking
 a tougher opponent in Glasgow on March 1.

The atmospheric mystique of prize-fighting has long held a fascination for artists, be they of the brush, the pen or the lens.

A
 book published this week comes very much in the tradition of noble 
art-work as established by such authors and painters as Damon Runyon, 
Budd Schulberg and Norman Rockwell.

In
 The Aura Of Boxing the hard old game is seen through the oblique 
camera of Max Kandhola, principal lecturer at the esteemed photography 
degree course at Nottingham Trent University.

Most memorable moment: Julius Francis (right) was knocked out in round two by Mike Tyson in 2000

Kandhola deliberately eschews the glitz and glamour of the big fights in favour of the tough grind of the gym.

His
 three prime subjects are not famed world champions but Julius Francis, 
the British heavyweight most remembered for being knocked out by Mike 
Tyson, Rob McCracken, who is enjoying greater success as the head 
trainer of Carl Froch and the GB Olympic team than he did in the ring, 
and Howard Clarke, who lost all but one of the 70 fights which followed a
 failed challenge for the IBF light-middleweight title on his one big 
night in the limelight at New York’s Madison Square Garden.

These
 are 120 fine-art photographs which it took Kandhola more than a decade 
to compile, many of them extreme close-ups of hard men and the raw 
paraphernalia of their severe work-place.

The corner man: Rob McCracken (left), has enjoyed success as a trainer to the likes of Carl Froch

Ironically it is the diffused, soft-focus shots which transmit most hauntingly the grimy reality of the prize-fighter’s life.

Publication is accompanied by exhibitions of these pictures in Nottingham and London.

The Aura Of Boxing, Max Kandhola, Dewi Lewis Publishing, £30/£45 hardback. Exhibitions: Now to April 21 New Art Exchange Nottingham, March 6-30 Rich Mix London – admissions is free.
