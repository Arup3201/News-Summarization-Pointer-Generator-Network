A pair of unmistakable glasses which belonged to bespectacled funnyman Benny Hill have emerged for sale more than 20 years after his death.

The wire-rimmed specs were worn by the slapstick comic in a 1973 sketch called The Deputy in which he played a bungling Wild West sheriff.

Hill had eye-holes drilled in the thick lenses - because contrary to popular belief there was nothing wrong with his sight.

Making a spectacle of himself: The wire-rimmed glasses that TV funnyman Benny Hill wore in The Deputy sketch for his hugely popular TV show are set to go under the hammer at C&T Auctions in Rochester, Kent

He became famous for his unique style of rude and raunchy comedy that often included chasing scantily clad women.

His TV series The Benny Hill Show was such a hit that it ran for almost four decades and made him a household name.

The glasses are the last item to be sold from a private collection of memorabilia assembled by a fan following Benny Hill's death in 1992.

Experts have tipped them to fetch £600 when they go under the hammer at C&T Auctions in Rochester, Kent.

The glasses are being sold with letters of provenance from Benny Hill fan club Benny's Place and Frances Bolwell, a costume designer who worked on The Benny Hill Show.

Glen Chapman, a specialist in TV memorabilia at C&T Auctions, said: 'Benny Hill is a TV legend and there is nothing more recognisable than his round glasses.

Double vision: The specs, pictured with auction tag, were worn in a 1973 edition of the comic's show where he played a Wild West sheriff. Hill had two holes drilled in the lenses as he couldn't see through the thick glass

Comic legend: Benny Hill was a fixture of TV schedules in the 1980s with his show's mixture of slapstick, silent comedy and sketches, often featuring him being chased by scantily-clad women, attracting millions of viewers

'These ones are like the bottoms of milk bottles, but Benny Hill's eyesight was fine so he had holes drilled into the lenses so he could see.

'They come from a scene called The Deputy that came out in 1973 in which Benny played a dopey sheriff in the American Wild West.

'These glasses are being sold by a vendor who bought a large collection of Benny Hill memorabilia in the early 1990s.

Specs for sale: Experts say the prop glasses, pictured with letter of authenticity, could fetch £600 when they go up for auction, with fans of classic comedy thought to be keen to snap up their very own piece of TV history

'Over the years he has sold all of the collection apart from this one pair of glasses.

'They come with letters of authenticity from Frances Bolwell, who designed costumes for the Benny Hill Show, and a Benny Hill fan club called Benny's Place.

'The sale will appeal more to an older audience who remember Benny Hill as the comedy genius he was.'
