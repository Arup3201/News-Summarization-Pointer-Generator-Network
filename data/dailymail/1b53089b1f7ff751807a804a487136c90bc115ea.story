The two-year-old who tragically died after a 30-metre gum tree fell on his home when wild thunderstorms swept through Melbourne has been identified.

Eli Marnock was asleep in his bedroom at The Patch in the Dandenong Ranges, east of Melbourne, just after 11pm when the tree - which had been reported as unsafe by the toddler's grandfather to the council - crushed the home, the Herald Sun reported

Emergency services rushed to the scene but were unable to save Eli who tragically died in his cot.

Seven family members were in the home at the time, including Eli's five-year-old sister Nicola, who was watching television when she sustained injuries to her leg chest and face.

Nicola was rushed to the Royal Children's Hospital and is now in a stable condition.

Neighbours have expressed their frustration at the Yarra Ranges Council as they had not acted on earlier complaints to remove the tree that fell.

One neighbour saying Eli’s grandfather, John Surridge, had recently made multiple requests to the council to check trees on the property.

Geoff Davis, Ambulance Victoria's acting Group Manager, says the large tree fell causing severe structural damage to the home. 

‘Two Urban Search And Rescue trained paramedics crawled under the tree to find the young boy and unfortunately he had died,’ Mr Davis said in a statement. 

The tragedy was one of three storm related incidents involving falling trees as winds during the Saturday storm howled at up to 130 kilometres per hour.

Ambulance Victoria reported  a 50-year-old woman in South Yarra and a 40-year-old man from The Basin also sustained minor leg injuries during the storm. 

Emergency services were inundated with almost 1,300 call outs for assistance between 8pm and 2am. 

The falling tree caused major structural damage to the home, injuring five-year-old Nicola and killing two-year-old, Eli 

The Victorian State Emergency Service says it received nearly 1,300 call-outs across the state after the wild storm hit
