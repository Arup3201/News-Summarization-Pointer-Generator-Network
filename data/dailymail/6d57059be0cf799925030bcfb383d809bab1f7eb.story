A harrowing video of a furious - and fatal - gun battle between police and a now-dead bank robber  that inevitably conjures images of the movie Heat has been released to the public by authorities in a southeastern Florida town.

Killed in the shootout was Calvin Wallace, 52, who police said had robbed a SunTrust Bank on Federal Highway in Boynton Beach a short time before 
the shootout that involved a slew of gun-toting, bullet-proof-vest-wearing police officers - one carrying what appears to be an assault rifle.

Swapping Lead: In this frame from the harrowing video, a Boynton Beach police officer unleashes a fusillade of bullets that the viewer can see puncturing the Lincoln Town car that was, moments before, driven by the robber

Killed: Calvin Wallace, 52, of Boynton Beach, reportedly robbed a SunTrust Bank in town only a short time before the fateful gun battle with police

Wallace, also of Boynton Beach, was trying to make a furious getaway from the bank and had 
reportedly ignored repeated orders to pull over and exit his vehicle.

Viewers watch with bated breath as Wallace, behind the wheel of a red Lincoln Town car, at first speeds away furiously from several police vehicles.

The dashboard cam of one of those police cars caught the entire incident on the now-released video.

Moments later, Wallace crashes his 
town car into another vehicle near Northeast Ninth and Railroad avenues,
and then unsuccessfully tries to open his door, which, by then, was 
jammed against the other vehicle involved in the accident.

Meanwhile,
officers surround the town car with 
guns drawn, as video viewers watch their bullets ping off of its frame.

Shades of Heat: Like in the movie, which portrays a furious - and very public - gun battle between police and a bank robber, Wallace reportedly fired first at police

In the iconic Michael Mann movie, Robert DeNiro plays a gun-toting bank robber and Al Pacino a gun-toting lawman

Fast and Furious: In this initial frame from the video, shot from a police vehicle's dashcam, Wallace flees in a red Lincoln Town car from pursuing police

Fateful Turn: In a wild bid to escape, Wallace makes a left-hand turn near Northeast Ninth and Railroad avenues in Boynton Beach

Crash: After making the left-hand turn, Wallace's vehicle plows into another car, giving officers a chance to catch up with the alleged bandit.

Gasp: Video viewers can see bullets ricocheting off the red Town car as Wallace tries desperately to open his door

Take Cover: In this frame, one officer grabs the bullet-proof vest of another, imploring his brother policeman to take cover from the bullets Wallace pumped out of his car and toward them

The Palm Beach Post
reports that the Boynton Beach Police officers involved in the 
shooting, Eric Reynolds and Christopher Munro, were cleared Thursday by 
Palm Beach County Chief Assistant State Attorney Paul Zachs.

Charges will not be filed against the two, according to a city police spokesman.

The
two officers, who both have not had any disciplinary actions against 
them, returned Wallace's intial bursts of gunfire, killing him.

Reynolds was taken to a local hospital after a gunshot wound to his foot.
