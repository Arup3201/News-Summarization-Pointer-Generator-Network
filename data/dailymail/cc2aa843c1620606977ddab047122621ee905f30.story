When Princess Diana's death was announced nearly 20 years ago, a tidal wave of emotion swept over Britain with an intensity that took many aback.

Mourners arrived in London in their thousands, leaving a mountain of floral tributes at the gates of the Royal Palaces and openly weeping in a rare collective moment of national grieving.

But as crowds thronged the Mall, threatening to storm the palace if the Queen failed to fly the flag at half-mast, little has ever really been known about what was going on behind the closed castle doors of Balmoral, the royal estate in Scotland where the Queen shut herself away with her two grandsons as the hysteria around them intensified. 

Now, nearly two decades on, a letter written by the Duke of Edinburgh has given an insight into the frustration the Royal Family felt at the way they were portrayed in the 'nightmare' days following Diana's death.

The letter, which was sent by Prince Philip to his niece Princess Margarita of Baden just five days after the Paris car crash, reveals how the delirium surrounding Diana's death made it harder to protect and comfort her two grieving sons, Prince William and Prince Harry.  

Presented on Balmoral Castle headed note paper, the part-written, part-typed letters also expresses the Duke's heartbreak at perceptions that the family were not publicly mourning.

Signing it off 'With much love Philip', he also uses reacts to criticism levelled at the Queen for taking the princes to church on the day Diana's death was announced, in an apparent show of the Royal Family's 'business-as-usual' attitude.

According to the Daily Mirror, the letter reads: 'We have even been criticised for "forcing" the boys to go to church on Sunday, the day of the accident.' He then points out that churches are for praying in.   

The note, dated September 5, 1997, has now been sold for £2,300 at auction by a dealer on behalf of a private client who said the letter was 'historically significant'. 

The auction house Reeman Dansie said the letter expressed the Duke's 'strong feelings regarding the press and public hysteria and criticism after the death of Princess Diana' and 'how it is making the job of protecting and comforting the young Princes difficult.' 

The Queen faced criticism for failing to return to London to witness the tens of thousands of mourners who had left floral tributes for Diana. She appeared at Buckingham Palace on the eve of Diana's funeral

Mourners had flocked to the Royal Palaces, including Buckingham Palace, in the wake of Diana's death. But many questioned why the Queen had remained in Balmoral for four days after the death was announced 

Princess Diana, the first wife of Prince Charles, was killed in a horrific car crash in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in Paris in August 1997. She died aged 36.

At the time, the Queen faced criticism for failing to capture the mood of the grieving nation.

Public anger began after the Queen took Prince William and Prince Harry to church at Balmoral, just a few hours after Prince Charles had broken the news to them of their mother's death.

There were also accusations that the Queen remained in Scotland for too long, and did not return quickly enough to London, where thousands had gathered in united grief over the Diana's death. 

Compounding the Queen’s absence was the lack of any flag flying at half-mast above Buckingham Palace as a sign of royal mourning. 

The Queen made an eve-of-funeral live broadcast  from inside Buckingham Palace, telling mourners there were 'lessons to be drawn from (Diana’s) life and from the extraordinary and moving reaction to her death'

Tony Blair - who had been Prime Minister for a matter of months - addressed the nation from outside St Mary Magdalene Church in Trimdon in his Sedgefield constituency, calling Diana 'the people's princess'

It also took the Royal Family four days to inspect the flowers that had been laid in tribute to Diana at the castle gates in the Scottish Highlands.  

The Queen had reportedly been encouraging this sense of detachment for the sake of her grandsons, but was reportedly convinced later by her advisers to shift her stance on how to handle Diana's death.

Four days after Diana's death was announced, the Royal Family made a rare public statement, saying it was hurt by suggestions that it was indifferent to the country's sorrow over Diana's death.

In the statement it said: 'The princess was a much loved national figure, but she was also a mother whose sons miss her deeply. 

'Prince William and Prince Harry themselves want to be with their father and their grandparents at this time in the quiet haven of Balmoral.' 

Her Majesty then made an eve-of-funeral live broadcast to the nation from inside Buckingham Palace, telling mourners there were 'lessons to be drawn from (Diana’s) life and from the extraordinary and moving reaction to her death'. 

The Union Jack was then flown at half-mast at Buckingham Palace during the funeral ceremony.

Years later, Sir Michael Oswald and his wife Lady Angela Oswald, friends of the late Queen Mother, said she had been hugely upset and the 'cruel, unfair criticism' levelled at her daughter.  

In direct contrast, on the very day Diana's death was announced, Tony Blair - who had been Prime Minister for a matter of months -  addressed the nation from outside St Mary Magdalene Church in Trimdon in his Sedgefield constituency.

The now-famous speech, written on the back of an envelope after advice from his spin doctor Alastair Campbell, was watched by millions and later featured in the film The Queen, starring Helen Mirren.

He said: 'She was the people’s princess and that’s how she will stay, how she will remain in our hearts and in our memories forever.'

The two-minute appearance became so famous  that a stone plaque was put on the path exactly where Mr Blair stood to make his moving tribute.
