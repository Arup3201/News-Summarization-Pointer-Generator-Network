PSV coach Phillip Cocu has predicted Memphis Depay could be as good as Arjen Robben and admitted the flying Dutchman will probably leave at the end of the season.

The 21-year-old winger, who has scored a remarkable 18 goals already this campaign, was linked with moves to both Tottenham and Manchester United in the summer.

But instead he remained in Holland, becoming a key figure in PSV's domination of the Eredivisie.

‘Whether he can be as good as Arjen Robben? I think so,’ Cocu told Russia's Sport Express in the build-up to Thursday’s Europa League clash against Zenit St Petersburg.

‘They are different players, but they are both fast and have a good shot. And both always have the urge to learn. 

'But Memphis is only 21-years-old and only in a few years can real conclusions be drawn.

Depay’s performances have attracted the attention of several top clubs in Europe and Cocu realises there is a chance the player will leave at the end of this season.

‘That's unfortunate, but on the other hand, we must as a club be proud because we have trained him. At some point, it becomes clear that he is ready for the next step. And yes, I think he's going to leave PSV after this season.’
