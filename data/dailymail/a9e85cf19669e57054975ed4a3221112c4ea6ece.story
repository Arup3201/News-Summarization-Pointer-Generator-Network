A former magistrate who fractionally strayed over the white lines of a parking bay has condemned the 'petty' £75 fine he was given.

Ron Wotherspoon, 65, found the ticket on his Mercedes Benz A-Class car after he left it marginally in a hatched area at a country train station.

He claims he was forced to park slightly outside of the bay as a neighbouring Range Rover had left him with no room to get out of his car.

'Petty' fine: Ron Wotherspoon said he was forced to park outside the lines by a neighbouring Range Rover

He said he was not blocking any vehicles or exits and said the £75 penalty was 'petty'.

Mr Wotherspoon said: 'While I am the first to criticise people who park badly in car parks, on this occasion the cross-hatched area was not on a right of way or emergency access.

'I could not see how I would be doing anything other than making use of a bay that would have otherwise been unusable.

'As can be seen the area is in front of a lamp post and I left plenty of access to that.

'It's just petty. It's not a good way to encourage people to respect the action they take.'

Mr Wotherspoon, a business mentor from Cambridge, found himself booked at Audley End station in the village of Wendens Ambo, Essex.

He successfully appealed against the penalty and car park operators have cancelled the fine.

Ron Wotherspoon said parking fines for infractions like his don't encourage people to 'respect their actions'

An NCP spokesman said: 'Our colleagues on the ground have the very clear brief that all cars parked outside of the bay lines must receive a penalty notice.

'The appeals process allows the management team to review the image provided when the offence has taken place and gives us a second opportunity to assess each situation on a case by case basis.

'With this in mind we have reviewed the image and are happy to cancel this penalty notice as a gesture of goodwill.'
