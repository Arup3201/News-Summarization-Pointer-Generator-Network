Investigation: Bob Dylan is facing a French lawsuit after being accused of a racist slur against Croats

Bob Dylan is being investigated in France after a Croatian community organisation alleged that comments he made to Rolling Stone magazine last year amounted to incitement to racial hatred, Paris prosecutors said today.

In the interview, which was published in the magazine's September 27, 2012 edition, the singer said racism was holding America back.

'This country is just too f***** up about colour. It's a distraction. People at each others' throats just because they are of a different colour.

'It's the height of insanity, and it will hold any nation back - or any neighbourhood back. Or any anything back,' Dylan said.

'Blacks know that some whites didn't want to give up slavery - that if they had their way, they would still be under the yoke, and they can't pretend they don't know that.

'If you got a slave master or Klan in your blood, blacks can sense that. That stuff lingers to this day. Just like Jews can sense Nazi blood and the Serbs can sense Croatian blood.'

The formal investigation followed a legal complaint from the organisation, CRICCF, which is based in France, alleging that the comments as carried in the French version of the magazine violated French racial hatred laws.

CRICCF secretary general Vlatko Maric
confirmed that Parisian courts have agreed to hear the case and have 
requested Dylanâ€™s presence during the hearing, the International 
Business Times reports.

In
a statement, Maric said: 'It is an incitement to hatred. You cannot 
compare Croatian criminals to all Croats. But we have nothing against 
Rolling Stone magazine or Bob Dylan as a singer. '

In France, racism complaints automatically trigger formal investigations, irrespective of the merits of the case. Dylan was awarded France's prestigious Legion d'Honneur award last month in Paris.

Minister Aurelie Filippetti said that, for French people, he embodied a
'subversive cultural force that can change people and the world'.

Dylan's
remarks have already had a knock-on effect in Croatia, with several 
radio stations removing his music from their playlists.

Bob
Dylan has sold over 110 million records around the world and continues 
to tour extensively, logging up more than 2,500 shows since 1988.

The
Croatian/Serbian conflict culminated with the Croatian War of 
Independence from 1991 to 1995, during which Croatia broke away from 
Yugoslavia.

Both Croatia and Serbia have lodged cases at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, accusing each other of genocide.

Dylan's manager and Rolling Stone are yet to comment.
