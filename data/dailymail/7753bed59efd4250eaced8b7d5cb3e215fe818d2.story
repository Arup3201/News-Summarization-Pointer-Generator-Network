Angel di Maria says Manchester United are '100 per cent confident' that they will cement a top four place come the end of the season.

United travel to arch-rivals Liverpool on Sunday afternoon - in a match that could prove decisive in the race for a Champions League spot.

Di Maria is available once more for the Red Devils after serving a one-game suspension following his red card in their 2-1 FA Cup loss at home to Arsenal on March 9.

Angel di Maria says Manchester United are '100 per cent confident' that they will cement a top four place

The 27-year-old missed United's 3-0 win over Tottenham as a result on March 15 - a fixture that started a run of tricky results for Louis van Gaal's men.

United's match with Liverpool is swiftly followed by fixtures against Manchester City and Chelsea in April, as well as another encounter with Arsenal in the penultimate game of the season in May.

And despite the daunting fixture list, Di Maria insists he and his team-mates will ensure that an indifferent campaign will end on a high.

'We are all aware that a number of big games are just around the corner, and the season will be decided by these fixtures,' Angel explained in a recent interview in United Review, Old Trafford's matchday programme.

'We know all about these upcoming games and we have been thinking and talking about them for quite some time now. We've known that everything would be at stake over this final period of the season.

'Everyone at the club is 100 per cent confident, we know we want to get back into the Champions League and that we want to be fighting it out. We'll battle hard right to the end of the season. From what I know of the club, United always fight right to the end and that's what we're going to do.'
