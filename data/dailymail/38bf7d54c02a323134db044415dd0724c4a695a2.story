Sir John Betjeman once said that his biggest regret in life was not having had ‘enough sex’.

Yet for a man with a wife and two mistresses, this may seem an unusual lament.

For decades, Britain’s best-loved modern poet was torn between his love for three women – his faithful wife, Penelope; long-term mistress Lady Elizabeth Cavendish, a childhood friend of the Queen; and Margie Geddes, who was revealed to have been his lover only after she died in 2006.

Romance: More than 100 letters and postcards were sent by former Poet Laureate Sir John Betjeman, right, to his secret lover Margie Geddes, left

On display: After being stored under a bed for decades, the private, passionate thoughts of Sir John Betjeman are to go on show to the public for the first time. Some of the letters are pictured

Now, almost 30 years since the Poet 
Laureate’s death, details of their secret affair have been revealed for 
the first time following the emergence of more than 100 love letters Mrs
Geddes had kept hidden under her bed.

The deeply touching notes show the 
intensity of Betjeman’s ardour during their liaison, where he writes of 
their ‘delicious and wonderful evenings’ together.

In one he says: ‘Darling Margie, I 
fear you are bound to haunt my mind for the rest of my life. I like this
haunting. I feel I can rest in you and depend on you.’

In another, he writes: ‘I long to be 
in your arms and comforted and able to talk to you for hours alone... It
is very selfish of me to demand so much of you in sympathy and warmth 
but as you have both I must rest in them.’

In a note sent in October 1970, he 
asks when his lover is free to have lunch with him, adding: ‘I long and 
ache to see you. Love Jo.B.’

Even before his marriage, Betjeman had
a reputation as a ladies’ man and had been engaged three times. But it 
was not until the death of Mrs Geddes, aged 98, that it emerged the 
mother of two was not only a friend but his lover.

The affair was revealed by her son Andrew, who said it was her wish that, once she was gone, the world should learn the truth.

Affair: The letters show Sir John had a four-year affair with Mrs Geddes in the 1970s while he was married to Penelope, pictured

They met in 1929 at a sports day at 
Heddon Court prep school in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, where Betjeman 
was a 22-year-old English master.

She was 20 and had gone to see her two
younger brothers compete.

She wrote of this first encounter: 
‘Quite suddenly in a flash I was aware that this was no ordinary person,
but someone very special. No, it wasn’t love, it was just an awareness 
of potential greatness.’

Rare: The museum will not just feature the love letters but also other forms of the poet's work

Unique: This picture shows another of Betjeman's original works which will be displayed from October

Sir John Betjeman is one of the most popular British Poet Laureates and was also a much-loved television personality.

He was born in north London in August 1906 and eventually attended Marlborough College and Magdalen College, Oxford.

He started his career as a journalist but continued to write poetry.

In 1931 he had his first book of poems, called Mount Zion, published.

His prolific writing continued throughout the 1930s and 40s.

By the 1950s, he was a well-known figure across the country, often making television and radio appearances.

He was knighted in 1969 and made Poet Laureate in 1972. He died on May 19, 1984.

But within three years the 
relationship had ended after she learned of his marriage to Penelope 
Chetwode, the daughter of a former commander-in-chief of the Indian 
army.

Later, Margie married Alexander Geddes and had two children, 
although by the time she met her ‘Betje’ again in 1960 her marriage had 
ended.

They became lovers after she invited 
him to a literary speaking engagement in Jersey. At this time he was 
having an affair with Lady Elizabeth, the daughter of the tenth Duke of 
Devonshire and lady-in-waiting to Princess Margaret.

Mrs Geddes once said: ‘He was a highly
sexed man, practically to his death’, but added: ‘To be with John B was
to enter another world – a more scintillating world, with the freshness
of a child’s outlook, where everything is a discovery, nothing taken 
for granted, things seen not with the sight but with his vision and 
enhanced by his imagination.’

The letters, the last of which was 
sent two years before Betjeman’s death in 1984, will be on show from 
October 27 at Tom Brown’s School Museum in Uffington, Oxfordshire, where
the poet once lived.

Despite his affairs, Betjeman and his 
wife were married for 53 years and had two children, Paul and Candida. 
Candida has helped transcribe the love letters.

Poet: Sir John Betjeman first met Mrs Geddes when he was in his 20s

Come, friendly bombs, and fall on Slough!It isn't fit for humans now,There isn't grass to graze a cow.Swarm over, Death!

Come, bombs and blow to smithereensThose air -conditioned, bright canteens,Tinned fruit, tinned meat, tinned milk, tinned beans,Tinned minds, tinned breath.

Mess up the mess they call a town-A house for ninety-seven downAnd once a week a half a crownFor twenty years.

And get that man with double chinWho'll always cheat and always win,Who washes his repulsive skinIn women's tears:

And smash his desk of polished oakAnd smash his hands so used to strokeAnd stop his boring dirty jokeAnd make him yell.

But spare the bald young clerks who add

The profits of the stinking cad;It's not their fault that they are mad,They've tasted Hell.

(This is a shortened version of 'Slough')
