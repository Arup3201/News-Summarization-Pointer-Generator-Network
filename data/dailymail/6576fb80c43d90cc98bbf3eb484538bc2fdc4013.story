Foreign migrants will be banned from receiving benefits unless they earn a minimum of £149 a week, under new rules unveiled today.

From March 1st people from European countries who claim to have been in work or self-employed in order to gain access to a wider range of benefits will face a more robust test.

Under current EU law the definition of a ‘worker’ is very broad meaning that those who work just a few hours a week in a pub once a week can access Housing Benefit, Child Benefit and Child Tax Credits.

Now, the definitions of 'worker' are very broad, to the point that only a few hours work a week entitle a person to things like housing benefit and child support. But under new rules, this definition will become a lot stricter

To show they are undertaking genuine and effective work in the UK a European migrant will have to show that for the last three months they have been earning at the level at which employees start paying National Insurance.

The new minimum income threshold is the equivalent of a working 24 hours a week at the minimum wage.

Those who qualify as a ‘worker’ will be able to claim benefits, including JobSeeker’s Allowance if they fall out of work.

They will also be able to claim Income Support and Employment and Support Allowance as well.

Those who fail to meet the minimum income requirement will be classed as a jobseeker or not economically active and will have to wait three months after they start searching for work before they can claim JSA. From April 1st they will also have to wait three months before claiming Housing benefit as well.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: ‘As part of the Government’s long-term economic plan we have taken action to make sure our economy delivers for people who want to work hard, play by the rules and contribute to this country.

‘These reforms will ensure we have a 
fair system - one which provides support for genuine workers and 
jobseekers, but does not allow people to come to our country and take 
advantage of our benefits system.

‘The
 British public are rightly concerned that migrants should contribute to
 this country, and not be drawn here by the attractiveness of our 
benefits system.’

Migrants to the UK will be under particular scrutiny under the new laws, in order to prevent 'benefit tourism' by new EU countries

The level of the minimum income requirement will be permanently pegged to the level of the National Insurance Contributions Threshold, which is £149 a week--£7755 a year-- in 2013/14, and £153 a week, or £7956 a year, in 2014/15.

The changes come after David Cameron set out a number of areas where he wanted the benefit system to be tightened in a speech last year.

The Prime Minister demanded action amid concerns from MPs that the end of restrictions on new arrivals from Bulgaria and Romania - lifted on January 1st - would lead to a huge influx of migrants.

Since January 1st all migrants from the European Economic Area have been subjected to a tougher ‘habitual residence test’ and will have to wait for three months before they can get income-based JSA.

If they pass the test jobseekers will then only be able to get JSA for 6 months. After 6 months, only those who have a job offer or compelling evidence that they have a genuine chance of finding work will be able to continue claiming.

A DWP source added: ‘This is all part of the Government’s long term plan to cap welfare and reduce immigration so our economy delivers for people who actively contribute and want to work hard and play by the rules.’
