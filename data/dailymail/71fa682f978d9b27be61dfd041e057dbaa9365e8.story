Tottenham and QPR are leading the chase for former Manchester United and England defender Rio Ferdinand.

The 35-year-old defender is available on a free transfer after ending his 12-year association at Old Trafford and has attracted interest from a number of clubs around the world.

Sportsmail revealed that United chief Ed Woodward informed Ferdinand that he would not be offered a new contract in the away dressing-room at Southampton on the final day of the season, but the player had already moved his wife Rebecca and three children back down to London from their Cheshire home in anticipation of leaving the club.

Ferdinand will weigh up his options over the next few weeks but it is understood that Tottenham have registered an interest and he has already held talks with Harry Redknapp, the man who gave him a senior debut at West Ham in 1996, over a move to newly-promoted QPR.

A return to West Ham is another possibility for one of the most gifted centre-backs of his generation, with Sam Allardyce under pressure to play a more attractive football at Upton Park next season, and Crystal Palace may also offer him the chance to finish his career in the Premier League.

Ferdinand’s return to London does not necessarily rule out a short-term move abroad and there is interest from Turkey, China, the Middle East and America’s Major League Soccer, but it is understood that the former Leeds defender would prefer to stay in England.

Ferdinand has a number of interests outside of the game and will also make his debut as a TV pundit for the BBC at the World Cup.
