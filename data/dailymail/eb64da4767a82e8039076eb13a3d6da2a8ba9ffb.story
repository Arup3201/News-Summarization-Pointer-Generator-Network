A judge in 
Alabama has struck down a medical malpractice lawsuit claiming that a disabled Birmingham man went down for a circumcision but woke up to find his penis had been amputated.

In his suit, Johnny Lee Banks Jr., 56, says he was receiving treatment at the Princeton Baptist Medical Center late July when the routine procedure was to take place.

The double amputee, who was undergoing a series of surgeries, said he woke up the next day and his privates had been chopped down to about one inch, WBRC reported.

But attorneys for the hospital on Thursday asked a Jefferson County judge to dismiss the case because Bank's lawyer, John Graves, failed to review any of his client's medical records.

Instead, hospital attorney Mike Florie said
 Banks has a history of 'diabetic wet gangrene,' which led to dead 
tissue accumulation in the patient's lower extremities, according to AL.com.

The attorneys — who also represent two doctors and the clinics Urology Centers of Alabama and Simon-Williamson — said that Banks failed to provide a 'detailed specification and factual description' of the incident, according to WBRC.

'I know there are strong feelings on both
 sides,' Jefferson County Circuit Judge Jim Hughey III said in court, AL.com reported.

'It is just what the law requires.'

In court on Thursday, Banks grunted audibly when lawyers for the hospital said there was no physical evidence that penis had been amputated, according to local reports.

His wife Zelda, 55, is also suing for loss of consortium due to the botched operation.

Graves can refile his case within 30 days if he finds enough evidence to substantiate his claims.

He says the physical evidence in his case should be enough.

The 'proof is in the pudding,' he told AL.com.

'Looks like I've got to get back to the drawing board and refile my complaint,' the attorney added.

In his lawsuit, Banks says he has been left in extreme pain and has spent additional time recovering in the hospital.

Banks, who does not work due to a disability, was seeking an unspecified dollar amount in the suit.
