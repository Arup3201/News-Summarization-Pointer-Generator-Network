For any self respecting scuba assassin, they are the essential weapons.

From the Heckler & Koch P11 underwater pistol to the the Special Underwater Assault Rifle that can shoot darts, weapons makers have created a whole line of underwater weapons.

As normal guns and ammunition do not work underwater, they also have their own ammunition, with many firing darts rather than bullets.

Standard ammunition can be fired underwater, but the range and accuracy is hugely affected by water.

Therefore, weapons designers based underwater pistols on spears rather than bullets, shrinking them down to fit in a handheld gun.

The first weapon is believed to be Germany's Heckler & Koch P11 Underwater Pistol.

Originally designed in the 1970's, it fires up to five fin stabilized, rocket propelled darts that are self contained inside individual barrels.

Since ordinary-shaped rounds are inaccurate and have a very short range when used underwater, this pistol fires steel darts about 10 centimetres (3.9 in) long.

It has five barrels, each of which is loaded with a cartridge.

After firing all five cartridges, the barrel unit must be sent back to its manufacturer for reloading.

The darts measure 7.62mm X 100mm and are effective underwater to about 50 feet near the surface, with decaying range the deeper you descend into the abyss.

Above water, the P11 has a range of about 100 feet, although experts say its accuracy is poor.

Russia also developed underwater weapons.

The SPP-1 Underwater Pistol was made in the USSR for use underwater by Soviet frogmen as an underwater firearm.

It was developed in the late 1960s and accepted for use in 1971.

It fires a round-based 4.5 millimetres (0.18 in) caliber steel dart about 115 millimetres (4.5 in) long.

Russia continued to build underwater weapons, and lat year unveiled the ADS.

Designed by Russia's Tula Instrument Design Bureau, it can be fitted with silencers andÂ  grenade launchers, and fire both on land and in water.

It is equipped with a 40 mm grenade launcher which has a range of 400 m.

It can fire at a rate of 700 shots/min with a range on land of 500 m.

The weapon's effective underwater firing range when using the specially designed cartridge is about 25 meters at a depth of 30 meters, it is claimed.

The ADS was under extensive field trials by undisclosed units of Russian Naval special forces.
