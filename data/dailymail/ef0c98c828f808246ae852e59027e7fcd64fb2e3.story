A US citizen believed to be a retired 
US army officer who was arrested in Egypt for violating the national 
night-time curfew has been found hanged in his police cell.

The US Embassy in Cairo confirmed that James
Henry Lunn, who was held prisoner in the Suez Canal city of Ismailia, 
died from an apparent suicide and that it was in contact with Egyptian 
authorities.

A statement by the Egyptian Interior 
Ministry, which is in charge of police, said Lunn was detained on August 
27 during 'combing operations' that followed a car bombing outside a 
police station in the turbulent northern region of Sinai.

It said a computer and maps of 'important installations' were found in his possession, but did not identify the facilities.

Lunn, it continued, was remanded in police custody and was remanded again for 30 days by a court on Saturday.

In
Washington, the State Department said U.S. consular officials in Cairo 
were informed of his arrest on August 28, a day after the Egyptians 
detained him.

Consular officials had been in touch with Egyptian authorities and Lunn since, it said.

He
was found hanged on Sunday at the door of the bathroom of his cell 
block in an Ismailia police station. Lunn had a visit from a U.S. 
consulate official last Tuesday, it added.

A coroner has been appointed to determine the cause of death, the statement said.

Security officials earlier said he was a retired U.S. Army officer, a claim denied by the State Department.

Lunn arrived in Cairo from the Gulf kingdom of Bahrain on August 25, Egyptian officials said.

Held: Egyptian officials said Lunn was detained by army troops in Sinai three days later while making his way to the border crossing with Gaza in the town of Rafah (above, file picture)

They
had said he was detained by army troops in Sinai three days later while
making his way to the border crossing with Gaza in the town of Rafah.

He
was flown to Ismailia on a military aircraft and handed over to the 
police there, the officials said. Jailers found him dead after he used 
his belt and shoe laces to hang himself, the officials said. They spoke 
on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to 
journalists.

The Interior 
Ministry and the security officials earlier mistakenly identified the 
American as James Henry Allen and James Henry. Such confusion is common 
in Egypt in the case of foreign names that are transliterated from 
English, often with some liberty.

The
American is the second foreigner to die in Egyptian custody since last 
month. Then, authorities said cell mates beat a French man to death 
after his arrest in Cairo's upscale district of Zamalek for violating 
curfew.

The latest death is
likely to revive the furor about poor conditions and human rights 
violations in Egyptian jails. Two Canadian citizens jailed for weeks 
before their release last week complained of torture and inhuman 
conditions.

However, the 
State Department said Lunn had at no time complained to U.S. consular 
officials that he had been maltreated by the Egyptians. It confirmed the
Egyptians' claim that Lunn was last visited by a U.S. consular officer 
on October 8.

The 
American's arrest came at a time when the military and security forces 
are fighting Islamic militants in northern Sinai, where they have been 
attacked daily since the overthrow of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi 
in a July 3 military coup.

Authorities
have arrested more than 2,000 Morsi supporters since, including leaders
of his Muslim Brotherhood, in the biggest campaign against Islamists 
since the early 1980s.

Authorities
slapped a nighttime curfew on much of Egypt in August following a wave 
of violence stemming from the popularly backed military coup.

Meanwhile
Sunday, a Soviet-made MiG-21 fighter jet belonging to the Egyptian air 
force crashed while on a training mission near the southern ancient city
of Luxor, killing a villager on the ground and injuring three, 
officials said. The pilot bailed out and parachuted safely to the 
ground.

The plane crash set
several houses on fire and damaging an elementary school. The fire was 
quickly put out, said security and medical officials, speaking on 
condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the 
media.

Col. Ahmed Mohammed 
Ali, a military spokesman, said on his official Facebook page that the 
plane crashed as a result of a mechanical failure. He gave no other 
details.

The Russian-made 
MiG warplanes and other Soviet-made aircraft were once the backbone of 
Egypt's air force. They began to be replaced by U.S.-made fighter jets, 
mainly the F-16, starting from the 1980s.
