Dating website Plenty Of Fish (POF) has announced a radical rule shake-up to stop 'sleazy' men harassing female members for sex, and to reduce the number of men pretending to be women in order to have 'horny' conversations with other men.

The free membership site's Canadian founder Markus Frind messaged users to explain the changes - which include removing the Intimate Encounters option - and outlining that the measures are being imposed in order for the service to focus more keenly on creating 'meaningful relationships'.

POF - which has 55 million members worldwide, 3.3m daily users and an annual turnover of £6.6m - has also imposed a ban on contacting anyone with whom the age gap is 14 years or more.

Plenty Of Fish wishes to focus on creating 'meaningful relationships', and have removed the option for contacting someone if you are after an 'intimate encounter'

The announcement was made to POF customers via the site. Frind - who estimates one billion babies will have been born to partners who met on his site - said: 'When I created POF, I wanted it to be all about finding relationships with the right person.

'I got the site to 10 million users without any employees, people and POF was generating a ton of relationships. But around three years ago, everyone started using the website via mobile phones.'

About 70 per cent of the site's users log on via a mobile phone, and Frind added: 'Unfortunately about two per cent of men have started to use POF as more of a hookup site mostly due the casual nature of cell phone use.'

The dating website was founded in 2003, and now has a turnover of more than £6.6m a year

Frind says many women on the site are actually men pretending to be female

1. First contact cannot be sexual: 'Anyone who tries to get around this rule will be deleted without warning.'

2.
Users can only contact others who are not more than 14 years younger or
older than themselves. There is 'no reason for a 50 year old man to 
contact a 18 year old women,' according to POF.

3. Intimate Encounters have been terminated. According to POF 
statistics, there are 3.3 million people who use the site every day, and
of those there are only 6,000 single women looking for intimate 
encounters.

And of those 6,000 women, many are men. 'Intimate Encounters
on POF can be summed up as a bunch of horny men talking to a bunch of 
horny men pretending to be women,' Frind said.
