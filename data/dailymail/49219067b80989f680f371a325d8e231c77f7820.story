An NYPD police psychologist has been accused by her husband of shooting him in the head while he was sleeping so that she could run-off with her married lover.

Kenneth Dearden Jr, 47, filed for a temporary restraining order last week in White Plains, New York where he reportedly claimed his 46-year-old wife Emily tried to kill him and make it look like a home invasion.

On November 14 last year, real estate developer Mr Dearden was found with gunshot wounds at his large home in the well-to-do Yonkers area. 

Kenneth Dearden, 47, filed a lawsuit last week where he reportedly claimed his 46-year-old wife Emily tried to kill him last year by shooting him in the head at their New York home to run off with her lover

The couple, pictured with their daughters, on a family vacation. Mr Dearden has now claimed in a restraining order lawsuit that his wife tried to kill him in a staged home invasion 

His wife shot him 'execution-style' with a 22-caliber weapon so she could be with her lover whom she had been having an affair with for two years, according to court papers, The New York Post reported. 

Her lover was named as Warren Roudebush, of Texas, who allegedly ended his own marriage, according to court documents seen by The Post. 

Calls to Mr Roudebush's home went unanswered on Friday.

According to the Supreme Court lawsuit: 'With [Kenneth] no longer in the picture, [Emily] could avoid a contentious divorce, keep the marital home and never admit the marriage infidelity to any family and friends.'

According to legal documents seen by lohud.com, Mr Dearden said he fell asleep on November 14 and awoke with 'searing pain in his jaw' and blood around him.

His wife was not in bed and he claimed that he thought he saw her in the doorway.

Mr Dearden survived the shooting but had to have several surgeries to remove the bullet which entered near the base of his skull and lodged in his left cheek.

No one has been charged in the shooting at the home, worth more than $500,000 according to records, where the couple live with their young daughters. Calls to the Dearden family home were not answered on Friday. 

According to Lohud.com, Mrs Dearden filed for divorce in August. 

The Westchester District Attorney's Office was unable to comment due to an ongoing criminal investigation.

Authorities investigating the property developer's home in Yonkers last year after he was shot in the head and alerted authorities

In a CBS report from November 2013, Mr Dearden was alert and talking when paramedics arrived at his home after he called 911. 

Detectives at the time did not believe that his injury was self-inflicted.

A dog, believed to be the family's Rottweiler, did not react during an alleged home invasion last year 

His wife, Emily, an NYPD psychologist was treated at the scene for a minor head wound.

Mr Rearden's lawsuit reportedly said that his wife claimed she had been 'knocked out' by an intruder. 

During the home invasion, according to the lawsuit seen by The Post, the family's alarm didn't go off and the alleged intruder didn't set off the pet Rottweiler.

Mr Dearden's lawsuit also reportedly claimed that his wife refused medical treatment and washed the bed sheets and her nightgown while he was in hospital. 

He also reportedly claimed that his wife met her lover for coffee the next morning.

Police would not say who fired the weapon or if it was an accident or a crime. 

Emily Dearden was questioned last November but not charged. 

Mrs Dearden is also a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan. 

MailOnline was awaiting a comment from Emily Dearden’s lawyer, Paul B. Bergman, on Friday.  

Yonkers police Lt. Patrick McCormack told The Post that the case was 'complex'. MailOnline was awaiting a response from Yonkers police on Friday. 

Meister Seelig & Fein, listed as Mr Dearden's attorneys on court documents, were unavailable for comment when contacted by MailOnline on Friday.

Mr Dearden, who is originally from Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, is President for Development at real estate company, Metro Partners and is also President of the Yonkers Downtown/Waterfront Business Improvement District.

Metro Partners website lists him as a former investment banker at JPMorgan Chase.
