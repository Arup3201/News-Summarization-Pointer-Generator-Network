The head of Chicago's largest hedge fund has been accused of using 'coercion' to pressure his wife into signing a prenup in 2003 that could now keep her from claiming a significant share of her husband's $5.6billion fortune.

Anne Dias-Griffin, 43, filed a petition in response to Kenneth Griffin, 45, who initiated the divorce back in July while his wife was driving to the airport with their three children for vacation.

At stake is Mr Griffin's large fortune, reported by Bloomberg to be $5.6billion. Mr Griffin founded the hedge fund Citadel LLC in 1990 and it now manages $16billion of assets according to Forbes.

Under pressure: Anne Dias-Griffin, 43, claims her husband, Ken Griffin, 45, got her to sign the prenup limiting her share in divorce proceedings through 'coercion.'

Mrs Dias-Griffin is also seeking sole custody of the kids, ages 6, 4 and 2, in order to move them with her to New York.

The prenuptial agreement was signed back in 2003 and outlined the 'division of marital and non-marital property.'

According to the filing, Mrs Dias-Griffin was not able to look over the prenup with a lawyer until shortly before the wedding, and it was only three days before the ceremony that Mr Griffin's financials were disclosed.

At the time, Mrs Dias-Griffin was in charge of her own hedge fund, Aragon Global Management, in New York.

Mrs Dias-Griffin said that after explaining her misgivings, 'Ken became so angry, violent, and intimidating, that he destroyed a piece of furniture in their home.'

Page Six quotes a source that explains, 'he was holding onto their four-poster bed, one post became unstuck and the bed collapsed.'

Mr Griffin finally suggested that they visit a psychologist to settle the dispute. The petition states that, 'Anne was unduly influenced by Kenneth and the psychologist under the guise of a counseling session with a neutral psychologist.'

Mrs Dias-Griffin found out later that Mr Griffin and the therapist had a business relationship, and claims the only purpose of the meeting was to persuade her to sign the agreement right before the rehearsal dinner.

The ensuing wedding ceremony took place in Versailles, France, as a two-day blowout that featured performances by Cirque du Soleil and superstar diva Donna Summer, according to Fortune.

Attorneys for Mr Griffin at Berger Schatz released a statement calling these claims 'salacious and simply untrue.'

'Ken will respond to Anneâ€™s allegations on the merits, move this process forward, and protect his close relationship with the children,' it went on to state.

According to Mrs Dias-Griffin, the closest Mr Griffin has been to spending time alone with his children was four weekends he spent with the six-year-old and a caregiver. He left Mrs Dias-Griffin in 2012 and at the time she was pregnant with their youngest child.

The divorce filing 'blindsided' Mrs Dias-Griffin in July, according to a source quoted by the New York Post, and led her to hire Robert S. Cohen, who has represented clients such as Michael Bloomberg and Ivana Trump.

The filing claims the prenup would exclude Mrs Dias-Griffin from the couple's vast art collection and real estate holdings.

In 2012, Mr Griffin spent $15million on a penthouse condo at the Park Tower in Chicago, believed to be the most ever paid for such a property in the city.

Last year, the hedge fund billionaire purchased four Palm Beach properties for $130million to add to his portfolio.

The couple also own a vast Balinese-style, beach-front property at the Hualalai resort in Hawaii which was purchased in 2011 for around $17million, The Wall Street Journal reported.

The Griffins have donated widely to philanthropic endeavors and political campaigns, leaning in support of Republican causes.

They are also keen art lovers. In 2006, the Griffins bought contemporary painting False Start by Jasper Johns for a reported $80 million from media mogul David Geffen.

Mrs Griffin is said to have encouraged her husband's love of art and they had their first date at a museum. She is a director of the Museum of Modern Art, a trustee of the Foundation for Contemporary Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art.

Mr Griffin has been married before but divorced in the mid-Nineties.
