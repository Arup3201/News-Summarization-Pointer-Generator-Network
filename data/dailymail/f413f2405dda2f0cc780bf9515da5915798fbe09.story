The Tweed family have been named the world's oldest family with a combined age of 1,019 years, 336 days. L-R: Front row: Ralph, Reginald, Elsie, Robert, Noel, Eric.  Back row: Eunice, Phyllis, Valerie, Malcolm, Ronnie

The brothers and sisters are: Elsie, 95, Reginald, 92, Robert, 91, Cynthia, 89, Ralph, 87, Noel, 85, Eric, 83, Ronald, 82, Malcolm, 81, Valerie, 79, Phyllis, 78, and Eunice 76.

A grainy black-and-white photo taken in 1939 shows the siblings in the back garden of their three-bedroom council house with parents Flo and Percy.

Brewery drayman Percy and barmaid Flo brought up their large family in Coventry and had a staggering 16 children in 21 years.

The siblings grew up in Coventry with four others who have now died L-R: Phyllis, Valerie, Ronnie, Noel, Eric, Ralph, Cynthia, Jessie, Robert, Reginald, Julia, Elsie, Joseph and Eunice, with mum Florence and dad Percy

Four of the siblings have since died and some of the rest have moved further afield, living in Wolverhampton, Leicester, and Wales.

The Tweed's world record for the oldest family was officially dated on November 25 last year when their combined ages totalled 1,019 years and 336 days (a combination of their years and additional days).

The third youngest child Valerie McCaffrey, 79, received an official certificate from Guinness World Records this week confirming the family's remarkable achievement.

The retired telephonist, who lives in Coventry with her husband Walter, 83, says that the achievement had been a long-time coming.  

The third youngest child Valerie McCaffrey (pictured) was presented with certificate from the Guinness Book of World Records this week following the record being announced in November last year 

'It took over a year for the record to come through.

'They need proof of everything so I was going to and from the registry office to get birth certificates and marriage certificates.

'My son Daniel also had to help with all the computer side of things.'

However, Valerie added that when they were finally awarded their certificate it had been well worth the wait.  

Valerie puts her mother's constant pregnancy down to a lack of television when they were younger 

'Everyone was delighted when it was confirmed and we couldn't wait for the certificates to come.

'When they arrived we were all very excited, they will definitely be going up as pride of place in our houses.

'It is incredible to think we are the oldest family in the world. I knew we were a big family but to be over 1,000 years old is a remarkable achievement.'

The 12 siblings remain close and still meet up every year at their gigantic family gatherings.

Eight of them still live in Coventry where they were brought up by the mum Flo, who died aged 59 in 1956, and dad Percy, who was 73 when he died in 1958.

Valerie has traced her family tree back to 1417 when wool merchant George Tweedy moved down to Essex from Scotland.

ELSIE, 95 - The twice-wed widow once did a milk round on a horse and cart, lives in Coventry.

REGINALD, 92 - Widowed dad-of-three, retired butcher, lives in Coventry.

ROBERT, 91 - Married with two children, he caught malaria in WW2, lives in Measham, Derbs.

CYNTHIA, 89 - Married for 65 years with four children, lives in Wolverhampton, West Mids.

NOEL, 85 - Retired brewery driver who lives in Coventry with sister Elsie.

ERIC, 83 - Married with three children, former head of market traders' association, Coventry.

JOE - The milkman died aged 71 in 1989.

JULIA - The GP surgery worker died aged 72 in 1993.

She added that growing up with so many siblings had been very entertaining and puts her mothers regular pregnancies down to a lack of television.

'Growing up was fun all being in the same house together.

'I think 23 months was the longest time our mother went without being pregnant. But there wasn't really any television in those days.'

Valerie says that when they are reunited it is just as it once was with all the siblings getting along famously.  

'We all keep in touch and we are having a big family gathering in June for my 80th birthday.

'It is great when we all get together. We all natter away for hours and the older brothers talk about their war service.'

Second youngest sibling Phyllis Smith, 78, said: 'We all go on holiday together once a year and five of my brothers and sisters meet up every week for a game of whist.

'We have our moments when we disagree and we do have little cliques but we never fall out or bear a grudge.

'Val and Eunice and I are very close because we are the three youngsters. We go off to the theatre together and do the things women do.

'But Eunice rules us all with a rod of iron. Even though Eunice is the youngest she's the mother figure who has to be obeyed. She is very caring and kind.'

The siblings are so close that they even refused to fall out with each when one of them blew their chance of becoming millionaires.

Phyllis added: 'We all do the lottery together in a syndicate organised by Ralph.

'We always used to include number 39, the number of the house where some of us grew up.

'But because 39 had been coming up a lot Ralph decided to change it one particular week and unfortunately for us we would have won the jackpot.

'We got £300 each instead of being millionaires. Poor Ralph was devastated and came round to each of us and apologised profusely.

'Other families might have broken up over that but we didn't. We were not meant to be rich.'
