A man who killed his girlfriend and beat her corpse so savagely her mother was not allowed to see her remains hung himself before he was due to face a court.

Blake Ross, 36, a 6ft 3in tall former weight trainer, from Two Mile Ash, near Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, was found dead in his cell.

He had been due to stand trial for the murder and mutilation of his partner, mother-of-one Kim Jeffery, also 36, after she ended their relationship.

Out-of-control Ross killed Ms Jeffery as her nine-year-old daughter slept upstairs by punching her in the face and stabbing her several times with a kitchen knife.

He then disfigured her dead body, beating her face so savagely her eyes were forced from their sockets and her teeth smashed into her throat.

Ms Jeffery's distraught mother, Hazel Simpson, 62, described her killer as 'totally evil'.

'Kim was so badly mutilated I was not even allowed to see her body,' she said.

'He had punched her teeth and palate down her throat, her eyes into their sockets and broke her jaw and cheekbones.

'It was totally evil. She phoned me in tears that day and said, 'Mum, he's so possessive... I am frightened of him.

'Although we begged her to come and stay with us she refused, insisting later she was OK and that Blake was in a better mood and had agreed to leave in the morning.'

Miss Jeffery, who ran her own cleaning business, ended her relationship with accountant Ross on April 3 this year and told him to leave her home in Milton Keynes.

But Ross brutally murdered mother-of-one Kim on April 10. He then pummelled her face, broke her jaw and cheek bones and left her body completely disfigured.

Police were called to the home they shared at 8.46pm and Ross was arrested at the scene.

Now Ms Simpson has revealed how Ross became so jealous he burned her daughter's favourite dresses and threaten her for just talking to other men.

'Kim loved meeting people, dancing and playing sport. She was always busy. But Blake hated her doing anything without him,' she said.

'If she so much as talked to another man he gave her an evil stare or even beat them up.

'He burned her favourite dresses but I only learned this after she died.

'We cannot forgive Blake Ross and his death is scant comfort for the loss we feel.

'He was an evil man who killed my beautiful daughter and he deserves to be dead.'

She revealed how Ross would ring Ms Jeffery over ten times an hour whenever she went out for drinks or meals with friends.

'Kim and her friends booked a family holiday with their children before she met him,' said Ms Simpson.

'When she told Blake he tried to book into the hotel next door, Kim just thought he was being over protective.

'Even when she went on the school run, the week before she died, he hobbled after her with his leg in plaster. It just wasn't normal.

'Some people say it would be better if he'd suffered in prison for years but I don't agree. We feel that justice has been done.

'Although she is gone, Kim will live forever in the collective heart of our family, but sadly her young daughter is now forever without a devoted, wonderful mother.'

Post-mortem tests carried out at the time of Kim's death showed that she died from stab wounds and 'blunt force trauma'.

Ross, of Tavelhurst, Two Mile Ash, admitted manslaughter but pleaded not guilty to murder and was due to face trial at Luton Crown Court on October 11.

However, he was found dead in his jail cell at Bedford Prison at 5.45am on June 30.

A Thames Valley Police spokesman said: 'Thames Valley Police can confirm Blake Ross was found dead in his cell at HMP Bedford at 5.45am on June 30.

'The matter is not thought to be suspicious and a post-mortem will be carried in due course.'
