David and Samantha Cameron refer to their Downing Street home as ‘the cage’, and try and escape ‘on a regular basis’, the Prime Minister has revealed.

Mr Cameron scotched rumours that his wife has urged him to quit Number 10 after the next election, saying she was ‘fully supportive of my work’.

But, in a revealing interview with The House magazine, he confirmed that the couple try and escape for regular ‘date nights’ to get away from the stresses of work.

David Cameron has said he and his wife Samantha regularly enjoy nights out to escape the 'cage' of Downing Street, where they have lived since he became Prime Minister in May 2010

‘Last night, we went out for supper - dinner - quite early actually,’ he said. ‘I was tucked up nice and early. We try and get out of the cage on a regular basis.’

He said Mrs Cameron had ‘created a wonderful flat’ in Number 10 after masterminding a major refurbishment, which included the installation of a new £25,000 designer kitchen.

But he said their Oxfordshire constituency home, where they spent Christmas, ‘does feel like home’.

The description of Number 10 as ‘the cage’ sums up the frustration of living above the shop, constantly surrounded by officials. Cherie Blair referred to her Downing Street home as the ‘goldfish bowl’.

Mr Cameron confirmed that it is still his ‘intention’ to send his eldest daughter Nancy to a state secondary school. He has previously said he is ‘terrified’ by the prospect of finding a good school, but said there was now ‘real improvement’ taking place in the capital’s schools.

The Prime Minister also revealed that the Conservatives will campaign on the slogan ‘Don’t turn back’ at the next election. He told House magazine: ‘We’re very “sleeves rolled up”, we were the people that have got Britain on the right track. Don’t turn back, trust us to keep delivering, to keep providing - that’s what the message will be.'

Mr Cameron acknowledged that the party needed to ‘do better’ with black and ethnic minority voters and improve its performance in the major cities if it was to win the election. He said he remained committed to delivering a ‘more diverse party’, and said he was keen to promote more women to senior positions.

He dropped heavy hints that there would be another Cabinet reshuffle before the election, with women MPs likely to be the biggest gainers.

The Prime Minister defended controversial cuts to child benefit for the better off. He acknowledged that people on £50-£60,000 were not ‘rich’ but said they were ‘clearly better off than people on £20-£30,000.’

Mr Cameron said his wife was 'fully supportive' of his work, scotching rumours she had urged him to quit Number 10 after the next election

‘I don’t relish taking money from anyone and, you know, child benefit is a popular and successful benefit,’ he said. ‘It goes to the mum, you know, it’s a good slug of money, £20 for the first child, so I don’t relish taking it away from anyone and people I’m sure put it to good use, but, you know, to govern is to choose. We have to make difficult choices about the deficit and I think this was the right choice.’

He confirmed that he would bring in a much-hyped tax break for married couples before the election.

Mr Cameron also revealed that he is not a fan of the Danish political drama Borgen, which is cult viewing at Westminster, saying it is ‘too much like work’.

But he and his wife are addicted to the Danish crime series The Killing, watching ‘back-to-back’ episodes of the third series over Christmas.
