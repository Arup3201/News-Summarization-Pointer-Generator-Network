A police officer in New Hampshire fired a Taser twice at a 78-year-old driver having a diabetic fit just after the elderly man had crashed into several cars.

Officer Andre Wassouf fired the stun gun on Sunday morning at the fitting man when he came to a halt after he struck his squad car and made a movement as if 'he was going for a weapon'.

The driver was handcuffed immediately after being incapacitated but was not charged with a crime when police realized the man was not intoxicated or on drugs but had dangerously low blood sugar.

Police had received a call at 11.37am about a man who had crashed into two cars in the parking lot of the warehouse club chain on Woodbury Avenue, according to Seacoast Online.

When Officer Wassouf attended the scene, the man, with his window raised down, started driving away.

The driver then ignored Wassouf's order to stop the car, before striking an empty parked vehicle and eventually reversing into the police cruiser, breaking a headlight.

As Wassouf thought the car was in park, he tried to pull the 215-lb man from the vehicle but failed as it kept moving in the neutral position.

The man did not obey several commands to stop, and when he reached for something on the passenger's seat, the officer thought he was going for a weapon and used the stun device on him twice.

'This allowed the officer to finally take control of the situation and get the driver into handcuffs,' Corey MacDonald, deputy Portsmouth police chief. 

Fire Chief Steve Achilles said firefighters observed that the driver was 'weak' after being shocked and determined he was diabetic and his blood sugar was low.

The condition the man suffered from can mimic alcohol abuse or a behavioral problem, he added.

Achilles also said it is not uncommon for diabetics in that condition to be combative or angry which makes responses by emergency officials challenging.

The driver was given intravenous treatment, and his condition rapidly improved. He was taken by ambulance to Portsmouth Regional Hospital as a precaution.

'Upon initial review, though the incident is regrettable for all involved, the officer appears to have used reasonable non-lethal force to end a potentially dangerous situation,' MacDonald said. 

'Our police officers are not paramedics. They are charged with bringing dangerous situations under control. This driver could just as easily have been under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or engaging in willful criminal conduct.'

The incident, like all use-of-force episodes, will be subject to review by a police committee.
