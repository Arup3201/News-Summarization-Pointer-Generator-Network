The behaviour of accused murderer Simon Gittany in the minutes after his ballerina girlfriend plunged to her death from their 15th-storey Sydney apartment was revealed in CCTV footage shown to a jury today.

Dressed in striped pyjama bottoms, he is seen hurrying in and out of the apartment before getting into the lift to ride to the ground floor, slapping his hands onto the top of his head before crouching over, hands on his knees as he descends.

The security camera footage was presented to the court by the prosecution, which claims 40-year-old Gittany threw his 30-year-old Canadian girlfriend Lisa Harnum to her death after a fierce argument over her plans to leave him.

Evidence: CCTV footage shows Simon Gittany holding his hands on his head as he rides a lift moments after he allegedly threw his fiancee to her death off the 15th-floor balcony of their Sydney apartment

Gesticulating: Gittany throws his hands up in the air as he heads to the ground floor where the body of his girlfriend is lying in the street

The court had already heard that a torn-up note was found in Miss Harnum’s jeans’ pocket after her death plunge, which stated: ‘There are surveillance cameras inside and outside the house.’

Today, evidence from CCTV cameras in the hallway was shown to the jury - but despite a security camera being inside the apartment police found it had not recorded any of the 69 seconds between Gittany being seen to drag his girlfriend back into the apartment and her death plunge.

What the video evidence taken from the hallway and the lift did show was an apparently frustrated Gittany moving in and out of the apartment and then getting into the lift following Miss Harnum’s fall.

Chillingly, security footage on the outside of the building captures Miss Harnum hitting the ground on busy Liverpool Street at 9.55.13am on July 30 2011.

Then, at 9.55.27am Gittany, in pyjama bottoms but without a shirt, is seen leaving through the front door of the apartment, putting his hands on his head, before walking back inside a few seconds later.

For the next 33 seconds there is no security camera record of what he did next.

But then at 9.56.08am he is seen leaving apartment 1503 for the second time, pulling a white T-shirt over his head.

A second video shown to the court captures Gittany stepping into a shiny steel-panelled lift, still wearing his pyjama pants. It is then that the lift’s internal security camera take over his actions.

He is seen placing his hands on his head and bending over with hands on his knees. He is also seen throwing his hands up in the air as he stares at the lift doors on the descent.

Finally he is seen running from the lift and through the foyer towards the street where the body of his fiancee is lying.

A third video shown to the court - and which runs for 27 minutes - shows Gittany hurrying towards the street, with buses, cars and pedestrians passing by.

He is seen walking back into the foyer of the luxury complex, accompanied by an unknown person, where he is again seen with his hands on his head before he walks out again

Several people are seen strolling out of the apartment block, apparently unaware of the scene of death on the footpath.

Gittany is joined by a detective and sits in a black armchair facing the pavement where the body of Miss Harnum is lying.

The trial in which Gittany has pleaded not guilty to murder is continuing before Justice Lucy McCallum.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
