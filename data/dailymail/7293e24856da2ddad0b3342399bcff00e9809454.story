Diego Simeone was on the verge of making history with Atletico Madrid before he and his side imploded to bitter local rivals Real in the Champions League final.

Simeone ran on to the pitch twice, either side of extra time, to confront referee Bjorn Kuipers and Raphael Varane as Atletico lost 4-1 at Benfica's Stadium of Light.

The La Liga champions looked like they were on course to win a maiden European crown when defender Diego Godin headed them in front before half-time.

However, Atletico's dreams were dashed when Sergio Ramos equalised late in second-half stoppage time.

Ramos' 
goal was much to the chargrin of Simeone, who ran on to the pitch at the 
end of the first-half of extra time to vent his annoyance at referee Kuipers.

The Argentinian was incensed by the five minutes of added time that the Dutchman allowed for Carlo Ancelotti's side to score in.

Simeone's frustrations grew as late goals from Gareth Bale, Marcelo and a Cristiano Ronaldo penalty gave Real victory.

Simeone, who is notorious for having a
 short fuse, lived up to his reputation as he stormed on to the pitch in
 a heated exchange with Varane after Ronaldo's goal.

The incident came amidst Los Blancos' celebrations when Varane kicked the ball in the Atletico manager's direction.

Rising high: Godin (centre) headed home in the first-half for Atletico against bitter city rivals Real

So close: Real goalkeeper Iker Casillas (second right) was unable to prevent Godin's header cross the line

Varane's actions were much to the disdain of Simeone who booted the ball back towards the France international before running onto the pitch to confront him.

This resulted in a melee of players and staff to come between the two before the match could be concluded as Real won a tenth European crown.

After the match, Simeone explained that he was upset with the 21-year-old for celebrating in front of the Atleti bench, hence his furious reaction.

'He's a great player and he has a great life ahead of him,' Simeone said. 'But it was just ugly. At 4-1 it was pointless to create that.'
