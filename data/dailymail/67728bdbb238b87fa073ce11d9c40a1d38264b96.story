A father mourning the loss of his one-year-old daughter, who was allegedly drowned by his wife last week in the family’s bathtub, made the heart-wrenching decision to take his second daughter, five, off of life support Monday.

Jose Humberto Lopez said that he hoped some good would come of Marian’s death, as he had chosen to donate her organs for transplant.

He told police he found his wife, 32-year-old Lorna Valle, pushing their two daughters underwater last Wednesday in a bath inside their Los Angeles home.

Heart-wrenching: Jose Humberto Lopez decided to take his five-year-old daughter off life support Monday

Lorna Valle (centre) was arrested on suspicion of killing her one-year-old daughter Lindsay (right) and five-year-old daughter Marian (left) who was taken off life support yesterday

One-year-old Lindsay was declared dead when fire-fighters arrived on the scene.

Mr Lopez said Monday with tears 
streaming down his face outside Children’s Hospital in Los Angeles: ‘I 
made a humanitarian decision to donate my daughter’s organs so another 
person can live.’

Officer Karen Rayner, a spokeswoman 
for the Los Angeles Police Department, told City News Service that 
Marian had died, ‘but I have not yet had that confirmed.’

Valle, was charged with murder and 
attempted murder Friday and is being held on $1.5million bail. If 
convicted, she could get 50 years to life in prison.

Police suspect that Valle ‘snapped’ when she decided to try to drown her 
daughters Marian, five, and Lindsay, one.

Valle
was stopped by her husband who returned to their south Los Angeles home
from the grocery store around 7.30am last Wednesday morning after going
to pick up juice and milk for his daughters.

Tragic: Both Lindsay (left) and Marian (right) were unconscious when police arrived on scene -Lindsay was declared dead at the scene and Marian was taken off life support Monday

When the father arrived in the house, neighbours heard screams of ‘My babies! My babies!’ and police were called.

Both girls were not breathing and unconscious when police arrived and found them in the bathroom of the family’s converted garage. They were taken to Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, and Marian remains there in extremely critical condition.

Witnesses said that 'the little one' was 'in really bad shape' and almost purple when police arrived.

'We believe she is responsible for what happened to these two children,' said Los Angeles police commander Andy Smith.

The family emigrated from Guatamala to California about ten years ago, and neighbours said that they were hard working and friendly.

Now questions are being raised about Lorna Valle’s mental state, and some say that she had appeared depressed in recent weeks.

‘A neighbour said she told her that if
anything happens to her, she would leave the girls to the father or to 
them,’ said Dina Ceballos.

Arrested: Though Lorna Valle did not have a history of mental illness, neighbours reported that she had seemed depressed recently

‘She was asking for psychological help and she didn't receive it. It's a sad story. It's a sad ending. She needs help.

Ms Ceballos was nearby at the time of the incident and heard the father scream ‘If I didn’t get out, my girls would still be alive!

'Why didn’t she kill herself instead of trying to kill my girls?’

Others also suspected mental issues, like neighbour Jennifer Houston who told The Los Angeles Times that the mother seemed ‘like she was disturbed’.

The name of the father has not been released, by another neighbour had good things to say about him.

‘He’s quiet. He’s the one who seems more adept,’ said Judy McCann.

‘He’s the one who had all his marbles.

‘She stays in the house. She never comes out.’

Because the police department found the scene so traumatic, the first responders from the police and fire departments are being offered counselling services to help them cope with what they saw.

'This is a tragic and horrific incident. Something no one likes to see,' said deputy police chief Pat Gannon.
