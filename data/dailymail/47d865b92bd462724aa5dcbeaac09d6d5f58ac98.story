Three missing suspected ISIS terrorists have given themselves up after officials in Turkey put them on a plane to the wrong French airport.

The men are understood to have been jailed by ISIS on suspicion of spying after expressing a desire to return to France when they grew disillusioned with the group's campaign of terror in Syria and Iraq.

Having escaped from their brutal captors, the men - who include the brother-in-law of Mohamed Merah, the man who murdered seven people at a Jewish school in Toulouse in March 2012 - handed themselves in at the Syrian border with Turkey.

But despite them having agreed to justice in France, Turkish authorities managed to bungle the extradition - failing to put the men on an agreed flight to Paris and instead sending them to Marseille without informing the French police, allowing the suspected terrorists to simply wander off on arrival.

Surrender: The three missing suspected ISIS terrorists gave themselves up at this village police station near Marseille after officials in Turkey put them on a plane to the wrong French airport

Having arrived in Marseille from Turkey on their still-valid passports, the men found there were no French police officers there to greet them - nor had the airport itself been informed of the situation.

This allowed the men to simply pass through customs without causing suspicion and disappear, causing much embarrassment to French officials who had triumphantly announced in advance that the suspected terrorists would be arrested within minutes of their arrival at Paris Orly airport.

Several hours after the men vanished, they once again handed themselves in - this time at a village police station the found after driving 105 miles north of Marseille.

Lawyers defending the men say they handed themselves in because they want prosecutors at any future trial to take their evidence seriously.

'The three men handed themselves in because they want to be listened to by the authorities,' lawyer Apollinaire Legros-Gimbert said, adding the men had been in touch with French authorities for several months before their return. 'They were stunned not to have been questioned yesterday.'

Embarrassingly for the government, the case has come at a time when France is already on high security alert after militant group Islamic State threatened French targets.

France has joined a U.S.-led campaign of air strikes, hitting Islamic State targets in Iraq last week.

The mix-up in understood to have occurred after the pilot of the Paris-bound aircraft refused to let the men board the plane due to their status as suspected terrorists.

Instead of reporting the problem, Turkish officials simply booked the men on to the next available France-bound flight - a passenger plane headed to Marseille, some 450 miles from Paris.

One aspect that made the mix-up even more embarrassing for French authorities is that they were forced to backtrack on earlier claims the men were already in custody - admitting not only had they not yet been arrested, they had now disappeared without trace.

French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said he had ordered an investigation of the case and said he would also travel shortly to Turkey to ensure the errors were not repeated.

An interior ministry official said the three men had long been under surveillance by security services. One of them, Imad Jebali, has already spent time in a French prison after being charged for links to a jihadist network in Iraq in 2007.

Another of the three, Abdelwaheb al-Baghdadi, is the brother-in-law of Mohamed Merah, who killed seven people including three Jewish children in Toulouse in March 2012 before police shot him dead.

Christian Etelin, a lawyer advising Baghdadi's wife, said the men had originally gone to Syria to live in a religious society. They had escaped Islamic State to hand themselves over to Turkish officials because they had been terrified by the 'fanaticism' there, he said.
