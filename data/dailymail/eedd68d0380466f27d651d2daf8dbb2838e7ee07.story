A teenager was arrested today over the alleged kidnap and murder of young mother Kirsty Treloar.

The 20-year-old alleged victim was abducted from her east London home shortly after 7am yesterday before being found dead in an abandoned car some 90 minutes later.

Officers involved in a major manhunt arrested a 19-year-old suspect at about 1pm in the Hackney area, Scotland Yard said.

Kidnapped: The body of Kirsty Treloar, 20, who just a month ago had given birth to a baby girl, was found in an abandoned car yesterday morning

The suspect remains in custody at an east London police station, officers said.

Her body was discovered with stab wounds at around 8.30am in a grey Fiat Stilo which was abandoned about a mile from her home in east London.

She was pronounced dead at the scene in Ryder Mews. It is understood police believe it to be a domestic incident.

Hurt: Siblings Dean and Gemma Treloar were also stabbed during the attack

A 22-year-old man and a 24-year-old woman - Ms Treloar's siblings Dean, 22, and Gemma, 24, - were also injured in the incident and were treated for stab wounds.

Mr Treloar remains in an east London hospital in a 'stable' condition. A month-old baby girl was also taken to hospital as a precaution.

Neighbours expressed disbelief as forensics officers examined both scenes which were cordoned off with police tape. A tarpaulin covered one of the ground-floor windows of Ms Treloar's home in Brownlow Road.

A man believed to be Ms Treloar's 
stepfather is understood to live at the same address. Neighbours said he
 was employed by Hackney Council.

Terry Tundervary, 58, a builder, said: 'They seemed to be a very friendly family. I used to say hello to the girl.

'If it's the girl I think it is, she's got a little baby.

'She
 was a pretty girl, a very normal girl, the whole family was very 
friendly although I didn't know their names. I just knew them to say 
hello to as neighbours do.

'I
 believe the girl's dad, he may have been her step-dad, came from the US
 or Canada. I think he was a binman for Hackney Borough Council.'

Retired couple Mary and David Ward, 
both in their 70s, said they were shocked to hear what had happened at 
the property so close to their home.

Mr Ward, 70, added: 'It's a terrible shock. We couldn't believe all this happened, it's a real tragedy.

'The area is pretty good really, we've lived here nearly 30 years and it's the first time anything like this has occurred.

'We
 have never had any trouble - we didn't know the family but the young 
girl seemed to be very nice when we saw her to say hello to.'

This is the latest in a string of tragedies over the Christmas and New Year period.

Ruby Love, who had three children, was hit over the head and strangled before being dumped in a London canal on Christmas Day.

Police officers on the scene yesterday after a girl, believed to be aged 15, was arrested over a murder in Luton

Three other people died after being attacked at New Year's Eve Parties.

A teenage girl was being held on suspicion of stabbing a middle-aged man to death at a house party.

He suffered a heart attack after being knifed at the party and died within an hour.

Detectives today arrested a girl believed to be aged around 15 on suspicion of carrying out the attack.

Police were initially unable to question many of the guests at the party because they were drunk.

Neighbours
 told how at 3am they heard 'loads of screaming' coming from the house 
party and then squads of police and a paramedic crew arrived.

One neighbour said a lot of teenagers and adults had attended the party.

'They were playing music throughout the night which wasn't too bad, nothing out of the ordinary,' she said.

'Then the music suddenly stopped and there was a lot of shouting and fighting.

'You could hear people fighting. Then there were these awful screams and people running from the house in a state.

'A group of girls were the first to come out and they bolted down an alleyway at the bottom of the road.'

Police had sealed of a large section of the quiet cul-de-sac as forensic teams worked in the house and back garden.
