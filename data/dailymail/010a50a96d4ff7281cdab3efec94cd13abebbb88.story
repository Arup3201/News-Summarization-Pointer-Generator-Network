Kate Winslet has said her two divorces have taught her children valuable life lessons - but not all parents would agree. 

Her comments sparked a heated debate on ITV's This Morning, with women with entirely opposing views battle it out over the question of whether divorce can ever be good for children.

The question has also been hotly discussed on online parenting forums since the star told Harper's Bazaar: 'I think it’s very important to teach your children to struggle on some level.'

Kate Winslet has spoke about how the bad points in her life, including her two divorces, have helped teach her kids about hardships

Mum-of-two, Sally Jones, said divorce should never be an option as it's so damaging for children. But mum-of-one, Alley Einstein, disagreed

The actress, 39,  has three children: Mia, 14, from her marriage to Jim Threapleton, Joe, 11, from her marriage to Sam Mendes and one-year-old, Bear, from her third husband Ned Rocknroll.

She spoke out in the March issue of Harper's Bazaar, which hit shelves today, saying: 'I would honestly say that I wouldn’t change a thing. Even all the bad bits.

'It doesn’t matter how ***** times have been, they all matter, because those things shape who you are.

'And if you don’t like who you are, well, then you’re ****** really, aren’t you?' 

Appearing on This Morning, mum-of-two, Sally Jones, slammed the star's views on divorce and referred to her statements as 'emotional incontinence'. 

‘She somehow thinks that just because she wants to go off with somebody else it doesn’t matter to anybody else – the children can come in my wake and I'm just going to say it's fine for them.

Marriage one: The Titanic actress married director Jim Threapleton in 1998. They had a daughter, Mia, before divorcing in 2001

'She’s got no idea how it’s going to affect them.'

But mother-of-one Alley Einstein, who joined Ms Jones on the sofa interjected.

‘Of course she has – she knows a child wants to see their mummy and daddy happy,' she said.

'My parents should have got divorced but they never did. Parents who live together and stay together because of their children are living a lie.

'They’re simply saying mummy and daddy are going to stay together for you but we really aren’t happy.

'Simply staying together for sake of children is wrong.'

But undeterred, Ms Jones continued: 'Plenty of marriages people go through a bad time – especially if don’t have army of nannies and gardeners.'

But she says rather than 'stick on a stiff upper lip' they opt for divorce.

'Many times my husband and I have wanted to strangle each other, ' she admitted. 

Marriage two: The actress next walked down the aisle with director Sam Mendes and had a son, Jo. They split in 2010

Marriage three: The star then tied the knot with Richard Branson's nephew Ned Rocknroll in 2012 and they welcomed a son, Bear, the following year

'But children long and long to see their parents together.

‘Kids have plenty of struggles – kids of happily married couples have struggles. There's no point making extra struggles.

But Ms Jones added: 'Obviously if there's violence or bullying – that's something different.'  

Parenting expert Noel Janis-Norton author of Calmer, Easier, Happier Parenting said the question of divorce is never black and white.

‘On the one hand children want their parents to stay together - unless it is a truly horrendous situation.

Parents who aired their views on parenting forum Netmums were not all as understanding of Kate's views

One daughter of divorced parents takes a stance against Kate's statements

‘Children want that dream of perfection', she told the MailOnline. ‘But in reality some families benefit from divorce.

‘The most troubled dysfunctional families I’ve seen in my career are the ones where biological parents are staying together for sake of children.

‘Children will never thank their parents for that.’ 

The star's interview created a backlash on parenting forum Netmums

Some Netmums users supported Kate Winslet's view

But parents who aired their views on parenting forum Netmums were not all as understanding.

'Unless it's an abusive relationship it's not a positive experience for children. How about teaching them to resolve problems etc? Children need to learn life's not always easy but there are many ways,' posted Emma.

Another mum, Kate wrote: 'No I don't think it is good or helpful to children at all. I wouldn't think that highly of someone who had been married to 3 men had a child each to each husband and been divorced 3 times. how is that a good example to her children?!'

'Is there a remote chance that this is anything other than self justifying nonsense?' wrote Faith.

Another netmum user Danni said: 'I don't think its fair to judge on different children with different fathers at all, but as someone who experienced my parents divorce when I was young I can say it didn't help at all and I completely disagree. But thats just my opinion.'

But alongside the criticism also came some support. 

One mother Jo posted: 'My children have a much better relationship with their father now we are divorced than they ever did when we were married. 

'Now he actually has to spend time with them doing things that he just left up to me before. I just wish he had been like this when we were together!'

Lisa Marie then added: I don't know that I would go so far as to say that divorce is a good thing for children. but in some cases it can be far better than if the parents stay together.' 

The full feature appears in March issue of Harper's Bazaar UK, which is on sale 3 February. It is also available as a digital edition.
