House Speaker John Boehner lashed out at the Obama administration on Wednesday for issuing the latest in a long series of Affordable Care Act delays, giving prospective enrollees another half-month to signup for insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act website, healthcare.gov.

'What the hell is this, a joke?' an incredulous Boehner said during his regular Wednesday press conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C.

He said the White House has been reduced to treating the law's March 31 regulatory deadline as a formality – 'another deadline rendered meaningless,'  he mocked – allowing weeks of extra time for Americans who claim they tried in earnest to sign up before the deadline.

'The dates are the dates, and the law is the law,' Boehner said, answering a reporter's question about why Americans shouldn't have more time.

'The president doesn't have the authority to change the law whenever he wants, which he continues to do.'

Not impressed: House Speaker John Boehner castigated the White House for the latest in a long series of administrative changes to the 2009 Affordable Care Act during its rocky implementation

'No, sir': Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told the House Ways and Means Committee on March 12 that Obamacare's March 31 deadline would not be extended, but the administration has done just that

March 31 was supposed to be a drop-dead, red-line date, creating a frenzy of activity among health insurance enrollment counselors in anticipation of financial penalties for those who don't comply

zzzzzzzzzz

'Why don’t they just say, "We've moved the date to April 15"? Because that's in effect what they’ve done,' Boehner said.

'The law says that enrollment stops at the end of March. That’s what the law says,' he said later, sticking up for Congress' part in the four-year-long Obamacare saga.

'I've got to live by the law. You've got to live by the law. The American people have got to live by the law. And guess what? The president needs to live by the law as well.' 

A source inside the Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services who is familiar with Tuesday's decision 
told MailOnline that the agency has not determined what the new cutoff 
date will be.

But the 
insider said that CMS was not likely to fix April 15 as the revised 
zero-hour since it would coincide with the Internal Revenue Service's 
deadline for individual income tax filings.

Cries of hypocrisy rang out Tuesday night when the news was leaked, with some online commentators comparing the move to leaving Election Day polls open for extra days in order to accommodate people who claim they meant to vote on time.

'If Obamacare was a good law, the president wouldn't need to break the law nearly every week to implement it,' texas Sen. John Cornyn said.

'Rather than issue yet another extension, the president should admit his law does not work and waive Obamacare for all Americans. Once it’s repealed, we can work together to put health care reforms in place that empower, not limit, the consumer, provide more choices, and expand access to better care.'

Health and Human Services Department spokeswoman Joanne Peters insisted in a schizophrenic statement that “[o]pen enrollment ends March 31,' but then added that HHS is 'experiencing a surge in demand and are making sure that we will be ready to help consumers who may be in line by the deadline to complete enrollment – either online or over the phone.'

Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, in California for the state party's spring conference, mocked the latest delay and predicted it would have political consequences in November

White House spokesman Jay Carney hinted at the development last Friday, telling reporters during a daily briefing that the administration wanted ensure that 'people who are already in line can finish their enrollment.'

An 11th-hour delay was treated as outside the realm of possibility just two weeks ago, however.

During a March 12 congressional 
hearing, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told Texas Republican Rep. 
Kevin Brady that there would be no such extensions.

'Are you going to delay the open enrollment beyond March 31?' Brady asked.

'No, sir,' she replied.

On the same day, Julie Bataille, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services – the agency charged with implementing the Obamacare law – told reporters that 'we have no plans to extend the open enrollment period' that began disastrously on October 1.

'In fact, we don't actually have the statutory authority to extend the open enrollment period in 2014,' she said.

Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services spokeswoman Julie Bataille told reporters two weeks ago that HHS doesn't have the legal authority to budge the open-enrollment zero hour into April

During the March 12 hearing before the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee, chairman Dave Camp asked Sebelius if she agreed with that assessment.

'I haven’t seen their statements,' she replied, despite having been on the conference call, 'but there is no delay beyond March 31.'

The Obama administration leaked the latest tactical shift after 8:00 p.m. Tuesday night while President Barack Obama was sleeping in Brussels, Belgium, and first lady Michelle Obama was beginning the day in Chengdu, China during part of a three-city tour.

Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus leapt into the political opening immediately, releasing a dismissive statement.

'Another day, another Obamacare delay from the same Obama administration that won't work with Republicans to help Americans suffering from the unintended consequences of the Democrats' failed healthcare law,' he said

'Democrats in leadership may say they are doubling down on Obamacare but you have to wonder how many more unilateral delays their candidates running in 2014 can withstand.'

The White House has struggled to enroll the 7 million Americans Sebelius has put forward as a goal.

'I think success looks like at least 7 million people having signed up by the end of March 2014,' Sebelius said during an NBC News interview in September 2013.

Later, the administration ratcheted that number down to 6 million, and lower still.

If the nebulous targets were a series of goalpost-moving exercises, Tuesday's move will be seen as a sudden extension of Obamacare's game clock.

The Washington Post reported that the extension past March 31 'will rely on an honor system,' requiring users only to check a blue box on the federal government's health insurance enrollment website to indicate that they made good-faith efforts to meet the original deadline.

'The government will not try to determine whether the person is telling the truth,' said the Post.

Some states that are running their own online insurance marketplaces are expected to make similar arrangements, but others will not.

Americans who aren't insured by the final, absolute deadline – a date that remains uncertain despite four years of planning and regulating – will face penalties in the form of new taxes on their income, unless that, too, is not strictly enforced.

Boehner lashed out at Barack Obama for treating the March 31 deadline, a date prescribed by the Obamacare law's text, as a moveable suggestion instead of a red line

Once the Obama administration's open enrollment period is finally in the rear-view mirror, it will likely have to answer the thorny question of how many enrollees have actually begun their coverage by paying first-month's premiums.

The White House has repeatedly declined to release that information, claiming the administration hasn't collected those statistics.

But Rep. Camp and Ways and Means health subcommittee chairman Rep. Kevin Brady lobbed a broadside at Sebelius on Tuesday, saying they have 'new evidence' proving the contrary is true.

“New evidence obtained by the Committee strongly suggests that the Administration knows who has enrolled and paid their first month’s premium,' the two Republican lawmakers wrote to the HHS secretary.

'In fact, there is specific information about who has paid their premium that Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is collecting and using to make payments to insurers.'

'We have recently obtained information that suggests your most recent testimony before the Ways and Means Committee was at best evasive and perhaps misleading,' they charged, explaining that '[i]nsurers are submitting information to CMS about who has effectuated their enrollment, i.e., who has paid their premium.'

'Please provide this information in its most updated form immediately.'

Just check a box and say you tried to sign up for Obamacare before March 31, and the system will give you a few more weeks
