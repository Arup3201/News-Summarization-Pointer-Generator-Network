Caesar's palace: Human beings are surprisingly bad at spotting deception - perhaps because we do so much of it - but one group are VERY good... liars themselves

Human beings are surprisingly bad at spotting deception - perhaps because we do so much of it - but one group are VERY good... liars themselves.

In a speaking test, liars were able to spot other liars far more accurately than people who told the truth - which might explain why poker players are good at both.

Oddly, the ability ISN'T related to IQ or emotional intelligence - the ability to lie is a separate thing.

University College, London, researchers graded 51 volunteers simultaneously on their abilities to tell lies - and spot other liars.

Graphing the results, it's clear that people who are good at TELLING lies can also spot them far more easily than 'normal' people.

There are clear 'tells' that people are lying - such as the fact that they tend to take longer to start talking, which the research confirmed, but liars pick up on these more easily.

'It is not uncommon to hearof ‘poachers turned gamekeepers’, such as infamous confidence-trickster,Frank AbagnaleJr., who is now an FBI financial fraud consultant,' say the researchers.

What is more mystifying is that the liars and non-liars are of similar intelligence level - ie it's not a simple difference in intellectual ability.

The ability to deceive seems to be separate - although it's not clear whether people are born with it, or learn it.

'A significant relationship was found between the deception-related 
abilities; those who could accurately detect a lie were able to produce 
statements that others found difficult to classify as deceptive or 
truthful,' say the researchers.

'Furthermore, neither ability was related to measures of 
intelligence or emotional ability. We, therefore, suggest the existence 
of an underlying deception-general ability that varies across 
individuals.'
