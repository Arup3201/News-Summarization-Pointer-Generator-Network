Is this the future of boxing?

Jay Z was joined by a host of celebrities as he celebrated hosting his first show as a promoter at Madison Square Garden in New York on Friday night.

With a mid-show performance from rapper Fabolous and appearances from pop star Rihanna and actor Jake Gyllenhaal, there was more than a touch of glamour and razzmatazz.

Between the ropes, Dusty Hernandez-Harrison outpointed Tommy Rainone in the main event.

And just hours earlier, Jay Z made his first marquee signing as super middleweight world champion Andre Ward joined his Roc Nation Sports stable.  

Jay Z's wife Beyonce missed the event as the star studded crowd watched on as welterweight Hernandez-Harrison protected his undefeated record.

‘I think I was made for situations like this,’ Hernandez-Harrison said. ‘The fight itself, I started to get better and better.

‘I wanted the knockout bad. I looked for it too much in the 10th round. Other than that, I’m happy.’ 

Before Ward put pen to paper, Jay Z had struggled to tempt one of boxing's big names to join his venture. 

Last August, his chief operating officer David Itskowitch travelled to Puerto Rica with a cheque for $1,904,840 to bid for a middleweight world title fight between champion Peter Quillin and Matt Korobov.

Roc Nation Sports won the purse bid, offering $700,000 more than the next highest bid from Golden Boy.

But Quillin never did fight Korobov, instead opting to vacate his title and wave goodbye to a $1.4m pay day.

Jay Z was visibly pleased with the way in which his first boxing event panned out  

Roc Nation Sports also reportedly offered Deontay Wilder $2m for his upcoming fight with WBC heavyweight belt holder Bermane Stiverne as part of a five-fight deal, only to remove the offer from the table after receiving no response. 

Keith Thurman, meanwhile, rejected a multi-fight deal worth $6m, telling ESPN: 'Jay Z's company is a young company. I haven't seen them make guys money yet in boxing.

'I want to see [Jay Z] do something with another fighter before I follow. I don't want to fly on the first airplane.' 

But Ward has taken the plunge, tweeting on Friday: 'It's official! Happy to be part of the Roc Nation family.'

The boxer has been out of action for 14 months due to disputes with his former promoter but is widely considered one of the best pound-for-pound fighters in the world.

He was the last man to beat British star Carl Froch when they met in the final of the Super Six in Atlantic City in 2011.

Ward told ESPN: 'I wholeheartedly believe in Roc Nation Sports and I just believe that they have the vision and the power and resources to carry their vision out.'
