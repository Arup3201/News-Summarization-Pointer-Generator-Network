Anything for little Oliver... Professionals are 
using their financial muscle to buy homes - even second homes - close to over-subscribed schools

Cunning and underhand tactics used by wealthy parents to get their children into top state schools have been laid bare in a report.

Professionals are using their financial muscle to buy homes – even second homes – near over-subscribed schools, while others are resorting to breaking the law by setting up fake addresses in desirable catchment areas.

The Parent Power survey commissioned by education charity the Sutton Trust found a third of professional parents deliberately moved to an area with good schools, while one in five moved to the catchment area of a specific school.

Astonishingly one in 20 could afford to buy a second home just to use the address when applying. This was more than double the two per cent among parents in general.

Six per cent – double the average – admitted using a relative’s address on application forms. And one in ten said they had started going to church to get their child into a faith school compared with one in 16 among parents in general.

And one in 20 - five per cent - bought a second home to use the address when applying for a place at a specific school. This was more than double the two per cent among parents in general.

The release of the survey comes two days after the Chief Inspector of Schools attracted criticism by saying grammar schools are ‘stuffed full of middle-class kids’.

Sir Michael Wilshaw dismissed the argument they help social mobility on the grounds that better-off families are forcing out poorer pupils by snapping up properties in the area or paying tutors to help their children through the 11-plus entry test.

Supporters say it is the lack of grammar schools in England - just 164 remain - that is creating the intense competition for places.

They argue opening more would deliver the benefits grammar schools achieved before Labour politicians started their demise.

The Parent Power report, commissioned by the Sutton Trust education charity and involving 1,173 parents of five to 16-year-olds, found a third of professional parents deliberately moved to an area with good schools and one in five to the catchment area of a specific school.

Around two-fifths are ‘hyperchoosers’ who use five sources of information, such as Ofsted reports and exam results, when picking a school. Among low-income families the figure is just 13 per cent.

Professional parents were also more likely to pay for weekly music, drama or sporting lessons and activities outside school.

Over two-thirds pay for extra-curricular activities, compared to around half of working class parents and less than a third on the lowest incomes.

No darling, that's an A-flat: Professional parents were also more likely to pay for weekly music, drama or sporting lessons and activities outside school, found the survey by the education charity The Sutton Trust

The Sutton Trust called for reforms including random allocation of school places through ballots and free transport for poor pupils to give them access to a choice of schools.

Chairman Sir Peter Lampl said: ‘This research suggests that those with money actively choose to live near good schools, employ tutors and ensure their children have extra lessons and enrichment activities that are often too expensive for other families to afford.

‘This provides a significant advantage in school choice and in developing the cultural capital that is so important to social mobility and later success.

‘Education is about more than what happens at school and providing a more level playing field in school choice and out-of-school activities is essential if every child is to achieve his or her potential.’

However, report co-author Professor Becky Francis, of King’s College London, added: ‘Our findings also demonstrate the extent to which some working class parents are enacting “informed choice” and policymakers may also learn from their practices.’
