Less than two weeks after The Simpsons producer dismissed a theory that Homer has been in a coma for two decades, an astronomer has come up with another conspiracy: Springfield is in the southern hemisphere.

In the latest episode of the show, SpaceX's Elon Musk guest starred and spends time at the Simpsons' home. 

At one point he stands by the dining room window, looking out at the night sky as the family sits behind him eating dinner.

The waxing crescent moon is important to note, according to astronomer Phil Plait.

But in The Simpsons' scene with Musk, the tips of the waxing crescent moon face right - how they would in the southern hemisphere. 

'This is the moment that changed everything for me. The frozen moment of time when I realized that for 22 years, The Simpsons has been lying to us,' Plait wrote on Slate.

Plait, 50, does not reveal, however, why he believes the show to be lying for only 22 years of its 26-year span on television. 

But the fact that there are places called Springfield in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, makes this theory entirely possible.

Two weeks ago fans of the satirical cartoon proposed that Homer Simpson never awoke from a coma he fell into during an episode in 1993 and that everything that occurred on the series after that happened inside Homer's head.

While seeming outlandish on the surface, the theory is gaining a lot of traction in online The Simpsons forums, with even the most devout of followers declaring they believe it.

The theory lays claim to why the characters never age, and how the show moved from mundane episodes in the early '90s, such as Bart cheating on an IQ test, to plots that saw Mr. Burns capturing the Loch Ness Monster.

But producer Al Jean said that the coma theory can be stashed in the 'intriguing but false file'.

Jean said the theory, and a similar one that claims Bart was killed in an episode that never aired, is false, according to TMZ.

He said: 'It would mean back in 1993 we would presume the show was going on for years and years more and right before we left, threw this hidden monkey wrench in for all our successors.

'I'm afraid it goes with the 'Dead Bart' episode in the intriguing but false file.'
