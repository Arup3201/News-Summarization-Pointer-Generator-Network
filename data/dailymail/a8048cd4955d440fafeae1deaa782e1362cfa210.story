He could easily have kept the stolen goods he found dumped on a busy sidewalk.

But perhaps knowing what it's like to lose it all, this homeless man tracked down the distraught owner of the precious items and returned everything he found.

Overwhelmed by the random act of kindess, the woman - an Obstetrics and Gynecology resident - and her husband posted a picture of the Good Samaritan on reddit.com which has now reaped its own rewards.

Grateful: Reddit user 'anitasanger' posted this picture of a homeless man who returned some of her stolen property days after it went missing

Reddit user anitasanger's 2010 Dodge Charger was broken into on Tuesday night on East 15th Street in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

The bandit stole a large purple Vera Bradley work bag, and most of its contents, including a wallet, iPad, iPhone, physician work papers and hospital ID badges for OSU Medical Center and St. Francis, according to the police report.

The
thief had also rifled through the glovebox before fleeing, leaving the
screwdriver he or she used to break into the car on the vehicle's floorboard.

But the woman, fearing she had lost everything, was stunned when she was contacted by a homeless man who found her important paperwork.

He tracked her down because her name was written on most of the documents.

'This homeless man just found a bunch of my wife's stolen property strewn all over downtown Tulsa,' user anitasanger posted on reddit.

'He took the time to gather it all up in the rain and called us for retrieval. I just want to recognize him as an awesome human being.'

The user, who has not been identified, hasn't responded to MailOnline's request for comment.

The
post triggered an overwhelming response on reddit, with more than 1400 
comments relating to the man's random act of kindness.

The couple said they were grateful for the rough sleeper's compassion and gave him a $15 cash reward - a sum which was roundly criticized by reddit users.

'I realize that $15 isn't much, and it may appear like we slighted the 
guy. Yes we had some luxury items an ipad and an iphone that were 
stolen. The ipad was a christmas gift from my father,' the user wrote.

'Residency is 
pretty tough and we don't have much money left over each month. What 
cash we had was in my wife's wallet, which was stolen.

'The reason we 
even had $15 cash was because we pulled it from the sock drawer to 
replace my wife's driver's license. The DMV only accepts checks, which 
we don't have, or cash.

'It was literally all we had, so we gave it to 
the nice man. I wasn't trying to be a hero by giving the guy a few 
dollars, that's why I didn't even mention it in the title. The only 
reason I mentioned it, is because people asked if we did anything for 
the guy. I am grateful for his humanity and compassion.'

Many of the users commented the couple should donate a substantial sum to Tulsa Day Center for the Homeless, a shelter for people who sleep rough where the man was known to frequent.

Perhaps proving that karma exists, a number of people made small donations to the center, and posted the news to reddit.

'Donate guys. This guy and the others deserve to be kept warm and fed this winter,' one user wrote.

'Just for this action, a guy with nothing gave back everything her could to these two who have a damn site more than he does. He deserves all the karma that exists on reddit.'

Tulsa Day Center for the Homeless declined to comment.
