One of Britain’s most crooked company bosses has been jailed for nearly five years for masterminding a £6m scam to fund a lavish lifestyle.

Demitris Bains, 51, and his gang set up dozens of bogus companies in which they bought goods on credit, then re-sold them without paying the suppliers.

Bains would then collapse the firms when creditors began demanding their money back, often leaving them bankrupt.

Southwark Crown Court heard the ¿long firm¿ fraud went on to spark one of the biggest ever investigations

His sister Kiran Dillon, 45, used a series of aliases to hide her identity as she secured more funds for the gang’s other fake companies, even targeting the very same traders who had just been scammed.

The group, who traded as construction companies based in the East Midlands, splurged creditors’ cash on bottles of vintage wine, champagne and the latest hi-tech gadgets.

Bains used cash from the scam to pay for helicopter lessons and build himself an indoor swimming pool.

Southwark Crown Court heard the ‘long firm’ fraud went on to spark one of the biggest ever probes by the Department of Trade and Industry.

Bains was jailed for four years and nine months while Dillon was given four years and three months after they admitted fraud charges.

Prosecutor Gerard Pounder said that Bains was also able to build houses without spending a single penny and employ labour free of cost as a result of the fraud.

‘Some of the fraudulent companies that were set up never made any purchases at all’, Mr Pounder said.

‘Irrelevant goods were ordered, for example alcohol, and top of the range mobile phones from Vodafone.

‘It was a cynical scheme to steal goods from small trading creditors.’

The court heard the gang’s bogus companies included Milli-Style Limited, Britannia (Construction Supplies) Ltd, Fabricat (Nottingham) Ltd, Sharpe Developments Ltd, Woodpro Limited, All Aspects Construction Ltd, Blue Chip Innovations Ltd, RMD Imports Ltd and Real Estate Midland Ltd.

Mr Pounder added that Real Estate Midland alone racked up debts of over £1m before it was wound up when creditors demanded their money back.

More firms were shut down by Bains when they were chased up by suspicious suppliers attempting to recoup their losses, before administrators wrote off the debts.

The court heard that the scam, which took place between 1998 and 2005, reached its peak in 2004 when RMD Imports crashed with debts of over £500,000.

Sentencing, Judge Jeffrey Pegden QC said: ‘You have all been involved in a very significant long term fraud in the Midlands, which was run by you Demitris Bains and your sister Kiran Dillon.

‘You used a number of companies as vehicles for fraudulent trading.

‘Those companies pretended to be legitimate and they persuaded trade suppliers to grant trade facilities in order to obtain goods and material on account.

‘Many, many creditors were left completely unpaid and were often smaller trade creditors, in some cases becoming bankrupt.

‘A serious aggravating feature in this case is that many of the already defrauded trade suppliers were re-targeted by the next company in line’.

Bains was jailed for four years and nine months, while his sister Dillon was jailed for four years and three months.

Both were also disqualified from acting as a company director for 12 years.

Simon Ludgate, 47, who fraudulently named his wife as the company director of Real Estate Midland because he had been declared bankrupt, was jailed for three years and three months.

Calvin Harris, 51, was also jailed for three years and three months and disqualified from acting as a company director for ten years.

Eric Harris, 71, was caged for two years and six months.

Sukhi Samrai, 47, was handed a 21-month prison sentence suspended for 18 months, while Philip Williams, 54, was given a two-year sentence suspended for two years and ordered to pay £2,500 in compensation.

Bains, of South Parade, Nottingham, admitted conspiracy to defraud.

Dillon, of Fen Lane in Balderton, Newark, admitted nine counts of fraudulent trading.

Ludgate, of Exefold, Mansfield Woodhouse, Nottingham, and Calvin Harris, of no fixed address, both admitted fraudulent trading and acting as a company director while disqualified.

Samrai, of Pocklingtons Walk, Leicester; Williams, of Huthwaite Road in Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottingham; and Eric Harris, of Apollo Drive, Hempshill Vale, Nottingham, all denied a single count of fraudulent trading and were found guilty at trial.
