It’s a familiar feeling of panic – that moment you realise you’ve spilt the entire contents of your coffee cup all over computer.

Right now in offices up and down the country, thousands of people are holding their heads in horror and scrabbling for anything dry to limit the damage.

Now, one inventor from Connecticut has come up with a remarkably simple solution to put an end to the hazards of drinking while working.

A new cup holder has been invented to stop office workers spilling drinks on their keyboards. The special device looks like something that might be found in a car and clamps on to the side of a desk to hold a drink

The contraption, named the Vector Cupholder, was invented by Cliff Thier after some of his friends broke their computers or burned themselves when spilling their drinks.

The £30 gadget can hold any size drinks from small plastic cups all the way up to a large takeaway container, pint glass, and a thermos.

Because the centre of gravity of the beverage has been moved, it makes it almost impossible to knock over.

The Vector cupholder is made of a solid aluminum and clamps to tables, desks and trays up to 1.5 inches in thickness.

The £30 device has the ability to support a variety of containers and mugs up to three inches in diameter.

It can also support paper and plastic cups,  thermos bottles and even the odd cup you get on airplanes.

Because the centre of gravity of the beverage has been moved - up to the container's rim - it makes it almost impossible to knock over.

Mr Thier drew up a series of designs and built a prototype before putting it on a crowd funding website Kickstarter to raise money for the manufacturing process.

He aimed to raise £1,500 but was given a total of £7,000 and he is now manufacturing the handy device.

The 52-year-old said: ‘I know people who have burned themselves and fried their computers when they've knocked over a drink.

‘I started thinking about the problem as we are more frequently working alongside a tall drink whether at home, work, a classroom, on the road or in a cafe or hotel.

‘I collected and took the measurements of
 every cup I could get from cafes and sketched out different approaches 
before making several prototypes and then a final design.

Mr Their said Vector Cup will hold up to 900 ml as well as most thermoses and porcelain cups up to 3 inches in diameter.

‘It is ideal for everyone who works with a computer or other electronic device who doesn't want to spend hundreds replacing it,’ he said.

‘Also, getting the beverage container off the table frees up more room on the desk.’
