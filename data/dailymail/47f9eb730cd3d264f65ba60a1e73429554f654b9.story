Former Health Secretary Andrew Lansley, pictured here in Downing Street, could walk to work in 15 minutes - yet still claims expenses for hotel stays

House of Commons Leader Andrew Lansley claimed £6,000 in expenses for hotel stays in London despite owning a flat just a short walk from Parliament, it emerged today.

Official records show the Tory Cabinet minister declared dozens of overnight stays in the Capital paid for by the taxpayer while having a £1million Georgian home in upmarket Pimlico.

That is just a mile from Parliament, meaning the former Health Secretary - who earns a ministerial salary of £134,565 - could walk there in 15 minutes.

Mr Lansley's constituency home near Royston, South Cambridgeshire, is also just a 50-minute train ride away from London, the Sunday Mirror reported.

According to Parliamentary records, Mr Lansley has not rented out his Pimlico property because he has not declared any rental income from it on the Register of Members ­Financial Interests.

It is believed one family member lives there - but that the flat has more than one bedroom.

Despite this, the Independent Parliamentary Standards 
Authority has revealed Mr Lansley claimed £4,978 on hotel stays between April 
2012 and March this year and £972 in the first three months of this financial year.

IPSA rules allow MPs to claim £150 per 
night for hotels in London and £120 for those ­elsewhere in the country –
 with breakfast paid for if the stays are within the capped limits.

The Sunday Mirror reported that Latest Land Registry records show he and his second wife Sally paid £270,000 for the London home in December 2000 and that they have a mortgage.

The couple also have shares in a company owning the freehold for the building.

Mr Lansley has also received expenses for mortgage interest and utility bills for a flat in London, although records do not reveal whether the flat he claimed for was the one in Pimlico.

Matthew Sinclair, chief ­executive of 
the TaxPayers' ­Alliance, said: 'MPs do need to get the best deal that 
they can for taxpayers when making use of accommodation in London.

'Taxpayers will be left wondering why Mr Lansley needs a hotel if he already has ­accommodation in the city. Constant use of pricey hotel rooms is poor value for those who have to the bill. MPs should only check in as a last resort.'

It is not the first time questions have been raised about Mr Lansley's expenses.

In 2009, as shadow health secretary he spent £4,000 he claimed back renovating a thatched Tudor country cottage - and sold it shortly afterwards.

He redecorated with premium paint in some rooms at a cost of £2,000 and spent more than £500 having the driveway re-shingled.

He is then said to have 'flipped' his expenses to a Georgian flat in London and claimed for thousands of pounds in furnishings, including a Laura Ashley sofa.

Mr Lansley has
 a longstanding relationship with David Cameron, having been his boss 
when the Prime Minister took his first political job in the Conservative
 research department

But he was dumped by Mr Cameron as Health Secretary last year after a barrage of criticism.

A statement from Mr Lansley's office issued to the Sunday Mirror said: 'On the point about the London flat, I can confirm that this does not appear on the Register because it is ­occupied by Mr Lansley's family and thus he does not derive any net income from this.'
