The family of a woman who went missing after saying she was going shopping in her home town have been told by police she has been found in Mexico.

But relatives of Sally Hann, 55, have been left worrying if she is safe and planning to come home at all after police said data protection laws meant they cannot give the family any more information.

Her husband Keith contacted police on the evening of October 25 after the mother-of-four failed to return to their home in Chatham, Kent.

Sally Hann's family were told only last week that she boarded a plane at Gatwick on October 29 and flew to Cancun in Mexico (file picture of Cancun International Airport)

She had told him she was going shopping in the local town centre but did not come home.

Four days later the family were told by police that Sally had been found safe and well and that she would contact them in three weeks.

But officers said they could not give them any more details - not even where she was.

It was only some time later, last week on November 20, the family were finally told she had boarded a plane at Gatwick on October 29 and flown to Cancun in Mexico.

Her daughter Kirsty Fraser said she is 'worried about her state of mind' because she suffers from depression.

She said when the family asked police questions about her whereabouts, they were told officers could not tell them due to data protection laws.

Ms Fraser said her mother had left her mobile phone at home and her disappearance was 'out of character'.

She said she was 'going out of her mind' with worry and that 'nothing had happened at home' to give her mother a reason to leave.

She said: 'I’m assuming she’s on her own; I’m just worried about her state of mind because she has depression and other things.'

Mrs Hann used to work as a care assistant, but had been off work sick for two years.

Ms Fraser appealed to her mother: 'No one’s angry with you, no one’s upset. We just want to hear from you.'

Mrs Hann had mentioned travelling to Mexico before she disappeared, but told family she wanted to go next year.

A Kent Police spokesman said: 'Kent Police received a report of a missing adult woman on October 25. Inquiries were made and officers located the woman and ensured she was safe and well.

'In line with the woman's wishes no further information of her whereabouts was disclosed. We are no longer treating her as a missing person.'
