When Natasha Giggs was photographed kissing and cuddling her estranged husband Rhodri this week, many assumed the couple were back together.

But the Celebrity Big Brother star, 29, insists they aren't a couple, but are building a friendship for the sake of the children.

Speaking on This Morning today, Natasha spoke of her regrets over her eight-year affair with brother-in-law Ryan, 38, and her hopes that Rhodri, 34, will be able to trust her again.

Setting the record straight: Natasha Giggs spoke about her eight year affair with brother-in-law Ryan on This Morning

Referring to photos taken of them in a Bolton park this week, she said: 'The pictures are a bit misleading. We've been speaking for a long time. We've spent a lot of time together over the past few months.

'We both want to move on it from it. We both want to move on a friendship.

'Nobody is saying we're going to get back together. We're working on things for our children.

'In an ideal world, we will be together, we will be a family again. Whether or not we'll get over it, time will tell.'

Natasha admitted the pair had been trying to work through their problems since they split in June in the aftermath of her confession.

She insisted: 'Rhodri can trust me. That's what we're working on now. Its a huge thing to get over. If we do get back together is because we want to be together and we can 100 per cent trust each other...

'I love Rhodri. People have affairs for various different reasons. I do love Rhodri and I've always loved Rhodri.'

But when quizzed by This Morning host Ruth Langsford why she fled to Spain the day she sold her story instead of tell her husband face-to-face, Natasha admitted she was scared.

She explained: 'Rhodri and I had a really fiery relationship. I honestly thought he was going to kill me.

'It's one of my biggest regrets. I wish I had told him myself.'

Stern words: This Morning agony aunt Denise Robertson told Natasha she didn't believe she had fully realised the consequences of her actions

Natasha had already had a brief romance with Ryan - while he was dating now-wife Stacey - when she first met Rhodri in 2003.

Despite her sleeping with the Premiership footballer on and off during an eight year period, she pointed out that there was a three year period they didn't see each other.

But she ended up meeting Ryan during a night out in 2010 - just two months before she wed Rhodri in Las Vegas.

She said: 'Nothing had happened with us for a good three years beforehand. We bumped into each other on a night out and it just happened.

'I don't expect sympathy. Nobody will ever think of me for anything else except what I did. I've always held my hands up. It wasn't just me. I do feel like a lot of the stick that comes my way...

'I wasn't the only person involved.'

When
asked what she thought of Ryan's wife Stacey - who she was involved in a
slanging match with in a Manchester street in November - Natasha 
insisted she didn't judge her for forgiving the Manchester United star.

She said: 'I can't really say anything to her apart from what happened. I can't judge her for staying with him.

'I had four conversations with her during our (Rhodri and my) eight year relationship. We didn't really socialise together.'

Despite a Twitter row with Imogen Thomas - another woman alleged to have had an affair with Ryan - Natasha insists she actually felt sorry for the Welsh model.

Former Miss Wales Imogen was banned from
speaking about her six-month fling with Ryan after he got d a court 
injunction to silence her.

Sympathy: Natasha said she felt sorry for Imogen Thomas, who was wrongly labelled a blackmailer by Ryan

Last month, the High Court found Ryan had withdrawn his previous claim that suggested Imogen had tried to blackmail him.

The judge accepted Imogen did not ask Ryan for Â£100,000 to buy her silence over their affair.

Speaking today, Natasha said: 'I have absolutely no problem with her. It was unfair the way she was treated. To be publicly labelled a blackmailer.'

She insisted the only reason she hit back at Imogen on Twitter was because the model had started writing things about her first: 'I've never mentioned her, I've never tweeted on her and I felt there was no reason for her to say anything about me.'

Natasha vehemently denied This Morning agony aunt Denise Robertson's accusations that she didn't fully understand the fall-out of her affair.

She insisted: 'I've lived through this the past six months. Its easy for people outside to say that. Unless you're living through it you don't know what's going on.'

Natasha's Television appearance came after she denied tabloid claims she slept with a barber on holiday last summer.

Although single at the time following
her split from Rhodri, the Celebrity Big Brother star has denied having
sex with Graham Griffiths.

Denial: Natasha hit out at Griffiths' claims this morning on her Twitter page, insisting she didn't sleep with him

The 23-year-old barber, from Somerset, alleged he had slept with the brunette during a holiday in Ayia Napa last August.

Griffiths
told The Sun: 'I only knew her for three nights and I slept with her 
every one. She wore me out - she let me do everything with her and I 
couldn't help myself.

'Natasha's a man-eater and I think the only chance of their marriage working is if Rhodri keeps her locked up.'

She wrote on Twitter this morning: 'Pathetic! Last August as a single girl on holiday... With no sex involved. Sad little boy.'

Clearly supporting his wife, Salford 
City F.C. manager Rhodri - who has now called off plans to divorce her -
retweeted her comment on his Twitter page this morning.

She later added: 'If someone wants to
cash in on what's goin' on around me that's fine, it's hardly news! I 
don't really care tbh... Send him his chq n get it over with! I am a 
single girl at the end of the day.... There's obviously not much else 
goin on in the world at the mo!!'

Natasha's
holiday to Cyprus came two months after she confessed her affair with 
her brother-in-law to Rhodri in an emotional letter - written before she
fled to Spain with their son Louis, five.

Sticking by her man: Stacey Giggs has continued her marriage to husband Ryan, despite the revelations

She decided to come clean two months 
after Ryan's alleged six-month affair with Welsh model Imogen Thomas had
been revealed, despite the footballer getting an injunction on the 
latter.

Last weekend, 
Rhodri finally broke his silence over the affair and admitted his 
brother was yet to apologise to him for the betrayal.

He revealed he hadn't spoken to the Manchester United player since a short conversation last July.

Rhodri told The Sun: 'Ryan's a great footballer, but he is nothing as a man. Natasha was my whole life and he was supposed to be the closest person to me.

'He wasn't sorry. He said it was about the sex, nothing more than that, which was nice of him.'

Meanwhile, Rhodri and Natasha ended up in a Twitter row with Jade Goody's widower Jack Tweed.

After seeing photos of the reunited 
couple, Tweed, 24, wrote on his micro-blogging page: 'How has Giggs' 
brother taken her back after an 8 year affair. One word come to mind. 
#mug.'

In response, Natasha wrote: 'Of all the people I would've thought u would not believe everything u read #mug #jogon.'

And
Rhodri added: 'Mug.... Hopefully we bump into each other then we'll see
who the mug is...little f***ot #peopleinglasshouseswhoareyoubytheway??'

Tweed then replied: 'Just picture ur brother hangin out the back of ur bird every time u are #whosshethinkinabout.'

The
crude response then prompted Natasha to tweet: 'What a little rat u 
r.... #nomark what's up? Not been in the papers for a while?? Get a 
grip!'
