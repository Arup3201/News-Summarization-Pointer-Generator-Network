Boris Becker was spotted having a knock-about at the US Open with an enormous growth protruding from his elbow.

In what appeared to be a severe case of tennis elbow, the former world No 1 had a lump almost the size of a tennis ball sticking out of the back of his arm.

The 46-year-old, who won the Slam himself in 1989, is at the tournament as current world No 1 Novak Djokovic's coach.

Ouch: The lump looks sore but Becker, who is Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic's coach, carries on

But it seems the former German star, who won Wimbledon three times in the 1980s, as well as three French Opens and one Australian Open, needs to put his racket down and give his arm a rest.

Becker was only named as the Serbian's coach last year but the huge lump on his elbow may be a sign he needs a rest.

Surprisingly the lump is on his left arm, suggesting the injury may not be tennis-related as he is a right-handed player.

Tennis elbow is a condition that causes pain and inflammation around the outside of the elbow.

It is caused by the overuse of the muscles of the forearm, often through activities that place repeated stress on the elbow joint, such as playing tennis or decorating.Paracetemol and anti-inflammatory drugs can ease the pain, while severe cases can require physiotherapy or even surgery.

However, in Boris Becker's case, the mystery lump on his left arm may not be the result of tennis elbow; particularly because he is right-handed.Instead, it could have resulted from a sudden injury - such as a blow to the elbow, causing bleeding or fluid build-up - or infection.

Tennis elbow lasts between six months and two years. However, in about nine out of 10 cases, a full recovery is made within a year.

However Becker will have to go careful on the double-handed backhands for the time being, especially when facing this year's Wimbledon champion, Djokovic.

Fans spotted the lump on Becker's left elbow was he watched the Serbian breeze past Argentine player Diego Schwartzman 6-1, 6-2, 6-4 today. 

But more pictures of the uncomfortable-looking bump appeared later on as photographers watched Becker having a knock-up at the Arthur Ashe stadium court at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in New York.

Djokovic, who said he enjoyed playing in the late evening slot at the Open, next plays Paul-Henri Mathieu.

Djokovic and Murray are on course to face each other in the quarter finals should they both reach that stage.

Murray laboured to beat Dutchman Robin Haase yesterday over four sets.

It is not all work for Becker, however. 

He was seen relaxing in the Flushing district of Queens, New York yesterday with his wife Lilly.

The couple were seen laughing and kissing as Mrs Becker sipped on a glass of wine.
