The myth of the 'mean girl' has finally been debunked, with new research proving that it is boys who are more likely to spread malicious rumors, be manipulative and reject or exclude others at school.

According to researchers from the University of Georgia, who asked 620 randomly-selected students to complete an annual survey every year between the ages of 11 and 18, it is young boys who are more likely to engage in these behaviors – categorized as ‘relational aggression’ – and who are more likely to be the victims of such abuse.

Of the children surveyed, a large majority, both boys and girls, claimed that it was male students, in every grade, from six through 12, who often engaged in socially aggressive behavior, rather than the females.

However, the analysis also showed that the number of boys who felt victimized by their fellow classmates significantly decreased over the seven-year period, whereas the number of girls who were victims of moderate to high degrees of bullying remained more of less the same during that time.

Professor Pamela Orpinas, who led the study, said: 'Overall, we found relational aggression to be a very common behavior.'

She added that 96per cent of the students surveyed had passed a rumor or made a nasty comment about someone over the course of the study.

Experiences of some form of victimization were found to be universal as well, with over 90per cent of the students reporting that they had been victims of social aggression at least once, according to the report, which was published in the journal Aggressive Behavior.

 Dr Orpinas added: 'We have books, websites and conferences aimed at stopping girls from being aggressive, as well as a lot of qualitative research on why girls are relationally aggressive.

'But oddly enough, we don’t have enough research on why boys would be relationally aggressive because people have assumed it’s a girl behavior.'

She explained that much more research is necessary to understand why girls are more likely than boys to be targets of aggression or to perceive certain acts as aggressive.

'While the study may call for more scholarship on "mean boys" and why they behave the way they do, the findings ultimately emphasize a need to include boys and girls equally in programs aimed at reducing relational aggression,' she said.

'In the end, I think we need to ask how we can focus on increasing the positive interactions among kids rather than the negative ones, because the kids that students admire are often the ones who are fun and positive about others.'
