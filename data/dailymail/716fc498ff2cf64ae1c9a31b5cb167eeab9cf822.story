Fishermen have found the body of an English cyclist floating in the sea off one of the French Riviera’s most popular beauty spots, it emerged yesterday.

The unnamed man, who was in his 50s and came from Liverpool, was dressed in sports kit including a helmet when he was spotted at Eze, near Nice.

The medieval village is situated on a high hill which cascades into the Mediterranean, which is where the man washed up on Saturday.

‘His bike was found nearby, but the reason for his death remains a mystery,’ said a source from the local prosecutors’ office.

They have opened a preliminary investigation, with judicial police interviewing the fishermen and searching for forensics.

The source said an autopsy will be held later this week so as to determine the exact cause of death. No theory for the death – which range from a cycling accident to murder and suicide – has yet been ruled out, the source added.

Eze is well known for its sea views, and beautiful gardens, and has become a home to numerous celebrities. Those with a home there include members of the rock band, U2. 

The area is always packed with cyclists, including many from the UK who are attracted by the long seaside routes, and the mild climate.
