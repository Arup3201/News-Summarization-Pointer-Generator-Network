Three members of the Durham family were 
pronounced dead at the scene on the A18 near Laceby Manor Golf Club, 
Grimsby, while two died in the nearby Diana Princess of Wales Hospital. 
The driver of the lorry is thought to have sustained minor injuries.

Floral tributes were today laid outside the family home in Chester-Le-Street, County Durham.

The crash happened at 12.30pm yesterday near Oaklands Hotel on the A18 Grimsby Road, in Laceby, when the family's Nissan Primera was in collision with a light goods vehicle.

Operations Superintendent Tracy Bradley, of Humberside Police, said: 'Our deepest thoughts go out to the family and friends of those who were tragically killed in this collision which happened on the A18 yesterday. We are working closely with relatives of those who lost their lives and are supporting them through what will be a very difficult time.

'Roads policing officers are working 
closely with our collision investigation team to piece together the 
evidence we have gathered in order to try and determine what led to this
tragic incident taking place and took the lives of those travelling in 
the Nissan at the time.

'We have spoken to a number of key 
witnesses already, however, if anyone saw the incident but has not come 
forward I would ask them to do so.'

Crash: Three people were pronounced dead at the scene, the two remaining passengers died at hospital

Scene: The head-on collision between the family's car and the light goods vehicle occurred at 12.30pm today on Barton Street, Grimsby

A force spokesman said relatives of the family have asked to be left alone.

Hundreds of people left their condolences on a special Facebook page set up in tribute to the family.

More than 22,500 people had joined the R.I.P Cockburn Family page on the social networking site in just a few hours.

The page features photographs of the family, including some of Carley and Bethany wearing dancing costumes.

One person left a message which read: 'So so sad xx dancing with the angels now x R.I.P xxx'

Another posted: 'Dance in heaven beautiful angels x'

On a photo of Lacie, who would have turned two next month, one Facebook user wrote: 'Sleep tight lacie a beautiful girl and now a precious angel'.

Many people left anecdotes about the 
family on the page, with one describing Mr Cockburn as 'a gentle kind 
man' who was 'totally devoted to his family'.

A
number of people had also posted tributes on Bethany's personal 
Facebook page, on which she wrote that she was in a relationship with 
Garry Stephenson, a soldier in the Scots Guards, and described daughter 
Lacie as 'Our world!'.

Carley and Bethany are believed to have been members of a dance school in Washington, Tyne and Wear.

A dance teacher from the Durham area, who did not want to be named, said the dancing community had been left 'distraught' by the news of Carley and Bethany's deaths.

She said: 'It's just the shock of it happening on the way to this festival. Everyone's just totally distraught at the moment.'

Chris
Baron, resort director at Butlin's Skegness, said: 'We are all shocked 
and stunned by this tragedy and our thoughts go out to the extended 
families of the victims.

'Our
team at Skegness is offering support and assistance to the other 
competitors and their families. We are working closely with the dance 
competition organisers.'

'Our deepest thoughts go out to the family 
and friends of those who were tragically killed in this collision which 
happened on the A18 yesterday'

Witnesses said the road was notoriously dangerous. Jason Abrams, a golfer at the nearby Laceby Manor Golf Club, told ITV News: 'It's
a bendy road but people do go at a great lick along it. It's 60mph at 
the moment but the council are looking at changing it to 50 and 
hopefully this will make a difference.

‘A
car went into an articulated lorry. All we know is what the police have
said - that the car tried to overtake something or the car hit a curb 
which has sent it spinning out of control and obviously gone head-on 
into a lorry.’

Supt Bradley told the Grimsby Telegraph officers were looking for further witnesses to come forward.

‘At this moment in time we are 
conducting an investigation to try to find out what the cause of the 
incident was, and we have family liaison officers that are working with 
family and relatives of the deceased,' he said.

‘We would like to appeal to any 
witnesses that either saw any of the vehicles prior to the collision or 
saw the incident occurring.’

Eight emergency vehicles were called 
to the scene, five ambulances and three fire engines, according to witnesses.

The road was closed for investigations but was reopened shortly after 10pm yesterday.

The road is one of the most notorious in the area and has been the scene of 20 accidents in the last three years.

It
featured in a BBC television programme, Britain's Most Dangerous Roads,
in 2011, which claimed it was 25 times more dangerous than the average 
British motorway.

It was 
also found to be the UK's highest-risk stretch of road for car drivers 
in a nationwide survey by the Road Safety Foundation in 2010.
