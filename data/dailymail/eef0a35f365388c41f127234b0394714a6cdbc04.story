Hannah Notley, 30, admitted lying to her 
bosses about the case being shelved when in fact she had not even 
submitted papers to the CPS

A policewoman who admitted failing to 
properly investigate a rape allegation before telling the victim the 
case had been dropped was warned she faces jail today.

Hannah Notley, 30, admitted lying to her bosses about the case being shelved when in fact she had not even submitted papers to the CPS.

Police Constable Notley, who worked for Essex Police and was based at Rayleigh Police Station, and was specially trained to investigate sex crimes committed a 'gross breach of trust' when the victim reported the rape allegation in 2011.

Notley fought back tears as she entered the dock at Inner London Crown Court before pleading guilty to one count of misconduct in public office.

She admitted that between July 11th, 2011, and April 21st, 2012, she 'wilfully engaged in conduct amounting an abuse of public trust in a public office without reasonable excuse.'

She failed to correct the assumption of her superiors at Essex Police that the case had been investigated and passed on to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), the court heard.

She then told the complainant, whose alleged attacker is currently awaiting trial, that it had been decided that no further action would be taken.

Sentencing was adjourned for reports until December 6th and her barrister Allan Compton told the court: 'Can I indicate there are quite complex personal backgrounds to the events in 2012.

'This does not involve corrupt behaviour.'

The Recorder of Westminster, Judge Alistair McCreath, added: 'I imagine she had so much to do that she did not get around to doing it.

'I dealt with a case like this last year.'

Addressing Notley, he added: 'As far as your case is concerned I will not sentence you today.

'I will sentence you in four weeks time on December 6th. You know why that is.

'It’s only fair to you the court knows about you when it comes for you to be sentenced.I will allow you to keep your bail.

'It’s very important you understand the court will pass on you on December 6th the sentence that is fair and correct in light of all the information the court then has.

'Nothing I am doing or saying today can mount in any way at all to a hint, indication, or indeed promise of what will await you.

'You understand the serious nature of what you have pleaded guilty to and the likely outcome.'
