Wasps are expected to confirm on Tuesday that they have bought a majority share in the company that owns the Ricoh Arena, allowing them to move to Coventry on a permanent basis.

According to the Daily Telegraph, the playing staff at the Aviva Premiership club have already been informed of a proposed move from Adams Park in time for the start of next season.

It is hoped the move - expected to cost in the region of £30million - will secure the long-term future of Wasps, who were rescued from potential bankrputcy last year after a period of financial instability.

The Ricoh Arena, opened in 2006, is owned by Arena Coventry Limited, whose operating company is jointly owned by Coventry City Council and the the Alan Edward Higgs charity.

The council will vote on whether to approve Wasps' proposed takeover at a meeting Tuesday.

Coventry City Football Club recently started playing their matches at the Ricoh Arena again after they were forced to temporarily move to Northampton Town's Sixfields over a pay dispute.

Wasps are currently based at the home of Wycombe Wanderers Football Club, where they have been since 2002 after moving from Sudbury, Middlesex.

The club have won the Heineken Cup twice as well as lifting four Premiership titles, but they have struggled to compete with England and Europe's elite in recent years due to their financial troubles.
