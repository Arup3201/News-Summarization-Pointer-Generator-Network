Brigitte Tee-Hillman, who supplies Michele Roux Jr's London restaurant, says this year has been 'phenomenal' for wild mushrooms

Foragers are heralding a bumper year for wild mushrooms after the hot summer and mild autumn brought about a glut of the woodland delicacies.

The perfect conditions has produced the best crop of wild mushrooms in eight years, according to one of the UK’s leading mushroom experts.

Veteran forager Brigitte Tee, the only person in the country licensed to pick mushrooms commercially in the New Forest, said conditions this year were 'phenomenal'.

The 71-year-old said above average temperatures were to thank for the abundance of the much sought-after fungi in forests and fields around Britain.

It is a stark contrast to last year when heavy rain and cold temperatures in autumn and winter all but wiped out the country’s wild mushrooms.

This year’s mushroom haul has been so prevalent it has sparked a rise in the number of guerilla pickers pillaging certain rural areas.

Mrs Tee, who supplies wild mushrooms to London’s top restaurants including Michel Roux Jr’s Le Gavroche, said: 'It has been an absolutely bumper year for mushrooms and it’s not over yet.

'Last year was the worst year for mushrooms in a long time.

'Some mushrooms grew but most were completely waterlogged, submerged in an inch and a half of rain water. Thankfully it is all change this year.

'The difference is that we have had a good, long summer and the soil is still warm.

'Phenomenal years like this one only come round once every eight years - that seems to be the growing cycle of mushrooms.

'Next year is likely to be just an average year so we are making the most of it now.

'Already there have been loads of beefsteak mushrooms and the ceps are so prevalent it is likely they will go on until December.

'But this year will go down as the year of the hen of the wood, quite an unusual mushroom that you won’t find in supermarkets.

'This year it has been plentiful. One special year like this one I picked 75 kilograms of mushrooms in three hours on Christmas Eve.'

German-born Mrs Tee started picking mushrooms in the New Forest in 1973 after turning her back on a career as an air steward with Pan Am.

Ms Tee says the usual crop of mushrooms were almost all wiped out last year and predicts and average year for 2014

In 2002 she was arrested while picking mushrooms in the New Forest and charged with theft.

Thirty two court appearances later, over four years, the case was thrown out at a cost of £1million of taxpayers’ money.

She also won a civil suit against the Forestry Commission and was granted a unique licence from the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs.

Mrs Tee is now the only person in the country who can legally pick more than the allotted 3lbs of mushrooms in the New Forest.

She added: 'Unlike some, I make sure the mushrooms don’t die off by cutting their stalks instead of pulling their roots off.

'By doing that you can return to a patch of mushrooms 10 days later and they will have grown back.

'Some people come and pick truckloads of mushrooms and then sell them on illegally while others leave their rubbish all over the forest.

'I don’t do that - I look after nature. Foraging for mushrooms is a lovely way of life. I think of it as going out to look for old friends.

'Mushrooms were among the earliest forms of life on earth and I always say that when I die I will come back as a mushroom because I am indestructible.'
