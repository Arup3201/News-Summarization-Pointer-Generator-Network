The Uncharted games are some of the most cinematic ever made, raising the bar on PS3 in terms of story-telling and graphics.

And even though the PS3 is coming to the end of its life, developers Naughty Dog - behind the Crash Bandicoot games - are determined to push the console's limits one final time.

In hiding: Naughty Dog and Sony have kept quiet about The Last of Us for some time, however, early screens suggest it will be one of the PS3's best-looking titles

Enter The Last of Us, which follows the story of two survivors after a deadly fungus outbreak.

Black-marketeer Joel made a promise to an old friend to look after a young girl called Ellie, and together they have to make their way across a fiercely militarised America, journeying through quarantined towns maintained through martial law.

To make matters worse, they also have to fight off the Infected, whose sole aim is to continue spreading the disease.

Apart from brilliant graphics (powered by Naughty Dog's in-house engine), the game's most staggering feature is its AI. Using a system called 'Balance of Power' enemies will react realistically to your behaviour.

They may aggressively group together and attack you if they have the edge in battle. However, if you have the advantage, they'll take cover more or try and sneak up behind you.

Life-like: Characters will react realistically according to how you approach battles. Multiplayer, too, has been confirmed with Naughty Dog last year defending concerns that it would feel 'tacked on' to the single player

The enemy will also react if one of their friends is killed, showing fear and anger while warning other teammates of the situation.

Ellie, too, will dynamically influence battles by throwing objects or causing distractions.

It's set for release on May 7.
