Fast-food giant McDonald’s has apologised for a recent advertisement which pokes fun at the haze of pollution which has covered Singapore.

The ad used the acronym PSI, which usually stands for Pollutants Standards Index, to promote a new range of dipping sauces, giving it new meaning in the line ‘today’s Peak Sauce Index is looking deliciously high’.

As Singaporeans choked on some of the worst air pollution in the country’s history, the ad was published in local newspapers, much to the dismay of many residents.

A McDonald’s spokesman said the advertisement was ‘not intended to trivialise the current haze situation’ and that it was a one-off promotion which was designed and assigned when the haze was not as bad.

Considering that the situation had become a lot worse at the time of publication in mid-June, the spokesman admitted that the ad was ‘inappropriate’.

She said: ‘We are truly sorry that it has led people to feel that way.

‘We share the concerns of Singaporeans and were equally surprised to see PSI levels hit record highs.’

One disgruntled consumer wrote on the McDonald’s Singapore Facebook page: ‘Not funny McDonald’s.’

But another said that Singaporeans 
needed ‘to have a sense of humour as well as being positive in spite of 
the hazy times we are now in’.

The PSI level in Singapore dropped to its lowest yesterday since the country was covered by the dirty haze two weeks ago. Air quality is said to have improved thanks to prevailing winds.

Singapore's main index for air pollution hit 401 on June 23, exceeding previous record highs of 371 and 321 the week before. Those measurements were classified as 'hazardous' and can aggravate respiratory ailments. Any reading above 200 is considered threatening to health.

Illegal slash-and-burn fires in Sumatra have been blamed for the smoky pollution which forced the closure of hundreds of schools in Malaysia and Indonesia.

Hospitals and clinics in areas badly affected by haze have recorded a rise of more than 100 per cent in asthma cases, along with a rise in respiratory problems and conjunctivitis.

Singapore's Environment Minister Vivian Balakrishnan had urged Indonesia to take 'urgent and definitive action' to combat the pollution at its source.

'This is now the worst haze that Singapore has ever faced,' Mr Balakrishnan wrote on his Facebook page.

'No country or corporation has the right to pollute the air at the expense of Singaporeans' health and well-being.'
