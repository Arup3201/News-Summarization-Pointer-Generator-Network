Saido Berahino has insisted strike partner Brown Ideye is a ‘great player’ and backed the Nigeria international to start scoring the goals his £10million price tag demands.

Ideye has found the net only once for West Bromwich Albion in five games and injured his ankle doing so against Hull in the Capital One Cup.

He missed almost a month recovering from the problem but has trained all week and is set to play a role against Manchester United on Monday night.

Berahino, starring for England’s Under-21s, has been West Brom’s most potent attacking threat this season scoring six goals in nine games. He believes Ideye can begin chipping in too.

‘Just because he hasn’t been scoring doesn’t mean he hasn’t been a great player,’ said Berahino. ‘I see him day in day out on the training pitches and he is a good finisher. His fitness wasn’t there because he joined us a bit late but he is understanding the team.

‘It’s hard as well because it’s a new environment for him in the Premier League. I just think you’ve got to give him time to adjust.

‘He is confident, he has come in and hasn’t been shy. He speaks to everyone. Unfortunately he got an injury. He got his goal and I know he was gutted. Hopefully we can get him back fit because we’ll need him.’
