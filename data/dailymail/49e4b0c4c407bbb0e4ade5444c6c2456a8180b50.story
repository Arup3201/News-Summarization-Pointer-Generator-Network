Two Missouri farmers who became seriously ill after being bitten by ticks were found to have contracted a new type of disease dubbed the ‘Heartland virus,’ according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Both patients were admitted to hospitals after experiencing high fevers, fatigue, diarrhea and loss of appetite. Although their blood count was low, the patients did not suffer abnormal bleeding.

They were initially thought to be suffering from a bacterial infection, but that diagnosis was found to be incorrect when their condition didn't improve after being treated with antibiotics.

All in the family: The newly identified 'heartland virus' belongs to the phlebovirus family, which has about 70 members - many of them insect-borne

Further tests revealed the men’s blood contained a new kind virus. The bug belongs to the  phlebovirus family which contains about 70 members, many of them carried by flies, mosquitoes or ticks, and can cause disease in humans, Discovery News reported.

Hantavirus, spread by deer mice, comes from the same group, and so does the deadly Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever.

Laura McMullan, a senior scientist at the CDC who co-authored the study, said that while the genetic material of 'Heartland virus' appears similar to that of other phleboviruses, the particular proteins it produces are different enough to call it a new species.

The new virus' closest relative is another tick-borne phlebovirus, called severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) virus, which was identified last year in China, and causes death in 12 per cent of cases.

Possible culprit: Researchers believe Amblyomma americanum, or Lone Star tick, may be one of the hosts of the 'Heartland virus'

Another possible relative may be Bhanja virus, a rare condition that has been found in some mammals, birds and reptiles in Asia, Africa and Europe.

According to the study published in the August 30 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, a species commonly found in Missouri called Amblyomma americanum, or Lone Star tick, may be one of the hosts of 'Heartland virus.'

McMullan said more studies are needed to identify the insects carrying the disease, learn how many people contract it and find risk factors for infection.

Because the 'Heartland virus' causes such general symptoms, it could be ‘a more common cause of human illness than is currently recognized,’ the researchers wrote.

In 2009, Robert Wonderly, then-57 year old, of Sheridan, Missouri, and a 67-year-old man also living in northwestern Missouri had reported tick bites, NBC reported.

Wonderly said his wife plucked a single insect off his abdomen with tweezers, while the other patient said he must have been bitten about 20 times a day for two weeks while rebuilding fences on his property.

Epicenter: One of the two patients who contracted the rare illness was bitten by a single tick in his hometown of Sheridan, Missouri

‘I was getting worse and worse,’ Wonderly, now 60, recalled. 

The men had all the symptoms of ehrlichiosis, a relatively common but potentially dangerous tick-borne infection.

But when scientists looked at the farmers’ blood samples under the microscope, the bacteria was nowhere to be found, leading them to believe that they were onto something new.

‘This particular virus has never been detected before,’ said Dr William L. Nicholson, a research microbiologist who specializes in emerging and zoonotic infectious with the CDC. ‘This is unique to the world.’

The TV station Fox23 reported that the first patient, Wonderly, spent 10 days in the hospital. Two years later, he is still feeling tired and often suffers from headaches. Initially, he had memory problems and loss of appetite, both of which slowly improved.

The second patient, who has not been named, was in the hospital for 12 days. Over the next weeks, he too suffered from memory problems, fatigue, and loss of appetite, but the symptoms eventually went away.

Dangerous cousin: The new virus' closest relative is another tick-borne phlebovirus, called SFTS virus, which was identified last year in China

The illness was given the moniker the ‘Heartland virus’ in honor of Heartland Regional Medical Center in St. Joseph, Missouri, where the patients were treated, and also because it was discovered in a region commonly known as the nation’s heartland.

So far, scientists believe that the two farmers are the only people in the world to have contracted the bug, but they are sure there are more cases out there.

While researchers are working to learn more about the new virus, the CDC recommends using repellents that contain 20 per cent or more DEET to prevent tick bites, as well as avoiding wooded areas or areas with high grass.

The agency lists 10 tick-borne diseases in the U.S., including Lyme disease, which infected about 30,000 Americans in 2010, as well as anaplasmosis and ehrlichiosis, which affect about 1,000 people each a year.
