In today's selfie-obsessed world, one motorist has perhaps taken the desire to chronicle every moment of life to a new low.

Andrew Mac appeared to smile through the pain as he set his phone up to record as he was cut free from the twisted metal of his car.

The young Canadian found himself trapped in the mangled wreckage of his vehicle with broken bones after he blacked-out, slewed off the road and slammed into a lamppost.

While the bloodied and battered driver waited for emergency workers to free him from the crash he directed the camera on his face.

Mr Mac managed to pull faces and even make jokes while fire fighter using cutting equipment, known as the jaws of life, worked to free him.

During the two-and-a-half minute clip that he posted online the disorientated driver said: 'Why couldn't I hit on the passenger side?' 

One paramedics could be heard offering words of encouragement, 'Buddy you are doing really really good,' as Mr Mac commented on the bright lights

The same paramedic can also be heard telling the injured motorist: 'The hot nurses are going to be all over you.'

Moments later Mr Mac, who was wearing a neck brace, calmly tells the emergency worker that he cannot feel his legs and says he just wants to go to sleep.

As rescuers get closer to Mr Mac they can be seen  over his shoulder as they cut away the crumpled metal.
