Trabzonspor want Liverpool defender Kolo Toure.

The 33-year-old has one year left on contract but Liverpool will consider offers as they look to bid again for Dejan Lovren at Southampton.

Liverpool confirmed their fourth summer signing on Tuesday when Serbian international Lazar Markovic completed a £20million move from Benfica.

Markovic's arrival took Liverpool’s spending towards the £60m mark following the arrivals of Rickie Lambert and Adam Lallana from Southampton and Emre Can from Bayer Leverkusen.

But the club are not done yet, with Brendan Rodgers still chasing Belgium striker Divock Origi and exploring the possibility of reviving a deal for Sevilla left-back Alberto Moreno.
