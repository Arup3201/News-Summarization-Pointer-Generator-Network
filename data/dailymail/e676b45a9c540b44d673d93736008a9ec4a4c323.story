The Canadian man who killed and
dismembered a Chinese student in 2012 was raised by a domineering mother who would get drunk on vodka and was obsessed with germs, the man's father testified on Friday, while
describing himself as an alcoholic schizophrenic.

Luka Magnotta, 32, has admitted killing and dismembering
engineering student Jun Lin, 33, and to videotaping the acts and
mailing parts of the body to several addresses. 

He is pleading
not guilty due to mental illness.

The 50-year-old father is a tall, heavyset man from Ontario who cannot be named because of a court-ordered publication ban. 

Triggers: Luka Magnotta, 32, the Canadian man who killed and dismembered a Chinese student in 2012 had a troubled childhood, his father testified on Friday

He told the jury in a Montreal courtroom that Magnotta and
Magnotta's younger brother and sister were taught at home by his
ex-wife, Anna Yourkin. 

He said the children had no friends and
never played with children their own age.

'She was very clingy,' he said of his ex-wife. 'She wanted
to have total control over them.'

Murdered: Jun Lin was a Chinese exchange student in Montreal, who once dated Magnotta. A video shows him being horribly mutilated and partially eaten

Trail: Pieces of Jun Lin were discovered more than 2,800 miles apart after Magnotta dropped his lover's dismembered limbs in the post

Yourkin was a heavy drinker who had such a phobia of germs
that she would not let the children use public washrooms,
instead making them wait until they got home, the father said.

'They were very mixed-up kids and they still are,' he told
the court. 

The prosecutor in the case says Magnotta had planned to kill a person for at least six months before the crime was committed,and that he had emailed a British journalist in 2011 saying he planned to kill and videotape the act. 

The court has seen a video of the killing and dismemberment which added a suggestion of cannibalism to what is considered one of Canada's grisliest murder trials. 

Gory: Police  discovered  blood stains inside Magnotta's Montreal apartment fridge

Evidence: Other bloodied items were discovered at his home including this T-shirt

Graphic: This heavily blood-stained mattress was discovered at the crime scene

After the killing, Magnotta sent body parts from Montreal to
two elementary schools in Vancouver and to two political parties
in Ottawa, wrapping the hands and feet in pink tissue paper and
including poems and notes.

Magnotta was the subject of an international
manhunt. He was arrested in a Berlin Internet cafe, where he
was reading about himself.

Magnotta's father said he and Yourkin got married at age 17 and 16, respectively, when Yourkin got pregnant with Magnotta. 

They named the baby Eric Clinton Kirk Newman after actors Clint Eastwood and Kirk Douglas. 

Weapon: Another photo of a knife was entered into evidence during the high profile Canadian murder trial

Wrapped: Jurors were shown pieces of pink tissue paper which Magnotta used to wrap up Lin's body parts 

Chaos: Police found a number of knives and protective Nitrile gloves while searching the crime scene 

Magnotta, who later changed his name, grew up moving from
town to town in Ontario and spent much of his childhood with an
abusive maternal grandmother, the father said.

He said Magnotta started school in Grade 6 - when children
are typically aged 11 or 12 - after the family was forced to
move because they could no longer pay their mortgage.

The father, who said he lost two jobs because of his own
drinking problems, added he was opposed to Magnotta being
educated at home, but worked long hours and deferred to his
wife.

He said he later managed to quit drinking and realized he
had a psychiatric problem. 'I heard voices, I felt like
(committing) suicide,' he said. 'I felt angry.'
