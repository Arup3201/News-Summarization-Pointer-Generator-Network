Rebecca Berry, was found dead in the garden of her home in Edmondsham in Dorset with burns. Police are investigating how the teenager was injured

A schoolgirl of 15 has died from severe burns amid fears she may have set herself on fire.

Police are investigating after Rebecca Berry was found collapsed in her garden by a relative.

The teenager, pictured – known to friends as Rebe – was pronounced dead a short time later.

Police said they were not treating her death as suspicious, but do not yet know whether she intended to set fire to herself or was the victim of a tragic accident at the house in Edmondsham, near Verwood, Dorset.

One neighbour said: ‘She was lovely, very friendly. The whole village is very upset.’

Fellow pupils at Queen Elizabeth School, Wimborne, have been offered counselling.

A police spokesman said: ‘The body of the girl was discovered at 9.18pm on Monday by a family member.’

The results of a post mortem examination yesterday have yet to be released. 

Firefighters were called to a property fire in the village at about 9.15pm on Monday, along with paramedics, but could do nothing to save the girl, who was pronounced dead at the scene.

The teenager lived with her mother Gill and step-father Scott, a chimney sweep, at a farm in the sleepy and picturesque Dorset hamlet.

A statement issued by her family said: 'We as a family are pulling together to help each other cope with the devastating loss of our beautiful girl and are gathering strength from each other to guide us through this time.

'We would like to thank friends and the village community for their continuing support and kind words.

'The family would like to encourage people to lay floral tributes at Edmondsham Pump to pay their respects to Rebe.' 

Tributes have appeared at the pump and close to her home in the hamlet since Miss Berry's death on Monday.

The teenager was a year 10 pupil at Queen Elizabeth's School in nearby Wimborne. 

Dorset Police confirmed it was not treating the death as suspicious but had so far been unable to determine how the girl came to suffer the burns

Martin McLeman, headteacher at the school, posted on its website: 'It is with deep regret that I write to advise you of the death of one of our Year 10 girls. 

'We are devastated by this news and our thoughts are with her family and friends at this extremely sad time. 

'I have advised all Year 10 students at school this morning and they may need the support of their families when they return home this evening and over the coming weeks. 

'Counselling and support has been arranged here and is available at school for everyone in the school community affected by this tragic event.

'If you feel your son or daughter needs any support in dealing with this difficult issue at any time, then please let me know.' 

Mr McLeman added that staff and pupils were being supported by the chaplaincy team and county council and that they were praying for the student's family.

A neighbour in Edmondsham, who asked to remain anonymous, said: 'She was a lovely young girl, very friendly, you could always have a chat with her. The whole village is very upset.'
