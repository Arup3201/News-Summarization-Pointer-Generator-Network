Checking that no one is looking, I step gingerly on to the grassy bank. I find my usual spot and put the paper bag with the bottle on the picnic table near by.

My heart is pounding in gleeful expectation. On the hottest day of the year, this is the moment I’ve been waiting for. Any minute now I will feel the intoxicating rush of endorphins that every addict craves.

I lie back, wait and — whoosh, there it is — the blast of heat as the sun’s rays burn into my skin.

Sunbathing addict: Kate Mulvey, pictured soaking up the sun on holiday last year, loves the feeling of the sun's rays on her skin

For this is not a secret swig of vodka or an illicit line of cocaine, it is a sneaky hit of ultraviolet. I am a sunbathing addict, in the proper sense of the word.

Although I know all about the dangers of sunbathing, I can’t stop exposing my body to the sun’s harmful rays.

As an educated and normally rational woman, of course I am aware of the danger: deaths from the worst form of skin cancer have more than trebled over the past 40 years — melanoma kills 1,550 people in England and Wales each year, compared with only 400 a year in the Sixties.

I know I am risking my life every time I peel off my clothes to roast myself on a foreign beach for hours on end.

Can't stop, won't stop: Kate is still tanned despite the possibility of cancer

The evidence of the sun’s destructive effects are all too clear when I look in the mirror and see deep furrows across my forehead and crepey wrinkles in my decolletage. Yet still I can’t — won’t — stop.

The truth is, I love sunbathing far too much to worry about the cancer risk.

For me there is nothing more fulfilling than lying in my bikini on a sun lounger, drinking in that glorious warmth as the sun’s golden rays soak into my skin. The intoxicating smell of coconut oil and the sense of well-being are simply wonderful.

Then there is the thrill of seeing bright white tan lines against your bronzed body. I feel instantly sexier and more glamorous as I slip into a summer dress and my confidence soars.

Yes, worthier friends might nag me to stop, but I simply refuse to sit in the shade wearing Factor 50 and a dreadful hat.

Now, at least, I have an excuse. Sunbathing is addictive.

According to scientists at Harvard University in the U.S., lying in the sun produces an emotional effect similar to that of heroin.

The sun’s rays stimulate production of endorphins, the ‘feel-good’ hormones that ease pain, and act on the body like opioid drugs. And, like those drugs, they are highly addictive.

My obsession with ultraviolet light began in the late Seventies. I was 16 and everybody was at it. The fashion was for a deep mahogany tan, and my friends and I wanted to ape the glamorous celebrities who wafted around places like Portofino and St Tropez looking as if they had been dipped in molasses.

Cheap foreign holidays had just begun to be popular and my family were able to swap our usual rainy week in Cornwall for the beaches of Southern Italy.

Intoxicating: Kate loves nothing more than than lying in her bikini on a sun lounger

Suddenly we were plunged into a world where the temperature often reached 37c. I was hooked. My sisters and I would spend all day glued to our sunbeds.

We would take a packed lunch to the beach and slather ourselves in delicious-smelling tanning unguents. It was so hot we would often lie in the sea, letting the waves cool us down. They say water reflects the sun’s rays onto the body, making you even browner, so that was perfect.

One day a friend suggested that we could ‘speed up the process’ by applying olive oil. For the next few days we lay on the beach basting our nut-brown bodies and reeking of salad dressing.

Bronzed and beautiful: Despite criticisms, Kate has always loved the feeling of being tanned

But in the evenings, when we walked down the streets flaunting our bronzed bodies and checking the admiring glances from local boys, it was worth it.

There were times when my obsession with the sun backfired. Sometimes I returned from the beach lobster-red and in agony with sunburn.

I’ve had sunstroke, too, once as a 17-year-old and twice in my supposedly wiser 20s. I would wake up with flu-like symptoms and be confined to my villa, drinking bottle after bottle of water and taking painkillers. Yet still I would be anxious to return to the beach.

And it didn’t stop there. In the late Nineties, when the skin cancer scares began and everybody embraced the milk-bottle look, I carried on sunbathing with gusto.

It was around this time that the term ‘tanorexia’ was first coined, to describe the shocking number of young people desperate to ape permanently bronzed celebrities such as Victoria Beckham and Katie Price.

The fact that I was working on a beauty magazine and received daily press releases on the dangers of the sun did nothing to blunt  my enthusiasm.

In summer, when everyone went to the local bistro for lunch, I would nip off to the town square, my bikini under my dress, to find a sunny spot and top up my tan.

Then I started to crave sunbathing in the winter months.

One freezing January in the late Nineties, I persuaded my then boyfriend to take me to Barbados. The minute I stepped out of the plane into sunshine, I felt so glad to be alive.

To hell with the consequences: Kate sunbathes whenever possible

When he went off water-skiing, I planted myself on my sun lounger and didn’t move till sundown.Back home, if there was a party or I was feeling a bit down, I would book a few sunbed sessions so I felt attractive again. Even though I knew tanning beds aged the skin, I chose to ignore how dangerous they were.

Wiser friends tried to talk sense into me, but it was like telling a 40-a-day smoker to give up there and then. I couldn’t.

I have tried to go cold turkey a couple of times.

Last year, as I approached 50 and started to worry about my wrinkles, I decided it was finally time to go pale. I was sick of people telling me that tans were no longer glamorous or sexy.

‘Look, Kate’s trying to be an extra out of TOWIE,’ a spiteful acquaintance shouted one evening at a posh art do, as I wafted in bronzed and wearing a short dress. Everyone laughed and the message was clear. I looked naff.

I decided to avoid the sun altogether. That lasted just a week.

I tried a salon spray-tan, too, but that didn’t do the trick, either. It left brown marks on a friend’s sofa, blotched and disappeared in a couple of days. My skin was a bright shade of tangerine — and it didn’t feel anything like as good as soaking up the sun.

So now I sunbathe whenever possible. To hell with the consequences. And as soon as summer is over, I start counting the days until my winter holiday.

Then, when I come back, I book another holiday straight away, just to keep me going.

Having a tan makes me feel good about myself. I don’t smoke or drink. I eat brown rice and chia seeds. I sleep for eight hours a night and do a lot of exercise. So what if I sunbathe? I enjoy it.

So as soon as the mercury rises again, you can bet your bottom dollar I will be at the lido with all the other addicts, breathing in the smell of suntan cream.
