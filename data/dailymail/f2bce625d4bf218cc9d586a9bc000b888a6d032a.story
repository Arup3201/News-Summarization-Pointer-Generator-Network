When you're invited to have lunch with the Queen, you ensure not a hair is out of place, even if she is your grandmother.

Princess Beatrice is now almost as famous for her shiny locks as her cousin by marriage, the Duchess of Cambridge, but she was taking no chances when it came to attending the Queen's Christmas lunch.

The 26-year-old royal was spotted emerging from a South Kensington hair salon early this morning, hours before being driven to Buckingham Palace for the royal family's annual festive event.

En route to the Palace, Princess Beatrice cut a glamorous figure as she strolled down the London street after her hair appointment and was visibly pleased with the results.

She opted for a voluminous style with a mass of tumbling curls  falling onto her shoulders as she walked through Kensington.

Beatrice, who is currently completing an internship, was caught up in the recent Sony scandal after details of her salary were among those leaked by hackers, believed to be linked to North Korea.

The young royal has been earning $30,000 a year while working as an 'intermediate production coordinator', according to hacked information. 

She began the placement at the beginning of the year after quitting her job at an investment capital firm and following a period travelling around the globe with her boyfriend Dave Clarke. 

The lunch was also attended by Prince William, who was fresh from an early morning visit to homeless charity Centrepoint in London's Soho, with his glossy-haired wife Kate.

All smiles: Despite having endured a torrid few days as a result, the Princess seemed content

Cheerful: The Princess even waved to passersby as she was driven to the Christmas lunch

Despite having endured a torrid few days as a result, the Princess was all smiles as she left the salon and appeared to be on cheerful form as she was driven into Buckingham Palace, even waving at passersby.
