It was a city known for its beautiful beaches and boasts one of the longest cherry blossom tree tunnels in Japan.

But after a tsunami and a nuclear disaster both struck in the space of 12 months, Tomioka was turned into a ghost city.

These eerie images, captured by a drone, show what is left of the area near Fukushima that had to be abandoned overnight.

More than 15,000 residents living in 6,000 houses were forced to evacuate in March 2011 because of safety fears concerning dangerous radiation levels.

Three years on, schools and 
business are still prevented from returning while parks, playgrounds, roads and the city's train station have been left covered in overgrown grass.

A total of 300,000 people have been evacuated from the east coast of the country since the disasters and 15,884 have died.

Road to nowhere: The way into Tomioka, Fukushima, has been blocked off, preventing residents from going back because of dangerous radiation levels

Devastated: The coastal area was virtually wiped out by the 2011 tsunami. The beach used to be popular with tourists in the summer

Stuck: A fishing vessel that was washed ashore during the devastating tsunami still lies on the side of the road

Isolated: The boat has been left there for three years on the outskirts of the deserted city, which was evacuated because of radiation fears following the nuclear disaster

Playground: A children's swing set that has not been used since the city was abandoned lies in the middle of overgrown grass and below a cherry blossom tree

Worship: A group of statues line up along a footpath leading towards a shrine. It is surrounded by chains to prevent intruders from going inside

Last stop: The train station has become overgrown in the years after the town was evacuated. Residents were asked to leave in 2011 for fears of their safety following the nuclear disaster

Empty platforms: The images, including those of the empty station,  were caught on a drone which hovered over the abandoned community

Ruined: Signs that would welcome people into the station are left hanging from the derelict platform. The overheard lines used to power the trains have also collapsed

Eerie: A home destroyed by the tsunami, which was triggered by an earthquake, is left surrounded by debris

Nature: The desolate buildings surround the city's beautiful cherry blossom tunnel, one of the biggest in Japan

Broken: Windows have been shattered in houses around the city and floors have been cleared away

Aerial view: The drone captures how the edge of the city, the train station and the coastline have been devastated by the natural disasters

Stripped away: Storeys in homes are barely standing. Many of the grass areas and gardens in the city have been left to overgrow

Cleared out: Pieces of furniture and old toys are scattered over the floor in front of an abandoned building

Crumbled: A large hole in the side of a house created by the tsunami which struck in 2011. The city did have 15,000 residents living in 6,000 properties

Rusting: A set of monkey bars sits in a park next to a house. Almost 300,000 people have been evacuated across the Fukushima coastal region

Empty: An abandoned car lies in the middle of a field in Tomioka. An earthquake off the east coast caused the nuclear meltdown

Remains: Clothes still hang from a line outside an empty apartment. It shows how quicky the residents were forced to leave

Power: A solar panel is still harnessing sunlight and generating electricity, despite there being no residents to use the resources
