A group of college professors have launched an initiative to help parents build fun wheelchairs and therapy vehicles for their disabled children.

Frustrated by the expensive and limited wheelchair options for children, University of Delaware professors Cole Galloway, Michele Lobo and Sam Logan launched Go Baby Go, which offers instruction in how to create wheelchairs out of popular toy vehicles for about $200.

According to Go Baby Go, a standard toy car can be installed with seat backs, arm rests, or other structural amenities that make transportation more comfortable for children with physical disabilities.

Special idea: Professor Galloway's wheelchairs can be made in a matter of hours, by installing headrests, seat backs, and other structural additions onto the cars

The trio initially started the 
program in 2000, and have since created numerous instructional guides 
and videos showing how to remodel kids’ four-wheelers to accommodate 
disabled children’s various physical therapy needs.

That idea has already helped create hundreds of affordable wheelchairs around the country.

Professor Galloway revealed that the idea was inspired by a trip to the four-wheeler department at Toys R' Us.

He told The Today Show: ‘Anyone can build these in a matter of hours.’

Professor
 Galloway explained that the battery-powered cars’ on-and-off mechanisms
 can be rewired to help build a child’s strength.

For
 example, he advises placing the switch on a car’s foot bed if a child 
needs to build strength in their legs – as this placement will force 
them to stand up as the cruise along.

Wallet friendly: Professor Galloway created the Go Baby Go program to help parents create wheelchairs at a much lower cost than traditional models

Therapeutic: A trained physical therapist, Professor Galloway says that his toy car program can help children build strength too by strategically placing an on-and-off switch in areas that need therapeutic attention

For
 those who need to add strength in their necks, Professor Galloway 
recommends placing the switch in a headrest – forcing the child to push 
their head against the rest, and therefore exert and build strength in 
their neck.

He said that by
 using toy cars in fun designs shaped like animals or famous cartoons, 
disabled children feel like they are playing, rather than struggling to 
move through their day.

‘All kids deserve a ride on car that's set for them,’ Professor Galloway said.

‘That's
 going to take a little bit of modification for some kids. It might take
 a lot of modification for other kids. But everybody can get around 
independently.’

Typical fare: Toy cars typically look like this and cost around $200 at retail
