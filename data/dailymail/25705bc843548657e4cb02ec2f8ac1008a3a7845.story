A Wisconsin man has allegedly attacked two people with a Samurai sword in the boarding house-style building where they all lived, partially scalping and killing one of them.

Young Choi, 29, has been charged with first-degree intentional homicide in the attack that killed Dustin Vanderheyden, 27, and wounded David Gerard, 24.

The attack happened outside an apartment above Yanger's Bar on North 4th Street in Watertown on Thursday around 5pm.

Sword attack: Young Choi, 29, allegedly killed Dustin Vanderheyden, 27, and injured another man in a frenzied attack at the boarding house where they live

Vanderheyden was stabbed multiple times and Gerard was injured in the incident, which ended in a stand-off between Watertown police and Choi, who finally surrendered after police brought in a negotiator.

According to the Journal-Sentinel, Choi had told Vanderheyden's wife in the days preceding the attack that he was going to kill Vanderheyden so that he could have her for himself.

The woman told police that she persuaded Choi that the pair couldn't be together and that she didn't think he was any danger.

Court documents state that Choi had made 'bizarre statements all week long about being God,' and upon his arrest told police that officers could call him 'God.'

An hour before the attack, a third resident from the building heard hysterical yelling, reports Channel 3000, and found Vanderheyden in Choi's apartment.

He told police that Vanderheyden told him he had 'saved him,' and that Choi was 'crazy.'

During the attack, Gerard, a tenant on the first floor of the building, heard Vanderheyden screaming for help and went upstairs to investigate.

He thought Choi was hitting Vanderheyden with a stick, but realized it was a Samurai sword when he reached out to grab it, suffering lacerations to his hand and thumb.

There was hair and blood on the floors and walls, and Choi was repeatedly asking Vanderheyden, 'Who's God?'

Injured: Gerard received four stitches in his hand after trying to grab Choi's sword from him

Police found Choi on the top of a stairwell leading to the second floor. Officers negotiated with the man and he eventually surrendered.

Vanderheyden was found with several stab wounds on the second floor. He was rushed to Watertown Regional Medical Center and went in to surgery but died of his injuries.

Choi was calm when police took him into custody.

When he was questioned, he said, 'What do you want me to tell you? Want me to say I feel bad about it? Are you checking my humanistic nature? Checking all my psychological bounds? Or am I just a ruthless killer?' according to court documents.

Two other swords were found in Choi's apartment in the boarding house.

Gerard received stitches for his injuries in hospital and was released. He told WISN that he's upset no one else went to help Vanderheyden during the attack.

'I mean, there's a bunch of people living in a small space and the guy was screaming,' he said.

'In hindsight, I know I did everything I could in the situation but now that (Vanderheyden) died, I'm second-guessing things with myself.'
