A federal judge sentenced former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell to two years in prison on Tuesday, in a case that gripped the state and provided a cautionary tale for corrupt politicians across the United States.

Two years ago McDonnell was discussed as a possible presidential contender. Now he's headed behind bars for selling the influence of his office to the CEO of a dietary supplements company.

'I stand before you as a heartbroken and humbled man,' the former governor told U.S. District Judge James Spencer before he pronounced sentence.

'I can't fathom any deeper humiliation for me and my family.' 

McDonnell will have to report to prison by 2 p.m. on Feb. 9 – unless his lawyers can persuade the court to let him remain free while they appeal the jury verdicts.

Prosecutors had recommended a prison term of at least 10 years for McDonnell, who was convicted of 11 public corruption counts. Spencer quickly revised the report on federal sentencing guidelines for McDonnell down to a range of 6.5 to 8 years.

He then chose to lower the boom more gently still, opting for a 24-month sentence followed by two more years of supervised release. 

Defense attorneys asked Spencer to order three years of community service, arguing that the federal investigation that destroyed his career and exposed details of his rocky marriage and shaky finances was punishment enough.

If McDonnell had received a sentence of ten years or longer, he could have faced time in a penitentiary that viewers of the show 'Lockup' would recognize.

But his shorter term and the nonviolent nature of his crime virtually guarantees that he will serve his two years in a 'Club Fed'-style minimum security facility.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons has broad discretion, although it usually factors geography into the equation to place inmates as near to their home as available bed space will allow.  

Virginia is home to two minimum-security federal prisons.

Federal Correctional Institution Petersburg is in Hopewell, Virginia – only 25 miles south of Richmond, where McDonnell was tried.

U.S. Prison Lee in Pennington Gap is 300 miles to the southwest in the Appalachian mountains.

Both places are light on prison guards and host inmates who have greater freedom and more privileges than violent offenders housed elsewhere. 

The BOP's website describes 'minimum security institutions, also known as Federal Prison Camps,' as institutions that 'have dormitory housing, a relatively low staff-to-inmate ratio, and limited or no perimeter fencing.'

'These institutions are work- and program-oriented,' the agency says.

'A number of BOP institutions have a small, minimum security camp adjacent to the main facility. These camps, often referred to as Satellite Prison Camps, provide inmate labor to the main institution and to off-site work programs.'

McDonnell's friends and supporters packed the courthouse before 10 a.m. sentencing hearing on Tuesday.

Supporters included former NFL standout Bruce Smith and several state lawmakers. 

McDonnell's family members – including wife Maureen, also convicted in the scheme – were in attendance as well. She arrived with her two sons, Bobby and Sean.

More than 400 people had written letters asking the judge to spare McDonnell from prison, among them former Democratic Gov. and current U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, co-workers, relatives and neighbors.

Several, including two of the McDonnells' daughters, placed much of the blame with Bob McDonnell's wife.

Daughter Jeanine McDonnell Zubowsky wrote in a letter to the court: 'My mom ... has always been concerned about getting discounts or freebees [sic]. 'She hid her coordination with people for free or discounted things or services and she didn't communicate with my dad because she knew he would not approve. ... The testimony about my mom ... unfortunately, was the reality.'

Zubowsky added that she believed her mother suffers from mental illness, and that her father planned to address her health after leaving office last January. 

Several charities had offered McDonnell volunteer positions, anticipating he might escape prison in favor of a community-service sentence.

Those included religious broadcaster Pat Robertson's Operation Blessing, which had jobs managing a hunger relief program in Appalachia and another working at an orphanage and fish farm in Haiti.

A jury in September found McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, guilty of accepting more than $165,000 but less than $177,000 in loans and gifts – including a Rolex watch and designer clothing – in exchange for promoting a nutritional supplement marketed as a miracle cure by Star Scientific Inc.

Federal Judge James Spencer will decide McDonnell's fate on Tuesday

The company's former CEO, Jonnie Williams, testified under immunity as the prosecution's star witness.

Judge Spencer ruled Tuesday for the purpose of sentencing that the original value of the bribes was overstated, placing the value in the range of $97,000 to $121,000.

And in a second silver lining for McDonnell, he dismissed one criminal count of obstruction of justice.

McDonnell testified in his own defense during the six-week trial, acknowledging he accepted Williams' largesse but claiming he did nothing for him in return other than extend routine political courtesies.

Maureen McDonnell, who did not testify, will be sentenced Feb. 20 on eight counts.

The case prompted the General Assembly to tighten state ethics laws and some Virginia elected officials have voluntarily limited the value of gifts they will accept.

Jonnie Williams testified under an immunity deal in the McDonnell case, admitting that he paid the governor with lavish perks in exchange for helping him secure university backing for his 'miracle cure' products

PINS AND NEEDLES: McDonnell could have gone to prison for ten years

McDonnell, 60, was once considered a possible running mate for Mitt Romney and inspired some talk of a 2016 presidential run of his own.

He delivered the 2010 Republican response to the State of the Union Address and became chairman of the Republican Governors Association in 2011.

He was indicted 10 days after leaving the office once held by Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry.

Former Virginia governor and current US Senator Tim Kaine is among McDonnell's supporters who argue he should be spared prison in favor of a lengthy community-service sentence

At trial, the McDonnells' defense strategy depended in large part on convincing the jury that their marriage was so strained they could not have conspired to squeeze bribes out of Williams.

They arrived at and left the courthouse separately every day and rarely even glanced at each other as they sat separated by lawyers at the defense table.

McDonnell and other witnesses testified about the first lady's erratic behavior, suggesting she was largely responsible for the cozy relationship that developed between the couple and Williams.

They said she was prone to such angry outbursts that the Executive Mansion staff threatened a mass resignation. One acknowledged calling Maureen McDonnell 'a nutbag.'

Prosecutors countered the broken marriage defense by showing the jury photos of the McDonnells holding hands as recently as at pretrial hearings.

Later, in their sentencing recommendation to Spencer, prosecutors sought to turn the strategy against McDonnell by saying he has blamed others for his own misdeeds.

Defense attorneys also claimed Maureen McDonnell developed a 'crush' on Williams, and several witnesses described her relationship with the wealthy vitamin executive as inappropriate and flirtatious.

But nobody suggested the relationship was physical, and Williams testified that his dealings with the McDonnells were all business.
