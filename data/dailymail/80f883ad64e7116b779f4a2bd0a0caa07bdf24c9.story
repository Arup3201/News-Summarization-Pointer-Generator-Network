Claire Orton allegedly commented that an 'extremely poorly' baby was 'better off dead' 

A nurse with a throat infection breathed onto a sick baby's face and said it would be 'better off dead', a tribunal has been told.

Claire Orton allegedly giggled after exhaling onto the 'extremely poorly' child while it was being treated at University Hospital, Coventry.

Orton was being investigated by Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust over a separate incident when the allegations over 'Baby B' came to light.

The Nursing and Midwifery Council hearing heard how Orton was already under investigation for allegedly leaving a student nurse to look after a poorly baby, despite being unqualified to do so.

In that first alleged incident, Orton is accused of not responding promptly to Jade Matthews's calls for help. The child was suffering from brachycardia, a low resting heart rate.

Carolina Cabral, representing the NMC, said the two allegations relate to separate night shifts involving different babies, both on the neonatal ward. 

She said: 'Unfortunately when Baby B was born it was extremely poorly, and was located on the neonatal ward.

'You will hear from one colleague of Ms Orton's that he heard her say to him that Baby B was "better off dead".

'At the time the registrant was not very well, recovering from a throat infection.

'You will hear from this witness that he saw Ms Orton exhale onto Baby B's face and that she thought it was humorous. She then started giggling afterwards.' 

The allegations over the first incident came after a shift on July 1, 2012, in which Orton was working with several colleagues, including Ms Matthews.   

Ms Carbral told the hearing: 'During the course of the shift there was an emergency situation where Baby A became brachycardic, due to a decrease in oxygen saturation levels.

'Jade Matthews will say that she began calling out the decreasing levels of oxygen to the registrant, as she was not qualified to deal with the situation herself.

'Ms Matthews will say that she was sure Ms Orton could hear her, but that she did not come over to assist until the baby's oxygen saturation levels reached 20 percent.

The nurse was working in the neonatal unit at University Hospital, Coventry, when the alleged incidents took place

'The charge is in main that the registrant failed to respond promptly to the emergency situation.'

Orton accepts that a doctor was not called and that she failed to record any notes about the incident.

She later admitted she should not have allowed the student nurse to look after the baby, but thought it was a good learning experience.

Orton denies inappropriately breathing on Baby B's face and saying it would be 'better off dead.' She also denies failing to provide prompt assistance to Ms Matthews in relation to Baby A.

If her fitness to practise is found to be impaired she could be struck off. The hearing continues.
