Luis Suarez is back with Uruguay and flashing those gnashers.

However, there's no chance of him biting anybody - he is just happy to be with his international team-mates as he prepares for his first proper match since sinking his teeth into Italy's Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup.

The former Liverpool hero posted a beaming selfie on the team bus with fellow Uruguay stars Christian Stuani, Martin Silva and Diego Godin as they get ready to face Saudi Arabia on Friday.

Suarez had played a starring role in his country's 2-1 victory over England in the previous game before flying home in disgrace after his implosion against Italy.

Suarez is currently serving the final month of a ban for the incident, but he is permitted to play in friendlies. The centre forward is still banned from Uruguay’s next eight competitive matches.

This means he will miss next year’s Copa America and some World Cup qualifiers. The suspension also covers competitive matches for Barcelona until later this month.

Despite his ban, Barcelona signed up the former Liverpool striker for a club record fee of £75million

Uruguay have just two days rest after the Saudi Arabia clash before taking on Oman on Monday. 

The striker will be available to start against Barca's deadly El Clasico rivals Real Madrid on October 25 and is currently battling to get match fit to start his first La Liga match.

Suarez left Liverpool last season to join Barcelona for a club record fee of £75million.
