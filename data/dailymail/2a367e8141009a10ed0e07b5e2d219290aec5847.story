A millionaire playboy gambler dubbed the Instagram King has allegedly been banned from a Miami nightclub after kicking a woman in the face while dancing on a platform.

Dan Bilzerian, 34, was reportedly filmed celebrating his birthday at LIV Nightclub in Miami, Florida, lashing out at a woman in front of him who tried to break up a fight on Saturday night.

Dim footage shows a figure standing on a podium, dressed in a tight t-shirt moving to music. The tall, muscular figure then leans casually forward and kicks out, after which a crowd of people throng round.

She said: 'There were two girls standing next to me at the table that were fighting. People started getting shoved and I tried to separate them.

'Then Dan pushed me both off the banquette and once I fell he kicked me in the face. I wanted to file a police report and EMT checked my face I was bleeding from my eye but I felt fine and at that point I just wanted to go home.

'I really didn’t see how serious it was until I watched the video for myself. I’m lucky that the injuries weren’t worse. I did nothing to deserve that kick to head, I am gonna go ahead pursue legal action against him.'
