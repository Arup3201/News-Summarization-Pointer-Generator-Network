There have been so many questions from readers about how to disguise pigmentation, redness and fine lines, that this week I’m looking at make-up that hides those annoying signs of ageing.

This month brings new savvy products, including complexion-perfecting creams, to tackle these issues.

Becca’s Ultimate Coverage Complexion Creme (£34, Space NK), gives great coverage to fine lines, redness, pigmentation and other imperfections, and is available in 20 shades.

New look: Reader Helen, 59, loved how young her makeover made her looks

L’Oreal Paris Nude Magique Blur Cream (£9.99, Boots) is non-greasy and comes in green to counteract redness, violet to brighten dull skin and peach to wake up tired skin.

And Avon’s Anew Reversalist Complete Express Wrinkle Smoother (out February 13, £18, avonshop.co.uk) can be used before or after foundation and patted over make-up during the day when you need a retouch. It feels like a balm, but turns to powder on your skin. 

I can also tell you about Studio 10, which launches today. Its smart, slim palettes and pencils deal with age-related issues.

It offers workshops with make-up artists so you can learn how to use colour correctors, highlight like a professional and so on.

Make-up artists will also come to your home so you and a group of friends can learn together.

Reader Helen, 59, from Guildford, Surrey, tried one of these sessions for me.

International make-up artist Mark Cook showed her how to disguise enlarged pores and fine lines, cover age spots and lessen redness, and the tricks of clever contouring and highlighting.

He used the Age Defy Skin Perfector Kit (£32), which includes a primer, colour correctors and two concealers.

After applying primer to smooth fine lines, Mark used green colour corrector to tone down redness and creamy concealer to hide pigmentation.

‘Use a dark, matte shade on areas you want to recede and absorb light, and a highlighter to lift and bring features forward,’ he says.

‘When contouring, use a completely matte product, otherwise it won’t look natural.

‘Start to contour with the darker shade in the hollow of the cheek, below the apple, and blend towards the hairline. Next, create balance by applying the product to the hollows of the temples and forehead.

‘Then, apply highlighter on top of the cheekbones, following the natural contour, and down to the lower cheek.

‘Finish off with the other areas that naturally catch light — the forehead, bridge of the nose, chin and upper lip.

‘Finally, use blusher to add youthful flush. ’

So what did Helen think? ‘It makes me feel the way I used to when I felt good about myself,’ she says.

Exfoliate: Ragdale Hall Luxurious Spa Body Butter

SCRUB IT BETTER

Ragdale Hall’s Invigorating Spa Shower Scrub is formulated with bamboo and pumice extracts for a gentle exfoliation.

Unlike the usual salt and sugar scrubs, these natural exfoliates do not dissolve in water, but  ‘stick’ to the skin for a quicker, easier and more effective treatment.

Therapists at the Leicestershire-based spa advise applying the scrub  to damp skin  in circular movements, paying particular attention to dry areas such as the knees and elbows, before  rinsing off. This should be done once or twice a week.

For best results, follow with a generous application of the brand’s Luxurious Spa  Body Butter. The scrub (£6.50 for 200ml) and body butter (£8.50  for 200ml) are available exclusively at Marks &  Spencer, instore or at marksandspencer.com.

FEED YOUR HAIR

Nourish: Weleda's Oat Replenishing Treatment

Weleda’s Skin Food has long been a celebrity favourite. Now the brand has launched a range to ‘feed’ hair with organic nutrients and oils to leave it smooth, shiny and healthy.

The newest addition is Oat Replenishing Treatment, (£11.50, Waitrose), a thick and nourishing hair mask to help undo all the damage wrought by heat styling, frequent shampooing and products.

With shea butter and organic oat extracts, it can be used as a 20-minute mask, with hair wrapped in a towel, as an overnight treatment or before shampooing.

It doesn’t weigh down your hair as long as you wash it out thoroughly.

The rest of the range, including shampoo, starts at £8.95.

UNSUNG HERO

Refresh: DHC Revitalizing Moisture Strips

A quick fix for puffy eyes is always welcome.

Japanese brand DHC’s Revitalizing Moisture Strips are soft gel masks which, when worn for 20 to 30 minutes, perk up the delicate skin around the eyes.

They contain mulberry and antioxidant olive leaf extract (£6.95, dhcuk.co.uk).

BARGAIN BUY

Colour: B. Vibrant Lip and Cheek Colour

The new B. Vibrant Lip and Cheek Colour (£6.99, Superdrug) is slimmer than a Clinique Chubby Stick, but fatter than a lipliner.

The five bright shades are rich and creamy with amazing staying power.

For lips, build up the colour by blotting after the first application and reapplying.

Gently blend with your fingertips onto the apples of the cheeks for a flush of colour.
