A toddler has been struck down with a mysterious illness which will eventually leave her completely unable to move - turning her into a living statue.

Beatrice Naso has a room full of toys and teddy bears but the devastating disease means the three-year-old is unable to play with any of them.

The child from Turin, Italy, was a perfectly normal baby but developed the mystery illness when she was just seven-months-old.

Beatrice, three, was a normal baby until she was seven-months-old. She is pictured with her parents Alessando and Stefania

Beatrice's mother (pictured) first realised there was a problem when her daughter started to look stiff

Her parents, Alessando and Stefania Naso, first noticed there was a problem when Beatrice started looking stiff, days later her mother was gently massaging her wrist when it broke.

Doctors examined Beatrice and discovered that her body was calcifying her soft tissue, turning her into a living statue.

Surgeons at the Regina Margherita Hospital are now appealing to fellow medics worldwide to see if they can find a cure for the toddler.

Her parents have also turned to Turin mayor, Piero Fassino, for help with a new specially designed house for Beatrice.

Her mother, Stefania, said: ‘Doctors at the hospital are doing their best but we're desperate to find someone that can help or even another family who have a child with the same condition so they can help us cope with the situation.

‘Doctors have told us that it's a genetic anomaly which they've never seen before. It calcifies everything surrounding the joints.

When she was seven-months-old Beatrice's mother was massaging her wrist and it broke

Beatrice cannot play with her toys because her movement is severely restricted by the condition

‘I had a completely normal pregnancy and there was no sign that anything was wrong.

‘During the first few months of her life though she started to look a little more stiff than other babies and she couldn't open her hands.

‘Initial exams didn't bring up any problems though so we weren't scared.

Her doctors are appealing for help finding a cure

‘It was only at seven-months-old when I was massaging her after a bath that I broke her wrist and realised something was really wrong.’

She added: ‘Doctors then did an X-ray of her entire body and discovered the strange calcifications.

‘The illness will just keep getting worse. Sooner or later she will be completely unable to move and she won't even be able to breathe anymore.

‘We are now trying to find a new house where it will be easier to move Beatrice around.

‘We could sell our current house but we will have to repay the mortgage and that will leave us with no money to invest in somewhere new.’
