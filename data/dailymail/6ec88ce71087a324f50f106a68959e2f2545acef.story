 BONY ON CITY'S RADAR?

Wilfried Bony has been mentioned as a possible target, or maybe Manuel Pellegrini plans to spice things up by bringing Mario Balotelli back to the Etihad?

RED MIST FOR SHELVEY 

Jonjo Shelvey, who joined Swansea from Liverpool for £5m last summer, was restored to the starting line-up after being criticised by Garry Monk for his ‘laziness’ and lack of discipline, but will not have impressed his manager with a reckless arm into the face of Emre Can in the first half.

 BAD OMENS CONTINUE FOR SWANSEA

Liverpool might have started the night three points behind their opponents in the Premier League table but Swansea’s record in the league at Anfield did not augur well for Monk’s team. 

The two clubs had met here 13 times down the years, resulting in 10 Liverpool wins and three draws.

 SPANISH DELIGHT FOR REDS

Alberto Moreno's goal was his second for Liverpool and his first at Anfield, but no other Premier League club have had more Spanish scorers among their ranks. 

Liverpool’s total of 114 is well ahead of Arsenal on 87, with Fernando Torres alone weighing in with 65.

 MONTERO BLOW FOR SWANS

Swansea winger Jefferson Montero will be out of action for at least a month after suffering a hamstring strain in the Boxing Day win over Aston Villa, his club confirmed on Monday night. 

The Ecuador winger, who signed from Mexican club Morelia for £4m in the summer, has been in fine form since making his full Premier League debut in October.

NEW SHORTS NEEDED FOR WAYNE 

Wayne Routledge needed a new pair of shorts after being taken down by a challenge from Martin Skrtel that would not have been out of place at Twickenham. 

It brought a yellow card for the Liverpool defender and a brief delay while the Swansea winger sorted out his wardrobe malfunction.
