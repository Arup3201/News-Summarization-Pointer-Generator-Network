Jailed: Juraj Orsula, 46, claimed he had been blinded by the sun when his red Mercedes Actros lorry crashed into the back of queuing traffic

A Slovakian lorry driver who killed three members of the same family and injured eight others after ploughing into the back of stationary traffic on a motorway has been jailed.

Juraj Orsula, 46, claimed he had been blinded by the sun when his red Mercedes Actros lorry crashed into the back of queuing traffic, which had built up on the M26 in Kemsing, Kent, after two previous collisions earlier that morning.

Helen Akande, 22, and her sister Mary, 16, both students from Sarcelles, France, died at the scene of the crash in April last year, while their father Michael, 54, died two weeks later in hospital as a result of his injuries.

Three people in another vehicle suffered serious injuries, including a boy aged seven who suffered a severe brain injury, a boy aged three who had a broken leg and a 36-year-old man with a fractured skull and brain injury.

Orsula, of Topolcany, Slovakia, pleaded guilty at Maidstone Crown Court yesterday to three counts of causing death by dangerous driving, and three counts of causing serious injury while driving dangerously.

He was jailed for six and a half years, and disqualified from driving for seven years.

Detective Constable David Holmes, from Kent Police, said: ‘The events of that day will linger long in the memory of those affected, some of whom will never fully recover from their injuries.

‘Juraj Orsula claims he was blinded by the sun in the moments leading up to the collision, which should have been reason enough to reduce his speed.

‘Instead he continued to drive as normal before crashing into stationary traffic and leaving a trail of devastation. He must now live with the consequences of his actions for the rest of his life.’ 

Mr Holmes added: 'Hopefully Orsula's sentencing will mark the start of the healing process for everyone affected by this devastating incident, and our thoughts are with them all today.'
