Not for the first time, I have been inspired by Jerry Hall. I adored her so much back in my early 20s that I made and hand-painted an exact copy of the fabulous black and gold tiger-print dress she wore in the video of Bryan Ferry’s single Let’s Stick Together.

So when I read that she'd cleared out her wardrobe to sell her stash of designer clothes for charity I decided to follow suit.

The problem is, I don't have one wardrobe, I have seven - three in my bedroom, three in my study and, just for luck, one more in the guest bedroom.

Raiding her wardrobe: Amanda has a lot of clothes so will she finally be able to give some away?

In my defence, I'm not a prolific shopper, but I am a hoarder and hitherto incapable of throwing anything out - after all, every piece in my wardrobe conjures up memories of the times I wore it.

Twice a year, I swap between summer and winter clothes, keeping the seasonal ones in my study and the off-season ones in the bedroom.

One whole wardrobe is an overflow, and I confess I haven't worn any of the pieces hanging in it for at least six years. This is obviously where my clearout should start, but would I be able to part with anything?

Black night: Within weeks of wearing this, Amanda left her partner

THE BIG BREAK UP 

I bought this exquisitely embroidered, draped Alberta Ferretti sequined black top and lace skirt for my ex-partner's 50th birthday party nearly seven years ago. 

It cost £500 and the colour should have been a clue.

During the speech I made, paying tribute to his many great qualities, I kept breaking down in tears. 

Guests came up to me afterwards and said it was so touching, so very moving.

Little did they know they were tears of sorrow, not joy, because I knew I was soon to leave him. Within weeks he had moved out.

I can't wear this outfit again, but hope it brings happiness to some poor unsuspecting soul.

Too young: This outfit has to go

MAJOR WARDROBE MALFUNCTION

I bought this stripy skirt from Reiss about five years ago for £80. 

It has never been worn, unsurprisingly, and looks more like a belt than a skirt. 

What was I thinking?

I bought it during a skinny phase and thought I could get away with anything.

I did put it on a few times planning to wear it, but one glimpse in the mirror and I knew it was all wrong for me - too short, too obvious, too young and not a little tarty.

The Agnes B red cardigan is one of those items you buy thinking 'I'll get lots of wear out of this' but I never have.

The front-fastening gapes and the buttons constantly break free creating serious cleavage malfunction.

Charity bag it is.

Memory: This top reminds Amanda of a once happy relationship

MEMENTO OF MARRIAGE

I picked up this classic stripy top for my then fiance John at a market in Sydney 30 years ago. 

It cost $5 and is still as good as new.

Our marriage ended very sadly just four years later, but this top reminds me of the happier times we had in the Australian sunshine, falling in love and frolicking in the sun without a care in the world.

We both used to wear it, and it is the only thing of his I have kept.

The wedding ring I returned, the engagement and eternity ring I pawned and gave the money to a homeless old lady who lived in a doorway near where I worked in Pimlico.

I won't ever wear this top again, but I can't chuck it either - it reminds that even failed relationships begin with love.

Back it goes.

Online mistake: A regrettable purchase

DON'T DRINK AND SHOP

This £200 black and white fur trimmed Nanette Lepore cardigan was one of my many online mistakes.

Rule one for online shopping - never even contemplate it after a couple of glasses of wine.

I’m a bit of an online ingénue, sticking to designers such as Amanda Wakeley or Nanette Lepore as their sizes are constant.

 I also get my Myla bras and knickers online, partly as I loathe underwear shopping and they always fit.

This cardigan looked fabulous on a young model, but it makes me look like a little old lady collecting her pension at the Post Office.

This is all wrong for me, but hopefully it will be just right for a grateful granny.

Issa not working for me: Amanda won't keep this wrap dress

LOOKS GOOD ON KATE BUT NOT ON ME

I fell in love with this dazzling Issa dress when I bought it about eight years ago, with a hefty price-tag of nearly £500.

Yes I know Kate swears by these faux-wrap dresses - and, yes, I know the cut and draping are ludicrously flattering, but they're just so middle-aged.

With its bold bright green, yellow, blue, white and black pattern, one male friend said it made me look like an exotic butterfly emerging from the forest. 

Another suggested a giant dragonfly. Ouch! 

It fits perfectly, and is very slimming, but who wants to look like an insect, stick-like or not?

Out!

Winter warmer: But Amanda is passing this coat on

THE LESSER SPOTTED YETI

This fluffy coat, bought for £120 in the sale at Fenwick's 15 years ago, always made me feel like a teenager. 

Despite the unusual grey, blue and pink mottled fake fur, it felt glamorous with jeans or a dress.

One of the reasons I loved this coat was that it was such a change from my beloved timeless Nicole Farhi black wool and fake fur coat or my navy swing coat - they were for work, my yeti was for fun and I wore it for years.

And while my girlfriends thought it was cool, one male friend said it made me look like a moth-eaten taxidermied bear.

Trying it on again now, I realise it is just too young for me these days. 

Let's hope it keeps some twentysomething warm and happy this winter.

Date dress: Now for her boyfriend's eyes only

MY 'COME AND GET ME' FROCK

Now, I love this £250 red Nanette Lapore dress and actually think it's quite flattering, but my boyfriend hates it. 

I know we shouldn't be influenced by what our men think, but we are.

Anyway, it's not that he doesn't like it. He loves it, but only when I wear it with him. 

He describes it as a 'date dress', but he actually means it's a come-and-get-me frock.

It does pre-date him, so to speak, and I have a hunch that's why he dislikes it so much, for the mere reminder that I ever dated anyone else. Silly thing.

I'll admit that the colour is rather obvious, and the neckline a bit Marie Antoinette, but on reflection I refuse to give this one away.

Back it goes - for his eyes only.

Sadness: Amanda wore this to deliver tragic news

TOO PAINFUL TO PART WITH

It's funny what you come across when you search through your wardrobe - the good, the bad, and the unbelievably painful. 

To anyone else's eye, this £20 khaki linen sundress would be first on the reject pile. And I did contemplate losing it - for a moment - but it stays.

I last wore it nearly 20 years ago. The phone rang before 6am on an already stinking hot day in Perth. 

It was my brother Michael's wife telling me the news we'd been expecting but would never be ready to hear.

He had died in the night. Frantic to get dressed to make our last visit, I was keen not to offend by wearing anything inappropriate.

So I chose this modest dress then walked into Mum and Dad's room, where they were curled up together asleep, to tell them.

Michael's last words to me the night before he died were 'see ya', something I intend never to say to this dress, so plain to the eye but so embedded in the heart.

Best forgotten: This was worn during an embarrassing public blunder

NIGHT THAT MAKES ME CRINGE

This Kenzo dress cost a whopping £500 when I bought it for the Sony radio awards in 2003, to announce the prize for best talk radio presenter.

A simple enough task you might think, reading out three names in reverse order.

And yet when the moment came, for some unfathomable reason I decided to pay my own personal tribute to Five Live's Victoria Derbyshire (who hadn't even been placed in the top three).

No sooner had the words 'the wonderful Victoria Derbyshire' left my lips than she and her team were on their feet, hugging each other and heading for the stage.

I had to shoo them back and announce the real winner, whose name escapes me to this day, but the shame lives on. 

The host Paul Gambaccini whispered in my ear that it was the biggest disaster he had ever witnessed at an awards show.

Little wonder I've never been able to wear it since. Top of the reject pile it goes.
