You could be forgiven for thinking that celebrity chef Pete Evans would live in a sleek and modern luxury house, but the Paleo guru appears to have bought himself a sprawling rural property out in tiny town.

Nestled in the heart of the Northern Rivers region of NSW, the homely 10-hectare property on Kanes Road, Round Mountain, was secretly snapped up by Evans in December.

Property records indicate that the $1.2million sale went through on behalf of P.Evans Property Ltd, a company linked to Peter Daryl Evans.

News Corp reported that the sale included three separate living areas- a three-bedroom residence, a converted barn with three bedrooms, and a converted shed with two bedrooms.

The main residence also boasts two bedrooms and living rooms, as well as a timber kitchen with tiled floors, stained-glass cupboards and an island.

The spacious living area opens to the backyard, and offers plenty of room for entertaining.

The house also features a spacious outdoor entertaining area, leading down to three dams on the property.

The American-style barn has been converted to three bedrooms, featuring a wide open space for chairs and tables, offering a spectacular panoramic view of the property.

The barn has exposed beams in the ceiling, as well as a private, in-built bar.

The converted shed now operates independently as a granny flat.

Evans was encouraged to take on the Paleo lifestyle by his fiancee Nicola Robinson, a former glamour model

A two-car open garage sits on the generously spaced property, surrounded by country pastures and other farms. 

In 2009, Evans was living in a property in Bondi Beach, which comprised two adjoining apartments, reported The Daily Telegraph.

While his restaurants feature sleek interiors and minimalist presentation, this sprawling property is no-fuss or frills.  

The house appears to be in character for the outspoken media personality and My Kitchen Rules judge, who has commented in the past about his love of organic food, including 'activated' almonds.

Evans, a proponent of the controversial Paleo Diet, may be looking to start his own hobby farm to grow his own organic produce.

The property was advertised as 'usable acreage', and has the potential to support the kind of lifestyle Evans promotes through his books and education programs.

Evans' book 'The Paleo Chef' was a hit within Australia, supporting the regime known as the Paleolithic Diet, the Caveman diet and the Stone Age Diet, which involves no processed foods, no sugar, no dairy, no grains, and no legumes.

‘It’s about sourcing the most natural, locally-sourced ingredients possible, combining moderate amounts of protein with good-quality,’ Evans told Daily Mail Australia in January.

Evans was encouraged to take on the Paleo lifestyle by his fiancee Nicola Robinson, a former glamour model. 

'I can remember Nic was sitting next to me reading [Primal Body, Primal Mind by Nora Gedgaudas] one night and I felt a sudden jab in my ribs,' he writes in his own book Going Paleo. 

'She had this look in her eye and I knew she had stumbled onto something powerful.'

Nicola, who he calls his 'wife' in his latest book, started dating the father-of-two shortly after he announced his split from his wife of 11 years Astrid Ellinger in 2011.

‘I also like to add in a side of fermented veg with most meals that I eat as it’s full of healthy lactic acid so really helps to aid with both digestion and allowing the body to absorb the maximum amount of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and fatty acids from each meal.’

Evans has just launched an Australian-first online 10-week The Paleo Way program in a bid to help all Australians who want to activate the Paleo lifestyle. 

As the property also comes with three dams, Evans would be in a prime position to drink flouride-free water. 

Evans has been slammed for his anti-fluoride campaign in Western Australia, enraging medical professionals who have described his standpoint as misinformed and a potentially dangerous lifestyle choice.

Evans proudly adorned a 'Fluoride Free WA' t-shirt on Facebook to promote the Perth-based lobby group's cause.
