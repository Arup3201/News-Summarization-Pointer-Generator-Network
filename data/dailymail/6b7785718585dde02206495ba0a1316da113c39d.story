Russian television makers have been accused of using an actress to pose as at least five different women opposed to the revolution in Ukraine.

The blonde woman was seen on television broadcasts as an aggrieved housewife in Odessa, describing her terror at the 'pro-fascist' politicians who grabbed power in Ukraine during last month's revolution.

However, many social network users were quick to notice that the 'housewife' bears an uncanny resemblance to several other women interviewed - prompting accusations that she is an actress hired to sow discord in Ukraine and stoke pro-Moscow groups to incite people against the Kiev authorities.

Similarities: Many social network users were quick to notice that the 'housewife' bears an uncanny resemblance to four other women interviewed

It is alleged that the woman, believed to be 40, also appeared as a soldier's mother on the barricades in Kiev, and was seen wrapped in a Russian flag in Kharkov.

Ukrainian media outlets, who describe her as a 'well known guest actress', say she has also  appeared in protests in Sevastopol in Crimea and Norocherkassk in Russia.

She regularly appeals for Russian 
help for pro-Moscow Ukrainians, it has been claimed, and speaks of persecution in her 
country, leading to claims she is a warrior in Putin's propaganda army.

Last night, LifeNews website in Russia was alleged to have featured the same woman in a broadcast, where this time she was named as mother-of-three Tatiana Samoilenko.

This time she had darker hair, although there was no immediate confirmation of her identity or past history.

She told how she had to flee Ukraine with her Russian husband and three young children.

However, it is unclear when she actually did so, because if she is indeed the same woman who appeared in previous shows she would have been so busy in recent days being filmed at pro-Russian protests.

Ukrainians have accused Russia of paying hired hecklers to stir up dissent or occupy government buildings. Hundreds of 'Putin tourists' are alleged to have flown in since the troubles began in Ukraine.

'We are a mixed family, my husband is a citizen of Russia, I am Ukrainian,' she was quoted as saying.

'When those pro-fascist politicians got power, we did not think  for long. We decided to go to Russia. We quickly understood we had no time to waste, or it could get worse.'

She told how the family had to leave behind everything - property, good jobs, money on bank accounts, because they were forbidden to take cash out, an allegation Ukrainians say is 'absurd'.

She alleged: 'We understood very well that if we leave all we have behind, we would need to start from the very beginning in the new country.

'Despite of my long experience of working in managerial positions and with two university educations, I am not scared that probably I will have to sweep the floors in a  school.'

The woman told how she suffered not only in revolutionary Kiev but also in Russian-speaking Donetsk.

'We were stopped at a checkpoint. People in masks ordered us out of the car.

'We asked "who are you?" They were rude and demanded we speak only Ukrainian.

'Then they hit our car with sticks and kicked it.'

She claimed they survived only because she can speak Ukrainian and that all her documents were in order.

'Fortunately, I had documents proving we are a family with three children, we do not want anything, we are just leaving their country, so they let us go,' she said.
