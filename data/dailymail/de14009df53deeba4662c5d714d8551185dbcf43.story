A Florida man was arrested this week after being accused of stealing a woman’s horse and slapping paint over its white markings in a ruse meant to cover his tracks and fool the animal's owner.

Bullet the horse found itself in the middle of a heated custody battle between Raphine Pierce, of Lake Helen, Florida, and Thomas Pugliese,, 46, who ended up behind bars over allegations of equine theft. 

Bullet was given to Pierce in July by Pugliese’s mother, who said she could not longer care for the animal, Orlando Sentinel reported.

However, about 10 days later, the 
horse vanished from Pierce’s pasture. The woman reported the animal 
missing and told police that she suspected that Pugliese’s daughter was 
behind it.

On August 13, 
weeks after filing her report, Pierce said she spotted Bullet on 
Pugliese’s property. The only problem was that the white, diamond-shaped
marking on the critter’s forehead was gone.

According to Pierce, the tell-tale 
sign had been dyed brown to match the rest of Bullet’s body, along with 
other characteristic markings.

When Lake Helen police approached 
Pugliese about the horse and his daughter's suspected involvement in his disappearance, the man blocked his
driveway with a truck and claimed that the horse seen prancing on his property was not 
Bullet, according to a police report.

Pugliese refused to let officers onto his land, so they sought a search warrant.

While
Owen was waiting for the warrant to arrive, Pierce, who was also on the
scene, said she saw Pugliese’s daughter flee on the horse into the 
woods.

Authorities said they
later learned that Pugliese told his daughter to ride off and hide the 
animal, according to a Volusia County Sheriff’s Office report.

After
an hour, Owen became concerned that the teenager may have gotten lost 
in the dense brush, but her father would not report her as missing. The 
girl was eventually found, but without Bullet.

According to police, it is unclear who
legally owns Bullet. Pugliese could not produce any documents proving 
that he is Bullet’s owner, while Pierce is in possession of the horse’s 
medical records and registration information, Officer Scott Owen said.

Equine ruse: Raphine Pierce claimed that Pugliese stole Bullet from her pasture and painted the white star on its forehead and other markings brown to match the rest of the animal

Police said Pugliese told them: ‘You aren’t going to get that horse back even if it means I have to take the ride to Daytona,’ referring to the Volusia County Jail.

He was arrested and charged with felony grand theft of a farm animal, tampering with evidence and child neglect without great harm.
