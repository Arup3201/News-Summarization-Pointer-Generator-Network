As New York finally gets a relief from the Arctic chill,Â  the aftermath of the polar vortex has left a deep fog shrouding the city and New Jersey.

The deep freeze caused record low temperatures across the US but a sudden rise in temperatures left much of the country covered in thick fog.

In New York City temperatures hit around 7C (44F) marking an almighty swing from the freezing snow and winds which grounded more than 11,000 flights in America.

Deep fog: These are the otherworldly images which show the aftermath of the polar vortex in New York - a deep fog which has shrouded the city looking like something out of a science fiction film

The spectacular shots, captured by keen photographer Jay Fine, were taken over the weekend.

He said: 'This most recent fog made Jersey City entirely disappear - a stranger standing on the New York side of the Hudson River by Battery Park City would not know they were facing the largest building in all of New Jersey.

'The Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island were also gone much to the annoyance of the few tourists out over the weekend.

'Looking out my window was like staring into a wall of cotton wool. There's nothing to orient you to your surroundings. Outside is devoid of detail, scale or perspective,' said the photographer

'Instead of shots of the Statue they had to content themselves with using their iPhones to take photos of nothing.

'Looking out my window was like staring into a wall of cotton wool. There's nothing to orient you to your surroundings. Outside is devoid of detail, scale or perspective.

'When the fog knocks out visibility we get an ad hoc composition of deep bass notes from the tugs, tour boats and occasional cruise ship.

'Yesterday it sounded like the scene in ET where the humans greet the alien ship.

'Every few years a massive fog that rolls in from the harbour and down the streets of lower Manhattan makes you feel like you're in a science fiction movie of your own making.'
