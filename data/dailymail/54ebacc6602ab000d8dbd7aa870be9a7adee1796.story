Shooter: Eddie Ray Routh, 25, was arrested for allegedly shooting two people dead, including the 'deadliest sniper' in U.S. Military history

The deadliest sniper in US history has been shot dead at point blank range by a veteran suffering from post traumatic stress disorder.

Chris Kyle, 39, was blasted in the back by Eddie Ray Routh, 25, after taking him on an outing to a shooting range to help him deal with his demons.

Routh also allegedly shot dead his neighbor Chad Littlefield, 35, who was on the trip too.

Kyle’s death sparked a huge outpouring of tributes across America with many saying that he was a ‘true American hero’.

He notched up 255 kills during the Iraq war and became so feared by insurgents they put a $80,000 bounty on his head and nicknamed him al-Shaitan Ramad, or ‘the Devil of Ramadi’.

In one battle alone he shot dead 40 enemy soldiers although his greatest achievement was his longest kill - from a staggering 1.2 miles away.

Kyle told of his career in his memoir called ‘American Sniper’ which went on sale last month and became an instant bestseller.

He also worked with with veterans charity the FITCO Cares Foundation, which is where he appears to have come into contact with Routh.

The shooting happened at the Rough Creek Lodge near Stephenville in Texas on Saturday evening.

Routh is said to have ‘turned on’ his two victims and shot them before tried to flee the scene in Kyle’s pickup truck.

The former marine - who was reportedly highly trained in the use of firearms - was arrested around 9pm following a chase and is now in custody.

Kyle, 39, served four tours in Irag and he was awarded two Silver Stars, five Bronze Stars with Valor, two Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals, and one Navy and Marine Corps Commendation

Caught: Police searched for Routh for hours following the shooting on Saturday afternoon and he allegedly fled the scene at the shooting range, taking off in Kyle's pick up truck

In custody: Routh is seen here wearing black being put into the back of a police car

Routh is now expected to be charged with capital murder over the double shooting.

Erath County Sheriff Tommy Bryant said that he had ‘no clue’ as to the motive but US reports focused on Routh’s PTSD.

In interviews Kyle himself has told of how hard it is to leave the military and said it left you with ‘no identity’.

He left the service in 2009 in order to save his marriage to wife Taya and spend more time with their two children.

While in Iraq, Kyle survived being shot twice 
and he lived through six separate IED explosions as his unit, Charlie 
company of SEAL Team Three, saw significant combat

Kyle recorded more than 150 sniper kills - the most in U.S. military history - between 1999 and 2009

Until then his life seemed like a film script and with his death the chances of Hollywood coming calling have increased dramatically.

Kyle grew up in Texas and in his youth was a professional bronco rider who dreamed of becoming a cowboy.

Instead he became a soldier and when faced with his first kill - an Iraqi woman armed with a hand grenade - he was so reticent he had to be ordered to shoot by his commander.

That anxiety soon disappeared and during his 10 year military career as a member of the elite SEAL Team 3 he survived being shot twice, lost two of his closest friends and lived through six near-death explosions.

Scene: The shooting happened at the Rough Creek Lodge near Stephenville in Texas on Saturday evening

He saw action in every major battle during Operation Iraqi Freedom using his trusty .300 Win Mag, a bolt-action precision sniper rifle which he said would ‘shoot like a laser’.

Kyle, whose parents are a Sunday school teacher and a church deacon, has said he had no regrets about his life and claimed to have a ‘clear conscience’ before God.

In his memoir he said: ‘It was my duty to shoot the enemy, and I don't regret it.

‘My regrets are for the people I couldn't save: Marines, soldiers, buddies...

Kyle, a husband and father of two, authored the New York Times best-seller 'American Sniper,' which chronicled his four tours in Iraq

Ex-Navy Seal Chris Kyle, author of 'American Sniper,' and a neighbor of his were shot point-blank by another veteran

‘...After the first kill, the others 
come easy. I don’t have to psych myself up, or do anything mentally - I 
look through the scope, get the target in the cross hairs and kill my 
enemy before he kills one of my people.’

Kyle’s feat puts him amongst the sniping elite, but he is far from the best in history.

That
title falls to Finland’s Simo Häyhä who shot dead 542 Soviet soldiers 
during World War II, earning him the nickname ‘White Death’.

The longest shot ever taken was in November 2009 by British soldier Craig Harrison.

After leaving the Navy, he started his own military contracting firm, Craft International, which provides military and law enforcement sniper training

This is the Rough Creek Lodge gun range where Kyle was shot

The
Household Cavalryman hit two Taliban fighters from 3,000ft, the length 
of 25 football pitches - outside of his weapon’s effective range.

Kyle’s
death comes at a time when gun laws are under the microscope in the US 
with President Barack Obama trying to clamp down on the sale of assault 
rifles.

ABC News reported that senior military commanders and former colleagues of Kyle were heartbroken at the death of a ‘legend’.

On
Twitter however some claimed his death was due to bad karma and a 
Democrat-voting Christian called Patricia wrote that he ‘had it coming’.
