David Cameron will today urge the English to embrace Scotland in the run-up to the crunch independence referendum this autumn.

The Prime Minister will use his annual St George's Day message to promote the union with Scotland, calling it 'one of England's greatest achievements'.

At the same time, Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond will make a rare speech in England – also to mark St George's day.

At an event in Carlisle this evening, he will claim that England will remain 'Scotland's closest friends', even if his country votes to break up the UK in September.

Both politicians are desperate to win the battle for hearts in a debate that has so far been dominated by economic claims and counter-claims.

Mr Cameron will describe the UK as 'the world's greatest family of nations'.

In a video message he will say: 'Let's prove that we can be proud of our individual nations and be committed to our union of nations. Because no matter how great we are alone, we will always be greater together.'

Mr Cameron's unusual decision to use his St George's Day message to discuss Scotland reflects growing nervousness in Downing Street, as a recent poll showed support for separation is now only three points behind support for the union.

Mr Salmond will claim today that an independent Scotland could help to regenerate the North of England by providing a counterweight to London.

The SNP leader will insist that people could still live in England and work in Scotland if there is a Yes vote – ignoring warnings of passport controls.

'The ties that bind the nations of these islands will continue and flourish after Scotland becomes independent,' Mr Salmond will say.

'You will remain Scotland's closest friends, as well as our closest neighbours ... people would still live in Annan and work in Carlisle, or live in Penrith and work in Lockerbie. Friends and family would continue to visit each other.'

Gordon Brown yesterday made his first intervention on behalf of the pro-union Better Together campaign.

In a speech in Glasgow, the former Prime Minister warned that Scotland faces a £700million pensions 'timebomb' if it votes for independence.

Rather than pulling apart, he called for the Scottish parliament to be enshrined in a British constitution, creating a 'power-sharing partnership' with Westminster.'
