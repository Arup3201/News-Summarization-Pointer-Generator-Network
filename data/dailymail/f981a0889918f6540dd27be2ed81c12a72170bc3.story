Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari has denied allegations of tax evasion.

The Portuguese government, according to Brazilian newspaper Folha de S.Paulo, are investigating Scolari over €7million (£5.7m) of unreported income.

'I have filed all my tax returns correctly,' said Scolari in a statement.

Probe: Portuguese officials say Luiz Felipe Scolari is under criminal investigation

Denial: Scolari, in charge of Portugal from 2003 to 2008, says he declared all his income correctly

'In every
 country that I've worked, I've always claimed my income. I'm absolutely
 sure that I've filed all my tax returns correctly.

'If there's something wrong, it's not with me. The justice system will narrow the facts.'

The claim dates back to when Scolari was in charge of the Portugal national team between 2003 and 2008.

The 65-year-old, who managed Chelsea after his spell as Portugal boss, has just named his 23-man squad for the World Cup on home soil.

Scolari led Brazil to the trophy in 2002 and is bidding for a repeat when the tournament kicks off on June 12 with a match against Croatia in Sao Paulo.
