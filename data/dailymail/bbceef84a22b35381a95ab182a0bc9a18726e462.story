Rail passengers told last night how they feared a Hillsborough-style disaster when thousands were trapped inside a station as travel chaos hit Britain – and the severe weather added to the Christmas misery for millions.

The mayhem across the rail network was caused by overrunning engineering works at some of the country's busiest stations – to the fury of Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin who last night read the riot act to Network Rail's chief executive.

The most chaotic scenes were at the Finsbury Park station in North London yesterday, which had to be closed by police for two hours from 11am because so many travellers had been diverted there from the much larger King's Cross.

Passengers were left stranded outside Finsbury Park, which shut when it was overwhelmed by crowds

There was also chaos at London Waterloo on the day there was mayhem across the rail network 

Passengers faced long queues at Finsbury Park in North London - the station later closed amid safety fears

The announcement that King's Cross services were being affected only came late on Boxing Day and gave passengers little time to change their travel plans.

Margaret Sims, 67, who was caught up in the crush as she tried to travel home to Leeds, told The Mail on Sunday: 'The platform was jammed with people trying to get off the train. It was a Hillsborough situation.'

Susan Delgado, 57, from North London, who abandoned plans to visit friends in Cambridge, said: 'It was really unpleasant and jam-packed – some platforms were completely full of people right to the edge. I called the police at 10am but it took them so long to take any action.

'Finsbury Park is a small station on a suburban line. Sending everyone there from King's Cross – a major transport hub – was absolutely ludicrous and quite dangerous. Heads should roll.'

Train passengers are braced for a second day of travel misery as it is announced workers at King's Cross will toil through the night in an attempt to open the station tomorrow

King's Cross was closed due to the overrunning works, with thousands of commuters directed to Finsbury Park station instead

Hundreds of travellers reported being left outside the station for up to 90 minutes in freezing wind and rain as a dozen station staff were overwhelmed by the crowds  

Outraged Mr McLoughlin last night said the situation was 'totally unacceptable' in a frank phone call to Mark Carne, the £675,000-a-year chief executive of Network Rail. The company receives £3.2 billion of taxpayers' money each year to maintain the tracks.

Mr McLoughlin said: 'The situation on the railways this weekend has been totally unacceptable. Passengers must be able to trust that vital engineering works will be completed on time.'

An investigation was launched by the rail watchdog, the Office of the Rail Regulator, to establish why the planned maintenance works failed to be completed on time despite thousands of engineers toiling around the clock on Christmas Day and Boxing Day. 

In the worst day of disruption this winter, ice and snow in the north of England and the Midlands caused havoc on the roads, left 100,000 homes without power and led to the cancellation of scores of flights. 

However, rail passengers suffered the most with hours of delays.  

Speaking to Mail Online, passenger Dean Pugh, who was travelling from Darlington, said: 'Our train was packed. When it arrived there were around a thousand or so people trying to get on it to head north, using the same stairs we were using to get off.

'Everything came to a standstill for 45 minutes before anyone took charge. At first they tried to push us to the back of the platform to get people on to the train, then held boarding passengers back and let us go.

'There were around a dozen East Coast staff and a dozen police officers there, but they were both asking one another what to do and nobody was taking charge.' 

Network Rail, who are responsible for the engineering works, said labourers will stay on site overnight and hope to have a reduced service running tomorrow

No more snow is forecast for Britain next week, but there was relief yesterday for thousands of UK skiers who went abroad desperate to find it – the biggest falls of the season so far have transformed barren slopes in the Alps. 

Andrew Frawley, of chalet company Nomadic Ski in Chamonix in the French Alps, said: 'Christmas was tough with the lack of snow but New Year guests are going to have a wonderful time.'

Jim Ewing, who was trying to travel to Edinburgh from London, said: 'I got off at Finsbury Park tube station and waited in a queue for half an hour with no information, before one staff member appeared and asked everyone to move back.

'There wasn't much room so that raised a few grumbles but everyone was generally in good spirits, however after an hour stuck in a tunnel and moving just 20ft the police appeared.

'We were told we had to wait for a platform to be cleared, and had to stand for another 20 minutes in the tunnels.

'Eventually we made it on to the platform and I was very relieved to be back in the fresh air.'

George Hallam, a semi-retired economics lecturer from Lewisham, was among the crowds waiting to get on a train at Finsbury Park.

He said: 'Any civil engineering contractor would have realised probably weeks ago that they were going to overrun and they must have realised they would be fined.

'They could have solved that by putting on more resources, more people, more machines - but if the cost of that is more than the fine then they would choose to pay the fine.

'The staff are telling people the problem, but not the extent of it. People are still arriving and waiting in the cold.

'There are a lot of vulnerable people here. My mother-in-law is 94, we managed to get her into a taxi some time ago. But the train companies ought to be arranging coaches, not taxis.' 

Sources said that the station would effectively be closed  due to delays to works north of the station

Lindesay Irvine, 45, a journalist, said he was stuck on a 'dangerously overcrowded' train after two train-loads of people, one from Bristol and one from Cornwall, were merged into one.

Mr Irvine, who was travelling to Paddington after spending Christmas with family in Bristol, said: 'They have decided to run two trains worth of people on one train. It is dangerously overcrowded.

'In health and safety terms this must be well against the law. There is not an inch of room. At the last station people tried to get on but couldn't. One person has been taken ill on the train.

'There is no room, no information and no apology. It is unacceptable. The engineering works have over-run from Christmas but they have had plenty of time to prepare.

'My Christmas in Bristol was close to perfect. And now thanks to Great Western I've been left very angry at the end of my Christmas break.'

Fellow passenger Lynda Pollard, 62, said: 'It is packed. You have got to fight your way through to the bathroom. It is so crowded you can barely move. Why have they not laid coaches on?

'The overcrowding is horrendous. There is no way of getting any food or water. It is dreadful.'

Passengers with large suitcases at Finsbury Park station this morning, where trains were moved to different platforms at short notice

Customers will need to start or finish their journey at Finsbury Park in north London, with at least one change of train, according to East Coast Trains

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin says he will be asking Network Rail what went wrong and what lessons can be learnt

Network Rail apologised for the chaos and pledged to fix the problem by tomorrow when millions of commuters return to work.

The mayhem – which affected trains to and from Scotland, the north of England, the Midlands and the West Country – started after engineers failed to lay new tracks on time at King's Cross.

Meanwhile, overrunning works west of Reading and a signalling fault at Paddington meant there was a 'very limited' service there – forcing thousands to head to London's Waterloo station to catch trains to the West.

Robin Gisby, managing director of network operations at Network Rail, said last night: 'I'm deeply sorry for the upheaval caused today. We've had an army of 11,000 engineers out over Christmas Day and Boxing Day at 2,000 locations nationwide. More than 90 per cent have been completed and handed back in time.

'Extra resources have been brought in to ensure the work is completed for the morning and we will then spend some time to better understand what went wrong.'

Bad timing: Claire Perry (pictured) claimed there was light at the end of the tunnel for passengers

Outspoken Rail Minister Claire Perry had egg on her face after boasting about rail repairs in her Christmas message.

At last there was light at the end of the tunnel for passengers, said Ms Perry in a message to her constituents in Devizes. 

Two days later the railways were plunged into chaos. 

Ms Perry's message said: '10,000 Network Rail employees will be working over the holiday period on thousands of projects, carrying the biggest upgrade of the network since Victorian times.

'Someone said politicians are people who, when they see the light at the end of the tunnel, order more tunnel. Well not any more as big rail projects come to fruition.'
