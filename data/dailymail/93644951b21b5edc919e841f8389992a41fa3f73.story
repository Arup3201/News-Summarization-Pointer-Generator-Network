Arrested: Willie Donnell Jackson, pictured, was arrested on Thursday for allegedly raping a woman that was caught on a cell phone video

An Oklahoma man was arrested on Thursday for allegedly raping a woman that was caught on a cell phone video.

Willie Donnell Jackson, 20, was arrested for first-degree rape and rape by instrumentation complaints, according to a report by TulsaWorld. He is held in lieu of $75,000 bail.

The victim reportedly went to her boyfriend's apartment last week, where she drank alcohol and smoked marijuana with both him and his roommate before passing out.

Police contacted the woman after they received a video that showed the victim 'obviously unconscious and unresponsive' while Jackson had sex with her, the site says.

The victim was 'visibly upset and shaken' when she watched the video, the site says, and told police she did not remember Jackson being at the apartment nor agree to have sex with him.

The men were also seen in the cell phone video moving the victim's body 'like a rag doll' andÂ  posing for pictures with her, according to TulsaWorld.

The victim believes that the marijuana she smoked may have been 'laced,' according to Newson6, because 'she did not remember a thing' on the cell phone video.

Police contacted the video after they received a tip about the video, which reportedly shows Jackson having sex with the 'obviously unconscious' victim
