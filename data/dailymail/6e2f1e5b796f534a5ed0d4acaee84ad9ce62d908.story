At least two people were killed and 19 injured today after an overpass built as part of Brazil's World Cup improvement works collapsed onto a busy road.

Authorities in Belo Horizonte, south-east Brazil, had rushed to get the road system ready for the start of the competition.

According to firefighters, the viaduct over the Pedro I avenue - close to the Mineirao football stadium - fell on top of a car, two trucks and a bus.

The driver of the bus has been confirmed as among the dead.

The car was completely flattened by the concrete structure and police fear more bodies could be trapped underneath the collapsed structure.

According to witnesses, workmen were removing the iron structure surrounding the concrete viaduct when the road suddenly collapsed. 

Estate agent Rogerio Alves, 37, who witnessed the accident, said: 'It was a terrifying thing. I still can't believe what I saw. I was standing nearby talking with my duaghter. Suddenly the viaduct crashed down all in one go, it happened in an instant.'  

Maria Nilza, who was about to drive underneath the viaduct at the moment it fell, told Brazil's G1 website: 'The bus shook like a fabric and fell on a bus and car right in front of me.'

Earlier this week the Mineirao football stadium played host to the round of 16 football match between Brazil and Chile. The next match is the World Cup semi-final on Tuesday.

The teams set to face each other in the competition's quarter finals who could play in the match are France or Germany against the hosts Brazil or Colombia.

Argentina, Belgium, Holland and Costa Rica make up the other teams in the tournament.

The incident was about three miles from the Minas Tennis Club where the British Olympic and Paralympic teams will have their training base ahead of the Rio 2016 Olympics. 

Heavy government spending on the World Cup and long delays in infrastructure projects spurred violent street protests across Brazil over the past year, although they have calmed down in recent weeks and the tournament has gone more smoothly than many fans and government officials expected.

Still, several projects were plagued by fatal construction accidents. Eight workers died building stadiums in the 12 cities that have hosted games.
