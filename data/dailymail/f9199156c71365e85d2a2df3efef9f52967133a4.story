A 21-year-old woman has been stabbed to death by her girlfriend after they got into a 'violent' argument while driving home in Utah, police have said.

Tawnee Maria Baird and Victoria Mendoza, 22, who lived together in Holladay, were apparently returning from visiting friends in Ogden in the early hours of the morning when they started fighting.

As the row escalated, Mendoza reportedly pulled into a parking lot, before fatally stabbing her partner of five years. She then called a relative, who rushed to the scene and dialled 911, it is said.

Officers arrived at the parking lot at 2484 East Avenue in West Ogden at around 1am, where they found both Mendoza and the victim in the vehicle. Miss Baird was pronounced dead at the scene.

'We were actually responding on a call of a murder or someone wanting to turn themselves in for a murder,' Ogden Police Lieutenant, Tim Scott, told Deseret News.

'I can tell you [Miss Baird] was stabbed to death, I can’t give you the number of stab marks or stab wounds, that will be determined by autopsy, which will likely take place tomorrow.'

He added he could also not yet say what the fight was about, but that it was a 'violent, tumultuous encounter' that did 'culminate and lead to this incident where Ms Mendoza did stab her partner'.

Following the grim discovery on Saturday, police arrested Mendoza on suspicion of murder and booked her into Weber County Jail, where she is currently being held without bail.

According to Fox 13, Mr Scott said Mendoza has been cooperative during the investigation.

Investigators are now running background checks to see if Mendoza and Miss Baird had any history of domestic violence during the five years they were in a relationship.

Yesterday, Miss Baird's father, Casey Baird, wrote on Facebook that he was flying back to Salt Lake City from Alabama after hearing that his daughter  had been killed by a woman 'all of us tried to help'.

Beloved: Yesterday, Miss Baird's (pictured) father, Casey Baird, wrote on Facebook: 'I love my lady bug more than I love myself.' He added that his daughter, a Salt Lake Community College student, was his 'best friend'

'I love my lady bug more than I love myself,' he wrote, referring to Miss Baird - who was a student at Salt Lake Community College - as his 'best friend'.

Speaking directly to Mendoza, he added angrily: 'Don't try insanity plea!!!! In fact I don't even want the death penalty!!!! I want you to sit in a prison cell and have plenty of time to rottttt!"

Mendoza will shortly appear in court charged with first-degree felony murder.
