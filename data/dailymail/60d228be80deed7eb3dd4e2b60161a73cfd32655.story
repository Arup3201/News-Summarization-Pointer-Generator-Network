The Foreign Office has warned drivers to be especially careful in Spain where motorists in British registered cars are being targeted by unscrupulous thieves

Britons heading to Spain  on holiday have been warned to watch out for highway robbers targeting some of the most popular tourist routes.

Organised gangs are singling out foreign drivers heading for the coast and creating a distraction to steal passports, cash and computers.

As the summer holiday season gets under way, the Foreign Office has warned of a surge in the thefts.

It says most of the 612 emergency travel documents issued by British consulates in Spain this year followed motorway attacks and has released a video showing footage of robberies and some of the tactics used.

Gangs often flag victims down, indicating there is a problem with their car.

While one robber gets out to distract the tourists, their unseen accomplice steals documents, money and valuables from the car before making a swift getaway.

While there have been isolated incidents in the past, officials say gangs are now operating routinely along the coast between Barcelona and Alicante, across Andalucia in the south and in the Madrid region.

Spanish police have had to deal with 126 British victims of distraction thefts on one motorway – the busy AP7 from the French border to Valencia – in the past two years.

Another main highway where cars with GB number plates or rental stickers are being targeted is on roads from the northern ferry port of Santander to Madrid and further south to Spain’s popular beaches.

Pensioner Roy Moore, 69, and his wife Helen had the rear tyre of their Peugeot slashed with a knife when they stopped at a service station near Logrono en route to the Costa Calida in Murcia province.

The thieves took their passports, €300 , bank and credit cards, a laptop, driving licence, their dog’s pet passport and the keys to their home in Salisbury, Wiltshire.

Mrs Moore, a retired care home worker, said: ‘It all happened so fast. We were left in shock, penniless at the roadside and stranded in Spain along with our dog Merlyn.

‘The police and the British vice consul in Alicante were very helpful. We can get temporary one-day travel documents issued except for Merlyn, who is technically stuck in Spain until we can arrange veterinary clearance for him to eventually return to England.’

Thieves have attacked 126 British motorists using the AP7 from the French border to Valencia over the past two years using distraction threats, stealing cash, passports and electronic goods

Richard Hibbs, from Llandudno in North Wales, and his brother-in-law, who lives in Spain, were robbed of their passports and other documents after a gang stopped their car near a toll booth on the AP7 north of Barcelona.

He said: ‘Anyone travelling with UK plates should think at least twice before stopping on a Spanish motorway, particularly at night, and don’t keep your valuables in the same place. If you do have to stop, don’t all get out of the car.’

Will Middleton, the consular regional director for Spain, said: ‘Distraction is the most common technique used by the highway robbers.

‘They will try to worry you about the state of your vehicle, and then whilst they point out the supposed problem, an accomplice is robbing you.

‘So be wary of anyone attempting to stop when you are driving, or trying to point out a problem or offering assistance. They may not be the Good Samaritan they appear to be.’
