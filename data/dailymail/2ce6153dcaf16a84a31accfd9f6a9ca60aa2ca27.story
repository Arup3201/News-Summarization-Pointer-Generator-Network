The British Museum has once again topped the pile when it comes to the UK's most popular tourist attractions.

Based on data collected by Visit England, this handy infographic shows the top 50 places to visit; whether it's stunning countryside, historic sites or man-made attractions.

And the list is far from dominated by locations in London; featured among other is the Eden Project in Cornwall, Flamingo Land in Yorkshire, and of course Stonehenge. 

The British Museum recorded just over 6.7 million visitors in 2013, and with just over 6 million visits, it was fellow London attraction the National Gallery that was the second most popular.

In fact nine of the top ten sites were in the capital. Brighton Pier in sixth spot with 4 million visitors was the sole entry from outside London.

Scott Fairhurst, director of Perfect Stays, who designed the infographic, told MailOnline Travel: 'It comes as no surprise that London's great museums and galleries are so popular with visitors. 

'However, it's great to see other regional institutions - Manchester's Museum of Science and Industry and Cornwall's world-famous Eden Project to name a few - also making the list. 

'These attractions are a testament to the cultural, technological, and archaeological achievements of our great nation, and I look forward to seeing a healthy summer of tourism in 2015.'
