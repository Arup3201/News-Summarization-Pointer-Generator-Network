Many footballers manage to keep just a fraction of the keepsakes from their medal-laden careers. But Bayern Munich star Arjen Robben has come up with a novel idea to ensure nothing important gets forgotten.

The former Real Madrid, Chelsea and PSV Eindhoven star has announced he plans to build a museum to house all his memorabilia in his own home once he calls time on an illustrious career.

'When my wife and I are settled in our house, I dream of collecting all my things and building a private museum. It will be for me, my family and my close friends,' the Dutch international told Bild.

The Dutchman is determined to ensure than 'nothing is lost' from his time at some of Europe's top clubs

Robben won a La Liga title and the Spanish Super Cup during his time at the mighty Real Madrid

'I have so many souvenirs - shirts of other players. I kept the ball from the 2013 Champions League final (Bayern beat Borussia Dortmund 2-1 and Robben scored a late winner).

'There are boots that I have worn at European Championships and World Cups. The idea is to pull everything together so that nothing is lost.'
