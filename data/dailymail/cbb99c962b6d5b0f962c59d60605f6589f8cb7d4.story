A two-year-old boy from Georgia is fighting for his life after a gust of wind from Superstorm Sandy snapped a large tree limb that fell on him Monday.

Tripp Halstead, a sunny toddler with spiked blonde hair, was playing behind his Winder day care center when the 10-foot tree branch struck him in the head.

The child sustained a brain injury and has been in a medically induced coma at the Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston after undergoing emergency surgery.

Tripp’s favorite toy, Lightning McQueen, is in his hand as he remains unconscious.

A family friend set up a Facebook for Tripp's parents, Bill and Stacy Halstead, who have been posting updates on their son's condition and asking people to pray and donate money for his recovery.

The family have said that they have been overwhelmed with support from thousands of well-wishers, many of them strangers who have heard about Tripp’s plight from media reports, according to Atlanta Journal Constitution.

By Friday afternoon, the Tripp Halstead Updates page has attracted more than 15,700 fans.

On Thursday, the toddler's father, Bill Halstead, wrote that doctors gave them sobering news.

'His injury is across both sides of the brain which makes it much worse. It is still far too early to know what the outcome will be or what the lasting damage could be,' the message read.

This morning, the family posted another update with more bad news. 

'His swelling is back up and his drainage tube is having problems,' the post said in part. 'Sounds like today is going to be the most trying day so far so please continue to pray. We still need a miracle.'

The boy's mother, Stacy Halstead, called her son a miracle baby, explaining to WSB-TV that she and her husband had struggled for a long time to conceive until finally she became pregnant with Tripp, their one and only child.

On Monday, tragedy struck when the toddler was playing at around 11.30am outside the Cribs and Crayons day care center, CBS Atlanta reported. 

A strong gust of wind caused a tree limb to fall, hitting the little boy in the neck and head. Employees from the center rushed to his aid and administered CPR, but the damage has been done.

Since the accident, the boy's family have been on a roller coaster ride, going from positive signs, like a brief reduction in pressure around his brain, to serious complications, among them problems with his breathing. 

On Friday afternoon, a desperate plea appeared on the family's Faceboook page asking for prayers. 

'Please Please Please Pray for a miracle and if we can't have a miracle pray for the family to have the strength to cope with what lays ahead.'
