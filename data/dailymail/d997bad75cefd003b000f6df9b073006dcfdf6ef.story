Brazilian Willian has revealed how he feels he must 'kill a lion' every time he puts on a Chelsea shirt.

The 26-year-old has started the last two Premier League games as well as the Champions League tie against Schalke after recovering from his World Cup exertions

And Willian, signed from Anzhi Makhachkala for £32million in 2013, admitted he was under pressure to keep his place.

Brazilian Willian has started the last four games for Chelsea at home and in Europe

He said: 'I have to prove myself on a daily basis at Chelsea. I have to kill a lion each time and I am dedicated to that. This is an expression from Brazil.

'When I started to play, my Dad would use this punch-line all the time to instill confidence in me and make me work hard if I wanted results to occur.'

Willian said Jose Mourinho had helped him regain his Brazil place

Willian paid tribute to Chelsea manager Jose Mourino for helping him regain his place in the national squad.

He added: 'Working with Jose is a learning experience on a daily basis. He demands much but he is very specific and very precise in the requests he makes.

'I am learning much. It has improved my game and helped me get into the national team.'

Willian was all smiles as he prepared for Champions League clash against Sporting Lisbon

Chelsea face Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League on Tuesday.

Willian said: 'It is a difficult match against a great club with quality players. We are prepared. We respect them, but we are here to collect points. We come here to win. We cannot afford to slip.'
