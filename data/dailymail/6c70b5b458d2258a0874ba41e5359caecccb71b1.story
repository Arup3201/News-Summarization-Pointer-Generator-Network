Buttercup is a duck who is now able to waddle freely like any other - thanks to a 3D-printed left foot.

Buttercup was hatched at an Arlington, Tennessee, high school with his left foot turned backwards .

It meant he was unable to walk or swim properly. It also caused him a lot of pain.

The school contacted the Feathered Angels sanctuary, where founder Mike Garey saw the deformity and decided to do something about it.

Quack happy: Buttercup the duck shows off his new (red) 3-D printed webbed foot

I beleive I can walk: Buttercup was born with a twisted left goof, but thanks to 3D printing technology, a prosthetic has been developed for him to enable him to walk and swim properly

Painful: Butterfly was born with one backward-facing foot, but a 3D printer has made her a mould for a new foot

Mr Garey Contacted NovaCopy who specialise in 3D printing.

Because the foot needs to be flexible, the usual plastics used in 3D printing would not be viable.

So instead, the company scanned the left foot of Buttercup's sister Minnie and printed a 3D mould which was then used to cast a silicone foot 
for the lucky duck.

The
 new bright orange prosthetic foot and nylon sock that Buttercup wears 
isn't quite as flexible the real thing but it does mean that Buttercup 
can now walk and swim in way he never has been able to before.

Printing the replacement foot took just over 13 hours.

The future is now: The 3D design and molding process for Buttercup the duck's new foot

Webby to wear: Thanks to cutting-edge 3D printing technology, the little duck now has a brand new webbed prosthesis

'It's
 different for him because his leg is taller than it used to be when he 
just had the peg,' Garey told USA Today. 'His muscles will have to 
adjust, but I'm amazed at how well he's doing right off the bat.'

Mr
 Garey is already discussing what the next steps will be in Buttercup’s 
prosthetic work. A new scanner will allow engineers to scan the current 
 prosthetic, then edit its design in a computer program.

He still is amazed at how well the original prosthetic has worked for Buttercup.

Does this meet your approval sir? Buttercup the duck is shown his new 3D printed foot for the first time

'There
 was always the big unknown of whether or not it would work and if he 
would accept it. If he didn’t like the prosthetic and wouldn’t walk on 
it, it  wouldn’t have mattered how many times I changed it.'

Joel
 Graves, the 3-D engineer who printed the prototype for Buttercup’s 
foot, said he also was amazed that the first trial of the prosthetic 
worked.

Mr Graves often 
works on manufacturing projects, and even some medical projects. He said
 3-D printing sometimes gets a bad reputation because of the media’s 
focus on the printing of weapons.

'That isn’t the point,' he says. 'The point is to help people - or even animals - improve their quality of life.'

'It’s
 extraordinary to work on something that will actually benefit someone, 
even if that someone is a duck,' Graves said. 'It could be a person 
benefiting like this in the future.'

Wobble instead of a waddle: As Buttercup grew bigger her trouble with her deformed foot became more apparent

3D for free: With the help of NovaCopy, a 3D modelling company that donated its services, a new mould was made for a silicone foot for Buttercup

Advances in the development of 3D printers have been revolutionizing the way objects can be created.

Recently, US scientists printed tiny batteries as small as a grain of sand, from interlocked stacks of miniscule electrodes.

Brides in Japan are even paying to have themselves printed in 3D on their special day so they can be immortalised on their wedding day.

Quackers about it: Buttercup will now be able to walk and swim properly at the Waterfowl sanctuary in Tennessee

Clothing, shoes and other fashion accessories have been printed using machines around the world.

In
 the medical field, the fascinating machines have been used to print 
life-saving medical devices, changing the way health experts approach 
thinking about diagnostics and devices and prosthetic limbs.  

Doctors have saved the 
life of a toddler whose airway had collapsed by printing him an airway 
splint, in just one day.

However, 3D printers have also raised a serious ethical debate about the limits 
of what can be produced, after bullets and gun parts were printed in the
 US.

He was born with a backward left foot

It was amputated in February because he could not walk well on it

Using a 3D printer, a mould was been made of his foot and now a silicone one has been attached
