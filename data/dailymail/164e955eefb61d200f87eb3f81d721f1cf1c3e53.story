Their hair neatly brushed or snipped carefully into delicate spheres, the stars of photographer Paul Nathan's new book couldn't be more elegant if they tried.

But these are no ordinary models. Instead, they are Poodles, Cockerspaniels, Bichon Frisés, Bedlington Terriers and Komondors - each one groomed to within an inch of its life.

'To achieve the perfect canine haircut, beauty must coexist with and be dictated by harmony,' writes expert Jorge Bendersky in the foreword to Groomed.

'The art of dog grooming is not only about highlighting the anatomical points that bring balance to the animal, it’s also about the deep connection between dog and groomer.

'For a successful outcome dogs must trust, cooperate with, and essentially bond with their groomer.'

His collection of elegantly coiffed canines were photographed backstage at a grooming show, moments before they took to the stage.

Groomed is not the first time Nathan has turned photographing a glamorous posse of pooches into an art form.

His last book, Couture Dogs of New York, featured the pampered pets of wealthy New Yorkers for whom a $600 designer outfit and lavish 'barkmitzvahs' are a regular part of life.

While the animals featured in his latest work don't have the same impressive wardrobes, some are given extreme makeovers, among them Francesca, the Standard Poodle, who has a palm tree and a parrot decorating her derriere.

Others such as Sapphire, another Standard Poodle, have to make do with some prettily tied ribbons, while more still are left to rely on their shiny fur to impress the judges.

'My task as a dog groomer is to capture and enhance that particular animal’s singularity with a distinguished and fashionably tasteful grooming style,' adds Bendersky.

'It should bring out the best attributes of not only that particular breed, but also that individual dog.'

Groomed by Paul Nathan and Jorge Bendersky, £22.50, is published by Pelluceo and is available from Amazon
