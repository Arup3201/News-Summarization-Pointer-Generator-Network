For tourist Bruce Pasarow of Buena Park, California, leaving Illinois before seeing what's billed as the 'World's Largest Bottle of Catsup' was not an option.

The Collinsville water tower is a depiction of Brooks Old Original Rich and Tangy Catsup, which was once produced in the buildings beneath the tower.

Now, the sign is for sale. Owner Larry Eckert is asking $500,000 for the 65-year-old, 170-foot-tall landmark and adjacent warehouse.

For sale: A water tower shaped like a 170-foot-tall ketchup bottle is for sale in southern Illinois, along with an adjacent warehouse. Fans fear the 65-year-old landmark, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, might be in peril if a sympathetic buyer isn't found

The landmark replicates a bottle of Brooks Old Original Rich and Tangy Catsup, which was produced in the buildings beneath the tower.

The 100,000-gallon tower held water — never ketchup — and it hasn't been used since Brooks moved out in the early 1960s.

The plant later became a warehouse used for shipping and trucking operations of Bethel-Eckert, which for four decades serviced military commissaries before losing its contracts.

Larry Eckert, the owner, initially considered selling the ketchup bottle and warehouse separately, then decided one can't go without the other.

'Whoever would be interested, you'd need the additional land anyway,' he said.

Eckert said because the ketchup bottle is on the National Register of Historic Places, he expects the eventual buyer to preserve it.

The 100,000-gallon tower never held ketchup. It hasn't been used since Brooks moved out in the 1960s.

Judy Demoisy helped save the bottle when it was in danger of being torn down in 1993.

She says preservationists believe using it in a ketchup museum would be great.

'It's a global condiment,' she says.

Originally, the tower was used to supply water for catsup production and to run the plant's fire sprinkler system, but in the early 1960s, the Collinsville plant was closed and operations moved to Indiana.

The plant was turned into a warehouse. But the bottle-shaped water tower remained.

The tower fell into disrepair over the years before eventually being restored in 1995, thanks to a grassroots funding effort.

At about that time the owners offered to donate the tower to the city of Collinsville. But city leaders at the time declined to take the gift.

'The administration at that time didn't get it,' Gassmann said. 'They didn't want anything to do with it, so the offer was declined.'
