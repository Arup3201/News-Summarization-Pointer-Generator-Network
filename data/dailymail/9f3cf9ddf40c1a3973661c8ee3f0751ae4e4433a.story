Britain enjoyed the hottest temperatures so far this month today – officially the first day of summer - before three weeks’ worth of rain fall overnight and damp weather ruins the rest of the week.

The mercury soared to 22.5C (72.5F) in Northholt, west London this afternoon – topping this month’s previous high of 21.9C (71.4F). Other hotspots included Pershore in Worcestershire, which warmed to 22.1C (71.8C) and Cardiff, where it hit 21.6C (71.1F).

But up to 1.6in of rain is expected to fall overnight and weather alerts have been issued in the South West and South Wales.

‘'It's going to be a very unsettled night with torrential rain moving across the south  and central parts of the country and further showers expected later in the night,' said Met Office forecaster Emma Sharples.

'Between 20 and 40mm could fall in some places - with the worst affected areas being South West England and South Wales. The other thing to bare in mind is that it will be falling quite quickly, which could potentially cause problems with surface run-off water.'

And conditions are not expected to improve much for the remainder of the summer.

‘July begins unsettled with low pressure
close to the UK, June's 'headache' of rather unsettled and cool weather
extending into the new month,’ said WeatherOnline meteorologist Simon 
Keeling.

‘Period of rain and quite brisk winds 
at times only slowly moving away, a regime of heavy showers and sunny 
spells left in its wake.

‘Through the latter stages of 'High 
Summer' it looks as if low pressure dives into the UK from the west or 
northwest bringing a return of rather unsettled weather with heavy rain 
to all areas.

‘August 
doesn’t look brilliant at all. It may be an umbrella month rather than a
bucket-and-spade month, with low pressure taking control of summer.’

It means a host of big events over the summer are likely to be plagued by rain.

The soggy conditions threaten to turn tomorrow’s Ladies’ Day event at Royal Ascot into a mud bath.

Forecasters warned of downpours overshadowing Silverstone’s Formula 1 Grand Prix on June 8, The Open golf championship between July 19 and July 22 and the Olympics from July 27 to August 12.

Music festivals, including V Festival, Reading and Leeds, are also likely to be soggy events.

Meanwhile in continental Europe, Rome sweltered in record 37C heat and Vienna baked as temperatures hit 34.

The current forecast in Britain is also in stark contrast to a year ago when, during the Glastonbury Festival, the mercury soared to 33C (91.4F).

The
music event was called off this year due to the Olympics. Today the 
Sommerset site was empty apart from the main stage in the middle of a 
field overlooking Glastonbury Tor.

The
damp weather verdict will worry tourism bosses after rain cost tens of 
millions of pounds in lost income this month as holidaymakers stayed 
home.

Seafront guest house owners have already complained that ‘staycation’ holidaymakers are being put off by the forecasts.

Claire
Jeavons, who runs the Beverley Park holiday site in Paignton, Devon, 
said: ‘We've been receiving many calls from worried customers, but we 
assure them that flooding at our altitude would also mean the entire 
English Riviera was hundreds of feet underwater.’

Tony
Clish, director of Park Holidays UK, believes that weather reports are 
exaggerating flood risks and causing some tourists to stay at home.

The company owns Felixstowe Beach Holiday Park and Suffolk Sands Holiday Park, which together have more than 700 caravans.

‘Just
last week we were told that all caravan parks in southern England were 
on flood alert, and this simply wasn't the case’ said Mr Clish.

‘Some parks in Wales did flood 
recently, but that's no reason to suggest that caravans in Suffolk would
soon be bobbing around on parks which have never flooded before.’

In the Channel Islands, the cost to hotels, shops and traders has been laid bare.

Already
battling against the recession, they are seeing their profits wiped out
just at a time when the holiday season should be gearing up to its 
peak.

Guernsey's tourist 
bosses say the island has missed out on up to 7,000 wealthy visitors 
already this year, due to cruise ships cancelling visits.

However,
one blessing that has come from the topsy-turvy weather is that it 
appears to have helped create a bumper crop of buttercups.

Student Maddi Ridley, 18, from Southampton, was pictured enjoying the yellow flowers as she relaxed in a field near Burley in the New Forest this morning.

But the large numbers of the crops are causing problems for horses.

The
RSPCA has issued a warning to horse owners to beware of 'buttercup 
burn' after seeing an increase in callouts to animals with sore noses 
and mouths.

The rashes are caused by the ranunculin present in the flowers.

Warnings: Heavy rain is expected to fall across southern England and wales -risking floods - between midnight and 12pm tomorrow

Torrential rain will sweep in overnight with heavy downpours hitting the West at 1am tomorrow (left). By 7am, the band of rain will have spread towards London. The pink areas show where it will fall heaviest (up to 32mm a minute), followed by red (16mm), orange (8mm), yellow (4mm), green (2mm), light blue (1mm) and dark blue (0.5mm)
