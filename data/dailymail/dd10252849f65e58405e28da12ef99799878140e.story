Aldi brand: The £9.65 Oliver Cromwell London Dry Gin which was praised by testers

A bottle of £10 gin from Aldi beat some of the world's most highly-regarded spirits which cost up to five times as much in a blind taste test.

Experts ranked the cut-price supermarket's gin alongside more established rivals and a bottle from from Harrods.

The budget Aldi  £9.65 Oliver Cromwell London Dry Gin has sold in the supermarket since 1999.

It comes in 70cl bottles and is described as having a 'ripe, citrus aroma with rounded spice and a touch of juniper'.

It is the only Aldi own label gin and is distilled for a 'clear, crisp, complex flavour'.

Adjudicators at the International Spirits Challenge awarded it a silver medal, the same as The London No.1 Gin, which sells for £35 at Harrods.

The Worship Street Whistling Shop Cream Gin, which costs £55.95, also won silver.

But mainstream brands such as Bombay Sapphire, selling for £21.70, and Hendricks, at  £26.39, only won bronze.

A panel of six judges which is made up of selected master distillers, blenders, specialist writers and prominent industry figures carried out blind taste tests on 70 different gins over the course of a day.

The ISC is founded on a rigorous and objective blind tasting process, by panels of selected master distillers, blenders, specialist writers and prominent industry figures – all acknowledged experts in their field.

Aldi was highly commended in the standard category which contains lower end supermarket bottles.

Tony Baines, from Aldi, said: 'Our expert buyer works closely with some of the world's leading distilleries so we can deliver high quality Own Label spirits to our customers.

'It is fantastic that our commitment to quality has been recognised by such a prestigious group as the ISC tasting panel.

'It's
safe to say we're all in high spirits today - and we hope our customers
will enjoy raising a glass of Gin and Tonic to our success.'

Several other products in Aldi’s 
spirits range were also highly decorated, with two of its vodkas also 
picking up Silver awards, whilst its amaretto, white rum and peach 
schnapps each scooped Bronze awards in the ‘liqueurs’ category.

The Aldi gin has previously won a 
silver medal in the International Wine and Spirit Competition last year 
and was named as the best in its class.

Gin
sales in the UK grew by 12 per cent in pubs, bars, and restaurants last
year, and by 5 per cent in off-licences and supermarkets.

In total, more than 1,000 spirits 
from 70 different countries are entered into the International Spirits 
Challenge competition each year.
