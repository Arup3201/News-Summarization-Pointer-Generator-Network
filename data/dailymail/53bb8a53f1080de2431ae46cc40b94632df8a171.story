Victim: Shammi Atwal, 45, died after being shoved into the road by a group of armed robbers and was hit by an HGV (right) after they raided his cash and carry, the Old Bailey has heard

A wealthy businessman was crushed to death when a gang of armed robbers pushed him under a lorry as they fled his cash-and-carry, the Old Bailey has heard.

Shammi Atwal, 45, confronted the six men after they assaulted his wife, Damanjeet Kaur, in Barking, east London, a jury was told.

The father-of-two from Chigwell, Essex, was shoved into the road after he struggled with the group and died from catastrophic injuries when the HGV hit him just yards away from the sucessful business he owned.

The raiders got away with just £1,000 after allegedly stormed the warehouse, ran by Mr Atwal's company Glenn & Co, with sledgehammers and metal bars on October 14 last year.

They attacked the premises and those who worked there 'intent on taking whatever cash was to hand', David Howker QC told the court.

Devidas Sumskas, 25, Farhan Ahmed Sheikh, 39,  Edgaras Balezantis, 25, Vidmantas Gorskoves, 26, Aurimas Diliunas, 27, and Reiniks Kivers, 30, deny manslaughter and conspiracy to rob.

Mr Howker, for the prosecution, told the jury: 'Armed robbery is a serious and violent crime and those who take part in such an enterprise, as you appreciate, are obviously prepared to threaten and use violence to achieve their aim, which is to steal cash and get away without being caught.

'In this case that readiness to use whatever force was necessary resulted in a high price being paid because, as they made their escape, some of the workers in the cash-and-carry gave chase.

Investigation: Forensic officers examine the scene following the horrific incident in October last year. The court heard the six men got away with just £1,000

Weapon: An officer from the Met Police holds what appears to be a bat sealed in a plastic container

'In particular, Damanjeet Kaur’s 
husband - one of the owners of the business, Mr Shammi Atwal - gave 
chase and confronted one of the robbers on the street outside the 
premises.

'Mr Atwal paid 
with his life because that robber, in order to escape and get away, 
pushed Mr Atwal away and into the path of a lorry. He went under the 
wheels of that lorry and was crushed to death.

'Each of these men, we say, was party to the plot to rob Mr Atwal’s business and each of them, we say, bears criminal responsibility for this death.'

The court heard that the gang travelled to the Glenn and Co cash-and-carry in a black BMW 5-series car, with some dressed in dark clothing and wearing gloves.

They attacked the premises and those who worked there 'intent on taking whatever cash was to hand', Mr Howker said.

Search: Officers look for evidence left by the alleged gang members who fled the scene after the suspected robbery

Wealthy: Mr Atwal's business, Glenn & Co was successful, bringing in between £5,000 and £10,000 a day. Police officers searched the premises in the aftermath of the alleged robbery

Mr Atwal and his friend Avtar Mann run the business, which sells beer, wines and spirits to pubs and wine bars.

The two men knew each other from India and operated the cash-and-carry on River Road from about 2005.

Ms Kaur worked there part-time, spending a few hours there each day while her children were at school, the court heard.

The business was taking around £5,000 to £10,000 a day and more at weekends, mainly in cash.

On the day of the robbery, the takings for the weekend were due to be banked, the court heard.

'It may not be a coincidence that the robbers chose a Monday to hit the business,' Mr Howker said.

All the defendants are Lithuanian except Sheikh, who is alleged to be a close associate of Sumskas, the court heard.

The trial continues.
