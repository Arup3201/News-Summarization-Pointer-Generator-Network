A leading Labour MP has claimed that 2,000 Britons have travelled to Iraq and Syria to fight for ISIS and other jihadist organisations. 

Khalid Mahmood, MP for the Birmingham Perry Barr constituency, claimed that official figures on the numbers of British jihadis is grossly underestimating the size of the problem. 

UK security officials believe in the region of 500 men have travelled to Iraq and Syria, but Mr Mahmood claims this figure is widely inaccurate.

Labour MP Khalid Mahmood believes British jihadists are being able to enter the country due to lax security

Abu Abdullah al-Habashi, left, and Abu Dharda, right, are believed to have been killed in Kobane, Syria 

He said: 'The authorities say there are 500 British jihadists but the likely figure is at least three to four times that. I think 2,000 is a better estimate. My experience in Birmingham is it is a huge, huge problem.' 

Mr Mahmood told the Sunday Telegraph: 'The Government does not have significant people at border control. The fact is these jihadists are coming in and going out without almost ever being arrested. We have had hardly any arrests. We have had people coming back in after six months in Syria and they are not being picked up.'

Mr Mahmood's warning follows reports that British jihadis Abu Dharda, 20 and Abu Abdullah al Habashi, 21. 

The two men from London are believed to have been killed in heavy fighting in the Syrian border town of Kobane, which has been the subject of a major counter-offensive by Kurdish fighters, supported by US Air Force bombers.  

Al-Habashi grew up in north London in a British-Eritrean family and converted to Islam at the age of 16. 

The US Air Force has been using the fearsome B1-b bomber to attack ISIS targets in Kobane, Syria 

He told the BBC back in August that he was one of the few British jihadists who fought with ISIS in Syria and Iraq. 

During the interview, he admitted that he was never going to return to Britain despite the pleas of his family. 

Dhardra grew up in west London and is from a British-Somali background. He entered Syria in December 2013 after crossing the Turkish border. 

Almost 30 Britons are believed to have been killed fighting for jihadist organisations although the Foreign Office confirmed that determining exact figures is incredibly difficult. 

A spokesman said: 'We are aware of reports of the death of two British nationals in Syria.

'The UK has advised for some time against all travel to Syria, where all UK consular services are suspended.

'As we do not have any representation in Syria, it is extremely difficult to get any confirmation of deaths or injuries and our options for supporting British nationals there are extremely limited.'
