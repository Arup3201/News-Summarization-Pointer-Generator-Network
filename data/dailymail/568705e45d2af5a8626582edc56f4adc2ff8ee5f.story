Paris St Germain are the latest club to show an interest in taking Adnan Januzaj on loan from Manchester United.

The French champions had a bid rejected for the young Belgium international last year and are keen to see if he will join on a temporary deal.

Januzaj needs games to continue his development and United still see him as part of their long-term planning.

The 19-year-old, who is also eligible to play in European competition, has interest from English clubs such as Everton and Hull while Inter Milan are also keen. 

His last appearance for United was on December 2 against Stoke City at Old Trafford.

Januzaj has yet to score in any competition this year and is keen to get more time on the pitch. 

United have plans for Januzaj but the starlet has struggled to get as much game time as he would like lately
