Since she first made her name more than a decade ago. Alexa Chung has had many vocations, including model, TV presenter, WAG, IT girl, author, and now, fashion designer. 

The 31-year-old Brit, who now resides in New York, revealed her debut range with premium denim brand AG Jeans at an action-packed launch in Selfridges this evening. 

As well as showcasing the 20-strong collection at the London department store, Alexa also dabbled in a bit of basketball with the legions of fans who had turned out to see their style icon.

Alexa appeared delighted to be showing off the fruits of her labour, which included a variety of casual and relaxed pieces, from overalls and T-shirts to pinafore dresses and high-waisted jeans.

The range, which is almost entirely made of denim has been designed in the star's signature laid-back style. 

A grey sweater, which is one of the only items not to be made from a blue fabric features the words: 'J'ai du vague à l'âme,' which loosely translated means, 'I have melancholy.' 

The slogan was a nod to Alexa's obsession with Parisian chic and the relationship between Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin.

Earlier this month, the model debuted a short film which she made in collaboration with director Gia Coppola and online retailer MyTheresa.com in order to promote her collection. 

The video, which was shot at Coppola's home in the Hollywood Hills, was created exclusively for MyTheresa.com as part of their new Tunes campaign and sees Alexa showcasing her impressive karaoke skills.

Appropriately, the leggy brunette is seen singing her own version of Stevie Nicks' 1994 hit Blue Denim in the clip, which is focused around an LA party at which Alexa is a guest. 

Alexa first revealed that she was working with AG on a collection back in June, telling WWD.com: 'The collection is inherently the missing pieces of my dream denim wardrobe, which, as ever, is predominantly inspired by a late Sixties, early Seventies aesthetic.

Wardrobe essentials: Alexa's AG collection includes a number of casual and relaxed pieces, from shorts to mini skirts

Sweater style: The collection draws on Alexa's own unique fashion sense, which has seen her hailed as one of the world's most stylish women 

The former TV presenter also revealed that she had paid a trip to the AG factory, in order to get a real taste for how the company operated - and to learn how exactly her pieces would be made, from start to finish. 

'I found the trip incredibly inspiring and an opportunity to learn about denim and make things I had been dreaming about finding,' she added. 

While the exact prices of each piece are not yet available, AG has confirmed that the collection, which will officially launch on January 15, will be priced between $70 and $300.

It is not the first time that Alexa has put her design skills to the test. 

In 2010, the socialite announced a collaboration with popular main street store Madewell, revealing at the time that, while she was responsible for sketching the inspiration for each piece in the collection, it was the company's brand directors who helped her to bring them all to life. 

Retro-inspired: Each of the pieces, which will be priced between $70 and $300, has a laid-back, casual feel 

Blue denim: In order to promote the collection, Alexa also released a short film, directed by Gia Coppola, in which she sings a rendition of Stevie Nicks' 1994 classic jean-inspired hit

Casual comfort: As well as the main denim collection, the range also includes T-shirts and sweaters

'I can't take credit for the hard work at all because I just took sketches in and talked about them,' she told Glamour. 

'Kin [Madewell's design director] was magical and made it all exist. It was good fun from my end. . . maybe not from hers. 

'I drew really slightly rubbish drawings and then said, "but can it have dots on it?"

'It's actually a bit weird to see everyone walking around in the clothes today because they all look like me.'

'It's a very egotistical exercise.'
