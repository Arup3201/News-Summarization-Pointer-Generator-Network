Small victories: Pickles has managed to overturn the European Commission diktat that the flag must be flown for a week in May

Eric Pickles is to snub his nose at Brussels by announcing plans to celebrate Europe Day by flying the EU flag as far away from public view as possible - in a cellar.

The Communities Secretary has successfully overturned a European Commission diktat that the 12-star banner must be flown outside the buildings of all government ministries for one week from 9 May.

The commission has rewritten its rules to state that the flag must still be displayed - but only somewhere on the premises; not necessarily outside.

Mr Pickles has cheekily responded by pledging to unfurl the blue and yellow standard in a spare room in the basement of his Department of Communities and Local Government.

And instead of being flown in the normal sense, the EU flag will simply be pinned on a notice board - in a sign of what the Communities minister really thinks of Brussels.

The basement room was previously used as a subsidised bar for civil servants called the DETR Darts Bar, opened by his predecessor John Prescott in the late 1990s.

Mr Pickles closed the bar as part of cost-cutting measures to bring down the deficit - and it now stands completely empty. There is no need for anyone to visit it.

Last night a source at the DCLG said: ‘We have a spare room in the basement of the building thanks to the closure of the “Prezza Arms”, so there is plenty of space for the flag down there.

‘The only Union flag that should be flying is the United Kingdom’s union flag.’

The old EU rules, agreed by Labour in 2006, stated that government departments had to fly the EU flag in front of its premises for one week every year, after Europe Day, on 9 May.

Visible failure to comply could have resulted in the European Commission imposing fines.

Following pressure from Mr Pickles, the UK Government has fought to renegotiate this requirement. And, on 21 December last year, new watered-down rules came forward.

The new rules merely state that departments must ‘display the EU emblem at the premises of each managing authority’. There is requirement to fly the flag outside, and the revised requirements could be met by an internal noticeboard somewhere inside the building.

The victory was revealed in the Commons yesterday by Mr Pickles, who said the ‘petty’ European Union regulation agreed by the last Labour administration had now gone following talks led by his department.

He told MPs this was an example of how the UK could and should claim powers back from Brussels.

He said: ‘I would like to make a brief statement about the European Union. The last Labour Government signed up to petty EU laws that forced my and other departments to fly the European Union flag outside our buildings.

‘I can announce today that we have renegotiated this law. Moving forward, this burdensome law to fly the EU flag has gone. This small step shows our nation can and should claim powers back from unelected bureaucrats in Brussels.’

Addressing Speaker John Bercow, Mr Pickles added to laughter from MPs: ‘Could I apologise to you for not flying the flag of Buckingham yesterday to celebrate your birthday. I hope you had a good day.’

Mr Bercow, MP for Buckingham, replied: ‘You are forgiven.’
