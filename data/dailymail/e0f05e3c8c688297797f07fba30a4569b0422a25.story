A woman has been charged with child neglect after an incident at a Florida bar over the weekend.

Ashton Krauss, 28, of Ocean Ridge, reportedly showed up at the Banana Boat Lounge and Restaurant Sunday evening at around 5:30pm, put her child in a high chair and then went off to get a drink and dance.

After complaints about the child's crying, Krauss picked the baby up and then fell over while twirling the baby.

Mommy and me: Krauss (above) reportedly left her crying baby alone in a high chair to go dance, drink and order food with friends

According to the Sun-Sentinel; 'Customers and staff rushed in to try and help the woman and child but that caused Krauss to get angry.' 

This after Krauss, a local hairdresser, had left the child to order food and drink and socialize with other patrons.

The child fell on top of Krauss in the fall and suffered no injuries. 

Police soon arrived on the scene saying that Krauss was 'violent and belligerent,' and they later found an open beer in the console of her vehicle and another alcoholic beverage unopened in her purse. 

Bad spill: After people complained about the crying baby, Krauss began twirling the child and the two fell over

The opened beverage was a 16 oz. can of Michelob Ultra and the unopened one was a 16 oz.-can of Angry Orchard cider beer. 

She was booked into the Palm Beach County Jail on charges of child neglect and disorderly conduct, and is being held on $3,000 bail.

Her uncle currently has custody of the child.
