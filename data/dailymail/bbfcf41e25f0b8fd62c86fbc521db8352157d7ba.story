A former volunteer firefighter and his girlfriend charged in a string of arsons on the Eastern Shore has pleaded guilty to 68 counts.

40-year-old Charles Smith III pleaded guilty on Thursday in Accomack County Circuit Court to 67 counts of arson and one count of conspiracy to commit arson. He will be sentenced in December.

Smith and his fiancée, Tonya Bundick, were accused of setting fire to abandoned structures between November 2012 and April of this year. They were arrested April 2.

The string of intentionally set night-time blazes continued unabated for 142 days despite an influx of police investigators from around the state.

Devastation: This March 5 blaze was one of the 77 arsons that occurred in the rural Eastern Shore of Virginia from November to April

Bundick is charged with one count of arson and one count of conspiracy.

In court documents, Smith told investigators he torched 52 unoccupied buildings, while Bundick set fire to 15

Investigators have not been able to uncover why Smith 
III, who went by the alias Charles Applegate when he served as captain 
of the Tasley Volunteer Fire Department several years ago, and his 
girlfriend, Tonya S. Bundick, decided to start the blazes.

On Thursday, Smith's attorney made note of his client's bi-polar disorder, which was diagnosed after his arrest.

Carl Bundick said this is the first time in his life that his client is being properly treated for the condition, reports WBOC.

He also reportedly said Smith is 'extremely remorseful' for his actions.

He faces a maximum of 584 years in prison and $5 million in fines and will be sentenced in December.

Tyler granted defense attorney Carl Bundick’s request that Smith undergo additional psychological evaluation prior to his sentencing, which likely will take place in December.

An earlier court-ordered evaluation found Smith was competent to stand trial, but concluded he was suffering from depression and was highly anxious.

Because of the large number of charges, Virginia Commonwealth Attorney Gary Agar did not make an oral statement of facts about each charge but instead submitted a two-page joint stipulation of facts signed by both attorneys.

The document was attached to a hefty summary report of Virginia State Police investigations of the fires — including addresses, property owners’ names, date of the fire and Smith’s statements about each one.

Bundick and Smith lived in Parksley, a small community where the first of 77 deliberately set fires was lit.

On March 14 Bundick wrote a message about the fires on her Facebook page.

'I have often wondered if arsonist is reading and laughs…I myself am not afraid just cautious…I am always on lookout when my animals start barking and when my livestock start making noise. Make (yourself) aware of the little things,' she said.
