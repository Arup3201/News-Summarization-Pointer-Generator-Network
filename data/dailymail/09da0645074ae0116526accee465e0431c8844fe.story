People in five areas of the UK will now have to dial the full area code to telephone local homes and businesses – as regulators claim we are running out of landline numbers.

The change, which came into effect on Wednesday, covers Aberdeen (01224), Bradford (01274), Brighton (01273), Middlesbrough (01642) and Milton Keynes (01908).

It means that people calling a local number must also include the area code when dialling – just as if they were using a mobile phone.

And if they forget, they will hear a recorded message asking them to include it.

The move, implemented by the telecoms watchdog Ofcom, is designed to create nearly one million new numbers for these locations. 

An Ofcom spokesman said the move is necessary to prevent the country running out of numbers, and that the changes can be adopted easily. Call costs will not be affected.

Ofcom is also planning to implement the same system in Oxford, Slough and Stoke-on-Trent from some point after 2016 with contingency plans in place for a further 20 cities to follow suit.

Among the many other locations under the spotlight are Swindon, Hull, York, Norwich, Guildford, Warwick Bath and Motherwell.

The industry regulator insists the shift is necessary to prevent the country running out of numbers, however research by the organisation suggests the public are sceptical about this claim.

The shift in telephone use towards mobile phones and calls made over the internet through services such as Skype suggests the demand for new landline numbers should be falling.

There is also some resistance to the fact that the change means people will need to dial an 11 digit number to reach a local take-away or family member.

Separately, it creates extra costs for small businesses and traders, who need to change letter heads and signs to show the full number, including the national code.

Currently, Ofcom cannot allocate local phone numbers where the first digit is 0 or 1. This is because the network computers may confuse the number with other existing dialling codes or with a number reserved for special use.

For example, the system would recognise 07 as a mobile number, 08 as a special rate, or 118 as directory enquiries.

Once consumers are required to use the national code, thousands of new numbers beginning 0 or 1 can be offered to families or businesses.

Ofcom insisted the changes can be adopted without too much inconvenience. It gives the example of Bournemouth, which adopted the new system in 2012.

The number of communications providers has increased significantly over the last ten years, leading to more competition and cheaper landline bills for millions of homes and businesses. But it has also led to increased pressure on the supply of new phone numbers.

A spokesman said: ‘Requiring landline callers to use the code locally is intended to safeguard the future supply of new landline numbers and avoid the need for more disruptive measures, such as changing existing phone numbers.

‘The supply of new landline numbers also ensures that consumers and businesses continue to enjoy the widest choice of telecoms providers.

‘The cost of calls will not be affected, and those who dial without the area code after the change will hear a recorded message asking them to include it.

‘The measure was first implemented in Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (the 01202 code area) in November 2012 and the process ran smoothly.’
