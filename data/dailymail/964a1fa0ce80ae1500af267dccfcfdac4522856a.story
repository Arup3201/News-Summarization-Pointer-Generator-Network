Fat cats at Britain's top companies have defied the financial crisis and awarded themselves pay rises that take average earnings to £4million.

While their basic salaries have remained roughly the same, FTSE-100 company bosses have benefited from an enormous 27 per cent increase in income thanks to incentive schemes.

News of their sky-high earnings will frustrate ordinary workers struggling to cope with austerity measures while those at the top continue to enjoy a 'champagne lifestyle'.

The steep increase, revealed by Incomes Data Services, is also likely to anger investors who have seen the value of their holdings slashed by disappointing performances at corporate giants.

The value of long-term incentive plans (LTIPs) rose by an average of 81 per cent to £938,000 for directors and £1.6m for chief executives in the year to June, said the IDS report.

Directors' pay increased by a median of 3.5 per cent, while the value of their bonuses fell by 4.9 per cent, the study found.

But this deficit was made up by incentive schemes, which are now used by more than 90 per cent of FTSE-100 firms.

LTIPs are usually granted in the form of shares and are closely linked to shareholder returns, with directors typically having to reach a minimum target before any shares are granted.

However, LTIPs are based on comparative performance with competitors, rather than a company's historical performance, so directors may be paid even if their company's performance has worsened, IDS revealed.

'Whether a reaction to Government pressure, shareholder concerns or a worse than expected business environment, it seems the brakes have been applied to the basic pay growth for FTSE-100 bosses,' said Steve Tatton of IDS.

'However, while shareholders will be pleased to see more traditional elements of pay seemingly slowing, these figures show that directors' earnings can still grow significantly as a result of a complex mix of incentives.'

TUC General Secretary Brendan Barber added: 'Directors have proved that executive pay structures are not fit-for-purpose by securing another huge earnings boost, even while ordinary workers suffer flat or even falling wages.

'An 81 per cent increase in long-term incentive plans when the economy is struggling to climb out of a double-dip recession shows just how flawed the so-called performance elements of directors' remuneration have become.

'We still have way to go to bring a sense of reality to executive pay and ensure that directors' pay is aligned with the long-term health of the company rather than simply its share price.'

Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said: 'While millions of working people are either without work, or having their pay frozen or slashed, Britain's boardrooms are finding even more devious ways to squeeze more cash from their companies.

'Wages for many working people have stagnated since 2003 and have fallen in real terms since the recession hit.

'But the richest have continued to pull ahead. The top 10 per cent have 12 times more income than the bottom 10 per cent. Scandalously, Britain has the fastest growing income inequality compared to other developed countries.

'What is particularly sickening is that some of the companies may be performing poorly - but the cash registers are always ringing for these directors.'

Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: 'The Government is guilty of allowing the gap between the rich at the top and those at the bottom to grow. It has used the recession to hold down wages in the public sector and cut jobs and services, while those at the top continue to enjoy a champagne lifestyle.

'It is clearly ridiculous that taxpayers are landed with a bill of between £6bn and £7bn a year for in-work benefits because scrooge bosses are lining their own pockets.'

Shareholders have fought back against excessive pay this year in an extraordinary show of strength, with the so-called ‘shareholder spring’ claiming senior scalps including Andrew Moss, chief executive of insurance giant Aviva, and Trinity Mirror’s Sly Bailey.

Yet surviving senior managers are only seeing increase in their pay packets.

The top earner was Angela Ahrendts, chief
executive of Burberry, which has just issued a profit warning but paid 
Ahrendts £15.9m.

WPP’s Sir Martin Sorrell, who suffered one of the biggest shareholder revolts on pay in recent history, was second with £14.2m.

Deborah Hargreaves, chairman of the High Pay Centre, said: ‘At a time of biting austerity for the economy, those at the top of our biggest companies are seeing their pay continue to increase sharply compared to everyone else.

‘The gap between rewards in the boardroom and those for the rest of society has opened up to unsustainable levels. Shareholders have tried to rein in some of the worst excesses this year, but this has only been partially successful.’
