A maths teacher at a £15,000 school is facing jail after being caught with an underage girl hidden under a blanket in the back of his car. 

Dr John Wunderle, who taught at Bancroft's School in Essex, was already on bail for alleged sexual offences with the same girl when witnesses discovered her hiding in the backseat of his car in August. 

The 35-year-old  admitted performing a sex act on the 15-year-old and grooming her as she approached her 16th birthday at Snaresbrook Crown Court today amid other sexual offences. 

Dr John Wunderle was a teacher at Bancroft's School in Essex before being caught with the girl hidden in the back of his car

The court heard how Wunderle, who lives with his mother in Waltham Abbey, had also coerced the girl into performing a sex act on him.   

Prosecution barrister Chris Stimpson said: 'He is 35 years old and a person of good character.

'The Crown will seek time to draft a sexual offences prevention order and a restraining order.'

Wunderle pleaded guilty to five charges  

Judge Neil Saunders adjourned the hearing for sentencing on November 14. 

Former pupils at the school in Essex include Alan Davies and tennis player Samantha Smith.
