Showing incredible strength as she drags a gazelle up a tree by the neck, this leopardess proves that there is nothing a mother will not do to get dinner on the table.

These images capture the moment a ruthless leopard kills a gazelle and drags the carcass up a tree before inviting her teenage cub to enjoy dinner al fresco in the top branches.

The leopardess was seen chasing the Grants gazelle across the savannah of Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, before slaying it and grabbing it by the neck.

After transporting her ‘Sunday roast’ 
to safety from other predators, the leopardess allows her cub to follow 
her up into the treetops where the pair ate the gazelle.

The pictures were by Archna Singh, a hobby photographer from New Delhi, India.

Archna
 said: ‘The leopardess looked beautiful, and as I sat there, happily 
taking as many pictures of her as I could, she surveyed the savannah.

‘When
 leopards make a kill, it is usually a tiring experience, and it was no 
different with this leopardess, who looked a little worn out after 
bagging the gazelle.

‘Her expressions, as you can see were mesmerizing.’
