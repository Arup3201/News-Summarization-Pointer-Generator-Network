Lumumba was held in custody for two weeks after Knox, 26, told police she had 'covered her ears as he killed' Meredith in her bedroom of the house she shared with her fellow student in Italy.

As a result of the false accusation, Lumumba was dragged from his home in front of his children and wife in a dawn raid and taken to jail only being released when a university professor provided him with a rock solid alibi.

Falsely accused: Lumumba was held in custody for two weeks because of Knox's claims - he later won damages for the ordeal

Now Knox, who was last month re-convicted along with ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito for Meredith's killing in Perugia in 2007, has admitted her guilt at accusing Lumbumba, which she has always claimed was as a result of pressure from police.

In a wide-ranging interview with the Guardian, she told how she has 'really struggled with what happened with Patrick' and, asked if she could understand why he hated her, replied: 'Yes, Patrick was greatly hurt by what happened and never got answers from me.

'Granted, I was in a position where I couldn't give answers. But if you read what I said after my interrogations, I said I could not testify against him, and yet his lawyer continues to say I was going to let him languish in prison...'

Knox said her false confession was as a result of threats from police and the mental strain caused by their interrogations.

Tragic: Knox says she still hopes to convince the Kercher family of her innocence and said she was still 'traumatised' by Meredith's death

Recalling the moment she made her false accusation, she said: 'When I named Patrick, I just started weeping. I thought, "Oh my God", it must be true what they're (the police) saying. I must have witnessed my friend's murder somehow and now I'm traumatised enough to not even remember it.'

Knox was convicted of slandering Lumumba and ordered to pay him 22,000 euros in 2011, and he was also later awarded 8,000 euros in damages by the Italian state but he rejected this to pursue a claim through the European Court of Human Rights.

Knox, who was this week given a lifeline when it emerged the judge who convicted her of the crime for a second time may have breached legal rules, also spoke of her determination to convince the Kercher family of her innocence, although she admitted it was a 'really big rock to overturn'.

The Seattle native, who is back studying in her home city, said she felt stranded and trapped by the latest verdict and was uncomfortable that the decision of a judge had cemented her reputation as a criminal in the eyes of the public.

She also said it was a struggle when meeting people at her college when new acquaintances realised her identity.

Knox, who maintains police have not a shred of evidence that she committed any crime, added she was trying to stay positive about her future.

Knox and Sollecito were charged with murdering and sexually assaulting Meredith in 2007, after she was found semi-naked and with her throat cut in the bedroom of her house in Perugia.

Initially, both were convicted in 2009 and Knox was sentenced to 26 years and Sollecito to 25 years but then in 2011 the verdicts were sensationally overturned and both were allowed to go free.

But last year, in a case that has been marked with numerous twists and turns, Italy's Supreme Court ordered a fresh retrial of the appeal and she was re-convicted last month.

She's been warned she faces extradition to Italy if she leaves America.
