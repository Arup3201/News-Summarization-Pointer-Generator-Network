John Bishop (pictured with his wife) has become embroiled in an access row at his £2million mansion

Comedian John Bishop has become embroiled in an access row at the grounds of his £2million mansion.

Local residents have reportedly complained about being denied access to a route on his land which they were previously allowed access to.

A spokesman for Mr Bishop has said the comedian maintains a public footpath at his own expense through the land, but changed the security code on a gate to his driveway, which the previous owner of the property allowed neighbours to have.

Mr Bishop, 47, bought the £2.25million ten-bedroom mansion, which is surrounded by 24 acres of landscaped lawns, last year.

According to The Sun, a resident has said the previous owner allowed neighbours access.

The resident went on to say an application had been put in to the local council.

A spokesman for Mr Bishop however has said: 'There is not a dispute about access over John Bishop's land. There is in fact a public footpath within his land, which is signposted and maintained at his expense.

'The dispute is about access to a private drive way and entrance via a gate with a security code. This road is private and has never been public.

'The previous owner allowed neighbours to have the code and enter via that gate. The code was understandably changed for security reasons and not redistributed on the advice of the police.

'The matter is not "dragging on" because of Mr Bishop. The facts are that the lead petitioner has refused contact from the council, as he has now moved from the area and as such, cannot claim to be involved. Mr Bishop wants it resolved asap.'

Lawyers for Mr Bishop meanwhile have told The Sun: 'Any suggestion our client has lost touch with his working-class roots is both untrue and would be defamatory.'

The current home of Mr Bishop, who grew up in a three-bedroom council property, features an inside swimming pool, tennis court and lake with an accompanying island.

On Saturday, the Daily Mail reported how Mr Bishop's new family home is the result of his remarkable rise from circuit stand-up comedian to household star who has made millions of pounds through TV appearances, sold-out stadium tours and impressive DVD sales.

Bishop’s autobiography How Did All This Happen? has also stormed the bestseller charts with more than 93,000 hardback copies sold since last year.

In the book the BBC star describes how he keeps his feet firmly on the ground with the help of a reminder of his less luxurious start in life - the street sign from where he grew up.

He describes how his brother Eddie ‘nicked’ the Severn Walk sign from the 1960s estate and presented it to him before a gig with the message: ‘So you don’t forget where you are from.’

Mr Bishop says the sign ‘now hangs in my 
kitchen, in pride of place’. He adds: ‘You can’t return to your 
childhood, but you don’t have to leave it, either.’

The star says growing up in the estate helped define him along with his sense of humour.

Having made his success, Mr Bishop adds he is keen to remain living in Cheshire and not make the move to London.

He said in a recent interview: ‘There are socialist elements ingrained in you if you’ve grown up on a council estate; it’s something I’m proud of. But I also don’t feel you should apologise for your success if you have managed to move on to good things.

‘I can’t see any reason to leave. It’s never crossed my mind. I think that if you live in the North of England you are a very, very lucky person. I can’t see myself in Primrose Hill drinking cappuccinos. This is where I belong.’

Mr Bishop gave up his successful job as a pharmaceutical salesman to concentrate on comedy in 2006.
