A mother of three has spoken about her anger and humiliation after she was visited by Child Protective Services for letting her 6-year-old son play outside unsupervised.

Children's book author Kari Anne Roy, who lives in Austin, Texas, wrote on her blog HaikuMama last week about how an unidentified neighbor rang her doorbell and told her she was returning her son.

The woman had spied Roy’s youngest, 6-year-old Isaac, sitting alone on a bench about 150 yards for his home and had approached him and asked where he lived.

‘Then the woman smiled condescendingly, explained that he was OUTSIDE. And he was ALONE. And she was RETURNING HIM SAFELY. To stay INSIDE. With an ADULT,’ wrote Roy. ‘I thanked her for her concern, quickly shut the door and tried to figure out what just happened.’

Not long after Roy received another knock at her door and was shocked to find a policewoman who was following up a complaint made by the neighbor, referred to by Roy as a busybody.

The police woman quizzed Roy about her children and asked if her son had been missing.

Then a week later Roy received a visit from Child Protective Services who also wanted up to question her and her children.

A neighbor found Roy's 6-year-old Isaac sitting alone on the bench and returned him to his mom's house

‘My eight year old was very concerned about the questions that were asked, like had she seen people's private parts or those types of movies, and those are things she had not really thought of or known existed,’ Roy said.

Roy took to her blog to express her anger saying she was ‘struck dumb’ by the fact anyone would question her parenting.

‘I was humiliated and really angry after that. Really, really angry,’ Roy told KEYE.

Roy also defended her decision to let her son out on his own and said the bench was visible from my front porch and that Isaac had been playing with my 8-year-old daughter until a couple of minutes before the busybody arrived. 

The mom-of-three also says that she understands why the CPS had to by law investigate the incident. 

Roy says she was 'humiliated and really angry' after a busybody neighbor called the police expressing concerning for the welfare of her children

 

'Having CPS have to come to a house because a child was playing outside takes away their time and resources from investigating the kids that really need it,' Roy said.

The incident month early in August and Roy only felt it was safe to blog about the experience after she was informed last week that the case was officially closed. 

When Roy asked the CPS investigator what happened next, she was advised not to let her children play outside for fear of another complaint.
