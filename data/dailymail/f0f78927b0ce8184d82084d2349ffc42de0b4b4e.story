Syrian rebels turned a captured tank on government forces today and bombarded a military airbase boosting their firepower in the week-long battle for the country's commercial capital Aleppo.

President Bashar al-Assad's troops meanwhile pounded the strategic Salaheddine district in Aleppo itself with tank and artillery fire while rebels tried to consolidate their hold on areas they have seized.

In the capital Damascus, troops overran a suburb yesterday killing at least 35 people, mostly unarmed civilians, residents and activist organisations said.

Captured weapons: Syrian rebels captured a tank and used it against government forces, boosting their firepower in a week-long battle for commercial capital Aleppo

The fighting for Syria's two biggest cities highlights the country's rapid slide into full scale civil war 17 months on from the peaceful street protests that marked the start of the anti-Assad uprising.

It comes as Former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan announced today that he would step down as the U.N. Arab League mediator in the 17 month conflict at the end of the month.

U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon said in a statement: 'Mr Annan has informed me, and the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States, Mr Nabil Elaraby, of his intention not to renew his mandate when it expires on 31 August 2012.

'Kofi Annan deserves our profound 
admiration for the selfless way in which he has put his formidable 
skills and prestige to this most difficult and potentially thankless of 
assignments.'

World powers have watched with 
mounting concern as diplomatic efforts to find a negotiated solution 
have faltered and violence that has already claimed an estimated 18,000 
lives worsens.

The rebels' morale was boosted when they turned a government tank's gun on the Menakh airbase 25 miles north of Aleppo, a possible staging post for reinforcements for the army's attack on Aleppo.

A rebel fight said: ‘We hit the airport using a tank that we captured from the Assad army. 

‘We attacked the airport a few times but we have decided to retreat at this time.’

The
 pro-opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said government 
forces at the airbase had used artillery and rocket launchers to bombard
 the town of Tel Rifaat, which lies between the airbase and Aleppo.

Boosted morale: Rebel fighters load an anti-aircraft machine gun in Atareb, a town 15 miles east of Aleppo as their morale is boosted after using the captured government tank against the army

Heavy weapons fire was heard this morning from Salaheddine in southwest Aleppo, a gateway to the city of 2.5 million people that has been fought over for the past week.

Heavily armed government troops are trying to drive a force of a few thousand rebel fighters from the city in battles whose outcome could be a turning point in the conflict.

Although government forces have made concerted efforts to take Salaheddine, a full out assault on the city as a whole has yet to take place.

Mobile phone connections have been cut since Wednesday evening, leading to speculation among residents that an increase in military action might be imminent.

Prepared to fight: Rebel forces have been consolidating areas they control in Aleppo, attacking police posts and minor military installations. They claim to have seized three police stations this week

Big city barrage: The latest fighting in Syria's two biggest cities, Aleppo and Damascus, is causing mounting concern among world powers

Facing tanks and artillery in Salaheddine, a shattered neighbourhood that straddles a highway into the south, rebels said they planned an offensive elsewhere in the region but did not disclose their objective.

The rebels are consolidating areas they control in Aleppo, attacking police posts and minor military installations with some success. They claim to have seized three police stations this week.

In Damascus, still a government stronghold but a scene of combat in the past two weeks, government troops faced new accusations of atrocities after their attack yesterday.

A resident, who gave his name as Fares, said by phone from from Jdeidet Artouz, southwest of Damascus: ‘When the streets were clear we found the bodies of at least 35 men.

‘Almost all of them were executed with bullets to their face, head and neck in homes, gardens and basements.’

Disappeared: Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has not spoken in public since a bomb attack on his inner circle two weeks ago causing concern for his safety

Syrian state television said ‘dozens of 
terrorists and mercenaries surrendered or were killed’ when the army 
raided Jdeidet Artouz and its surrounding farmlands.

In a rallying cry to his troops on Wednesday, Assad said their battle against rebels would decide Syria's fate.

In a shift toward increased foreign involvement in the war, U.S. President Barack Obama signed a secret order authorizing American support for the rebels, according to U.S. sources familiar with the matter.

The order, approved earlier this year, broadly permits the CIA and other U.S. agencies to provide support that could help the rebels oust Assad. 

The lightly armed insurgents are battling a well-equipped army that has overwhelming superiority on paper. But the rebels have managed to capture some tanks and heavy weapons and their ranks are swelled by army defectors.

The rebels, however, are united mostly by loathing of Assad, and have failed to come together despite pressure from the West, Turkey and Sunni-ruled Arab states who back their cause.

But his call-to-arms, in a written statement, gave no clues to his whereabouts two weeks after a bomb attack on his inner circle.

Assad, who succeeded his late father Hafez 11 years ago to perpetuate the family's rule of Syria, has not spoken in public since the bombing in Damascus killed four of his close security aides, although he has appeared in recorded clips on television.

His low public profile suggests acute concern about his safety since the attack in which his brother-in-law died.

Amid growing signs that the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo is getting worse, the World Food Programme said it was sending emergency food supplies for up 28,000 people.

The fighting in Salaheddine district, part of a rebel-held arc stretching to the northeast of Aleppo, has left neither side in full control.

On Al-Sharqeya Street, residents and shop owners looked in awe at the damage. Some searched through what was left of their buildings - huge piles of concrete and twisted metal.

As he abandoned his home, Abu Ahmed said: ‘I saw death before my eyes.

‘I was hiding in the alleyway of my building when I heard the whiz of the artillery. Look at my street now.’

They said the damage was caused by 
helicopter fire targeting a rebel brigade based in a school. It missed 
the school and hit the residential buildings instead.

Destruction: It is not just the devastation of buildings and homes that is killing thousands, but food is running short with the World Food Programme sending emergency food supplies for up to 28,000 people

Mr Ahmed, holding just a plastic bag with his meagre belongings, said: ‘This dog Assad and his men are so blind they can't even target a brigade properly.

State television said yesterday that the army was pursuing remaining ‘terrorists’ in one Aleppo district and had killed several, including foreign Arab fighters.

Some foreign fighters, including militant Islamists, have joined the battle against Assad, who accuses outside powers of financing and arming the insurgents.

Aleppo, a commercial hub with a historic Old City, had long stayed aloof from the uprising, but many of its 2.5 million residents are now caught up in battle zones, facing shortages of food, fuel, water and cooking gas.

Thousands have fled and hospitals and makeshift clinics can barely cope with casualties after more than a week of combat.

World Food Programme said: ‘The humanitarian situation is deteriorating in Aleppo and food needs are growing rapidly.’
