The mother and her two young children who were killed in their New York home as part of a murder-suicide have been laid to rest by distraught family and friends.

More than 300 mourners gathered in Trevose, Pennsylvania, for the funerals of 46-year-old Amy Friedlander, and her children Molly, 10, and Gregory, eight, as the rabbi conducting the service spoke of the 'anger' and 'unspeakable grief that we are feeling'.

Police say Sam Friedlander, 50, bludgeoned his banker wife to death with a chair leg last Tuesday, then shot his children in their beds before killing himself in the basement of their Westchester home.

Laid to rest: The funerals of Amy Friedlander and her two young children, Molly and Gregory, took place in Pennsylvania on Saturday, before a memorial yesterday

Remembered: Amy, left, was a generous and adoring mother, mourners said, while her children Gregory, eight, and Molly, 10, right, were athletic and fun-loving

Community: More than 300 mourners attended the service

At the Joseph Levine and Sons Memorial Chapel on Saturday, near where Amy grew up, her husband's face was noticeably missing from the photo collages in the lobby, while throughout the ceremony, his name was never mentioned.

'How could this have happened? It can't be real,' said a tearful Gary Perez, Amy's father, according to the New York Post.

Mr Perez was reportedly too upset to say the final kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead.

'There is a hole in the world where Amy, Molly and Gregory are supposed to be,' said Rabbi Craig Axler, who conducted the service.

'There are simply no words to prepare anyone for the unspeakable grief that we are feeling here today,' he said, according to the New York Daily News.

'There are no words to describe the anger or lack of justice we are experiencing here today. We come here as a family and community that is torn.'

Killer: Sam Friedlander, 50, shot his two young children while they slept before bludgeoning his wife to death and then turning the gun on himself at his suburban home

On the market: The couple were reportedly going through a messy divorce and their $800,000 Cross River home, where the murders took place, had been put up for sale

When Mr Axler was a new rabbi almost eight years ago, he did a baby naming for Gregory, the Journal News reported.

Amy was remembered as a loving mother and generous friend, Gregory a promising athlete with an infectious laugh and Molly a good friend, who was always inclusive. A cousin laid a 'best friends' necklace and a ladybug Pillow Pet on Molly's coffin, the New York Daily News reported.

The three caskets were positioned side-by-side, with large fall floral arrangements on top.

'My sister, my best friend, Amy, you were taken away from me too soon,' said a tearful Jill Gobora, according to the New York Daily News. 'I wish in your lifetime you could have truly appreciated how funny, pretty, kind, and intelligent you really were.'

'You were such a loving, caring, and devoted mother,' she continued. 'Molly and Gregory were such wonderful children because of you and only you.

'My heart will ache for you every day.'

The three were then buried in Montefiore Cemetery in Rockledge, before a memorial service yesterday at Jewish Family Congregation in South Salem, where the family were members.

At yesterday's memorial service, a video in the Levine chapel lobby showed the mother and children during happy times â€” touring Hollywood, picking out Halloween pumpkins and celebrating birthdays, The Journal News reported.

Amy and Sam Friedlander were going through a divorce and had encountered financial difficulties. Their four-bedroom $800,000 Cross River house was on the market.
