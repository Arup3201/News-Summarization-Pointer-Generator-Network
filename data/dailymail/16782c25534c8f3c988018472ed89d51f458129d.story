A pit-bull has died after being repeatedly stabbed during a pet adoption event in Georgia, where the dog bit a smaller pooch inside a PetSmart store while dozens of horrified adults and children watched.

Witnesses say 3-year-old pit-bull Clara somehow got off its leash — charging and biting a small Westie Terrier at the Newnan PetSmart on Sunday, the Newnan Times-Herald reported.

The terrier's owner, Craig Emory Hayes, told police the pit-bull grabbed his dog Lexie by its ear and began to pull it while Hayes yelled for someone to help, CBS46 reported.

He at first punched the dog, according to the police report. Once Clara wouldn't let go, he pulled out a pocket knife and began to stab the dog, the Times-Herald reported.

The newspaper reported that Hayes yelled 'f***ing pit-bull!' while he stabbed the dog repeatedly.

Clara later had to be euthanized due to her stab wounds.

'It is the worst thing I've ever seen,' eyewitness Teresa Reeves, told WXIA-TV.

'We heard screaming at the front of the store and went running to see what was happening,' added Reeves, who was at the store with her fiance and 10-year-old daughter. 'The pit bull had the smaller dog at the back of the neck holding the loose skin and fur there.'

There were at least three dozen people at the store during the incident, many of them children.

'The pit bull came charging past me and 
my family and straight towards this small dog who was on a leash,' wrote eyewitness Kathy Stottlar, who said she was standing a foot from the incident, on Facebook.

'His 
owner was checking him in or out at the vet hospital. The pit was not on
 a leash. Don’t know if he broke his leash or whoever had him lost his 
grip or what. It was terrifying.'

Both dogs were taken to a local vet. The Westie Terrier Lexie suffered minor injuries.

'After 3 hours at emergency clinic, 
sweet Lexie had to stay overnight, the wounds in her neck are building 
up fluid, her ear is tore up, and her eye has an hematoma and ripped up 
her forehead, looks terrible with blood building up in eye!' wrote owner Tracie Hayes on Facebook.

'Lots of 
antibiotics, shots and rest, will be better in about two weeks, said the
 vet. Craig said she was crying like crazy when he left. Poor baby.'

The Newnan-Coweta Humane Society set up a Facebook page to spread the word about the adoption efforts for Clara

Reeves' fiance, Mike Wohler, told the Times-Herald that Craig Hayes should be prosecuted.

'He straight murdered this dog in front of 30, 40 people,' he told the paper. 'He didn’t like pit bulls. This just gave him the excuse he needed.'

No arrests have been made.

In its adoption page for Clara, the Newnan-Coweta Humane Society says the pit-bull 'can be particular of other animal companions.' The description has since been removed.

A Facebook page asking for 'Justice for Clara' had garnered more than 5,700 followers by early afternoon on Tuesday, with hundreds of people adding their support each hour.
