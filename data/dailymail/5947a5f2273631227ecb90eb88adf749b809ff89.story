Stephen Sutton’s mother has spoken for the first time of her anger that her son’s cancer took six months to diagnose since his death.

Stephen raised nearly £5million for charity before he died after a four year battle with bowel cancer and was awarded the MBE for his efforts.

He touched people across the world when a bucket list containing the 40 things he hoped to do before his death went viral.

The 19-year-old helped raise almost £5million for cancer research charities after his struggle with bowel cancer went viral 

The teenager's mother Jane Sutton (pictured) said she was immensely proud of her son, but claims doctors could have done more. They are pictured with David Cameron and Professor Gary Middleton earlier this year

But yesterday Jane Sutton, 50, told of how doctors insisted that the 19-year-old was suffering from constipation – despite concerns raised by the family that the condition was far more serious.

At the time, Stephen, aged 15, was suffering from pain, weight loss and fatigue – three of symptoms of bowel cancer.

She told an event organised by the Teenage Cancer Trust that doctors ‘completely ignored’ the possibility that he may be suffering from cancer.

His 'weird and wonderful' bucket list included skydiving and organising a charity gig

Mrs Sutton told of how she had made doctors aware that there was a history of Lynch Syndrome, a genetic condition which increases the risk of bowel cancer, in the family.

She said the family had even taken a booklet about the condition to doctors.

Mrs Sutton told the conference yesterday: ‘Stephen wasn’t a child who went to the doctors.

‘He had gone from being a healthy, sporty young lad to having three of the signs of cancer, plus a family history, and all of that was ignored. It is not good enough, really.’

His most important goal on the bucket list was to raise £10,000, but he also visited Number 10 Downing Street

She stressed the importance of GPs listening to young patients and their parents so that early signs were not overlooked.

In an interview with the Mail before his death, Stephen said: ‘On the whole, the NHS has been brilliant, but there will always be a kind of . . .Well, probably just anger.’

He added: ‘There always will be anger. If it had been caught earlier it could have led to a better prognosis. It could have changed the situation.

‘But even saying that, I’m not one to dwell on the past. It is what it is.’

Yesterday Labour MP Debbie Abrahams, chair of Labour’s Health Committee, said it was ‘not acceptable’ for young patients to be ‘fobbed off’.
