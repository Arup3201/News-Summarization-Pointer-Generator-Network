House Majority Leader Eric Cantor was dramatically defeated Tuesday in a Virginia GOP primary,  crushed at the hands of a little-known economics professor – a stunning upset and the highest-profile scalp on the Tea Party's growing trophy wall.

The seven-term congressman lost by a 55-44 margin to Dave Brat, a political novice with little money, marking a huge victory for the same conservative insurgent movement that supported Cantor just a few years ago.

'I know there’s a lot of long faces here tonight,' Cantor told supporters after conceding the race to Brat. 'It’s disappointing, 
sure.'

'Obviously, we came up short.'

Cantor is the second-most powerful member of the U.S. House and was touted as a likely successor to House Speaker John Boehner.

He is the first House Majority leader in American history to lose his party's primary.

Don't Tread On Me: Tea party pick Dave Brat celebrates in front of hundreds of supporters after snatching the Republican nomination for congress away from Cantor in a stunning upset that no one in the pundit class saw coming

In
 2004, South Dakota Democratic Sen. Tom Daschle lost re-election to a 
Republican while he was the sitting Senate Majority Leader. But that 
loss didn't come at the hands of a fellow Democrat.

Virginia law prohibits Cantor from running 
as an independent once he has contested a party's primary. He has told the Associated Press that he won't run as a write-in candidate, effectively ending his political career.

The voters in Cantor's very conservative congressional district spoke loud and clear, leading conservative activist Brent Bozell told 
reporters Tuesday night.

'Eric 
Cantor's loss tonight is an apocalyptic moment for the GOP 
establishment,' Bozell said. 'The grassroots is in revolt and marching.'

Dave Brat, the Randolph-Macon College economics professor who unseated House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, has a lot more going for him than his policy visions.

'Total eye candy': Brat is liked by his students

Brat's students appreciate how he looks in a cardigan more than his approach to teaching and politics.

His hotness rating on the site is a glowing red chili pepper - just a notch down from the site's best rating of combusting chili pepper.

'He's so charming,' wrote one, 'and really knows how to incorporate real world examples to keep the class exciting and relateable [sic].'

'He change[s] assignments a lot and sometimes it's unclear what he wants you to do. Plus he's total eye candy!!'

Another said: 'Brat changes assignments all the time, but he is so charming, you forget to be mad at him'.

'Not a great teacher,' wrote another. 'Great guy, but almost too smart to teach.'

A third seemed to mock his conservative street-cred: 'I was excited to take a class from a guy who promised to put a stop to immigrant "amnesty," but at least 3 people in class were somewhat Mexican-looking and he did not deport a single one of them all semester. Also, requires purchase of 2 copies of "Atlas Shrugged" for some reason. Coffee breath.'

Bozell is chairman of ForAmerica, an organization that has targeted moderate Republicans, including Cantor.

Brat said after the race was called in his favor that his push to unseat Cantor had found a receptive audience among voters who were weary of partisan bickering – and of infighting within the GOP.

'The American people want to pay attention to serious ideas again,' he told a Fox News Channel audience.

'Our founding was built by people who were political philosophers and we need to get back to that, away from this kind of cheap political rhetoric of right and left.'

Brat added: 'God acted through people on my behalf. It’s an unbelievable miracle.'

Most Republican pollsters and election consultants were genuinely stunned by the results on Tuesday.

One poll of 400 likely Republican primary voters conducted in late May for the Cantor campaign and shared with The Washington Post showed the incumbent with an improbable 62-28 lead.

The McLaughlin & Associates opinion research firm said that its margin of error was +/- 4.9 percentage points, but it was off by 27.

Six hours before the polls closed, the venerable Post predicted that Brat would 'fall far short.'

'Disorganization and poor funding have stymied the campaign of tea party activist David Brat,' read the opening salvo of a premature political obituary, 'even as he tapped into conservative resentment toward a party leader who has been courting the Republican right for years.'

Cantor founded the 
Republican Party's 'Young Guns' program along with 2012 vice presidential 
candidate Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy 
of California.

They created the initiative in 2007 as a support system for a new generation of GOP candidates 
running for open congressional seats or trying to unseat Democrat incumbents.

But the program grew to take all comers after the National Republican Congressional Committee endorsed it – including challengers to sitting congressmen like 
Cantor himself.

Brat had 
been a thorn in Cantor's side on the campaign trail, casting the 
congressman as a Washington insider who isn't conservative enough.

Last month, a feisty crowd of Brat supporters booed Cantor in front of his family at a local party convention.

Cantor's
 fuzzy position on immigration reform became a focal point of the race when Brat attacked his rival for what he said was a full embrace of 'amnesty' for illegal immigrants.

'Eric Cantor believes that we need to import more low-wage foreign 
workers at the expense of lower wages and fewer jobs for Virginia 
families,' Brat told the Richmond Times-Dispatch in an election survey that appeared in the paper on Monday.

'A vote for Eric Cantor is a vote for open
 borders and corporate handouts,' Brat continued.

Cantor has insisted that he opposes a quick path to citizenship for people living in the U.S. illegally.

But he said
 he could be open to limited programs, like one that would offer green 
cards to young people brought to the U.S. by their parents, once they 
served a term in the military.

He
 told the Times-Dispatch in his own survey responses that he believes 
'the immigration system is broken and we should make reforms in a 
step-by-step approach.'

But, added Cantor, 'I
 do not and will not accept the president’s all-or-nothing approach.'

He
 also rejected a comprehensive immigration reform bill – which tea 
partiers derided as a 'blanket amnesty' program – that has passed in the
 Senate but stalled in the House.

Pro-immigration
 activists seemed to relish the chance to leverage the issue against a 
powerful Republican.

Twice in the last six months they protested
 against Cantor in the lobby of his Arlington, Virginia condominium 
building.

A
 jubilant group of amnesty advocates showed up to gloat at Cantor's 
election-night headquarters following his concession speech.

Si, se puede: Immigration reform activists crashed Cantor's election-night party, jubilant about bouncing him from office -- but perhaps not thinking ahead to the tea partier Brat's likely win in a heavily Republican district

The thrill is gone: Cantor supporters couldn't hide their shock and disappointment when election returns came in and the news got progressively worse

Brat's message apparently scored well with voters in the 7th District, which 
includes part of Virginia's capitol city Richmond.

He prevailed by
 a double-digit margin.

'There
 needs to be a change,' said Joe Mullins, who voted in Chesterfield 
County Tuesday. The engineering company employee said he has friends who
 tried to arrange town hall meetings with Cantor, who declined their 
invitations.

A major 
rift between the GOP's establishment wing and tea party factions has 
been a fixture in 
Virginia since last year when tea party favorite Ken Cuccinelli lost the
 governor's race to former Democratic National Committee chairman Terry 
McAuliffe.

Cantor
 supporters responded by trying to wrest control of
 the state party away from conservatives with tea party leanings, including in the majority leader's home district.

But Tuesday's election result shows that the last laugh belongs to the 'Don't Tread On Me' crowd.

Brat
 teaches economics at Randolph-Macon College, a small liberal arts school north of
 Richmond.

He raised barely $200,000 for his campaign, according
 to the most recent financial disclosure reports. The New York Times reported that Cantor’s campaign splashed out close to that amount just at steakhouses ($168,637).

Cantor, by comparison, sat on a war chest of roughly $2 million. Politico reported
 that he spent $120,000 printing campaign mailers, $13,000 on yard 
signs, $370,000 on campaign ads and $30,000 on polling.

Prominent
 national conservative groups spent their own money to help Brat, who 
also offset his financial and name-recognition disadvantages with 
endorsements from conservative radio host Laura Ingraham and other 
conservative activists.  

Heir no more: Cantor was considered the likely successor to House Speaker John Boehner (L), but instead his has become the highest-profile scalp on the tea party's wall

'He really just didn’t have very much money, but what he did have was a lot of heart,' Ingraham told The New York Times.

'I think there will be a lot of people out there saying this could be the beginning of something really big for the Republican Party.'

Brat
 will now advance to the general election, where he will face off against Democratic Party nominee Jack Trammell, another professor at Randolph-Macon College. He teaches sociology.

Within hours of the race's conclusion, Trammell's homespun campaign website was scrapped entirely, in favor or a flashier fundraising engine from ActBlue, a firm that boasts it has raised $515 million for Democrats since 2004.

Republicans
 have represented Virginia's 7th congressional district
 since 1971 and its residents have not voted to elect a Democratic 
president for more than 20 years, giving Brat a significant advantage in November.

Cantor, a former state legislator, was elected to Congress in 2000. He became the Republicans' majority leader in 2011.
