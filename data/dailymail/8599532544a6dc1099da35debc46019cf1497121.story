Tyler Hawkins says he was told by his teacher to colour in his trainers black to fit with school uniform policy

A mother has hit out after her son was ordered to colour the white parts of his trainers with a black marker pen to comply with his school's uniform code.

Tyler Hawkins, 15, was hauled out of a lesson when a teacher spotted the white 'swoosh' and soles on his Nike shoes.

Tyler says the teacher then handed him a black marker pen and asked him to 'colour in' the black footwear.

His mother Gemma, 38, has been left furious by the incident and is considering removing Tyler and his 12-year-old sister from Newquay's Tretherras School and stopping her youngest son from starting there in September.

She said: 'What makes me so annoyed is that he's been 
wearing these shoes since September and nobody's said anything.

'Uniforms
 cost a lot of money as it is. I've got three children and I don't get 
any help.

'It's annoyed me so much I feel like being a rebel myself and 
making him buy an orange pair.'

Tyler
 was first given an old pair of black 
plimsolls to wear despite them being a size too 
small. His
 mother, of Newquay, Cornwall, sent her lad back the next day in his 
original footwear along with a note saying he wouldn't be changing them.

But
 staff at the school came up with an even more drastic solution - and 
gave him the pen.

The uniform policy at the 1,620-pupil secondary school
 states that children must wear 'plain black shoes'.

Tyler's mother insists her children are always neat and tidy and says the school's uniform policy is petty and 'over-the-top'.

She
 says her children have previously complained about being made to wear 
jumpers and blazers during one of the hottest 
springs on record.

She added: 'These are petty little things that don't make any difference or get in the way of children's learning.

'What the school's doing is encouraging bullying by pointing out all the poor kids who can't afford to buy new uniforms.'

Tyler's mother, Gemma, says the rules are 'petty and over-the-top' and could even encourage bullying

Headteacher Sarah Goswell said she was unable to comment directly on the complaint without speaking to the child and parent involved.

But she said she was not aware of any teacher asking children to colour in items of clothing to meet uniform regulations.

Ms Goswell said: 'It's not standard practice, but I'd be lying if I said it didn't happen because I don't know.

'It's very rare for us to be pulling students out of lessons. We've pulled students out of form time between 8:40am and 9am but it would be very unusual for us to do that.

'Details of the uniform are on our website, and in student planners, and we send out letters to parents on a regular basis. We're not petty about it, but we want our kids looking smart.

'We're very keen to keep up the standards of the uniform but we're very tolerant with it coming up to the end of term. There has to be a bit of give and take and we realise that.'
