While Here Comes Honey Boo Boo star Mama June continues to deny that she's had any recent contact with convicted child molester Mark McDaniel, he has been pictured laying low with a mystery woman.

McDaniel, 53, was photographed on Wednesday with the gray haired lady at his home in Decatur, Georgia. It is the first sighting of the ex-con since the story of his alleged relationship with June Shannon broke last Thursday.

The pair were spotted getting out of a vehicle and entering his home which has a makeshift sign taped to the front door that reads: 'Private property - No trepass (sic) - No comment'.

The unnamed woman, who may be a relative, towered over the ex-con who was only released from jail in March after serving ten years for abusing of June’s oldest daughter Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell, when she was eight.

Less than 80 miles away, Mama June was photographed putting on a show of togetherness with her ex Sugar Bear in a desperate bid to save their floundering reality TV careers following the shocking revelations.

The couple left the little famous white house in McIntyre, Georgia, with their beloved daughter nine-year-old Alana ‘Honey Boo Boo’ - after which the hit-TV show is named – on Wednesday in the full glare of the media.

Unemployed Mike ‘Sugar Bear’ Thompson took the wheel of a top of the range Chevrolet Suburban to drive into nearby Milledgeville, accompanied by an anxious-looking bodyguard.

McDaniel has been laying low in recent days since news of his relationship with Mama June broke and lead to the cancellation of the hit TLC show Here Comes Honey Boo Boo

The entourage stopped at a branch of the SunTrust bank before doing some grocery shopping at Walmart and booking an appointment at a hair salon at the Milledgeville Mall.

The family happily signed autographs and posed for photographs with members of the public who stopped them in the street.

Mama June and Sugar Bear declined to answer whether they were back together again, following their split earlier this year amid accusations of infidelity.

Sugar Bear replied, ‘No comment’, when asked by MailOnline if the couple were back together. Mama June refused to answer the question.

Everyone has an opinion: One on-looker said: ‘It’s interesting that they are walking around together after all that bad stuff about Mama June's dating sex offenders’

Staying mum: Sugar Bear replied, ‘No comment’, when asked by MailOnline if the couple were back together. Mama June refused to answer the question

However skeptics have claimed the outing was more to do with the cancellation of the latest TV series than true love.

One onlooker said: ‘It’s interesting that they are walking around together after all that bad stuff about Mama June's dating sex offenders.’

The couple are rumored to have earned more than $20,000 for each episode.

TV executives at TLC cancelled the next series of the hit series Here Comes Honey Boo Boo last month following revelations that Mama June was dating a convicted sex offender.

Running errands: The trio were seen leaving a bank, flanked by bodyguards for protection 

Costume shopping? The family were seen exiting WalMart, with Mama June pushing a trolley which appeared to contain Halloween items 

What scandal? The trio wore big grins, perhaps hoping to put on a happy front amid the scandal 

Earlier on Wednesday the TV star insisted that her children are her top priority despite damning evidence that she has allowed them to be in contact with the man who molested her own daughter. 

However in video obtained by MailOnline, Mama June maintained that she had not recently spoken to McDaniel.

She said: 'The protection of my kids is my number one priority.

Just like any other day: The family were seen offloading their purchases into their car 

Family affair: Mama June rifled through her handbag while Sugar Bear and Honey Boo Boo finished unpacking the groceries 

'We are handling this as a family matter. We are doing it behind closed doors, that's how I am. I'm very quiet. I love my family... We're handling what happens privately.'

She added: 'I have to think about my family, my kids, I have a lot of things to think about,' she said on the video. 'My kids are my number one priority.'

Her comments come just days after she posted an unapologetic video to Facebook insisting that reports of her having a relationship with McDaniel were false.

Dutiful daughter: Honey Boo Boo pushed the empty shopping cart back to the store as the family prepared to leave 

'The statement of me dating a sex offender is totally untrue,' she said. 'I would not ever, ever, ever, ever put my kids in danger.'

But photographs have emerged showing evidence to the contrary, including an image of them together in bed.

Another photograph reveals Mama June sitting on a staircase with daughter Honey Boo Boo behind her. McDaniel sits behind the child, with his hand on her shoulder.

Big day of shopping: The trio were seen leaving a Bath And Body Works at twilight 

Staying close: Mama June and Sugar Bear walked together to their car 

No bad blood? Sugar Bear even put a protective hand on June's back during the outing 

Despite Mama June's protests, TLC announced they are cancelling the series over how she has allowed contact between McDaniel and her children.

The concerns come just months after McDaniel was released from his 10-year prison sentence for aggravated child molestation.

A sickening police report from 2003 shows how, after revealing the abuse to her elementary school teacher, Anna told the officer that McDaniel molested her in June's bedroom while she was at work.

Leading the way: Honey Boo Boo walked a few steps ahead of her parents, smiling for the camera 

She told authorities that she had done the 'S word' with  McDaniel, the report published by RadarOnline revealed.

Anna also told police that her mother's boyfriend touched her inappropriately, made her touch him inappropriately and forced her to perform a sex act on him. When she told him to stop, he would not, the report claims.

McDaniel abused Anna multiple times between April and October 2002 but the youngster took months to speak out because McDaniel had threatened to kill her if she told, RadarOnline reported.

Star style: June showed off her freshly styled hair after a visit to the hair salon 

'Anna stated that Mark told her not to tell because he would not like her anymore,' the police report said. 'Anna advised she got tired of holding it in and had to tell.'

Speaking to the National Enquirer in 2012, Anna's ex-boyfriend added: 'Anna told me that McDaniel threatened that if she ever told her grandparents what happened to her, he’d kill them and her.

According to Spalding County Superior Court documents obtained by RadarOnline, Anna's younger sister Lauryn - then just three - was beside her in the bed on at least one occasion. 

Alleged perpatrator: Mama June has been pictured with Mark McDaniel, 53, who was jailed for 10 years for abusing her daughter, Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell, when she was eight

McDaniel was indicted in Spalding County for rape, child molestation, aggravated child molestation, enticing a child for indecent purposes and aggravated sexual battery.

The pervert was sentenced to 10 years behind bars after pleading guilty to child molestation. He left prison in March and has reportedly been seeing Mama June again.

Earlier this week, Anna revealed to People magazine that when she told her mother what McDaniel had done to her, June did not believe her.

Back in her life: Mama June is pictured beside her nine-year-old daughter Alana, also known as Honey Boo Boo, and her former boyfriend Mark McDaniel (back), who was jailed for assaulting her older daughter

'A week or so after it happened, I talked to Mama and she was upset, crying and saying, "I don't believe you, I don't believe you, why would you do this to me?"' she remembered.

'And I was like, "Mama, he did that to me and I can't do anything about it. You were never there to see it. You were always at work".'

McDaniel is not the only sex offender Mama June has dated.

She also went out with Michael Anthony Ford, 37, the father of her 17-year-old daughter Jessica 'Chubbs' Shannon.

Devastated: Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell sobs in the arms of Entertainment Tonight correspondent Nischelle Turner as she talks about how hurt she is that her mother has been seen with her molester

Moving on: Anna, left with her husband and right with their daughter, said she is hurt by reports that her mother could be back together with her abuser - and that they will not be allowed to come near her child

After the pair split, he served more than two years in prison for the sexual exploitation of a child over the internet in 2005 and remains on the sex offender registry.

According to prison records, Ford is currently behind bars on a separate child abandonment charge.

The fathers of Shannon’s other children also have criminal records but rather than being sex-related their crimes included arson and burglary.

Sugar Bear was left shattered by the breakup of his relationship with Mama June earlier this year, friends have claimed. The split followed allegation that he had been looking at internet dating sites on the internet.

This week his friend, ‘Crazy Tony’ Lindsay revealed Sugar Bear was worried about the safety of his beloved daughter Honey Boo Boo and was considering fighting for custody.
