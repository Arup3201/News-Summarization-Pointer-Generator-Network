For a recipient who likes gobbling and imbibing, a Christmas hamper is always a reliably strong gift.

But most of us giving such a chest of treats would likely fill it with a couple of bottles of plonk, a wedge of brie, a jar of pickled something-or-other and a kicky little chocolate selection box.

Few of us would stretch to the Harrods Decadence hamper, a treasure trove of 59 goodies - including 25 bottles of wine and spirits, gold leaf marmalade, Beluga caviar and truffled foie gras - that will set the buyer back a cool £20,000.

The Harrods Decadence Christmas hamper will cost you £20,000, but it does include truffled caviar, a salmon fillet, plenty of cheese and a box of crackers costing £599 each

The enormous collection has been pieced together by Harrods food experts, and is sure to delight the tastebuds of any one who could afford the hefty price tag.

As well as the bundle of pricely gourmet goodies, the recipient of this gift, will have Christmas made easy, as it includes a Christmas cake, cheese boards, table decorations and a box of six Southern Cross Christmas crackers which individually have a £599 price tag.

The six - all painstakingly constructed - look slightly more extra special 
than your average cracker and include no bad jokes and silly paper hats. Instead they are filled with jewellery, leather wallets and fountain pens.

Along with 25 bottles of wines and spirits - including a 2004 magnum of Dom Perignon and a Balvenie Thirty Single Malt Whisky - the hamper includes two tea and coffee treats, 18 pantry items, six fresh produce treats and five kitchen gifts, two of which are a set of cheese knives and a glass table dome to cover the cheese board with.

Other hampers, for those on a more 
diminutive budget, are also available from the department store, with 
The Opulence Hamper cashing in at £10,000 and The Harrodian Hamper at a 
meagre £2,500.

The £10,000 Opulence hamper contains 17 bottles of wine and spirits, plenty of cheese and crackers, Oscietra Caviar and Iberian chorizo

Other hampers from Harrods are moderately less lavish... but only moderately

Harrods' own-brand hampers are much more economically viable
