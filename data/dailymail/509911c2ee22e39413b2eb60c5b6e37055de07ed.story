David Wise, 52, is on trial at Marion Superior Court in Indianapolis for the alleged rape of his ex-wife

A mother-of-two has accused her ex-husband of drugging and raping her while she was passed out, then taking sordid videos of the attacks with his cellphone.

The 36-year-old woman, who has not been identified, testified on Monday against her former husband David Wise, 52, at Marion Superior Court in Indianapolis.Â 

She has accused Wise of drugging her several times during their 12-year marriage and once, she woke up with a pill dissolving in her mouth.

She told the jury that at times she woke up feeling like her body had been 'messed with', according to the Indianapolis Star.

The woman, who barely looked at Wise, said that there were times that she woke up not wearing any underwear but had no memory of taking it off.

She said that later she found three sex videos of herself on her husband's cellphone in 2008.

She said that she recognized her husband's hand with his wedding ring in the videos.

The couple divorced in 2009.

Wise is facing rape and criminal deviate charges. The videos of his alleged assaults will be shown to jurors as part of the trial.

The alleged rapes took place two-and-a-half years before the woman reported them to police. She said that she didn't report the attacks sooner because she didn't want her son and daughter to grow up without a father.

Defense attorney Elizabeth Milliken said that Wise's wife was 16 years younger than him and liked to drink and smoke marijuana, going out regularly with her friends.

Ms Milliken said that the jury should be skeptical of the authenticity of the videos.

The prosecution also plans to provide evidence of letters and emails that Wise wrote to his ex-wife, admitting to taking advantage of her.

The trial is expected to end this week.
