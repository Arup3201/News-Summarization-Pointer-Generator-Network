A boy aged just three took his family’s car for a drive and despite careering down two embankments ended up with only a bumped head.

The youngster started up the engine to the automatic Subaru Impreza and drove off down the family’s long driveway in Henley, near Midhurst, West Sussex.

But he did not stop there, motoring down two embankments before coming to a halt in the garden of a nearby pub.

Police who were called to the incident just before 8am yesterday said the unnamed youngster escaped with just a slight bump to his head.

He managed to avoid hitting any members of the public and is not believed to have been close to venturing on to any main roads.

A police spokesman said: ‘The boy unlocked the Subaru Impreza vehicle, which is an automatic, started it and drove it down the driveway, down two embankments and ended up in the garden of the Duke of Cumberland Arms pub.

‘He suffered a slight bump to the head after hitting it on the steering wheel. An ambulance was called and he was taken to hospital to be checked out.

‘No one else was hurt, although the car was damaged.’

A woman at the Duke of Cumberland Arms - crowned Pub of the Year in the 2012 Good Food Guide’s Editors’ Choice Awards - declined to comment on the boy's journey.

But she said the owners of the pub were away at the time of the incident.
