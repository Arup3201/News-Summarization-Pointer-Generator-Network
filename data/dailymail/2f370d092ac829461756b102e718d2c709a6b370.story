Free: Duncan Drye, 64, has been ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid community work after admitting breaching health and safety regulations

A fairground worker whose runaway horse and carriage crushed to death a blind grandmother has walked free from court.

Carole Bullett, 57, was thrown 6ft in the air by the 'spooked' animal in front of her horrified daughter and seven-year-old grandson at a country fair in June 2011.

The horse then trampled on Mrs Bullett, before crushing her chest under the wheels of the cart it was pulling.

Now, owner Duncan Drye, 64, has been ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid community work after admitting breaching health and safety regulations.

Eight other people were injured in the incident at Nowton Park Country Fair in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, Ipswich Crown Court heard.

The four-year-old horse, called Lucas, suddenly went out of control and ran straight into a crowd of spectactors - leaving scenes of carnage in its wake.

Witness Darryl Whitpen told an inquest in 2012 that there were 'a few seconds of total carnage with people scrabbling to get out of the way' of the horse.

Another bystander Jean Cramer said 
she watched helplessly as the animal charged towards Mrs Bullet, who was
 put on the blind register in 1992.

A
 statement by Elisabeth Haslam was also read to the jury, which 
described the crowds of people 'screaming' before the grandmother was 
'catapulted' into the air.

It read: 'The horse was running at full speed with the cart bouncing around behind it.

'Everyone was screaming, they were all trying to dive for cover.'

Mrs Bullet, from Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge following the incident, where she sadly died a day later.

During the inquest, pathologist Dr Dada said Mrs Bullett had received a number of fractures to her ribs and that blunt force trauma to the chest had been the cause of death.

However, the former dinner lady's death was ruled to be 'accidental'. 

Vets found 'no evidence of any clinical reason' for Lucas to have exhibited 'abnormal  behaviour', but the horse was put down in January this year after suffering from a worm infestation.

Yesterday, Drye admitted failing as an employer to ensure that visitors to the fair were not exposed to health and safety risks.

Sentencing Drye, Judge David Goodin described what had happened at the fair as a 'tragedy'.

He said there was no evidence Drye had committed the offence through greed, gross negligence or for financial gain.

However,
 he ruled the owner had been careless after failing to make sure the 
rides were separated from members of public at the fair.

He added that Drye had also allowed an inexperienced groom to do some of the carriage driving on the day of the incident.

'These are culpable failings, but not failings that warrant custody,' he said.

St Edmundsbury Borough Council, which organised the fair, was found not guilty of the same offence in November last year.
