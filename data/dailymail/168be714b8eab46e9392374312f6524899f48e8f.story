In the future astronauts on missions to distant worlds like Mars will print some of the tools they need and, maybe one day, even their food.

Now an important first step to realising that dream has  been achieved, as Nasa has made the first 3D-printed object in space.

Using a printer installed on the ISS earlier this month, the crew created a calibration object and will eventually use it to make useful items.

Astronauts on the ISS have printed the first 3D object in space (shown). They used a printer built by California-based company Made in Space. It was taken to the ISS in September by SpaceX's Dragon capsule. The demonstration is an important step to having 'replicators' on future missions

The device was created by California-based company Made in Space, who were contracted by Nasa to design it for the ISS.

Called the 3D Printing in Zero-G Technology Demonstration, it aims to show the 'additive manufacturing' technique can make 3D printed parts and tools in space.

The first object that has now been printed was a faceplate engraved with the names of Nasa and Made in Space written on it.

3D printers allow objects of any shape to be created from just a digital file.

They work in an extremely simple way, by building up a 3D object from layers of material.

Like a traditional inkjet printer, material, usually plastic, is laid down on a base.

Further layers are simply printed on top, gradually revealing a 3D object.

The technology is used in a huge range of industries from construction to aerospace.

Many believe it could even lead to 'mini factories' for living rooms 
allowing consumers to print anything they want - from a bracelet to a 
replacement part for a broken household appliance.  

The printer was installed on the station by astronaut Butch Wilmore, in the station's Microgravity Science Glovebox, which is used for conducting science and technology experiments.

The printer used plastic to form the first of a series of calibration coupons.

It works by heating a relatively low-temperature plastic filament to build parts layer by later in designs supplied to the machine.

The printer left Earth in September 2014 on SpaceX's fourth commercial resupply mission. 

About 20 objects will be printed in the next few weeks, and early next year they will be brought back to Earth by the Dragon capsule for analysis.

Nasa will study the objects to see how zero-gravity conditions affect the printing process, although from these early tests there seems to be few inhibitions, if any.

'When the first human fashioned a tool from a rock, it couldn't have been conceived that one day we'd be replicating the same fundamental idea in space,' Aaron Kemmer, CEO of Made in Space, said in a statement.

The device was created by California-based company Made in Space (shown on parabolic flight), who were contracted by Nasa to design it for the ISS. Called the 3D Printing in Zero-G Technology Demonstration, it aims to show the 'additive manufacturing' technique can make 3D printed parts and tools in space.

According to the company, the presence of a 3D printer on the ISS will allow hardware designs to be made on Earth and then digitally beamed to the space station.

Physical objects can then be made in a matter of hours.

'This printer is a critical first step for in-space manufacturing,' said Jason Crusan, director of Nasa's Advanced Exploration Systems Division at Nasa Headquarters in Washington.

'Additive manufacturing with 3-D printers will allow space crews to be less reliant on supply missions from Earth and lead to sustainable, self-reliant exploration missions where resupply is difficult and costly.

'The space station provides the optimal place to perfect this technology in microgravity.'

And Niki Wekheiser, Nasa's 3D printer project manager, added: 'The goal of the first phase of printing is to verify that the 3-D printing process works the same in microgravity as it does on the ground.

'Once we confirm that the process works, we will move to the second phase of printing which focuses more on the design and utilisation of the parts we print, which will ultimately lead to establishing an on-demand machine shop in space.'
