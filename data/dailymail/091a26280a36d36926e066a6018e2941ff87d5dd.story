Swaggering away from court: Lee Cairns, 43, and his daughter Kelly Lamb (pictured), 23, left a man aged 79 unconscious in an unprovoked attack

This is the shameless swagger of a father walking free from court despite knocking a 79-year-old man unconscious after his daughter attacked the victim's car.

Lee Cairns, 43, of Wallsend, Tyne and Wear, took a ‘running leap’ at Stan Roberts and punched him in the face in an unprovoked attack in nearby North Shields.

Mr Roberts, who suffered cuts to his nose and cheek and required treatment from an ambulance crew after the attack, said he had ‘never been punched so hard in my life’.

The attack happened last July at the home of his ex-wife, 38-year-old trainee nurse Yejide, North Tyneside Magistrates’ Court was told.

There had been an earlier clash between the couple and Cairns’s daughter Kelly Lamb, 23, a mother with a one-year-old child, which resulted in damage caused to Mrs Roberts’s car.

Minutes later, Cairns stormed to the home and attacked Mr Roberts, punching him once to the face with such force that it knocked him out.

When police arrived to arrest Cairns at his home, he snatched a baton from one officer and threatened to ‘take his head off’.

Cairns, who admitted assault, criminal damage and assaulting a police officer, will be sentenced later this month. Lamb admitted  criminal damage and was given an 18-month conditional discharge, as well as being fined more than £400 in compensation and costs.

Maimuna Bappa, prosecuting, said: ‘Mr Roberts was visiting his ex-wife at her property when they heard a loud knock on the door. He went to the door and found a young lady, identified as Kelly Lamb. She was asking for them to move their motor vehicle from outside their address.

‘After the verbal altercation, he did move the car. There was some aggression but, after they moved it, they sat down to watch TV. Twenty minutes later, some people came to the door again.’

Cairns hurled abuse at Mr and Mrs Roberts, before entering the house and attacking Mr Roberts.

Mr Bappa added: ‘He saw him draw his right fist back and punch him in the face. He was bleeding heavily from his face as a result and collapsed by the living room door.’

Cairns and Lamb each then kicked the door of Mrs Roberts’s car, leaving a dent. Mr Roberts was treated in hospital before he discharged himself.

He said: ‘He said he punched me once but he knocked me out, so I don’t actually know how many times I was hit.

‘Cairns saw me and took a running leap towards me and punched me so hard he split my nose and cheek. I went down and I was on the floor.

‘I’m 79 and not used to being bashed like that. I was knocked out then I was in a haze and all I could see was the floor and an increasing pool of red blood around me.’

The incident left Nigerian-born Mrs Roberts so terrified she was forced to leave her home.

She said: ‘It’s affected me so badly. I had to move house and I hardly ever leave the house now in case I bump into them in the street.

‘It has left me a nervous wreck and affected my career as a student nurse. I hope they get punished.’

Referring to the assault on the police officer, Ms Bappa said: ‘The officer went to arrest the defendant and he attempted to walk away.

Sentenced: Lamb was given an 18-month conditional discharge at North Tyneside Magistrates’ Court (above), as well as being fined more than £400 in compensation and costs. Cairns will be sentenced later this month

‘He became aggressive and, after he had one hand cuffed, he used his other hand to pull the baton from the officer’s belt and raised it above his head and threatened to hit the officer. 

'He said he would “take the officer’s head off” with the baton.’

Richard Haswell, defending Lamb, said: ‘She’s a young lady with a one-year-old child. She’s in work. She’s got involved and lost her temper and kicked the door.’

She was ordered to pay £255 compensation, £150 costs and a £15 victim surcharge.

Mr Haswell, also representing Cairns, said his case should be adjourned for the preparation of pre-sentence reports. District Judge Bernard Begley said: ‘This was a serious and nasty incident. An elderly man was injured.’
