Liverpool would have beaten Basle if Daniel Sturridge had been playing, according to Sportsmail columnist Jamie Redknapp.

Liverpool were eliminated from the Champions League by the Swiss champions on Tuesday night after a 1-1 draw at Anfield.

Basle progressed to the knockout stages at the expense of Brendan Rodgers' side, who finished third in Group B after managing just a single win in six Champions League matches.

But former Liverpool midfielder Redknapp believes the Reds would have got the win they needed to advance had crocked striker Sturridge, who is currently recovering from a thigh injury in the United States, been fit. 

'Where I do have sympathy for them is Daniel Sturridge. If Daniel Sturridge plays, Liverpool win that,' Redknapp said on Sky Sports.

And 41-year-old Redknapp said Liverpool's struggles this season are simply highlighting just how good former striker Luis Suarez is.

'The Suarez exit shows just how good that fella is, because he transcended that whole team and the club, and the players around him.

'When you look at them now, you think they're decent players, but with Suarez, they looked like world beaters. I think that's been the difference for them, they've lost him and Sturridge. 

'But the players who have come in have to do a lot better.'
