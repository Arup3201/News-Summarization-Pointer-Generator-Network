A young mother has written an open letter to a burglar who ransacked her family home telling them they are a ‘coward’ and wishing them ‘sadness’ and ‘misfortune’.

Mother-of-two Angie Sowton pinned the note to lampposts in her area so the criminal would know how hurt they had been by the break-in.

The letter comes days after another 16-year-old burglar wrote to his victim that he was ‘not bothered or sorry' after ransacking their property.

The teenager, who broke into a property in Moortown, Leeds, even hit out at the family for their ‘dumb mistakes’ in making their property a target for thieves.

But, following a raid on her south London home, Mrs Sowton, 34, has decided to hit back at the burglar in an open letter.

Her husband Chris, 34, returned home to discover the kitchen window had been broken and their south London property had been ransacked, the Daily Telegraph reported.

In the letter she wrote to the thief: ‘You saw the photographs of our childrens' innocent faces and were still able to steal from them. We will never understand the kind of person that makes you.’

Mrs Sowton, 33, was out at an art gallery with her daughters Olivia, three, and Amy, one, when the break-in happened.

Two Christening necklaces given to her children, a ring given by Mrs Sowton’s in-laws, an iPod and a laptop were stolen.

The thief also tore open Christmas presents and took a bottle of champagne from the fridge.

She addressed the letter to the ‘coward who burgled our home’.

Mrs Sowton, who used to work as a schoolteacher, added: ‘The few pounds you make from stealing ours and our childrens’ hard earned, beloved and sentimental possessions will bring you sadness, misfortune and the dark days you rightly deserve.

‘The love and sentiments attached to the items you took, you will never understand.

‘However our love and our children will bring us to terms with what you have done to our family and are everything  you are not and could never be.’

The letter was signed off ‘A hard working young family.’

Mrs Sowton told the Daily Telegraph that she felt better to have written the letter – so that the thief or thieves know what they have done.

She said: ‘It was a bit of therapy for myself and a hope that it might evoke a pang of guilt in them.

‘I want them to see it and I want them to know how much hurt they have caused. I want them to know it was personal. It wasn't just some anonymous possessions from an anonymous house.

‘We haven't got lots of money. All our money goes to pay the mortgage and most of the things that have gone were gifts.

The family are insured so will not be left out of pocket following the break-in.
