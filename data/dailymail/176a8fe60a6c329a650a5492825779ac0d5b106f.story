Lib Dem minister Jenny Willott said she avoids going to Prime Minister's Questions whenever she can

Lib Dem women's minister Jenny Willott today launched a stinging attack on Parliament and her own party for being too male-dominated and excluding women.

She declared she hates Prime Minister's Questions with a 'total passion' and warned the 'horrifically long' hours make it difficult to be a mother on British politics.

The Business Minister, who attends Cabinet on women's issues. also lifted the lid on the 'massive rows' she has had with senior Lib Dems about the failure elect more female MPs.

Commons Speaker John Bercow sparked controversy last month after claiming that women MPs have stopped attending Prime Minister’s Questions because of the rowdy atmosphere. 

Today Miss Willott said she backed Mr Bercow, and tries to avoid the weekly clash whenever possible.

She said: 'I think ultimately we do need to change the culture of this place, because... this is not an attractive job prospect if you are looking at it from the outside. 

'The hours are horrifically long, you get shedloads of abuse, you're dealing with the Chamber where if you watch PMQs - and I know the Speaker got a lot of criticism for saying women walk out and don’t enjoy participating.

'I hate PMQs with a total passion. I only sit in there if I absolutely have to. I absolutely hate it and it says an awful lot about the way the House operates that it is seems from the outside, not a particularly attractive prospect to go in.'

Miss Willott was speaking at the launch of the Asda Mumdex, which examined the views of 11,000 mothers who shop at the supermarket with a year until the general election.

It found half of mothers think a female MP would do a better job of representing their needs than a male MP, and 72 per cent think policies are focussed on men.

Miss Willott condemned the lack of women in politics, and singled out the Lib Dems for criticism.

She added: 'We need more women in politics. The number of MPs in parliament who are women is absolutely shocking. It’s massively male. And the number of those of us who have small kids is even smaller.'

She said she first stood for Parliament in 2001 and was 'very taken aback at how few women there were standing in seats that were winnable'.

'I have been having massive rows with my colleagues in the Liberal Democrats ever since about the need to do about getting more women standing for the party.

'There’s a massive lack of women standing and putting themselves forward and getting elected, to be honest in all parties.

'Labour has done much better than either the Liberal Democrats or the Conservatives, but still there’s a need for more women.'

Commons Speaker John Bercow claimed last month that women MPs were avoiding the weekly clashes between Ed Miliband (left) and David Cameron

Labour has 86 female MPs compared to 169 men, while the Tories have 48 women and 256 male MPs.

The Lib Dems have just seven female MPs out of a total of 57 and Nick Clegg has been criticised for having more men with knighthoods on his benches than women.

In an interview last month Mr Bercow said the culture in Parliament, particularly at PMQs, means many women are put off by the ‘histrionics and cacophony of noise’.

Mr Bercow suggested that ‘seasoned parliamentarians’ boycotted the frequently boisterous sessions out of embarrassment, while other women did not want to take part in the session because it was ‘so bad’.

He said: ‘I think it is a big deal. I think it is a real problem. A number of seasoned parliamentarians, who are not shrinking violets, not delicate creatures at all, are saying, “This is so bad that I am not going to take part, I am not going to come along, I feel embarrassed by it.

‘People with a lot to contribute are reluctant to engage because they think that the histrionics and cacophony of noise are so damaging as to cause them to look elsewhere.

'But I’m sorry if some of those people are lost to the chamber because they think, “I’m not going to take part in that atmosphere”.’

However, Tory defence minister Anna Soubry, who sits on the back row of the green benches among the ‘awkward squad’ of MPs, warned that Mr Bercow was perpetuating ‘old fashioned’ views of women by singling them out.
