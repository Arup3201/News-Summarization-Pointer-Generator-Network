Bailiffs found the body of a pensioner in his kitchen after he died in November 2010, with Classic FM still playing on his radio two years later.

Konstantinos Georgakopolos, originally from Greece, was found on September 26 last year in Chatham, Kent after neighbours thought he might have gone back to Greece.

The 75-year-old was only discovered when the bailiffs forced their way in to recover unpaid solicitors’ fees, an inquest heard.

Undiscovered: Konstantinos Georgakopolos was found in his house, pictured, in Kent two years after he died

On a table were his passport and unused plane tickets for November 14, 2010, while post was piled high at his door.

Kent Police Sergeant Michelle Burgess 
told the hearing: 'No valuables were found at all. He lived quite a poor
life really. There was tea and coffee in the main room, but no food 
items.'

Mr Georgakopolos was so decomposed that his body was only identified by comparing DNA found on his cigarette lighter to a scrap of his leg bone.

The police had visited the home but did not break down the door because they could not smell a body.

Recording an open verdict Mid Kent and Medway coroner Patricia Harding said the cause of death would remain a mystery because Mr Georgakopolos was so decomposed.

The inquest heard Mr Georgakopolos, who had a stroke in Greece before he returned to the UK, lived a basic existence.

Letting agent Maria Bruce, manager at the lettings next door, had a 'nagging feeling' that something was wrong so she spoke to neighbours. They thought he had gone away for a few days but had never come back.

Miss Bruce said: 'We’d known him for years and years, he was more than just a client. He was an eccentric, in a lovely way.'

'Nagging feeling': Neighbours on Mr Georgakopolos's road in Chatham called police to check the house but they did not look inside

'He once had a little rhyme to tell me how to remember his phone number. If you went over to his house, you knew it wouldn’t be a little five-minute visit. You could be there for hours.

'He didn’t look 75 - he looked about 50. He was a very good man. He split his time between his home here and in Greece.

'He had his shop in Greece. I think he ran it with his niece, so I’m not sure why they didn’t raise the alarm over there. The whole thing is unbelievable.'

Miss Bruce said she helped find the family, making repeated calls to the Greek embassy. She today added: 'We must be the only people who raised the alarm.

'The problem was because he spent half his time in Greece, I thought something must have happened to him there.'

'It’s so sad that someone was gone for two years. I kept thinking, oh my gosh, that’s two Christmases.'

No family attended the inquest.
