A television weatherman was left unable to speak on air after he was reduced to a flood of giggles by his colleague's joke on the morning news show.

Joe Crain was laughing so hard he walked off camera and crouched on the floor when newsreader Natalie Sparacio recounted the story of a Russian woman who had 69 children.

When the anchor quipped, 'She's got quite the uterus,' Mr Crain dissolved into laughter and could not deliver the weather forecast.

Banter: Natalie Sparacio, left, and Joe Crain, right, joked about a woman with 69 children on WICS

The hilarious blunder came during the 'Sunrise This Morning' segment on WICS, the local ABC affiliate in Springfield, Illinois, around 6.30 yesterday morning.

The two presenters swapped jokes and banter as Ms Sparacio was preparing to deliver a quirky historical anecdote for the benefit of early-morning viewers.

She claimed that a woman living in Russia during the 17th century had given birth to 69 children - four sets of quadruplets, seven lots of triplets and 16 pairs of twins.

Mr Crain compared the fertile mother to the story of the old woman who lived in a shoe, while Ms Sparacio commented, 'How is that even possible? It's crazy.'

Laughter: Mr Crain was unable to present the weather forecast because he was giggling so much

When the weatherman chuckled and joked, 'Let's leave it at that,' the newsreader concluded: 'She's got quite the uterus, we'll just say that much.'

As the camera then cut to a map of the state, a shriek of laughter could be heard, and Mr Crain walked on camera saying, 'I can't believe you just said that.'

He tried to deliver the weather forecast, but was unable to get out more than a few phrases through his giggles.

On the floor: Eventually the weatherman was squatting on the ground as he continued laughing

At one point he added, 'That's what her husband said,' and fell to his haunches, unable to stop laughing.

Mr Crain finally said: 'We've got to get serious because we've got the news to do... Natalie!'

Ms Sparacio appeared far more composed when the camera cut back to her, saying: 'Oh my. All right. We've got some serious news to talk about this morning.'
