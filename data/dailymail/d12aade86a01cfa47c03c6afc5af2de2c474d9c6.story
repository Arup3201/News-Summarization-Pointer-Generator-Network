Ferrari announced the departure of their president Luca di Montezemolo, marking the end of a glorious but faded era.

In two spells, Di Montezemolo won 19 world titles, the last of them the constructors’ championship in 2008. But the wait for fresh glory — and the politics of Ferrari — cost him the job he carried off with conspicuous urbanity for 23 years.

The 67-year-old will officially leave with an eye-watering £23million pay-off on October 13 to be replaced by Fiat chief executive Sergio Marchionne, who seems to have forced Di Montezemolo’s exit primarily because they disagreed over the direction of the business.

While the Ferrari road car is delivering record profits, the Formula One team again needs precisely the kind of major surgery that Di Montezemolo specialised in.

For too long, Fernando Alonso’s consistent and fabulous driving has masked the essential limitations of their cars. This year’s engine is deficient in comparison with that of Mercedes. That was especially disappointing because the major change to hybrid power offered them a chance to turn the corner.

Poor results have led to flux within the team. Stefano Domenicali left as principal in April. His record was mixed rather than terrible. He led Ferrari to the last of Di Montezemolo’s titles.

But, as Di Montezemolo noted as long ago as 1992, Ferrari carries with it ‘the burden of false assumption, a public belief that we should win because we have so much money.’

On Domenicali’s departure, high-flying Ferrari executive Marco Mattiacci was parachuted in from car sales in America. The competent way he has gone about his work has belatedly answered some of the early doubts, but he is still a greenhorn.

After Di Montezemolo’s departure was announced, Mattiacci and Marchionne met at the team’s Maranello factory. Afterwards, a spokesman dismissed the pair’s combined lack of pit-lane experience, saying: ‘There are many experienced people at Ferrari — the people here are our strength.

‘Mr Marchionne’s chairmanship has galvanised the clear, common objective to get back to the top.’ 

Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone paid tribute to one of his oldest friends and adversaries, saying: ‘His leaving is, for me, the same as Mr Enzo dying. He has become Ferrari. You see him, you see Ferrari. You don’t see anything else. You don’t see Luca.’

How? It is possible they will entice Ross Brawn, their legendary technical leader, out of a sabbatical-cum-retirement, but will he be willing to return to such a fierce glare while in his 60th year and with millions in the bank?

Perhaps they don’t need him. Mattiacci, who talked before Di Montezemolo’s departure of needing to ‘turn the page culturally’, is a big supporter of James Allison, the 46-year-old technical director, an Englishman and putatively the new Brawn.

Next year Ferrari are likely to retain this season’s driver line-up — a Latin in Fernando Alonso and a Finn in Kimi Raikkonen. Indeed, Alonso is unlikely to be upset by the news after Di Montezemolo upbraided him last year for making ‘rash statements’.

Some of Di Montezemolo’s theatrics looked hackneyed by the end and his semi-detached management style possibly acted as a brake on progress. But he undoubtedly fought hard for Ferrari since, as a 20-something Piedmont aristocrat, he became a protégé of the ‘Old Man’ Enzo Ferrari.

A law graduate, Di Montezemolo began as Enzo’s assistant in 1973, taking over as the Scuderia’s manager the following year. In that stint, he won three constructors’ titles and, through his signing of Niki Lauda, two drivers’ championships.

He took up various posts at the parent company Fiat before organising Italia 90. That World Cup ran like clockwork, and so hard did Di Montezemolo work that his weight plummeted from a slim 11st to a skeletal 8st.

He was called back by Fiat boss Gianni Agnelli in 1991 to shake up Ferrari, which was then shorn of success on the track and deep in debt off it.

He produced huge profits and laid the groundwork for unprecedented Formula One success by bringing in the perfectionist team boss Jean Todt, Brawn star designer Rory Byrne and, to cap it all, Michael Schumacher.

More recently he formed FOTA, the teams’ association, which brought an end to Max Mosley’s reign as FIA president. After the meeting in Paris, he stood on Mosley’s office balcony at Place de la Concorde, two friends and enemies of 40 years, looking down at where the revolutionary guillotine once stood.

The coup, it seems, happened because Di Montezemolo and Marchionne could not co-exist within Fiat, which is soon to be floated on the stock exchange.

Last Sunday’s dismal result at the Italian Grand Prix — two points — was the final cut for Ferrari’s own Sun King.
