The US Air Force is facing an investigation over why it destroyed 16 cargo planes worth nearly $500million and turned them into $32,000 of scrap metal.

The fleet of 16 C-27As that were bought for the Afghan Army and stored in Kabul International Airport were taken apart to allegedly save costs as forces continue to withdraw from the country. 

It has prompted  an investigation by John Sopko, special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, who will question why there wasn't an effort to 'salvage' taxpayers' money.

Scrapped: The US Air Force now faces a probe as to why the planes, which cost $500million were turned into $32,000 of scrap metal. They will also be asked why the money wasn't 'salvaged' 

He asked Air Force Secretary Deborah James to
document all decisions made about the destruction of the aircraft.

'I am concerned that the officials responsible for planning
and executing the scrapping of the planes may not have
considered other possible alternatives in order to salvage
taxpayer dollars,' he said.

Sopko also asked if any other parts of the planes had been
sold before they were destroyed by the Defense Logistics Agency.

Sopko's office has been investigating the matter since
December 2013 after numerous non-profit groups and military
officials raised questions about funds wasted on the planes.

The U.S. government spent $486 million to buy and refurbish
20 older C-27A airplanes from Alenia, a unit of Italy's
Finmeccanica SpA, but later canceled the program
because a lack of spare parts was severely limiting their
availability for military use.Base:

Questions: In an interview last year John Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, said it wasunclear if the move to take apart the planes was criminal fraud or mismanagement

Instead, the Pentagon decided to buy four larger C-130
planes built by Lockheed Martin Corp to do the work.

Pentagon spokesman Major Brad Avots said the U.S. military
decided to destroy the planes 'to minimize impact on drawdown of
U.S. forces in Afghanistan,' but would provide more information
after a review.

Avots said the Pentagon and Air Force would consider various
options for the remaining four planes, including possible sale
to other parties.

'Working in a wartime environment such as Afghanistan brings
with it many challenges, and we continually seek to improve our
processes,' he said.

Under used: In January 2013, the Pentagon's inspector general office said the aircraft flew only 234 of the 4,500 required hours fromJanuary through September 2012

He said the U.S. military was also working to help
Afghanistan 'improve accountability and help instill sound
financial management practices in daily operations while
reducing the risk of fraud, waste and abuse.'

In an interview last year with NBC News, Sopko said it was
unclear if the incident was criminal fraud or mismanagement, but
the waste was not an isolated incident in Afghanistan.

The Pentagon's inspector general has also investigated the
issue, which the non-profit Project on Government Oversight
calls 'a shining example of the billions wasted in Afghanistan.'

In January 2013, the Pentagon's inspector general office
said the aircraft flew only 234 of the 4,500 required hours from
January through September 2012. The office also said about $200
million were needed to buy spare parts for the planes.
