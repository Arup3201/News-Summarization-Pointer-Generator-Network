Chipotle is rolling out organic tofu on menus across the country, the Mexican restaurant chain has announced.

The meatless protein, which has been tested in some branches for a year, can now be added to make vegan and vegetarian burritos, tacos, bowls and salads.

Named Sofritas, it is made with chipotle chilis, roasted poblanos and spices. The tofu will be sold at the same price as Chipotle chicken - which makes it around $6.50 in a burrito.

Chipotle is rolling out their organic tofu called Sofritas in restaurants across the country where it will be available in burritos, tacos and bowls

The new product, said to mimic the taste of chorizo, is lower in calories than meaty fillings.

A sofritas burrito with brown rice and no accompaniments is 645 calories compared a chicken version at 680, steak at 690 calories and pork at 720.

The shredded tofu is already on the menu at Chipotles in San Francisco, Baltimore and Philadelphia.

A single burrito (flour tortilla with meat or tofu, healthy brown rice no accompaniments):

Tofu - 645 caloriesChicken - 680 caloriesSteak - 690 caloriesBarbacoa (spicy beef) - 665 caloriesCarnitas (seasoned pork) - 720 calories

From March 3, it will be available in New York City and Boston before rolling out across the U.S.

The tofu is being made with producer Hodo Soy in Oakland, California. The product is GMO-free and organic. 

Chipotle promotes a 'food with integrity' message and supports sustainable farming, local businesses and organic produce. 

Although plenty of major fast-food 
restaurants have vegetarian and vegan options on the menu, Chipotle 
appears to be the first nationwide chain to offer tofu.  

Last
 month, Chipotle paid $1million for a four-episode series 'Farmed and 
Dangerous' on Hulu, which promised to be a satirical take on industrial 
farming.
