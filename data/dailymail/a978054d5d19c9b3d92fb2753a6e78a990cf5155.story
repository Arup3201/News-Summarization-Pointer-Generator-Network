This is the touching moment a hundred strangers embraced a blindfolded Aboriginal woman on the middle of a popular beach.

As part of a social experiment, Western Australian teenager Jasirah Bin-Hitam headed to Cottesloe Beach in Perth blindfolded with a sign that read: 'I trust you. Do you trust me? Let's hug.'

The heart-warming video, uploaded yesterday by artist Peter Sharp, is intended to encourage Australian's to be more trusting.

Western Australian teenager Jasirah Bin-Hitam is seen standing in the middle of Cottesloe Beach in Perth blindfolded with the simple sign

It begins with the 17-year-old Marine Biology student opening her arms and setting up the sign.

While the crowd are initially dubious, they're soon swooping in for a warm embrace, telling Hitlam she is 'very brave' and 'bloody amazing darling.'

After a sequence of heart-rending hugs, the video finishes with a concerning statistic from the Australian Reconiliation Barometer:

'In 2012, only 13 per cent of Australians said they trusted an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander.'

Ms Bin Hitam told Seven News she hopes the video, which shows several 100 strangers offer her a hug in a half an hour, can help change that statistic.

'It was really emotional for me, having random people come up and hug me,' she said.

Peter Sharp, who created the video, said it is intended to change  people's conceptions about trust

Peter Sharp was propelled into the spotlight last month with a video of a spontaneous dance party on a Perth train, which garnered over 10 million views.

He told Seven News the video is intended to change people's conceptions.

'We are just human beings who want to make a difference and it can be as simple as standing there with a sign,' he said. 

The video was uploaded on Thursday and has already been viewed by more than 160,000 people.
