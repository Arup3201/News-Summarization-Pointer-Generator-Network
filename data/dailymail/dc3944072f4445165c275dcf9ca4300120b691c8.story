For 12 months after police officers from the Democratic Republic of Congo 'summarily executed' at least nine people, including a child, Britain continued to fund them.

But just two weeks after the police brutality scandal the first public reports on it were already available. That was on November 15.

During the police offensive, named 'Operation Punch', a further 32 men and boys disappeared in the capital, Kinshasa. Two 16-year-olds are amongst 29 of this group who are still unaccounted for.

For 12 months after police officers from the Democratic Republic of Congo 'summarily executed' at least nine people, including a child, Britain continued to fund them

And on November 27 the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) and the UN peacekeeping mission in Congo issued a joint statement further highlighting the issue, sighting 'reports of disappearance and assassination of young men and children in some communes of Kinshasa'.

According to The Telegraph, at that time, the UN agencies said that about 20 people, including 12 children, had been killed. They urged 'immediate steps' to 'put an end to such acts'.

Despite these declarations of concern, the Department for International Development (Dfid) continued to fund Congo's police for almost another year.

And it wasn't until this month that they finally suspended their payments to its 'Security Sector Accountability and Police Reform Programme'. It did so following a UN report in October which confirmed nine deaths and numerous other violations during Operation Punch. 

Between 2008 and 2014 Difid had promised £67million to improve the 'capability and accountability' of the Congolese National Police. By the time it pulled the pin on the programme Difid had already spent £55million.

Justifying the continued payments a Difid spokesperson told the newspaper: 'We were aware of reports of human rights violations and raised them regularly at the highest level of the Congolese Government while the UN conducted their investigations. We wanted to make sure that any action followed the outcome of the UN investigation.'

The Department for International Development only stopped their payments to the police this month after the UN released their final report in October which confirmed they were responsible for nine deaths

The spokesperson added that they made a 'swift decision' to end the payments following the UN's final report. 

That report found that nine people were executed during Operation Punch and 32 'forcibly disappeared'. The operation was meant to be targeting organised crime. 

The report went on to say they believe the number of victims could be 'much higher'. 

And said the operation involved masked and hooded policemen travelling in unmarked vehicles after dark, before waiting outside the homes of their victims. 

On November 19, a shopkeeper, 30, was shot dead outside his home by hooded men in police uniforms. 

On November 23, a 18-year-old was picked up while trying to earn money cleaning cars. After being driven around for a number of hours the teenager was shot three times in the back.

The youngest victim was a 17-year-old who was shot in the back outside his home on November 27. 

Of the 32 who disappeared, there were able to buy their freedom from police custody. One of which is a 16-year-old who was tied up and taken from his home to a nearby police station.  

 Dfid's budget rose by 32 per cent between 2012 and 2013 – the biggest annual jump by a Whitehall department in peacetime history. Critics say the pressure to spend its budget makes it harder for the organisation to cut payments.
