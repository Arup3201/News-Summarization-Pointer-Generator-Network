A five-year-old girl who was told she may never be able to walk or even crawl due to a rare chromosome disorder has proved doctors wrong by running for the first time unaided.

Eden Nagle's mother, Michelle, 32, shows in a short film titled Don't Give Up how the brave youngster from Idaho overcame her bleak diagnosis through physical therapy sessions and lots of determination.

At the beginning of the film Eden is seen on a treadmill wearing leg braces, then on Christmas morning, aged two, she appears crawling. Eventually at the end, after a few wobbles and falls, she ecstatically jogs outside in sneakers.

Super girl! Five-year-old Eden Nagle was told she may never be able to walk or even crawl due to a rare chromosome disorder - but she has proved doctors wrong by standing on her own two feet unaided

In another shot uploaded to Mrs 
Nagle's Facebook page, Eden appears wearing a Supergirl costume, 
defiantly standing up with one arm punching the air.

Her mother writes: 'She has no idea how appropriate this costume really is. Love this girl (my real life super hero).'

Mrs Nagle and her husband Tim, 36, first realized something was wrong with Eden around five to six 
months after her birth, when she wasn't trying to sit and crawl, and she
 had difficulty keeping her head up.

One step at a time: Eden Nagle's mother, Michelle, shows in a short film how the brave youngster from Idaho overcame her bleak diagnosis through physical therapy sessions and lots of determination

One the move: On Christmas morning, aged two, Eden crawls for the first time

'We also noticed that she wasn't 
really interested in toys and seemed to have a hard time seeing things. 
Her eyes seemed to be crossing quite a bit,' Mrs Nagle told MailOnline.

Doctors said that the infant had low muscle tone, but unable to give a diagnosis they directed the family to a genetic testing lab.

'Eden fell often but would always smile, get back up and try again. She
 is our hero and the beautiful reminder to never give up'

It was there that specialists
 noticed Eden had a deletion in her first chromosome, which could cause 
some developmental delays. They said that she may never be able to walk.

She was also diagnosed with Duane syndrome, a rare, congenital eye movement disorder, which means she doesn't have peripheral vision.

When Eden was eight months old she started physical therapy and took many sessions in the water.

She was later fitted with braces on her feet that went up to her ankles, allowing her to work with a reverse walker.

Now, five years on she is able to walk and even run without a walker. Her mother says that balance is still a struggle and uneven surfaces or stairs are most difficult.

Mrs Nagle lost her first daughter, Lyla, 23 minutes after her birth in 2007, because of a condition called anencephaly which meant she was missing the majority of her brain and skull.

Eden 
was born a year later. Asked if she would like more children Mrs Nagle 
said: 'Possibly. We have talked about this a number of times and haven't
 said yes or no.

'It's hard
 to know how things will develop as Eden gets older. We've talked about 
possibly adopting, but we are waiting to see how life unfolds.'

Strong-willed: When specialists first discovered
 Eden had a deletion in her first chromosome, they said she might never 
be able to walk

Warning signs: It wasn't until Eden was around five or six months old that the Nagles realized that something was wrong and doctors directed them to a genetic testing lab

Luckily the family have been eligible for Medicaid, which has helped fund Eden's treatment. Along with physical therapy she has also needed training to help with her speech.

Mrs Nagle concludes in the Vimeo film: 'Eden fell often but would always smile, get back up and try again.

'She is our hero and the beautiful reminder to find joy in the little things, love others, laugh often, be strong and never give up.

'We hope that Eden can encourage you that whatever your struggle might be... keep going, smile, you are loved, you are not alone, don't give up.'
