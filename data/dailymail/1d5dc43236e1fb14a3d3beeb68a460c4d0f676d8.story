Schools are boosting GCSE results by forcing children to sit the same exam as many as seven times, a government investigation has found.

Growing numbers of schools are entering pupils for a series of different tests in English and maths but only recording their best score so as to hike their positions in league tables.

In many cases, children are taking exams up to two years early and then sitting them again after failing to get good scores at the first attempt.

Schools are trying to manipulate exam performance tables by making pupils sit the same exams up to seven times, a Department for Education investigation has revealed (file picture)

But the Department for Education found some schools are going to even more extreme measures to improve their performance, including allowing children to sit the same subject with different examination boards in the same year to maximise their chances of doing well.

It has also emerged the number of pupils sitting both GCSEs and International GCSEs - and alternative version of the qualification designed for schools overseas - has risen 10-fold in 12 months, with 5,700 pupils taking maths in both versions in 2012 - up from 600 the previous year.

The DfE warned 'continually sitting examinations' was harmful to children's education.

It also emerged 400 pupils took maths exams at least seven times in 2012, a fourfold rise in 12 months.

The DfE has pledged to halt the process by reforming school league tables and moving towards end-of-course exams.

A spokesman said in the Daily Telegraph: 'We are increasingly concerned about this.

Education secretary Michael Gove has demanded a clampdown on the practice

'The evidence shows entering exams early, and then resitting, or sitting another exam in the same subject, is not good for pupils.

'The changes we have made to GCSEs and reforms to the accountability system will help address this. We are considering further action to discourage this practice.'

The cross-party Commons education committee published a report last year that criticised the extent to which the exams system skewed pupils' education.

As part of the report, MPs asked the DfE to investigate the problem of multiple exam entry and what action was needed to limit the practice.

This week, officials published new research into the issue.

Seven per cent of pupils sat GCSEs in English more than once in 2012, down from 25 per cent a year earlier.

In maths, the numbers were as high as 41 per cent, compared with 28 per cent the previous year.

Some 4,500 pupils sat maths exams five times in 2012, up from 800 in 2011. A further 400 took exams in the subject at least seven times, a significant increase on the 100 pupils doing so a year before.

The DfE report stated many cases involved children who took 'different specifications' - test papers in the same subject drawn up by different exam boards.

It added: 'Of the 63,800 pupils who took maths three times in 2012, 50,000 - 78 per cent - included more than one specification in their entries.

'The use of multiple specifications in mathematics in 2012 represented a significant increase when compared to 2011 (when it accounted for only 14 per cent).'
