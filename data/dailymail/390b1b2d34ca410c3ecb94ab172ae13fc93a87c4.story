Compensation: April Hall, 24, from Bradford, West Yorkshire, had a normal pregnancy with her first child Ethan, carrying him to full-term - but he was born stillborn after an error by midwives

The mother of a baby boy who was delivered stillborn after midwives missed signs that his heart was beating too slowly has spoken of her heartbreak in the hope no other parent will go through the same ordeal.

April Hall, 24, from Bradford, West Yorkshire, had a normal pregnancy with her first child Ethan, carrying him to full-term.

But during labour, two midwives at the Bradford Royal Infirmary failed to notice that her baby son had a fatal condition, bradycardia.

It meant Ethan had an unusually slow heart rate and was delivered stillborn.

Now the mother-of-two has been given an undisclosed amount of compensation by The Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust after it made an admission of liability.

Miss
 Hall's lawyers started legal action against the trust alleging that, if
 the condition had been detected, Ethan could have been given a quicker 
delivery.

The lawyers said it would have meant Ethan could have been resuscitated 15 minutes earlier, increasing his chance of survival. 

Miss Hall said: 'It breaks my heart to know that if 
Ethan’s slow heart rate had been detected during my labour, the midwives
 could have delivered him quickly and I would have him here with me now.

'I
 have really struggled to come to terms with what happened and I hope 
that through what happened with Ethan that all of the maternity staff at
 the hospital have had additional training to ensure that lessons can be
 learned.'

Throughout her labour, Miss Hall was 
monitored by a trainee midwife and a supervisor. But medical records 
show Ethan’s heart rate was not taken after 10.45am, half an hour before
 he was born.

When Ethan was born, staff began to resuscitate him but he could not be saved. 

Miss Hall said: 'I had no problems throughout my pregnancy.

'Whilst I was at the hospital during labour, I felt that the midwives were not monitoring me and Ethan as they should have been doing, but I thought I have to put my trust in the hospital staff to take care of me and my baby.

'When I finally delivered Ethan, I immediately noticed he didn’t cry or make any sound at all. I kept asking the midwives what was wrong with him as they rubbed his chest to stimulate his breathing.

'Suddenly the crash team arrived and they tried to revive him in front of me and my dad. I was in pieces. I just wanted to be able to hold my newborn son.

'Nothing could bring Ethan back or begin to make up for what happened but knowing that everything possible has been done to prevent another baby from dying might mean we can finally lay him to rest and try to begin the long process of rebuilding our lives.'

After his death, Miss Hall continued to visit the hospital to see her son until he was taken for a post-mortem.

She
 took photographs with her son that she now treasures in a family photo album.

The post mortem revealed her little boy’s heart 
rate had slowed down half-an-hour before she gave birth.

Miss Hall said: 'I had gone into labour the evening before and was pacing up and down at home.

'I
 first went into hospital at 4am but was sent home because I wasn’t 
dilated enough. I went back in at 6am and stayed there after progressing
 further into labour.'

She added: 'When
 he was delivered, it was a odd because my baby wasn’t passed to me, he 
was placed on the bed between my knees and the midwife walked out of the
 room.

'At first I smiled and was happy to have a baby boy but I then I realised he was not breathing. I
 started screaming that he wasn’t breathing and the trainee hit the 
button to call for the crash team, who immediately rushed into the 
room.'

Miss Hall, who now has children Sapphire, two, and Dalton James, nine weeks, started legal action in an attempt to move on with her life.

April’s lawyers at Irwin Mitchell took the case again the trust, alleging that staff failed to pick up Ethan's slow heart rate, a sign that the foetus is in distress and struggling.

Lawyers suggested that, if the midwives had picked up Ethan’s slow heart rate, they would have performed an assisted delivery, meaning Ethan would have been born sooner.

The lawyers added that the heart rate readings were taken by the trainee midwife and did not appear to have been checked by the supervising midwife.

The final allegation was that the supervising midwife had not undergone the necessary training to supervise a trainee midwife

Margaret Ryan, a specialist medical lawyer at Irwin Mitchell’s Leeds office, said: 'This is a tragic case that has seen April absolutely devastated by the loss of her son Ethan and she understandably wants answers about what went wrong.

'April has found it incredibly hard to accept what happened and has needed extensive support to help her come to terms with her loss.

'What is clear is that the midwives made a number of errors and failed to detect basic signs which would have showed them things weren’t right and ultimately led to Ethan being stillborn.

'It is difficult for the family to come to terms with the fact his death could have been avoided.

'We welcome the fact the trust has admitted responsibility and we back April’s calls to see that the trust has made improvements to maternity services to protect patient safety.

'We have assisted her reporting the substandard care to the nursing and midwifery council and we hope that their investigation will highlight the hospitals failings and ensure appropriate measures are put in place to stop this happening again.'

Miss Hall now hopes lessons will be learned from what happened to her.

She said: 'I knew I was right. I knew something had gone wrong. But it 
hurts because what I should have is a three-year-old boy with me today.

'But no matter what I do, nothing can ever get me that back.'

According to the Bradford Telegraph and Argus,
 the trust, which runs BRI, admitted 'on the balance of 
probability' that Ethan's bradycardia was missed during the birth.

Chief Nurse Juliette Greenwood, for Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'We would like to reiterate our sincere condolences to Ms Hall on the tragic loss of her son, Ethan.

'The Foundation Trust takes the safety of its patients very seriously and we launched an immediate and thorough investigation into Ethan’s stillbirth; a copy of which was shared with Ms Hall.

'Although staff did everything that was expected of them, in keeping with nationally accepted practice, we appreciate that this was a very sad and unexpected outcome for Ms Hall.

'All through this process we have openly answered any questions that Ms Hall asked in the wake of Ethan’s death and we have offered her our support to deal with her very sad bereavement.'
