A cafe manager who displayed five bagels in the style of Olympics rings was stunned to be raided by ‘community wardens’ from the council.

They took it upon themselves to declare the light-hearted window display ‘unauthorised’, and threatened him with court.

They proclaimed it a breach of laws brought in to prevent businesses exploiting the 2012 Games unless they are official sponsors.

O-no: Ring-shaped bagels at the House cafe in Camberwell, south London was told to take down the Olympic-themed display by southwark Borough Council

Pride: The bagels were put up ahead of the Olympic torch relay

Despite no one from the Olympics, the Government or any official sponsors complaining about the display of bread, the cafe had the book thrown at it by Southwark Council in South London.

Two ‘community wardens’ swooped on the House Cafe and Gallery, in Camberwell, within 20 minutes of manager David Adams putting up the display.

They claimed that putting the circular buns on show breached copyright rules.

One customer said: ‘They were being quite aggressive to David, ordering him to take them down immediately and threatening him with court and fines. They said there would be very serious consequences if he did not obey them.

‘It was just some bread hanging in a window, for goodness sake! When a few customers such as myself started telling them off for being silly, they began taking pictures of us on their camera, which I found sinister.

‘If Pippa Middleton can get away with blatantly cashing in on the Olympics, it’s ridiculous to punish a small cafe like this.’

Forbidden: A cake with an Olympic Ring design that Games organisers frowns upon

The Duchess of Cambridge’s family 
business, Party Pieces, is advertising on its website a huge range of 
goods under the headline Celebrate The Games.

It potentially breaches stringent 
regulations brought in by Locog, the London 2012 organising committee, 
which bans businesses from using words such as Games, Two Thousand and 
Twelve, and using the Olympics five-rings logo.

At the House Cafe, which
 is run as a not-for-profit charity, Mr Adams, 24, said: ‘We put the 
bagels up in the window to celebrate the Olympics and the fact the cafe 
is on the torch route.

‘These officials came in and told us to take them down. I was quite shocked.’

Another customer, Evan Jones, said: ‘I
 got really cross.

'I told them it was an appalling waste of money. Is 
there so little to do that we are asking people to cut down bagels now?’

Southwark’s 43-strong army of 
‘community wardens’ – which costs local taxpayers in excess of £1million
 a year – has the task of ‘reducing environmental crime, reducing crime 
and antisocial behaviour and building links in the community’.

In the light of the backlash, council chiefs have apologised to Mr Adams.

Two months ago, a florist in Stoke was ordered to take down Olympic rings made from paper tissue.

And a butcher in Weymouth, Dorset, was also told to remove five rings made from sausages.

The Celebrate the Games activity sets include a 
£2.49 ring toss game and £1.99 paper chains in the Olympic colours of 
red, yellow, green, blue and black
