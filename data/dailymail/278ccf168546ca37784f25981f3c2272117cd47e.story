British Airways could be facing another union battle as cabin crew staff attempt to establish who wears the trousers.

The British Airlines Stewards and Stewardesses Association is said to be ready to challenge BA over rules which mean new female recruits must wear skirts with no option of trousers.

Female crew members have been allowed to wear trousers on BA flights since 2004 - but now it seems that decision has been reversed.

All new female employees joining the airline’s Mixed Fleet – which makes up 2,000 of the 15,000 cabin staff – are required to wear skirts.

And, according to The Guardian, some crew members have asked their union, which is part of Unite, to raise the issue with BA.

Unite has previously challenged BA over the conditions this group work in, with lower salaries and different terms and conditions to other staff.

The union branch’s discussions with BA have in the past been led by Unite’s general secretary Len McCluskey.

The branch is now reportedly planning to conduct an online survey of its female members who work in the Mixed Fleet to decide whether further action will be taken.

According to the paper, union representatives had ‘tentatively raised’ the issue with BA management but were told it was the airline’s intention for women not to wear trousers.

All female BA cabin crew staff had the option to wear trousers while working between 2004, when a new uniform was designed by Julien McDonald, and 2010.

From 2010, women joining the newly-established Mixed Fleet have been required to wear skirts.

In 2004, the airline reportedly found that 70 per cent of female staff wanted to have a choice.

The BA uniform trousers are said to be made up of 80 per cent wool and 20 per cent polyester and can be a more practical option than skirts.

A British Airways spokesman said it had not received any complaints from Mixed Fleet staff since it was established in 2010.

'Our
 newest cabin crew fleet has always had its own uniform since its 
creation in 2010, with a number of unique aspects, such as female crew 
wearing a hat and skirt,' they said.

'This is the uniform offered to new members of 
cabin crew who are fully aware of this when they join the fleet.

'We believe our crew look professional and smart and we receive positive customer feedback on a regular basis.'
