West Ham have signed of defender Aaron Cresswell from Ipswich on a five-year contract.

The 24-year-old left-back joins the Hammers as manager Sam Allardyce looks to further boost his defensive options, with a move for Norwich's Martin Olsson now believed to be dead in the water.

A statement issued through West Ham's official Twitter account: 'We are delighted to announce the signing of highly-rated left-back Aaron Cresswell on a five-year deal from Ipswich Town.'

Hammer time! Ipswich defender Aaron Cresswell has moved to West Ham and signed a five-year contract

Highly rated: Cresswell had been attracting interest from several Premier League clubs

Cresswell impressed in recent years at 
Portman Road, missing just four league games over the course of the last
 two seasons for the Sky Bet Championship club.

Having started 
his career at Tranmere, Cresswell moved to Ipswich in 2011 and after 
completing his move to West Ham he will experience Barclays Premier 
League football for the first time in his career.

The news comes 
on the day West Ham's current crop returned for pre-season training, 
where Allardyce posed for pictures with his two summer recruits to date -
 striker Mauro Zarate and defensive midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate.

Having
 finished 13th in the league last season, Allardyce has been assured of 
his position by club owners David Sullivan and David Gold after a 
minority of Hammers fans began to vent their frustrations at the 
perceived negative tactics of the former Bolton and Newcastle boss.

With
 14 clean sheets in the Premier League, West Ham's survival was based on
 a sound defensive unit but Allardyce has been keen to add to his 
numbers at the back, with Cresswell becoming his third addition ahead of
 the forthcoming campaign.

Recognition: Cresswell was named in the Championship Team of the Year last season
