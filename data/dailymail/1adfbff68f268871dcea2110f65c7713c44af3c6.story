Alastair Cook will never have a better chance of scoring the century that eludes him but on another day of English domination the captain again fell short of the landmark that would complete his recovery from the darkest days of his career.

When India shelled two dollies to reprieve Cook on the second day of the final Test it seemed certain the cricketing gods had decided The Kia Oval was a worthy stage for Cook to finally silence any remaining doubts about his form.

So close: England captain Alastair Cook missed out on an elusive century despite two reprieves

He had, after all, received a huge let off on the first evening when Australian umpire Paul Reiffel decided that what looked a plumb lbw shout from Bhuvneshwar Kumar had pitched outside Cook’s leg stump. It had not.

Then when Murali Vijay and Ajinkya Rahane dropped two of the easiest slip catches you will see when Cook was on 65 and 70 India were looking like an absolute rabble and the England captain was enjoying a charmed life.

Yet, oddly, Cook became less fluent the longer his innings went on and by the time he pushed tentatively outside off-stump and was caught off the hardest of the three chances he offered he was again looking vulnerable to his old failings.

Cook would have taken three half centuries in four innings since he and England hit rock bottom at Lord’s but his failure to cash in when everything was going for him means the wait for his 26th Test century now extends to 31 knocks.

With England‘s next Test not until next April, and with India’s frailties meaning Cook will probably not get another chance here, that long gap since he took New Zealand for 130 at Headingley last May will extend to nearly two years.

The way England have turned this Investec series around means that the pressure has lifted on Cook dramatically but the perfectionist inside him would have wanted the icing on the cake that a century here would have represented.

Such has been England’s continuing mastery of a deflated India that it will represent only a minor irritant as long as they go on here to complete their third successive victory after a nightmare run of 10 Tests without a solitary win.

That triumph could come as early as today if India once again bat as badly as they have done in Southampton, Old Trafford and now here but if it does MS Dhoni cannot really blame an attack that stuck resolutely to its task.

When Cook and Gary Ballance had taken England to 191 for one after the early loss of Sam Robson, and with India’s catching in a state of disarray, the wheels of Dhoni’s touring bus were close to falling completely off.

Yet Vijay’s sharp pouching of Cook off the persevering Varun Aaron gave India an opening to at least reclaim bit of self-respect which they did by taking another three English wickets while only 38 more runs were being added.

Ballance had looked certain to continue his Bradmanesque introduction to Test cricket by scoring his fourth hundred in only his eighth Test until he unexpectedly jabbed Ravi Ashwin to silly mid-off.

Then when Ian Bell edged a beauty from Ishant Sharma behind and Moeen Ali found another sloppy way of getting out, this time deflecting an attempted leave into his stumps, England were under the slightest semblance of pressure.

Yet any hopes India had of keeping England’s lead down to manageable proportions were quickly snatched away from them by another classy contribution from the young player at the forefront of England’s new era.

There has been much for England to be cheerful about this summer in the emergence of the likes of Ballance, Moeen, Jos Buttler and Chris Jordan but it is Joe Root who is developing into the flag carrier for all they hope to achieve.

Ever since England moved Root to five in the order this year he has left his Australian problems behind him, looking much more assertive after beginning the Test summer with a double hundred against Sri Lanka. 

 

Here he once again impressed in tandem with Buttler, the pair reasserting England’s advantage with a stand of 80, and then when he opened his shoulders in extending England’s lead to a commanding 237 in company with Jordan.

Root had always looked to be positive but as India flagged towards the end of a second day in which four overs were wasted after seven were left unbowed on Friday because of unacceptable over-rates he broke out into a near gallop.

By the close Root had added 67 off 62 balls with Jordan and stands just eight short of his fifth Test century when he resumes today.

Not only that but he has now scored at least a half century in every Test this series and has established himself as absolutely the heir apparent to Cook when the England captain eventually decides to call it a day.

Thanks to the total transformation in this series that day will not now come for a while yet and England look certain to win this series 3-1. And that looked barely believable when they were bounced out by Ishant at Lord’s.
