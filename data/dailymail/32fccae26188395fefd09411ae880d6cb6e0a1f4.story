Resplendent in a powder blue coat, the Duchess of Cambridge was every inch the glamorous mother-to-be as she arrived to meet volunteers in London this morning.

But the brand behind her chic look was no big name designer. Instead, her 'Natasha' cashmere coat came from a small Anglo-French label called Séraphine.

To those who have watched the brand grow from a small shop in 2002 to the A-list favourite it is today, the royal endorsement will come as no surprise.

Pretty stylish: The Duchess opted for a £195 'Natasha' coat worn over a delicate £95 floral maternity dress

Indeed, the Duchess has form when it comes to wearing Séraphine, having repeatedly chosen the label during both her pregnancies.

Along with today's £195 coat and £95 blue and green floral dress, she also opted for the brand when making her debut in New York.

On that occasion, it was the glamorous £225 plum boucle Marina coat that was chosen - and true to form, the design has since sold out repeatedly.

Séraphine is the brainchild of French expat Cecile Reinaud who launched the brand in 2002 from a small shop on High Street Kensington.

'Fashion has always been in my blood,' explains Reinaud. 'My grandparents supplied fabrics to some of the top fashion houses in Paris but it wasn’t until my friends started to fall pregnant that the idea for Séraphine came about.

'They struggled to find maternity clothes they liked and used to come to me with alteration requests for their clothes.

'I spotted a gap in the market for fashion forward maternity clothes and the business developed from there.'

The brand enjoyed modest success from the outset but the real making of the brand as a fashion force to be reckoned with came in August 2013 when the Duchess wore the label for Prince George's first photo shoot.

Pictured smiling happily on the sunny lawn of her parents' Bucklebury home, the Duchess looked every bit the yummy mummy as she cradled her son, then just over a month old, in her lap.

The dress, a plum coloured wrap style, was a cheap chic £39 number by Séraphine - and swiftly sold out.

Since then, the brand has gone from strength to strength and has amassed an A-list following to rival the likes of Chanel.

Singers Shakira and Gwen Stefani, model Doutzen Kroes and actress Zoe Saldana and Mila Kunis are just some of the names who have turned to the brand while pregnant. 

'Seraphine has grown from just one shop on Kensington High Street to being stocked in department stores all over the world with a celebrity following to match,' comments fashion expert Wendy Douglas.

According to Douglas, it is the brand's insistence on style rather than smocking that has won it so many fans - and its a trend she expects to see continue. 

'The label’s pieces are designed specifically for women who don’t want to compromise on style just because they’re expecting,' she explains, 'so it’s no surprise the Duchess of Cambridge has worn Seraphine so often in her pregnancies.

'Her classic take on fashion suits the brand’s sophisticated and elegant aesthetic.'

'At Séraphine, we design all of our maternity clothes with a fashion focus,' confirms Reinaud, who says everything is made with the changing bodies of pregnant women in mind.

'Our collections offer something for everyone, with a wide range of styles from Parisian chic classics to rock chic glamour.'

And she isn't wrong. While the Duchess of Cambridge plumps for styles at the classic end of the spectrum, a quick glance at Carrie Underwood looking every inch the rock chick in the brand's £55 'graphic' maternity dress is enough to prove that there's plenty of choice.

Others, among them Christina Aguilera, have taken advantage of Séraphine's stretchy separates, while Zara Tindall is among the big names who have opted for the brand's evening wear while waiting for Junior to arrive.

'Most women today want to stay true to their style through pregnancy and this is our brand motto,' explains Reinaud.

'They are looking for maternity clothes that flatter their new shape and to be versatile enough to wear day and night.'

If Reinaud's large and growing celebrity following is any indication, Séraphine is certainly living up to its stylish slogan.
