A Ukrainian man miraculously managed to escape unharmed after the road collapsed underneath him as he was driving.

Gordey Efremov was travelling home in the city of Dnipropetrovsk in south-eastern Ukraine, when the ground suddenly vanished below.

Images from the accident show Mr Efremov's 4x4 lying on its side in a giant pothole, practically swallowed by the road.

Potluck: A 4x4 has created a giant pothole after the road collapsed underneath it near Dnipropetrovsk in south-eastern Ukraine

Mr Efremov had been travelling in his Lada Niva when he suddenly found the ground vanishing underneath him.

He
 said: ‘Because of the rain, traffic was going slowly anyway and then 
when the car in front of me stopped I put on the brakes, and slow down.

‘Then
 I suddenly got this sinking feeling and before I knew it was 
disappearing into the road.

‘The car tipped onto its side and muddy 
waters started to flood in through the air vents and door.

‘I had to open the window above and climb out where some people helped me onto the street.

‘I escaped without a scratch but that's more than can be said from the car which was pretty badly broken up.’

Police
 said the broken drain had been leaking rainwater into the soil 
underneath the road, washing away the foundations and causing it to 
collapse when the car stopped.

Police spokesman Leonid Pokrovski said: ‘It was an accident waiting to happen.

‘As
 long as the cars were moving fast over the top it bore the weight, but 
once a motorist stopped it was too much and it gave way.’
