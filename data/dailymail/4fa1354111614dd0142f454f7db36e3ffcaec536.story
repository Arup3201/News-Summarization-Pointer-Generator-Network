A low-paid African immigrant to France has been sent to prison for 'insulting' the billionaire Prince and Princess of Monaco.

In a case which has sparked a debate about the power of modern European royalty, the 28-year-old Tunisian was locked up late last month.

Details of the 'crime' have been hushed up by the authorities in the notoriously secret Mediterranean principality, but the unnamed defendant pleaded not guilty.

Despite this, he was placed in handcuffs and sentenced to three months in jail on September 23, with Monaco judges handing down a stiffer sentence than prosecutors had asked for.

A week before he had been in a court room annex looking for officers who deal with employment tribunals concerning accidents at work.

There he is said to have started 'shouting ferociously' at staff, before allegedly saying some 'very unpleasant things' about Prince Albert, 56, and his pregnant wife, Charlene, 36.

These 'vulgar insults' are against the law in the tax haven, and were overheard by a bailiff, who reported them to the police.

'The judges took the case very seriously,' said a source close to the case. 'Prosecutors wanted a fine and a week in jail maximum, but he got a full three months.

'He denies that anything serious happened, and says it was all just a misunderstanding, but still ended up in prison'.

In 2008 a French court convicted a member of the public for offending Nicolas Sarkozy, France's then head of state, but he was not sent to prison.

Herve Eon had held up a sign to Sarkozy's face reading: 'Get lost you sad idiot', but was fined the equivalent of just £25.

Even then, the European Court of Human Rights ruled in 2013 that France had been wrong to convict Mr Eon.

A Monaco resident who asked not to be named for legal reasons said: 'This case sums up how people with vast inherited wealth are still treated like medieval lords.

'It is absolutely disgraceful that a poor immigrant should go to prison for insulting royalty - anybody should be allowed to speak about royalty in negative terms in this day and age.'
