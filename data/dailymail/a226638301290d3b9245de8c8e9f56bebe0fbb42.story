In the course of nearly half a century it has become one of the most familiar sounds  on radio.

But old age has finally caught up with the whistle that calls time on contestants in BBC Radio 4’s Just a Minute.

The ‘pea’ which has provided the shrill for 826 episodes of the award-winning panel game is so ancient, it has made the whistle unreliable.

That raises the almost unthinkable prospect that panellists could be left blathering on for critical seconds, even after successfully completing the challenge to speak for a minute on specially chosen subjects ‘without repetition, hesitation or deviation’.

But yesterday a BBC whistleblower revealed to the Daily Mail that help is at hand.

Production assistant Trudi Stevens, currently in charge of blowing the whistle at the end of each minute, confirms she has been given a new one – an Acme Thunderer of the kind used by referees.

It’s so loud she fears the consequences when she blows it for the first time beside veteran presenter Nicholas Parsons, who will be 91 this year. 

'I don’t want to startle him,’ she said. ‘The other week I did manage to blow the old whistle really well and it made him jump out of his seat.’

Trudi was recruited as a whistleblower in 2007, and has probably blown it around 500 of the estimated 8,000 times it has been heard since Mr Parsons chaired the first episode in 1967.

‘He tells listeners that whistleblowers need big breaths,’ says Trudi.

‘However people who follow the show tell me I have “a unique style” – which mainly means I don’t blow it hard enough.’

Yesterday, Mr Parsons declared he was delighted a replacement had been found, adding: ‘The whistle was very antiquated – I think they got it out of an old trunk somewhere, and it was somewhat unreliable.

'I hope listeners will look forward to hearing the new one.’
