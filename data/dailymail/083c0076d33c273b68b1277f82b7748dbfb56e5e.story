Grisly find: The body of James Crawford, 33, was found inside his Melbourne apartment on Monday morning

A young architect is believed to have been murdered up to two weeks before his sister found his body in his Melbourne apartment.

Police are waiting for autopsy results after the body of James Crawford, 33, was discovered with several stab wounds to his chest at 9.30am on Monday.

His sister located the remain of Mr Crawford when she went to visit him at his Albert Park apartment after no one in the family had heard from him in weeks.

Police said the 33-year-old suffered multiple blows to his chest with a sharp object and are awaiting autopsy results to identify exactly when he was killed.

Mr Crawford ran a small architecture firm, Inner Arc, from his apartment above a vintage shop on Cardigan Place.

He owned the building and rented out the bottom shopfront to Empire Vintage store.

The young architect was the son of television producer Henry Crawford and screenwriter Sarah Darling and was the grandson of the founding patron of the National Portrait Gallery, Gordon Darling, according to the Age.

Henry Crawford, who won an Emmy Award for the show A Town Like Alice, said he was in shock before flying from New Zealand to be with his family.

'It's horrid, it's a bit of a state of shock and you feel powerless,' he said.

'James is a good boy and to my knowledge, was never involved in anything shady or anything like that. It sounds to me like robbery, but I don't know.'

His last contact with his son was two weeks ago via email.

Suspicious death: Homicide detectives were brought in to investigate the architect's death after his body was found in his Albert Park street with stab wounds to the chest

Lynda Gardener, the owner of the vintage store below Mr Crawford's apartment, said she had not seen him in three weeks.

'It's so sad. I've known him for about five years and he's always been so pleasant,' Ms Gardener told the Herald Sun.

'He's a very private person but would always say hello.'

Homicide detectives are treating the death as suspicious and yesterday doorknocked the area to speak to neighbours and nearby businesses.

They said it was too early to say if Mr Crawford knew his attackers, or if it was a foiled robbery.

Mr Crawford had been living in Melbourne for two years after moving to the United States to finish his interior architecture degree in Denver and an architecture degree in San Francisco.

He previously attended boarding school at Geelong Grammar in Victoria and completed an information technology degree at Bond University.
