Adrian Peterson's mother defended the Minnesota Vikings running back in the wake of child abuse allegations against him, saying that he is 'trying hard to be a good parent'.

Bonita Jackson of Spring, Texas, said she and Peterson's father, Nelson Peterson, were 'big disciplinarians' who used hands, switches and belts to occasionally spank all six of her children.

Jackson, 50, said most parents discipline their children a little excessively sometimes, but they are trying to prepare their children 'for the real world'.

Adrian Peterson has been indicted in suburban Houston with felony child abuse after swatting his four-year-old son with a wooden switch.

On Wednesday, Nike suspended its endorsement deal with NFL star Peterson - just hours after the Minnesota Vikings deactivated him and ordered him to stay away from the team.

'Nike in no way condones child abuse or domestic violence of any kind and has shared our concerns with the NFL,' the apparel giant said in a statement.

Nike is the latest company to distance itself from Peterson and the Vikings after the former NFL MVP was arrested over the weekend on charges he severely whipped his four-year-old son with a wooden switch. 

The boy had wounds on his thighs, backside and even his genitals following the beating.  

Peterson was suspended for one game by the Vikings but was allowed back onto the team despite his actions plunging the NFL into a fresh crisis over domestic abuse, following the Ray Rice controversy.

It also emerged on Tuesday that Peterson had also been accused of abusing another of his sons, also four, but no charges were filed. 

On Wednesday, Vikings owners backtracked on their decision to allow him back on the field and admitted it was a 'mistake' to announce on Monday that he would be allowed to play again.

Peterson must stay away from the team until after his trial on felony abuse charges - though he will still collect his $700,00-a-game salary.

We made a mistake. In the end, we are getting it right,' Vikings co-owner Mark Wilf said at a press conference today.

'We have to make sure that our reputation, and the team, was moving in the right direction.'

The Vikings placed Peterson on the 'exempt/commissioner's permission' list, effectively booting him from the roster - finally bowing to pressure from outraged fans and fleeing sponsors.

Nike stores in the Twin Cities pulled all of their Adrian Peterson jerseys from shelves on Tuesday. 

On Wednesday, Minneapolis-based Target announced its stores were pulling his jerseys, as well.

Castrol Motor Oil was the first of Peterson's major sponsors to drop him, announcing on Tuesday that the contract was suspended. On Monday, Radisson Hotels said it was suspending its endorsement deal with the Vikings after owners allowed Peterson back on the field following his arrest.

At a press conference on Wednesday, Radisson's logo - normally ubiquitous - was noticeably absent.

Some of the NFL's top corporate sponsors like Anheuser-Busch, Visa and McDonald's, had also voiced disapproval over the league's treatment of its player scandals - including the decision to allow Peterson to continue to play.

Peterson was pictured on Tuesday leaving his Minnesota home to join his teammates for practice.

But the Vikings announced it was reversing its decision the following day after a time of 'further reflection' on the issues surrounding the case.

Peterson's high school football coach weighed into the furor on Wednesday, revealing how he used to beat the star player when he misbehaved - and claimed he was thanked by him afterwards.

Booker Bowie said that the Minnesota Vikings running back would get up to three lashes with an 18 inch long wooden paddle he kept in his office as part of what he called 'tough love'.

But afterwards rather than crying or complaining to his parents, Peterson would simply say: 'Coach, thank you', said Bowie. 

'Adrian understands corporal punishment...it's not intended to hurt anybody, it's to get them going in the right direction. I have never had a problem with parents calling anyone complaining.

'The way Adrian came up, his parents, his mother was disciplining him. He understands it, it helped his team mates, his classmates. I think that’s what he was doing (to his son).'

Bowie said: 'His intention was not to abuse the kid. He understands corporal punishment and I don't think his intention was to abuse the kid.

'We all sometimes make mistakes, not intentionally. He just needs to move on from it. I think he's suffered enough. I think he's learned from this'.

Corporal punishment is legal in Texas but it can result in a felony conviction if it is judged to be too severe.
