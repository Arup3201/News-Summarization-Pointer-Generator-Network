The Super Bowl is considered one of the biggest annual sporting events in the world, with an audience of more than 110million in the U.S. alone.

Companies pay $4.5million for one of the 70 advertising spots during the game, and some of the 30-second long efforts are almost as anticipated as the game itself.

Among the winners in this year's Super Bowl-ad contest were Snickers, who spoofed American classic The Brady Bunch, and Budwiser's puppies and horses, while insurance company Nationwide faced a wave of social media backlash over a commercial featuring the accidental death of a child.

WINNERS 

The Snickers commercial recreated the famous Brady Bunch episode in which the oldest daughter, Marcia, gets hit in the nose with a football. 

Actor Danny Trejo played Marcia, looking to get 'eye for an eye' revenge, until she was handed a Snickers bar, and also saw a cameo from  Steve Buscemi.

Budweiser chose to stick to the undeniably winning formula of cute puppies and horses. 

The advertisement showed a puppy chase after the iconic Budweiser Clydesdales that are being moved to a new stable, after which the horses help the little Labrador finds its way back home. All to the tune of an acoustic cover of The Proclaimers' I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles).

As always, celebrity appearances were a recurring theme during the advertisements, with Lindsay Lohan and Bryan Cranston, who appeared as his Breaking Bad character Walter White, starring in a commercial for Esurance.

The ad-breaks also saw Liam Neeson performing for Clash of Clans, Kim Kardashian taking selfies for T-Mobile, Pierce Brosnan driving a Kia and Jeff Bridges chanting for SquareSpace's Power Of Om ad. 

Dream world: Mindy Kaling appeared in a less-controversial ad for Nationwide in which she discovers she is invisible to everyone else

Another notable ad, for insurance company Nationwide, saw actress Mindy Kaling 'discovering' she is invisible. She steals ice cream from a supermarket, sits naked in Central Park and walks through a car wash. 

However, when she tries to kiss actor Matt Damon, she finds she is not invisible at all.

The two Esurance ads showed Lohan being a 'sorta' mom and Cranston's Walter White being a 'sorta' pharmacist to show when it comes to car insurance 'sorta' doesn't cut it.

McDonald's ad surrounds a promotion in which it will randomly select customers to pay for their orders with acts of love, like a high-five or a call to a relative. The promotion starts Monday and runs through Valentine's Day. 

LOSERS  

Weight Watchers tried, but failed, to deter Americans from gluttony by showing a big-brother like montage of, doughnuts, pizza and super-sized hamburger meals with an ominous voiceover saying 'You gotta eat, right?'. 

The goal was to promote its weight loss services, but some thought that the message was lost. 'Some people are saying it made them want to eat more than anything,' said Charles Taylor, marketing professor at the Villanova School of Business in Pennsylvania.   

Although Nationwide provided one of the funniest spots of the Super Bowl with it's Mindy Kaling ad, it was overshadowed by their second advertisement, which caused social media meltdown. 

The 'dark' and 'depressing' commercial tells the tale of a young boy who dies in a preventable accident. 

In the advert, the cherub-faced child talks about all the milestones he will miss out on after dying in an accident, including learning to ride a bike, receiving 'cooties' from a girl and getting married.

In a voice brimming with hope and potential, he says: 'I'll never learn to ride a bike or get cooties. I'll never learn to fly or travel the world with my best friend. And I won't ever get married.'

Speaking directly to the camera, he finishes: 'I couldn't grow up. Because I died from an accident.'

Message lost: Many people said that instead of deterring them from eating, the Weight Watchers commercial had made them hungry

A haunting image of an overflowing bathtub that presumably killed the boy then fills the screen, alongside the words: 'The number one cause of childhood deaths is preventable accidents.'

Within seconds of the advert airing on Saturday thousands of people globally had taken to social media to express their disgust.

Rob Fee, from Louisville, Kentucky, tweeted: ''Hope you guys are having a great day. Did you know your kid is probably gonna die soon? Enjoy your nachos & funeral planning!' - Nationwide.'  

In response to the criticism, Nationwide said the sole purpose of the 30-second commercial was to incite conversation and raise awareness of the issue of preventable childhood deaths. 

And the commercial certainly got people talking - landing itself the title of the most-mentioned advertiser on social media during the Super Bowl, according to  Amobee Brand Intelligence. 

Of its nearly 250,000 mentions during the game, almost two-thirds (64 per cent) were negative, 24 per cent were neutral and just 12 per cent were positive, Business Insider reported. 

Meanwhile, Nissan returned to the Super Bowl after 18 years with an ad featuring the story line of an up-and-coming race driver and his wife struggling to balance work and raising their son.

The Japanese car giant was accused of tugging at heart-strings without referring to the actual product - the vehicle. 

'Mawkish, sentimental, unimaginative, confusing – and what does it have to do with Nissan?,' The Guardian asked.

In a jarring detail that many on social media pointed out, the commercial was set to 'Cats in the Cradle' by Harry Chapin, who was killed in a car crash.  

'There has been an awful lot of stuff tugging at the heart strings,' said John Maxham, chief creative officer of DDB Chicago.

 'I'm struck at how many brands have gone with a serious almost socially minded tone to their advertising.'

Nationwide Insurance's commercial was not the only serious advert to run during the major sporting event, which was watched by more than 100million people worldwide.

'There has been an awful lot of stuff tugging at the heart strings,' said John Maxham, chief creative officer of DDB Chicago. 

'I'm struck at how many brands have gone with a serious almost socially minded tone to their advertising.' 

Carnival featured a voiceover by John F. Kennedy speaking lyrically about the sea, while Procter & Gamble's ad for its Always products brand tried to redefine what it means to 'do things like a girl'. 

Shortly after the latter ad aired, the hastag #LikeABoy started trending as men tried to counter the campaign, with many deeming it sexist and exclusionary. 

Meanwhile, a public service announcement by coalition No More depicted a chilling 911 call from a battered woman to demonstrate the terror of domestic abuse. 

The serious themes are believed to have been an effort to win over Americans who have a lower tolerance for crass ads with an overuse of sexually explicit themes and sophomoric humor.

They were a continuation of a trend that started last year when advertisers shied away from the tactics that had been commonplace during Super Bowl.

'The Super Bowl reflects what's happening in the country,' said Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. 

'Maybe in the country today we're a little more reflective and a little more pensive.'  

A Microsoft ad told the story of Braylon O'Neill, a boy who was born missing the tibia and fibula bones in both of his legs so he had to learn to live with prosthetic legs developed by Microsoft.  

Another ad scored early. Chevrolet's spot before kickoff appeared to be a live game feed that turned into static and a blank screen, shocking some viewers. Chevrolet used the trick to show that its Colorado truck has 4G LTE Wi Fi, allowing for live game streaming in the truck.
