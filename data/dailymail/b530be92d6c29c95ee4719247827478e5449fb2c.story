Tragic accident: 13-year-old Lee Warren hanged himself from his bunk bed while playing in his bedroom last year

A boy playing in his bedroom hanged himself with his shoe laces in a tragic accident, an inquest heard today.

Lee Warren, 13, was found alive by his mother but later died later in hospital.

An inquest heard that she discovered Lee hanging from his bunk bed at his home in Kingshurst, Birmingham.

Birmingham's assistant deputy coroner Sarah Ormond-Walshe said Lee had a habit of playing with his laces, putting his arms and legs through them.

'This is the tragic death of a 13-year-old boy,' she said. 'He was not anything other than a happy child on the day he died.'

Ms Ormond-Walshe told the inquest that Lee was found at 9.10pm on February 10 last year.

There was no suggestion he had mental health problems or was under the influence of any substance, she said.

'He appears to have been playing when he accidentally caused his own death by hanging.'

The tragedy was the second to hit Lee's 
family. His uncle, Patrick Warren, has never been found after he 
disappeared with a friend in Chelmsley Wood on Boxing Day in 1996.

Det Insp Michael Spellman told the inquest that no notes had been found and said Lee's mum and step-father had described him as a 'generally happy boy'.

He said there were no suspicious circumstances.

His father Derek told the Birmingham Mail that his son was a 'loveable person' who was a pleasure to be around.

Lee was a year eight pupil at John Henry Newman Catholic College in Chelmsley Wood.

John Henry College principal Jennifer McGuirk said: 'Lee wore a smile that was infectious to others.

'He was always happy. He was considerate and protective of others.

'He showed his zest for life in all that he did in our school and will be much missed by all of us.

'As a community we have joined together to express our deepest sorrow and most sincere condolences for Lee's family and all his closest friends.'
