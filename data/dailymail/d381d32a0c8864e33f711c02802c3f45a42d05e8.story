He came, he saw, but he went home more than just empty-handed.

W. A. Ilg, of Manhattan, New York, is suing a Hustler Club for allegedly charging him nearly $30,000 for alcohol when he was already drunk.

He claims to have been so intoxicated on a visit there in May that he was ‘no longer capable of conducting financial transactions’.

Lawsuit: W.A. Ilg, of Manhattan, New York, is suing a Hustler Club for allegedly charging him nearly $30,000 for drinks when he was already intoxicated

The club allegedly wrongfully charged $28,109.60 to his credit card, which was ‘far in excess of any reasonable costs’ for the alcohol.

Mr Ilg claims the Hustler Club refused to return the money to him after the night out, reported the New York Daily News.

The lawsuit said the club has committed ‘a fraud and wrongful conversion upon the plaintiff’ because it would not return the money.

Mr Ilg’s lawyer Paul Kerson said in the lawsuit that they are also looking for punitive damages after ‘outrageous’ conduct by the club.

The lawsuit follows a separate one filed against the same club last year by a Delaware man, who also said he was also falsely billed a huge amount.

W. A. Ilg's lawsuit

Gerard Wall claimed to have been charged more than $21,000 on two credit cards even though he only wanted a $300 topless lap-dance.

He said he had a huge gap in his memory and woke up the next day in Delaware after being driven home by a club employee.

Mr Wall’s case is still pending, reported the New York Post. Neither Mr Kerson or a Hustler Club spokesman have commented on the new lawsuit.
