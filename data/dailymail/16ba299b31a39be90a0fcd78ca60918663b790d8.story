There are more allegations of sexual abuse at the music school attended by Frances Andrede, who was abused there as a teenager and killed herself after giving evidence against former tutor Michael Brewer

Sexual abuse at the music school attended by Frances Andrade dates back more than four decades, ex-pupils claim.

Mrs Andrade, 48, killed herself after cross-examination during the trial of choirmaster Michael Brewer, who assaulted her while she was at Chetham’s.

Since his conviction last  week, other former pupils have come forward with allegations that the abuse began even earlier.

One, a mother in her 50s, claims she was sexually abused by eminent Chopin specialist Ryszard Bakst for five years.

She claimed she told her housemistress about the abuse in 1972, but no action was taken.

Mr Bakst, who died in 1999  at the age of 72, is the third named teacher to  be accused of preying on young female pupils at the exclusive Manchester school. He tutored there until the 1990s.

Police are now investigating claims that sexual abuse at Chetham’s was ‘rife’ in the late 1970s and 80s.

Yesterday the former pupil described Mr Bakst, who gave her piano lessons, as a ‘beast’. She said: ‘I reported it [the abuse] back in 1972, and all that happened was that we were told pupils shouldn’t be going to teachers’ houses.’

She added: ‘I must have been the first girl he abused after starting at Chetham’s – I was only 16. It went on for five years, first at Chetham’s and then at the Royal Northern College of Music.

‘The whole time I was having to fend him off, but I had to get through my degree so I had to put up with him.

‘One time he invited my parents to tea and tried to sexually abuse me while I was upstairs.

‘We were all a bit scared of “the great Professor Bakst” I think – even the staff were in awe of him. I’d be shivering in my shoes waiting for him to come in.

‘It’s too late for him to face justice now but hopefully other teachers who were abusing pupils at Chetham’s will be put behind bars now along with Brewer.’

She is due to speak to detectives in Manchester next week.

Brewer was found guilty and is awaiting sentencing. His former wife also took part in the abuse

Another former pupil described how Mr Bakst took her hand from the keyboard while giving her a one-to-one lesson and touched himself intimately with it.

One of Mr Bakst’s most successful former pupils, pianist Andrew Wilde, told the Daily Mail: ‘Bakst was a wonderful musician and a mentor and father figure to me.

‘I’m appalled to hear of what  he was doing to girls at  Chetham’s and even more horrified that it was apparently covered up.

‘This is a terrible time for everyone who cares about the school and it’s vital that it’s properly investigated now.’

Former pupils say sexual abuse at Chetham's School of Music dates back 40 years

Mr Bakst fled to Britain in 1968 after facing pressure from the Communist authorities in his native Poland.

He taught a generation of pianists at Chetham’s.

Chetham’s has said it destroys records of staff seven years after they leave but is helping police with their inquiries.

The Royal Northern College of Music, where Mr Bakst also tutored, declined to comment.

Next month it will award a prize named in his honour. Greater Manchester Police are also investigating claims made by former Chetham’s  students that  they were sexually abused by Chris Ling, a violin teacher now working as a classical music agent in California.

At the weekend he told a reporter he had no comment to make on the allegations.

At least one of the former pupils who has directly contacted police is understood to have made allegations against a fourth teacher, who has not yet been named.

A spokesman for the force said: ‘We will be working very closely with the school in the coming weeks and months but this investigation is at a very early stage.’

Brewer, 68, was last week acquitted of raping Mrs Andrade when she was 18 in 1983 but convicted of five counts of indecently assaulting her when she was under 16.

At his trial he had admitted having an affair with a 17-year-old pupil when she was head girl in 1994. His ex-wife Kay, also 68, was acquitted of aiding and abetting rape but convicted of one count of indecent assault.

They will be sentenced later.
