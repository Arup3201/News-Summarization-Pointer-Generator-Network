While he may be known for dominating Hawaii's North Shore, it appears as though Laird Hamilton is struggling with Sydney's currently underwhelming waves.

In Australia for the 2014 Southern Cross Stand Up Paddle (SUP) Festival at Port Stephens this month, the big wave surfer went for a dip at Bondi Beach on Wednesday.

At the beach to showcase his range of stand up paddle boards, Hamilton was knocked from the board - so close to the shore that he was able to stand up in the water.

Keeping himself busy during his five day visit to Australia, Hamilton will be making appearances on morning television shows and sport channels.

In addition to media appearances, he'll also be spruiking his range of paddle boards.

After leaving Sydney, he'll be travelling up the New South Wales coast to Port Stephens.

Once at the Southern Cross SUP festival at Shoal Bay, he'll be running demonstrations of his board range and meet fans.

Hamilton shot to fame after being discovered on a Hawaiian beach by a photographer.

He then went on to appear in the Italian version of Men's Vogue, going on to do a photo shoot with Brooke Shields in 1983.

Shunning the world of competitive surfing, due to the toll it took on his step-father, he is regarded as one of the world's greatest big wave surfers nevertheless.

The 2014 Southern Cross SUP Festival runs from Thursday 15 May until Sunday 18 May.
