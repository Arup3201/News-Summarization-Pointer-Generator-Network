As romantic gestures go, providing a cow to take his bride to the wedding is not one of those that is likely to catch on.

While most women dream of arriving for the biggest day of their lives in a vintage car or horse-drawn carriage groom Zheng Fu, 37, had other plans for when he wed Yi Yang, 35, in China.

The groom said he had always been fascinated by the love story of the poor cowherd Niulang from ancient mythology and wanted it to feature in the ceremony.

Groom Zheng Fu, 37, said he had always been fascinated by the story from Chinese legend of the poor cowherd Niulang

He said: 'I wanted to 
have the cow bring her to our wedding because I will be her Niulang, and
 I will love her for all eternity with my heart and soul.'

According to the legend Niulang was told by a cow where he would be able to witness the Emperor of heaven's seven daughters come down to earth to bathe.

The beautiful woman on a cow is one of the images of the Chinese Valentines Day

Captivated by the beauty of the youngest daughter, responsible for weaving the rainbows in the sky, he stole her fairy clothes so that she was unable to fly back to heaven.

And Niulang only agreed to return 
them if she promised to become his wife, and she accepted and the couple
 married and had two children.

But
 the Emperor of heaven found out why the sky no longer had its rainbows 
and took his daughter back into heaven, although after listening to her 
pleas he agreed to allow her to see her husband one day every year - 
where she would be carried across a rainbow on the back of a cow.

The
 beautiful woman on a cow is one of the images of the Chinese 
Valentine's Day but it is never really taken off as a means of transport
 to the wedding, and although reluctant bride Yi Yang, 35, agreed to be 
transported to the wedding using the unusual mode of transport.

The
 significance of the cow is that it was originally this animal that told
 Niulang where he would be able to view the Emperor's daughters bathing.

Chinese Valentines Day, known as Qi Xi, takes place on a different day each year but always around the middle of August.

Traditionally young people would go to a temple to pray for help finding a suitable partner although contemporary celebrations take a more Western form.
