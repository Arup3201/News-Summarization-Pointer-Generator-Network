A writer in San Francisco is blasting the 'sexism' of the tech industry after one jaw-dropping moment when a start-up founder gifted her a highly-inappropriate basket of gifts hoping to 'get her attention.'

Tech writer Kristen V. Brown, of the San Francisco Chronicle, says she recently received a pitch by Blake Francis, of the questions-and-answers app Need, that came with a basket of swag.

Inside: a Magic Wand vibrator, a tube of K-Y Jelly, raw oysters and Espolón Tequila.

Tech reporter Kristen V. Brown, of the San Francisco Chronicle, says Need app founder Blake Francis recently gave her a bizarre basket of swag during a pitch for coverage

Francis says he's sent similar baskets to both male and female journalists and that his company was simply trying to 'stand out,' according to Brown

Francis told Brown he 'wanted to get [her] attention' after she didn't reply to his emails. 

His plan worked — but not in a good way.

'I wondered whether the point of the gift had more to do with my gender than his company,' she wrote on a Friday column for the Chronicle. 'It seemed as though Blake Francis, the founder, was addressing me as a woman, but not a journalist.

'What’s more, the vibrator seemed to say that my sexuality was for some reason on display.'

Brown says she emailed Francis for an explanation, but he didn't seem to quite get it.

'At first he was defensive,' she wrote. 'He said he was sorry I felt uncomfortable with his choice of swag, but also appeared genuinely surprised at my discomfort.

'He didn’t want to offend me, but also didn’t understand why I would be offended in the first place. Francis didn’t seem to grasp that sex — or a woman’s sexuality — isn’t a topic appropriate for a professional setting.'

The tech writer says Francis explained all the products had been recommended on his app, Need, and that each of the gifts came with a screenshot showing in what context the product had been mentioned.

The tech founder also included K-Y brand lubricant and a bottle of tequila (neither pictured), Brown says

Francis said he'd sent the same items to both male and female journalists, according to Brown.

But, the writer, pointed out, 'people in the Need community have also recommended solar phone chargers and stores for buying high-quality letter paper, as well as doled out advice for first date spots in Berkeley.'

Francis said his company picked the items that would 'stand out,' Brown says.

'In retrospect we did not use good judgment,' he told her, according to the Chronicle 

Brown says what happened to her is an example of a rampant misogyny that permeates the tech industry

Brown says that the incident is an example of how 'misogyny is a tech industry institution that has yet to be disrupted.'

'I rarely meet a woman in tech who does not have a similar story to share, be it of the venture capitalist who hit on her, the co-worker who makes too many sexual jokes or the boss who doesn’t invite the women on the team to big meetings,' she wrote. 

'Sometimes the sexism is overt, but more often it seems unintentional — the byproduct of an industry where subtle sexism is so entrenched in the culture that it is unrecognized as sexism in the first place.'

MailOnline could not reach Francis for comment on Sunday.
