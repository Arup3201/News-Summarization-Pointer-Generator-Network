Malta's players were left somewhat amused when a Linkin Park song nearly replaced their national anthem during their friendly with Slovakia on Thursday.

With the Maltese internationals standing ready to sing their hearts out, the DJ at the MSK Zilina Stadium accidentally played the first few seconds of the Linkin Park song 'Numb' instead.

And as the inevitable laughter ensued, the person responsible quickly managed to rectify his error, managing to spare some blushes.

The Maltese side tried hard against the superior Slovakian side, and got so far, but in the end it didn't really matter as they fell to a 1-0 defeat thanks to an Adam Nemec goal.

Next up for Malta is a tough trip to Croatia for their first Euro 2016 qualifying game, who are alongside Italy as the favourites to qualify from Group H.

Whilst Slovakia face a tough trip to Ukraine, in a group also containing a Spain side looking to bounce back from their World Cup disappointment.
