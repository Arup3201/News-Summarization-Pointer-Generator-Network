Tragic: Lucia Rodrigo, 16, was found dead along with her horse in what police have ruled is a 'suspicious death'

A 16-year-old horse rider has been found dead along with her horse in what police have ruled is a 'suspicious death.'

The body of Lucia Rodrigo, 16, was discovered on a riding path in Southwest Ranches, Broward County, Florida, on Thursday afternoon.

Police were called to incident at 4:03 p.m. and found the teenager's body near that of her horse Brownie. 

Sgt. Ed Smith said the circumstances surrounding the death remain unknown, and police are investigating the incident as a 'suspicious death.'

Witnesses said just after 4 p.m. they saw the girl, a junior at Cypress Bay High, on the quarter-horse galloping past them.

The witnesses said the duo was going at a high rate of speed, comparing it to that of a race horse. 

A woman who helped teach Lucia how to ride, told CBS4 she believes the horse may have suffered an aneurysm and died on the spoy, throwing Lucia off.

The woman, who did not want to be identified, said the horse was well known in the area and did not have any known health problems. 

She also said the Lucia was an experienced rider who had ridden Brownie previously.

'Everybody loves her, she loves riding horses,' said family friend Terri Shure.

 'She was a great kid.' 

She said the teenager was riding her sister's 18-year-old horse. 

Davie Police said the horse will be taken to the University of Florida to undergo a necropsy to determine a cause of death. 

'It's a traumatic and tragic occurrence and unfortunately a young adult was killed,' said Southwest Ranches Mayor Jeff Nelson, who was on the scene late Thursday night. 

'Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends.'
