Jumping on the healthy eating bandwagon this January? Sam Faiers is offering her fans virtuous eating plans to help them trim down this month.

Sam, 23, has launched an exclusive website, Celebrity Training With Sam Faiers, packed full of tutorials, advice and tips she says will help you maximise your workout and achieve a healthy, strong and feminine dream body.

The former The Only Way Is Essex star has devised healthy alternatives to her favourite foods with the help of healthy eating specialist Sophie Bradshaw.

Sam Faiers, who has just launched a new fitness site, has added a healthy eating section to it and created  virtuous menu plans she says are 'life changing and so easy to make'

Diet-wise, Sam starts the day with an acai berry smoothie, has a sweet potato and carrot soup for lunch and a superfood kale and mushroom frittata for dinner.

Speaking to FEMAIL about her healthy new eating regime, she said: 'I also eat a lot of chicken for lunch and dinner and porridge for breakfast.

'With my Crohn’s I have to be careful with what I eat and Celebrity Training has a great healthy eating expert, Sophie Bradshaw, who recommends the best in healthy home cooking.' 

One of her favourite meals is the almond and turmeric crusted chicken with parsnip fries - a paleo recipe

One of her favourite meals is the almond and turmeric crusted chicken with parsnip fries. Speaking about the dish, she said: 'This paleo recipe gives KFC a serious run for their money. 

'No joke - the chicken strips taste so good when coated with the almonds which act as breadcrumbs when baked in the oven. 

'The parsnips are just as delicious, and are packed with fibre to keep your digestive system happy and healthy. 

'This is a fabulous pre or post work out meal to fuel your body with packs of protein.

'Trust me, you won’t ever want to stop off for a saturated fat laden chicken and chips ever again. This is life-changing and so easy.'

She has also created healthy versions of hot chocolate using peanut butter and superfoods, which she says is a great source of protein to help your body recover after working out.

'This is a perfect treat that's delicious and healthy,' she adds.

Other main meal options in her healthy-eating programme include kale and pesto baked seabass, quinoa, kale and pecan salad and celeriac, kale and mushroom frittata. 

Speaking to FEMAIL about her latest venture, the businesswoman said: 'I have wanted to step into the world of health and fitness for a while now, as it’s a big passion of mine. 

'When I lost a lot of weight from my Crohn’s disease, I wanted to make a change and make sure that I was healthy, fit and feminine.

'My motivation is to show that you can keep your body in a healthy and strong place. This is far more important than what size you are. It’s about how you feel.'

Sam, 23, has launched health and fitness website Celebrity Training With Sam Faiers

Sam isn't the first star of The Only Way Is Essex to launch a fitness project - her friend Lucy Mecklenburgh also has her own online fitness channel.

'Celebrity Training is innovative and different because you can do it at home, work or travelling so can you use it on your smartphone or tablet,'  Sam said.

'It's also completely bespoke to you; it has target graphs and you can upload pictures of your improvement. 

'I’ve been working with personal trainer Nicole Attrill to make regular workouts for the website so the content is always fresh.'

TOWIE star Sam said that she always wanted to step into the world of fitness and when she lost  weight from the Crohn's disease diagnosed earlier this year, her priority was remaining healthy, fit and feminine

Sam is so convinced by the power of her programme that she uses it three times a week on her phone or iPad when she's travelling for work.  

She starts  with the warm up, Get Started,  and finishes with Cool Down. Then she alternates between the weights-based Get Strong routine and Get Focused, which includes targeted body exercises. 

Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel condition which affects 115,000 Britons.

Its symptoms including pain, diarrhoea, vomiting, weight loss and fatigue.

Although she is following a healthy and sensible diet and exercise regime, Sam admits she has felt pressure to lose weight in the past, particularly prior to her stint on Celebrity Big Brother. 

'I think it’s because there were cameras everywhere  so there was nowhere to hide when it comes to your body,' she said candidly. 

She continued: 'I would say my Crohn’s was a wake-up call, I want to look healthy and not a bag of bones. I couldn’t help it as I was unwell but I wanted to look healthy, fit and feminine and thanks to Celebrity Training I’m so confident with my body now.

'I would say that you should feel confident at any weight or size as beauty is skin deep. I’ve struggled in the past to feel confident - I’ve either been bigger than I wanted to be or too thin. 

'Nowadays I don’t stress about being skinny, I just want to be in a healthy and happy place.'

Sam's plight didn't come without criticism and she came under attack on social media from people who said she was only skinny because she has Crohn's.

In response to those messages, Sam said: 'It's well-known that I found out I have Crohn's earlier this year. Before I got into exercising it was important for me to healthily put some of the weight back on that I'd lost. 

'When I felt ready and was at that point I began moderately training to build and tone my body. It's unfair for people to say I'm skinny because of Crohn's, you don't get abs and definition through Crohn's, it's through working out, healthy eating and my programme I have devised.' 

The fitness fan admires Beyoncé, who she says 'works so hard for her body and looks healthy at the same time', as well as  Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, who she thinks looks 'fit and feminine'.

And it seems Sam is aiming for the same level of success as the stars.

'I have a new collection coming out from my range with Very and I will be doing a launch for my lash range, Lashes by Samantha.'
