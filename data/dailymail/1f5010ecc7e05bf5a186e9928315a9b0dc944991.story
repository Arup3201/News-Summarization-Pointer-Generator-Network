George Ford and Stephen Myler will be given the opportunity to challenge Owen Farrell’s status as England’s premier playmaker, as long as they emerge unscathed from European matches this weekend.

National coach Stuart Lancaster is due to name his autumn Test squad next Wednesday and the five-way contest for No 10 places has been a subject of constant intrigue during the early stages of the season. 

Farrell’s place is assured, but Sportsmail has learned that Ford and Myler have done enough to earn selection ahead of the other prime candidates; Danny Cipriani and Freddie Burns. That pair are set to be named in the Saxons squad, barring any fly-half injuries in the coming days.

Ford is the form man, based on his exploits in the first six rounds of Aviva Premiership matches. He has played every minute of every game for Bath – a total of 480 – and tops the scoring charts, with 84 points and 33 successful kicks. 

The 21-year-old has recovered ground rapidly, having missed England’s June tour of New Zealand, in order to have shoulder surgery. In his absence, and with Farrell initially delayed and then injured, Burns started the first and third Tests – with Cipriani making replacement appearances on those occasions, in Auckland and Hamilton.

Both men returned from the trip with renewed hope about their World Cup prospects, but the delayed announcement of the England squad has apparently counted against them. 

Cipriani has shone in patches but has been hampered by Sale’s unconvincing start to the season, while Burns made a good early impact for new club Leicester, but his momentum was knocked during the Tigers’ run of three defeats and Owen Williams has taken over goal-kicking duties.

On form alone, Ford would surely start the autumn opener against the All Blacks at Twickenham on November 8, based on his all-court attacking game, allied to improved defence and composure under pressure. Myler would also be ahead of Farrell on the basis of recent exploits alone – having added layers of subtle variety under the tutelage of Alex King at Northampton, while maintaining his trademark precision.

Farrell was eased into the new campaign gently after a knee injury ended his tour and he has played a total of just 99 minutes for Saracens so far, scoring 21 points. But he has repeatedly proved his big-game credentials and providing he returns to action this weekend, as his club insist he will, then the Lion will no doubt force his way back to the head of the queue.

Another often-discussed option would be for England to unleash Ford and Farrell in tandem, as a 10-12 combination which was hugely effective at junior level. Asked on Monday if it was a possibility, Lancaster told Sky Sports News: ‘Yes, we did that in the Italy game (at the end of last season’s Six Nations).

‘Owen was starting at 10 and George was on the bench. We brought George on and Owen moved to 12, so it has been done and obviously as age-grade players they played together all the time so they understand each other and they are best mates as well.’

Another man who may soon emerge as an England No 12 contender is the union convert-in-waiting, Sam Burgess. The rugby league icon will join Bath in the coming weeks, when he has recovered from facial surgery and Lancaster knows that the newcomer is aiming high, saying: ‘Having spoken to him, his mind-set obviously is to make the World Cup squad.

‘We have some very good centres who will have something to say about that and he will have to learn the game quickly. But he also doesn’t want to come just for the World Cup, we talked about the Six Nations 2016, the Australia tour at the end of 2016, the Lions in 2017; these are all goals for him.’

Lancaster is hugely enthused by Burgess’s potential, adding: ‘What struck me when I met him is obviously he is an exceptional rugby player, but a leader too. He is mentally tough, mentally strong and when we talk about that experience and that leadership that you need in your team, if he can learn the game he will bring an invaluable amount to the group. Obviously he has got to learn the game first but he is a very, very good player and an impressive person.

‘He has a desire to dominate his opposite number and he’s played against some huge stars in rugby league. He’s taken the decision to go out to Australia at 18 years old because he wants to test himself and that’s a big thing to do. He’ s done that, he’s achieved it and now he sees another challenge in front of him and you’ve got to admire someone who has that sense of mental strength. It will be fascinating to see how he goes.’

Yet, one of those current England centres who will doing their utmost to block Burgess’s path to the top is another cross-code international and Bath player – Kyle Eastmond. Last week, he was named Aviva Premiership Player of the Month for September and he has evidently made a strong impression on Lancaster after a disappointing end to his tour of New Zealand.

‘He is rather good and he has really developed this season,’ said the coach. ‘Obviously he had a great first Test and things didn’t go for us as a back line in the third Test. I had a good chat with him afterwards and he had a steely determination in his mind, I could see him at that point saying, “Right, I’ll be back next season and I’ll be ready”.

‘He said the same thing to Bath and he’s been outstanding this season so he’s really putting a marker down for the November internationals. But I watched Brad Barritt at the weekend and he was outstanding. There’s also Billy Twelvetrees, Luther Burrell, Henry Slade’s playing well at 13; the list goes on.’

Lancaster and his assistants will prepare for the gruelling series of four Tests next month with the added reassurance of new, long-term deals with the RFU, running until the end of the 2019-20 season. The union’s announcement of the contract extensions prompted speculation about how they might respond in the event of World Cup disappointment next year, but the management still expect to be judged on merit.

‘We’re delighted that we’ve got the support of the RFU and the Board,’ said Lancaster. ‘I don't think when you’re a coach of a national side you ever get room for complacency. I don’t want to leave any stone unturned so I don't think there will be any complacency. We are judged, as we know, by results and we will be judged that way, and for me there will be no complacency.’
