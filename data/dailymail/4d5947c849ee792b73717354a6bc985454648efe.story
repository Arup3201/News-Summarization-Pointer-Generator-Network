Lance Armstrong has hit back after facing a lawsuit that claims he defrauded his sponsor, the US Postal Service.

The cyclist said that they should have known he was doping, due to extensive media coverage.

The lawsuit was filed by whistleblower, and fellow doper, Floyd Landis who also had his Tour de France title taken from him.

Defence: Lance Armstrong's lawyers say that the USPS should have known about his doping

Under federal law Landis should be entitled to up to 25 per cent of the damages awarded in the suit.They are asking for $120million.

Despite intense media speculation and an investigation into the cycling team in France, the US government renewed its sponsorship, argue Armstrong’s lawyers.

They wrote: ‘Instead, the Postal Service renewed the Sponsorship Agreement and basked in the favorable publicity of its sponsorship,' reported Deadspin.

‘It is now far too late for the government to revisit its choice to reap the benefits of sponsorship rather than investigate allegations of doping.’

Landis claims that Armstrong used false premises to obtain the government’s sponsorship money.

Armstorng’s team of lawyers also claim that the suit has been filed after the statute of limitations has expired and that due to Landis’s own experiences with drugs, he shouldn’t be allowed damages.

CBS wrote that Armstrong's council also said: ‘Although the government now pretends to be aggrieved by these allegations, its actions at the time are far more telling. 

‘Did it immediately fire the Postal Service team? Did it suspend the team pending an investigation? … It did not.’

The motion added, ‘the government wanted a winner and all the publicity, exposure, and acclaim that goes along with being a sponsor. It got exactly what it bargained for.’

Armstrong was charged by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency with systematic cheating in June 2012. 

He was stripped of his Tour de France titles in October and severed official ties to Livestrong in November 2012.

He admitted doping in a January 2013 television interview with celebrity host Oprah Winfrey.

Armstrong has slowly begun to re-emerge in public since then. 

On Monday, he joined about 20,000 others in a segment of a bicycle ride across Iowa sponsored by the Des Moines Register newspaper.

Confession: He admitted doping in a January 2013 television interview with celebrity host Oprah Winfrey

Denial: in 2005 Armstrong swore that he did not use drugs to win the Tour de France

'People, in general, have been supportive,' he was quoted by the Register as saying of the reception he has received in Iowa.

Asked about doping in cycling, he said: 'It wasn't a pretty time (in professional cycling). I didn't invent it and I didn't end it.'

'My bad for playing along,' he told the newspaper.
