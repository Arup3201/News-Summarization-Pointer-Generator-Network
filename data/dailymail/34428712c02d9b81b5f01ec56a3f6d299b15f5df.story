In her 20s, Charlotte Hawkins resembled a pin-up with soft curls and a clear, flawless complexion.

But when as a teenager, she discovered a lumpy patch of skin at the bottom of her back, Ms Hawkins could not predict the impact the subsequent diagnosis would have on her life.

Within 10 years the mother-of-one was barely recognisable, her face and body covered in bubble-like tumours. 

Today, the brave grandmother lives with America's worst case of the incurable disorder Type 1 neurofibromatosis.

Charlotte Hawkins, 64, from Georgia, lives with America's worst case of the incurable disorder Type 1 neurofibromatosis, which causes dozens of benign bubble-like tumours to cover her face and body

The 64-year-old has grown to accept her appearance after 49 years of living with the disease.

But as a young woman she admits living with the extremely rare condition has been hard. 

Ms Hawkins, who lives in a trailer in Loganville, Georgia, said: 'First I got scared. I didn't know how people were going to react when they saw me.

'When I would go out it was kind of rough - people would stare at me.'

She was 15 years old when  she first noticed the mysterious growths starting to appear on her back.

The teenager underwent surgery to have the benign lumps removed.

She said: 'When I was about 15 I had a patch on my face, I didn't know what the name of it was, because I was 15 and nobody explained it to me.

'I also had one on my back and I had it taken off and stayed in the hospital a couple of days.

'And after that I didn't seem to have anymore.

'I got married and I left home. And when I was pregnant they said I would probably have a normal baby. When I had Charles he was healthy and there wasn't anything wrong with him.'

But the growths began to return, with pronounced lumps starting to appear on her face and back.

'My husband never did say anything about my disease but it was getting worse and by the time we separated it had got very bad,' she said.

For years the condition held her hostage in her home until a church group invited her to take part in their community, helping children at a weekly playschool, pictured

Neurofibromatosis is the name of a number of genetic conditions that cause tumours to grow along the nerves.

Tumours are swellings formed by a growth of cells.

In most sufferers, their tumours are usually non-cancerous.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 is the most common form of the rare condition, affecting around one in 3,000 births.

Sufferers are born with NF1, although symptoms often develop over a number of years.

The severity varies considerably from person to person.

In most cases it causes:

Around one in three people also develop a range of further health problems:

The condition is caused by a genetic mutation, where instructions that are carried in all living cells are scrambled in some way.

There is currently no cure for the illness, instead patients are regularly monitored.

Treatment can include surgery to remove tumours.

Ms Hawkins was diagnosed as having type 1 neurofibromatosis.

However, her case was so severe, the lumps began spreading and it was no longer possible to keep removing them.

Suffering from depression and struggling with being a single mum, Ms Hawkins's condition became increasingly difficult to deal with in her 30s as people were starting to notice her condition.

She was left traumatised when she 'terrified' a child in the supermarket with her face - an event which resulted in her spending many years as a recluse.

She said: 'I was in Walmart and this little boy when he saw me, he started screaming and crying.

'And his mother had to go and I hurried to get out of the store. I was walking out from what I can remember but he was having a fit.'

For years Ms Hawkins led a quiet life, until she was contacted by her local church and was finally made to feel accepted in the community.

She began helping out at the church's playgroup, telling stories and teaching prayers to the youngsters.

Working with the children turned her life around, as the toddlers accepted her without question and treated her the same as everyone else.

Now Ms Hawkins is a happy grandmother-of-three and loves babysitting for neighbours' children in the caravan park where she lives.

'I love children,' she said. 'I live in a great community. I love playing with the kids and reading them stories. They help to make me feel young.' 

Her friend Anne Schuffer, a playgroup volunteer, said: 'I cannot remember a single time she's ever complained.

'And there have been times that people have said things to her or reacted in a way that have kind of hurt her feelings but Charlotte just keeps going.

'She has never said: "I just don't know why I have this," or, "I just don't understand it".'

Neurologist Dr Coruna Shah said: 'Neurofibromatosis is a genetic condition and it is passed on in families by an abnormal gene that is present in a chromosome.

'Charlotte comes for regular check ups. What we do is check all the individual tumours to see there has been no change in growth or size of the tumours.

'We also look into her eyes and make sure there is no loss of vision in her eyes, as there can be tumours of the optic nerve in the back of the eye and can cause her to go blind.

'It's always going to be a challenge as she gets older because her vision is going to change.'

It's now nearly 49 years since Ms Hawkins developed her first tumour and she is happy that her son Charlie and three grandchildren are completely healthy and show no signs of developing the condition.

Ms Hawkins's story will appear in a new series of Body Bizarre, which airs every Thursday at 9pm on
