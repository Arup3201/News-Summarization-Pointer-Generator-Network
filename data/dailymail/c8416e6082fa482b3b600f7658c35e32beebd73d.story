Jodi Arias told the courtroom at her murder trial on Wednesday that she enjoyed- even instigated- raunchy sex acts with her ex boyfriend before killing him, contradicting her previous accounts where she testified that he coerced her into performing for him.

At times during the trial, she said he made her feel like a prostitute, but that was not the case today.

Under aggressive questioning by prosecutor Juan Martinez on Wednesday, Arias said she was blossoming sexually and the couple's antics were helping her grow.

Martinez has been working to poke holes in her stories and has noted the duplicity of her portrayal of Travis Alexander, trying to show jurors she is lying, as he works for a first-degree murder conviction and the death penalty.

Scrutiny: The prosecution fired question after question at Jodi Arias as she appeared on the stand on Wednesday in Phoenix, Arizona over the contents of her graphic phone sex recording

Arias has said throughout the trial that Alexander coerced her into performing raunchy sex acts that at various points involved personal lubricant, the aid of Pop Rocks and Tootsie Pops, children's underwear and rope to tie her up with.

The image of her as an unwilling participant, however, was shattered today when phone recordings of the couple's conversations were played for jurors and text messages shown in court seem to indicate that she enjoyed participating.

'So when you tell us you felt like a prostitute it seems to be contradictory?' Martinez noted.

Arias said he is misunderstanding the context of the text messages and calls, during which one segment played for jurors has Arias telling Alexander: 'You are amazing. Seriously, you made me feel like a goddess.'

Refreshing her memory: Arias's lapses in memory dating back to crucial times around the murder of her boyfriend have been serious points of inquiry for prosecutor Juan Martinez

Martinez noted the call, which Arias 
recorded, came shortly after one of the encounters Arias claimed made 
her feel like Alexander was using her for sex.

'You were actually into it as much as he was, right?' Martinez asked.

'Yes,' Arias said.

Taking the stand: Wednesday was the 12th day in a row that Arias has testified

Martinez then read for jurors 
salacious text messages between Arias and Alexander, one of which has 
Arias describing how she wanted to be treated 'like a dirty little 
schoolgirl'.

She previously testified that was just one of Alexander's 'deviant' sexual fantasies that made her uncomfortable.

'You did enjoy dressing up though, right?' Martinez asked.

'Um, yes,' Arias replied.

'It was a consensual mutual relationship sexually speaking, wasn't it?' Martinez prodded.

'Yes, always,' Arias said.

'No indication that you were offended?' the prosecutor continued.

'Correct,' Arias replied.

Much of the afternoon session was dedicated to unraveling her decisions during the 48-hours leading up to Alexander's death.

One decision that she remains unable to fully explain is why she bought two 5-gallon cartons and one 2-gallon carton of gas while in California as she prepared to drive to Alexander's house in Arizona.

Ignoring the fact that she had 12 gallons in her trunk that remained untouched on her way to the house, she went on to stop at two other gas stations in Arizona to fill up her tank. Using estimates of 2008 gas prices, those moves would have left her with only a small portion of her estimated $200 that she thought she brought on the trip with her.

She offered no explanation as to why she left the gas in her trunk, though the prosecution is undoubtedly trying to use it as an example of how she premeditated the murder.

Logistics of the scene: Arias explained- using a picture of Alexander's bedroom- where and how she was tied up to the bed during sex and how she was a willing participant

Not adding up: Arias said that she bought 12 gallons of gas in California allegedly to save money, but then went on to refuel two other times- with one receipt shown in court above- during her drive to Alexander's house without touching the gas she brought with her

Her own words: because she gave a number of media interviews while in jail, those stories are being played back for the courtroom. Now she admits that much of what she said during those interviews were lies

Their other example of premeditation 
is the idea that Alexander did not have a gun in his house- as Arias 
claimed he did- but that she stole the .25 caliber gun from her 
grandparents house a week before the killing. It is the same make as the
 gun that was used to kill Travis, but neither gun has ever been found.

Another weapon that was used to kill Alexander was his kitchen knife, with which Arias stabbed him 27 times.

In previous testimony, she alleged 
that it was in the bedroom before their supposed altercation because 
they had used it to cut the rope that they used to tie her up during 
sex.

Today she said they only used the 
knife in the bathroom to initially cut the rope to the size they needed 
for their sexual activity, but in earlier versions she said that 
Alexander brought it into the bedroom to cut the rope off her when she 
was tied to the bed.

Martinez
 also questioned Arias over her repeated lies to authorities, friends 
and family in the days after she killed Alexander.

She
 first claimed to know nothing about the killing, then later blamed it 
on intruders, providing descriptions of the attack by two masked people 
in several media interviews. She eventually settled on self-defense. She
 was too ashamed and frightened of the consequences to be truthful, she 
told jurors.

The beginning: Arias looked like an entirely different person back in 2006 when she and Alexander met

Martinez noted that even her lies were changing as she spoke to various media organizations.

'I couldn't keep my stories straight,' Arias said.

The
 prosecutor also noted how Arias has alternately described Alexander as a
 cheating womanizer, an angry man with a violent temper who once choked 
her into unconsciousness, while simultaneously a caring, loving 
boyfriend.

Today marked the 12th day where Arias 
took the stand in her own defense, as she is facing the death penalty 
for killing Alexander by shooting him and stabbing him 27 times inside 
his Mesa, Arizona home in June 2008.

Throughout
 the trial, she has claimed that she killed Alexander in self defense as
 he was attacking her after she dropped his camera during a salacious 
nude photo shoot in his shower.

This is not the first version of events that she has used to describe what happened to Alexander on the night of his death.

First she told investigators that she was not in the state, let alone his house on the night of the murder. Later, she described an elaborate story where there was a pair of masked intruders who broke into his house and attacked them, eventually killing Alexander.

After months of repeating this story and telling it during filmed television interviews, she now says that hew as abusive to her and she killed him in self defense.
