Among the grand targets being pursued by Daryl Murphy, from career redemption to a place in the Premier League and a run in the FA Cup, is a piece of paper worth £100.

Written on it are his name and a number that seemed unfeasibly high when he scrawled it last summer. Once folded, it was handed to Mick McCarthy with the cash.

Like most aspects of life at Ipswich Town, it was the manager’s idea. ‘He called us together one day before the season started and told us all to do it,’ Murphy explains.

‘Strikers had to put down what they were going to score this season, goalkeepers had to write how many clean sheets and so on. Then we each had to put £100 into the gaffer’s pot — it is going to charity if you don’t reach your number.

Eoin Doyle (Chesterfield) - 18

Daryl Murphy (Ipswich) - 17

Andy Williams (Swindon) - 17

Chris Martin (Derby) - 15

Diego Costa (Chelsea) - 15

Sergio Aguero (Manchester City) - 14

Marc Richards (Northampton) - 13

Jonathan Forte (Oldham) - 13

Charlie Austin (QPR) - 13

Britt Assombalonga (Nottingham Forest) - 13

‘If you reach it you get it back. You don’t put down a low number because it’s for charity and besides, the gaffer would never allow it. I put down quite a high number. I won’t tell you what it was as I’m not there yet but it looks like I might get there.’

Like a number of McCarthy’s decisions, it seems to have had a positive effect on the 31-year-old striker who was once drifting but is now the leading scorer in the Championship; a 17-goal spearhead in a team who sit third in the division.

Tonight Ipswich try to accomplish what Manchester United failed to do and beat third-placed Premier League side Southampton, in an FA Cup third-round replay at Portman Road.

It’s not bad for a club that was bottom of the Championship table when McCarthy arrived in November 2012. Only Tyrone Mings, a £10,000 signing from non-League Chippenham, commanded a fee. The rest of his recruits, including Murphy, cost nothing.

For Murphy, the Championship player of the month for December, the goal rush is something he never saw coming.

‘I’m as surprised as anyone about how this season has gone,’ he says. ‘This is the best time of my career.’

The Republic of Ireland international spent the first few years bouncing from League Two with Luton to the League of Ireland, before McCarthy took him to Sunderland in 2005.

It was good but not much more for a striker mostly playing on the left wing — if at all. He never scored more than three goals in a season and the games dried up. In 2010, Celtic’s Neil Lennon came along.

‘They were the team I supported as a boy, so I took a pay cut to go but it didn’t go well. When I was given a run in the team I scored two in three starts, but then I got injured.

‘There was a game I was sitting out when we won 9-0 — the strikers, Gary Hooper and Anthony Stokes, scored a hat-trick each. I’m in the stands thinking, “How is your luck?” I didn’t play that next weekend, obviously, and the lads kept scoring. I couldn’t get back in and I accepted that.’

He spent two loan spells at Ipswich between 2010 and 2012 and it was during a third spell at the club in 2012-13 that McCarthy took over. The following summer the move became permanent.

‘Maybe I was destined to play for Ipswich,’ Murphy says. ‘I came here under Roy Keane. I got on brilliantly with him and do still. He gave me a copy of his book — a good read. I didn’t get a mention!

‘The gaffer now has done so much for me. On his first day here he called me into his office and said I would be a striker again, no more playing on the left. It was music to my ears. His faith in me has been so important.’

QPR striker Charlie Austin has been in spectacular form for Harry Redknapp's men this season 

The result was 13 goals last season and a stunning run in this campaign. The signs are good, even if the challenge of maintaining their form will be increased by interest in Mings.

Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has admitted he is keen on the defender but Murphy said: ‘I don’t see why he should go when he is playing here every week. If you go to a big club you are probably going to be on the bench. In that position, I would rather play every week.’

The words carry weight from a man who has served his time on the sidelines. If Mings sticks around then Murphy will have a better chance of getting back to the Premier League.

Either way, you would not bet against him getting back his £100.
