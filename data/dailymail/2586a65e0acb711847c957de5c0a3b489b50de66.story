A 36-year-old Utah woman with a history of mental illness and long criminal record is accused of stabbing her mother to death as she lay in bed, where she had remained for several days before her body was discovered Monday.

Airida Maria Gruodis told police ‘bad things happen’ when she's off medication shortly before her arrest.

Police in the Salt Lake City suburb of Cottonwood Heights said Gruodis’ father blamed her for the killing and that they have evidence to prove it.

Peter Gruodis, 60, however, didn't report his wife was dead until police pulled him over at around 3pm Monday for erratic driving. Investigators believe his wife was slain a day or two before.

An officer was interviewing Gruodis for several minutes when he unexpectedly blurted out that he was ‘distraught because his wife was dead" in their home, a jail report states.’

Police arrived at the family’s home on Chadbourne Drive at around 3.30pm and discovered  Zita Gruodis' body on her bed with numerous knife wounds, police Sgt. Gary Young said. She was 58.

Surprise admission: The victim's husband, Peter Gruodis, was pulled over during a traffic stop and told officers that he was driving erratically because he was distraught over his wife's murder

When detectives interviewed Peter 
Gruodis again, he said his daughter had reacted with ‘indifference’ 
after he discovered his wife's body. Young called the husband's failure 
to promptly report his wife's death ‘quite peculiar.’

The
mother, a Latvian national, had a series of protective orders filed 
against her daughter in the past, but none at the time of the killing, 
he said.

‘We've been there numerous times for mental health issues,’ Young said Tuesday. ‘It was very tragic.’Airida
Gruodis was being held without bail at Salt Lake County jail on charges
of aggravated murder and assault by a prisoner— she allegedly bit an 
arresting officer's hand and had to be placed in a restraining hazmat 
suit.

Utah court records 
show the woman has a seven-year criminal record complicated by a bipolar
disorder. She was most recently charged February 9, also with assault 
by a prisoner.

According
to court records, the 36-year-old woman allegedly kicked an officer at 
the jail who was trying to get her ready to go to court. That felony 
charge remains unresolved.

Also, she has been in and out of hospitals and is under the supervision of a mental-health court, records show.

Her father, Peter Gruodis, also was being held Tuesday at Salt Lake County jail on an unrelated domestic-violence warrant. Court records show he has a history of DUIs, medical seizures and car accidents.

Zita Gruodis, who owned a massage parlour in Holladay, also had had run-ins with the law. On February 12, she was arrested for domestic violence. Online records list another arrest in 2004 on an unspecified charge. 

When officers visited the family duplex Monday, Airida Gruodis was ‘evasive and dismissive’ about her dead mother, jail documents said.

She acknowledged being off her 
medication, which means ‘bad things happening,’ she told police. Young 
said he didn't know what type of medication the woman was taking or have
any information about her mental health condition.

In a separate police interview, Peter Gruodis said his daughter had a ‘volatile relationship’ with her mother.

In
a handwritten letter filed in June, Mrs Gruodis begged a 3rd District 
judge to help her daughter. The one-page note, written in broken 
English, reads in part: ‘… How she behave, it was insene," she wrote. "I
just have one daughter, and she does'n have freedom,’ Desert News reported.

Gruodis
claimed police forced her to get a protective order against her 
daughter because an ambulance had been called to her house.

Court records show a judge dismissed the no contact order at a 3rd District Court hearing in July.Neighbors told police they heard a loud argument between daughter and mother on the day of her presumed death.

Gruodis’ landlord and friend, David Sollis, said he believes the victim’s daughter should have been committed to a mental institution if for no other reason than to protect her mother.

‘She is a threat to society and has been ever since they let her out approximately three years ago,’ he said of Airida Gruodis. ‘(Zita) loved her daughter. But she couldn't control her daughter's medications.’
