The mental state that contributed to Khaled Sharrouf turning into an Islamic extremist was left untreated for most of his stint in prison for terrorist activities and this only escalated his condition, according to his former psychiatrist.

Sharrouf is wanted by the Australian Federal Police for alleged terrorist activities in the Middle East after he fled the country in December on his brother's passport.

An oversight by the then-Department of Corrective Services meant the 33-year-old father-of-five, from Punchbowl, did not receive any treatment for his mental health issues until mid-2008, just months before he was released from jail in 2009, according to The Sydney Morning Herald.

Khaled Sharrouf's mental condition was left untreated during his four-year stint in prison

A judge said his mental state contributed to him turning into an Islamic extremist

Sharrouf was jailed in 2005 and spent time at Goulburn and Lithgow prisons for his part in Operation Pendennis - a terrorist cell that operated in Melbourne and Sydney and was planning an Australian attack.

In 2005, psychiatrist Olav Nielssen - a renowned psychiatrist who sits on the NSW Mental Health Review Tribunal - assessed Sharrouf's condition and discovered the jihadist had depression, acute schizophrenia, paranoia and had suffered from hallucinations for a number of years, with signs of mental illness showing as early as the 1990s.

This emerges after Sharrouf recently shared a photo of his young son, believed to be seven years old, holding up a severed head on social media, which attracted widespread condemnation.

A judge residing over Sharrouf's case had said his mental issues had driven him to jihad.

It was heard in court his mental issues had 'predicated him towards extremism and radicalisation by others', The Sydney Morning Herald reported.

The picture of Sharrouf's son caused widespread outrage, attracting comments from Tony Abbott to U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry

But leaving him 'languishing' without treatment for all those years had done him more harm, Dr Nielssen said.

'There was ample documented evidence of pre-existing mental illness that would have been exacerbated by a lack of treatment when incarcerated,' he said.

In 2009, Justice Anthony Whealy said corrective services were too slow in responding and only reacted after 'a good deal of prompting'.

But when treatment started for Sharrouf he did recover for a bit but reverted back to his old ways when he stopped taking medication and returned to seeking out other Islamic extremists.

The latest controversy Sharrouf has stirred up involves a photo posted on Twitter last week of his son holding up a severed head, along with a caption: 'Thats my boy!'

It was accompanied by a photo of Sharrouf himself holding the same head, written with the words: 'What a head', and another of him and three young boys brandishing rifles.

The photos caused widespread condemnations from Tony Abbott (left) and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry (right)

The photos sparked worldwide condemnations from Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry.

Tony Abbott said photographs such as this one highlighted the 'barbaric' nature of IS, which he said was trying to establish a 'terrorist state' in Iraq.

'I believe there are more photographs in the newspapers in Australia today of the kind of hideous atrocities this group is capable of,' he said.

Mr Kerry echoed Mr Abbott's comments, saying: 'This image, perhaps even an iconic photograph... is really one of the most disturbing, stomach-turning, grotesque photographs ever displayed,' Mr Kerry told reporters.

'Of a 7-year-old child holding a severed head up with pride and with the support and encouragement of a parent, with brothers there.

'That child should be in school, that child should be out learning about a future, that child should be playing with other kids - not holding a severed head and out in the field of combat.'
