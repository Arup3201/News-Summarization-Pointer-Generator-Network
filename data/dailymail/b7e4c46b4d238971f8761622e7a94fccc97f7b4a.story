Jose Mourinho has claimed Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola is bald because he doesn't enjoy football, according to El Confidencial.

The Chelsea manager's comment comes after the pair allegedly clashed during last week's manager's meeting at UEFA's headquarters over the length of grass on pitches.

Continuing the feud, Mourinho is alleged to have said of his rival: 'When you enjoy what you do, you don't lose your hair, and Guardiola is bald. He doesn't enjoy football.'

The Daily Express claim the initial spat began when Guardiola insisted grass should be no longer than 1.5cm long in order to make the game quicker.

Mourinho reportedly responded: 'Everyone has his style of play, which should be respected. Football can be spectacular in several ways.'

Guardiola is said to have replied: 'The beauty of football depends on the coach. It seems to me that Mourinho prefers the result to the spectacle.' 

The recent feud is the latest disagreement between the pair who had a heated rivalry during the days when Mourinho was in charge of Real Madrid and Guardiola was in the Barcelona hotseat.
