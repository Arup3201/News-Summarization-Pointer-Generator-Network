He might not have had much luck on the track, but Sunday at the Commonwealth Games was still an occasion to remember for Scotland's Chris Pritchard.

Keirin rider Pritchard leapt from his bike after losing out in race to decide the final standings, before climbing into the stands, still wearing his lyrca race gear, to propose to his girlfriend Amanda Ball.

Fortunately she said yes - and that decision led to celebrations in the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome that rivaled anything from the day's track cycling action.

And it was lucky she did, after Pritchard could only finish third in a race to decide who was the seventh place finisher in the men's keirin.

But the 31-year-old later admitted that the proposal had been the end of a long thought-out plan.

'I have been plotting this for about five or six months. It has taken a lot of hard work,' he said.

'I thought, "she is going to say yes" so I just put that away and I just thought about what was going on in the keirin. It was a really good keirin, I really enjoyed it.'

However, new fiancee Ball said she knew the question was coming at some point before Pritchard vaulted his way up the stairs in the Velodrome.

'It was never in doubt,' she said.

'I have been nagging for long enough. The ring is just like the one I took a picture of and left on the computer screen!'

Hugo Barrette of Canada came out on top in that contest while Matthew Glaetzer won the gold later in the evening on the last day in the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome.
