An obsessed 24 fan who changed his name to Jack Bauer cut a taxi driver’s neck in a bizarre planned attack.

The 26-year-old, who changed his name from Carl Ennis to that of the TV drama’s star, donned a balaclava and padded vest before asking his girlfriend if she would still love him if he hurt someone.

Bauer, from South Shields, who had no previous convictions, told taxi driver David Pearson he was going to a fancy dress party before attacking him as he drove in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear.

Newcastle Crown Court heard Bauer pulled out a flick knife and pressed it against Mr Pearson’s neck. Judge John Milford described the incident as ‘extraordinary’ as he jailed him for 16 months.

Bauer had been drinking heavily before the incident, in the early hours of November 30.

Following a night out, he got out of bed shortly after midnight. And when his girlfriend went to see where he was, she found him dressed in combat gear in the lounge, holding a weapon.

Michael Bunch, prosecuting, said: ‘He said: “Would you still love me if I hurt someone and got arrested?” He left the house and it would appear he took with him an extendable baton which had been by the bed and a flick knife.’

Bauer’s partner was so concerned by him she called the police. But Bauer had already left the home and got into Mr Pearson’s taxi, which he had booked. 

As Mr Pearson drove along the Felling Bypass in Gateshead, he noticed Bauer was slipping down in his seat, the court heard.

And then as he slowed to approach a set of lights the driver suddenly heard a ‘rustling’ sound and felt a sharp object get pushed against his neck.

‘He immediately pulled away and grabbed the defendant’s arm,’ said Mr Bunch. ‘He said his heart was pounding and he was petrified.’

Mr Pearson jumped out and called the police.

Bauer was arrested soon after and pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm and possessing an offensive weapon at Gateshead Magistrates Court the following day.

He was remanded in custody and the case was sent to crown court for sentencing.

Joe Hedworth, defending, said: ‘This a man who has never ever been to prison. He’s asked me to convey publicly his sincere apologies.

‘Since that night he has attempted to recall the events of that night but failed.’

Judge Milford sentenced him to eight months for each offence to run consecutively.

The court heard Bauer took the name of Kiefer Sutherland’s counter-terrorism agent character in the TV series because he wanted to make a fresh start after a family bereavement.
