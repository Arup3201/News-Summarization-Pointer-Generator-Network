Manuel Pellegrini admits Manchester City need a 'crack' player to take them to the next level. The term is used in Spain to describe a world star, a galactico, who can transform the team. 

The reigning Premier League champions saw their hopes of retaining the title diminish after a shock 1-0 defeat by Burnley on Saturday. 

Here Sportsmail identifies five names City have considered as they approach a pivotal summer in their development.

PAUL POGBA

Juventus £55m

City have trailed Pogba since he was on their doorstep at Manchester United. The 22-year-old can be the dominant force in City's midfield for years to come and add the extra energy they have lacked this year. 

Juventus general director Giuseppe Marotta said: 'There are many suitors for Pogba, but we do not want to open negotiations and we want him to stay with us.' That said if clubs offer £55m it will be difficult for the Italians to reject.

Chances: 4/5

The Italians insist Pogba is not for sale but an offer in excess of £55m could prove too tempting

KEVIN de BRUYNE

Wolfsburg £35m

Has grown into one of the best midfielders in Europe on current form. He is playing as a No 10, dominating games, creating chances and scoring goals. The Belgian could prove to be one of Jose Mourinho's biggest mistakes.

Yes, Chelsea made a profit when they sold him but he now looks a player who can have greater influence on a game than Oscar and Willian. City have watched him closely this season and Wolfsburg expect a bid.

Chances: 4/5

KOKE

Atletico Madrid £44m

The jewel in the crown of Atletico Madrid. Managers have gone to watch him and questioned whether he was big and strong enough for the Premier League but he is 5ft 10ins and, like the smaller Marco Verratti at Paris St Germain, Koke has the athleticism and strength which allows him to handle the rough treatment. 

Has proven at European and domestic level he is a player of repute. Much will depend where Diego Simeone ends up.

Chances: 2/5

GARETH BALE

Real Madrid £75m

Bale is determined to ride out the storm in Madrid but won't be short of admirers should he opt to leave. Despite the fuss over Manchester United's overtures to him, Bale was aware of City's interest prior to his departure from Tottenham and would listen if his time at Madrid was up. 

A homegrown player to boot, he has matured since leaving White Hart Lane and would give City the pace and direct dynamic they have lacked this season.

Chances: 3/5

CRISTIANO RONALDO

Real Madrid £80m

Surely not? The chat among some City players last week was that Cristiano Ronaldo was destined for Manchester and not the Old Trafford side. It's almost unthinkable considering his affection for all things United. 

His agent Jorge Mendes says he will retire at Madrid but tensions are undoubtedly high as the unforgiving Bernabeu crowd see fit to criticise a phenomenal player who has scored 280 goals for them.

Chances: 1/5

They say never say never, but surely Cristiano Ronaldo signing for United's rivals is unimaginable? 

The Ballon d'Or holder was supposed to finish his career at the Bernabeu but has cut a frustrated figure
