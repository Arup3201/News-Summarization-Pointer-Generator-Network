Fishermen the world over are known for being prone to exaggerating the size of their catch.

But a bizarre game of 'my one's bigger than yours' appears to have broken out between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Belarussian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko, who have got their lines crossed over who has caught the biggest fish.

Just days after Mr Putin claimed to have caught a giant pike on a fishing trip, his next door neighbour Mr Lukashenko has boasted about catching a man-sized catfish.

Tiddler: Mr Lukashenko describing how Mr Putin's pike was 'only this big' when compared with the catfish he hauled from the Pripyat river

Earlier today Belarussian state television showed Mr Lukashenko telling a government meeting about how he had wrenched a 126lb (57kg) catfish from the Pripyat river.

During the boastful exchange, he did not mention Mr Putin or where exactly he had landed the monster.

But deputy prime minister Mikhail Rusiy, who claimed to have witnessed the seismic event, said: 'It was as long as I am tall.'

Last week Mr Putin claimed to have caught a pike weighing a whopping 46lb (21kg) while fishing in Siberia.

He described it as a 'gigantic animal'.

It was the latest in a long string of macho exploits by the Kremlin leader, which drew scepticism and mockery on social media.

Fishy tale: Last week Mr Putin claimed to have caught this 46lb pike in Siberia, although sceptics warned it probably weighed less than a quarter of that

Blogger and author Alfred Kokh calculated the length, diameter and volume of the fish and said it could only have weighed ‘10-11kg' and not 21kg.

Pro-opposition journalist Oleg Kashin added that a fish with the density of a 21kg pike the size of the one caught by Mr Putin would simply have sunk to the bottom of the lake.

‘A pike that heavy just could not swim,’ Mr Kashin wrote on Twitter. ‘She would sink to the bottom! In fact this pike was made from granite.’

A caption placed under two online pictures - one of Mr Putin holding the fish and the 
other showing Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev emerging from a river in a 
wetsuit with a satisfied look - read: ‘Wonder who planted that fish for Putin to catch?’

Although Belarus is Russia's closest ally, the relationship between Lukashenko, 58, and Putin, 60, has long been uneasy.

The pair have exchanged critical and sometimes sarcastic comments about each other for years as Lukashenko has resisted the strengthening of Russia's influence over its smaller neighbour.

Now that's a catfish: In 2005 this beast, similar to that caught by Mr Lukashenko, was pulled out of the River Ebro in Spain. Sadly photographic evidence of Mr Lukashenko's catch has not been released
