Crazed: The gunman has been identified as 42-year-old Pedro Vargas

A grazed gunman stalked from apartment to apartment, systematically killing his neighbors at a South Florida apartment complex before a police SWAT team shot him dead early Saturday.

Police described how Pedro Vargas methodically executed the managers of his building and a family that lived nearby - before firing randomly into the street and killing a man who was parking his car.

Police say he kicked his way into a third-floor apartment, where he shot to death Patricio Simono, 54; his wife Merly Niebles, 51; and their 17-year-old daughter Priscilla Perez.

The Miami Herald reports that he hunted down Perez as she hid in the bathtub and shot her dead.

Family members said Simono worked at a car wash and Niebles cleaned hotel rooms. Their daughter wanted to be a nurse.

Marcela Chavarri, director of the American Christian School, said the Perez was about to enter her senior year.

'She was a lovely girl,' Chavarri said through tears. 'She was always happy and helping her classmates.'

Shamira Piscioti cries on the phone after her parents Italo Piscioti, 78, and Samira Piscioti, 68, were shot to death at an apartment building in Hialeah, Florida

Detectives were investigating whether Vargas had any ongoing disputes with the building manager, as some residents believed.

Vargas lived in the fourth-floor apartment with his mother. She was not home at the time of the shootings.

'He was a good son,' said Ester Lazcano, who lived on the same floor as Vargas and his mother. 'He'd take her in the morning to run errands' and to doctor appointments.

Miriam Valdes, 70, was in a friend's apartment two doors down. She said she heard officers trying to convince Vargas to surrender.

She said the gunman first asked for his girlfriend and then his mother but refused to cooperate.

Valdes said Vargas was also known as a difficult person who sometimes got into fights and yelled at his mother.

'He was a very abusive person,' she said. 'He didn't have any friends there.'

Police got a call around 6:30 p.m. on 
Friday that shots had been fired in a complex which houses 95 apartments
 in Hialeah, just a few miles north of Miami.

Police fill the street at the scene of a shooting which left seven people dead, including the gunman, at an apartment building in Hialeah, Florida

The
 ordeal lasted eight hours, with Vargas running through the building, 
firing at random and eluding officers for part of it, police said.

The
 situation started after Vargas set the fourth floor apartment, that he 
shared with his mother, on fire with a combustible liquid by setting 
ablaze a pile of cash.

When property managers 68-year-old Samira and 78-year-old Italo 
Pisciotti ran towards the apartment to see what was happening he shot them both.

Vargas
 then ran back into his burning apartment and fired 10 to 20 shots into 
the street from a balcony, killing a third victim Carlos Javier 
Gavilanes.

The 33-year-old 
father, who was at the apartment building across the street, had just 
arrived home from work and was standing in the parking lot next to his 
car when he was killed.

Vargas then proceeded to run through the building, firing at random with a 9 mm pistol and eluding police.

'He kept running from us as he fired at us, and we fired at him,' said police spokesperson Carl Zogby.

Police said he forced his way into an apartment and took two people hostage at gunpoint.

A crisis team was able to briefly establish communication with Vargas. Sgt. Eddie Rodriguez said negotiators and a SWAT team tried talking with him from the other side of the door of the unit where he held the hostages.

Miriam Valdes, 70, who lives on the building’s top floor said she heard about eight officers talking with him as she stayed holed up at the neighboring apartment. She said officers told him to 'let these people out.'

'We're going to help you,' she said they told him.

She said the gunman first asked for his girlfriend and then his mother but refused to cooperate.Rodriguez said the talks eventually 'just fell apart.' Officers stormed the building, fatally shooting the gunman in an exchange of gunfire.

Victim: At just 17 years old, Priscilla Perez was the youngest victim of the shooting rampage

Victim: Patricio Simono, 64, and his wife and daughter were three of the six victims of today's rampage shooting

Victim: Merly Niebles and her family lived below the gunman who fatally shot her, her husband and the couple's 17-year-old daughter

The building across the street where Carlos Javier Gavilanes was shot is called Casa Royal, or Royal House in English

'They made the decision to go in there and save and rescue the hostages,' Rodriguez said. Both hostages survived.

Neighbors said the shooter lived in the building with his mother.

'He was a good son,' said Ester Lazcano, who lived two doors down from the shooter. 'He'd take her in the morning to run errands' and took her to doctor appointments.

But Valdes said he was known as a difficult person who sometimes got into fights and yelled at his mother.

'He was a very abusive person,' she said. 'He didn't have any friends there.'

Gunman Pedro Vargas started a fire in the apartment he shared with his mom on the fourth floor before he killed six innocent people

They were identified by their daughter Shamira Pisciotti, who told NBC6 that she heard shots and ran over to her parents' building, where she found her mom dead and her father clinging to life.

'My mom was dead the moment that she was shot and my dad still had a pulse when I got to him,' she said.

Shamira Pisciotti said she believed that there had been a complaint about the shooter and that he confronted her parents about it, and that he then shot them.

'They got complaints from some neighbor that a situation was going on they went upstairs to do their duty as property managers,' Pisciotti’s fiancée, who did not want to be identified, told CBS Miami.

Other witnesses describe hearing between 10 and 12 shots.

Patricio was a handyman at the apartment complex and worked with the building managers.

American Christian School principal Sergio Chavarri said Perez was a student at his school and would have gone into 11th grade this year.

Perez, who wanted to be a nurse, never missed one day of class in the four years that she attended the school which takes pre-K through high school students, he said.

'She was a very nice person,' Chavarri said. 'We can't believe that such a nice person should be, you know, something like that.'

Vargas lived in the building with his mother, police are still investigating his motive for the shooting spree

The shootings took place at this apartment complex in Hialeah, Florida on Friday evening and the early hours of Saturday morning

In Hialeah - a suburb of about 230,000 residents, about three-quarters of whom are Cuban or Cuban-American - the street in the quiet, apartment-building-lined neighborhood was still blocked by tape Saturday afternoon.

The building where the standoff occurred is an aging, beige structure with an open terrace in the middle. The apartment where neighbors said the shooting started was charred, the door and ceiling immediately outside burned black.

Rodriguez said police are still investigating the motive.

‘Investigators are talking with families of the victims, neighbors, people that were present when all this began,’ he said.

‘That way we can start to piece together this huge puzzle that we're working with.’

The fire was contained to Vargas’ apartment and his mom, who wasn't home at the time, is currently staying with relatives.

Zogby called the whole building a crime scene. 'He probably fired dozens of shots during the whole incident,' he said.

'It could have been a much, much more dangerous situation.'
