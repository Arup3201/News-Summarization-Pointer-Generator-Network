A Swedish couple made an unusual discovery when they renovated their living room - a gravestone.

Gert Nilsson was digging up the floor his lounge in Fuglie, near Malmö, southern Sweden, when his shovel hit something, quite literally, rock solid.

The headstone is well preserved and fully legible, and carries the names of two men and one woman who died in the mid-1800s.

Grave find: The 6ft 7in headstone was found by Gert Nilsson while he was renovating his lounge, and carries the names of two men and one woman who lived on their farm in the mid-1800s

Mr Nilsson is a carpenter and has spent the past few years renovating the family home, and made his discovery working on a room in the former farm-hand’s quarters.

When digging underneath the floorboards in the living room, he uncovered the gravestone.

‘I was digging away to get a bit further down when my shovel hit something hard,’ Gert Nilsson told Kvallsposten.

‘When I kept going and cleared away the dirt around it, I thought “it’s a bloody gravestone”’.

It is nearly 6ft7in long and four inches thick and carries three names and death dates.

Mystery solved: The headstone is thought to have been moved from a nearby church when the graveyard was rebuilt in 1904 (stock image)

Jöns Eriksson, who died 1843,  Måns Nilsson, who died in 1851, and then ‘their spouse’ Karna Månsdotter, who died in 1884, aged 68.

‘I suspect Karna was married to Jöns and then Måns,’ says Gert’s wife Carin Nilsson.

All three lived on ‘Fuglie Number 19’, the same farm property that Mr and Mrs Nilsson now live in.

However, the farm-hands quarter where the stone was found was not built until more than a decade after the death of Karna Månsdotter.

Local priest Inger Krigström’s theory is that the stone was removed from the grave after a new church was built in 1904 and so the family of Månsdotter took the stone and put it under the floor.

Mrs Nilsson has since tried to track down information about Karna Månsdotter and her supposed husbands.

Mr Nilsson plans to dig up the stone this weekend and move it into the garden.
