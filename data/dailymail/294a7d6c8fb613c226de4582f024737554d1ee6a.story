Schools are being forced to raid budgets earmarked for teaching and equipment to pay for Nick Clegg’s free meals pledge.

Headteachers have rubbished claims that the policy is properly funded, saying they have had to dip into existing budgets to provide freezers, ovens and tables.

One head is having to find £10,000 out of his existing budget to fund a fridge to store dozens of free sandwiches. Another is still waiting to hear if a £65,000 kitchen extension will be built.

The government has pledged £2.30 per pupil for free lunches, but heads are complaining the money isn't enough, with one having to use £10,000 out of his existing budget to fund them

There have also been suggestions that schools could be forced to divert so-called ‘pupil premium’ funds – intended to support the poorest pupils – to help fund the scheme.

Mr Clegg has insisted that ‘the resources are there’ for schools to provide free lunches for four to seven-year-olds from September.

But headteachers are coming forward to warn they are having to make deep cuts elsewhere in their budgets to fulfil the duty.

The free meals policy has provoked a fierce row in the Coalition, with Whitehall officials giving the plan a ‘red’ rating over implementation concerns.

The legal requirement for the meals to be hot has also been quietly dropped – meaning that some schools could ditch providing hot meals altogether so they have time to prepare basic cold food for all their pupils.

The warnings from heads will worry Education Secretary Michael Gove, who said in a leaked letter to the Treasury last year that learning budgets must not be used to pay for the policy.

However one head disclosed that even funding cold meals for pupils will take £6,000 from his teaching budget, on top of a £4,000 council grant, to buy a fridge to keep the food cool.

With £50,000 provided to fund the meals themselves, Duncan Churchill, of Mudeford Infants in Dorset, said the policy amounted to ‘£56,000 being spent to give children a sandwich’.

He added: ‘Give me £56,000 to spend in other ways and I could transform the educational chances of children at this school.’

The Government will provide a flat rate of £2.30 for each meal. But Mr Churchill said the figures ‘do not add up’ for his school.

‘£2.30 would not cover a hot service. With the cold service we can just make it work,’ he said.

The Coalition has announced £150million to help schools prepare their cooking facilities, on top of around £1billion to provide the meals themselves.

But Stephen Watkins, head of Mill Field Primary, in Leeds, said he was only receiving 50 per cent of the money he needs to fund new freezers and ovens.

‘I don’t disagree with giving the meals. I do disagree with them saying it’s fully funded,’ he said.

At St Mary Redcliffe Primary in Bristol, a £65,000 kitchen extension is needed but headteacher Emma Payne is still waiting to hear if it will be funded by the local authority.

Two primary schools in Plymouth have also been forced to deny that they were planning to use pupil premium money to fund the meals service.
