The most memorable moments of Joanne Choo's life have all featured 11 secret herbs and spices.

The 29-year-old doctor from the Hills District in Sydney's north-west, has acquired approximately 20 unique KFC buckets since she began her collection 11 years ago.

The mother-to-be is so in love with her prized possessions that they even featured at her wedding in 2012, at her engagement party and photo shoot and at her recent baby shower.

Joanne Choo has been collecting KFC buckets for 11 years and even had them feature at her wedding 

Mrs Choo told Daily Mail Australia that she began collecting the buckets while still at university, simply because 'it just sounded like a good idea at the time', but the habit soon became the means by which she got to know her husband Jonathon.

'We already attended the same church and lead the same youth group where we took people out for KFC and watched cricket together – which has aligned itself with KFC - so it just became part of our story,' she said.

Due to the strong presence of KFC throughout their dating life, including the fast food and her growing bucket collection in their wedding photographs was 'a no brainer', Mrs Choo said.

'On the wedding day, the lunch between the day ceremony and the night reception had to be a quick one, so we thought "of course, KFC!"

The 29-year-old and her husband Jonathon, also had the buckets feature in their engagement photographs 

Mrs Choo, who is currently 36 weeks pregnant, said she chose to cater with KFC at her baby shower

'I'm currently 36 weeks pregnant and on my first week of maternity leave, so at our baby shower we chose to cater with KFC, but also at my farewell party at work – because my colleagues know about my love for KFC - we had KFC then as well.'

All of Mrs Choo's 42 buckets have been acquired by either Mrs Choo or her friends who, after purchasing family feasts, quickly transfer the food to another plate before using the KFC wipes to clean the waxed paper. 

Her favourite is the limited edition KFC fan bucket, which features the faces of 200 fans, including Mrs Chooo herself.

'There's just something special about them releasing different buckets over the years,' Mrs Choo said.

'They have got some very unique ones – I've got the more regular 'finger licking' ones, the James Mcgraw one which was pink, the gold and green one from when The Ashes were on, one which has Pictionary games on the bucket and another fan bucket one associated with cricket,' she said.

However with the arrival of her baby, Mrs Choo revealed she will unfortunately be forced to cull some of her collection.

'My husband has been very good in letting me have a space in the guest room but that's becoming the baby's nursery so I'll probably have to cull the doubles and only keep a unique set,' she said. 

'I have no doubt that it will continue', Mrs Choo said of her collection, 'as long as they keep making new bucket varieties.' 

'But we do only eat KFC on special occasions, it's a special treat for us, not part of our regular weekly diet.' 

The Sydney based doctor ensured she and her husband only eat KFC on special occasions
