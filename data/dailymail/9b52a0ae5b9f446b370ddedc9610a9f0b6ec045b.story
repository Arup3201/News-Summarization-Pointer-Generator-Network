John Sumner, 26, (pictured) was found dead in a wheelie bin in Sunderland, an inquest heard today 

A man was found dead in a wheelie bin after he climbed in following an all-day cocaine and painkiller-fuelled drinking session, an inquest heard.

John Sumner, 26, was found at a recycling centre in Sunderland by workers four days later, as they went to empty the industrial container. 

CCTV footage played at the inquest in to his death today, at Sunderland Coroner's Court, showed Mr Sumner climb into the bin on the morning of June 20 this year.

A post-mortem examination carried out by Dr Jennifer Bolton revealed Mr Sumner had cocaine, diazepam and alcohol in his system.

Dr Bolton told the hearing the cocaine was the most likely cause of his death, as although his body showed signs of injury, they were caused after he had died.

She said: 'With cocaine, it's not a case that the more you take, the more likely you are to die.

'Taking it puts you at risk of sudden death. That's because it has an effect on the heart.'  

The court heard how the 26-year-old, who lived at Lincoln Street in Pallion, Sunderland, had been out on the all-day binge to celebrate a friend's birthday the day before his death.

Following his disappearance, a murder investigation was launched by Northumbria Police. 

Detective sergeant Barbara McGough told the hearing that after interviews with friends and associates of Mr Sumner, his last moments were uncovered.

During the day he became aggressive as he and the group moved on from the Willow Pond pub in Millfield to drink at a house.

The CCTV footage showed Mr Sumner wandering in the back lane of Hylton Road in Sunderland shortly after 7am the following morning.

He then opened the lid of a refuse bin before climbing in.

His body was found by workers at a waste management site in Washington, in Tyne and Wear, on Tuesday, June 24 – four days after he initially climbed in to the bin.

Sunderland coroner Derek Winter recorded a conclusion of misadventure. 

In a statement after the inquest, John's parents John and Liz, and his brother Christopher, who all attended the hearing, said: 'We are devastated at the sudden death of our dear son John.

'We will never come to terms with the tragic events that took place on June 20. However, we have many treasured memories of the 26 years we shared with him.'
