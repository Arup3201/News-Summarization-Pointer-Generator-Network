Scobee. Josh Scobee.

That’s how the Jacksonville Jaguars kicker might introduce himself to a beautiful blonde or buxom brunette at a roulette table.

Although the 32-year-old probably wouldn’t win any James Bond lookalike contests on his own, Scobee might have a shot if he pulled up in his ride. The Aston Martin DBS he drives is similar to the one 007 drove in Casino Royale.

In addition to driving like Bond, Scobee is also cool under pressure.

The Jaguars all-time leading scorer with 984 points, Scobee has kicked seven-game winning field goals during his career - including a 59-yard blast to defeat the Indianapolis Colts in 2010.

As anyone who watched the last NFL game in London between the Atlanta Falcons and Detroit Lions can attest, the difference between winning and losing can all come down to one kick, a reality that Scobee is certainly aware, but not afraid, of.

The 11-year pro played at Wembley last season during Jacksonville’s 42-10 loss to the San Francisco 49ers and he’s more than ready for the international stage once again.

He said: ‘It looks a little slippery but that’s how it was last year. We know what to expect. The Cowboys haven’t played here yet. They’ll find out it’s something different that they’ll have to adjust to.’

‘The footing is going to be different and the elements are different but at the same it’s just snap, hold and kick. We’re doing the same thing, just in a different place.’

‘You have to be focused and take each kick individually. Go into it with the same mindset and confidence level whether you’ve missed the last one or made the last one.’ 

Like James Bond, Scobee is the proud owner of an Aston Martin DB9

Scobee is one of the NFL's most consistent kickers

Scobee has every reason to be confident. He’s made 225 of 279 field goals in his career (80.64 percent) and hit on 23 of 25 attempts (92 per cent) last season. That sort of reliability has made him somewhat of an anchor, albeit an unlikely one, for Jacksonville’s young special teams unit.

However, instead of calling himself a leader, Scobee simply refers to himself as the ‘oldest’. He said: ‘Unfortunately the kicker isn’t always looked at that way. I try to be that person and be responsible for special teams.’

His role as an elder statesman has also made him responsible for advising the younger players about what to do in London, or more specifically, what not to do: ‘Don’t go in strange places around the city where people might not like Americans.’

Despite that advice, Scobee hasn’t had any issues.

‘I’ve been in the city walking around and enjoying the random things in London. We don’t have a lot of this stuff in Jacksonville – all the old traditions.’

‘Meeting people is a lot of fun. The different ways that people talk and the slang they use. You find yourself using a British accent after a little while, or at least trying to. It’s a lot of fun.’

Scobee has also had time for sightseeing. Given his secret agent sensibilities, the destinations have been somewhat predictable.

‘I went to an Aston Martin dealership. Then I went to the London Film Museum and saw all of the Bond cars. That was pretty cool. My favourite was the DB5 from Skyfall. I have a picture of it on my phone somewhere.’

It’s unclear whether the phone he was referring to was supplied by Q.
