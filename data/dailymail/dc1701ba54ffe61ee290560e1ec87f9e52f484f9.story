Waving a placard protesting 'Muslims only guilty of worshipping Allah', this is believed to be Woolwich terror 
suspect Michael Adebolajo, marching with a group that openly called for the 
beheading of British troops.

This new picture shows the radical, now 28, at a Muslims Against Crusaders rally, six years before he and Michael Adebowale, 22, allegedly hacked Drummer Lee Rigby to death.

Dressed in white robes, pointing to the sky and yelling aggressively, he joined dozens who protested outside Paddington Green police station in West London in 2007 after a Muslim extremist was arrested.

The now-banned group became famous after members set fire to poppies on Remembrance Day in 2010, and chanted 'British soldiers burn in hell'.

This new picture, which is almost certainly Adebolajo, raises further questions about how much the security services knew about him.

Pictured: A young man identified as Michael Adebolajo at a Muslims Against Crusaders rally in 2007, a group who had openly called for the beheading of British soldiers

Drama: Hours after the shocking murder, footage emerged of this man with bloodied hands carrying a knife and a machete explaining the reasons for the killing. He has been identified as British Nigerian Michael Adebolajo, who is known by the Muslim name Mujahid

Firebrand cleric Anjem Choudary had links to the group and he admits he first met Adebolajo in 2005 – two years after the alleged terrorist had converted to Islam.

But in the wake of the horrifying Woolwich attack, Choudary has claimed he hadn't seen him for two years.

But despite him being accused of the 
dreadful killing of Lee Rigby 25, he still described Adebolajo as a man 
of 'impeccable character'.

Machinegunner Rigby was hacked to death by two attackers in Woolwich, south-east London on Wednesday at 2.20pm.

Michael
Adebolajo, 28, and his alleged accomplice Michael Adebowale, 22, are 
believed to have run down the off-duty British soldier with a Vauxhall 
Tigra as he walked back to the Woolwich Barracks, crushing his body 
against a road sign.

Witnesses
said the terror suspects then 'hacked and chopped' at his body like 
'crazed animals', before dragging his corpse into the middle of the road
leaving a trail of blood.

Hero: Father Lee Rigby, 25, was executed by two suspected Islamic terrorists in Woolwich on Wednesday afternoon and has prompted calls for a crackdown on dangerous groups

Controversial: Then Muslims Against Crusaders member Emdadur Choudhury (left) was fined £50 fine for burning a poppy and he was supported outside court in 2011 by a group of protesters (right)

Suspect: Michael Adebowale, 22, of Greenwich, south-east London, with a knife in his hand at the scene where Lee Rigby was stabbed to death

As they apparently tried to decapitate him they were chanting: 'this is what God would have wanted'.

A blood-soaked man believed to be Adebolajo, who was still holding a number of weapons in his red-stained hands, then ranted on camera in a clear London accent: 'You people will never be safe. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.'

Within 20 minutes armed officers arrived and the fundamentalists charged at them wielding firearms, knives and a machete.

Police opened fire, taking the pair down with up to eight bullets. The suspects remain under armed guard in two separate London hospitals.

Weapon: This battered car was used to crush the soldier against a sign in front. The streak of blood in front shows how they dragged his body into the street

Picture: This image was the first to emerge on Twitter, showing people close to the soldier's dead body while police hang over the men they have just shot

Response: Radical Anjem Choudary has admitted her knew Adebolajo and called him a 'pleasant, quiet guy'

The new image shows Adebolajo was probably linked to Muslims Against Crusaders.

Home Secretary Theresa May banned the group in November 2011 after it planned to repeat its poppy burning protest.

The first one led to the conviction of Emdadur Choudhury who  laughed at justice as he was handed a 
paltry £50 fine for setting light to poppies on Remembrance Day and 
yelling ‘British soldiers burn in hell’.

After hearing his penalty, which outraged war veterans, he declared: ‘I don’t have any respect for British soldiers, and if they lose a limb or two in Afghanistan then they deserve it. You expect me to feel sorry for them? Of course I don’t.’

Choudhury, from Bethnal Green, East London, was found guilty of using threatening or abusive words or behaviour, and at the time the court heard how he enjoyed benefits including a free council flat and almost £800 a month state handouts.

Although Choudhury sneered that he would have been fined more than £50 for a parking offence, he is refusing to pay. However the bill will be picked up by his ‘good friend’ Anjem Choudary, the notorious firebrand preacher.
