Kremlin agents have contacted American parents trying to overturn the adoption of their 'mentally ill' Russian children, a court heard today.

Judge Edward McCarty accused Moscow of attempted 'intimidation' as he revealed the New York parents had been contacted by Russian representatives.

Their lawyer revealed that the parents in the case had been left in a 'state of fright' when they received the call on their unlisted phone number.

The judge also disclosed that he had been contacted by the Russians.

He said he would 'not be intimidated' and that Russia should respect international law and stop sending him letters.

Banned: Judge McCarty, the surrogate justice for Nassau County also made what is thought to be an unprecedented ruling banning any adoptions under his jurisdiction that have been arranged over the Internet.

Case: A Long Island couple has asked a judge to void the adoption of their Russian-born children because they suffer from serious mental disorders.

Russia's children's rights commissioner Pavel Astakhov a key aide to Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin. He told Moscow's diplomats to demand access to two Russian children adopted in the US whose parents want to overturn the adoption, claiming the boy and girl are mentally ill.

The case now threatens to blow up into a diplomatic row at a time when relations between Russia and the US are already at a historic low - although there were some signs of a thaw between the two country's presidents this week.

Russia's Children's Rights Commissioner Pavel Astakhov has already called the parents ‘despicable’ and ‘mentally ill’ - and today one of the lawyers demanded that he be more ‘temperate’ in his comments. 

At the hearing Judge McCarty, the surrogate justice for Nassau County also made what is thought to be an unprecedented ruling banning any adoptions under his jurisdiction that have been arranged over the Internet. 

He hit out during the case of a mother and father who want to void their adoption of two girls from Russia in 2008 via major American adoption agencies Cradle of Hope and Spence-Chapin.

They claim they were victims of a ‘bait and switch’ scheme because the children later developed severe mental health problems which they were never told about which got so bad the youngsters threatened to kill them.

They also claim that the children they ended up with might not even be the ones the originally asked for and may have been sexually abused. 

The children, now 12 and 14, are currently in a New York state facility.

They were not identified in court and were referred to as ‘Child A’ and ‘Child C’ whilst the parents were known as ‘PF’ and PM’.

Today Judge McCarty made public a letter sent last month by the Consulate General of the Russian Federation in New York in which he demanded ‘detailed information on the case’.

The letter, signed by consul general Igor Golubovskiy, said that he had been contacted by the Russian embassy to the US in Washington and that they wanted updates too.

In his reply letter, which he also made public, Judge McCarty refused to hand over any documents and asked that they come to court like everyone else - a representative of the Russian Federation was said to be at the latest hearing although they did not identify themselves.

Team: Peter Kelly, the lawyer for the siblings, is among the legal representatives in court today in Nassau County

Venue: Nassau County's surrgate court sat at the county court house in Mineola, Long Island, New York today

Chill to relations: Vladimir Putin and Barack Obama appeared to be on better terms when they met in Beijing this week at a summit for Asia-Pacific leaders but the judge's comments suggest tensions between the Kremlin and the USA

He also told Mr Golubovskiy that he is ‘fully familiar’ with international law and points out that he has ‘served in various capacities in American Embassies in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Albania, Slovenia and Haiti’.

Furthermore, he adds, he ‘attended the World Court and the International Criminal Court at The Hague.’

Judge McCarty signs off by telling the Russian consul general that only when the case is over will he be prepared to discuss the matter further.

MailOnline first disclosed that Vladimir Putin's children's commissioner had weighed into the row over the children on 30 October.

Pavel Astakhov called for immediate access to the children and said he had asked Russia's diplomats to intervene.

'They remain two underage citizens of Russian Federation,' he said.

'They are protected by our laws. The Russian consul has a right to meet them, to access them. This is what must be done right now - to get access to these children.

'This is what the Russian Consulate in New York must be occupied with now - to meet and chat with them.  

'There is little chance to bring them back to Russia. The Americans will not give them away. The children can go back only when they reach the right age and make such a decision.'

Astakhov also accused the parents of 'covering their inconsistency by blaming the poor children, who have already been placed in a psychiatric clinic. This is despicable'.

He claimed the children have been labelled and are imprisoned in mental institutions. 'This is deceit,' he said.

'They want not merely to surrender the children, they are seeking to cancel adoption, alleging the children's diagnoses were somehow concealed from them,' said Astakov.

'This is utter nonsense,' he said. 'The American couple had a complete dossier on each child and had the right to consult any doctor. They could have sought additional medical opinions if they had wished.'

In a long statement to the court the judge then explained the extent of Russia’s tampering in the case.

He said: ‘This court has learned that there have been contacts by a representative of the Russian Federation with the petitioners in regard to this matter. These contacts have left these adoptive parents in a state of fright.

‘Conduct by the Russian Federation has affected this litigation....inadvertent or intentional Russian Federation conduct will not intimidate this court, judge or litigants to bar public knowledge to the sensitive issues presented in this matter.

‘Under International Law any contact between the Russian Federation diplomatic corps and local political institutions is inappropriate. Any such contacts should be through the United States Department of State. The Russian Federation cites International Law in their letter to this court and I urge them to follow it’.

The parents were not in court but were represented by their attorney Thomas Rice who said that Russia was trying to be an ‘interloper’.

He described the case as an 'entirely tragic situation' and said the mother and father they were going through 'indescribable pain'.

Mr Rice said that the Russian adoption agencies, who he called 'agents of the Russian Federation', were able to identify his clients and get their unlisted telephone number to their total shock.

He said that as a result their privacy had been 'violated' and that they were 'subject to intimidation and fear by the breach of confidentiality'.

Referring to his description of his clients as by the Russians as of as 'despicable', Mr Rice said: ‘I would request that the Russian Minister of state for children be more temperate in his comments'.

The case has provoked a debate in the US and strong criticism of the parents by some, but Mr Rice said this was 'scurrilous' and 'disrespectful' with no basis in reality.

Judge McCarty also praised the parents and said there was ‘not an iota of proof’ that they had victimized the girls.

He passed his law banning internet adoptions in Nassau County because he said he believes the process is so unregulated it amounts to ‘human trafficking’.

His ruling bans any adoptions organised through the Web or via any ‘unofficial adoption programme’ that is not affiliated to the state.

Those who disobey it could be fined or thrown in jail for contempt.

Judge McCarty said: ‘Today marks a court attempt to regulate the rehoming / unofficial adoptive trade in adoptive children.

Correspondence: The official letter from the Russian consul-general in New York. But the country's agents also contacted the parents in the case on their unlisted telephone number

Robust reply: The judge's response to the consul-general. He warned Russian authorities today that he would not be intimidated

Banning order: Judge McCarty has forbidden any adoptions via the internet going ahead in Nassau County in this order, published today

‘This is a first step. I urge other state adoption courts as well as state legislators and federal legislators to take suitable actions to regulate this aspect of the adoption process.’

Judge McCarty adjourned the case until December when he will decide if he will continue to hear it in open court. Most adoption cases are held in private.

He said he feels that the ‘integrity of the American adoption agencies...has been called into question’ and the allegations of fraud claimed by the parents were so ‘disturbing’ they should be heard in public.

Mr Rice, Peter Kelly, the lawyer for the children, the adoption agencies and Nassau County social services all want it held behind closed doors.

Mr Kelly told the court that earlier in the day he had visited the girls at their facility and that he was ‘satisfied’ they were being looked after properly.

Last year Russian President Vladimir Putin banned Americans from adopting Russian children in what was seen as a return of Cold War style diplomatic tit for tat.

Before that, in the past 30 years some 60,000 children had been adopted by Americans from Russia as part of an industry worth $330 million.
