If Lewis Hamilton wins the world championship, he can send the cheque to me, c/o of the Daily Mail.For,
 lo and behold, his bulldogs Roscoe and Coco have been confined to 
kennels. They will not be here at the Spanish Grand Prix, on the 
instruction, it is said, of Niki Lauda, his boss at Mercedes.

We
 remember the cries of criticism when we gently nudged him to the view 
that going around with a couple of dogs was not the sort of thing that a
 first-rank sportsman did. Leave them at home, we urged, for your own 
good.

So
 indignant were Mercedes at the comment - well-intentioned though it was
 - that they banned this newspaper from Hamilton’s press briefings.

But here, ahead of the Spanish Grand Prix, the fifth race of a season that Hamilton is dominating with the brilliance of his driving, this admission came.

‘The first load of races (Australia, Malaysia, Bahrain, China) were just so far for the dogs to travel.

‘I imagine it’s a bit than having kids to move around - all these jabs you have to get the dogs, the passports. It’s just been simpler to have them with my family. At the moment, it’s just me and my trainer.’

The one-eyed Lewis fans saw the suggestion that he keep his dogs at home as some serious insult. It was not. It was a suggestion made to help the most talented driver of his generation - the fastest driver in the world, possibly of all time - at a time when his then then new team, Mercedes, exercised no control over him to his own detriment.

Had Lewis’s father, Anthony, been in control of him there is no way he would have countenanced the notion of dogs being carted around the world as if they were Louis Vuitton luggage.

It is a firm belief here that Hamilton’s 
behaviour last year was a transitional phase: he was trying to find out 
who he was after years in the narrow tunnel of McLaren’s tutelage and 
his father’s massively controlling influence.

Mercedes hailed the 
extravagance of Lewis’s behaviour as a sign of his greater maturity. It 
was not. It was his rebellion against a strait-jacket.

What we see 
now in Hamilton this year - 12 months and more after his move from 
McLaren to Mercedes - is perhaps getting close to a settled position. He
 is freer of mind and more relaxed in his own skin.

Hamilton is doing
 what he has always done: drive sensationally well. But despite having 
won the last three races, he is trailing Nico Rosberg by four points. A 
mechanical failure at the first race in Australia cost him in the 
standings.

He was brilliantly dominant again on Friday in practice. 
He was fastest in both sessions, on the first time occasion nine-tenths 
of a second ahead of Jenson Button’s McLaren and then half a second in 
front of his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg.

‘It’s been a great day 
today and I’m happy to be back in the car after what feels like quite a 
long break,’ he said. ‘I can feel the positive step forward that we’ve 
made with the car, so a big thank you to everyone back at our factories 
for all of their hard work since China.

‘I’ve not had such a good 
Friday for a very long time. It’s very difficult to overtake in 
Barcelona so we will do everything we can to qualify as high as possible
 tomorrow. Position is everything.

‘But really it is all about the 
race and looking after those tyres. Finally, it’s great to see so many 
fans here today enjoying the action in this beautiful weather.’

After 
his blazing start, Button slipped back to sixth fastest in the 
afternoon, his McLaren less than wonderful.

He said: ‘The afternoon 
was where we expected to be. This morning was good and we were quicker 
than expected. I don’t think it’s anywhere near as good as it looked 
earlier.

‘This morning we looked a lot quicker, maybe because of 
temperatures and fuel loads.’

Never mind fuel loads, or indeed anything 
else. Unless Lewis Hamilton’s Mercedes blows up, he is on for victory 
here. The dog-less star is simply way, way, way ahead of everyone.
