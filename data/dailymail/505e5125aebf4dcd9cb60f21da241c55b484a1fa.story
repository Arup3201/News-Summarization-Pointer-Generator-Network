The family of a marathon cyclist murdered by a deranged homeless man have told how he went out of his way to help destitute people.

Kevin Adorno was biking from Maryland to Miami, where he planned to propose to his girlfriend, when he was stabbed outside a McDonald's in Vero Beach, Florida.

As his family and friends gathered to celebrate his life, Kevin's eldest brother John told MailOnline: 'He used to go to a bar where there was a homeless guy and he not only knew his name, every time he went there he bought the guy a hot dog.

Soul mates: Kevin Adorno, 28, and Elyse Fuggetta, 26, met three years ago at his cousin's wedding and he immediately wooed her with a big bouquet of flowers, his family tells MailOnline. The couple were meeting up in Miami and he was just two hours away when he made the fatal pit stop at McDonald's 

Life cycle: Kevin, who was stabbed to death by a homeless man, when he made a pit stop at a McDonald's in Vero Beach, Florida. He embraced life and loved talking to people he met on his road trips, says his eldest brother John Adorno.  If the guy who attacked him had needed something, Kevin would have given it to him'

Sealed with a kiss: 'The engagement ring he picked out was in his pocket,' said Kevin's sister, Tanya Adorno

'That's the sort of person Kevin was. He'd give you his last cigarette, his last dollar.

'He embraced life and he loved talking to people he met on the road. If the guy who attacked him had needed something, Kevin would have given it to him.'

The 28-year-old artist, who ran his own graphic design business in Unionville, Connecticut, had stopped off to grab food when he was attacked by 59-year-old Rene Herrera Cruz on Monday night.

Kevin was chatting on the phone to his soon-to-be fiancé Elyse Fuggetta when the seemingly random stabbing happened.

Elyse, 26, told police that the phone suddenly went dead. Kevin managed to stagger back into McDonalds bleeding from several stab wounds before collapsing. He was pronounced dead shortly afterwards

His sister Tanya, 29, told MailOnline how her romantic brother was secretly planning to propose to Elyse once he reached Miami.

'The engagement ring he had picked out was in his pocket,' she said. 'The only person who knew about it was our mother.

'Along the route he spotted another antique set of rings. He took a photograph and texted mom to see what she thought. She told him to stick with his original choice.

'Elyse was going to join him on the final leg of the ride, 20 miles from Miami. She didn't know it but that's when he planned to propose to her.

'He was a big romantic with Elyse. They met three years ago at our cousin's wedding and immediately afterwards he wooed her with a big bouquet of flowers.

'Their relationship was instantaneous. They both knew they'd met THE one. She completed him.

'Elyse is just distraught. She is too upset to even speak. They loved each other so much.

'Kevin was the baby of our family. The youngest of four and we called him Kevino Bambino. Yet he looked after all of us.

Loving feeling: 'Elyse is distraught. She is too upset to even speak. They loved each other so much,' said Tanya

'I remember he was even romantic with his own family. On Valentine's Day as a teenager I would find a single flower on my windshield. It was always from Kevin. He wanted me to know I was loved.

'He embraced life and had a bucket list of things he wanted to do.

'Last year we were invited to a wedding in Maryland. He decided to cycle there and invited me to join him.

'We set off from my home in Maine and cycled slowly down the coast, stopping every two to three hours. It was an amazing experience. I've driven that route by car many times yet you see it differently from a cycle.

'The world looks very different from the bike saddle and Kevin wanted to carry on and do the entire East Coast trip.

'He set off in mid August and called us all every night from the road.

'Kevin was full of great stories about the people he met. He just loved to talk to people.

'We're getting texts and messages from all sorts of people he met on his road trip.'

Tanya and Kevin, along with older brothers John, 33, and Robert, 31, grew up in the pretty New England town of Farmington embracing their dad Angelo's Italian heritage and mother Helena's Polish roots.

Happy:  Playful Kevin was crazy about soccer and taught his nephews a few tricks, Tanya said. 'They know how to kick a ball about because of Kevin'

'He was crazy about soccer and taught his nephews a few tricks,' Tanya said. 'They know how to kick a ball about because of Kevin.

'His big love, aside from Elyse and us, was his boxer dog Juve – that's short for Juventus, the Italian soccer club he supported.'

Their 60-year-old father was on vacation in Sicily when Kevin died. Last night he was returning to the US to bury his baby son.

'We're planning a non-traditional ceremony for Kevin,' his brother John said. 'We don't know what yet but it will be something different because that's what Kevin would have wanted.

'Tonight we have a fire pit in the back yard – Kevin loved a fire pit, he always wanted to build the biggest and the best.

'He wasn't competitive, he just enjoyed doing things. It wasn't about winning or doing things best, he just wanted everyone to enjoy themselves.

'Killer': Rene Herrera Cruz, 59, told police he saw Adorno looking at him before making a phone call and thought he was instructing people to kill him. He admitted to stabbing Adorno in the chest and arm, police said

Remembrance: Last night the family had the fire pit in the back yard glowing in Kevin's honor. Kevin loved a fire pit, he always wanted to build the biggest and the best

'Kevin definitely had a bucket list of things to do. He loved a challenge and cycling the East Coast was one of those challenges.

'The tragedy is that Kevin would have wanted to help the homeless man who attacked him.

'As far as I know, they didn't have a conversation. This man was mentally ill and thought Kevin was taking photos of him or something. He just attacked him.

'The police knew about him. They'd had problems with him the night before at a Burger King. He shouldn't have been on the streets.

'Kevin was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.'
