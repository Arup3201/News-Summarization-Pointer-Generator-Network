A migration agent who has been banned for five years after he allegedly groomed a client to act gay so that he had more chance of getting an Australian visa has vowed to clear his name.

Sydney based lawyer Issam Sam Issa is reported to have taken a wannabe migrant to Oxford Street and Kings Cross, areas of the city popular with the gay community, and advised him to tell a tribunal that he was homosexual.

However, Mr Issa told Daily Mail Australia he is launching an appeal with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against the Migration Agents Registration Authority's ruling.

‘I obviously deny that allegation,’ Mr Issa said, highlighting that he believes the whole story has not been told.

His solicitor Adrian Joel added: ‘We are preparing an appeal urgently. We are beyond appalled by the nature of the allegations that have been presented, they are gravely defamatory.’

In a court appearance, involving a man who wanted to live in Australia named Mr E, it was alleged that Mr Issa ‘advised and assisted him to apply for a protection visa based on fabricated claims of being homosexual’.

To support the claims for his visa application, Mr E claimed that Mr Issa took him to Oxford Street and Kings Cross.

The client was interviewed by the Migration Agents Registration Authority on 17 December 2012.

However, Mr Issa stated that Mr E’s complaint was motivated by personal gain. 

In another tribunal involving a man named as Mr C, it was also alleged Mr Issa advised him to apply for a protection visa based on fraudulent claims of being homosexual. 

In other complaints about the migration agent, protection visas were also lodged on religious grounds.

Eight complaints were made against the migration agent by his clients, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, the Refugee Review Tribunal and the NSW Legal Services Commissioner

MARA said in total they received eight complaints about the agent’s conduct and the immigration assistance he provided to protection visa applicants between November 2011 to June 2013.

These complaints were from individual clients, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, the Refugee Review Tribunal and the NSW Legal Services Commissioner.

‘The complaints alleged that the agent encouraged and assisted his clients to lodge applications for Protection visas with claims that were fabricated,’ a ruling on the MARA website says.

In response to an official warning notice from MARA, Mr Issa said ‘there is no evidence to substantiate the allegations of fraud’.

He also claimed the alleged ‘unusual similarities’ attached to the homosexual lifestyle of his visa applicants ‘do not establish any element of causation of fraud’.

In some cases he called his clients ‘self-confessed liars’ and questioned the validity of their claims against him.

Mr Issa first registered as a migration agent on 9 February 1995 and records show he mainly practices in relation to Protection visas.

Protection visas allow migrants to live and work in Australia as a permanent resident but to qualify for them you must be a refugee as defined by the Refugees Convention.  

Or you may also meet the Complementary Protection criteria in the Australian Migration Act 1958.

In some countries being gay is a crime and thus homosexuals can be granted refugee status in Australia if they face persecution in their home countries.

For example, in Uganda this year the president approved a new law that imposes life sentences for homosexuality; he also made it a crime to fail to report someone for breaking the new law.

Protection visas lodged inside Australia cost $35 and are far cheaper than other visas, such as a Skilled Migration Visa which starts at $3250. 

To be granted a Protection visa you need to be either a refugee as defined by the Refugees Convention:

Refugees Convention: 

The term ‘refugee’ is defined  as a person who owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.

Or you must meet the Complementary Protection criteria in the Australian Migration Act 1958:  

Circumstances where there are substantial grounds for believing that, as a necessary and foreseeable consequence of a non-citizen’s removal from Australia to a receiving country, there is a real risk the non-citizen will suffer significant harm.

The MARA investigated a sample of Mr Issa’s client, departmental and tribunal files – a total of 73 files - and found ‘a pattern of poor practices which breached the Code of Conduct’.

‘The Office of the MARA found that the agent prepared and submitted applications containing generalised information not supported by instructions from his clients; he included misleading and inaccurate statements to enhance the prospects of success of the visa applications; and failed to provide frank and candid advice to his clients about the prospects of success of their visa applications.

‘As a result of the investigation the Office of the MARA was satisfied that the agent had breached multiple provisions of the Code of Conduct and was not a person of integrity, and not a fit and proper person to give immigration assistance,’ the ruling states.
