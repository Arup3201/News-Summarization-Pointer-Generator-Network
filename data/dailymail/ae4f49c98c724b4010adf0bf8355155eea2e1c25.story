Chelsea midfielder Marco van Ginkel has changed his mind and agreed to join AC Milan on loan.

The young Holland midfielder had told the Italians he wanted to stay at Stamford Bridge and fight for his place.

But with his chances looking limited he has decided Milan would be the next best step for his career.

Chelsea were always receptive to allowing Dutch midfielder Van Ginkel out on loan as he needs games following his cruciate ligament injury last year.

Milan were poised to complete a second signing from Chelsea late on Monday, confirming that midfielder Marco van Ginkel had arrived in the city.

'Dutch midfielder Marco Van Ginkel arrived at the Milan-Linate Airport at 22.40 local time,' the club said on their website.

No details about his move were given, but it is expected the 21-year-old will join on a season-long loan.
