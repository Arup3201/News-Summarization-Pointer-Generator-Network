It's a boy: Nancy Gonzalez, who became pregnant with an inmate's baby, has given birth to a son

A prison guard accused of having a sexual relationship with an inmate who killed two New York City policemen has given birth to a son.

Nancy Gonzalez's attorney told the New York Daily News his client delivered the baby Thursday night on Long Island.

Gonzalez was charged in February with having an unlawful sexual relationship with inmate Ronell Wilson while working at a federal detention center in Brooklyn.

At the time her attorney said Gonzalez has had a tragic life and made poor decisions.

Wilson was convicted in the point-blank shootings of undercover officers James Nemorin and Rodney Andrews in a 2006 gun sting.

He initially was sentenced to death, but his sentence was overturned on appeal.

Gonzalez was excused from a court date in New York on Wednesday due to labor contractions, her attorney Anthony Ricco told the court.

The former Metropolitan Detention Center guard was charged with having unlawful sex with an inmate and later failed a drugs test, admitting she had taken cocaine to deal with the stress of her arrest.

Gonzales is facing 15 years in prison after being arrested on suspicion that she
had hatched a plot with Ronnell Wilson to help save his life.

The convicted killer
allegedly impregnated Gonzales to avoid the death penalty and had been so desperate to father a child
that he offered to confess to the murders of two detectives, according to his
former lawyer.

Attorney Ephraim Savitt said that in 2006, his then-client
Ronell Wilson was poised to accept a plea deal as part of which he would accept
responsibility for the 2003 slayings of undercover detectives Rodney Andrews
and James Nemorin and be sentenced to a life in prison.

Explanation: Gonzalez allegedly said in a recorded phone conversation that she was 'vulnerable' when she decided to start a relationship with Wilson in a bid to give him some 'hope'

'Wilson advised me that he would take the life deal - as
long as he could have conjugal visits - because he was determined to leave this
earth with a child of his own, to give his wasted life some meaning,' Savitt
told the New York Post.

For Wilson to be 
allowed to meet with women behind
bars, he would have had to be sent to a state prison, but his former 
attorney
said that the negotiations with the prosecution never went that far 
because Attorney general Alberto Gonzalez rejected the proposed 
agreement.

Gonzalez was arrested on 
charges she intentionally had sex with Ronell Wilson while working the 
night shift at the Metropolitan Detention Center, which is against the 
law.

She became pregnant in June, a few months into the affair, 
according to court papers.

On her Facebook page, Gonzalez posted
a photo last month depicting herself proudly showing off her swollen 
pregnant belly in a tight yellow T-shirt with the world 'Love' printed 
across the front.

Legal complications: Wilson's death sentence was thrown out after an appeals court found that a prosecutor had vilified the convicted killer

Wilson was found guilty in December 
2006 of shooting detectives James Nemorin, 36, and Rodney Andrews, 34, 
in the back of their heads in a car March 10, 2003 in Staten Island.

The
following year, he was sentenced to death, making him the first federal
defendant in New York to face capital punishment since 1954.

However,
an appeals court reversed the sentence in 2010 claiming than a 
prosecutor violated Wilson's constitutional rights by making him out to 
be a villain. 

A new jury must decide his fate. But 
replay of the trial's penalty phase has been put off as Wilson's lawyers
seek to convince a judge that he's ineligible for the death penalty 
because he is mentally disabled.

Military career: Before taking a job as a federal corrections officer, Gonzalez served in the U.S. Army

Gonzales was taken into custody at her Long Island home. She could face 15 years in prison if convicted.

According
to a complaint, Wilson and Gonzales' scheme to help the convicted 
killer escape capital punishment was revealed by prison informants.

One inmate said he witnessed the female guard moving away 
from Wilson's cell door while he was standing there with his pants down.

CBS New York stated that the inmate and guard had sex in a vacant activity room while Gonzalez was supposed to be checking up on prisoners.

The two were caught on video talking or hours at her desk in the kitchen.

The corrections officer came clean 
about her affair with Wilson, which lasted between March and August 
2012, in a taped phone conversation with her boyfriend, who is serving 
time in a state prison.

'I can’t explain it. I know what’s to
come. I know what is going to be said about me,' Gonzalez allegedly 
said. 'I know that for me as a parent, how am I going to explain this to
this little boy?

‘I
took a chance because I was so vulnerable and wanted to be loved and 
now I am carrying his child.'
