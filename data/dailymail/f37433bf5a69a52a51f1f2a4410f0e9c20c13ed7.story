Felipe Massa said he was ‘screaming’ for the Japanese Grand Prix to be stopped in the laps leading up to Jules Bianchi’s crash.

Bianchi is undergoing surgery after sustaining a serious head injury in a collision with a recovery vehicle sent out to retrieve Adrian Sutil’s  Sauber.

Sutil lost control of his car as the rain intensified during the closing stages of Sunday’s incident-fuelled race.

 On lap 42, Adrian Sutil lost control of his car, spun and hit the tyre barrier on the outside of Turn 7. The marshals displayed double waved yellow flags before the corner to warn drivers of the incident. A recovery vehicle was despatched in order to lift the car and take it to a place of safety behind the guardrail. While this was being done the driver of car 17, Jules Bianchi, lost control of his car, travelled across the run-off area and hit the back of the tractor.

Once the marshals reported that the driver was injured, medical teams were despatched and the Safety Car was deployed. These were followed by an extrication team and an ambulance.

The driver was removed from the car, taken to the circuit medical centre and then by ambulance to Mie General Hospital.

The CT scan shows that he has suffered a severe head injury and he is currently undergoing surgery. Following this he will be moved to intensive care where he will be monitored.

Mie General Hospital will issue an update as soon as further information becomes available.

Bianchi then hit the recovery truck despatched to collect his stricken Sauber on the following lap.

The race was red-flagged on lap 46 with Lewis Hamilton claiming his third consecutive win to extend his lead in the championship over Nico Rosberg, who finished second, to 10 points.

‘I’m very worried,’ said Massa, who was running in seventh when the race was stopped with seven laps remaining.

‘I was already screaming on the radio five laps before the safety car that there was too much water on the track, but they took a bit too long and it was dangerous.’

Bianchi, 25, was taken to Mie University Hospital, 10 miles from the Suzuka circuit, under a police escort. He will be taken to intensive care after his emergency surgery. 

'It's been an interesting weekend,' said race-winner Hamilton, who claimed his third successive victory.

'Our first thoughts go to Jules - it overshadows everything else when one of our colleagues is injured and we are praying for him. Next to this, the race result doesn't seem significant at all.

'Generally the car was absolutely fantastic through the race and once I passed Nico I was able to really manage the gap and enjoy the ride. Obviously it didn't finish the way we would have hoped but really, my prayers are with Bianchi and his family.'

Rosberg, who could not convert an eighth pole position of the season into the win which would have put him top of the standings, conceded Hamilton had been better than him on the day.

'Congratulations to Lewis for winning today,' he said. 'Of course my thoughts at the moment are with our colleague Jules because it seems quite serious, so I really wish him all the best.'
