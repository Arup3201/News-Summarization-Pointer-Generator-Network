A U.S company has created a personal robotic bartender that it claims 'serves the perfect drink' to suit an individual's tastes.

Monsieur is an artificially intelligent robotic that can learn its user's favourite cocktails as well as how strong they like them - and even anticipate when to include a double shot of alcohol if they have had an especially trying day at work.

The robot is the brainchild of a company, also called Monsieur, in Atlanta, Georgia, which is trying to raise $100,000 on crowd-funding website Kickstarter to put the product, which is designed for the home, into production.

The artificially intelligent robot called Monsieur, can create thousands of drinks at the touch of a button and learns how a user likes them - even anticipating when to make a drink with a double shot of alcohol in it after a long day at work

To use the machine, which the company envisions being installed in a house, an individual must use the touch screen on the robot to browse the 300-strong cocktail list and choose how strong they could like their drink, from 'lightweight' to 'boss'.

Over time, the company says its intelligent machine will learn an individual's taste to automatically per-adjust their drinks, as well as making them to order.

The firm also says that just like a skilled human bartender, its robot can make recommendations based on their preferences and homeowners can pick a theme for their machine from Irish pub to Hawaiian tiki bar.

Each of the 12 themes comprises 25 cocktails and Monsieur claims to be able to make 150 drinks without needing to top up on booze.

However, when the ingredients do run out, the robot can send an email or text message to a local store to order more.

Using its 'personal butler feature' the robot can tap into a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connection to know when its owner is at home.

If they have a date scheduled, it can offer the man or woman a matching cocktail, or even mix a chosen celebratory tipple if its owner's favourite sports team wins a fixture.

Owners of the bar-meets-bartender can use a smartphone app to order a drink remotely so it is ready when they get home, or if they don't want to move from the sofa.

The company wrote on its Kickstarter page: 'We envision a world where Monsieurs are 
in nightclubs, arena suites, hotels and offices and many other places 
where you enjoy cocktails and they will recognise who you are and your
preferences via your mobile app.'

At the time of writing, Monsieur has raised $70,500 of its $100,000 target on Kickstarter, but so far no businesses have snapped up a $10,000 package for three machines plus extras to make them one of the first establishments to have the robotic barman.

The company already has an industrial-scale machine that serves drinks inaÂ  number of bars in Atlanta.
