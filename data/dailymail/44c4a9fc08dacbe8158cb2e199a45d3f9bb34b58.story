Cambridge University has long been regarded as one of the most prestigious academic institutions in the world.

However, historians have exposed the seedy underbelly of the acclaimed university - with tales of adultery, libel, bribery and even murder.

Records from the university's Vice-Chancellor's Court, dating from the 16th and 17th centuries, show it was a school for scandal.

Elite: Cambridge University has long been regarded as one of the most prestigious academic institutions in the world. However, historians have exposed the seedy underbelly of the acclaimed university - with tales of adultery, bribery and even murder

The court, which laid down the law, was called to adjudicate on horrific crimes such as murder and the beating of women until 'blacke and blewe'.

Newly-catalogued archives also show frequent claims of men falsely being taunted for being a cuckold - a husband with an adulterous wife - and the birth of illegitimate children.

In 1595, William Covell, a fellow of Queens' College, was accused of having an affair with married Bridget Edmunds.

The court summoned servants and neighbours as witnesses and Edmunds' maid reported seeing the pair being 'naughte together'.

Adjudication: The university's Proctor, who administered justice in the 16th century

Covell was described as 'blusteringe and bloweing verie much and afterwards verie redd in the face' and she 'bare-legged without anie hosen on and havinge her petticate not laced'.

Shamed Edmunds eventually confessed that Covell was the father of her unborn child.

She was made to give a public acknowledgement of her guilt in St Botolph's church on three successive Sundays - dressed in a white sheet and holding a white staff.

Another record from 1603 tells how John Dighton, of St Catharine's Hall, sued the college butler for calling him 'a turd in his teeth' - a common insult of the period.

In 1625, Kenelm Mainwairing, of St John's College, and his wife Mary brought a case against Jeremy Chace, of Christ's College, for calling Mary a 'scurvy queane'.

Three years earlier, Carrier Thomas Hobson, of Hobson's choice fame, had been sued by a disgruntled employee called Rooke for non-payment of wages.

Hobson then alleged Rooke was a thief who had mistreated horses and allowed them to 'gott loose' while he sloped off to an ale house.

And he accused him of picking up a girl on the London to Cambridge road who had fallen from the wagon and died.

Rooke was condemned as 'contumacious' and his arrest was ordered four times, but he eluded justice.

The historic cases have been publicised for the first time after archivists finished cataloguing the thousands of pages of old university records.

University archivist Jacky Cox, who 
spent a year on the project, said the issues the court dealt with were 
'deathly serious to the status-conscious society of the time'.

Offenders could be imprisoned or subjected to corporal punishment for major crimes, or suspended from their degrees.

Insulting: An excerpt from Cambridge University's crime records which shows John Dighton, of St Catharine's Hall, taking legal action against the college butler for calling him 'a turd in his teeth'

'The court records provide a vivid insight into the social and economic history of Cambridge, beyond the academic life of the university, as the inhabitants of this small market town, town alongside gown, lived and died, traded, worshipped, fell out and made up under the auspices of the university authorities,' she said.

The Chancellor's Court was presided over by the Vice-Chancellor from the sixteenth century.

It accrued wide-ranging civil, criminal and ecclesiastical powers from successive monarchs.

The court tried cases affecting university members and other 'privileged persons' - townspeople such as stationers, tailors or butchers trading with university members.

For lesser misdemeanoursm students and townsfolk would face fines, bonds for good behaviour or public apology.
