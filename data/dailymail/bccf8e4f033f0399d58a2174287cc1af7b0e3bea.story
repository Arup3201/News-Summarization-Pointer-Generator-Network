A pensioner has died after being violently attacked during a robbery at his home.

Frank Worsley, 87, was woken up by a man who broke into his Bolton home in the early hours of August 3 and was robbed and beaten.

The Second World War veteran was taken to hospital after suffering a stroke and a bleed on the brain but he died on Tuesday afternoon.

Frank Worsley has died after being beaten and robbed in his own home in Bolton. He is pictured with his wife Mary, who died last year. They were married for 62 years

His wife of 62 years, Mary, passed away in September last year having suffered with Multiple Scoliosis.

Mr Worsley’s family paid tribute to the loving grandfather and father-of-two.

A statement said: 'Frank was a loving father to Steven and Catherine, grandfather to Karen and Michael. He was also a father-in-law, brother-in-law and a friend to many.

'Frank fought in WWII. He was in the Royal Navy Medical Corps and had written about his time on board various war ships, giving his family a snippet of how life was during the war.

'He was an all-round good guy. Frank was very popular in the community and would chat and help out anybody he could. He will be sadly missed by his family and friends.'

Greater Manchester Police called the death 'devastating' and are still appealing for witnesses. File picture

The statement also detailed his love of the stage, and how he loved performing with an amateur operatics group at St Marks Church.

He also founded the church's youth club  and was a Sunday school teacher at another church. On top of these activities he found time to regularly speak at the local Women's Institute on various subjects.

A neighbour, who asked not to be named, told the Bolton News: 'I have lived on the road for 13 years and I have known him for as long as I have lived here.

'He used to say hello when he was taking his wife Mary, who used a wheelchair, out for walks. He was lovely, he was a very proud man and always had time to talk to children.

'He knew my son liked animals so at Christmas he would come around with goodies, bags of books and other things for my little boy.'

A post-mortem will take place today to determine the exact cause of death.

Police are appealing for witnesses.

Andy Tattersall from Greater Manchester Police said: 'Our thoughts and sympathies go out to Frank’s family at this devastating time for them, after he sadly passed away in hospital yesterday.

'We will do all we can to support them. Our investigation into this case is ongoing and we are appealing for anyone who may have seen a suspicious person or vehicle in the Longfield Road area of Bolton in the early hours of Saturday, August 3, to contact us.'

Daniel Crompton, 24, of no fixed address, has been charged with robbery and will appear at Bolton Crown Court tomorrow.
