He may be the grandson of President Richard Nixon, but it was Christopher Nixon Cox's wife who has drawn all the attention during their recent trip to China.

Andrea Catsimatidis, 23, wore a eye-catching bright red dress, stealing the spotlight from her husband, whom she married in 2011.

The couple met when Catsimatidis was just shy of her 18th birthday, and a student at New York City's prestigious Hewitt School, in 2008.

Nixon Cox, who was working for the 
John McCain campaign at the time, admits that he was enchanted by the 
much younger beauty immediately.

In China, Nixon Cox's bride - donning
at least two bright red, figure-hugging frocks - stole the show, but it
came with some unwanted attention of the country's internet trolls.

One internet commenter, according to 
the International Business Times, posted to Chinese microblogging site 
Weibo: 'Can we make sure she isn’t an inflatable doll?'

Another more direct critique came as a user posted: 'Is that woman's super-large chest real!?'

One more chimed in: 'Sorry, but your wife looks like a porn star.'

Nixon Cox visited China to 
commemorate the 1972 trip by his grandfather, the first time a U.S. 
president journeyed to the Far East.

His wife is the daughter of John 
Catsimatidis, a billionaire supermarket tycoon from Greece - and current
New York City mayoral candidate.

The elder Catsimatidis is the CEO of the Red Apple Group, and owns the Gristedes supermarket chain.

Their first dates included a trip to a
bakery in Manhattan's West Village neighborhood, and to a presidential 
debate at Long Island's Hofstra University, where they bonded over their
love of politics.

Their wedding was attended by 700 
people at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, including political heavyweights 
Bill and Hillary Clinton, Rudy Giuliani, current Secretary of State John
Kerry and former New York Governor George Pataki, according to a New York Times wedding announcement.

The couple enjoyed the red-carpet treatment from the Chinese government, visiting Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou, and taking tours of Tienanmen 
Square and the Great Wall.

Nixon Cox's China visit came 
alongside what would have been President Nixon's 100th birthday, and he 
celebrated the milestone by retracing the steps of the former president.

His grandfather's visit to the Communist nation ended more than 25 years of separation between the feuding 
nations.

The former president later described the trip as 'the week that 
changed the world.'
