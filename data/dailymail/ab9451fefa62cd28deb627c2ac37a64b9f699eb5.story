Police in suburban Phoenix have arrested a married couple on suspicion of child abuse, accusing them of severely malnourishing two adopted daughters and forcing them to sleep in a backyard tent either nude or only in a diaper.

According to Peoria police, the 13-year-old and 11-year-old girls also were subjected to strict punishment that included hour-long running sessions and memorization of Bible verses.

Kimery Lynn Jorg, the girls' 53-year-old adoptive mother, said that the abuse was intended to 'train' the girls and teach them to be 'loving and nurturing'.

Kimery and her husband Johann Glenn Jorg, 61, appeared Thursday night before a judge who set bond at $100,000 each.

Child Protective Services visited the home May 30 and alerted  authorities after finding both girls emaciated.

Officials said the 13-year-old, who was 4 feet 11 inches, appeared to weigh only 60 pounds. Aside from being underfed, the teen had abnormal growths on her legs and blisters on her feet from excessive exercise.

She also had 'leathering' skin consistent with repeated beatings, according to a police statement filed in court. The teen was immediately hospitalized for severe malnutrition and local station KPTV reported that the girl's condition was similar to that of a 'concentration camp survivor'.

The 11-year-old girl underwent a medical exam.

Officials with Child Protective Services said an 8-year-old girl and 7-year-old girl also were removed from the home but authorities said they appeared healthy as the couple apparently favored them.

Police said all four girls lived in abusive environments before being adopted by the Jorgs.

Kimery Jorg told police she wanted to expose the two older girls to prison-like conditions for lying or stealing.

When asked by police what the girls had stolen to prompt such punishment, the parents had difficulty recalling specific items but said that on a trip to Canada, 22 items went missing in their relative's house and Kimery Jorg blamed the girls.

She also mentioned the theft of a single Mentos breath mint as another offense.

The 13- and 11-year-old were forced to use a bucket and brown bags as a toilet. They were given diapers to wear as a reward for good behavior, police said.

The 13-year-old had to sleep in a tent and had her hair shaved as discipline, police said.

The two girls were fed 'prison food' of oatmeal, prunes or grits and salsa.

Unjustifiable: Kimery Jorg said that her adopted daughters stole from her but when asked what they took, she could only recall a single Mento breathment being stolen

According to police, the couple thought their treatment was justified.

Punishments included getting swatted on the buttocks with a wooden paddle or having apple cider vinegar sprayed in their mouths, police said.

The number of times they were hit or sprayed was equivalent to their years of age.

The girls also were forced to run outside in the heat for an hour and write and recite Bible verses. The running reportedly would go longer if any mistakes were found in the verses.

The girls, who were home-schooled, also were forced to run outside in the heat for an hour and write and recite Bible verses. The running reportedly would go longer if any mistakes were found in the verses.

Neighbor Jodi Brackett said all four girls appeared fine in a Christmas card family portrait in December. But she realizes now she hardly ever saw the two older girls, while she frequently saw the two younger girls riding their bicycles.

'I kept forgetting they had two other girls,' Brackett said.

Brackett described Kimery Jorg as cordial and said the Jorgs once offered neighbors leftover food from a wedding.

'She was very nice — no red flag or anything,' Brackett said.
