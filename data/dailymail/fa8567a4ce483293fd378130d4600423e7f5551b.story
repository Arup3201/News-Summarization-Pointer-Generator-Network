Krystian Bielik is only 16 years old, but has impressed at Legia Warsaw

Arsenal are keen on Legia Warsaw teenage midfielder Krystian Bielik. 

The 16-year-old has already broken into the Polish side's first team and is earmarked for a bright future. 

He is under contract until 2017 but Legia would consider offers for the 6ft 2ins defensive midfielder.

Arsenal's Premier League rivals Everton have also watched Bielik but are focusing their attention on his older teammate midfielder Ondrej Duda.

The 20-year-old Slovakia international has been watched by Roberto Martinez's trusted chief scout Kevin Reeves and has scored five goals this season.

Arsene Wenger is no stranger to using players from his youth ranks, having named Chuba Akpom, Gedion Zelalem, Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Stefan O'Connor, Alex Iwobi and Glen Kamara on his bench for the Champions League tie against Galatasaray on Tuesday night. 

Arsenal have already qualified for the Champions League knockout stages, but the game could still prove vital as the Gunners have a chance to finish top of their group.
