For arthritis sufferers who have pain in their hands, everyday tasks such as tying shoelaces or picking up a kettle can be a struggle. But for patients whose condition cannot be eased with steroid injections, doctors are offering a radical alternative – finger or thumb-joint replacements.

Although less common than hip or knee-replacement surgery, it can bring the same benefits of pain relief and, potentially, increased mobility. ‘

The most common cause of stiffness in the hand joints is osteoarthritis and this can be very painful,’ says Mr Mike Hayton, a consultant orthopaedic hand surgeon at the Wrightington Hospital in Wigan.

Pure magic: Richard Smith was performing again three months after his thumb operation

‘In patients for whom other treatments such as steroid injections have been ineffective, surgery is a real option.’ Osteoarthritis is a condition where the cartilage – a smooth substance that coats the ends of a joint and allows sliding movements – becomes worn away so that bare bone rubs on bare bone, causing stiffness and pain. It affects about eight million Britons.

One NHS patient who has benefited from a new thumb joint is professional magician Richard Smith. Although the 58-year-old from Kirkby, Merseyside, does not have arthritis, he was left unable to move his left thumb after a DIY accident with a power drill.

‘Mr Smith’s interphalangeal joint – the one just below the nail – fused,’ explains Mr Hayton, who performed the operation.

‘The bone grew across the joint, so there was no movement. For most people that wouldn’t be a problem, but for Mr Smith, it meant that he was unable to perform his intricate tricks. To regain movement, his only option was a thumb-joint replacement.’

The procedure is the same as that for finger joints. First, the ends of two bones are removed with a small surgical saw, via a 3cm incision in the back of the thumb.

A cavity is then made inside the bone canal – the honeycomb-like inner – for the stem of the implant to sit in. This shaft is created with a reamer, a serrated metal instrument the same size as the implant stem.

A trial implant is inserted first in order to assess movement range, alignment and joint stability. Once the fit feels right, the trial implant is removed and a sterilised joint replacement is inserted instead. Mr Smith has a one-piece implant – ‘basically it’s a silicone hinge that bends when the thumb is flexed and straightens when the thumb is extended’, says Mr Hayton. ‘These implants are generally very safe.’

Two-piece components made from metal and plastic can also be used but they are technically more difficult to fit, and cannot be used where there has been a lot of damage to the joint or bones as they may dislocate.

The procedure can be done under general or local anaesthetic and takes about 20 minutes. Mr Hayton prefers to use a local anaesthetic. ‘That way I can ask the patient to move their finger or thumb and ensure there’s enough movement and stability,’ he says.

Following surgery, a patient sees a specialist hand physiotherapist to begin a rehabilitation programme, and can usually resume normal activities within six to eight weeks.

‘The operation is effective for pain relief and may improve movement, but based on patient data we don’t promise increased movement,’ says Mr Hayton.

‘Joint-replacement often preserves rather than improves motion. Relieving pain is the greatest motivation for this kind of operation as pain makes people miserable and can restrict their activities.’

Richard, who underwent his procedure in November 2011, was performing again just three months later. He can flex his thumb without pain and is delighted with the results.

‘My first thought when the joint fused was how I could do my card and coin tricks,’ he says. ‘During the operation, I felt like crying when I saw the joint moving again. Now I’m just so happy.’
