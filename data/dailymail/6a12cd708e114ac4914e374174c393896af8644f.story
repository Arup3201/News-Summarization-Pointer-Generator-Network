Premier League clubs splashed out a whopping £220,800,000 on new strikers during last summer's transfer window, with mixed results to say the least.

While some players have taken to life in England like ducks to water, finding the back of the net on a regular basis and immediately earning a place in the hearts of supporters, others haven't been quite so lucky.

But with a huge disparity between the fees shelled out on new attacking talent, which acquisitions have been the best value so far?

To decide, MailOnline Sport has done some calculations and worked out the cost of each top-flight goal scored by the forwards signed for cold, hard cash last summer.

And with those who arrived on free transfers before the window slammed shut back on September 1 exempt, Crystal Palace's Fraizer Campbell has emerged as the best buy.

The former Manchester United and Sunderland man moved to Selhurst Park from relegated Cardiff in late July for just £800,000 and has since scored three league goals.

The 27-year-old netted in wins against Everton and Leicester before scoring in the Eagles' 2-1 home defeat by Chelsea, giving him an impressive cost-per-goal of just under £267,000 - the best return in the division.

Newcastle's Ayoze Perez has been hitting the headlines in recent weeks and, after costing Alan Pardew just £1.5million from Tenerife, sits second in our countdown.

Three winning goals against Tottenham, Liverpool and West Brom mean the 21-year-old's strikes have cost £500,000 apiece so far - a figure which looks certain to reduce significantly as the season goes on.

Completing the top three is West Ham's Diafra Sakho, who has managed six goals in his eight Premier League appearances since moving to Upton Park from Metz for £3.5m.

The Senegalese forward has cost the Hammers £583,000 per goal after finding the back of the net in consecutive matches against Hull, Liverpool, Manchester United, QPR, Burnley and champions Manchester City.

Two of last summer's big-money transfers saw Alexis Sanchez and Diego Costa swap Spain for England for a combined cost of £62million.

Chilean Sanchez has hit the ground running at Arsenal after leaving Barcelona, scoring eight top-flight goals in 10 appearances to begin paying back his £30million fee.

Those strikes, the most recent of which came against Swansea last weekend, mean Sanchez has cost the Gunners £3.75m per goal, while £32m man Costa has set Chelsea back £3.2m for every strike after netting 10 goals in just nine games.

It's been a different story for Arsene Wenger's other attacking acquisition, with £16m forward Danny Welbeck having scored just twice in the Premier League.

His cost of £8m per goal is the same as Loic Remy, who remained in west London with Jose Mourinho's side after deciding to leave QPR.

Romelu Lukaku is another young striker with a hefty price-tag to contend with after leaving Chelsea to join Everton on a £28m permanent deal following a successful loan spell last term.

The 21-year-old Belgian has managed four goals under Roberto Martinez this season, making him one of the more costly summer additions at £7m a goal so far.

The former Anderlecht youngster has still fared considerably better than Brendan Rodgers' summer signings across Stanley Park though, with Rickie Lambert and Mario Balotelli yet to find the back of the net in the league.

Balotelli, a £16m buy from AC Milan, has only managed to score in the Champions League against Ludogorets and in the Capital One Cup against Swansea while £4m Lambert has struggled to make his mark since leaving Southampton.

There's better news for Saints fans, who have a new hero in £8m Italian frontman Graziano Pelle. The former Feyenoord striker has already hit six goals in his debut campaign, at a cost of £1.33m per strike.

Manager Ronald Koeman also splashed out £12m on Hull's Shane Long but the Republic of Ireland international is only just starting to find his form. His brace against Leicester last weekend means he has cost a substantial £6m a goal during his brief spell in red and white.

Manchester United opted to pursue a late loan deal for Monaco's prolific striker Radamel Falcao, eventually bringing the Colombian to Old Trafford on a temporary deal for the season.

But it's not happened for the former Atletico Madrid star in Manchester, with his £6m loan fee paying for just a single goal - the winner against Everton at Old Trafford last month.
