A baby miraculously survived after doctors were unable to find her heartbeat for 14 minutes following her birth.

When Jill Aiken went into labour after only 26 weeks of pregnancy her daughter was forced to undergo an emergency blood transfusion.

But after 35 days in hospital kept on respiratory support in neonatal intensive care, Jasmine Aiken-Burnikell, now aged eight months, is going from strength-to-strength.

Miracle baby: Jill Aiken and her eight-month-old daughter Jasmine Aiken-Burnikell, who was born 14 weeks premature. Doctors could not find the child's heartbeat for 14 minutes

Having already suffered a miscarriage two months before falling pregnant with Jasmine, Miss Aiken was terrified that she was going to lose her child after going into labour so early.

When Jasmine was born 14-weeks early following her mother's five-day labour she weighed just 2lb 2oz.

Doctors immediately took the child from her mother after the birth and frantically tried to resuscitate her at the hospital bedside as they struggled to find a heartbeat.

Miss Aiken was only able to hold her daughter for the first time four-days later.

Recalling the ordeal, Miss Aiken, from High Barnes, Sunderland, said: 'I asked a doctor if she would make it and he said he honestly didn't know whether she would.'

She added: 'She was so very fragile that she couldn't be moved for the first few days, all she could do was hold my finger.

'When she was stronger I was able to hold her once a day and those moments were so precious.'

Born on July 10 last year, doctors soon realised that Jasmine had an open duct in her heart that eventually closed without the need for surgery.

After spending the first 11 weeks of 
her life in hospital, the youngster was finally well enough to go home.

However, she remains on oxygen to help with the chronic lung disease she now suffers from after being born before her lungs could properly develop.

Miss Aiken said that her daughter's name means 'gift from God', adding: 'We really think she is'.

Now weighing 12lb 3oz, Jasmine's mother and father Simon Burnikell are determined to 
help the Sunderland Royal hospital ward that saved her life.

Miss Aiken, a support worker for the North East Autism Society, said: 'Without the neonatal unit, Jasmine would not be here.

'The work they do is amazing. If it hadn't been for the technology they use and the fabulous work of the nurses and doctors, Jasmine would not have been here had she been born 10 years ago.

Jasmine has also inspired Humbledon Methodist Church to choose the unit as its charity for the year.
