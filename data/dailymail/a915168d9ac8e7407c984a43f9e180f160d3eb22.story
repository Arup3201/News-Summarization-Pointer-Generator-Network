The bridge of a huge, new £6bn warship set sail for an extraordinary 600-mile voyage today, but something rather important was missing - the rest of the ship.

The large section of the Royal Navy’s new aircraft carrier was a strange sight to see as it left the BAE Systems’ shipyard in Portsmouth, Hampshire to join the remainder of the 65,000-tonne carrier on a dry dock in Rosyth, Fife in Scotland.

Onlookers compared the fully-painted, 680-tonne bridge of HMS Queen Elizabeth to ‘something out of Star Trek’ as it towered over surrounding boats.

HMS Queen Elizabeth is the first of two new warships ordered by the government. They are the largest ships ever built for the navy and have cost more than £6billion to build.

The first carrier is due to be launched for the first time next year and ministers hope that both vessels will be operational from 2020.

It took hundreds of BAE shipbuilders more than 16 months to build the Forward Island bridge tower at Portsmouth Naval Base.

The bridge has already been fully fitted out with windows, cutting-edge electronic controls and the seats from where commanders will plot global missions.

One of the largest cranes in Europe will eventually plant the bridge on top of Queen Elizabeth's flight deck as the UK-wide engineering project comes together.

After installing 37 miles of cables and 
3,101 pipes inside the section, shipbuilders gathered at the jetty to 
admire their handiwork today.

Send off: Today was an 'iconic milestone' in building the new flagships, project leader Paul Bowsher said

Paul Bowsher, who leads the building project for BAE Systems in Portsmouth, told his staff: ‘Today is a day of celebration - it is both an important and iconic milestone in the programme to build the nation's new flagships.

‘The delivery of the Forward Island marks a new and exciting phase in the programme when we begin to really see the immense scale of the Queen Elizabeth Class aircraft carriers as the first ship comes together at Rosyth.

‘I would like to thank all involved in the programme for your continued commitment and professionalism as we work together to deliver these magnificent ships.’
