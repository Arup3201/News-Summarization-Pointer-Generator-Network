Mike Ashley has backed Alan Pardew after clear-the-air talks with the Newcastle manager over his future.

The club’s owner has told Pardew he doesn’t want to judge his four year spell at St James’ Park in the opening four games of the season in the Barclays Premier League.

Pardew is under massive pressure from Newcastle supporters after their disappointing start to the season left them bottom of the table with just two points.

They lost 4-0 at Southampton on Saturday and Pardew knows he will walk into a hostile environment when they place Hull at St James’ Park on Saturday.

Despite the negativity at St James’ Park, Newcastle are only three points behind Manchester United in ninth place and Everton in 10th.

Ashley was at St Mary’s to watch his team surrender against Saints, but he is holding his nerve despite the demands from Newcastle fans to fire the manager.

They are bottom of the Premier League table after four games, but Pardew has no intention of walking away from the club.

On Saturday his assistant John Carver was allegedly involved in a heated exchange with Newcastle fans when they demanded Pardew’s dismissal.

A banner was unfurled with the words ‘Pardew is a muppet’ during the game and he was subjected to more unfavourable chants throughout their disappointing performance.

Although Pardew signed an eight year contract with the club in September 2012, there is a break clause in the deal if Ashley decides to sack his boss.

Ashley would have pay a fixed fee in compensation - around £5million - to sack Pardew, but he vowed to support his manager during talks over the past 48 hours.

The total bill to fire Pardew and bring in another manager, such as Steve Bruce or former Crystal Palace boss Tony Pulis, would cost around £8m.

In addition to the costs involved in sacking Pardew, the Newcastle owner would have to pay compensation to Hull if he wanted to appointed Bruce.

Although Pulis is no longer with Palace, he is still under contract with the south London club and and a compensation figure of around £3m is in existence.
