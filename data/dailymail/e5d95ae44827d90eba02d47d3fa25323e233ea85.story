The teacher who leaked information about Frances Abbott receiving a $60,000 scholarship to a Sydney design school has spoken out for the first time, saying he does not believe the Prime Minister's daughter deserved the money.

Melletios Kyriakidis was revealed as the employee who exchanged emails with a librarian who has been charged with hacking computer files at Sydney's Whitehouse Institute of Design on May 20.

He was investigated for breaching student privacy but in June he resigned before the review was completed.

In May, it was revealed Frances Abbott had received a $60,000 scholarship to attend Whitehouse Institute of Design

Mr Kyriakidis, who taught Ms Abbott for three years, has lodged a complaint with the Fair Work Commission, claiming he was constructively dismissed and that he was treated differently because of his political views, according to Australian Financial Review.

The design academic told AFR he did not access any records illegally, but did contact journalists and politicians on May 14 while he was still working at the institute asking them to look into why Ms Abbott did not have to pay any tuition fees.

Mr Kyriakidis also added that even though he thought Ms Abbott was a 'lovely person', he said there were 'a lot more people' who deserved the scholarship over her.

Melletios Kyriakidis was the former employee who leaked information to the media about the controversy

'Even from her class I could name 10 people more deserving either for merit or financial need or both,' he told AFR.

Last week, Whitehouse Institute of Design's chief executive officer Ian Tudor confirmed to the Daily Mail Australia that an 'adverse action case' by a former employee was to be heard by the workplace relations tribunal.

Mr Tudor told the Daily Mail Australia the institute was 'confident that the adverse action case is without merit and has no prospect of success'.

'The former employeeÂ  (Kyriakidis) concerned was subject to an internal disciplinary review and resigned before that review was complete,' he said in a statement.

'Given that the matter is currently before the Fair Work Commission, we will be making no further comment.'

Mr Kyriakidis said he did not think Ms Abbott (pictured far right with her family and Prince Harry) deserved the scholarship

Daily Mail Australia contacted Mr Kyriakidis but he said as the matter was before the tribunal he was unable to comment. His representative is yet to respond to questions.

Mr Kyriakidis is being represented by the same firm who handled James Ashby's sexual harrassment case against former speaker Peter Slipper, Harmers Workplace Lawyers.

Mr Abbott has also been added as a respondent on Mr Kyriakidis' legal claim against Whitehouse Institute of Design.

When it was revealed in May Ms Abbott had received the scholarship, it caused widespread student protests because Mr Abbott failed to declare the scholarship on his pecuniary interest register, including gifts awarded to their children.

The tribunal will hear Mr Kyriakidis's case on Tuesday in Sydney.
