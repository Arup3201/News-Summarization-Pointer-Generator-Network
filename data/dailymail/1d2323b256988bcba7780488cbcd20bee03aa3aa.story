He was the debonair black-clad hero who risked life and limb to deliver chocolates to his beloved – and all because the lady loved Milk Tray.

But it seems both ladies and their would-be paramours are more likely to turn up their noses at a box of the iconic Cadbury chocolates these days amid complaints about quality and flavour.

Websites and social networking forums have been inundated with concerns about the poor taste of the chocolates and claims that old favourites have been reformulated or dropped completely.

Wrong selection: The new Milk Tray box has left many customers angry by the poor choice of chocolates. The orange crescent and hazelnut whirl, both circled, are at the centre of the storm

The complaints have surfaced two years after the controversial  £11 billion takeover of Cadbury by American food giant Kraft Foods.

There is particular outrage about the orange truffle, a replacement for the traditional orange cream.

Consumers say that the modern crescent-shaped version is a poor imitation of its rich, creamy pre-decessor with only a hint of orange flavour.

The hazelnut whirl has also been the subject of vigorous debate, with many claiming it has been reformulated and its distinctive hard-edged grooves replaced with softer whirls.

Meanwhile, eagle-eyed shoppers have also noticed the absence of coffee creams and mocha-flavoured chocolates, and bemoaned the loss of the paper menu from boxes, once delivered by action man Gary Myers in the iconic Seventies TV adverts.

Instead, they point out that there are now four different caramel  chocolates and three separate hazel-nut sweets in a standard 7.05oz (200g) box.

On social networking site Twitter, Zara Horner wrote on April 9:  ‘Cadbury milk tray chocolates are vile! #disappointed.’

Two
days later, fellow user Graham Fielding added: ‘Milk Tray is so cheap 
these days. It doesn’t seem the luxury product it was in my youth.’

On
a specialist food review website on April 8, an anonymous man 
described how he was given a box of Milk Tray as an Easter gift from his
wife.

‘I was really looking forward to the lovely creamy taste of the chocolate and the creamy flavours of the various creme centres,’ he began.

Then he fumed: ‘WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! They were absolute rubbish. The chocolate was not at all smooth and left a nasty aftertaste in the mouth.

The old creme fillings have either been completely eliminated, as with the orange flavour, or have been completely changed in taste. The coffee-flavoured chocs have disappeared completely.

‘I shall not be buying ANY more of these chocolates ever again.’Another
contributor commented: ‘Rubbish! They certainly weren’t like the Milk 
Tray that I remember [delicious and full of flavour]. They all tasted 
more or less the same, very artificial and certainly not a lot of 
variety.

‘The box looks impressive but the contents leave a lot to be desired and I certainly won’t be buying them again!’

Another, who signed herself meledna, remarked on April 16 last year: ‘I can describe them in two words. BORING. BLAND.’

There are also accusations on the websites that Kraft is responsible for the changes.

But Kraft insists that any changes to ingredients and production methods predate the takeover, and go back to 2007.

At the time of Kraft’s hostile bid for Cadbury, there was a public outcry and more than 20,000 Mail on Sunday readers backed this newspaper’s campaign to ‘Keep Cadbury British’.

There were concerns that the quality of the chocolate would suffer if operations were taken over by the US company.

Many worried about the loss of another historic British brand and the potential loss of jobs in the UK prompted by the takeover.

When Chicago-based Kraft succeeded in its takeover early in 2010, it was criticised by MPs for reneging on a promise to keep open a factory near Bristol.

The move resulted in the loss of hundreds of jobs as production moved to Poland. Kraft boss Irene Rosenfeld, dubbed the ‘Queen Of Cheese’ because of the firm’s other famous product, refused to fly to Britain to answer questions over the U-turn.

Kraft has also been allowed to keep the Royal Warrant on Milk Tray boxes, an award first given to Cadbury by Queen Victoria in 1854.

The decision follows detailed consideration by the Royal Warrant Holders Association.

Secretary Richard Peck explained: ‘A Royal Warrant is granted to a company, and it may well be that company manufactures the product abroad – but that’s the way the market works these days.

‘In the case of Cadbury, when it was acquired by Kraft it was looked at very carefully and the situation was considered and accepted.’Kraft last night defended Milk Tray, which enjoys sales worth  £20 million in the UK every year.

Tony Bilsborough, head of external communications at Kraft UK, said: ‘We have not seen any increase in complaints about Milk Tray.

‘We conduct extensive scientific consumer research and are constantly checking on people’s likes, dislikes and hates.’ Mr Bilsborough added:

‘Orange and strawberry chocolates have changed because in 2007 we moved away from artificial colourings and we no longer use them in our products.

‘Orange oil is now used to flavour the orange chocolate and straw- berries for the strawberry one.’

He also conceded that the hazelnut whirl had changed ‘because of different machinery in the Polish factory’.

He added that ‘consumers have told us they don’t like hard edges on chocolates, so there are smoother curves on the hazelnut’.

Kraft said the paper menu had been discontinued as part of their commitment to reduce unnecessary packaging.

Verdict by Tom Parker Bowles

Just what have they gone and done? To Milk Tray, I mean, the box of chocolates so damned sophisticated they were delivered by a superspy clad in a superfine cashmere polo neck.

He skied down vertical slopes, powered speedboats over Mafia baddies and waterfalls, hung from creaking cable cars, dived from cliffs, dodged sharks and all because … the lady loved Milk Tray.

OK, despite the sub Lazenby-as-Bond adverts, these were resolutely democratic chocolates.

Choc choice: Tom is switching to rival Nestle's Quality Street from now instead of classic Milk Tray

Modest too, not the sort to boast about high cocoa content, or Fairtrade beans. And all the better for it – far preferable to those snooty Lindts and upwardly-mobile Milkas. I bow to no one in my love for Dairy Milk.

And the joy of Milk Tray used to be lashings of the stuff, draped across over-sweet, garish pink strawberry centres and lurid orange creams. You weren’t looking for natural essences and hand-crafted pieces, but rather solid, reliable chocolate.

Now, though, in their new-look box, every single piece seems to taste the same. Dull, turgid and slightly greasy.

The ‘hazelnut heaven’ sees a pretty paltry nut buried in a waxy, dog-choc-like mound of chocolate mud.

‘Orange truffle’ is a sorry excuse, with only the very faintest whisper of citrus. I’m not sure what the ‘nut secret’ is hiding, but one nibble is more than enough.

‘Honey love’ might be a half-decent name for a Bond girl. In a chocolate, though, it’s debased, like chewing on beeswax lip balm.

In fact, the only two that come close to the old-fashioned favourites are the ‘eastern delight’ (the chocolate formerly known as Turkish Delight.) And an OK-ish ‘caramel charm’.

Even these two rays of relative light can’t escape the curse of that cheap, nasty chocolate covering.

The sad truth is that these taste more like American chocolate than British. And as anyone who has ever suffered the rank indignities of Hershey’s and its ilk know only too well, this is very bad news indeed.

Cadbury say the chocolates are ‘made in the EU Under Licence’. It seems the process has long departed this sceptred isle. The only really good news is that the cursed coffee one has been given the boot. But too little, too late.

Farewell Milk Tray. From now on, it’s Quality Street all the way.
