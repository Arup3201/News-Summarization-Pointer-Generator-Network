The number of students ditching the UK for a round-the-world gap year trip has increased by 25 per cent compared to last year.

As thousands of UK teenagers gear up for A-level results day next week, figures reveal a jump in applications for working holiday visas for Australia and New Zealand.

A student travel expert has said the rise in people choosing a gap year adventure is due to the jobs market in the UK being ‘still very tough’.

Popular: Australia remains one of the top gap year destinations, with New Zealand, America, Thailand and Peru

The figures were provided by STA Travel, which revealed those leaving school this 
year are booking more off-the-beaten track adventures.

The
youth travel company also revealed Iceland is its fastest-growing destination, with 
students stopping off their on their way to or from the US.

Glen
 Mintrim, managing director of student and youth travel company STA 
Travel, said: 'The job market is still very tough for young people in 
the UK.

'More and more are 
taking the opportunity to head off on a gap year trip to broaden their 
work and life experience, and bolster their CV with overseas work 
experience.

'For example, 
we’ve seen a 10 per cent increase in sales of Working Holiday Visas for 
Australia compared to last summer, and 16 per cent for New Zealand.'

Breaking away from the norm: Lesser travelled destinations, such as Iceland, are on the up

The great escape: More young travellers are heading to Borneo, the Philippines and Bali

The
 most popular gap year destinations are Australia, New Zealand, the USA,
 Thailand and Peru, but youngsters are becoming keen to break away from 
more keen to break away from traditional backpacking routes.

Mintrim
 said: 'Iceland is our fastest growing destination as people are 
stopping off there on their way to or way back from New York or the east
 coast of the USA.’

Bali, Manila and Borneo are also growing in popularity, with a 75 per cent year-on-year rise in bookings.

Mintrim
 said this was because the off-the-beaten-track destinations have ‘extra
 social media talkability’ – so students can post about their trip while
 away.

South Africa is also
 in the spotlight, with Cape Town and Windhoek seeing numbers up by 35 
per cent and 38 per cent respectively.

Mintrim added: 'Gap years have never been so meticulously planned.

'Our
 customers know that to get the most out of their trip they must factor 
in different elements in advance, such as Working Holiday Visas, 
volunteering projects, adventure activities eg trekking or scuba 
courses, or pre-booking must-see cultural sites such as Angkor Wat or 
the Taj Mahal.'
