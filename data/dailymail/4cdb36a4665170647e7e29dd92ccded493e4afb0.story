If you thought your father was embarrassing, get ready to see 'dad dancing' taken to a whole new level.

The video appears to show The Christmas Jumpers on the dancefloor at a school talent show. All decked out in fetching festive jumpers, the middle-aged dance crew confidently take their positions on stage for what we can only assume will be an embarrassing performance.

But when the dubstep remix of The Nutcracker's classic Dance Of the Sugar Plum Fairy kicks in, it's clear that these fathers know how to move.

The Christmas Jumpers, a professional dance crew, perform some impressive moves to the remix of The Nutcracker's Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy in the clever viral video released by Sainsbury's

The unexpected performance shows some moves that even Britain's Got Talent's dance group Diversity would be proud of

Launching into an expertly choreographed routine that even Britain's Got Talent's dance group Diversity would be proud of, the dancers bust out some high energy, break dance moves to the crowd's delight.

The stunt is a clever viral video for Sainsbury's who revealed the group are actually professional dancers wearing jumpers from the supermarket's Tu range.

The lighthearted and funny video is in sharp contrast to Sainsbury's controversial Christmas television advert which first aired last month.

The advert, which features soldiers in the trenches during World War I over Christmas, had split public opinion with some saying calling it a moving tribute 100th anniversary of WWI, while others had criticsed it as a cynical way for a big business to advertise itself.
