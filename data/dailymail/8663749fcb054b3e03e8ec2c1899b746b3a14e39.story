Trial: Former BBC star Stuart Hall, 84, of Wilmslow, Cheshire, today admitted one charge of indecently assaulting a girl under 16

Veteran broadcaster Stuart Hall has pleaded guilty to one charge of indecent assault on a girl under 16 ahead of his trial for a string of sex assaults.

The 84-year-old stood in the dock at Preston Crown Court and replied 'Guilty' when asked how he pleaded to the offence, which took place between 26 January 1978 and 1 January 1979

He will now go on trial later today accused of raping and indecently assaulting two young girls.

Hall, of Wilmslow, Cheshire, is charged with seven counts of rape against one complainant between 1976 and 1978 in Manchester. Five of the rapes are said to have taken place when she was aged under 16.

He is also accused of two counts of indecent assault against the woman within the same period, plus eight counts of rape and three indecent assaults against a second alleged victim between 1976 and 1981, at various locations in Greater Manchester and Cheshire.

One of those alleged rapes is said to have taken place when the complainant was aged under 13.

The charge he admitted today was a new indictment, Count 21, which the judge allowed the prosecutor to add to the charge sheet this morning.

Led into the dock in front of a packed press bench, Hall was asked by the clerk of the court to identify himself as James Stuart Hall and he replied: 'Yes, I am.'

The former It's A Knockout presenter has pleaded not guilty to all 20 allegations he will be tried for this week.

He has been a familiar face and voice in British broadcasting for half a century, and his eccentric and erudite football match summaries made him a cult figure on BBC Radio 5 Live.

The trial at Preston Crown Court, which starts today, is estimated to last seven days.
