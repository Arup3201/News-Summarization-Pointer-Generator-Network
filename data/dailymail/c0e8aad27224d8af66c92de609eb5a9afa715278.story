It could take up to five years to solve the problems in the NHS which have caused a crisis in accident and emergency departments across the country, a senior health official warned.

Professor Keith Willett, who led a review of England's casualty units, insisted there was no 'quick fix' to the chaos in many hospitals, which has seen the numbers visiting A&E surge by 400,000 since April as a result of the NHS 111 helpline.

More doctors and nurses need to be recruited and the funding system changed to reduce waiting times and prevent bed blocking by elderly patients waiting for social care.

Professor Keith Willett insisted there was 'quick fix' to the chaos in many hospitals, which has seen the numbers visiting A&E surge by 400,000 since April.

Their comments came after figures showed that the numbers of patients being seen within the four-hour target period dropped to 86.7 per cent in the week ending January 4.

The soaring number of visits has been blamed on an ageing population and patients flocking to hospitals to have minor ailments treated.

The government has come under increasing pressure over the winter crisis in the NHS, with Labour vowing to make the health service a central plank of its election campaign.

Professor Willett warned that the problems could not be solved in just a few months. Giving evidence to the health select committee, he said the entire health system needed to be overhauled to ensure changes in one area do not impact other parts of the NHS.

'We have had numerous examples over numerous years of doing one really good initiative in one part of the pathway and it doesn't have the effect we expect because the rest of the pathway is sufficiently busy to negate the advantages of that.'

He said his emergency care review had found there was a need for a 'transformation of the whole system'.

There had to be a 'particular focus' on out-of-hospital care to 'both reduce demand and alleviate the issues of congestion within the hospital'.

But he warned: 'It is not going to be a quick fix. We have said it is going to be three to five years to get all of these things in place.'

He said staffing issues had to be addressed as well as changing the way people are treated to stop beds being taken by people unable to leave hospital while waiting for social care.

Ambulance trusts have been accused of reclassifying call-outs to free them from response time targets

Professor Willett said: 'We have heard about recruitment issues in general practice, in acute medicine, in emergency medicine, in paramedics.

'Those things are not addressed over a few months. We also know that the curriculum has got to change. We know that we have got to have better connectivity around information and we have better working relationships.

'And we have to change the payments system that is not all going to happen inside one year.'

NHS England medical director Sir Bruce Keogh said it would 'foolish' to claim there would be no repeat next winter of the problems which have seen hospitals fail to meet their target of seeing 95% of A&E admissions within four hours.

'In answer to the question 'Can we tell you that next winter that we will be okay?' I think it would be very foolish to sit here and say this because it is part of a three to five year programme,' he said.

Dr Clifford Mann, the president of the College of Emergency Medicine, told MPs that since April there had been more than 14 million visits to A&E, a rise of 446,049 on last year. 

He said NHS 111 was to blame for the bulk of the increase. 'Of the 450,000 extra attendances in the system in the last year, 220,000 were advised by NHS 111 to come to the emergency department and another 220,000 had an ambulance despatched to them by NHS 111.

'If you put those figures together you have more than 95 per cent of the rise in type 1 [major A&E unit] attendances. I don't think we should blame people for attending the emergency department when we've told them to go there. It's absurd.' 

Dr Clifford Mann, the president of the College of Emergency Medicine, told MPs that since April there had been more than 14 million visits to A&E, a rise of 446,049 on last year

'That's certainly true, but the other way of describing it is to say that's equivalent to eight or nine extra emergency departments and of course we haven't built or staffed eight or nine extra emergency departments in the last 12 months.'

A surge in demand for emergency care is also hitting ambulance services hard. Paramedics say they are so overstretched they often rely on firemen and police officers to take patients to hospital. 

NHS figures last week showed that eight out of ten ambulance trusts in England miss the target for responding to life-threatening calls. 

Ambulance chiefs were accused last night of risking patients' lives to meet response time targets.

One trust may have hastened the deaths of dozens of desperately ill people by downgrading emergency call-outs to non-urgent. 

This freed them from hitting a response time target of eight minutes.

East of England Ambulance Service admits that 8,324 patients had their cases reclassified in this way in a two-month period last year.

At least 57 were not taken to hospital and died. Some of those downgraded had a terminal illness or a 'do not resuscitate' order.

It emerged last night that another major ambulance trust – Yorkshire – is also suspected of recategorising thousands of urgent cases.

Managers made the calls 'non-urgent' when they realised ambulances were not going to reach patients inside the eight-minute window.

Denise Burke, of the Norfolk-based campaign group Action on Ambulances, said: 'They are playing Russian roulette with patients' lives.

'What is most shocking with East Anglia is the way patients who were near the end of life were treated. They were deciding on patients' quality of life and whether they died then or in dignity a few months later.

'Any of those families will be questioning whether their loved ones' lives could have been extended by a few months.'
