The Prime Minister faced fresh embarrassment last night after it was revealed that his new party treasurer funded his son’s membership of the notorious Bullingdon Club, which Mr Cameron belonged to when he was a student at Oxford.

Michael Farmer – a City financier who has donated more than £2.6million to the Tories – helped son George meet the high cost of joining the invitation-only, 200-year-old male dining club, whose members are renowned for their excessive privilege and wild antics.

During George Farmer’s time in the Bullingdon Club, its members were accused of going on the rampage at a smart hotel.

Mr Farmer also bailed out Oxford’s Conservative Association when a racism row led to it being kicked out of the university. His son was a senior official at the time.

There is no suggestion George Farmer, now a 22-year-old investment banker with Jefferies & Co, was involved in the hotel incident or the race row.

The disclosures come as Mr Cameron faces increasing criticism that he leads a ‘Government of chums’ out of touch with the struggles of ordinary families.  

Mr Farmer became Mr Cameron’s co-treasurer just two weeks ago, after fellow tycoon Peter Cruddas was forced to resign over the so-called ‘donorgate’ scandal. Mr Cruddas was secretly recorded offering access to No10 dinners with the Prime Minister in return for a £250,000 donation to Conservative coffers.

Mr Cameron had hoped the swift appointment of Mr Farmer would put an end to the controversy.

Instead, it has merely provided more ammunition for those who claim his inner circle is drawn from a rich and privileged elite.

The
 Bullingdon uniform alone costs more than £3,500 and club dinners cost 
hundreds of pounds, effectively restricting membership to the wealthiest
 students at Oxford University.

Since becoming Tory leader, Mr Cameron has tried hard to shrug off his Bullingdon Club past.

However,  as a new Mail on Sunday poll shows today, far right, he has failed to do so.

Shown two photographs, one of Mr Cameron in his Bullingdon sky-blue bow tie and tails, and a recent one of Mr Cameron as he would prefer to be seen, dressed in jeans drinking a pint of beer in a pub, most people chose the former as the ‘real Cameron’.

Mr Farmer, dubbed ‘Mr Copper’ after 
making £100 million from metals trading, was appointed just three months
 after enjoying a ‘kitchen supper’ with the Prime Minister at Downing 
Street.

Mr Farmer’s 
son George became active in Oxford’s political scene shortly after going
 up to St Peter’s College to read theology in 2008.

George,
 who attended the elite fee-paying St Paul’s School for Boys in London –
 Chancellor George Osborne’s old school – was social secretary of the 
Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA) in his first year.

In
 the summer of 2009, the association was embroiled in a bitter public 
scandal after candidates for election to its governing committee were 
asked at a ‘hustings’ to tell the most racist joke they knew and name 
their ‘least favourite minority’.

In
 response, one of the candidates told a joke about a black person 
hanging in a tree. Another said: ‘What do you say when you see a 
television moving around in the dark? Put it down you ****** or I’ll 
shoot you.’

The incident led to the association being banned from using the university’s name for a year. George, who was not present at the hustings when the comments were made, won election as treasurer, taking up his post at the start of the association’s year in the wilderness in October 2009.

The scandal had left the group struggling to raise funds, so George turned to his father.

Minutes from an association meeting, held that October, quote George as saying that he had ‘talked to an anonymous Tory Party donor who will .  .  . be sending us money’.

According to one student present at the meeting, it was made clear that the donor in question was Michael Farmer.

The student told The Mail on Sunday: ‘The rules say a treasurer needs to hand over £200 as a condition of taking his post. A few weeks later, George handed over a cheque which was at least ten times that amount.

‘It was made clear where the money had came from. We managed to survive on that for the rest of the year. We all said, “thank God for George’s father.” ’

The racism row was not the only scandal to blight the association during George’s tenure.

Christ Church College, Oxford: In February, an investigation by Oxford's academics ended in the club once again being stripped of university status - it is expected to reapply for admission to the university later this year

As social secretary, George had earlier helped to organise a black tie dinner at the Cavalry & Guards club in Pall Mall in June 2009, attended by former Defence Secretary Dr Liam Fox.   

But the gentleman’s club was furious that a £1,200 debt from the night remained unsettled for more than two and a half years, finally being paid only earlier this year.

It was George’s job to collect cheques for the event.

In February, an investigation by Oxford’s academics concluded that the ‘financial and administrative officers of the association did not reach the standards required of a recognised student club’ and the association was once again stripped of university status. It is expected to reapply for admission to the university later this year.  

A third row broke out in June 2010, when a female student was heckled during a debate held by the association.

Isabella Burton was told to ‘shush’ because ‘you’re a woman’ by a member of the audience, who then started chanting ‘kitchen, kitchen, kitchen, get back to the kitchen’ and ‘go back to washing the dishes’.

George became an active member of the Bullingdon Club, which numbers Mr Cameron, Mr Osborne and London Mayor Boris Johnson as former members, late in his university career, rising to become president during his final term.

The Bullingdon has been banned from meeting within 15 miles of Oxford since a notorious dinner in 1927 during which members smashed every window in a college quad.   

The club maintained its controversial reputation in June 2010, at the end of George’s second year at Oxford, when police were called to the Hartwell House hotel near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, following reports that club members had broken glasses and pulled pipes out of a bathroom.

They also investigated claims of criminal damage to a sports car.        

The event had been booked under a false name – a club tradition – because hotels and restaurants tend to be wary about its riotous reputation.

OUCA, which boasts two prime ministers, 13 cabinet ministers and three leaders of the Conservative Party among its alumni, has been a nursery for future Tory stars since it was founded in 1924. Its patron is Baroness Thatcher, a former president, and the honorary president is Foreign Secretary William Hague.

Michael Farmer, a devout Christian, who is married with two other children, built his fortune through RK Capital Management, a hedge fund.

In November, he and his wife, Jenny, had dinner with Mr Cameron in the Downing Street flat which No 10 described as ‘a social dinner for strong and long-term supporters of the party, with whom the PM has a strong relationship’.

He took over as the Tories’ co-treasurer last month.

Last night, George Farmer said: ‘My expenditure at Oxford was funded at my discretion, using my allowance and money.’

He did not deny being present at the Hartwell House dinner but stressed he was ‘not involved in any incident’.

He added: ‘I was not present at the hustings when racist jokes were made. I was not present at the event in June 2010 where sexist jokes were made. The Cavalry & Guards dinner bill had nothing to do with me due to the fact that I had no access to the accounts and I was not told that the bill had not been paid until November last year, which is when the issue arose.

‘My decision to not run for presidency of OUCA was affected by the repeated incidents of misconduct by the members which I  considered to shed a bad light on an institution that was affiliated with the national party.

‘I absolutely objected to the racist remarks made at the hustings when I became aware of what had been said. Hence my full support for the expulsion of the society members who made the remarks’.

A Conservative spokesman declined to comment, but a party source said: ‘George Farmer has clearly behaved entirely appropriately at all times.’
