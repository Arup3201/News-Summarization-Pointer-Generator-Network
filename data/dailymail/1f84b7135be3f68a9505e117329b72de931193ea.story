Ministers were facing fresh accusations of electioneering on the taxpayer last night after flocking to marginal seats across the country to announce £1billion in new spending.

Some 21 ministers, including half the Cabinet, made official visits to towns and cities across England to announce details of the Government’s ‘Growth Deals’.

Between them, they visited 19 seats that are either marginal constituencies or neighbouring marginals.

Grand plans: More than 20 ministers were in or near key seats yesterday, including David Cameron (above)

David Cameron visited two key marginal seats in Devon and Cornwall, announcing £5.9 million for a new road junction in Camborne and Redruth, where Tory MP George Eustice is defending a majority of just 66.

Nick Clegg announced £4 million to expand a ‘business incubation facility’ in Bristol, where Liberal Democrat MP Stephen Williams is defending a marginal seat.

And Tory Chief Whip Michael Gove visited Thurrock, in Essex, where Jackie Doyle-Price is fending off challenges from both Labour and Ukip.

The visits and announcements will fuel growing concerns that ministers are effectively using public funds to bolster their election campaigns.

Because the trips are ‘official’ visits, the bill is met by the taxpayer.

The high proportion of marginal seats gaining rewards is also likely to raise eyebrows.

The Cabinet Office last night denied there was any breach of rules that forbid ministers from electioneering on the taxpayer.

A spokesman said: ‘These visits are not at all about campaigning.

'They’re about going and meeting Local Enterprise Partnerships on the day they’ve agreed a billion pounds of deals with the Government.’

But Shadow Cabinet Office minister Jonathan Ashworth said: ‘Ministers need to come clean and justify this expenditure.

'They must prove this is in the public interest, not just their own electoral interest.’

The SNP last night accused the Lib Dems of a ‘desperate ploy to try and reverse their collapse in support’ following the announcement of a £300 million deal for Inverness, including £2 million to promote tourism linked to the Loch Ness Monster.

Lib Dem leader tries to claim credit for recovery 

Mr Clegg yesterday sought to claim credit for the economic recovery and urged voters to keep the Lib Dems in power as two expert forecasts suggested Britain was heading for an election stalemate.

Bidding to be part of a second coalition with either the Conservatives or Labour, Mr Clegg said that without the Lib Dems, Britain would have been plunged into a debt crisis equivalent to that in Greece. ‘Economic recovery would not have happened without us stepping up to the plate and creating this stable government,’ he said.

Mr Clegg’s pitch to remain in office came as academics at Election Forecast UK predicted a dead-heat between the two main parties, with only a three-way coalition able to command a Commons majority.

The company forecast 283 seats for the Conservatives, 283 for Labour, 33 for the Scottish Nationalists, 27 for the Lib Dems, eight for the DUP and three for Ukip.

A separate forecast, published in the Guardian, also suggested Labour and the Conservatives are on course to win the same number of seats – 273 each.
