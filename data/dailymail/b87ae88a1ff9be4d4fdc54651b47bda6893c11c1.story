British families are still poorer than they were six years ago - and the economy is not growing as fast as first thought, official figures revealed this morning.

The Office for National Statistics this morning revised down its economic growth estimates for five of the last six quarters. It means the economy is just 2.6 per cent bigger than at the same time last year, down from a previous estimate of 3 per cent.

But the ONS said despite the economic growth people are still poorer than they were at the time of the economic crash.

People's disposable income has remained 'flat' since 2012 'and remains 5.6 per cent below pre-economic downturn levels', the ONS said

People's disposable income has remained 'flat' since 2012 'and remains 5.6 per cent below pre-economic downturn levels', the ONS said.

It also revealed that GDP per head – measuring the nation's wealth divided by the number of people in the country – was 1.8 per cent below 2008.

Shabana Mahmood, Labour's Shadow Treasury Minister, said the new figures were 'concerning'.

She said: 'Growth has been revised down for five of the last six quarters, exports continue to disappoint and business investment fell in the last quarter.

'The Chancellor has totally failed to rebalance the economy as he promised. And working people are still not feeling the recovery with wages sluggish and average earnings in real terms down £1600 a year since 2010.'

She added: 'Labour's economic plan will ensure we earn our way to rising living standards for all, not just a few. Alongside sensible spending cuts and ensuring those with the broadest shoulders make a greater contribution, that's the way to get the deficit down in a tough but balanced way.'

The Office for National Statistics said the economy grew 0.6 per cent in the first three months of the year - and for the second quarter it was 0.8 per cent, down from 0.9 per cent.

Third-quarter growth was unchanged at 0.7% though it saw the best growth in household spending for four years.

But business investment narrowed at its sharpest rate in five years.

The changes mean the recovery is not as far advanced as previously thought. The latest figures took into account new information covering trade data, government spending and other parts of the economy.

The recovery is not as far advanced as previously thought, with the economy now 2.9 per cent bigger than it was before the recession, rather than 3.4 per cent

The latest figures, while disappointing, show that Britain is outperforming the rest of Europe - but still lagging behind the US

Household spending in the third quarter grew by 0.9 per cent, its strongest rate since the second quarter of 2010.

But business investment fell by 1.4 per cent, revised down from a previous estimate that it shrunk by 0.7 per cent.

The new figure was the worst performance since the second quarter of 2009.

Meanwhile, the UK current account deficit widened to £27 billion in the third quarter, equal to a record 6 per cent of GDP.
