Game of Thrones gave us a shock earlier this month during a harrowing event, dubbed the Purple Wedding.

During the scene, a major character was killed by drinking from a poisoned chalice.

As the trial for the suspected killer begins, the American Chemical Society has created a video explaining the science behind the poisoning and what plant may have been used in the plot.

A chemical expert from Nebraska has created a video explaining the science behind the poisoning. By looking at the symptoms and cause of death, Dr Raychelle Burks selects three possible naturally-occurring suspects - Deadly Night Shade, Poison Hemlock and the Strychnine Tree, pictured

The poison was said to have come from a plant, which Dr Raychelle Burks narrows down to three dangerous plants, namely Deadly Night Shade, Poison Hemlock and Styrchnine Tree.

All three plants produce alkaloids, which have at least one, potentially fatal, nitrogen atom in the heterocyclic ring. 

Dangerous alkaloids include atropine, coniine and strychnine. 

In the show, The Strangler poison caused the muscles in the victim’s
 neck to clench together restricting the flow of air to the body. 

Deadly Night Shade, also known as Atropa Belladona, and Hemlock affect muscles, however they cause these muscles to relax, not tighten.

Strychnine, on the other hand, not only causes the muscles to convulse, these symptoms start in the face and neck - which fits with the show.

During the episode, much-hated King Joffrey dies during his wedding to Margaery Tyrell after drinking wine from the poisoned cup.

The poison is dubbed The Strangler because it causes Joffrey to choke and grab at his throat.

Chemist Dr Raychelle Burks from Doane College in Nebraska has investigated what this poison could have been and why it caused the physical reactions in the TV show.

She narrows it down to three potentially poisonous plants - namely Deadly Night Shade, Poison Hemlock and Styrchnine Tree.

‘All three of these plants share something in common,’ Dr Burks explained. ‘They all make alkaloids.’

In general terms, alkaloids are naturally-occurring compounds that have at least one nitrogen atom in the heterocyclic ring.

Dangerous alkaloids include atropine, coniine and strychnine.

In the TV show, and George R.R Martin’s books, The Strangler poison causes the muscles in the victim’s neck to clench together restricting the flow of air to the body.

According to Dr Burks, this means the poison can’t be the first two suspects - Deadly Night Shade, also known as Atropa Belladona, and Hemlock - because although they affect the muscles, they cause these muscles to relax, not tighten.

This leaves strychnine. ‘Around 10 to 20 minutes after you inject a lethal dose of strychnine, your going to start feeling your muscles convulse, in the face and neck first,’ Dr Burks said.

‘This kind of fits in with how [Game of Thrones author] Martin describes The Strangler.’

According to Dr Burks, the poison couldn't be the first two suspects - Deadly Night Shade, also known as Atropa Belladona, and Hemlock - because although they affect muscles, they cause these muscles to relax, not tighten. This leaves strychnine which causes muscles to convulse in the face and neck

In the books, The Strangler is made using the leaves of a plant ‘from the sea of Jade half the world away’ and is extracted with a ‘wash of lime and sugar.’

It’s true styrchnine can be found in the leaves of a plant, but it can’t be extracted using limes.

However, alkaloids can be extracted using a process involving calcium oxide, which is a limestone product.

Dr Burks continued that sugar may have been used to disguise the bitter taste of the strychnine plant and concluded is likely the evil fictional king was murdered by this chemical.

‘Sometimes science gets a bad rap. People think it's dry or super serious,' Burks said. ‘Pop culture is really a good medium to talk about science in a way that anyone and everyone can participate.’
