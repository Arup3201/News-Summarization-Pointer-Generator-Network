Although they fell at the final hurdle, crowds were still enthusiastic as they made their best run in the tournament since 1990

The loss - which came after a goal from 
Germany's Mario Gotze in the 113th minute - ended what was Argentina's 
best World Cup run for 24 years.

But after the game, fans wearing the Argentina strip turned on each other in scenes of violence.

 police - several of whom were injured in the clashes - were also forced
 to use tear gas and let off water cannons after rocks were thrown and 
shop fronts were vandalised by a group of young men.

There were also scenes of discontent between fans outside the Maracana Stadium in the city's capital, which were captured on film.

Before the game, there had already been several protests outside the stadium by Brazilians, due to their 'anti-corruption' campaign against FIFA.

Many thought the hosts' fans and Argentines would be fighting each other considering the hostile rivalry between the two. But most of the drama appeared to be between Argentines.
