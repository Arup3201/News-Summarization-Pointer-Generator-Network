A Philadelphia police officer fatally shot while trying to stop a video game store robbery was remembered as a 'hero' at a somber funeral on Saturday.

Services for Officer Robert Wilson III began at 10 am on Saturday at the University of Pennsylvania.

The solemn ceremony honored 30-year-old Wilson, who was killed in a gunfight March 5 at a GameStop store in north Philadelphia. 

He had stopped for a security check and to buy a game for his son Quahmier when two men with semi-automatic weapons stormed in to rob the shop.

Wilson's funeral procession marched through Philadelphia during a rainstorm. He will be buried after a funeral at the University of Pennsylvania where he was remembered as a fun-loving family man

Police say the father of two was getting the game to reward his son for good grades and for his 10th birthday, which was Monday. His second son Robert Wilson IV is one year old.

Wilson did not take cover behind the counter inside the store so as to not draw fire towards employees and customers while he exchanged shots with the would-be robbers.

More than 50 shots were fired during the incident. 

The slain officer was hit multiple times but 'fought til the very end,' Philadelphia Police Department's Captain James Clark said 

Two brothers, Ramone Williams, 26, and Carlton Hipps, 29, have been arrested and charged with murder in Wilson's death.

Hipps served five years in prison for armed robbery of a liquor store and Williams has a record for assault, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.

Wilson's partner Damien Stevenson shot Hipps in the leg as he left the store.

City council on Thursday held a moment of silence in honor of Wilson, who came from a family of police officers and had been on the force for eight years.

Beyond his heroics, friends and family remembered the man they knew as 'Robbie' as a vivacious hard-worker.

He would organize touch football games and was a family man who loved spending times with his sons.

Wilson will be buried at Fernwood Cemetery, in Lansdowne, Pennsylvania, according to the Philadelphia Daily News.
