Huma Abedin has yet to decide whether she will stay with her disgraced husband and her longtime boss Hillary Clinton.

Abedin has worked for Mrs Clinton for more than 15 years and it is believed that the former first lady gave her an ultimatum, saying that either she ditches husband Anthony Weiner or she will not hold a high office in Clinton's expected 2016 campaign.

'Hillary is horrified by Weiner, and thinks that he is an embarrassment to his accomplished wife. She wants Huma to leave him behind. But Huma is torn between her family and loyalty to Hillary,' an unidentified source told The New York Post.

Turning point: Huma Abedin defended her husband at this July 23 press conference following more revelations about his sexting habits but then she was rarely seen on the trail. He went on to lose the race by a massive margin

Weiner's sexting problem first prompted his resignation from Congress in 2011, but it also led to his dramatic downfall in this year's mayoral primaries.

Sticking together: Abedin and Weiner have a son, Jordan, which will weigh in her decision whether or not to leave the marriage

He decided to compete to be the next Mayor of New York City and Abedin was largely at his side for the beginning of the campaign.

She even stood by him and made a public statement defending him when his latest sexting partner Sydney Leathers released transcripts of their conversations and pictures of his genitals that he sent to her.

The Clintons were very clear that they were actively staying out of the city's Democratic primary race since they had close ties to a number of the candidates- including both Weiner via Abedin and the winner Bill de Blasio who helped run Clinton's senate campaign in 2000.

While they may have been remaining neutral while Weiner was in the race, multiple reports have hinted that they are decidedly against Weiner now that he both embarrassed himself in the polls and Abedin in the process.

The unnamed Clinton source reportedly told The Post that if Abedin chooses to stay with her husband, she will be 'looked after' and still be given a job with Clinton's campaign.

That said, the role would be less high profile than it could be, as many would expect Abedin to be Clinton's top campaign manager or chief of staff given how closely they have worked in the past.

A representative for Clinton said that the reports of an ultimatum are 'totally false'.

Laying the groundwork: Since leaving her post as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton has been ramping up her public appearances which many have seen as her approach towards a White House run

Abedin is one of Hillary Clinton's most trusted advisers and would be expected to be a key part of her team if she enters the 2016 presidential race

As for notoriously private Abedin, actions may be speaking louder than words as she was never seen at her husband's campaign events following the Leathers revelations and she was pointedly out of the city on the primary Election Day.

Â She wasn't completely out of the loop, however, as she did attend the consolation party that Weiner held at his brother's restaurant last week.
