David Beckham took his wife Victoria along to his favourite SoulCycle fitness class in Brentwood on Thursday. 

And the former Spice Girl, 40, found a way to cool down after the vigorous class by accepting the ALS ice bucket challenge.

Posh's football star husband, 39, and sons Brooklyn, Romeo and Cruz poured not one but two huge buckets of water over the fashion designer by the pool at their LA residence.

Joining the internet craze: Victoria Beckham accepted the ALS ice bucket challenge on Thursday afternoon

Making a splash: The star's boys tipped two huge buckets of water over her

Chilly: The star shrieked after being doused by the cold water

She joined the internet craze by posting the video on Thursday afternoon, saying she accepted the challenge from her pal Eva Longoria (but didn't mention that Mel B had also nominated her.)

She went on to nominate Tom Ford, Katie Holmes and her son Cruz, who was quick to accept.

Posh was still wearing her all black work-out gear after joining David for a spin class that morning.

Challenge accepted: Victoria's son Cruz immediately took on her nomination

David regularly attends the Brentwood classes during his LA stints, occasionally taking along their eldest son, Brooklyn.

The
 couple have been catching up with their various California based 
friends this week - David had dinner with Gordon Ramsay last night while
 Victoria enjoyed a night out with Eva and hairstylist Ken Paves.

Meanwhile, the fashion designer has also been busy auctioning off 600 items from her personal wardrobe in order to raise money for charity mothers2mothers.

She explained to the Daily Telegraph newspaper: 'We went through 20 years of clothes and shoes, hundreds of boxes and rails, and it feels cathartic to have had such a big clear out for such a great cause.

'There was a lot of hilarity, some bad dressing up 'selfies' and a few emotional moments, too.'

The mother-of-four admits it was difficult to part with some of her favourite outfits because they hold such a personal meaning to her, but she doesn't think there's any point hanging on to her clothes when they could benefit a great cause.

Victoria said: 'I'm very blessed that I've got a beautiful daughter to hand lots of things down to. But out there in a world where mothers are trying to prevent the transmission of HIV/AIDS to their own unborn babies, and where mothers are struggling to get the medication for their own daughters, these clothes have more value being sold online than sitting in a closet for another 20 years waiting for Harper to take an interest.'

Victoria's sale began on Wednesday on TheOutnet.com.
