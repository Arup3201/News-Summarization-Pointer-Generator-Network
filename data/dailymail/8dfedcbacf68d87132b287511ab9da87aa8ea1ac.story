A woman has called for her house to be knocked down after it was hit by passing vehicles 50 times in ten years.

Hairdresser Sandra Worrall is begging Somerset County Council to buy her home in Wheddon Cross so they can bulldoze it and widen the road.

The property has suffered thousands of pounds worth of damage and is now uninsurable against impact.

Constant danger: Sandra Worrall's house has been struck by passing motorists 50 times in a decade, including five times in one month

Mrs Worrall said: ‘I don’t want to move from here but I just don’t know how much more I can take. I’m a nervous wreck.’

Since she and her family moved in 12 years ago, the house has been struck by lorries an average of four times a year. Last October, it took five hits in one month.

The latest incident, last week, saw part of the roof and corner wall of her son’s bedroom taken off.

'We’ve been raising this problem for years but we have got nowhere with Somerset County Council,' she said.

'This junction simply cannot take 16-wheel vehicles - in fact even the 12-wheel ones struggle to negotiate it.

'I’m absolutely fed up and a nervous wreck over this and I want something done about it.'

Damaged: A crumbling section of Sandra Worrall's house, which has now been rendered uninsurable because it has been hit by drivers so many times

Plea: Sandra Worrall has seen her house, on the corner of this junction, smashed by passing cars an incredible 50 times in the last decade

Mrs Worrall has told the county council that she wants large vehicles diverted to another route.

'Failing that I’ve asked the council if it will buy our house, knock it down and improve the road,' she said.

'We’ve been hit at 4am in the morning, late at night - in fact at all times of the day and night.

'And sometimes the drivers involved can be quite aggressive and refuse to give their names.

‘We really need a structural engineer to assess the current state of the building but we can’t afford to get one in because we can’t get insurance.'

Although there are signs at the junction advising vehicles Sandra insists these are ambiguous and do not make the difficulties clear.

'I’m just so fed up with the situation and there seems no way out of it,' she said.

A county council spokesman said the authority was sorry to hear about the latest incident.

'In recent months we have carried out some works to the road surface on he B3224 outside this house to assist with matters,' he said.

'The county council is working with local councillors and the parish council to see if improvements can be made to the road signage to improve the situation here.'
