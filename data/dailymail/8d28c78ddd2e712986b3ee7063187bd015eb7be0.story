The heartbroken sister of murdered April Jones has said she feels she 'should have done more' to stay with the schoolgirl on the night she went missing.

Jazmin Jones was speaking just days after watching workmen bulldoze the 'house from hell' in Ceinws, mid-Wales, where Mark Bridger is thought to have killed April.

Now 19, the media studies student has revealed the last few moments she shared with her five-year-old sister before she was abducted on October 1, 2012.

And she has told of her anguish at not staying with the youngster later on that day, like she normally would have done.

She told The Sun: 'I feel I should've done more that night she went missing. I was the big sister and I normally stayed with her on a Monday night.'

Jazmin recalled how she went to meet April and their mother at a local leisure centre and helped her sister get changed. They then all met up in a cafe.

The teenager then left to meet friends at a youth centre. The last words she said to her little sister were 'I love you'.

Just hours later she received a call from her panic-stricken mother Carol who was crying: 'She's gone, she's gone'.

Remorseless: Bridger has never admitted April's murder and will remain behind bars for the rest of his life

Bridger, 49, abducted April as she played with friends near her home on the Bryn Y Gog estate in Machynlleth that night.

He is believed to have lured the child into his Land Rover before driving her away.

The former abattoir worker is thought to have killed the girl inside his rented cottage after he snatched her from outside her family’s home. 

Traces of her blood and fragments of a child’s skull were discovered inside the cottage, despite Bridger’s desperate attempts to clean up.

He is then thought to have dumped her body, which has never been found despite a huge search operation – and he remains the only person who knows what happened inside the house or where her remains are hidden.

During his trial, Bridger claimed he knocked her over in his Land Rover and then ‘forgot’ what he did with her body. 

Last week, April's family huddled together as they watched workmen rip down the whitewashed cottage they dubbed 'the house from hell'

The murderer was handed a whole-life sentence for the killing.

Jazmin was inseparable from her little sister and shared a bedroom with the youngster - even though there was a 12-year age gap. 

She told the Sun: 'I always thought we'd be doing things together. I imagined going shopping for her wedding dress; her coming to stay at mine after a night out; going through boyfriend dramas.

'Those gaps will never be filled but April will always be part of me wherever life takes me.'
