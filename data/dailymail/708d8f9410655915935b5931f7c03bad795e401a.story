Patricia Hewiston was unwittingly growing cannabis in her garden after a rogue seed from a bird feed fell and started thriving 

It didn’t look out of place among the petunias in green-fingered grandmother Patricia Hewitson’s front garden.

The 5ft plant had plenty of foliage, pretty patterns on the leaves, and it seemed to thrive in a spot where others had perished.

There was just one problem. It was a cannabis plant.

And her unwitting cultivation of such a fine specimen brought the attention of the law after she had it identified by her local radio gardening programme.

Mrs Hewitson sent a picture of the mysterious plant to the BBC’s appropriately named Potting Shed, after suspecting all was not as it seemed.

The show’s resident experts immediately recognised it as cannabis – and the programme dutifully forwarded the photo to police.

‘Oh dear,’ Mrs Hewitson was heard to say on air when told what she had produced.

Yesterday the 65-year-old retired health visitor had chopped up the rogue plant and was preparing to dispose of it in accordance with police instructions.

Mrs Hewitson and her husband John, a 70-year-old retired marine biologist, first noticed the plant in July in the front garden of their home in Exmouth, Devon.

‘It popped up between my petunias,’ Mrs Hewitson said. ‘I just left it there and it grew and grew ... and grew.

‘It was quite useful because it filled a rather difficult space, but in a couple of months it was almost as tall as I am.’

The former health visitor sent a photograph of the plant in to The Potting Shed (right) so experts may be able to identify it 

The plant is thought to have sprouted from a hemp seed in an RSPB-approved mix the couple used in a bird feeder. It took root in a flower-bed less than 15ft from the pavement – in full view of passing pedestrians.  

None commented on what it might be (‘And no one asked me to sell them any,’ Mrs Hewitson added). But she did notice ‘a sickly sweet pong’, and became suspicious.

The grandmother of five posted a picture of it on Facebook and invited friends to identify it. ‘They all said, “No, no, it’s not cannabis”, and sent me the names of all sorts of plants they thought it could be. I wanted to be sure so I emailed a photo to the Potting Shed team.

‘I don’t mind that they told the police – it actually put my mind at rest. They accepted that I wasn’t intentionally cultivating it and said I wouldn’t be prosecuted if I destroyed it.

‘I did get an email asking if they could come and look in my loft though – but I live in a flat, and I haven’t got a loft.’

Police confirmed that although an offence had been committed, there were mitigating circumstances, and no charges would be brought. 

Mrs Hewitson said she had no idea the plant would be able to flourish in 'dear old Devon' but had once seen it in South Africa 

Cannabis plants are usually grown indoors in the UK with the help of fluorescent lamps and a controlled temperature gauge.

But they can  tolerate slightly harsher conditions and will thrive as long as they remain sheltered from the elements.

The growing season in the UK is rather short as cannabis is essentially a tropical plant.

Cannabis is induced to flower when the daylight has reduced to about 13 hours per day. 

This happens  during September, but the plant has only six to 10 weeks flowering time before the first frost kills the plant.

September and October can also be cold and wet, increasing the chances of fungus and disease ruining the crop. 

There are varieties bred especially for outdoor growing in Northern Europe, but these tend to give poorer results than the best indoor or greenhouse types. 

The ideal grow site should get unrestricted sun for as much of the day as possible and protection from strong winds.

With excellent growing conditions, Cannabis has been known to grow six inches a day, although the rate is more commonly one to two inches.

The optimum temperature is 27C to 30C, so this is possible during the height of summer in the UK.

Under the advice of local police the plant has been removed and destroyed. Mrs Hewitson will not be prosecuted
