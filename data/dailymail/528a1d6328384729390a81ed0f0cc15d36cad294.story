If there's one person who knows how to power dress, it's Carol Vorderman.

At 53, the former Countdown presenter has never looked better so it comes as no surprise that isme.com has invited her to front its range for a second year running.

The TV presenter, who has worked with the clothing brand since February 2013, is modelling the AW14 collection, which includes sumptuous faux fur, checks, plaids and winter florals.

Looking good! Carol Vorderman has been unveiled as the face of Isme's AW14 range (leather jacket, £140, vest top, £5, pink capri pants, £29, clutch bag, £16)

Speaking to MailOnline about the new range, Carol said: 'There's plenty of leather, which I love, as well as fabulous Christmas dresses. I absolutely love the longer skirts as I think they're much more elegant.'

Sharing her summer style tips, Carol, who says she 'doesn't like to dress up too much' in the hotter climes, said: 'I love high-waisted trousers and shorter summer dresses. I think it's so important to just be comfortable in what you're wearing.

'Don't look at a 6ft 2in skinny model and think "I want to look like her" - look to people who are your shape and emulate them.'

Isme's latest collection aims to stay 
true to the brand's ethos with a range that’s designed to add style to a woman's everyday life, whatever your age or size - something Carol knows all about.

Carol has become an unofficial postergirl for mature women and is never afraid to experiment with her style or embrace more daring outfits.

Poster girl: Carol has long maintained that fashion isn't about age and believes you should dress however you like (blue blouse, £29, pencil skirt, £20, red peep toe heels, £30)

How does she do it? Despite being over fifty, Carol looks younger than ever. Her secret? A few sessions with a personal trainer and a simple beauty regime (pink shift dress, £39, bracelet, £25)

'I lived through the sexist 70s,' she explained. 'I just wear what makes me feel psychologically comfortable, fashion isn't about your age; I'm a strong believer in that. Life isn't over at fifty!'

Carol cites her style icons as Nicole Schzeringer, although says she 'couldn't look 1 per cent as good as she does', as well as 'incredible' Christie Brinkley, Victoria Beckham and Sophia Loren, who she describes as a 'goddess'.

While she loves to dress up, Carol maintains that she's a 'five-minute make-up' kind of girl and likes to keep her beauty regime simple.

High flier: Carol has just qualified as a pilot and is about to embark on a solo round the world trip (jumpsuit, £29)

When it comes to fitness, Carol says she is very 'off and on' with her exercise regime because she spends a lot of time travelling.

'I am starting back at the gym but I find it very boring and that's why I need a personal trainer. I have also downloaded some really good apps on my phone and if I'm told what to do, I do it,' she said.

As well as modelling for Isme, Carol has just trained to become a pilot and is preparing to fly around the world solo.

'I have also been in discussions for a new TV series but I'm not going to overdo that side of work,' she said.

Then and now: Carol, pictured, left, last week and, right, in the 80s, says she lived through sexist eras and now wants to wear whatever she likes
