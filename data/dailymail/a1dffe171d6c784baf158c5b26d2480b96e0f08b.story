Middle class taxpayers earning an average annual salary of £50,000 will pay twice as much in welfare contributions over the course of their career than they will to health care.

Professionals earning £50,000 over a 43-year career will contribute £219,039 to the Treasury's welfare and pension budget but just £109, 821 to the NHS.

But they have just a small chance of seeing any return for their welfare payments.

Contributions: The average tax payment to different Treasury budgets based on an average annual salary of £50,000

Breakdown: HMRC will send every taxpayer details of exactly where their annual tax payments go next year

According to the Government's own state pension calculator, a worker who is 30 today will not receive pension payments until they are 68.

So, a 30-year-old who will earn an average annual salary of £50,000 will have to live to the age of 106 to become a net beneficiary.

Earners on the same wage will also contribute more than £80,000 to the education budget, pay off more than £42,000 of the national debt, and put more than £35,000 into the UK defence budget.

Transparency: Treasury Minister David Gauke has welcomed Treasury plans to send all taxpayers a breakdown of where their contributions go

A higher earner on an average wage of £100,000 will contribute £550,000 to welfare and only £274,168, according to the Daily Telegraph.

The Treasury is preparing to send all taxpayers a breakdown of where their annual tax contributions end up next year.

The figures were compiled by the newspaper using figures from HM Revenue & Customs that show how much of a person's income tax and National Insurance contributions go towards each of 13 different state budgets.

Figures do not include indirect taxes such as VAT.

Those who earned £50,000 in 2012-13 will have paid £14,032 in national insurance and income tax.

More than £5,000 of that will have been paid into the welfare budget compared to just £2,554 on the NHS.

Treasury minister David Gauke has welcomed plans to send taxpayers a breakdown of how their hard earned money is spent.

He told the DailyTelegraph: 'It is quite right that people know how much tax they pay and what it is spent on.

'From 2014, the new personalised tax statements will make the system even clearer and more transparent.'

But there is fear that rather than justifying the Conservatives arguments to cap benefit payments, the figures will only serve to anger the middle classes.
