The White House refused on Monday to formally call on House Republicans to throw their No. 3 in command, Steve Scalise, out of House leadership but repeatedly claimed it 'says a lot' about the GOP that they would allow the Louisiana lawmaker to remain front and center.

'Who they choose to serve in their leadership says a lot about who they are and what their values should be,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said.

Twice he referenced a comment Scalise reportedly make nearly 20 years about being 'David Duke without the baggage.' Duke is a former KKK leader and and heads the white supremacist group that Scalise says he inadvertently spoke to a decade ago.

Draw your own conclusions: White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said on Monday that the controversy surrounding Louisiana lawmaker Steve Scalise 'says a lot' about the GOP but he wouldn't tell them what he meant by that

Republican leaders had hoped that the controversy surrounding Scalise, who since apologized for speaking to Duke's organization, EURO, in 2002 and has condemned it as a hate group, would dissipate over the holiday break.

House Speaker John Boehner and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor came to Scalise's defense last month as the conflict took shape, giving him the full weight of their support. 

Incoming Rep. Mia Love of Utah, the first black female to represent Republicans in Congress, said Sunday that she had no issues with Scalise.

'I believe he should remain in leadership,' Love said on ABC News' Sunday morning program This Week.

'There's one quality that he has that I think is very important in leadership, and that's humility. And he's actually shown that in this case. 

'And he's apologized, and I think that we need to move on and get the work of the American people done,' she added.

Louisiana's sole Democratic representative, Cedric Richmond, who is also black, has also backed Scalise.

'I don't think Steve Scalise has a racist bone in his body,' Richmond told New Orleans publication The Times-Picayune.

But as members returned to Washington on Monday and Republicans prepared to take control of both chambers of Congress or the first time in eight years, the dust had yet to settle. 

The scandal bled into its second week on Monday, with high-profile Democrats doubling down on their denunciations of Scalise.

'As the new Congress begins, nothing discredits Republican claims of outreach and bringing people together more than their decision to keep Steve Scalise at the top tier of the elected leadership of their caucus,' Democratic National Committee Chair and Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz said in a statement. 

Continuing, Wasserman Schultz said, 'Anyone living in this century should have known better than to attend and speak at a white supremacist event, particularly one founded and led by David Duke, and Scalise’s explanation that he wasn’t aware isn’t credible by a long shot.

'But when House Republicans stand by him years later, and GOP White House hopefuls defend or refuse to speak out, they legitimize his actions,' she charged, calling on all potential Republican presidential candidates to 'publicly condemn Scalise.'

I am not a racist: House Majority Whip Steve Scalise says he didn't realize that he was speaking to a white supremacist group when he gave the 2002 speech at the center of a scandal plaguing both him and the Republican Party. But the Democratic National Committee said on Monday that 'anyone living in this century should have known better'

Attacking newly elected New York Rep. Lee Zeldin for his assertion Sunday that the ongoing coverage of the Scalise speech is the fault of the 'mainstream media who look for any opportunity to try to tear down Republicans to help back up the President of the United States and the Democrats in Congress,' the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee on Monday called his decision to advocate for Scalise 'mind-blowing.'

'Scalise’s ally David Duke has attacked “Zionists” as responsible for this negative story and the Anti-Defamation League says Duke is anti-semetic and that Scalise had legitimized Duke’s views by speaking there,' the DCCC said in a statement.

The DCCC's Jesse Ferguson said Zeldin 'chose to relentlessly defend his leader who trolls for votes at anti-Semitic white supremacist rallies.'

The White House took a less aggressive approach at criticizing Scalise on Monday when responding to questions from reporters.

'There is no arguing that who Republicans decide to elevate into a leadership position says a lot about what the conference's priorities and values are,' Earnest said in his first briefing of the New Year.

'We've heard a lot from Republicans particularly over the last few years, including the chairman of the Republican Party, about how Republicans need to broaden their appeal to young people and to women, to gays and to minorities, that the success of their party will depend on their ability to broaden that outreach,' he added.

'So it ultimately will be up to individual Republicans in Congress to decide whether or not elevating Mr. Scalise into leadership will effectively reinforce that strategy.'

Earnest would not explain what he meant when he stated numerous times that the Scalise episode 'says a lot' about the GOP, however, leaving reporters to draw their own conclusions.
