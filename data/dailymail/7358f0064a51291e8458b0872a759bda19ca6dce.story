It gets into your blood, consuming your thoughts and inducing panic attacks if the next fix is not in sight.

On a good day, it might offer a harmless escape from the troubles of the world. But on a bad, it can turn into a monstrous distraction, rendering you unable to concentrate on work or studies.

The drug is Facebook, and if you fear you may be an addict, now is the time to find out.

Fake Facebook profiles were found to be posting malicious links to brand pages such as the U.S National Football League page. When these links were clicked on it would install a computer virus called the Zeus Banking Trojan onto the user's PC

Here are six basic statements. Answer from the following scale: 1 = Very rarely; 2 = Rarely; 3 = Sometimes; 4 = Often and 5 = Very often.

You spend a lot of time thinking about Facebook or plan use of Facebook.

You feel an urge to use Facebook more and more.

You use Facebook in order to forget about personal problems.

You have tried to cut down on the use of Facebook without success.

You become restless or troubled if you are prohibited from using Facebook.

You use Facebook so much that it has had a negative impact on your job/studies.

If you score 4 (often) or 5 (always) on at least four of these six points, then you could be addicted to Facebook.

Researchers tested a scientific scale on 423 students which measures how hooked users are.

They found women are more at risk of addiction because of the social nature of the site.

The Norwegian team found ambitious 
types are less likely to become addicted as they take advantage of the 
site for their own purposes, such as work and networking.

The Bergen Facebook Addiction Scale 
lets users measure their dependency on the social networking site by 
answering six basic questions with how closely they reflect their 
behaviour.

Those who answer ‘often’ or ‘very often’ to at least four of 
the questions are considered addicted.

The scale is based on the same six 
core elements of addiction used by doctors to identify alcoholics and 
drug users, the journal Psychological Reports said.

Lead researcher Dr Cecilie Schou 
Andreassen, of the University of Bergen’s Faculty of Psychology, said 
addiction is more common among younger users.

‘We have also found that people who 
are anxious and socially insecure use Facebook more than those with 
lower scores on those traits,’ she added.

She said this could be because
 anxious people find it easier to communicate through social media than 
face to face.

And users who are late to go to bed 
and get up are more likely to be addicted as those with a ‘delayed sleep
 wake rhythm’ scored highly, she said.

Brain scans of social network users have shown that using sharing sites such as Facebook 'fires up' the same reward channels in the brain as are activated by sex.

Diana Tamir, of the Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience Lab at Harvard scanned users of social networks using Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and found that sharing information about themselves triggered the same neural pathways as food, money and sex.

Interestingly, participants in the study also said they would pay money to tell others about themselves - although some might argue that Facebook's ever-more-intrusive adverts mean they already DO pay.

Dr Andreassen said: ‘The use of 
Facebook has increased rapidly.

'We are dealing with a subdivision of 
internet addiction connected to social media.’some users, Facebook can 
be as addictive as any drug - and now scientists have designed a simple 
test to root out addicts from ordinary users.

Occasionally doing this, for instance to try and encourage replies from business contacts, is fine. But a constant need to do this could border on addiction.

The results from the student volunteers suggested Facebook addiction was more common among younger adults and women rather than men.

It was more prevalent among those who are 'anxious and socially insecure' as they are often too introverted to speak in person but happy to maintain an online contact.
