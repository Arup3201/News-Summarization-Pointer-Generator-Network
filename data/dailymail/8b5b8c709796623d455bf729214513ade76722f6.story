A part of a Thomas Cook aeroplane that 'fell off' shortly after departing Gatwick Airport has been recovered.

The emergency escape slide was found in the village of Langton Green, Kent, and has been passed on to Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) by Kent Police. 

The Egypt-bound Thomas Cook aircraft with 237 passengers on board had to turn back and land at Gatwick Airport on Friday when the slide came off.

Staff noticed the fault over Belgium, but the piece was believed to have fallen off not long after take-off from the West Sussex airport.

The vicar at All Saints' Church in Langton Green found an 'unusual' 2ft piece of metal found in a churchyard, but Thomas Cook has not commented on whether this is linked to the escape slide.

A spokesperson for Thomas Cook Airlines said: 'We are aware that the slide has now been located near Tunbridge Wells and we are working with the AAIB and local police to ensure that it is retrieved and made available to the investigation team', said a spokesperson for Thomas Cook Airlines.

'We are not able to comment further on the identity of the piece of metal found in the village.' 

Kent Police said officers picked up the item and handed it to investigators at the Civil Aviation Authority for it to be verified.

Rev Michael Gentry said: 'It was an unusual piece of metal, around 2ft long, so it may have been part of it.

'It was right by the gates, so it may have fallen in the road and someone placed it there out of the way. It had had an impact with something. Nothing was damaged in the churchyard.' 

The passenger jet TCX1638 left Gatwick Airport on Friday morning bound for Hurghada with 237 passengers on board.

The AAIB is investigating the incident and Thomas Cook also said it had begun a full investigation. None of the passengers were injured.

A Thomas Cook Airlines statement said: 'We can confirm that flight TCX1638, from Gatwick to Hurghada, returned to the airport after a short time into the flight after a fault was reported with an over wing slide.

'Whilst airborne, the slide unit has fallen from the aircraft and we are aware that local police have been informed.

'The aircraft landed safely at Gatwick Airport and we are now immediately undertaking a full investigation and working with the airline authorities.

'We'd like to apologise to our customers for the delay to their flight.'

Passengers departed on a replacement flight that afternoon. The airline has not yet revealed what kind of plane was involved in the incident. 

A Gatwick Airport spokesman said on Friday: 'We can confirm that Thomas Cook flight TCX1638 returned to London Gatwick earlier this morning due to an issue with the aircraft.

'Passengers have now disembarked and are being helped by staff while the issue is investigated.'

The AAIB confirmed: 'The AAIB has deployed a team to London Gatwick Airport to investigate an incident to an airliner.'
