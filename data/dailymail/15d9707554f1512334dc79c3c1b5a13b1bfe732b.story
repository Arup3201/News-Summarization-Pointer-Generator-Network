A new reality series will send one winning celebrity contestant to the stars - literally.

Milky Way Mission will follow ten stars through astronaut bootcamp, with the winner getting the chance to be a passenger in a real space launch.

And incredibly its not the only reality series planning to offer a winner a chance to go into orbit, with the producer behind The Voice and Survivor pitching his own unscripted series.

Out of this world: A scale model of the Space Expedition Corporations spaceship, which is set to launch in 2014 and will carry the winner of a reality television series planned by Sony Pictures Television

Sony's TV division is set to announce its Milky Way Mission collaboration with the Netherlands-based Space Expedition Corporation (SXC) at this year's MIPCOM industry event, Deadline reports.

SXC is one of several private firms which, like Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic, hopes to offer civilian trips to space by next year.

Created by Tuvalu Media and Simpel Media, Milky Way Mission will follow 10 celebrities as they undergo rigorous and intensive training to prepare them for their space adventure.

In a format reminiscent of I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here, the contestants will face a series of extreme mental and physical challenges as they battle to win the grand prize.

They will be in interesting company, for it emerged last month that among the well-heeled customers hoping to board SXC's first flight are Boomtown Rats singer Bob Geldof, dance music DJ Armin Van Buuren and Victoria's Secret model Doutzen Kroes.

Flights start at $100,000, with up to 100 people set to take part in the project in its inauguration next year. Dutch television channel Nederland 1 has already reportedly commissioned eight hour-long episodes of the linked reality show.

SpaceShipTwo: SXC's mission is in competition with Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic, which has signed up a deal to with another television producer for a rival fly on the wall series that doesn't feature celebrities

Wayne Garvie, chief creative officer of international production at Sony Pictures Television, told Deadline: 'For years people have dreamt about the possibility of a show in space.

'SPT is now poised to make that dream real.'

But it does not have the luxury of an open playing field. Mark Burnett, the creative visionary behind The Voice, is also producing his own series which will send one lucky winner into orbit.

That programme, produced in collaboration with Virgin Galactic, will secure a ticket for a reportedly non-celebrity contestant for a seat aboard Sir Richard's SpaceShipTwo.
