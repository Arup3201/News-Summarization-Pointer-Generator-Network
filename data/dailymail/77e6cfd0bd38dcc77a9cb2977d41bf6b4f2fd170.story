Martin Odegaard is expected to finally announce a move to Real Madrid next week.

The 16-year-old Stromsgodset midfielder has been on a tour of Europe's top clubs.

Odegaard was even praised by Real star Cristiano Ronaldo, who claimed his third Ballon d'Or award last week. 

'[He is a] good player. He's a young boy who can still grow - he's 16 years old,' said Ronaldo.

'He has a good future. We must give him time to learn and to take the best decisions, but I see a lot of potential in the player. [He has a] good left foot.'

Odegaard watched from the stands as Real lost to city rivals Atletico last week after he flew to Spain for advanced talks.

The teenage sensation has also been linked with Bayern Munich, Liverpool, Barcelona and both Manchester clubs, but looks poised to move to Madrid instead.
