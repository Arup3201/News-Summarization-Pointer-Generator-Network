A judge has ordered a Texas hospital to remove life support for a pregnant, brain-dead woman.

Judge R. H. Wallace Jr. issued the ruling Friday in the case of Marlise Munoz. John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth has been keeping Munoz on life support against her family's wishes.

Munoz was 14 weeks pregnant when her husband found her unconscious November 26, possibly due to a blood clot.

Tragedy: Erick found Marlise unconscious on the kitchen floor in late November. She'd likely suffered an embolism that cut off oxygen to her brain. She was 14 weeks pregnant and has never regained consciousness

Questions: In Texas, state law stipulates that, 
in cases of pregnant women, DNRs do not apply and all measures must be 
taken to save the life of the fetus

Erick Munoz says he and his wife are 
paramedics who were clear that they didn't want life support in this 
type of situation. His attorney argued that keeping the woman alive 
would set a dangerous precedent.

But John Peter Smith Hospital had argued that it had to protect the life of the unborn child.

Hospital officials have said they were bound by a state law prohibiting withdrawal of treatment from a pregnant patient. Several experts interviewed by The Associated Press have said the hospital is misapplying the law.

The case has raised questions about end-of-life care and whether a pregnant woman who is considered legally and medically dead should be kept on life support for the sake of a fetus. It also has gripped attention on both sides of the abortion debate, with anti-abortion groups arguing Munoz's fetus deserves a chance to be born.

Earlier this week, Erick Munoz's attorneys said that the fetus, now believed to be at about 22 weeks' gestation, is 'distinctly abnormal.' They attorneys said they based that statement on medical records they received from the hospital.

First child: Munoz with her first baby. She was pregnant with her second when she collapsed in November

The Tarrant County District Attorney's Office, which is representing the hospital in the lawsuit, said the hospital was expected to issue a statement later Friday in response to the ruling.

Not much is known about fetal survival when mothers suffer brain death during pregnancy. German doctors who searched for such cases found 30 of them in nearly 30 years, according to an article published in the journal BMC Medicine in 2010.

Those mothers were further along in pregnancy - 22 weeks on average - when brain death occurred than in the Texas case. Birth results were available for 19 cases. In 12, a viable child was born. Follow-up results were available for six, all of whom developed normally.

 Munoz was hooked up to machines in a Fort Worth hospital as her
 husband and the hospital were locked in a court battle about whether to 
retain life support.

Erick Munoz said his wife, a fellow paramedic, was clear with him before he found her unconscious on November 26: If she ever fell into this kind of condition, pull life support.

Munoz's attorneys, Heather King and Jessica Hall Janicek, issued a statement Wednesday describing the condition of the fetus, now believed to be at about 22 weeks' gestation. King and Janicek based their statement on medical records they received from the hospital.

'According to the medical records we have been provided, the fetus is distinctly abnormal,' the attorneys said. 'Even at this early stage, the lower extremities are deformed to the extent that the gender cannot be determined.'

The attorneys said the fetus also has fluid building up inside the skull and possibly has a heart problem.

Normal heartbeat: Doctors previously said that the baby has a normal heartbeat and had the potential to be carried to full term

'Quite sadly, this information is not surprising due to the fact that the fetus, after being deprived of oxygen for an indeterminate length of time, is gestating within a dead and deteriorating body, as a horrified family looks on in absolute anguish, distress and sadness,' the attorneys said.

Spokeswomen for the hospital and the Tarrant County District Attorney's office, which is representing the hospital in the lawsuit, declined to comment Wednesday.

A hearing in the case is scheduled for Friday. Munoz's lawsuit asks a judge to order the hospital to pull life support and return Marlise Munoz's body to her family.

Several experts have said the Texas Advance Directives Act doesn't apply in this case because Marlise Munoz, having suffered brain death, is legally and medically dead â€” a key argument in Erick Munoz's lawsuit.

Munoz previously told the AP he wasn't confident about the health of the fetus. His wife was 14 weeks pregnant when he found her unconscious in November, possibly from a blood clot.

A 2010 article in the journal BMC Medicine found 30 cases of brain-dead pregnant women over about 30 years. Of 19 reported results, the journal found 12 in which a viable child was born and had post-birth data for two years on only six of them â€” all of whom developed normally, according to the journal.

I don't agree with this law': Erick said he was unable to fulfill his promise to his wife because of the Texas law, which applies to all pregnant women, even those with do not resuscitate orders

'We knew what her wishes were': Both Erick and Marlise were both paramedics. He found her collapsed on November 26 and initiated CPR, but it was no use. Erick says the couple had seen enough in the line of duty to know they wouldn't want to be kept alive by machines
