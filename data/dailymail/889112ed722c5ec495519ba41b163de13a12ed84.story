Watch out, ladies. David Gandy is after your... shoes!

The handsome supermodel, 33, is the star of a very saucy new advert for luxury shoe brand Bionda Castana.

The film follows a besuited Gandy in a hotel bar exchanging smouldering glances with various beautiful women wearing fabulous shoes.

Atmospheric classical piano pieces by Debussy and Bonobo make up the musical backdrop.

The women knowingly lure him in using their sexy shoes... but what they don't know is that David has a sneaky plan too.

David meanders up to a hotel room with each of the women, playfully seducing them, removing their clothes, kissing on the bed - and slowly removing their heels - before embarking upon a steamy session between the sheets.

As the women wake the following morning, having had their way with the Essex-born model, they realise their favourite heels are missing.

The film cuts back to when the shoes were thrown on a table or chair the previous night - but there's not so much as a trace of their existence the next day.

The film cuts to moody, cigarette-smoking shoe-fetishist David walking away into the sunrise, with a bag of sexy shoes swung over his shoulder.

The women are left furious as David has the last laugh, free to indulge his fetish.

David said the experience of making the film had been enlightening - and said he loves the confidence a great pair of shoes gives a woman.

'Whilst filming, I've learned a lot about the emotional attachment women have with their shoes and about how their shoes can affect how they feel,' he told MailOnline.

'In the film, I couldn't resist finding out more about the woman behind her chosen shoes - the shoes acted as an aphrodisiac.

'It's no secret that for years, there's been something sensual for men about women's footwear. I always notice a woman's shoes. I like a stiletto heel and individuality in style.

'The confidence a pair of shoes can give to someone - changing their walk, their posture and even their confidence - is intriguing. And a confident woman, is an attractive woman.'

Cheeky: While a smug lady is pleased to have snared him with her shoes, he plans to run off with them
