With white sandy beaches, crystal-clear waters and unadulterated solitude, a private island is most people's vision of paradise.

But all may not be as it seems as a number of private islands languish on the market and experts warn that some buyers are realizing that the hassle of living on one is more than it is worth.

There are now 600 islands up for sale around the world, according to experts, from the Caribbean to the chillier waters of northern Scotland, ranging in price from $50,000 to $100 million. The number of isles on the market has jumped three-fold since 2006.

A number of stunning island properties have also been on the market for some time.

The spectacular Petra Island near New York City has been for sale for years, and comes complete with a stunning home designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. The price is only available on request. Allen Island off the coast of Washington state first appeared on the market for $25m in 2005 and the owners are now asking $13.5m.

Island broker Farhad Vladi told The Sunday Times: 'Some celebrities are getting out of the the market as quickly as they can.'

But any dampening of enthusiasm from buyers has not deterred realtors, as this summer more stunning island homes have hit the market including Florida's Little Bokeelia island which is on sale for $29.5million.

It appears that the rich and famous who stump up the millions required for their own Robinson Crusoe experience, haven't bargained for trouble in paradise - which often includes no electricity, bureaucratic red tape, endangered species and exorbitant maintenance costs.

Lap of luxury: Petra Island, '15 minutes by helicopter' from New York City, has languished on the property market for years despite having buildings designed by Frank Lloyd Wright

Suitable for a Bond villain: The price of Petra Island is only available on request (but if you need to ask, you probably can't afford it)

Rocking pad: Petra Island has a 1,200-square-foot cottage completed in 1949 to the specifications of the legendary designer Frank Lloyd Wright

Quirky: The homes on 11-acre Petra Island incorporate stone, cement and mahogany and are considered architectural masterpieces

British TV presenter Ben Fogle has also warned of the dangers of island ownership.

'A lot of people get seduced by the island dream without thinking of the realities,' he told The Times. He said people forget about the high maintenance costs of islands - including the large amount of rubbish being washed ashore.

Some 12,000 islands have been put up for sale in the past 100 years - but only one thousand have been fully developed to make for comfortable living. Problems include establishing power to remote locations, dealing with off-season storm damage, wild animals and untamed jungle or forest. Endangered species take precedence over indulged celebrity owners.

The
lack of amenities to create the luxury to which they have become 
accustomed, appears to have been a stumbling block for several super-rich
island owners. 

Nicolas Cage got rid of his $3million 
Leaf Cay in the Bahamas after an endangered reptile put paid to his 
hopes for a luxury home. Singer Celine Dion is reportedly trying to sell her island in Canada for close to $30million - although hers does come with a French-style chateau thrown in.

And following the amicable split of Johnny Depp and Vanessa Paradis, Little Halls Pond Cay in the Bahamas could be on the market after it was reported that neither party was interested in keeping the idyllic spot.

Microsoft
billionaire Paul Allen discovered that all the technology in the world 
didn't make it any easier to have his island near Seattle fitted with 
electricity.

Allan 
Island was bought in 1992 by Allen and is currently on the market for 
around $13million for which a buyer will get 292 acres, an airstrip, 
dock and luxury log cabin.

Paradise lost: Allan Island near Seattle, which belongs to the co-founder of Microsoft Paul Allen, was put up for sale for around $13million after the billionaire couldn't bring electricity to it

Isle be off: Paul Allen is said to be off loading Allan Island for around $13 million because he has been unable to bring electricity to the island

Relatively easier on the bank account is Jonathan Island, a secluded getaway in Rhode Island. For $1.4million, it has a protected wildlife sanctuary along with a modern two-bedroom cottage.  

If your tastes are a little grander then
Little Hawkins Island, Georgia has been heavily developed with a 
spacious home featuring wraparound porches, swimming pool and dock - 
although it is reflected in the price tag of $20million.

Petra Island, a 15-minute jaunt from New York City (if you have a helicopter that is), has been on the market for several years. The 11-acre island has two properties designed by the celebrated Frank Lloyd Wright incorporating mahogany, cement and stone into the striking structures. A cottage was finished in 1949 while the larger, 5,000 sq ft residence was completed in 2007 from drawings.

The price of Petra Island is only available on request (but if you need to ask, you probably can't afford it).

Florida's Little Bokeelia Island combines a picturesque property with blissful solitude - but there is nothing small about the price tag. The 104-acre island will set you back $29.5million.

Boat required: For those who want to get away from everyone, Jonathan Island is one of 600 islands up for sale around the world

Getting away from it all: Jonathan Island, in Rhode Island, is on the market for $1.4million and has its own cottage and wildlife sanctuary

On the dock of the bay: Jonathan Island is said to be easily accessibly due to its location on well-protected Point Judith Pond

No neighbors: The solitary cottage on Jonathan Island allows the owner absolute solitude

Life of luxury: Little Hawkins Island, Georgia has been heavily developed with grand home, swimming pool and dock although it is reflected in the price tag of $20million

Southern style: The estate on Little Hawkins Island has been heavily developed adding to its hefty $20million price tag

A-list lifestyle: Complete with chandeliers and luxury interior design, staying on Little Hawkins is far from roughing it in a beach shack

Not so small price tag: Little Bokeelia Island in Florida is on the market for an eye-watering $29.5 million

Picturesque: There is a Spanish-style villa built on the vast island with tiled courtyards and balconies

Great escape: Those with a couple of million to spare can join the Hollywood elite by purchasing their own island like Little Bokeelia

Tucked away: The serenity of island life appeals to many but three times as many islands have been put up sale since 2006 with high maintenance costs to blame
