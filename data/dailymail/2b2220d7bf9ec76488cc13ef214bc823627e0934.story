A 12-month-old baby girl was left with burns on her head and neck after a firework hit her in the face.

The incident was the second firework-related accident to happen to a child in Greater Manchester yesterday after a nine-year-old boy received blast injuries to his hand earlier in the evening.

Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said they were called to Daubhill in Bolton at around 9.20pm last night after the girl was struck in the face by a ‘multi-shot display’ type firework which had fallen over and discharged horizontally.

The girl was treated at the scene and taken to hospital for further treatment.

At 8.34pm fire crews were called by the ambulance service to a separate incident in Ashton-on-Mersey to a report of an injury to a nine-year-old boy caused by an exploding firework.

A spokesman for the fire service said: ‘The injury is thought to have happened when a firework the boy was holding exploded - damaging his hand. The boy was taken to hospital for treatment.’

He was taken to Wythenshawe Hospital for treatment.

Station manager Paul Duggan, of Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, said: 'Two children have been injured and any injury is one too many.

'Therefore we are maintaining our vigilance and will see what Bonfire night itself brings.'

He said apart from the two children injured the rest of Greater Manchester had been relatively quiet.

The incidents came as fire chiefs issued a safety warning ahead of Bonfire Night.

With dry weather forecast and a Saturday Bonfire Night, crews at Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service are expected to have one of their busiest nights in years.

The service received 468 calls last year and attended 327 incidents.

Senior firefighters are warning people to take extra care this year.

They have been working hard to get the safety message to school children.

Mr Duggan said: 'With Bonfire Night taking place on Saturday night, and dry weather forecast, we're anticipating a busier period than the last few years.

'We've made the appropriate preparations - including weeks of visiting schools and hosting community roadshows - to get the safety messages across.

'We want everyone to have a happy and safe Bonfire Night. To ensure this, people can visit the safe4autumn website for sensible tips on how to keep safe.'

They have been using data from previous years to target 'hot spot' areas for anti-social behaviour. Bosses have also used advertising on social-networking sites such as Facebook to get their message across.

Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service is encouraging people to attend organised bonfires and firework displays wherever possible.
