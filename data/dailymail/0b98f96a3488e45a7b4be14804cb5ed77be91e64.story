Anguish: Three more women have made allegations against Bill Roache. This week he was cleared of all charges against him and is set to return to work

The husband of a key witness in the Bill Roache trial says she is planning civil action against him over an alleged sex assault.

The woman, who cannot be identified, is furious at what  she calls an ‘abysmal’ police investigation.

The revelation came as it emerged that several new witnesses have come forward to claim they were sexually assaulted by the Coronation Street actor.

The woman testified during the trial at which Roache was acquitted on all charges, but claims there is evidence which the jury did not hear and she accuses police officers of failing to pursue leads.

Her husband said: ‘We intend to instruct lawyers and will look to bring a civil action against William Roache.

‘My wife feels she was led up the garden path by police.

'They promised various pieces of important evidence would be placed before the court but we never heard any of it.

‘Instead they relied entirely on my wife and other women taking the stand. For instance, there was evidence relating to a gold  Rolls-Royce which she rode in.

‘It was said that the defendant did not have such a car at the time in question.

'The police told us they couldn’t check because DVLA records didn’t go back to the 1960s – but surely inquiries could establish this.

Rovers return: Speaking outside court following his acquittal the 81-year-old said: 'In these situations there are no winners. I would like to get back to work'

‘Why couldn’t they ask questions, wear
 out a bit of shoe leather, instead of just relying on computer records?
 My wife has been honest all the way through. Now she’s been on 
medication since before Christmas and is completely traumatised by what 
has happened.’

Sources close
 to the Roache investigation say that ‘several’ women have contacted 
police but they are unlikely to pursue new claims.

At least three women made their allegations during the actor’s 17-day trial.

It is understood they concern incidents said to have taken place in the late 1960s and  the early 1970s.

One of the women, now married and aged 64, alleges she met the actor when she was a teenage autograph-hunter.

Lancashire Police sources confirmed last night that officers had spoken to each of the new complainants.

However, a detective said: ‘There is no investigation, and there won’t be one.’

Roache’s legal team claimed throughout the trial that he had been targeted as part of a ‘witch-hunt’ against celebrities.

It is an allegation both Lancashire Police and the Crown Prosecution Service deny.

Nazir
 Afzal, the chief prosecutor for the North West, said: ‘When the 
evidence passes the prosecution test it is right that a jury considers 
the evidence. When a jury delivers a verdict, no matter what it is, that
 is justice being done.’
