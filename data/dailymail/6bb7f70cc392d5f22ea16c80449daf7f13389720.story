Family and friends including Spanish sports stars gathered at the funeral of woman racing driver Maria De Villota last night after she was found dead in her hotel room.

Among those who attended the service at the Dominican Church of Madrid, in Spain, was former motorcycle racing champion Angel Nieto and former Spanish racing driver Carlos Sainz. 

Swimmer David Meca paid tribute to De Villota describing her as an 'angel'.

Other athletes who attended were racing drivers Jaime Alguersuari and Carmen Jorda. 

José María Álvarez del Manzano, the former mayor of Madrid between 1991 and 2003, and Ana Botellla, the current mayor of the capital were also at the service.

Some mourners stood outside the church because there was no room inside. 

Maria De Villota died in her hotel room in Seville as a result of a crash at Duxford Aerodrome, in Cambridgeshire, last year, according to her family.

The 33-year-old, who lost her right eye and suffered serious facial injuries during her debut test for Formula One outfit Marussia last July, was found dead in a Spanish hotel room, in Seville, last week.

She was travelling at between 30 and 40mph when she hit a support truck during a straight-line.

De Villota had appeared to make a remarkable recovery from the injuries she sustained in the life-threatening crash ahead of last year's British Grand Prix.

But in a statement released on Saturday, her family have since been told that her death, which has stunned the F1 paddock, is linked to last year's accident.

'Maria left us while she was sleeping, approximately at 6am, as a consequence of the neurological injuries that she suffered in July of 2012, according to what the forensic doctor has told us,' her sister Isabel said in a family statement.

'Maria is gone, but she has left us a very clear message of joy and hope, which is helping the family move on in these moments.'
