A promising jockey allegedly caught masturbating on a woman's balcony was in critical condition today after being shot twice by a resident when he assaulted neighbors as he tried to flee.

Angel Suarez Medero, 21, is a rising star at Parx Casino's racetrack in Philadelphia, having made millions of dollars from his races.

Medero, of Bensalem, was being treated for gunshot wounds to the chest and abdomen after the bizarre incident on Sunday night - soon after his girlfriend claimed that he had been drinking a red-colored liquid and acting strangely.

Angel Suarez Medero, 21, was a rising star on the racetrack in Philadelphia. He was in critical condition with two gunshot wounds after allegedly masturbating on a woman's apartment balcony

Police were alerted on Sunday evening following reports of a man masturbating on the second-floor balcony of an apartment in Bensalem, Philadelphia (pictured)

Police were alerted around 8.30pm to a male suspect, naked from the waist down, and allegedly masturbating on the deck of a second floor apartment in Bensalem. 

'I was sitting on the couch,' said the woman, who was inside the apartment at the time, later told NBC 10.  'My dogs started freaking out. They went up to the door and I looked up and I could see from my living room that there was a man on my deck.'

The resident then said the suspect motioned for her to be quiet as her dogs continued to bark.

'He laid down on the floor, stood back up and then he started masturbating on my deck,' she said. 'I stood there for like ten seconds and I tried to get them to come with me but they wouldn't. Then I got out of there.' 

The female resident called 911 and fled to a neighboring apartment, police said. The suspect then forcefully broke into the apartment through the sliding glass door. 

The suspect then allegedly stole the woman's dog, according to police.

He jumped out of the second-floor bedroom window and  broke into another near-by apartment that was occupied at the time.

Medero was then believed to have assaulted two occupants before being shot twice by one resident during the struggle.

The jockey's girlfriend, Kaylia Albright (pictured) reportedly told Medero's agent that he had been drinking a red-colored drink prior to the incident

Lt. William McVey of Bensalem Police told Daily Mail Online on Tuesday that Medero, who weighs 110lbs, was 'combative' and not cooperating with officers even after he was shot.

The 21-year-old was taken to Aria Torresdale Hospital where he remains in a critical condition on Tuesday.

He was placed in an induced coma and has undergone surgery - and faces further operations - to repair damage to his liver and pancreas.

He will be charged with burglary, assault and related offenses, once his condition improves.  

Resident Evan Greathouse told Philly.com that both of his dogs attacked Suarez, but one of them named Ollie (pictured) has not been seen since

Toxicology reports were being conducted but the results would not be released, Lt McVey told Daily Mail Online.

The jockey's agent, Dave Yannuzzi, said on Tuesday that Medero lives with his girlfriend. Kaylia Albright is also a jockey at Penn National Race Course.  

The couple are believed to live in the same apartment complex where the break-ins took place. 

Mr Yannuzzi, who has been Medero's agent for four months, told Daily Mail Online that the 21-year-old was 'extremely talented... he's a very nice kid, very gentle and kind-hearted.'

He added: 'What happened was absolutely out of character. [Angel] is good to people, good to animals.

'You could have knocked me over with a feather when I found out.' 

Mr Yannuzzi said that the jockey was being held under police guard and that Medero's mother had not been allowed in to see him.

According to Philly.com, Medero's girlfriend reportedly said that he was acting strangely before the incident and was drinking a red-colored liquid.

The agent and others suggested that Suarez could have been on a substance such as bath salts or PCP at the time of the incident. 

Mr Yannuzzi told Daily Mail Online: 'I don't know for a fact if he smoked something or drank something.'

The agent said he was unaware of his jockey ever having been in trouble with police in the past, other than traffic tickets.

Resident Evan Greathouse told Philly.com that both of his dogs attacked Suarez, but one of them named Ollie, a long-haired dachshund, has not been seen since.

The dog is still missing, police said on Tuesday.  

The apartment resident who shot the suspect is cooperating with police and his firearm was legally owned and registered. 

The incident was being investigated by the Bucks County District Attorney's Office. 

Paulick Report said that when Medero was 19 years old, he 'was a finalist for the Eclipse Awards’ Outstanding Apprentice Jockey, having won 142 of his 837 mounts for earnings of $3,366,126.

'This year, Suarez has 58 wins from 539 starts for earnings of $1,446,953.'
