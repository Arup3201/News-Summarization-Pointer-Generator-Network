The ladies who lunch at the Ascot Bar of the Pennyhill Park Hotel were oblivious that one of the most decorated English footballers had just strolled in.

At 6ft 4in, Chelsea and England centre-back Gary Cahill ought to be hard to miss, especially when he is the national team’s vice-captain, having picked up pretty much every club honour in the game.

Win the Premier League in May and he will have the full set - following Champions League, Europa League, FA Cup and League Cup success in little more than three years. Yet he goes relatively unnoticed while the likes of John Terry, or his old Chelsea team-mate Frank Lampard, both with similar achievements to their name, would be stopped in their tracks.

‘If you’d said to me four or five years ago I would be in this position I’d have snapped your hands off,’ says Cahill, 29. ‘It’s an amazing feeling. I often think about how lucky I am and how so many people would love to be in this position.’

Since arriving at Stamford Bridge from Bolton in January 2012, the medals and trophies have simply kept on coming.

‘Moving to Chelsea has been such a success in terms of the titles I have won in three years,’ he says. ‘The winning mentality of the club rubs off on the players and you just want to win even more.’

A week ago, Cahill added a Capital One Cup winner’s medal as Chelsea clinched the first major silverware of season in a 2-0 victory over Tottenham at Wembley.

‘It was almost like the lads were bouncing into training the following day,’ he recalls. ‘Winning anything is special to [Jose] Mourinho. It’s his first trophy since he returned.

‘There was very little celebration considering we had just won a competition. My family had come down from the north to watch the game and they all stayed at my house. There’s no better feeling than driving home from Wembley to my family at home.’

But with the Champions League and Barclays Premier League high on Chelsea’s agenda, it is ‘back to business’ as Cahill says. Mourinho keeps stoking up the warrior-like instincts in his team and Cahill believes that, aside from the manager’s meticulous pre-match planning, two key elements are contributing to the team’s success this season.

‘We’ve learned from our experiences,’ he says. ‘We played several teams last season where people expected us to get results but we didn’t. Having that in the back of your mind going into the season has helped, you don’t want to go through that again — you don’t want to waste opportunities.’

The second key factor is the quality of signings who joined the club in the past two transfer windows — including Cesc Fabregas and one of the best strikers in Europe, Diego Costa.

‘Diego has come in and although he hardly speaks any English, had never played in this league before and has never lived in this country, he had an impact from the word go.

‘Time and again players come over and take a long time to settle down and get into the groove of the Premier League but it hasn’t fazed him. He’s one of the liveliest jokers in the changing room. He’s certainly entertaining and he has settled into the group really well.

‘With Cesc, everyone knew his quality and he has played in this League before so in a way it was easy for him to come back. But still, he has come into the side like he has never been away and the connection Costa and Fabregas have had this season has been fantastic for us.

‘There’s also the likes of Filipe Luis, who has come in and done tremendously well. There’s a real fight on at left-back. It’s one of those positions where we’re blessed. You know whoever plays is going to do the job.

‘Kurt Zouma is another great talent, he listens to everybody and he takes on advice. He’s a nice lad and a fantastic player. Playing at a club like Chelsea and being given the opportunity to play with the world-class players that we have means you can learn from them and improve your game.’

Cahill had to take some flak after Tottenham’s Harry Kane inspired a 5-3 win over Chelsea on New Year’s Day, but he takes such criticism as ‘part and parcel of the game,’ and points out that ‘there isn’t a footballer on the planet who hasn’t received negative press’ at some stage in their career.

‘You need to have a thick skin at times, especially at the highest level. I am constantly analysing my performances and I tend to focus more on things I haven’t done as well as I’d have liked. I always look to improve and that’s what’s got me to where I am today.’

Cahill’s greatest day in Chelsea colours came in the Champions League victory over Bayern Munich in 2012. Now he is playing his part in their bid to repeat the feat, and his magnificently timed flick, from a Terry cross, led to Branislav Ivanovic’s header putting Chelsea in front against Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes in the first leg of their last 16 tie last month.

‘It was a crazy situation because we found all three of us in the box and nobody else,’ recalls Cahill. ‘JT played it to me and I knew Ivanovic was coming in behind me. I couldn’t score from that angle so I tried to help it on and he did the rest.’

On Wednesday, Chelsea host PSG in the return leg, with the tie 1-1, and it’s a mouthwatering challenge.

‘It’s got that final-feel about it because if you lose the game you’re out — and you have to really push hard to win the game. The atmosphere on European nights is something special and that’s another positive with the second leg being played at home, the fans are our 12th man. Have we got the squad and the players to win it again? Yes we have.’
