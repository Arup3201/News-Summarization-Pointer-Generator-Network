A woman was left without her evening snack when a daring seagull took a fancy to her doughnut - and grabbed it from her bag.

Jennie Dack was strolling along the seafront in Brighton, East Sussex, when the pesky bird swooped in and nabbed the warm doughnut that she had bought from a nearby pier.

The unsuspecting Mrs Dack was taken completely by surprise while she enjoyed the sunshine with her husband.

Snatched! The daring bird swoops in, grabbing a half-eaten doughnut from the paper bag. Jennie Dack was taken by surprise as she enjoyed a stroll along the seafront in Brighton, East Sussex

Getaway: Sugary snack safely in its beak, the enormous bird flaps away from the scene of the theft. Mrs Dack's husband Simon, a photographer, was on hand to capture the pesky bird's daring deed on camera

Shocked: Mrs Dack shrieks as she realises what has happened. She said that she felt a hot rush of air over her shoulder and then saw the seagull - who had its sights on her snack. She said that she 'loves' Herring Gulls

She shrieked when she realised what had happened - and watched helplessly as the bird flew away with her half-eaten snack.

Mrs Dack said: 'I was walking with some hot doughnuts when I felt a rush of air over my shoulder.

'The cheeky thing swooped down and took my doughnut.

'But I won’t hold anything against the cheeky thief - I love Herring Gulls.'

Her husband, photographer Simon Dack, was on hand to capture the hilarious moment.

He said that while some people might see seagulls as a pest, his wife has always had a soft spot for the birds.

Mr Dack, from Brighton, said: 'She really does like her seagulls but one day I’m sure she’ll regret it.

'She did let out a screech as this thing swooped down, and if there’s one thing Mrs Dack doesn’t like it’s having her doughnuts pinched.'

Mission accomplished: The seagull looks unfazed as it flies away with its prize. Mrs Dack is left watching helplessly, her remaining doughnuts clutched in her hand
