A federal judge in Connecticut has clamped down on a death row inmate’s complaints that the food he is being served in prison is not kosher.

Steven Hayes, who is awaiting execution for the brutal rape, torture and murder of the Petit family, sued the Department of Correction in August, alleging the preparation practices for kosher meals in the kitchen at the state's highest-security prison do not conform to Jewish dietary laws.

Hayes describes himself in the lawsuit as an Orthodox Jew and says he's been requesting a kosher diet since May 2013.

Denied: A federal judge in Connecticut has rejected a complaint by death row inmate Steven Hayes, who sued the Corrections Department claiming prison food was not kosher

He says he has suffered ‘almost two years of emotional injury from having to choose between following God and starving or choosing sin to survive.’

Hayes and Joshua Komisarjevsky were sentenced to die for the 2007 murders of Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her daughters, 17-year-old Hayley and 11-year-old Michaela, at the family's home in Cheshire.

The victims were tied up, two of them were sexually assaulted and their bodies were found after the home was set on fire. Hawke-Petit's husband, Dr. William Petit, was severely beaten, but survived.

U.S. District Court Judge Alvin Thompson, in a ruling dated Tuesday, rejected Hayes' motions for a hearing and a temporary injunction.

The judge noted that Hayes is offered kosher meals, and the state Department of Correction has two rabbis who periodically monitor the preparation of kosher foods in the prison system.

The judge said both rabbis certified that the food and the food preparation process comply with dietary laws.

‘Although (Hayes) raises as an issue the lack of a reliable orthodox certificate or an onsite Jewish overseer, he provides no evidence suggesting that their absence leads to a finding that the meals are not kosher,’ the judge wrote.

Thompson did not throw out the lawsuit. But in rejecting the motions, he found there is not a likelihood that it will succeed.

In a handwritten amended complaint made public earlier this month, Hayes said he hasn't eaten any non-kosher food since August 24, and now weighs less than 120lbs.

State prison documents show the 5-foot-7 Hayes weighed 170lbs at the time of his arrest in 2007.

The department offers kosher food, but Hayes contends it isn't kosher because of cross-contamination.

Karen Martucci, a spokeswoman for the Correction Department, said this month that Hayes has denied to prison officials that he is on a hunger strike.

Hayes also alleges he has been the subject of other religious discrimination in prison and was placed on a suicide watch for observing a fast during the Yom Kippur holiday last year.

This is not his first lawsuit against the department. In past litigation, none of which have been successful, Hayes has complained about his mental health care, harassment from prison staff and the temperature in his cell. 

In March, Hayes was found in a stable condition in his cell after speaking many times of wanting to die because of his guilt over his horrifying crime.

In 2007, Petit and his family were held hostage for hours at their Cheshire, Connecticut home before it was set alight by invaders Steven Hayes and Joshua Komisarjevsky.

Shocking: Hayes raped and strangled Jennifer Hawke-Petit. Her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, died of smoke inhalation after they were doused with gasoline and the house was set on fire

Dr Petit was severely beaten and dumped in the basement as his daughters Michaela, 11, Hayley, 17, were tied to their beds.

After the 11-year-old was raped and her mother raped and strangled to death, the intruders set the home ablaze and left all but Petit dead.

Hayes tried to commit suicide during his 2010 trial and upon hearing he would face the death penalty, told a New Haven court 'Death, to me, will be a welcome relief.' 

The pair spotted Hawke-Petit at a supermarket and followed her to her home in Cheshire, Connecticut, where they tied up the family.

Hayes raped and strangled Hawke-Petit and Komisarjevsky sexually assaulted Michaela. Both Michaela and her sister, Hayley, were tied to their beds and died of smoke inhalation after the men doused the home with gas and set it on fire.

Connecticut repealed the death penalty in 2012, but the does law not apply to those who had already been sentenced to death.

In testimony at the trial, Hayes said he had frequently attempted suicide, slashing his wrists, slamming his mother's car into a rock and tying a sock around his neck.

He also told The Hartford Courant in a 2012 interview that he concocted a plan to end his own life by obtaining oysters, to which he is deathly allergic.

He said he fabricated claims in letters that he killed 17 people in hopes that prison authorities would notify police and he could then trade information for food, including oysters.

Joshua Komisarjevsky also was convicted and sentenced to death for the home invasion killings.
