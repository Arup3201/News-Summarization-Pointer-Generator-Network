Ryan Giggs made his first television appearance since becoming Louis van Gaal's No 2 at Manchester United, but it wasn't quite the unveiling you might have have imagined.

The 40-year-old has certainly been busy since ending the season as United's interim boss and even interrupted his holiday in Dubai to link up with Diego Maradona for a new football show.   

Giggs even hit the stage in full kit and boots as he joined Maradona and Michel Salgado on The Victorious, which aims to find the next football star in the UAE.

Speaking in a rather awkward interview after the show, Giggs said: 'I'm here in Dubai on holiday but also to work on The Victorious programme.

'It's great to see the young players doing so well and being given a chance.

'I've really enjoyed it, it's been a really successful night.'

He tweeted a snap of the famous faces along with the message: 'With Diego, Ryan Giggs, Jehad and my friend Bakoor in The Victorious'

The United veteran recently revealed his decision to retire from football after 963 games for the club, during which time he won 13 Premier league titles, four FA Cups, three League Cups and the Champions League twice.

Giggs will now be assistant to new United boss Van Gaal next season.
