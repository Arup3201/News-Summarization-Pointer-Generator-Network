Pizza Hut Singapore has been forced to apologise after a customer found a note scrawled on her receipt referring to her as the 'pink fat lady'.

The customer, Aili Si, posted a photo of the receipt on the company's Facebook page on Sunday after buying two takeaway pizzas from the Bukit Merah store in Singapore's CBD.

'I don't think it is nice for your staff to describe me as such on my receipt,' she wrote alongside the photo.

'As a customer I definitely hope to be treated with basic respect deserved by any others. I hope to receive an apology from the staff and Pizza Hut.'

The  handwritten note on the receipt was presumably to identify Aili Si as she waited for her order.

'Just feel insulted. What's wrong being plus size? I'm a customer n I pay for my pizza! Not that I'm get it for free!' she added in a later post.
