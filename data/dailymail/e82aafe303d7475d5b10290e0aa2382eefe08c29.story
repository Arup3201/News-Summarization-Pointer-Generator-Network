Alex Younger  has been appointed as successor to Sir John Sawers as Britain's top spy

The former secret service chief in Afghanistan Alex Younger has become Britain's top spy after being appointed the new head of MI6.

Mr Younger has taken over Sir John Sawers as 'C' of the Secret Intelligence Service - otherwise known as MI6. 

The former army officer, who has for last two years been overseeing MI6's global spy network, will take on the role made famous in Ian Fleming's James Bond as 'M' - most recently played by Judi Dench in Skyfall.

Mr Younger, who is married with children, has had overseas postings in Europe and the Middle East and was the senior MI6 officer in Afghanistan.

He has also filled a range of operational roles in London, including leading the Service's work on counter terrorism in the three years running up to the Olympic Games.

Outside of SIS, the economics graduate is said to enjoy music, sailing and mountaineering.

Mr Younger's appointment comes after a turbulent period for Britain's intelligence services following disclosures made by fugitive former US National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.

Mr Snowden's revelations triggered an unprecedented hearing of the Intelligence and Security Committee, in which the heads of MI6, the Security Service MI5 and listening post GCHQ appeared together in public for the first time.

Mr Snowden supporters believe the release of top-secret documents exposed an abuse of powers among the security and intelligence services in the UK and US.

But the secret services said the revelations made life easier for terrorists.

Mr Younger said: ‘I am delighted and honoured to become chief of SIS and lead one of the best intelligence agencies in the world.

‘Our dedicated staff work tirelessly against an array of threats that this country faces. They do so in close partnership with both MI5 and GCHQ with whom I am looking forward to co-operating closely.

‘I would like to pay tribute to John Sawers for his lifetime's dedication to the country and particularly to his time as C.

‘He brought us into a new era, and I am determined to build on this and bring my ideas for a modern service to life.’

Sir John said: ‘I'm delighted that my colleague and friend is taking over from me.

‘He has played a vital part alongside me in modernising SIS and ensuring that the Service is in the best possible shape to play our part in defending the country's security and our values.’

Mr Younger has been an intelligence officer since the end of the Cold War in 1991, after studying economics and serving as a British army officer.
