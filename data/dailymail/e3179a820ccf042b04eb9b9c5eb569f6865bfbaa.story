Well-wishers from around the globe screamed with excitement as news of the birth of the royal baby spread to Buckingham Palace.

One man shouted: 'It's a boy,' prompting crowds to erupt into spontaneous cheering, ahead of the easel being placed in the forecourt.

There were three cheers of 'hip hip hooray,' as the crowd outside the palace gates swelled to more than 10 deep.

Euphoric fans sang happy birthday, welcoming the new Prince into the world.

Many had been waiting patiently for confirmation of the birth ever since news of the Duchess going into labour this morning.

The months of speculation and 
anticipation - dubbed the Great Kate Wait - built to a climax this 
morning amid news that the Duchess of Cambridge had been admitted to 
hospital in the early stages of labour.

The couple’s son weighed 8lb 6oz and was
delivered at 4.24pm today at the private Lindo Wing of St Mary’s 
Hospital in Paddington with his proud father, Prince William, looking 
on.

Her Royal Highness and her child are both doing well and will remain in hospital overnight, said a spokesman for the palace. Palace sources said the couple chose to delay the public announcement of the birth to allow them to spend 'quality time' together.

It had been planned that the birth would be announced on an easel placed outside the gates of Buckingham palace but, in the event, the press were informed by a statement from the Royal household sent out at 8.30pm GMT.

The Queen, The Duke of Edinburgh, The Prince of Wales, The Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Harry and members of both families have been informed and are delighted with the news.

The long-awaited baby will be given 
the title His Royal Highness and be known as Prince of Cambridge, after 
the Queen moved earlier this year to change almost a century of royal 
tradition.

She issued a 
formal proclamation in January to end a convention brought in by George V
which meant that a royal title was restricted to the children of the 
sovereign and the children of the sovereign’s sons.

The
new baby is third in the line of succession, relegating his proud 
uncle, Prince Harry to fourth, and great-uncle, Prince Andrew, to sixth –
although he may not become sovereign for half a century or more.

Soon after
the palace announcement was made, a notice giving details about the 
baby - the third-in-line to the throne - left St Mary's Hospital in 
London by car for Buckingham Palace.

The
announcement read: 'Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge was 
safely delivered of a son at 4.24pm today. Her Royal Highness and her 
child are both doing well.'

It has been signed by the Queen's former gynaecologist Marcus Setchell, who led the medical team that delivered Kate's baby.

A smiling David Cameron declared the birth 'an important moment in the life of our nation'.

Speaking outside 10 Downing Street, 
the Prime Minister said: 'It is wonderful news from St Mary's, 
Paddington and I am sure that right across the country, and indeed right
across the Commonwealth, people will be celebrating and wishing the 
royal couple well.

'It is 
an important moment in the life of our nation but, I suppose, above all 
it is a wonderful moment for a warm and loving couple who have got a 
brand new baby boy.

'It has
been a remarkable few years for our royal family - a royal wedding that
captured people's hearts, that extraordinary and magnificent jubilee 
and now this royal birth - all from a family that has given this nation 
so much incredible service.'

'They can know that a proud nation is celebrating with a very proud and happy couple tonight.'

Recent legislation allowing female 
heirs to automatically accede to the throne if they are first born will 
clearly not affect the Cambridge’s son, but will have a bearing on any 
of his children.

Matthew and Donna Harold, from 
Michigan in the United States, said they had been asked to stock up on 
commemorative souvenirs for friends back home during their holiday in 
London.

'The royal baby is front-page news every day back in the States at the moment, there is a lot of excitement,' said Mrs Harold.

'Our holiday was booked months ago, 
so we did not expect to be over here while the baby was happening, so we
have been told to bring back as many newspapers and souvenirs with the 
baby on as possible.'

In Australia, a set of commemorative baby stamps has already been commissioned to mark the royal birth.

Lynette Traynor, a postal worker from
Melbourne who is on holiday in London, said: 'We love everything to do 
with the royals, so the news is full of it.

'We have a set of baby stamps ready to go, as soon as it has been confirmed. We can't get enough of it.'

Another visitor to the Palace, 
26-year-old German Veronika Schwarz, said she thought there was greater 
excitement outside of England.

'We don't have anything like the Royal Family in Germany, so we are all getting quite carried away with this.'

A handful of royal fans have spent 
days camped outside the Lindo Wing of St Mary's hospital, eager to 
snatch a glimpse of the baby and future sovereign.

Glaswegian couple Douglas Johnstone 
and Victoria Wallace said they felt fortunate that their trip to London 
coincided with the royal birth.

Mr Johnstone said: 'We are very lucky to have planned our trip at this time.'

Police chatted with visitors, many pondering potential names for the newborn future monarch.
