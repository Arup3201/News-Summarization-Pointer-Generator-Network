It is supposedly how the Duchess of Cambridge and Pippa Middleton slimmed down for the wedding of the century and counts A listers including Jennifer Lopez, supermodel Gisele Bundchen, and Welsh singer Katherine Jenkins amongst its past followers.

But now the Dukan diet, brain child of Pierre Dukan and no stranger to criticism, has again been condemned by doctors.

The high protein, low carb regime has come under fire by the British Dietetic Association (BDA) who warn that the diet is not nutritionally balanced and may increase risk of long term health problems.

The Duchess of Cambridge, who personified slim elegance on her wedding, was rumoured to have used the Dukan diet in the run up to the big day

Carole Middleton's confession that the Dukan diet was responsible for her trim figure at the royal wedding sparked rumours that her daughter Pippa (right) may also have followed the regime

On the NHS website, the BDA says of the diet: 'Rapid weight loss can be motivating but it is unsustainable and unhealthy. The Dukan diet isn't nutritionally balanced, which is acknowledged by the fact that you need a vitamin supplement and a fibre top-up in the form of oat bran.

'There's a danger this type of diet could increase your risk of long-term health problems if you don't stick to the rules. The diet lacks variety in the initial phases so there's a risk you'll get bored quickly and give up.'

While they acknowledge that the lack of calorie counting and initial weightless may be appealing to many, they warn that the negative side effects are highly unpleasant.

'At the start of the diet you may experience side effects such as bad breath, a dry mouth, tiredness, dizziness, insomnia and nausea from cutting out carbs.

Both Gisele Bundchen and Jennifer Lopez have reportedly used the Dukan diet in the past to maintain their perfect physiques

'The lack of wholegrains, fruit and veg in the early stages of the diet could cause problems such as constipation,' the NHS website states.

Dukan is a complicated four-phase diet that starts with a protein-only approach which promotes weight loss of around 7lb per week.

The first phase, which lasts for five days, is highly restrictive, allowing you to eat only from a list of 72 low-fat high-protein foods such as chicken, fish and eggs, and bans all carbohydrates except a few handfuls of oat bran.

In this phase it also highly restricts fats and bans vegetables, unlike other high protein diets like Atkins.

Dr Pierre Dukan is a controversial figure and his diet has come under fire from experts numerous times over the years

Although most foods are slowly re-introduced over the following three phases, the diet still advises having a protein-only day every week to maintain weight loss.

This is not the first time the diet has been slated. In 2011 Experts from the British Dietetic Association named the Dukan Diet the worst celebrity weight loss plan to follow and said it has 'absolutely no solid science behind it at all'.

The popularity of Dr Dukan's high-protein diet soared after Carole Middleton, (it and it was speculated her two daughters) revealed she had been following it.

The following year in 2012 diet guru Pierre Dukan, faced being struck off as a doctor in France for giving 'dangerous' food advice to teenagers.

The celebrity nutritionist was accused of breaching medical ethics for saying slimmer pupils should be awarded higher exam marks than their fatter friends.

Dr Dukan said that pupils should be able to opt for an extra exam subject called 'ideal weight', which they could pass simply by being thin enough.

In July last year Dr Dukan struck himself off the medical register voluntarily, just before he was banned by France's medical board from practising medicine and prescribing medicines. The 71-year-old Frenchman, is said to have lied to his patients about the Mediator pill, which has been linked to hundreds of deaths.

Sitting in Paris, the medical board ruled that Dukan was guilty of a 'breach of ethical regulations' for prescribing Mediator on five separate occasions, and then lying about what he did.

Dukan was also ordered to pay the equivalent of Â£5,200 in damages to a former patient who suffered heart difficulties in the 1970s after being told to take Mediator, even though it was only intended to treat diabetes.

Presenter Phillip Schofield is one of any celebrities who have praised the 5:2 diet for their weight loss

The 5:2 diet, which sees followers fasting for two days a week to lose weigh, has been nothing short of a phenomenon over the past year with stars to politicians jumping on the band wagon.

The idea that most of the time you don't have to restrict your intake but can still lose weight is highly seductive, and success stories abound about the eating plan.

However the BDA warns that real scientific evidence of the diet's success is limited - particularly in the long term - and that the fasting days may result in dire health consequences.

'Skipping meals could make you feel dizzy, irritable, give you headaches and make it hard to concentrate, which can affect work and other daily tasks. Other reported side effects are difficulties sleeping and daytime sleepiness, bad breath and dehydration,' the website states.

It also warns that people shouldn't view non fasting days as a chance to gorge as this will not only reduce the diet's effectiveness, but can be bad for your health.

Their overall verdict is: 'The 5:2 is a simple way to reduce calorie intake. There are lots of versions of this diet, with some less safe than others. Many studies on intermittent fasting are short-term, involve small numbers of subjects, or are animal-based. 

Those on intermittent fasting diets like the 5:2 must avoid gorging and over indulging on non fasting days

'If you choose to follow it, choose an evidence-based plan based on healthy, balanced eating and written by a dietitian like the "2-Day Diet".

'It's vital for your health to avoid nutritional deficiencies, dehydration and overeating on non-fast days. Never attempt to delay or skip meals if you are pregnant, have had, or are prone to, eating disorders or diabetes.'

Jennifer Aniston is one of those rumoured to have followed the Alkaline diet in the past

This diet is based on the theory that modern diets create too much acid in our bodies which is turned to fat, as well as causing many common medical complaints like arthritis and tiredness.

Despite many ultra slim celebrities such as Jennifer Aniston and Victoria Beckham having reportedly sworn by the Alkaline diet at one time or another, the diet has no scientific basis.

The BDA says: 'The theory of the alkaline diet is that eating certain foods can help maintain the body's ideal pH balance (acidity levels) to improve overall health. But the body maintains its pH balance regardless of diet. The diet lacks evidence.'

Although if you chose to follow a loser version of the diet there can be positives - such as avoiding processed foods, alcohol and sugar - which would also be advisable on any weight loss regime.

More stringent versions of the diet suggest cutting right back on or even eliminating 'acid producing foodsâ€™ which include dairy.

Dairy foods provide essential calcium so the BDA warns: 'When cutting down on dairy products such as milk, cheese and yoghurt you need to find other calcium substitutes, as cutting out an entire food group is never a good idea. 

'The versions that advise cutting out entire food groups should be avoided.'

The NHS website shares the BDA's verdict of many popular diets commonly followed, and the results make for bleak reading.

From lack of evidence of the diets' effectiveness to health risks, there seems to be something wrong with nearly every diet.

But luckily the NHS and BDA have provided those looking to shed pounds with a diet that they DO endorse.

Intended for adults with a BMI of 25 or over (classified as overweight), the 12 week plan aims to help you lose weight at a safe and sustainable rate of 1lb- 2lbs a week.

They advise that for most men this will mean consuming no more than 1,900kcals a day, and for most women, no more than 1,400kcals daily.

The plan gives tips and advice, as well as meal and exercise plans, but does not cut out any major food groups.

The diet advises how to spread your calorie allowance across the day to avoid hunger, but the suggestions can be altered according to your schedule.

It also gives tips such as eating slowly and away from distractions such as television, as well as eating from smaller plates to make portions seem bigger.
