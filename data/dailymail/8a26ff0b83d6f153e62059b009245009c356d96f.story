An alleged blackmailer who tried to extort $5,000 from a university professor with an online sex scam involving his underage daughter pleaded not guilty on Tuesday.

The 37-year-old, from 
Louisiana, was arraigned in Houston federal court on a charge of using a phone and the Internet 
to extort money from Texas A&M University professor James Arnt Aune,
59.

Mr Aune, a married father-of-two autistic children, jumped to his 
death from a campus parking garage on January 8.

He had been lured into sharing 
sexually explicit pictures with an underage girl online and then 
blackmailed by her father who orchestrated the elaborate scam,
police said.

The suspect was ordered to remain in jail without bail and his trial is scheduled for May 28.

If convicted, he faces up to two 
years in jail. His court-appointed attorney Marjorie Meyers declined 
to comment about the case.

Authorities allege that Aune was one of 
many victims of a scheme in which the man used his daughter to lure men 
into sexually explicit online relationships and later blackmailed them.

The man has not been named to protect the identity of his daughter.

Prosecutors allege that the man's daughter told authorities in 
Louisiana in 2011 that her father took naked photos and videos of her 
and used them 'to scam men' through MocoSpace, a social networking 
website mainly for mobile devices.

On
the site, 'she would meet men, get their phone numbers and send them 
pictures and videos then (her father) would call them and say how she 
was his daughter and how she would need counseling and they had to pay 
for it'.

At the time of 
that 2011 interview, her father was facing two counts of oral sexual 
battery and two counts of aggravated incest.

The charges were dropped in
February 2012 due to a lack of corroborating evidence, said Rachael 
Domiano, a spokeswoman for the 21st Judicial District Attorney's Office 
in Louisiana.

Federal 
prosecutors on Tuesday declined to comment about certain details of the 
alleged scheme, and it wasn't clear from the criminal complaint if 
prosecutors believe the defendant's daughter actually interacted with 
Aune, or if her image was used to allegedly dupe him.

Mr Aune was regarded as a fine scholar, mentor and friend by students and fellow professors, where he headed the school's Department of Communication.

However he had battled depression in recent years. He struggled with the administrative duties of being a department head, and he was badly shaken by his 2007 battle with prostate cancer, which he survived but which forced him to face his own mortality, his widow said.

'He never really came all the way back,' Miriam Aune said of his surviving cancer.

He began drinking heavily, and in December he started a sexually explicit online relationship with what he thought was an underage girl, according to prosecutors.

He was soon contacted by a man purporting to be her outraged father, who threatened to expose Aune unless he paid him $5,000.

Aune paid the man $1,500, but he didn't know if he could come up with the rest, authorities say. He confessed to his wife, who pledged to stand by him, but about a week later, the 59-year-old Aune jumped to his death after sending a final text: 'Killing myself now. And u will be prosecuted for black mail.'

Mrs Aune, 56, said investigators told her that the defendant was the person who communicated with her husband and other men, pretending to be his daughter.

She said her husband told her he began the online chats sometime in December and that by the third or fourth day after the chats began, the defendant reached out to him asking for money.

According to court records, undated texts show Aune scrambling to put money on prepaid credit cards for the defendant and asking for his forgiveness, saying: 'I am very sorry. It was a weak moment.'

A week before his suicide, James Aune confessed to his wife. Miriam Aune said her husband never told her why he did it.

She pledged her support for him, but said he became despondent after his confession.

'I was just telling him there was nothing that we couldn't get through. We have two autistic children we have raised to adulthood. We've been through rough stuff. I thought we could get through this,' Miriam Aune said.

According to a criminal complaint, 
the defendant continued bombarding Aune with profanity laced emails, 
texts and voicemails, including a January 7 email in which he warned 
Aune that he had until noon the next day to pay or else 'the police, 
your place of employment, students, ALL OVER THE INTERNET ...ALL OF THEM
will be able to see your conversations, texts, pictures you sent ....'

On
January 8 at 9.21am, the defendant texted: '3 more hours. If i don't 
hear from you the calls start,' according the criminal complaint by FBI 
agent Nikki Allen.

At 10.29 am, Aune replied: 'Killing myself now And u will be prosecuted for blackmail.'

He
jumped from the parking garage roof about a minute later, shocking the 
A&M campus, which is about 100 miles northwest of Houston.

Miriam Aune doesn't excuse her husband's actions. She said it was his decision to go online and begin the conversations.

'It
just shows you anybody can slip off the path. I know a lot of people 
are very surprised by this. He was very human with flaws, just like all 
of us,' she said.

But she said it saddens her to know that some people will only remember her husband for what happened at the end of his life.

'To him, being a professor, it was a sacred duty to him. And he cared so much about his students,' she said as she cried.

'The people who know him, who loved him, they are not going to feel any differently about him.'
