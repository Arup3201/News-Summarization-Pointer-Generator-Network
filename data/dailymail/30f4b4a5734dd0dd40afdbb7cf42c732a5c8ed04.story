Many of today's acting heavyweights launched their careers as child stars - but little Elvis O'Connor's star quality was spotted before he was even born.

The now 11-month old was snapped up by an acting agency after talent spotters were shown a scan of him in his mother's womb.

Now Elvis has had his first taste of life in the spotlight after appearing in the ITV drama Mrs Biggs, playing the child of the infamous great train robber Ronnie Biggs.

Early potential: This 3D scan of Elvis O'Connor in the womb was all it took for a talent agency to snap him up

Elvis' parents Andy, 34, and Shelley, 35, from Oldham, Manchester, sent a 3D scan of their son to Scream Management Agency while Shelley, an air hostess was still expecting him.

Clearly impressed with what they saw, talent spotters at the agency immediately put Elvis on their books.

The baby boy is following in the footsteps of his big sister Alana, 5, who is also on the books at the casting agency.

Mr O'Connor said: 'Elvis' sister Alana is already with the casting agency and when we found out we were expecting Elvis we sent them over a scan.

'They said they could tell he was going to look like his sister and that they would like to put him on their books.

'He was pretty much cast for Mrs Biggs before he was even born,' he added.

Baby Elvis was just six months old when he filmed the scenes for Mrs Biggs, which stars actress Sheridan Smith in the title role.

And it seems that - despite still being in nappies - Elvis is already the consummate professional on set.

'Everyone loved him on set and he was really well behaved,' said Mr O'Connor, a construction worker.

Big sister Alana has already had several acting roles.

Jess Bell, of Scream Management, said: 'Both Elvis and Alana are very talented.'

ITV's Mrs Biggs tells the story of the notorious train robber from the perspective of his wife, Charmian.

The five-part drama chronicles the life of Charmian - played by Gavin and Stacey actress Sheridan Smith - from her first meeting with Ronnie as a teenager, to the devastating consequences of the Great Train Robbery in 1963.
