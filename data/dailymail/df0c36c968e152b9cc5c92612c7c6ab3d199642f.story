Manchester United target Edinson Cavani appears to have been erased from Paris Saint-Germain's latest advertisement for their new away kit, fuelling speculation he could leave.

Cavani was included in PSG's poster for their new home kit but has been left out of the corresponding image for their second strip.

The likes 
of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, David Luiz and Thiago Silva all appear in both 
advertisements, while the Uruguay forward is the only one left out of the almost identical away strip 
poster.

Now you see him, now you don't: Edinson Cavani has not been included in PSG's latest kit poster

Mega signing: PSG forked out an incredible £55m on Cavani back in July 2013

Cavani is said to be pinning his hopes on landing a move to the Premier League as he has become disillusioned with life at Parc des Princes.

The 27-year-old has had to play the majority of his football at PSG on the wing in order to accommodate team-mate Ibrahimovic - although he did miss a glorious chance against Chelsea in the Champions League quarter-final against Chelsea playing up front.

United were linked with a whopping £56million move for Cavani, however Louis van Gaal has decided to assess his options before making any further signings this summer.
