The astrologer who guided Ronald Reagan through every major decision of his presidency has died at the age of 87.

Joan Quigley was consulted on everything from the Soviet Union to Air Force One's flight schedules.

Before any crucial decision, the president was known to mutter: 'What does Joan say?'

She was, White House sources claim, the administration's 'best kept secret'.

Influence: Joan Quigley, who has died at the age of 87, advised President Reagan on key decisions

'What does Joan say?' The president was known to utter those words during all crucial discussions

Quigley took up the extraordinary role in 1981 after Nancy Reagan contacted her following John Hinckley's assassination attempt on her husband.

They had met in 1970 on the Merv Griffin Show where Quigley, a socialite from Kansas City, was a regular guest, alongside writing magazine columns under the pseudonym Angel Star.

Evidently impressed, the First Lady put her on a $3,000-a-month retainer and installed her own private lines at the White House and Camp David.

'Sometimes I would talk with Nancy for three hours a day,' Quigley said in 1995.

It was a position Quigley - an avid Republican - had fantasized about for years after reading President Reagan's stars.

'He had the most brilliant horoscope I'd ever seen in this country in this century,' she told The Washington Post in 1988.

Soon she was quietly influencing pivotal decisions, with direct lines installed at the White House and Camp David.

She told Reagan to stop seeing the Soviet Union as 'evil' - supposedly a gem of advice that inspired the president to soften his stance on the region.

'At the time, they were thinking of the Russians as gangsters,' Quigley said. 

'I told Nancy that Gorbachev was a different kind of leader, and that he would share a vision with Reagan.' 

Quigley's secret position lasted until she was outed in 1988 by former chief of staff Donald Reagan.

As the world reeled in shock, Quigley insisted that she was a 'serious, scientific astrologer.'

Dazzling career: She was a regular on the Merv Griffin Show and wrote horoscope columns for magazines

Fateful meeting: She was introduced to the First Lady by Merv Griffin and evidently impressed her

'I am really not one of these clowns, and I really don't like this circus atmosphere,' she told the Associated Press in 1988.

In the years that followed, the former First Couple downplayed Quigley's role.

Nancy Reagan wrote in her memoir that she was in touch with Quigley but the president was more reticent. 

The president became aware of the consultations, she said, and warned his wife to be careful because it might look odd if it came out.

'If it makes you feel better, go ahead and do it,' she quoted the president as saying. 

Close: Quigley said she and Nancy Reagan (left) would speak on the phone up to three times a day. She was outed in 1988 (pictured right) by a former chief of staff and became a worldwide sensation 

Quigley died on October 21 at her San Francisco home after an unspecified illness, the San Francisco Chronicle said on Friday.

'Joan was many many things,' her sister Ruth Quigley told SF Gate on Thursday. 

'She was a truly interesting, complex, and remarkable person. And she was a beautiful woman as well.

'Astrology was a very important part of her life, but she also wrote books. She was an art history major in college, and remained extremely knowledgeable about art. She led a remarkable life.'
