'Prisoner of conscience': Saudi blogger Raif Badawi, who is facing ten years jail, a thousand lashes and a million riyal fine (£133,000) for 'insulting Islam'

A Saudi blogger is facing ten years jail, a thousand lashes and a million riyal fine for 'insulting Islam'.

Raif
 Badawi originally faced seven years jail and 600 lashes, but an appeal 
court overturned that sentence and ordered a retrial.

Amnesty
 International has called the new sentence 'outrageous' and says Badawi 
is a 'prisoner of conscience'. His website has been closed since his 
first trial.

Badawi
 was arrested in June 2012 and charged with cyber crime and disobeying 
his father - a crime in Saudi Arabia - in relation to his Saudi Liberal 
Network website..

The site 
included articles that were critical of senior religious figures such as
 Saudi Arabia's Grand Mufti, according to Human Rights Watch.

The prosecution had demanded that 
Badawi be tried for apostasy, a crime which carries the death penalty in
 Saudi Arabia, but his original trial judge dismissed that charge.

Badawi's
 lawyers have slammed yesterday's sentence as too harsh, althought the 
prosecutor had asked for a harsher penalty, according to news website 
Sabq.

The ruling is subject
 to appeal but, after his last appeal led to a stiffer penalty, and with
 his original lawyer, human rights activist Waleed Abu al-Khair, 
currently held in Riyadh's Malaz Prison on charges including 'breaking 
allegiance with the king', Badawi may think twice about challenging the 
latest ruling.

Khair was detained incommunicado in April after appearing in court in Riyadh on sedition charges, according to his wife.

Philip
 Luther, director of the Middle East and North Africa programme at 
Amnesty International, urged Saudi authorities to quash Badawi's 
conviction.

'The decision to sentence Raif Badawi to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes is outrageous,' he said.

'He is a prisoner of conscience who is
 guilty of nothing more than daring to create a public forum for 
discussion and peacefully exercising the right to freedom of expression.

'The authorities must overturn his conviction and release him immediately and unconditionally.

'Raif Badawi is the latest victim to fall prey to the ruthless campaign to silence peaceful activists in Saudi Arabia.

'The
 authorities seem determined to crush all forms of dissent through every
 means at their disposal, including imposing harsh prison sentences and 
corporal punishment on activists.'

Human
 Rights Watch says Saudi Arabia, a staunch ally of the West in the 
Middle East, has a long history of suppressing free expression.

'What
 is different with these cases is the long prison terms imposed by the 
terrorism court on activists, sometimes ranging between 10 to 15 years,'
 said Adam Coogle, the organisation's Middle East researcher.

In a separate ruling on this week, a 
court convicted the administrator of a website on charges of supporting 
Internet forums hostile to the state and which promoted demonstrations, 
Sabq reported on Wednesday. It said he was sentenced to six years in 
jail and a 50,000 riyal fine.

The
 news website said another Saudi was sentenced to five years in jail for
 publishing a column by a prominent Shi'ite Muslim cleric on his 
website.

The world's top oil exporter follows the strict Wahhabi school of Sunni Islam and applies Islamic law, sharia.

Judges base their decisions on their own interpretation of religious law rather than on a written legal code or on precedent.

Rattled by the uprisings that destabilised the Middle East in recent years, Riyadh has intensified a crackdown on domestic dissent with arrests and prosecutions.

In April, a Saudi court sentenced an unidentified activist to six years in jail on charges including taking part in illegal demonstrations and organising women's protests.

Another was sentenced to three years in jail for spreading lies against King Abdullah and inciting the public against him.'

One million riyals is equivalent to £133,000.
