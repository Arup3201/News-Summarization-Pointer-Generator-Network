Almost 70,000 problem families have had their lives turned around following a crackdown on truancy, worklessness and anti-social behaviour.

Ministers boasted that more than half of England’s troubled families are now back on track.

Dedicated key workers have been sent into the homes of a total of 120,000 families which cost the taxpayer up to £9billion in police callouts, truancy, vandalism and social work.

New figures show how almost 70,000 families have been 'turned around' by dedicated council teams

The troubled families programme was launched by David Cameron in 2011 to tackle the deep-seated problems that blight parts of the country, mainly in inner-city areas.

It was claimed that up to £8billion of the £9billion was spent reacting to the problems created and experienced by these families, and not tackling their causes.

The number of agencies dealing with problem families was cut, after research showed as many as 20 different organisations could be involved in dealing with the same family.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said: ‘The Troubled Families programme demonstrates exactly what our long-term economic plan means for people.

‘New opportunities for families to turn their lives around and make something of themselves; more economic security for local communities blighted by worklessness; and more economic stability for taxpayers, as we reduce the bills for social failure and get this country living within its means.’

The £450million scheme, launched in 2011, set a target of helping 120,000 families by 2015. 

Today the Department for Communities and Local Government said 690,000 have had their lives ‘turned around’ and councils’ dedicated teams were working with a total of 117,000 families.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said the troubled families programme had been a success at cutting truancy, youth crime and unemployment

Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander added: ‘This government has turned around the lives of thousands of troubled families, transforming prospects for younger people and creating a fairer society.

‘Unlike previous governments, we’ve brought together multiple services to finally deal with complex problems in a more effective and efficient way.

‘Given that these issues previously cost an estimated £9 billion a year, that’s great news for taxpayers too.’

By August this year, Birmingham city council had turned around 2,141 families, Liverpool 1,677, Leeds 1,604 and Manchester 1,584.

Louise Casey, head of the Troubled Families programme, said: ‘This programme is working so effectively because it deals with the whole family and all of their problems, with 1 key worker going in through the front door and getting to grips with an average of 9 different problems, rather than a series of services failing to engage or get the family to change.’
