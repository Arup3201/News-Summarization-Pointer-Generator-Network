Back by popular demand, a university brought in some irresistibly cute baby animals as part of their 'stress less' strategy in the lead up to final exams of the year.

Students of The University of Canberra, in the Australian Capital Territory, bonded with their cuddly and furry friends to help ease their pre-examination jitters.

But it's not the first time a petting zoo has paid a visit to the campus, according to the campus life coordinator Dave McCarthy.

Irresistibly cute baby animals such as this kitten was at The University of Canberra, in the Australian Capital Territory, on Thursday

'We've been holding the petting zoo on campus for three years now and the students love it,' Mr McCarthy told Daily Mail Australia.

The university's stress less week is held each semester, a week before the exam period begins.

Various activities are held throughout the week - a free brekky, barbecue and some acoustic tunes - to treat the students before they embark on a stressful few weeks of exams.

Mr McCarthy believes it's an effective strategy which has grown in popularity each year.

'It's because we know that when you hold a kitten, everything just seems okay,' he said.

'You really can't be unhappy if you're around baby animals. 

'And we love seeing the pure disbelief on the faces of students when they see a goat on campus.'

This semester the tiny kittens were a massive hit and in many cases were used as a shoulder accessory, Mr McCarthy said.

'We had lambs, puppies, chickens rabbits and guinea pigs and a pig but the most amusing part of the day was watching people trying to take selfies with the goats,' he said.

As for the cage of mice that came along for the fun - they weren't so popular among the students.

'I guess we just wanted a bit of diversity,' Mr McCarthy said.
