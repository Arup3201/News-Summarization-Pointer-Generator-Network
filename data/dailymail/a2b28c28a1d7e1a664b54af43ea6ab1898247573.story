The Supreme Court has ruled that police can collect DNA from anyone they arrest, equating a DNA cheek swab to common jailhouse procedures like take fingerprints and mug shots.

Civil liberties groups condemned Monday's decision - saying it amounts to creating a 'gaping new exception to the Fourth Amendment' by allowing authorities to collect a person's DNA and add it to national criminal databases without a warrant - no matter whether they are convicted or not.

The split 5-4 decision saw conservative Justice Antonin Scalia join three liberal colleagues, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, in opposing the ruling.

Collected: The Supreme Court ruling paves the way for allowing states to collect DNA evidence from anyone arrested by police

Should police be allowed to keep DNA collected from anyone they arrest on national database â€“ even if they are not convicted of a crime?

'Make no mistake about it: because of today's decision, your DNA can be 
taken and entered into a national database if you are ever arrested, 
rightly or wrongly, and for whatever reason,' Scalia said in a sharp dissent, which he read aloud in the 
courtroom.

'This will solve some extra crimes, to be sure. But so would 
taking your DNA when you fly on an airplane - surely the TSA must know 
the 'identity' of the flying public. For that matter, so would taking 
your children's DNA when they start public school.'

The five justices who ruled in favor of allowing routine DNA collection said it was similar to practices already allowed under the Fourth Amendment - which protects against unreasonable searches and seizure of property.

'Taking and analyzing a cheek swab of the arrestee DNA is, like fingerprinting and photographing, a legitimate police booking procedure that is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment,' Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the court's five-justice majority.

According to court documents, the FBI's Combined DNA Index System or 
CODIS - a coordinated system of federal, state and local databases of 
DNA profiles - already contains more than 10 million criminal profiles 
and 1.1 million profiles of those arrested.

Anger: Justice Antonin Scalia issued a sharp dissent to the court's majority opinion - claiming that the benefits of DNA collection for arrestees do not outweigh to violations of privacy

According to the FBI, DNA from people who have gotten the charge 
dismissed, who were acquitted or from whom no charges were brought are 
supposed to be expunged from the federal system. But states and other 
municipalities that collect DNA make their own rules about what happens 
to their collection.

The case centers around Alonzo King Jr, who was arrested in 2009 in Wicomico County, Maryland, on assault charges. When he was booked into jail - before his trial - deputies took a DNA sample with a cheek swab.

'Make no mistake about it: because of today's decision, your DNA can be taken and entered into a national database if you are ever arrested, rightly or wrongly, and for whatever reason.'

Justice Antonin Scalia, dissenting from the majority ruling

The DNA matched evidence from a brutal 2003 rape and robbery of a 53-year-old woman. That evidence was then used to convict him of the six-year-old crime. He was sentenced to life in prison.

Twenty-eight states and the federal government now take DNA swabs after arrests. But a Maryland court was one of the first to say that it was illegal for that state to take King's DNA without approval from a judge, saying King had 'a sufficiently weighty and reasonable expectation of privacy against warrantless, suspicionless searches' under the Fourth Amendment.

But the high court's decision reverses that ruling and reinstates King's rape conviction, which was overturned by the Maryland court.

Kennedy wrote the decision, and was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Stephen Breyer.

The American Civil Liberties Union represented King at trial and condemned the court's decision.

'The Fourth Amendment has long been understood to mean that the police cannot search for evidence of a crime - and all nine justices agreed that DNA testing is a search - without individualized suspicion,' said Steven R. Shapiro, the group's legal director.

'Today's decision eliminates that crucial safeguard. At the same time, it's important to recognize that other state laws on DNA testing are even broader than Maryland's and may present issues that were not resolved by today's ruling.'

Rapist: The Supreme Court decision today upheld the conviction of Alonzo King Jr., who was convicted of a six-year-old violent rape after DNA was collected from him at his arrest on unrelated charges

Maryland's DNA collection law only allows police to take DNA from those arrested for serious crimes like murder, rape, assault, burglary and other crimes of violence. In his ruling, Kennedy did not say whether the court's decision limits DNA only to those crimes, but he did note that other states' DNA collection laws differ from Maryland's.

Scalia saw that as a flaw. 'If you believe that a DNA search will identify someone arrested for bank robbery, you must believe that it will identify someone arrested for running a red light,' he said.

The ruling was praised by the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network.

'DNA has already aided nearly 200,000 investigations, and thanks to today's decision it will continue to be a detective's most valuable tool in solving rape cases,' said Scott Berkowitz, the group's president and founder.

'We're very pleased that the court recognized the importance of DNA and decided that, like fingerprints, it can be collected from arrestees without violating any privacy rights.

'Out of every 100 rapes in this country, only three rapists will spend a day behind bars. To make matters worse, rapists tend to be serial criminals, so every one left on the streets is likely to commit still more attacks. DNA is a tool we could not afford to lose.'

Getting DNA swabs from criminals is common. All 50 states and the federal government take cheek swabs from convicted criminals to check against federal and state databanks, with the court's blessing. The fight at the Supreme Court was over whether that DNA collection could come before conviction and without a judge issuing a warrant.
