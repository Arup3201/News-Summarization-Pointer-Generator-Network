Sunderland winger Charis Mavrias is wanted by Greek sides Panathinaikos and PAOK.

The 20-year-old has made just four Premier League appearances for the Black Cats since signing in 2013.

And he could make a return to his former side Panathinaikos, with the former Greek champions interested in bringing him back to the club.

Mavrias has won three caps for Greece and is renowned for his pace.

But he has struggled to establish himself in the Sunderland side and, despite playing twice for Greece this campaign, he has failed to make a single appearance for Gus Poyet's men.

Mavrias made 54 league appearances for Panathinaikos during his first spell at the club, scoring on three occasions.
