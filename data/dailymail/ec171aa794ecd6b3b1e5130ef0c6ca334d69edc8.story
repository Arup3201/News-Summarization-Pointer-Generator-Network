Residents of a street in Stoke-on-Trent are bracing themselves after a wife from hell who was given an Asbo for repeatedly shouting at her husband moved in next door.

Julie Griffiths and long suffering partner Norman caused those living near their former home not far from the city to complain to the local council.

Mrs Griffiths, 45, has been taken to court on several occasions for launching loud rants at her other half - earning her the nickname 'nagsbo'.

Julie Griffiths, who was given an Asbo for ranting at her husband, has moved into a new home

Those living near her former home in Talke, Staffordshire celebrated last month after it emerged the couple were moving out after more than a decade living in their pink terraced house.

Mrs Griffiths was originally handed a five-year Asbo in December 2012 after noise monitoring equipment was installed to measure the volume of her shouting.

But she has since been accused of breaching the order, landing her back in court.

The Sun reported this morning that residents of another street have now discovered she is moving in.

New neighbour James Clarke, 52, told the paper: 'I don't sleep too well as it is, so with them shouting all hours I'll never get a minute's peace. Why don't they get a caravan in some field? That's the best place for them.'

Their fears came after former neighbours of Mrs Griffiths were said to be 'popping champagne corks' after she left her former home.

Complaints had been made against her moaning since 1999, but it was around thirteen years before she received her Asbo.

The ruling prohibited her from creating noise audible to neighbouring properties, shouting, screaming or banging on internal doors and communicating with certain neighbours.

Earlier this year she was fined for the noise she made when berating 64-year-old Mr Griffiths for buying the wrong type of scratch card.

This was before a third court appearance where she was accused laying into her partner's hygiene.

Friends say the couple have been married for more than 20 years but Griffiths' nagging only became an issue three years ago. She hasÂ  reportedly been banned from numerous family events because of her tantrums.
