An electronic gadget that alerts insurance firms of people's driving habits could be used by hackers to control the car, it has been claimed.

Experts say the Snapshot, which Progressive Insurance has used  in more than two million vehicles since 2008, is simple to hack.

By gaining access to it hackers could theoretically affect steering or braking, a security expert has claimed. 

The SnapShot (right) simply plugs into a car's diagnostic port - but contains virtually no security measures, a leading expert has claimed.

A SnapShot user manages to work out how the gadget communicates with the car, and found that he was able to access certain functions of the car's CAN bus - a standard system which allows various computers and components inside a car to talk to each other.

The SnapShot connects to the car via this system, and by gaining access to it hackers could theoretically affect steering or braking.

Corey Thuen, who works as a security expert at consultancy firm Digital Bond, reverse engineered the software included on the SnapShot and found that he was able to access certain functions of the car's CAN bus - a standard system which allows various computers and components inside a car to talk to each other.

The SnapShot connects to the car via this system, and by gaining access to it hackers could theoretically affect steering or braking.

'The firmware running on the dongle is minimal and insecure,' he told Forbes.

'It does no validation or signing of firmware updates, no secure boot, no cellular authentication, no secure communications or encryption, no data execution prevention or attack mitigation technologies… basically it uses no security technologies whatsoever.'

Thuen said the results could be disastrous.  

'A skilled attacker could almost certainly compromise such dongles to gain remote control of a vehicle, or even an entire fleet of vehicles. 

'Once compromised, the consequences range from privacy data loss to life and limb.

Progressive hit out at the claims, and the way they were revealed - the flaw was presented last week at the S4x15 hacking conference in Miami.

'If an individual has credible evidence of a potential vulnerability related to our device, we would prefer that the person would first disclose that potential vulnerability to use so that we could evaluate it and, if necessary, correct it before the vulnerability could be exploited,' the company told Forbes.

The gadget is plugged into the car's diagnostic port - and sends information to insurance firms.

'While it's unfortunate that Mr. Thuen didn't share his findings with us privately in advance, we would welcome his confidential and detailed input so that we can properly evaluate his claims.'  

Thuen reportedly contacted the manufacturer of the SnapShot device, Xirgo Technologies, to inform it of the security vulnerability, but heard no response.

Progressive Insurance says on its website that Snapshot 'notes information like the distance, time of day and how you drive, including any hard brakes.

'Snapshot personalises your insurance rate based on your actual driving. 

'The better you drive, the more you can save.' 

David Emm, principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab, warned 'This is just another example of how, as our cars become increasingly connected, we open the door to threats that have long existed in the PC and smartphone world. 

'As well as gaining remote access to the vehicle, by compromising USB dongles cybercriminals could potentially exploit features such as self-parking, active lane control, pre-collision systems and adaptive cruise control, all of which require some level of communication between a sensor and the brakes, acceleration or steering, usually over Bluetooth or some other radio signal.

'As vehicles become increasingly connected and autonomous, we can only expect to see more attacks of this nature.'
