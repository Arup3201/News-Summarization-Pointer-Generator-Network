England stars Raheem Sterling and Ross Barkley were in relaxed form ahead of England's Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia on Saturday. 

Barcelona midfielder Xavi said during the week that the two youngsters would thrive at the Nou Camp if they were ever signed by the Catalan giants. 

The young duo seemed to be taking all the recent praise in their stride as they chilled out at England's team base with a friendly-ish game of FIFA. 

Raheem Sterling speaks to the camera, operated by Ross Barkley, after losing in FIFA to the Everton player 

Sterling is magnanimous in defeat saying: 'He used Real Madrid, but it all counts... so well done Ross.’

The pacy Liverpool forward gets a thumbs up from the Toffees midfielder who replies: 'Unlucky lad' 

Barkley, who recently signed a new five-year contract with Everton, emerged victorious with Sterling gracious in defeat. 

'Just played Ross at FIFA and he’s the best today,’ said Sterling.

‘I’ll give him that. He used Real Madrid, but it all counts at the end of the day so well done Ross.’

‘Unlucky lad,’ Barkley replied.
