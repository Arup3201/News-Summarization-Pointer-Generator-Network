On the day his mother, Mia Farrow, suggested in a Vanity Fair interview the sensational possibility that his father might be Frank Sinatra and not Woody Allen, it has been claimed that Ronan Farrow is in talks to host his own MSNBC show.

Yale Law School graduate, Farrow, 25, who is currently a Rhode Scholar at Oxford University has already made many appearances on MSNBC and CNN in the past in his capacity as the Special Adviser to the Secretary of State for Global Youth Issues.

In a clear sign that MSNBC is seeking to diversify its image in an attempt to engage with a Millennial audience, sources at the network indicate that Farrow would host a weekend progaram and join a lineup that would include former Democratic consultant Karen Finney and Salon political writer Steve Kornacki.

Farrow, is the only biological son of Mia Farrow and Woody Allen and his resume has all the hallmarks of a genius.

He
was admitted to Yale Law School at the age of 16 and has also been a 
prolific journalist and activist for child advocacy issues, especially 
in Africa.

He has 
served in the Obama administration's foreign policy department in 
addition to his role at the State Department, during which time he 
founded the Office of Global Youth Issues and served as an adviser to 
Secretary of State Hilary Clinton during the Arab Spring revolution.

His articles have been published in the Wall Street Journal, the International Herald Tribune and The Atlantic.

Claim: Mia Farrow has admitted Frank Sinatra may be the father of her son Ronan, instead of Woody Allen

Talented: Ronan Farrow has served as Special Adviser to the Secretary of State for Global Youth Issues (left), and has been accepted as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University for this Fall 

A
member of the New York Bar, Farrow, like his mother, Mia, has shown a 
special interest in protecting children caught in armed conflict zones 
and those suffering with AIDS.

If Farrow was to join MSNBC's new weekend lineup, it would signal something of a minor shakeup for the network.

Last month, MSNBC announced that 
Emmy-award winning actor, Alec Baldwin would be the host of a new Friday
night prime-time show called 'Up Late with Alec Baldwin', which will 
air at 10 p.m.

MSNBC 
president Phil Griffin has been reshuffling his prime-time lineups in 
recent weeks, but has shown a penchant for taking chances with 
less-experienced television news hosts.

Indeed, Al Sharpton was added to the lineup in 2011 and has been a success and according to the Hollywood Reporter, Griffin has been in discussions with Farrow for a while.

Ronan Farrow's precocious intelligence was recognized at age 11 when he became the youngest student to attend Bard College at Simon's Rock in Massachusetts.The school for gifted students usally accepts first-years at age 16 but he complete his senior thesis in political science and philosophy and graduated at age 15.Accepted into Yale Law School in Connecticut, Farrow deferred his admission until he was 18 so that he could work as an adviser to Richard Holbrooke, the former United States Ambassador to the United Nations.He was present the night that Holbrooke tragically died in December 2010 from complications arising from a torn aorta.From 2001-2009, he worked as a UNICEF spokesperson and visited Nigeria, Angola and Sudan, writing pieces on the protection of Darfuri refugees in Sudan.In additions to his studies at Yale, Farrow has worked at the State Department as an Obama administration appointment and one official speaking on condition of anonymity referred to him as 'a friggin' genius," adding that "he’s young but he has a depth of experience that many people twice his age lack.'He has written extensively as a journalist, especially on his experiences in Africa and in 2013 he co-authored an attack on the Congressional investigation of the 2012 Benghazi attack.He was serving as Special Adviser to the Secretary of State for Global Youth Issues but has left that post after accepted as Rhodes Scholar to Oxford University this fall.

The network refused to comment on the speculation.

Farrow himself has not commented on the MSNBC report, but did offer up a humorous tweet referencing his alleged father, Frank Sinatra.

'Listen, we’re all 'possibly' Frank Sinatra’s son,' he wrote to his 130,000 plus followers this morning.

Rumors about the parentage of her son Ronan, 25, have long dogged Mia Farrow, and she finally addressed the issue in an interview with Vanity Fair saying the legendary crooner was 'possibly' his father.

Farrow, now 68, said that Sinatra was the great love of her life, and says, 'We never really split up.'

When Vanity Fair asked Sinatra's daughter about Ronan being treated as if he were a member of her family, Nancy Sinatra Jr told them: 'He is a big part of us, and we are blessed to have him in our lives.'

Farrow married Sinatra in 1966 in Las Vegas when she was 21 and he was 50.

The marriage fell apart 18 months later when she refused to drop her critically-acclaimed performance in Rosemary's Baby to star in a movie with her husband. They divorced in 1968.

In 1980, Farrow started a long-term relationship with Woody Allen, although the two never lived together. Farrow became Allen's muse and starred in 13 of his films, most notable Hannah And Her Sisters in 1986.

Her relationship with Allen ended in 1992 when she discovered he was having an affair with her oldest adopted daughter, Soon-Yi Previn, then 22.

It was believed that the news Allen may not be his father could be welcome to Ronan - the pair had a very public falling out when Allen began his romantic relationship with Previn.

'He's my father and married to my sister. That makes me his son and his brother-in-law. That is such a moral transgression,' Ronan has said.

'I cannot see him. I cannot have a relationship with my father and be morally consistent... I lived with all these adopted children, so they are my family. To say Soon-Yi was not my sister is an insult to all adopted children,' Ronan said of the relationship.

Following the discovery of naked photos of Soon-Yi in Woody's possession, Farrow launched a messy custody battle over their three children.

And the strained relationship with his father doesn't seem to have held Ronan back; and he has been deemed a child prodigy.

He enrolled in Bard College at the age of 11, graduating at 15, and moving on to the prestigious Yale Law School and graduating by the age of 21- a year younger than most students finish their undergraduate degree.

Since leaving school, Ronan has worked as a special adviser to the State Department, specifically focusing on the youth issues in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

He has lent his face and name to charitable causes for years, serving as a UNICEF spokesperson from 2001 to 2009.

After working under Hillary Clinton in the State Department, Ronan is now moves into the ranks of her husband, former president Bill Clinton, with Monday's Rhodes scholarship nomination.
