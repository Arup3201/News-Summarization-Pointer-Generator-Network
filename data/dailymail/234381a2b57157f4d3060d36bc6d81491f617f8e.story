A notorious former strip club has been transformed into a luxury boutique hotel in Rhode Island, US.

Built around the history and culture of Providence, The Dean is a hotel that values collaboration with its neighbours. Filled with custom furniture, craftwork from local purveyors and found objects from Europe and beyond, The Dean revels in the details. 

But just three years ago the building was in disrepair - once used as a brothel and strip club, designer and developer Ari Heckman decided to breatehe new life into the dilapidated eyesore.

Designer and developer Ari Heckman has utilised original themes from the strip club in a fascinating new look

The bar where ladies would dance and entertain the crowds is now a chillout area - but notice the drawing on the wall and a hark back in time

The tired and tacky green shutters have been ripped off, and the exterior of the hotel looks fresh and inviting to the tourism industry

Built in 1912, the building was originally meant to house the clergy, but by the time Great Depression came around, it became a shelter for the poor and impoverished.

Then, as theatre took over the downtown Providence area, the building became a pit-stop for actors and actresses.

But then the area fell into decline, and it became a strip club, with 60 hourly rooms upstairs.

The renovation works took two-and-a-half years to complete, and now the building has had a much-needed focus

Interestingly, the shapes from the old strip club have been incorporated into the hotel's fresh and clean design

Ari Heckman used to walk past the strip club, and once it had shut down, he seized upon the opportunity for his next project

These rooms are a far cry to what was there before, where strippers used to entertain their clients, with the furniture of high standard

The bathrooms in the rooms at The Dean are beautifully designed and add a real touch of class to the building, and right, the bright walkways

Speaking to Curbed.com, Mr Heckman said: 'It was in that condition up until the moment we bought it. I went to the building on the last day of its active strip club life. The next day,the lights were off and that was the end of that.'

'There were definitely moments of panic, where it felt highly unrealistic that we would be able to make something out of that.

'There was nothing good happening in those rooms. They did everything wrong to make the space feel as disturbing as possible.' 

Fast forward two-and-a-half years and the refub is complete - rooms are eloquently designed with decor from New England and Belgium, while working with the original layout of the building and structure.

There is a restaurant, a coffee shop, a bar, and a karaoke lounge, as well as 52 beautifully-designed bedroom suites. Certain themes from its past remain, for example there is an artistic drawing of a naked woman on the walls of the bar.
