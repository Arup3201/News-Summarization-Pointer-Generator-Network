If you are one of the thousands of Britons planning to flip a pancake or two on Shrove Day tomorrow then your work just got made a whole lot easier.. or harder, depending on your grasp of science.

The formula for the perfect pancake mix has been revealed as 100 - [10L - 7F + C(k - C) + T(m - T)]/(S - E), and was developed by mathematicians at the University of Wolverhampton.

Retailer Debenhams unveiled the mathematical formula for the perfect pancake - claiming in the process to be able to eliminate sub-standard crepes across kitchens forever. 

Pancake perfection! 100 - [10L - 7F + C(k - C) + T(m - T)]/(S - E)

The science: The formula was developed by researchers at the University of Wolverhampton

Households all over the UK will be flipping traditional pancakes in celebration of Shrove Tuesday - in most cases, resulting in lumpy batter and floor splatter.

Spokesperson for Debenhams Lizzie Singleton explains: ‘L represents the number of lumps in the batter and C equals its consistency. F stands for the flipping score, k is the ideal consistency and T is the temperature of the pan.

‘The perfect pan temperature is represented by m, S is the time the batter stands before cooking and E is the time the cooked pancake stands before being eaten - the closer to 100 the result is, the better the pancake.’

Whether the formula will translate from paper to pancake pan is another matter entirely.

Sophie Bathgate, founder of Sophie’s restaurant in London offers her four top flipping tips.

Worried your home made pancakes will turn out a flop? Tempted to leave it to the professionals?

Don't be the first to flip!

With Shrove Tuesday fast approaching this February, pancake aficionado Sophie Bathgate and her pastry team share some top tips for how to make the perfect pancakes this Shrove Tuesday.

They certainly know what they're talking about too. During the first weekend of the launch of their 'Breakfast on the Beach' in Fulham Road, they knocked out over 300 pancakes before 10am.

1. Be prepared

Don't be afraid to prep in advance. Create your mix slowly with a generous pinch of rock salt the night before you plan to get flipping. Your pancakes will definitely taste better.

2. Don't go first

Use a heavy frying pan - it will help with the perfect flip action & wait until it's hot, hot, hot.

Be warned, if you are in a competitive environment, the first one is always a disappointment.

3. Thin is the name of the game

Smooth, round edges & as thin as you dare is what you are aiming for.

4. Embrace your inner child

Slide straight out of the frying pan, smear with Nutella & eat immediately. Heavenly!

Shoppers in search of the perfect 
pancake have been stocking up on new equipment over the past week, with 
frying pan sales up by 50 per cent at Debenhams, in a bid to wow their 
friends and families with the perfect pancake toss.

According
to the results of a Debenhams survey, 86 per cent of households will be
enjoying pancakes today, yet only 14 per cent of those surveyed are 
confident they know how to make, cook and flip the traditional Shrove 
Tuesday dessert.

Lizzie Singleton continues: ‘Coupled 
with the right frying pan, following this formula will result in perfect
pancakes all round!’

Hooray! Remember the perfect amount of time between cooking and eating is 0

‘Simplifying the science behind this formula, our customers can have perfect pancakes tonight.

'The golden rules seem to be to have a good pan at 377 degrees, have zero lumps in the mixture, and leave the batter to stand for 30 minutes before cooking, making sure the pancakes are eaten straight away – that seems simple enough.

‘Once victim to overzealous pancake tossers, floors and ceilings will be free from mess this year!’

Regional survey results showed that those in Liverpool and Birmingham were the shyest about their pancake skills, with only 4 per cent believing they would be flipping successfully.

Meanwhile, in the South East, 23 per cent of respondents were sure they had pancake tossing nailed and would be enjoying their pancakes triumphantly this evening.

The survey also found that tde most popular type of pancake filling is still the traditional lemon and sugar combination, with 56 per cent opting for this as their filling of choice.

Why not give them a try yourself using the formula for pancake perfection?

Remember when to watch out for lumps in your batter!

For the crepes:

For the sauce:

1. Sift the flour and salt into a large mixing bowl with a sieve held high above the bowl so the flour gets an airing. Now make a well in the centre of the flour and break the eggs into it. Then begin whisking the eggs - any sort of whisk or even a fork will do - incorporating any bits of flour from around the edge of the bowl as you do so.

2. Next gradually add small quantities of the milk and water mixture, still whisking (don’t worry about any lumps as they will eventually disappear as you whisk). When all the liquid has been added, use a rubber spatula to scrape any elusive bits of flour from around the edge into the centre, then whisk once more until the batter is smooth, with the consistency of thin cream. Now melt the 50g of butter in a pan. Spoon 2 tbsp of it into the batter and whisk it in, then pour the rest into a bowl and use it to lubricate the pan, using a wodge of kitchen paper to smear it round before you make each pancake. Stir the orange zest and caster sugar into the batter.

3. Now get the pan really hot, then turn the heat down to medium and, to start with, do a test pancake to see if you’re using the correct amount of batter. These little crêpes should be thinner than the basic pancakes, so when you’re making them, use ½ tbsp of batter at a time in a 18cm pan. It’s also helpful if you spoon the batter into a ladle so it can be poured into the hot pan in one go. As soon as the batter hits the hot pan, tip it around from side to side to get the base evenly coated with batter. It should take only half a minute or so to cook; you can lift the edge with a palette knife to see if it’s tinged gold as it should be.

4 Flip the pancake over with a pan slice or palette knife - the other side will need a few seconds only - then simply slide it out of the pan onto a plate. If the pancakes look a little bit ragged in the pan, no matter because they are going to be folded anyway. You should end up with 15-16 crêpes.

5. Stack the pancakes as you make them between sheets of greaseproof paper on a plate fitted over simmering water, to keep them warm while you make the rest.

6. For the sauce, mix all the ingredients - with the exception of the butter - in a bowl. At the same time warm the plates on which the crêpes are going to be served. Now melt the butter in the frying pan, pour in the sauce and allow it to heat very gently.

Then place the first crêpes in the pan and give it time to warm through before folding it in half and then in half again to make a triangular shape. Slide this onto the very edge of the pan, tilt the pan slightly so the sauce runs back into the centre, then add the next crêpe. Continue like this until they’re all re-heated, folded and well soaked with the sauce.

7. You can flame them at this point if you like. Heat a ladle by holding it over a gas flame or by resting it on the edge of a hotplate, then, away from the heat, pour a little Marmalade Vodka into it, return it to the heat to warm the spirit, then set light to it. Carry the flaming ladle to the table over the pan and pour the flames over the crêpes before serving on the warmed plates. Enjoy!
