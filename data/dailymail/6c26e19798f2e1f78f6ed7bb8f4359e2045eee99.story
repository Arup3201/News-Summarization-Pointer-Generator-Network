Police investigating 
the tragic death of an Atlanta toddler apparently left alone for hours 
in a hot car by his father have raised the possibility that the tragedy 
may not have been an accident.

Justin
 Ross Harris, 33, was supposed to drop his toddler, identified in 
reports as Cooper, to daycare around 9 a.m. Wednesday but instead went 
straight to work, apparently forgetting the boy was strapped in his car 
seat in the back of the vehicle for seven hours.

Police
 already hold Harris responsible and have charged him with murder and 
cruelty to children in the first degree, but inconsistencies in his 
story have led police to openly question if what the Home Depot employee
 is saying is true.

Tragedy: Baby Cooper with his father Justin Ross Harris - who has been charged with murder and cruelty to children in the first degree after the death of his son in Atlanta on Wednesday

'Much has changed about 
the circumstances leading up to the death of this 22-month-old since it 
was first reported,' Cobb County Police Sgt. Dana Pierce told CNN.

'I've
 been in law enforcement for 34 years. What I know about this case 
shocks my conscience as a police officer, a father and a 
grandfather,'said Pierce.

Having
 initially told police he forgot to drop his child off at daycare and 
then traveled onto work, Harris phoned 911 at around 4.20pm in hysterics
 screaming, 'What I have done?'

'Within
 moments of the first responders getting to the scene and doing their 
job and questions began to be asked about the moments that led up to 
their arrival at the scene, some of those answers were not making sense 
to the first responders,' Pierce of Cobb County Police said.

On
 Thursday, Harris pleaded not guilty to felony murder and cruelty to 
children charges. He's being held without bond at the Cobb County Jail.

Ominously
 for Harris' story, Pierce told CNN On Friday, 'I cannot confirm that 
the child, as originally reported, was in the car at 9am.'

It wasn't until 4 p.m., when he was driving home, that Harris claims he noticed his son was lifeless in the back seat.

He
 pulled over the SUV at the Akers Mill Square shopping center on Cobb 
Parkway and tried to perform CPR on the boy but it was too late.

A witness, Dale Hamilton, said told CBS46 he saw the distraught father pull the child out of the car and attempt to resuscitate him.

'He was constantly saying, "What have I done, what have I done?"' Hamilton said.

Police added that he had to be restrained at the scene because he was so upset.

The child was pronounced dead at the scene.

Harris is being held without bond in the Cobb County Jail.

The high temperature in Atlanta was 91 degrees Wednesday.

A
 police warrant states Harris, who goes by Ross and works at Home Depot,
 admitted he left the 22-month-old unattended and strapped into his 
child car seat in the parked vehicle for approximately seven hours 
during the day before finding him unresponsive.

'It's just a terrible, God-awful situation,' Cobb County District Attorney Vic Reynolds told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

'I can't 
imagine, I can't fathom what any parent would be going through at this 
stage. It's the type of case that affects the community.'

An autopsy
 will be conducted by the Cobb County Medical Examiner's Office to 
determine the cause of death for the child, police said.

Harris, a Tuscaloosa, Alabama, native, had been working at Home Depot for just over two years.

Harris,
 his wife and Cooper were renting a condo off Terrell Mill Road, but 
hoped to buy a home, their landlord, Joe Saini, told the news website.

He described Harris and his wife as 'very, very nice' people who loved her son dealy.

'Everything
 was going right for this couple,' Saini said. 'They wanted to buy a 
house so they could have some space for their child to run around the 
backyard.'
