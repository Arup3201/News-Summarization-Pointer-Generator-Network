Loss: A'Darrin Washington was found dead in a taxi after being 'forcibly removed from hospital'

A dying patient who was escorted out of a North Carolina hospital for being 'uncooperative' was loaded into a taxi where he was later found dead by his mother, she has claimed.

Deborah Washington has filed a lawsuit against AlliedBurton Security Services claiming their staff at Cumberland County Hospital forcibly removed her adult son even though he was dying or already dead.

She claims that the guards took A'Darrin Washington, 30, from the hospital, carried him from his wheelchair to a waiting taxi, buckled him up and sent him home even though he was gravely ill.

Mr Washington was found dead in the back of the taxi when he arrived home 45 minutes later.

He had been discharged from the hospital on November 22, 2011 after undergoing treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and fungal pneumonia - after initially being misdiagnosed.

A nurse had called for security to escort him from his bed to the lobby to be discharged because he was 'uncooperative' and 'refusing to talk or move', the lawsuit said, CourtHouseNews reported.

But his heartbroken mother claims he was simply not cooperating with staff 'due to the fact that he was dying'.

Devastated: His mother, Deborah Washington, left, has sued the security company whose guards allegedly carried her son, right, from his wheelchair and put him inside the taxi after he was 'unresponsive'

As Mr Washington was taken from the 
hospital, at least two hospital staff expressed concern over his 
treatment, the complaint says - and even the taxi driver said he was 
worried the man was dead.

The staff put him in the taxi and even crossed his legs, UPI reported.

He
 remained unconscious for the entire 45-minute ride back home and when 
he got there, he was cold to the touch, the complaint said.

His mother claims that the body was then left in the taxi in front of the house for four hours while police investigated.

Mr Washington had been suffering from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and had undergone treatment at the hospital for 10 years.

On November 14, he was admitted to the hospital for pneumonia and treated for bacterial pneumonia for several days. But tests then showed he was actually suffering from fungal bacteria.

Scene: Mr Washington was receiving treatment at Cumberland County Hospital for cancer and pneumonia

His mother claims that, after 
receiving the wrong medication, his condition had deteriorated. He was 
finally given the right medication the day before his death.

After the treatment, he was deemed to be stable and was prepared for discharge. His mother claimed he was too ill to leave but hospital staff insisted, she said.

On her Facebook profile, Mrs Washington shared an image of her deceased son earlier this month and said that she is still hurting and cries when no one if around.

She is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for negligence, wrongful death and emotional distress.

MailOnline has contacted AlliedBarton for a comment regarding the case.
