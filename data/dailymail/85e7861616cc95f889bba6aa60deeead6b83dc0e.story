A serving police officer has been charged with murdering his wife at their home - just yards from the force HQ.

PC Otis Goldsmith, 49, was arrested at 1pm on Thursday at his £140,000 semi-detached home in Wootton Hall Park, Northampton.

The houses were formerly owned by Northamptonshire Police before being sold off privately and many were bought by serving and retired officers.

Today, police confirmed PC Goldsmith had been charged with the murder of his 49-year-old wife Jill Goldsmith.

He was remanded in custody at a hearing of Corby Magistrates Court earlier today.  

Police also revealed a forensic post-mortem examination of Mrs Goldsmith conducted on Friday confirmed the cause of death as a head injury.

The road of about 30 semi-detached houses where PC Goldsmith lived is on the same site as Northamptonshire Police HQ Wootton Hall.

The houses back onto the police training facilities and a council-run sports ground.

Officers cordoned off the property on Friday as well as two cars which were parked outside the house.

Earlier this week, PC Goldsmith's elderly mother Sylvia and father Michael, both 81, who live in nearby Rushden, Northamptonshire, expressed their distress at their son's arrest.

PC Goldsmith is expected to appear in court later today 

Mrs Goldsmith said: 'We don't know any details about what happened but Otis has been arrested.

'He and Jill only married last year. This is a very difficult time for us all.' 

PC Goldsmith has three sons from a previous marriage, twins aged 17 and another aged 20. His wife, a former domestic cleaner, is believed to have had a 22-year-old son from a previous marriage.

The officer's ex-wife Catherine Goldsmith, 52, the mother to his children, also confirmed he had been arrested on suspicion of murder.

Speaking on Friday, Northamptonshire Police Superintendent Chris Hillery confirmed the arrested officer had almost 28 years of service with the force.

He said: 'I would like to offer mine, and Northamptonshire Police's condolences to the family and friends of the victim of this incident.

'A referral was made to the Independent Police Complaints Commission because the incident involved a death and a serving police officer.

'The IPCC will not be conducting a murder investigation itself which, as with all murder investigations in Northamptonshire, is being led by the East Midlands Special Operations Unit.

'Around 50 officers are working on the case from the region, including in Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire and Derbyshire.

'Otis Goldsmith has served with Northamptonshire Police for nearly 28 years. What has happened has understandably shocked and upset many people on the local community.

'I would like to offer our sincere condolences to those affected.' 

The road of about 30 semi-detached houses is on the same site as Northamptonshire Police HQ Wootton Hall.

Police also arranged for a car to be removed from the scene of Thursday's crime
