A defiant Colonel Gaddafi today denied he had fled Libya claiming he 'won't leave the land of his ancestors'.

From his hiding place, the former leader told Syrian TV station Al Rai in an audio message he has not escaped to neighbouring Niger and maintains he is still in the country he led for 42 years.

Despite the dramatic collapse of his rule he also said that his army is in place to wrestle the country back from the rebels.

In an angry outburst Gaddafi also blasted those who ousted him.

'All of these germs, rats and scumbags, 
they are not Libyans, ask anyone. They have co-operated with Nato ... 
Gaddafi won't leave the land of his ancestors,' he said.

'We are ready to start the fight in Tripoli and everywhere else, and rise against them'.

The five minute broadcast came amid conflicting statements and speculation about the 69-year-old's  whereabouts.

He added: 'Our resolute Libyan people, the Libyan land is your own. Those who try to take it from you now, they are intruders, they are mercenaries, they are stray dogs.

'They are trying to seize our ancestral land from you but this is impossible. We will not leave our ancestral land.

'The youths are now ready to escalate the resistance against the 'rats' (transitional forces) in Tripoli and to finish off the mercenaries.'

He tried to counteract what he portrayed as a propaganda war, telling his followers: 'They are trying to demoralize you.'

The authenticity of the recording could not be verified but the voice and style strongly resembled Gaddafi, who has used the TV channel in the past.

Gaddafi has not been seen in public for months. He went into hiding after opposition fighters swept into Tripoli on August 21 and has released only audio messages trying to rally his supporters and lash out at his opponents.

Convoys of former regime loyalists, 
including Gaddafi's security chief, fled across the Sahara into Niger 
this week in a move that Libya's former rebels hoped could help lead to 
the surrender of the last bastions of his support.

It was rumoured that Gaddafi was among the convoy, but Niger has denied that the former Libyan leader had entered the country.

It has led to the NTC to send envoys to neighbouring countries to ask them to deny him entry.

'We're asking every country not to accept him. We want these people for justice,' Fathi Baja, the NTC's head of political affairs said.

He said Gaddafi might be close to the Niger or Algerian borders, waiting for an opportunity to slip across. 'He's looking for a chance to leave,' he added.

The former rebels are still battling regime loyalists in three Gaddafi strongholds - Bani Walid, Sabha and Sirte.

The key battle has now seemingly moved to the town of Bani Walid, 90 miles south east of Tripoli, where Gaddafi is now believed to be staying.

Fresh clashes broke out overnight and early today as Gaddafi loyalists fired at least 10 rockets along the desert front line at the town.

It followed early morning skirmishes in the same area.

Smoke billowed from where the projectiles landed in Wadi Dinar, about 12 miles outside the town, as the former rebels said the projectiles fired were Grad rockets.

It has led to thousands of 'rebel' fighters converging on the area, who are threatening to attack if residents 
do not surrender by Saturday.

A convoy of NTC pickup trucks was reported to be heading towards the 
town with dozens of fighters clutching rocket-propelled grenades and 
shouting anti-Gaddafi slogans.

'We will move into Bani Walid slowly. There was a message in Bani Walid 
from Gaddafi,' NTC unit commander Jamal Gourji 
said.            

'He was rallying his troops and calling on people to fight. He is hiding
in a hole in the ground, like Iraq,' he added, in reference to late 
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein who was captured nine 
months after his regime was toppled in 2003.        

Yesterday
more truckloads of former rebels arrived outside Bani Walid, a dusty 
city of 100,000 strung along the low ridges overlooking a dried up 
desert river valley on the road connecting Gaddafi's hometown of Sirte 
and Sabha to the south.

'That would explain why Bani Walid is resisting,' NTC negotiator Abdallah Kanshil said of reports of Gaddafi's presence in the town. 'His two sons are definitely there.'

The Pentagon said it had no information to indicate the fallen leader had left his North African homeland.

The U.S. said it had also contacted the governments of Niger, Mali, Mauritania, Chad and Burkina Faso - a swathe of poor former French colonies which benefited from Gaddafi's oil-fueled largesse in Africa.

The State Department urged them to secure their borders and to detain and disarm Gaddafi officials.              

Gaddafi and his son, Saif al-Islam, are wanted for crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court in The Hague.

British Foreign Secretary William Hague said any country where he was found should hand him over to be tried, remarks that were echoed by the U.S. ambassador to Libya, Gene Cretz.

Finding Gaddafi would help seal the new rulers' hold on the country, and likely trigger the collapse of the remaining regime loyalists still fighting the former rebels.
