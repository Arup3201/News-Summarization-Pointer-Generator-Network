Actor Sir Derek Jacobi has said that traditional Shakespeare performances where lines are recited like poetry 'send me to sleep'.

The 74-year-old said that the plays should be delivered in the way that a character 'thinks, feels and speaks'.

Speaking at the close of the Cheltenham Literature Festival, Sir Derek said actors should be looking to ensure that the audience understands.

Delivery: Sir Derek Jacobi, seen here on stage performing in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, said that actors should deliver lines clearly rather than reciting them like poetryÂ 

Performer: Sir Derek Jacobi who has appeared in Henry V, Gladiator, Gosford Park and the King's Speech

He joked that the old-fashioned 
approach of focusing on the rhythm of each line 'enhances my ignorance 
of what they're saying', the Daily Telegraph reported.

Sir Derek is an acclaimed theatre actor but has appeared on screen in Henry V, Gladiator, Gosford Park and the King's Speech.

In the past he has claimed that William Shakespeare's plays were in fact written by Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford.

He claimed the Earl hid behind the Bard because a nobleman could not be seen as a common playwright.

He said: 'The simple fact is the earl could not be seen as a common playwright. He was living in a Stasi-type London,' he said.

Addressing
the literature festival, Sir Derek said actors should ignore the 
punctuation in Shakespeare's plays and read the lines normally and 
naturally.

He said that actors need to show 'a healthy disrespect for punctuation'.

He added: 'Go for the meaning, that meaning that will ricochet round the auditorium.

'They
will then not have that fear that a lot of audiences have, sitting 
there thinking I don't understand this. Your job as an actor is to make 
them understand.'
