Tottenham are set to rival Liverpool for the signature of MK Dons teenage star Dele Alli.

Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino went to stadium:mk to watch Alli play in MK Dons' shock 4-0 Capital One Cup win against Manchester United.

And the 18-year-old midfielder did not disappoint as he shone in the centre of the park among United's multi-million pound stars.

Alli, an England Under 19 star, is on fire this season with six goals in 11 games including a hat-trick last weekend against Crewe.

Liverpool had a £3.5million bid rejected by MK Dons in the summer, but Spurs are set to fight it out for his signature in January.

Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich are also showing interest in the player.

MK Dons manager Robinson, seen here congratulating Alli on Saturday, believes he is worth £10m 

Alli signed a new three-year contract at MK Dons last week, but the club will struggle to keep hold of him when the transfer window opens.

His manager Karl Robinson claimed Alli is now in the £10million bracket after his performance against Crewe.

But a lesser offer is likely to tempt them to let the player seal a dream Premier League move from the League One club.
