A frustrated estate agent has taken a unique approach to selling a run-down three bedroom house - by blaming the property's less than sparkling appearance on 'some scumbag tenants'.

The modest house in the city of Hamilton, western Victoria, was on the market for $109,000 before it was sold to a family who were ready to take on the challenge.

A strikingly honest advertisement for the 'do-er up-er' on website RealEstate.com.au called the property a 'redecorator's delight'.

Estate agent Helen Morrison told Daily Mail Australia her advertisement was a 'one off' and she wrote it in that way because 'it had been trashed' by 'squatters' who refused to pay rent.

Honest: This small three bedroom house in Hamilton, western Victoria, was given a very frank advertisement

Trashed: One of the bedrooms (left) appears dingy and dirty. Two windows in the living room were smashed and the wooden floor was covered in marks (right)

'Very solid 3 BR WB with tiled roof - which has been trashed by some scumbag tenants. It's being sold "as is" and it needs redecoration,' the advert reads.

On the upside, it states: 'Other than replacing a few cracked or broken windows, all the work needed could be done by anyone who is a bit "handy".'

The pictures of the property that accompany the ad show its washed out walls and dirty looking cream curtains that are only half hanging on their rails.

Telling it how it is: Estate agent Helen Morrison said her advertisement was a 'one off'

The outdated cupboards have been stripped bare, the wooden floor in the living room looks marked and dirty, and the white bathroom floor also appears to be still muddy.

'It is a home which has had a second living room added to it and prior to the aforementioned tenants from hell, this was a delightful little home in a quiet court, very close to the golf course,' the estate agent said.

'It has a double garage and can be purchased as it stands for only $109,000... It's an excellent "Do-er Up-er",' she added.

'Redecorator's delight': The advertisement for the 'do-er up-er' was published on website RealEstate.com.au

Outdated: Even after the kitchen had been scrubbed up it still needed some serious redecoration

Muddy: The white bathroom floor looked dirty (left) and dirty curtains were left hanging off their rails (right)

Ms Morrison said the unwanted tenants had been in the house for 'some months'.

'I think it started out as someone who was a friend of the owner who went to work over in Western Australia. But then they left and then another lot moved in and they didn't pay rent,' she explained.

'After a while nobody knew who was living there and they just trashed the place.'

Ruined: There were dozens of marks on the purple wall of one of the bedrooms

Ms Morrison said they did not have to get anyone to evict the squatters because the owner 'got them out in the end'.

Despite the honest advert, the estate agent said she had 'a lot of inspections and interest' in the property.

'It's been sold now and the people that bought it have done a great job at doing it up.'

Happy ending: The property now has new owners and they've given it the redecoration that it needed
