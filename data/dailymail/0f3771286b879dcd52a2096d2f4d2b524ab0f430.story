Just hours after Phillip Hughes succumbed to the most freakish of sports injuries, it was revealed he had earned himself his cherished Test recall.

The poignant news was revealed by Test selector Mark Waugh, just hours after Hughes died on Thursday afternoon at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney.

If a 135kmh bouncer hadn't cannoned into the side of his neck at the SCG on Tuesday, Hughes would be preparing to don the baggy green cap for the 27th time, playing against India at the Gabba in a week's time.

In a bewildering mix of tragedy and bizarre timing, Test selector Mark Waugh - who watched Hughes make an untroubled 63 before he fatefully mistimed a pull shot two days ago - admitted the left-hander was poised to replace injured captain Michael Clarke in the first Test line-up.

'It makes it an even tougher pill to swallow,' Waugh told Fox Sports.

Just 25, Hughes died on Thursday afternoon in St Vincent's Hospital of vertebral artery dissection, an extremely rare medical problem in which the artery to the brain is torn.

It's only been reported 100 times, just once before in cricket and St Vincent's had never seen a case.

Hughes - Australia's 408th Test player - was one of the most likeable cricketers across the country.

Renowned as a fighter since marking his debut Test series with sensational success as a 20-year-old against South Africa in 2009, Hughes had been vying for a fourth recall to the Australian side.

Australian Cricketers Association chief executive Alistair Nicholson described the gritty batsman in a nutshell.

'Phillip Hughes died playing the sport that he loved amongst those who loved him,' Nicholson said.

'His final shot typified his approach to the game - aggressive, positive and defiant.'

Tears flowed as Test and interstate teammates, as well as former captain Ricky Ponting and Steve Waugh, gathered at St Vincent's throughout Thursday to say their final farewell - ending a two-day bedside vigil after he was placed in an induced coma.

Great mate David Warner was inconsolable, while Clarke - described as a big brother to the batsman - was singled out for his great love and care for his friend, and support to his grief-stricken family.

'The family was obviously going through a difficult time but I'm not sure they would have coped without Michael's assistance,' said Australian team doctor Peter Brukner.

Early Thursday evening, Hughes' parents and sister were joined by several players, including Warner, Ponting, Peter Siddle, James Pattinson and Aaron Finch, at the SCG.

His mother Virginia was inconsolable as she left.

Flowers, Australian and Barmy Army flags, as well as a cricket ball and bat have been laid outside the nearby Cricket NSW offices.

News of Hughes' death brought tributes from around the world with cricket luminaries like Ian Botham and Sachin Tendulkar joining Prime Minister Tony Abbott offering condolences.

Play in the Test match between New Zealand and Pakistan in Sharjah was called off for the day while the flags at Lord's - the home of cricket - flew at half-mast.

Cricket Australia chief James Sutherland said tragedy was a word uttered too often in sport, but this was real life tragedy.

'Phil has been taken away from us to soon,' Sutherland said. 'It's an understatement to say we're completely devastated.

'The impact of Phillip's loss is enormous.'

With questions now hovering over staging the Gabba Test, Sutherland said it was too early to consider calling the game off.
