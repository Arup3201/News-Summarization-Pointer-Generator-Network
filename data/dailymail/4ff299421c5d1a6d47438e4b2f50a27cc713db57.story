Set in the sprawling plains of English countryside, this is the retreat that former England rugby hero Jonny Wilkinson claims saved his career.

The 19th century mansion in Northumberland is shrouded in five acres of idyllic fields.

And the pool, gym and sauna aren't half bad either.

Retreat: Jonny Wilkinson, who recently retired from the game, said being able to build his own gym and concentrate on his fitness helped save his career

Idyllic: Forced to put his Northumberland home on the market as he moves to France, the former fly half gushes about its sprawling acres of land

Now taking up a coaching role with French club Toulon, the fly half is putting his seven-bedroom home on the market.

Jonny, who recently retired from the 
game, said being able to build his own gym and concentrate on his 
fitness helped save his career.

He said: 'When I went through my injury period between 2004 and 2007, I just couldn't stay fit and I was struggling.

'It was then I decided to extend the property to include space for a gym and a swimming pool.

'It
 kind of saved my career. My whole life was about doing rehab and gym 
work to try and stay fit and get back into my job. It became a bit of a 
retreat almost.

Homely: The 19th century mansion is a mix of modern and old fashioned features, with oak wood panelling decking the breakfasting kitchen

Luxurious: Would-be buyers will no doubt be lured by the custom-built outhouse with a swimming pool and sauna and three extra bedrooms upstairs

Outdoors: Jonny has enjoyed 10 years in the Northumberland countryside, with a basketball net by the 3.5 acres of paddocks for games outside

'I could do what I had to do, but still have all the peace and quiet that comes with the house.'

Potential buyers can look forward to dips in the custom-built pool, which is in a separate outhouse with a sauna and, upstairs, three spare bedrooms.

The main house has five reception rooms, a breakfasting kitchen, four double bedrooms and three bathrooms.

With one and a half acres of formal gardens, the new owner will also have three and a half acres of paddocks to enjoy.

And, of course, they will no doubt be lured by the 16 square-foot gym and adjacent weights room, where Jonny honed his stellar career. 

Renovated: Now worth £1.5 million, Jonny spent years renovating the idyllic home that has five reception rooms with an extension and outhouse

Jonny added: 'The views go on forever. It's that kind of thing that I'm going to miss. It's that beautiful and that much of a privilege to live here.

'But at the same time, it's one of those things when suddenly your life takes shape in front of you and you have to move on.

'The house is very special to me as it's where I spent the mainstay of my rugby career.'

Rowan Tree Grange, Northumberland, is for sale through Foster Madison at a guide price of £1.5m.The house dates from the late 1800s and has been updated throughout.
