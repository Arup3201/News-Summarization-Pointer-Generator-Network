Ezell Ford, 25, was shot dead by officers in South Los Angeles on Monday evening

An eyewitness to the death of Ezell Ford has claimed an officer with the LAPD shouted 'shoot him' just before the mentally ill unarmed 25-year-old was fatally shot on Monday.

The Huffington Post claims witness, Leroy Hill, saw an officer with the LAPD shoot Ford three times while he was on the ground and that he saw the entire incident unfold in front of him.

Hill denied that Ford had any association with Los Angeles gangs and claimed that officers ambushed him as he walked down the street.

'He wasn't a gang banger at all,' said Hill said to HuffPost.

'I was sitting across the street when it happened. So as he was walking down the street, the police approached him, whatever was said I couldn't hear it, but the cops jumped out of the car and rushed him over here into this corner.

'They had him in the corner and were beating him, busted him up, for what reason I don't know he didn't do nothing.

'The next thing I know I hear a 'pow!' while he's on the ground. They got the knee on him. And then I hear another 'pow!' No hesitation. And then I hear another 'pow!' Three times.'

Ezell Ford, 25, was allegedly shot dead by officers in the Florence neighbourhood in South Los Angeles on Monday evening.

His family say Mr Ford was complying with police orders and was lying down when he was fatally shot at the intersection of West 65th Street and South Broadway at 8.12pm.

According to Lietenant Ellis Imaizumi of the Los Angeles Police Department, officers were carrying out an 'investigative stop' during which a 'struggle ensued' and police opened fire.

Mr Ford was taken to hospital but later died of his injuries.

According to police, no officers were injured.

Speaking to KTLA, Ezell Ford said her son was shot three times while he was lying on the ground and following the officers' orders.

She also said they refused to tell her which hospital her son had been taken too but this has been denied by LAPD.

Another relative said Mr Ford had mental health problems. He said: 'They laid him out and for whatever reason, they shot him in the back, knowing mentally, he has complications.

'Every officer in this area, from the Newton Division, knows that — that this child has mental problems.

A Facebook page calling for justice for Ezell Ford has now been set up and a rally has been organised for Sunday at 3pm at LAPD headquarters.

The shooting came two days after Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, was killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri.

A third 
night of violent protests flared up in Ferguson, Missouri, as 
police in riot gear and armored trucks trained high-powered rifles on 
protesters. 

Police
 revealed today that a woman had been shot in the head in an alleged 
drive-by shooting in Ferguson on Tuesday night while in a separate 
incident, a police officer reportedly shot an armed man.

It was unclear whether the shootings were connected to the protests, according to NBC reports.

According to WBNS, four men wearing ski masks and armed with shotguns believed to be staging a robbery were apprehended by officers.

One
 suspect confronted an officer with a handgun. The officer, who feared 
for his life said a police spokesman, shot the armed subject.

The alleged robber was taken to hospital in critical condition.

In
 a separate incident, a woman was shot once in the head during a 
drive-by shooting, police reported. She was taken to hospital and is 
expected to live.

The
 Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) has established a no-fly zone over 
Ferguson after police said one of their helicopters was fired upon on 
multiple occasions. The ban will remain in place until Monday.

Following a rally by civil rights leader Al Sharpton on Tuesday, crowds confronted police and refused orders to disperse.

Police fired more tear gas on the protests but overall, the situation did not escalate as it had on previous nights. 

On
 Sunday and Monday nights, tensions have run high in Ferguson where 
crowds looted and burned stores, vandalized vehicles and taunted 
police. 

Riot officers dressed in tactical gear shot rubber bullets and bean-bag rounds at protesters who volleyed rocks in return. 

At
 a rally held by Reverend Sharpton on Tuesday night, the mother of 
Michael Brown, Lesley McSpadden, demanded that the police officer who 
shot her son come forward.

'You
 take your punishment,' Lesley McSpadden said. 'If you were a man you'd 
stand up, you'd be a man, you would say you was wrong.'

Reverend
 Sharpton added: 'The local authorities have put themselves in a 
position - hiding names and not being transparent - where people will 
not trust anything but an objective investigation.'

Her plea comes as Ferguson police refused to name of the officer in question, citing death threats made on social media.

The police claim that the teenager assaulted the police officer in the street on Saturday and made a grab for his weapon.

That claim is entirely refuted by Brown's friend, Dorian Johnson, who was within feet of the entire incident. 

Mr
 Johnson, 22, said his friend fled from the officer after being shot 
once, held his hands up and shouted that he was unarmed. The officer 
then repeatedly fired shots at Brown, Mr Johnson said.

Police admit that Brown was shot 'a couple of times' but could not give an exact number.

Vigils have been planned across the U.S. on Thursday in response to recent alleged acts of police brutality including the killing of 18-year-old Brown.

Organized by a movement called the National Moment Of Silence, vigils are being planned in 50 cities across 30 states.

President Obama released a statement on Tuesday where he addressed the teen's shooting.

He
 said: 'The death of Michael Brown is heartbreaking, and Michelle and I 
send our deepest condolences to his family and his community at this 
very difficult time.

'As Attorney General Holder has indicated, the 
Department of Justice is investigating the situation along with local 
officials, and they will continue to direct resources to the case as 
needed. 

'I
 know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but
 as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across 
the country, to remember this young man through reflection and 
understanding. 

'We
 should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that 
heals, not in a way that wounds. Along with our prayers, that’s what 
Michael and his family, and our broader American community, deserve.'
