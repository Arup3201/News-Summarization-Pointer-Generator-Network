An innocent couple were accused of battering their month-old baby who was taken away and put up for adoption after the baby milk they fed him caused rickets.

Social workers, experts and even a judge had assumed the child had been the victim of horrific abuse after he was found to have suffered broken bones.

After hearing expert evidence in June 
last year, a judge at Sheffield High Court ruled that one or other of 
the parents must have been responsible for the injuries.

London's Appeal Court heard there is evidence that the boy was born with a Vitamin D deficiency, inherited from his mother, and that this led to 'soft bones' and rickets

The same judge refused to change her mind earlier this year and freed the boy for adoption.

Now, however, the parents have been given a final chance to get him back after lawyers had a 'light bulb moment' and understood the full significance of the youngster’s medical records.

Michael Shrimpton, for the family, from the Sheffield area, told London’s Appeal Court that there is evidence that the boy was born with a Vitamin D deficiency, inherited from his mother, and that this led to 'soft bones' and rickets.

Although blood tests carried out when he was four weeks old were normal, the barrister said his congenital condition would by then have been 'masked' by the formula milk given to him by his mother - which contained Vitamin D supplements.

Mr Shrimpton argued that rickets was the true explanation for multiple broken bones suffered by the baby boy which could have been caused during his difficult forceps birth, or even in-utero.

He pointed to 'striking' medical records which showed severe abnormalities in the functioning of the baby boy’s liver, an organ instrumental in processing Vitamin D.

Now Lord Justice McFarlane has intervened in the case, directing that the evidence be reviewed by a fresh medical expert.

Mr Shrimpton said that one of the country’s top endocrinologists, Professor Stephen Nussey, who has carried out pioneering work on the causes and effects of Vitamin D deficiency, will be instructed to carry out that task if he is available at short notice.

Observing that medical knowledge on the causes of infant injuries is in a state of contant movement, the barrister added: 'This is an important case. It is starting to take on the appearance of a leading test case'.

However, Lord Justice McFarlane observed: 'Medical knowledge of how some children may have bones that are more susceptible to injury than normal children has moved on'.

He added that there was no evidence of emotional difficulties, domestic violence, alcohol or drug abuse, or any signs of dysfunction within the family, to indicate a risk of child abuse.

Emphasising the extreme urgency of the case in light of plans for the boy’s imminent adoption, the judge gave the parents 28 days to obtain a report from Professor Nussey, or another expert, in support of their case.

Recognising the parents’ 'exceptionally awful' experience in having their child taken from them, he said the court would carefully examine whether the Vitamin D deficiency explanation for the boy’s injuries was 'more than an intellectual possibility'.

The local authority involved in the case had informed the Appeal Court that suitable adoptive parents have already been found for the boy but no further steps in the process would be taken prior to the court ruling on the case.

The case will return to the Appeal Court once the expert medical report has been obtained.

But his broken bones were really caused by an inherited Vitamin D deficiency
