Vladimir Putin is hoping to return the Russian people to its former vigour – by re-introducing Soviet-era mass exercise.

This week, Putin signed an executive order to bring back the Ready for Labor and Defence programme, to improve the fitness of the population.

The Russian President, who in 2008 released an instructional judo DVD called 'Let's Learn Judo with Vladimir Putin', will use unused funds from the Sochi Olympics to revive the plan.

Speaking in the Kremlin on Monday, Putin said that reinstating the plan, first introduced in the 1930s under Joseph Stalin and known in Russia by the acronym GTO, would ‘pay homage to our national historical traditions’.

During the Soviet days, Russians of all ages were expected to participate in GTO.

 In the final years of high school education, teenagers were enlisted in the Strength and Courage-programme, where they would undergo basic military training.

Men aged 40 to 50, and women aged 35-55, would take part in the Vigor and Health-programme, and local branches of GTO would hold their own annual championships.

This week Putin said the leftover Sochi funds support sports venues and promote healthy lifestyles among Russians from the age of six.

‘The Olympics and Paralympics have demonstrated that we are again becoming one of the leaders in global sports,’ Putin said, after his country hosted the $50-billion games.

Putin frequently harks back to the Soviet era to appeal to nostalgic Russians, and the move coincides with the recent annexation of Crimea.

Bioth the U.S. and the EU have imposed sanctions on Russia over the move, even excluding Putin from the G8 group.

However, the annexation of Crimea has boosted Putin's popularity at home, where almost half of Russians said the move, according to a poll by the independent Levada Center published earlier this month.

Putin's own approval ratings were at 72 per cent, up from 65 per cent at the beginning of the year, according to another poll published by Levada this month.

The president has been seeking to increase Russians' life expectancy and stem a demographic decline that has seen the population fall to below 142 million in 2011 from 148.6 million in 1991, the year the Soviet Union collapsed.
