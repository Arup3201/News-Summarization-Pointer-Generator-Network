Jennifer Aniston's yoga instructor Mandy Ingber has opened up about how her star client 'tightens up' when 'preparing for a romantic trip' with fiance Justin Theroux.

'She focuses on butt exercises for 
sure, I'll add some squats into the yoga routine, Ms Ingber told ABC News. 'For me, there's no better thing to lift your butt than squats. Pretty 
much, that's gonna do it...
 Most of us want that area a little higher.'

According 
to the much sought-after yoga guru, simply staying on track with her diet - and avoiding the 'extra chips' - is also key to the 45-year-old Friends star's impressive physique.

Slim: Jennifer Aniston's yoga instructor Mandy Ingber has spilled the beans on how her star client 'tightens up', claiming, 'she focuses on butt exercises for sure... and she won't have the extra chips'

'Jen's a very consistent exerciser and 
eater,' Ms Ingber says. 'But when she has something she needs to focus a 
little more on, she just tightens it up a little bit. She won't have the
 extra chips.'

In addition to butt exercises, Ms Ingber, who sees Ms Aniston three times a week and who also counts Brooke Shields and Kate Beckinsale as clients, claims to introduce 'a little bit' more cardio into Ms Aniston's punishing yoga regime, as well as a daily 'energizing 20-minute yoga flow' to get the heart pumping.

In a separate interview with People, Ms Ingber remarked: 'If you do vinyasa flows, it’s actually one of the best things you can do for your arms because you are doing multiple push-ups. That's the reason Jennifer has tone.'

It's clearly not a one-sided client-instructor relationship for Ms Aniston and Ms Ingber. The yoga teacher admits that Ms Aniston - a 'hydrator from way back in the day' - is one to frequently 'encourage' Ms Ingber to drink plenty of water.

Ms Ingber has reaped the benefits of Ms Aniston's hydration advice. She claims to have 'so much' more energy when she drinks enough water, and is often less hungry too.

Of Ms Aniston's all-important diet, which Ms Ingber claims accounts for '80 per cent' of her slim physique, Ms Ingber advocates 'leaning' towards plants for protein, rather than meat, and has said previously that she keeps the carbs low.

focus a little more on, she just tightens it up a little bit. She won't 
have the extra chips'

In a recent interview for Yahoo Beauty with make-up artist Bobbi Brown, Ms Aniston, who stands at five-foot-five, admitted that she would 'love to drop five pounds' and that her most 'comfortable' weight is between '110 to 113lbs.'

But she tries not to take her appearance too seriously, and has also recently spoken out against Hollywood stars - many of them her friends - who aggressively over-use cosmetic surgery.

Her soon-to-be husband agrees. Ms Aniston joked to Ms Brown that Mr Theroux 'will put a gun to my head if I touch my face in any way.'
