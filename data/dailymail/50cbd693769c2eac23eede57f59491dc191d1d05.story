Lionel Messi went through the 400 goal barrier and Neymar scored his first ever league hat-trick for Barcelona as Luis Enrique's team beat Granada 6-0 to stay top of La Liga.

The Argentine is now on 401 career goals for club and country in 524 matches, aged only 27.

Aside from Neymar's treble and Messi's magic there was plenty more to please coach Luis Enrique ahead of Barcelona's trip to Paris to play PSG on Tuesday.

Barcelona have leapfrogged Valencia to go to the top of La Liga after an impressive 6-0 win against Granada. 

Neymar stole the show by scoring his second hat-trick for Barcelona while Lionel Messi, who scored his 400th senior goal, bagged a brace.

Ivan Rakitic, who looked extremely impressive for the home side, also managed to get himself on the scoresheet.

Barcelona go three points clear at the top of La Liga with an emphatic win against Granada. Neymar stole the show by grabbing a hat-trick, while Lionel Messi (x2) and Ivan Rakitic also got themselves on the scoresheet. 

Claudio Bravo is yet to concede a goal for Barcelona since joining the club from Sociedad in the summer. Predictions on how long that will last? 

Neymar and Lionel Messi are simply unstoppable when they are in this kind of form. 86 minutes gone and they are still running riot at the Nou Camp.

Neymar is congratulated by Messi after the Brazilian grabs a hat-trick

Lionel Messi scores his fifth league goal to put his side 6-0 up in the 81st minute. He steals the ball from Babin before lifting the ball over the onrushing Granada goalkeeper.

Neymar will be delighted with his start to the season. Six league goals in five La Liga games is not a bad way to start the campaign.

Barcelona seem to have taken their foot off the pedal slightly now. They will surely have one eye on their upcoming Champions League encounter against PSG.

Neymar grabs his hat-trick by slotting past Roberto. That is the Brazilian's second hat-trick since joining the club from Santos.

Lionel Messi makes it 4-0 after a fantastic move. Xavi plays a long ball to Dani Alves who hits it first time to Messi who has the easy task of nodding home from close range. Easy stuff for the home side.

Luis Enrique has chosen to withdraw Rakitic in order for the midfielder to get some rest before Barcelona's clash against PSG in midweek.

Ivan Rakitic receives a standing ovation by the Nou Camp faithful with Sergi Roberto replacing the Croatian international.

Xavi came close to making it 4-0 with a curling free-kick from 25 yards. Roberto would have been expecting a shot from Messi but the Barcelona veteran surprised everyone by taking the set-piece.

In fact the pair have linked up once again to win a free-kick on the edge of the area...

The likes of Messi and Neymar will enjoy playing ahead of Rakitic during the course of the season. He can score goals as well as set them up for his Barcelona team-mates.

Dani Alves goes on marauding run down the right before playing it to his fellow countryman Neymar. The forward's subsequent shot is blocked leaving the scoreline at 3-0.

Piti and Pascual Eddy are the two players to come on for Granada with Fran Rico and Hector Yuste making way for the duo.

Granada have made a couple of changes to try and get themselves back in the game. Let's see if they can pull at least one goal back...

You can see why a host of sides were interested in signing Rakitic during the summer judging by today's performance. Here's his goal which put Barcelona 2-0 up.

Will Neymar be able to score a third to grab a hat-trick? Stay tuned to our live commentary to see what happens in the second half...

Barcelona will have no pressure in the second half with the three points well and truly in their hands. The scoreline could be anything if Messi and Co. continue to shine.

The home side have surely put the game to bed by scoring two goals in quick succession so late on in the first half.

El Arabi and the brilliantly named Isaac Success causing problems against Barça's defence but then a little Messi magic brings the second goal - Messi's 7th league assist of the season.

Messi is involved again as the Argentine sets up Munir who is brought down by Granada's goalkeeper. Neymar then sweeps up to put his side 3-0 up at half-time.

We told you about Rakitic. The summer signing gets onto a cross by Lionel Messi to nod home from close range.

Down the other end at Granada have a rare opportunity. El Arabi links up with team-mate Success but the latter fails to work Bravo.

Rakitic, playing on the right of Barcelona's midfield three, has been allowed the time and space to dictate play. Could prove to be a bad move by Granada...

Granada are camped in their own half as Barcelona are dictating play in midfield. Can they grab another before half-time though? 

Neymar wheels away in celebration with Barcelona team-mate Lionel Messi.

The 22-year-old's grabbed his fourth goal of the season against Granada. How many more will he score tonight?

With Xavi, Rakitic and Busquets in midfield Barça don't need any help with the killer pass. Granada's Yuste played Neymar in perfectly there for Barca's first goal

The Barcelona forward gets a lucky deflection off Granada defender Babin which ends up in the ball looping over the head of the helpess Roberto.

Neymar puts his side in the lead.

Xavi sends a powerful shot towards Roberto's goal but his effort goes straight into the goalkeeper's hands.

El Arabi fashions a chance for himself by running at Barcelona's defence but fails to work Braavo. Neymar then races up the other end but his cross is deflected away for a corner.

Ivan Rakitic has shown some nice early touches for Barcelona. Looks to have settled into life at the Catalan giants with minimum ease.

Seems to be quite a slow pace at the Nou Camp. Messi tries to inject some life into the game but cannot get a shot off on at goal.

Barcelona go close as Granada's El Arabi slips inside the area however the home team fail to capitalise on his early mistake. Still 0-0.

The first five matches have flown by without any real chances of note. Barcelona look lively in possession but are yet to break down Granada's defence.

Granada are wearing their blue strip while Barcelona are in their traditional blue and red strip.

Granada gets the game under way by kicking off at the Nou Camp

Barcelona's La Liga rivals won 2-0 earlier in the day which will surely put pressure on Luis Enrique's side - even at this early stage. 

Luka Modric and Cristiano Ronaldo netted for Real Madrid against Malaga

Messi and Co will wear a slightly different shirt in honour of the club's museum. 

Lionel Messi, of course, starts for Barcelona in a three-pronged attack with Munir and Neymar. The Argentine has scored three league goals for the Catalan giants so far this season.

Barcelona XI: Bravo, Alves, Mathieu, Mascherano, Adriano, Xavi, Busquets, Rakitic, Munir, Messi, Neymar

Granada XI: Roberto, Nyom, Ba bin, Murillo, Foulquier, Iturra, Yuste, Fran Rico, Javi Marquez, Success, El Arabi.

Barcelona will be hoping to get back to winning ways after only managing to claim a point against Malaga on Wednesday. 

Can the likes of Messi and Neymar inspire their side to victory at the Nou Camp?
