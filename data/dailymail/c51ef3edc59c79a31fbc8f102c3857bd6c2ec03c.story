Whatever the Duchess of Cambridge wears turns to gold.

From a cornflower blue dress from Zara to a pair of vibrant pink jeans, her wardrobe choices have sent high street sales soaring with shoppers desperate to emulate her impeccable style.

But it seems that not everyone is reaping the rewards of the 'Kate effect', with designer Roland Mouret admitting that Kim Kardashian has more selling power than the Duchess.

Battle of the fashion queens: While the Duchess of Cambridge is known for boosting sales, Roland Mouret maintains that Kim Kardashian has better selling power. Both beauties have worn his creations, as seen here

Kate wowed the world when she stepped out in one of his show-stopping cream gowns at Claridge's last year, but French designer Mouret said the 30-year-old doesn't boost his sales as much as businesswoman and reality TV star Kim.

'You don’t see hundreds of women running 
around looking like her [Kate Middleton],' he said.

'To be honest, we’re 
more likely to get orders on a dress that Kim Kardashian’s worn,' he told The Telegraph.

Outspoken: The 'King of the dress' isn't afraid to speak his mind

He attributes this to the fact that the Duchess has no interested in drawing in the attention of the media, unlike Kim Kardashian who lets the media follow her life on a daily basis.

Speaking about Kate's fashion choices, he said: 'She’s highly attuned to those details that will provoke a tabloid frenzy and above all, she does not want a tabloid frenzy,

'She doesn’t seem to feel the need to dress sexily to woo the world.

'She’s dressing for William and herself.'

And it seems that the Duchess is so afraid of the media frenzy that she once asked for one of her gowns to be altered to fit less tightly.

'She doesn’t want a bottom situation like Pippa had,' said Mouret.

Roland Mouret earned himself the much coveted title of 'King of the dress' after his Galaxy dress was named the ‘dress 
of the decade’ and worn by every A-lister in tinsel town.

But after a few years out of the glare of the spotlight,
Roland Mouret is back and ready to give his own iconic number a run for
its money with a brand new collection - no doubt hoping for the endorsement of both Kim Kardashian and the Duchess of Cambridge.
