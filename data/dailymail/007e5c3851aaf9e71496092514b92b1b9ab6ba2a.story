Hundreds of people from a mostly white neighborhood have gathered to support an African-American's family whose home was firebombed in a suspected hate crime. 

Ronald and Malissia Clinton have chosen to stay in their Manhattan Beach, California, home after being inundated with support from the local community.

Members of the all came together for a vigil on Friday night as Ronald insisted the attack was racially-motivated.  

The couple believe there is no other reason for the random act  - where a gasoline-filled tire was set alight, blowing out the front of their house at 2.30am - other than the fact they're black.

'When it happens to one of us, it happens to us all,' Clinton said at the vigil -causing the crowd to erupt in cheers.

Victim Ronald Clinton (left), pictured with his family, said he was amazed at the turnout for the service

He said they had initially blamed the community. However their attitude changed when they saw the overwhelming amount of support.

Mr Clinton added: 'I have to admit, initially, we considered it, but you know, this community is just too amazing for us to let one individual force us to leave.'  

After the fire, Mr Clinton told My Fox LA: 'I don't have proof, I don't have any type of motive, but I do have a gut,'. 

'And I tell you- my gut tells me this was racially motivated.

'And it was somebody that had the intent to harm, injure or even kill us.' 

Damage: The firebomb caused $200,000 worth of damage to the $3.5 million Manhattan Beach Home

Young and old: Families were among those who held up candles to show their support for the family who have decide to stay in the community 

Justice: After the vigil in the city Manhattan Beach Mayor Wayne Powell said: 'This is not what our community is all about and we're going to get the person who did this' 

Adding to The Daily Breeze, Mr Clinton said: 'I just know there is no other reason to target us.

'We have no enemies. Why us?' 

Manhattan Beach's population is 84 percent white. 

Mr Clinton, a pharmacist, was sleep when the attack occurred.

He said he woke to the sound of at least two explosions. His wife, a corporate lawyer, was away on business.

He quickly got his three children up, grabbed the family dog and ran outside. He then used a garden hose to douse the flames at the front of the house until firefighters arrived to finish the job. 

Fire: A firebomb went off out front of the home about 2.30am Wednesday
