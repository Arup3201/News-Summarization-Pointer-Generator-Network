It's been quite the week for Harry Kane. After his first call-up to the England squad, he scored his first Premier League hat-trick in Tottenham's thrilling 4-3 win over Leicester on Saturday.

The treble took Kane's goal tally for the season to 29 and, with 19 of those coming in the league, he has soared above Diego Costa and Sergio Aguero to top the English scoring charts.

The 21-year-old's record compares very favourably with his striking colleagues across Europe too, with Kane now fourth on the list of goal-grabbers in the top five leagues.

Taking only league goals into account, Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi leads the way with 32 goals in 27 matches - that equates to a remarkable ratio of a goal every 74.5 minutes.

However, Cristiano Ronaldo trumps Messi on those measures, with a minutes per goal ratio of 71.4 minutes and an average of 1.25 goals per game. He has, though, scored just the 30 goals.

The only other player to have scored more league goals than Kane is Lyon's Alexandre Lacazette, with 23 in 26 matches.

Kane now has a superior minutes per goal ratio to both Costa at Chelsea and Aguero at Manchester City. He is also outperforming Barcelona's Brazilian superstar Neymar and PSG's hero Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who both have 17 league goals this term.

Alan Shearer says the uncapped striker should start for England in their upcoming games

Former England striker Alan Shearer has backed Kane to make an impression in the England team, starting with this Friday's Euro 2016 qualifier with Lithuania and the friendly with Italy on March 31.

Shearer said on Match of the Day: 'Well considering he didn't start playing regular Premier league football until November he is now top scorer in the league with 19 goals. I think Roy Hodgson should start him. Yes, he's in the squad but start him in the team.

'He's (Hodgson's) watched him enough times this season, he knows what he is all about an he is on fire.

'The form he is in, I think get him in there and he will score goals. He will be a great foil for [Wayne] Rooney and I am a big fan of his.'
