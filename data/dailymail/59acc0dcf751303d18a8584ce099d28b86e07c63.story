Life on Mars doesn't seem so alien now that a team of scientists have set up a Martian camp in a U.S. desert.

A team of experts have recreated life on the red planet by dressing up in space suits and living in isolation on a rocky desert in Utah.

The researchers from the Mars Society live at a simulated base, surviving on food rations, conducting research experiments and showering just once every three days.

Mars comes to Earth: A team of enthusiastic scientists are dressing in space suits and recreating life on Mars - in a red desert on Earth

Every time the team of four men and two women leave the Mars Desert Research Station they pass through an air lock.

The cramped, two-storey hut is situated 40 miles from Hanksville, with the crew sleeping in small, coffin-like beds.

The surrounding area slightly resembles geological and environmental conditions on Mars, in that it is hot, windy, largely red, and rocky.

A British student was recently shortlisted for the job of repopulating the human race - on Mars.

Ryan MacDonald, 20, beat more than 200,000 hopefuls to reach the final stages of selection for a one-way mission.

The contest was part of the 'Mars One' project to establish a self-sustaining colony.

It would see four people - two men and two women - take a five year flight into space.

Mr MacDonald is now on the shortlist to join the first programme on Mars - which is 57 million miles away from Earth.

The Mars One project was founded by Dutch entrepreneurs Bas Lansdorp and Arno Wielders, and aims to establish a permanent base on the planet by 2025.

An initial appeal for volunteers last year gathered more than 200,000 responses.

Contact with the outside world is strictly limited, with a very slow internet connection restricted to allow just a few emails in and out each day.

Most communication is with 'mission control', who ask the crew for reports on every aspect of their lives during their two-week shifts.

That includes details on their food intake, exercise, and psychological status.

Visitors have to travel to the MDRS on a buggy, down an unmarked path littered with boulders, at a speed of just 5mph.

Mission commander Lara Vimercati, 27, who works as a Nasa biologist, said: 'We have to go through an airlock procedure and suit up before we have any contact with the outside.

'Everything we do each day must be as if we were on another planet.

'I'd like to be the first person to set foot on Mars but the first people up there will be engineers. You need to be able to fix things as they break.

'But I am a trained biologist, so maybe I'll be the first person to discover life on Mars.'

The rest of the crew are all from science backgrounds, and realise two weeks at the base does not guarantee them a space on the first flight.

One crew member said: 'In a way, it's great fun.

'You're miles from anywhere and you get to put on space suits and pretend you're on a different planet. Who wouldn't enjoy that?

'It's like a childhood dream come true.'

The suits worn by the scientists come with their own air-conditioning, radio units, heavy helmets, and boots.

Scientists predict it will be 20 years before humans set foot on the planet, and those at the MDRS hope to be on that flight.

They estimate the cost of the initial Mars landing to be £3.67billion, and every subsequent manned mission £2.45billion.

Any crew that survives the journey will have to remain there for at least a year and a half, waiting for Mars and Earth to align properly for the trip back.

During this time, they will supply their own oxygen, power, food, and water.

The experiments being conducted at the MDRS and a sister station in the Arctic are designed to help scientists learn more about what astronauts would endure on such a trip.

The shortest possible journey to Mars is 140 million miles, a trip that is thought to take around seven months.
