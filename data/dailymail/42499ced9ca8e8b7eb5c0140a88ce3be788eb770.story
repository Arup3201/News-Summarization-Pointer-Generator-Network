Barack Obama and former president George W Bush found common ground in Africa on Tuesday, honoring the victims of a terrorist attack in an unprecedented chance encounter a world away from home.

The US presidents had a brief, silent appearance together at a monument to victims of the 1998 embassy bombing in the Tanzanian city of Dar es Salaam, where Bush coincidentally happened to be as Obama wrapped up a weeklong tour of the continent.

While the two U.S. leaders didn't say anything publicly, their wives engaged in a warm and chatty joint appearance at a summit on African women.

Initially the two presidents weren't even planning to meet while in town, but first lady Michelle Obama joked as she sat next to her predecessor: 'They're learning from us.'

United in remembrance: The two presidents bowed their heads at the large stone memorial to the Tanzanian victims of the simultaneous attacks at the U.S. embassies here and in Kenya masterminded by Osama bin Laden

Meet and greet: After a few moments, they shook hands with survivors of the attack and relatives of those killed before walking back into the embassy together in private discussion

Public schedule: Former President Bush joined President Obama in Tanzania in early July as they were both in the African country for different events and paid tribute at the site of the 1998 embassy bombing

The Obamas departed Africa for home shortly after crossing paths with the Bushes, who were hosting the summit promoting the role of African first ladies in bringing change to their countries.

Bush ended up joining the current president for the wreath-laying ceremony honoring the Tanzanian victims of the simultaneous attacks at the US embassies there and in Kenya masterminded by Osama bin Laden.

The two presidents bowed their heads as a Marine placed the wreath of red, white and blue flowers in front of the large stone memorial on the grounds of the new U.S. Embassy. After a few moments, they shook hands with survivors of the attack and relatives of those killed before walking back into the embassy together in private discussion.

Devastation: Twelve people were killed and 85 were wounded when suicide bombers in trucks laden with explosives blew themselves up outside the US embassy in Tanzanian city of Dar es Salaam. A simultaneous attack on the embassy in Kenyan capital Nairobi killed 212

At that very moment, their wives were putting on a public display of mutual affection in a discussion moderated by American journalist Cokie Roberts. Mrs. Obama said she wanted to appear with Laura Bush because 'I like this woman.'

Twelve people were killed and 85 were wounded when suicide bombers blew themselves up outside the US embassy in Tanzanian city of Dar es Salaam on August 7 1998.

Trucks laden with between three and 17 tons of explosives were detonated at around 10.30am local time.

Ten minutes later a second, even more devastating attack struck the US embassy in Kenyan capital Nairobi, killing 212 people. 

In Nairobi (pictured), the death toll was far worse because the blast tore down an office block next to the embassy collapsed with students and staff inside.

The vast majority of the victims were locals. Twelve Americans at the US Embassy in Nairobi died.The US. reacted with a series of missile strikes in Sudan and Afghanistan.

In Sudan a pharmaceutical factory was destroyed because it was believed it was being used to produce chemical weapons - but that was found not to be the case.

The bombs were made using TNT, oxygen tanks, gas canisters, ammonium nitrate and sandbags.

Al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden later claimed responsibility for the attack, bringing him to public attention for the first time. He was killed in Pakistan by a team of US Navy SEALS in 2011.

'It's sort of a club, a sorority, I guess,' Mrs. Bush responded.

Their goal was to encourage African first ladies to raise their voices for causes they are passionate about, even if the public is sometimes focused on more trivial matters, the said.

'While people are sorting through our shoes and our hair ...' Mrs. Obama started.

'Whether we have bangs,' Mrs. Bush interjected to laughter. Mrs. Obama expressed surprise that her change in hair style this year would prompt so much media coverage. 'Who would have thought?'

But Mrs. Obama said: 'Eventually people stop looking at our bangs and they start looking at what we are standing in front of.'

'We hope,' Mrs. Bush joked.

While
in Africa, Obama repeatedly has praised Bush for helping save millions 
of lives by funding AIDS treatment.

'I'm looking forward to being able, 
on African soil, to once again thank him on behalf of the American 
people for showing how American generosity and foresight could end up 
making a real difference in people's lives,' Obama said Monday.

But
Obama also said he wants to change the approach the U.S. takes with 
Africa. 'We are looking at a new model that's based not just on aid and 
assistance, but on trade and partnership,' he said.

'Ultimately,
the goal here is for Africa to build Africa for Africans,' Obama said. 
'And our job is to be a partner in that process.'

In that spirit, Obama announced a new 
trade agreement with eastern African nations and a program to bring more
power to Africans without access to electricity.

One
invention that could help on the electricity front is the SOCCKET ball,
developed by two Harvard graduates.

'I like this woman': At that very moment, their wives were putting on a public display of mutual affection in a discussion moderated by American journalist Cokie Roberts. Mrs Obama said she wanted to appear with Laura Bush because 'I like this woman'

The ball has a pendulum-like 
mechanism inside that creates kinetic energy during play and stores it. 
Its maker says 30 minutes of play can power a simple LED lamp for three 
hours. The plan is to distribute it to kids in Africa.

During
a visit to a local power plant with Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete,
Obama kicked a ball off his foot and did a low header.

'We're
going to start getting these all around Africa,' Obama said at the 
Ubungo Power Plant, which was funded by a U.S grant and built by 
American corporations General Electric and Symbion. 'Pretty impressive 
stuff.'

Obama-radona: Later, Obama demonstrated his 'Soccket Ball' skills with a football that uses kinetic energy to provide power to charge a cell phone or power a light

In remarks afterward, he touted the 'Power Africa' electricity program as a win-win for Africans and U.S. companies.

He
also reflected on the weeklong trip, recalling some of the folks he met
along the way, including a female farmer in Senegal and young people in
Soweto.

'I'm inspired 
because I'm absolutely convinced that with the right approach, Africa 
and its people can unleash a new era of prosperity,' Obama said.
