Brendan Rodgers has challenged Jordan Henderson to score a minimum of 10 goals this season.

Henderson only found the net five times in all competitions last season but did score in Liverpool’s pre-season win over Manchester City on Wednesday.

And Liverpool manager Rodgers says the midfielder has all the qualities to double his tally from last season.

He said: ‘That is the objective for Jordan this year. That finish he made for the equaliser, he does that day in and day out in training.

‘He’s a player that is so fit and so strong. He is such a team player and does so much unselfish for work for the team but this year we are asking him to get more into the box.

‘His strength is that he can really penetrate the defensive line and he is an athlete – he can run all day – so I would expect him to be getting upwards of 10 goals this season because he has the quality and the tactical nose to arrive in the area to do that.’

It was a breakthrough campaign for Henderson last season, who finally established himself at the heart of Liverpool's midfield with a string of fine displays.

And his performances also helped him cement his place alongside Steven Gerrard in England's engine room, appearing in all three group games at the World Cup in Brazil.
