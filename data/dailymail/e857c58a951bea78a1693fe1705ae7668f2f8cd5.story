The October international break is always an ideal time to take a step back and reflect on the state of the Barclays Premier League.

Seven rounds of fixtures have been completed and the table is starting to settle into some kind of shape. Some players have been in scorching form while others are still searching for their rhythm.

So to find out who has been on top of their game, we commissioned the EA Sports Player Performance Index (PPI) - the official player rating index of the Premier League - to pick the best XI of the season so far.

The EA Sports Player Performance Index was created to settle debates about who is the most complete footballer in the Barclays Premier League.

It uses six measures to generate an overall Season Index, which is then used to rank all the players.

The six indices are: Winning performance (players receive more points if their side is winning), Player Performance (points are awarded for shots on target, tackles, saves etc), Appearances (points for minutes on the pitch), Goals, Assists and Clean Sheets.

GK - Thibaut Courtois (Chelsea)

Season Index: 86

The Belgium No 1 has made the transition from La Liga - where he had spent the last three seasons on loan at Atletico Madrid - to the Premier League look effortless. Courtois has made 14 important saves in his seven league appearances to date, helping Chelsea establish a handy early lead at the summit.

DEF - Cesar Azpilicueta (Chelsea)

Season Index: 116

Regular watchers of Chelsea will appreciate that Azpilicueta deserves as many plaudits as Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas and Eden Hazard this season. An absolute bedrock at the back for the league leaders, the Spaniard has won 24 tackles, made 31 clearances and 14 interceptions in his seven appearances so far.

DEF - Branislav Ivanovic (Chelsea)

Season Index: 138

The highest-rated defender on the EA Sports Index, ever-present Ivanovic has been pretty much unbeatable at the back as Chelsea soared to the top. He has shown a strong all-round game, with not only 28 clearances and 18 tackles won, but also 16 crosses and 11 dribbles forward. Ivanovic has also scored twice, against Burnley on the opening weekend and in the 6-3 win over Everton.

DEF - Gary Cahill (Chelsea)

Season Index: 112

Another key ingredient in Chelsea's early season success has been Cahill, who has continued his good form from last season. The England centre half, also an ever-present in the side, has cleared the ball 42 times and made eight blocks.

DEF - Ryan Bertrand (Southampton)

Season Index: 128

Completing the Chelsea flavour at the back is Bertrand, currently out on loan at Southampton. The left back has been integral in the positive run of results that sees the Saints third in the standings. In line with Ronald Koeman's approach, Bertrand has been flying down the wing, attempting 29 crosses in the seven games to date. He also found the net in the 2-1 win over Queens Park Rangers.

MID - Eden Hazard (Chelsea)

Season Index: 188

As he showed on Sunday with that outstanding display against Arsenal, Hazard is a man for the big occasion. The Belgian has been exceptional so far this season and is the highest-rated midfielder in the EA Sports PPI. He has attempted 325 passes in his 595 minutes on the pitch so far, and 296 of these were accurate. Hazard has also contributed two assists and scored twice - against Leicester in the second match of the campaign and that penalty in the London derby last weekend.

MID - Cesc Fabregas (Chelsea)

Season Index: 176

It has been a delight to see Fabregas back in the Premier League with his metronomic passing, but his creativity was the main reason Jose Mourinho moved so swiftly to secure his signature ahead of old club Arsenal in the summer. The Spanish maestro has contributed seven assists so far, more than anyone at Chelsea in the whole of last season, and has accurately completed 511 of 569 attempted.

MID - Gylfi Sigurdsson (Swansea City)

Season Index: 168

The Icelandic midfielder has been given a new lease of life since swapping Tottenham for Swansea over the summer and his all-round contribution has been noted in the PPI. Swansea are fifth in the table, exceeding almost all expectations, and Sigurdsson has had a hand in seven of their 10 goals. He scored on the opening day win at Old Trafford and hasn't looked back.

MID - Raheem Sterling (Liverpool)

Season Index: 172

It may have been a disappointing start to the season for Liverpool but Raheem Sterling is one of the few in the team to be maintaining last season's standards. His direct running style is highlighted by 38 dribbles, while he has successfully completed 172 of 187 passes. Most importantly, Sterling has scored three Premier League goals and added two assists.

FWD - Sergio Aguero (Manchester City)

Season Index: 166

Champions City have been caught out a little by Chelsea's scorching start to the season but Sergio Aguero has been at the forefront of everything good they've done. The Argentine has scored five goals in the league and looked a constant menace when Manuel Pellegrini's team are on the attack.

FWD - Diego Costa (Chelsea)

Season Index: 287

It won't surprise you to learn that Costa stands head and shoulders above everyone else in the PPI. Indeed he is the only one to have surpassed the 200-point mark. Adapting to life in the Premier League with consummate ease and feeling no pressure from his £32m price tag, the Spaniard has nine goals to his credit already, propelling Chelsea to the top.
