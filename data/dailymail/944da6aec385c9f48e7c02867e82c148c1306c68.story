Lionel Messi scored a stunning 90th-minute winner to give Argentina a dramatic victory against Iran.

The 26-year-old netted a sensational 25-yard effort to give his side a 1-0 victory and secure their passage through to the second round.

Messi had huffed and puffed for much of the game, often being surrounded by up to three red shirts every time he got near the ball, but his late big of magic was all that mattered in the end.

In truth, Carlos Queiroz's side can consider themselves incredibly unlucky to finish the game without a point.

The man: Lionel Messi scored a sensational last-minute winner against Iran

Curler: The goal came just as it looked as though Iran were going to steal a deserved point

Unsaveable: Iran's goalkeeper Alireza Haghighi dives in vein but could get nowhere near it

Messi had looked calm and relaxed in the tunnel and during his national anthem, giving off the impression of a man who had had the weight of the world lifted off of his shoulders after that sensational goal at the Maracana last Sunday.

As if Messi needed another ego boost, Iran captain Javad Nekounam tried to get one over on his team-mates by asking for his shirt during the pre-match handshake!

Much like in their opening game, Messi and Argentina really struggled to get going in the first half against Iran.

Alejandro Sabella made two changes from the team that started that game, switching to the personnel and system that began the second half against Bosnia and Herzegovina - the 4-3-3 shape that Messi himself had told his coach he prefers.

Ready and waiting: Messi in the tunnel ready to enter the fray

Tripling up: The Iranian team starved the forward for space from the first minute

But with a
 sea of hardworking Iranians between him and the goal, the Argentine captain struggled 
to sparkle in the early stages, with two or three red shirts immediately
 on top of him the moment the ball came into his feet.

The
 likes of Angel di Maria and Sergio Aguero tried valiantly to stretch 
the game and create space for him, but Iran stood well-organised and firm.Â 

It
 took until the hour mark for Messi to find any space whatsoever, 
turning and charging towards goal from 40 yards out in a style familiar 
to that of his strike against Bosnia, but this time his shot from the 
edge of the area flew wide of the left-hand post.

Frustration: It was a difficult first half for the little Argentine

Opportunity: Messi's best chance in the first half, a free kick, flew over

Left behind: Messi finally finds some space on the hour, but can not take advantage after firing wide

His
 second chance to break the deadlock came from a free-kick on the edge 
of the area just over 10 minutes later, but Messi's curling strike could
 only find the side netting.

And just as it looked as though it 
was going to finish goalless, it was Messi who provided the 
breakthrough, curling in a stunning 25-yard effort to hand Argentina a 
dramatic victory.

It was Messi's second goal of the tournament and ensured his side's passage through to the last 16 of the tournament.

Just inside: The ball found its way just inside the post

Impact: It was not Messi's best game overall, but that's unlikely to matter

Embrace: Captain and his team-mates celebrating after the final whistle
