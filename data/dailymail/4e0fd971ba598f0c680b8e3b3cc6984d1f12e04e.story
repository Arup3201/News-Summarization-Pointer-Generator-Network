A beautiful set of six spectacular willow arches has been unveiled outside Windsor Castle to mark 60 years since the Queen's Coronation.

The six-piece 30ft willow walkway has been created on the Long Walk in Berkshire outside the oldest and largest occupied castle in the world.

A floral archway decorated with 4,000 roses has also been installed near the castle, as part of the walkway which will remain in place until next month.

Willows: The six arches represent each decade the Queen has been on the throne, and they were woven on a local farm before being installed

Joint effort: The RWRHS has worked with the Windsor and Eton Town Partnership and the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead on the project

The display outside the castle - which
has been inhabited for nearly 1,000 years - also features six crowns at
Cambridge Gate, reported BBC News.

The
chairman of the Royal Windsor Rose and Horticultural Society wrote to 
its patron - Queen Elizabeth II - to get permission for the project.

The
society hopes to sell the arches and crowns following the dismantling 
of the display, and proceeds will go its legacy fund for young 
gardeners.

Celebrity gardener Alan Titchmarsh and actress Anna Friel have lent their support to the project and visited it over the past fortnight.

Miss Friel told ITV News: 'I think it's something we can be incredibly proud of. It's changed the perspective of the Long Walk.

The actress, who is honorary vice president of the RWRHS, added: ‘It's already one of the most beautiful places in the world in my eyes.'

The RWRHS worked with the Windsor and Eton Town Partnership and the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead on the project, reported the BBC.

Master weaver Spencer Jenkins told ITV News that he was excited by ‘the size of the structure’ and ‘the opportunity to make something this size’.
