Martin Demichelis and Manchester City didn't appear to be feeling the weight of expectation as the Argentine and his team-mates prepared for their crucial derby clash.

And City manager Manuel Pellegrini underlined the confidence coursing City by claiming that his team ‘expect’ to win the Old Trafford derby on Tuesday night.

For the first time in the modern era, City go to Manchester United as favourites with Pellegrini’s team 12 points ahead of their neighbours with two games in hand.

Asked if it will be a unique occasion
 because City are expected to win at Old Trafford for the third time in a
 row, he said: ‘We also expect to go and win.’

He
 added: ‘Not because Manchester United have had a difficult season we 
are going to go there and win, but if we play a good game tomorrow we 
will have a good chance to win it.’

However,
 Pellegrini played down City’s tag as favourites and insisted that 
maintaining his club’s title challenge is more important than securing 
bragging rights over their neighbours.

He
 added: ‘We know it’s a derby, of course, but for our target we must add
 three points. We don’t just need to win tomorrow and lose the next 
game. We need to be consistent from now until the end of the season.

‘I
 know we must go game by game. We don’t know how many points we must add
 from now until the end of the season. It is important to try to win 
tomorrow and then after Arsenal on Saturday, we will see how many points
 we need.

‘That is why for 
our team all the games have the same importance because they have three 
points, but a derby has a special importance because we know the fans 
enjoy winning against Manchester United.

‘The
 players are very motivated to try and win the title. It has been a very
 close Premier League from the beginning of the season and until the 
last match it will be the same way.

‘One
 of the positive things of being eliminated from other competitions is 
that we are just focusing on the Premier League. We don’t have problem 
physically or mentally, we are just trying to fight for the title.

‘But
 I don’t think we are favourites in any game. That is why football is 
the most popular sport because you never know who will win. There are so
 many things that can change a score that you don’t know about. We are 
in a good moment. Tomorrow we are playing against a big team in their 
own stadium so I don’t think we are favourites.’

Pellegrini’s
 first derby ended in a thumping 4-1 win at the Etihad in September that
 added to the problems David Moyes has encountered as Sir Alex 
Ferguson’s successor.

However,
 the City boss warned that United’s progress to the Champions League 
quarter-finals proves that they are still a force to be reckoned with.

‘It
 will be a very difficult game,’ said Pellegrini. ‘Maybe Manchester 
United have a difficult season but they are a very good team, one of the
 two English teams that stays in Champions League so we must make sure 
we have a very good game if we want to win.

‘It
 is not my duty to analyse what David Moyes has done in his season at 
Manchester United. I think that everyone know it was very difficult for 
him to replace Sir Alex Ferguson but I don’t analyse what he is doing.’

 skipper Vincent Kompany will return from suspension to lead his side

Saturday’s 5-0 win over Fulham through illness.

However, as expected, 
Sergio Aguero and Matija Nastasic have been ruled out through injury.
