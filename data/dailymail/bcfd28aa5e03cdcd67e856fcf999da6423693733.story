Looted treasure: This gold-plated bronze figurine was stolen from a museum in Hama, western Syria

Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria are making millions of pounds selling ancient statues and mosaics to wealthy Westerners using a complex system of smugglers and middle men.

Looted from ancient buildings in ISIS strongholds, such as the group's de facto capital city Raqqa, the antiquities are up to 10,000-years-old and can exchange hands for more than $1 million each.

The most expensive items are covertly smuggled overseas - usually on the orders of wealthy  Europeans - but there is also a lucrative trade in less historically important objects, which often find their way into tourist shops and markets in neighbouring Lebanon and Turkey.

The trade in antiquities is one of ISIS' primary sources of funding, along with oil and ransom payments, and is estimated to fills the terrorists coffers with tens of millions of pounds every year.

The finer points of ISIS trade in antiquities was uncovered in an investigation by the BBC.

It revealed that ISIS militants charge smugglers 20 per cent on the sale of ancient items found or looted in territory under its control. If the smugglers decide not to buy the items, they are promptly smashed to pieces as examples of idolatry, regardless of their historic significance. 

The primary trade routes out of Syria are through neighbouring Turkey and Lebanon, with the homes and private museums owned by wealthy Europeans the eventual destination.

One 21-year-old smuggler originally from the Syrian capital Damascus but now plying his trade in Beirut says the usual method of getting the items over the border is simply to pay a taxi driver already well known to the border guards to carry it in his boot.

Calling himself 'Mohammed', the smuggler says his group do their best to make money selling ancient items such as earrings, rings, small statues and stone heads that were stolen from one of Syria's many looted museums, most of them in and around Aleppo.

However his three-man outfit are positively small time compared to the large organised crime groups dealing with antiquities worth millions of pounds. 

These groups have the financial clout and connections to smuggle their items to Europe without arousing the suspicions of the authorities who mete out severe punishments to smugglers.

Once the antiquities are outside Syria, they are generally passed on to middle men with connections to art collectors, usually in Europe of Gulf states such as Qatar or Dubai.

Ahmed, a Syrian operating as a go-between in southern Turkey, claims to have recently sold a single item for $1.1 million. 'It was a piece from the year 8500BC,' he told the BBC.

The middle men usually agree prices with dealers who observe the stolen items on Skype or by photographs sent online. In another sign of the organised criminal element behind the trade, the dealers then send their own teams to inspect and collect the items before the money is paid.

The dealers are then able to use their contacts among wealthy art lovers to ensure the ancient items are found a new home, many of them private collections and secret museums of Europeans.

Less valuable items - often still over 1,000 years old - typically find their way in to the back rooms of tourist shops in Beirut and southern Turkey, where those in the know ask to see what's on offer.

Smuggling the products out of the country is the purchasers responsibility however, and the choice is between paying extortionate fees to have the items posted to an anonymous address in the West, or otherwise risk imprisonment by carrying the items on to planes and buses on their person.

Making them rich: The trade in antiquities is one of ISIS' primary sources of funding, along with oil and ransom payments, and is estimated to fills the terrorists coffers with tens of millions of pounds every year

ISIS is believed to generate a total of several million pounds a day, with approximately £400,000 of that coming from the sale of oil.

A further £250,00 comes from extortion and protection money paid by companies and individuals operating in areas under its control, while ISIS also makes money from farming, water services and electricity production.

Revenue obtained from ransoms paid by the families or governments of kidnapped individuals in less easy to calculate, but the price for release is usually millions of pounds.

Companies and lorry drivers are forced to pay road and import taxes to use roads in areas under ISIS' control - with lorries charged £500 per journey, plus a further £250 tax for electronic good and £200 for food parcels.

However one expected source of income is the looting of antiques from the many ancient religious sites in areas under its command.

For example, one Iraqi intelligence official claimed that ISIS earned £23 million in early 2014 alone by selling 800 items stolen from the ancient city of Al-Nabk near Damascus.
