An Ohio man convicted in the killing of a woman, who was set on fire and left to die on the road, has escaped the death penalty after a jury recommended life in prison without parole.

The same jury that found LaFonse Dixon Jr. guilty in the August 2012 death of Celeste Fronsman on Tuesday recommended life in prison for him instead of execution.

In trying to spare the life of the 34-year-old Dixon, his attorneys told jurors of his troubled upbringing. He'll be sentenced Nov. 4.

Horrific end: Celeste Fronsman, pictured after two separate arrests, was found by an unnamed truck driver naked and covered in burns

Monica Jean Washington, 24, and Katrina Marie Culberson, 20, pleaded guilty in the case to avoid the death penalty.

They testified that the trio took 29-year-old Fronsman to rural Muskingum County, where she was set on fire and abandoned.

Dixon's attorneys argued the Canton, Ohio, man wasn't involved.

D. Dixon Jr. pleaded not guilty to aggravated murder, kidnapping, 
aggravated arson and conspiracy charges in September in Muskingum County
court.

On Aug. 26, a 
driver found Celeste Fronsman laying by a road near Zanesville in 
eastern Ohio appearing so badly burned the motorist didn't even know if 
she was human.

Fronsman had been raped and burned over 80 per cent of her body while found wearing a strap around her neck.

She died two days later at a Columbus hospital having suffered second, third and fourth degree burns.

Dixon's attorney said her client said he didn't do it and wasn't there.

Two women, Monica Jean Washington, 24, and Katrina Marie Culberson, 20, also have pleaded not guilty to aggravated murder, kidnapping and aggravated arson charges.

Katrina Marie Culberson, 20, and Monica Jean Washington, 24, were eligible for the death penalty if convicted.

Police have yet to explain why they believe these three people were involved or what, if any, relation they have to the victim.

'It's just too sensitive a case right now to divulge any information,' Muskingum County Sheriff Matt Lutz told The Columbus Dispatch.

The only facts known about the three suspects is that they- as well as the victim- have a long list of prior offenses.

Culberson,
who was the first to be arrested, has at least six prior charges to her
name in the last two years. Those charges include soliciting for 
prostitution, theft and burglary.

In the prostitution case, Culberson pleaded no contest and was sentenced to two months in jail.

As for the newly-arrested suspects, Washington was arrested twice for disorderly conduct, and Dixon has drug possession, felony endangerment of children.

Police records received by MailOnline show that Ms Fronsman had an extensive criminal history, including a rap sheet with 25 arrests over the past nine years.

Since 2003, she was arrested for a plethora of crimes including prostitution, drug possession and five counts of domestic violence.

Her most recent arrest occurred on May 28 for having drug paraphernalia.

Her sister, Sarah Gulosh, told the Zanesville Times Recorder that despite her trouble with the law, Fronsman was a loving mother and a good sister and never failed to tell her grandparents how much she loved them.

'She was a good person,' she said, adding that Fronsman had a heart of gold.

Gulosh said her sister was left tortured by the death of her Two-year-old daughter, Jordyn, in 2005, and the death of her mother in 2009.

'We always told her she needed to stop what she was doing and ask God for forgiveness,' Gulosh said. 'But she loved God, and she told us she had asked him for forgiveness.'

Evidence: Empty gasoline containers were removed from the scene by investigators

Her father told the Columbus Dispatch that he last saw his daughter when she and a friend borrowed his truck, promising to return shortly.

The father, whose name has not been released, said that he contacted authorities that morning.

'This is a vicious animal. They ought to be taken off the street and put away,' he said.

The sheriff agreed, and the investigation continues as crime scene examiners were seen removing empty gas containers from the dumpsite.

'This is one of the most gruesome things I have ever seen in 23 and a half years in law enforcement,' Mr Lutz said.

'I can't imagine the pain that this lady went through.'
