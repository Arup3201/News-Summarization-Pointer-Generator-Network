Jaguar is making a bold leap into the future – and the unknown - by launching its first ever 4X4.

The sporty ‘crossover’ from the luxury British car company best known for its high-performance  sports-cars and luxury limousines is to be unveiled as a prototype at next month’s Frankfurt motor Show before rolling off UK production lines in 2016 priced from around £30,000.

Early details of what is set to become a firm favourite with school-run mums are revealed today in the latest edition of the respected Autocar, the world’s longest running motoring magazine.

It coincided with Jaguar Land Rover announcing a 25 per cent jump in profits to £415m.

The five-door crossover will be aimed at younger and more affluent families with children. One insider said: 'You rarely see one of today’s Jaguar models with a child-seat in the back. The crossover will tap into that market.'

Feedback from  top secret and anonymous ‘customer clinics’ held in the Midlands has been very encouraging with one participant describing the new car as ‘stunning’.

Aggressive product development plans: Jaguar is also planning a new 'baby' saloon car (pictured) and a range of small fuel-efficient coupes from £20,000 to follow in the wake of its new F-Type sports car

Based on eye-witness accounts, Autocar has recreated how the new car will look.

Jaguar bosses say it is part of their ‘aggressive product development plans’.

F-Type sports car.

Autocar Editor Jim Holder said: ‘Jaguar always promised us that the F-Type was just the start of an all-out revolution. Now we have the living proof.

'With a red-blooded sports car at the
 heart of its range, Jaguar clearly feels the time is right to expand 
rapidly and aggressively – and how. That the firm is taking a crossover 
to the Frankfurt motor show is the ultimate display of confidence.’

He
 said of Jaguar Land Rover, which is owned by India’s TATA group: ‘The 
investment has been immense. Jaguar’s ambitious growth plan requires it 
to be a success. Failure is not an option.

'These are pressurised times at Jaguar. But how great to see the firm approaching them with such a confident swagger.’

Experts believe the new car will be built at Land Rover’s factory in Solihull rather than at Jaguar’s plant at Castle Bromwich in Birmingham.

The news comes as Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has reported increased profits for the first part of the financial year. The Coventry-based company's pre-tax profits for April-June totalled £415million - a 25per cent  rise on the April-June 2012 period.

Revenues rose 13per cent to just under £4.1billion while retail sales were up 10per cent to 94,719.UK sales rose 13per cent, while Asia Pacific was up 37per cent, China up 11per cent, North America up 10per cent and Europe up 3per cent.

JLR chief executive Ralf Speth said: ‘The result for the first quarter demonstrates that our full range of new and upgraded products is exciting our customers.’

It marks a bumper week for the British car industry. New car sales have raced ahead again, according to official figures.

A total of 162,228 new cars were registered in July 2013 - a 12.7% rise on the July 2012 figure, said the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).

This was the 17th successive monthly increase and took the year-so-far total to 1,325,851 - a 10.3per cent increase on the January-July 2012 figure. The strong sales in recent months has meant the SMMT has revised upwards its year-end figure for 2013. The society now expects annual sales to reach just under 2.22 million.

This would be 8per cent up on the 2012 total and the best annual figure since 2007.

Meanwhile the new generation Mini will be launched in Oxford later this year - on an auspicious day in UK motoring history.

Mini
 owner BMW has chosen the launch date of November 18, which is the 107th
 anniversary of the birth of the Mini's founding father Sir Alexander 
Issigonis. BMW's Cowley plant in Oxford will host the world premiere of 
the new car, with a party in London that evening.

The
 car will then be displayed that week at the Los Angeles and Tokyo motor
 shows, with the vehicle going on sale in the UK early next year.

Small, nippy and affordable, the original Mini was a sensation when it first went on sale in 1959 just as many households, hitherto predominantly carless, were thinking of splashing out on a vehicle.

It was seen as the first 'classless car' and remained hugely popular for decades.

After taking over the Rover car company from British Aerospace in 1994, BMW started making the new, bigger, Mini at Oxford in 2001 and the car has continued to catch the public's imagination with around 50,000 a year sold in the UK.
