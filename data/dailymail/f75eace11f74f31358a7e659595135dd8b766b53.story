After days and repeated refusals from city officials, Jose Reyes has officially been identified as the Sparks Middle School shooter.

The seventh grader who was 12-years-old, allegedly opened fire with a 9-millimeter Ruger semiautomatic pistol and shot three people in Nevada on Monday and one of the victims, Michael Landsberry died.

Reyes also died in the shooting spree after turning his gun on himself and authorities in the city had claimed their much-questioned desision to not release the name was to protect his family's privacy.

Sparks City Attorney Chet Adams released the boy’s name Thursday after the Reno Gazette-Journal announced its plans to file a lawsuit.

Multiple students at the school had already told the the Reno Review-Journal on Monday and Tuesday that Reyes was the shooter, but the newspaper refused to report the name lacking official confirmation.

However, authorities were fighting a losing battle as the young shooters identity was already widely known amongst Sparks' 90,000 residents and was being circulated widely on social media.

'It's obvious that the name's out there,' Sparks Mayor Geno Martini acknowledged before the name was released.

'But our obligation legally is not to release the name because there's an ongoing investigation.'

City officials later acknowledged a report from the Univision affiliate 
in Reno that disclosed the name and said they would release it publicly 
to be fair to families and other media outlets.

In a news release, Sparks spokesman Adam Mayberry said the name of the seventh-grader was released in 'order to be fair to all the families involved and all the news media.'

But he said Adams’s acknowledgement of a Univision Spanish language news story on the shooting earlier Thursday was 'misinterpreted' by reporters.

Adams was not identifying Reyes as the suspected shooter, according to Mayberry. But once that story was out and picked up by other media, the decision was made to identify the shooter.

On Wednesday, Adams had cited state laws that he said prevented him from releasing the shooter’s identity because the investigation was continuing and because the suspect was a juvenile.

But Barry Smith, the executive director of the Nevada Press Association, maintained releasing Reyes’ identity would not have any effect on an investigation.

He said all media sought was the name of a dead person, and there is no law preventing the release of the name of someone who dies.

Then on Thursday, the Gazette-Journal announced it would file a lawsuit against Sparks if the shooter’s identity was not released. A few hours later, the name came out.

School Superintendent Pedro Martinez said in an extensive mass email to all district parents that school officials are reaching out to provide counseling and other services. Parents were encouraged to do the same.

'It is difficult to imagine something of this nature happening in our own community and impacting us so closely,” Martinez said.

'We know we will be feeling many emotions as we struggle to understand and cope with this incident,' he wrote.

Landsberry, 45, was an ex-Marine who coached basketball and soccer and was known as a big fan of Batman.

In his email, Martinez outlined a variety of resources available to families, including a crisis call center and the Northern Nevada Mental Health Services.

It was sent Wednesday night while hundreds of students and others gathered at a candlelight vigil outside the school, where community leaders and clergy offered prayers and words of encouragement.

Spanish Springs Presbyterian Church Pastor Howard Dotson led students in a pledge to 'be a peacemaker.'

'There is nothing glorious or sexy about guns,' they repeated after him. 'I want to learn and grow old and have many children.'

Meanwhile, the mother of one of the wounded boys told reporters she’s committed to helping promote gun safety in the community, and her son said he used to think of guns as a toy, but not anymore.

Jenifer Davis said it’s a 'miracle' that her 12-year-old son, Mason Kamerer, survived the shooting.

'As a result of this incident, I will be getting involved with issues around gun safety in the hopes of preventing this kind of situation in the future,' said Davis, who said she has owned guns and always kept them locked but will be even more proactive in the future.

Kamerer told CNN he heard what sounded like distant gunfire then spotted Landsberry lying motionless on the ground before he found himself within 10 to 20 feet of the shooter, who said nothing before firing a single shot.
