Alleged beach killer Christopher Chittock was spotted with scratches on his face after his wannabe glamour model girlfriend's body was pulled naked out of the sea, a court heard today.

A British holidaymaker sharing their Gran Canaria apartment complex said he saw ‘fight’ marks on the engineer's chin and eye 24 hours after he had spotted a woman's body floating in the water from his room.

Nicholas Atkinson told Chittock's murder trial he saw the engineer eating alone without girlfriend of eight-months Sarah Shields the day after the gruesome July 7, 2010 discovery.

He said: ‘I was sat about a metre away
from him in the restaurant at the apartments and clearly saw nail 
scratches on the left side of his face by his chin and another mark on 
his eye.

‘It looked to me as if he had been a fight. It was the day after the body that turned out to be Sarah's was found.

‘I'd seen the body floating in the sea near our apartment the previous morning after being woken up by my girlfriend.

‘It was moving from right to left in 
the water. At first I thought I saw the legs moving but then realized it
was just the waves.’

Divorced dad-of-one Chittock, 38, is 
accused of beating and strangling work colleague Sarah, 23, on July 6 
2010 during their first sunshine holiday together after discovering she 
had been exchanging texts with an ex-boyfriend.

On trial: Chris Chittock, 38, sitting next to his translator in court today on the Spanish holiday island of Gran Canaria accused of murdering Sarah Shields

He allegedly burnt her belongings on a
bonfire near their apartment except a mobile phone state prosecutors 
say he texted Sarah's friends and family from pretending to be her in a 
desperate bid to cover up his crime.

He was arrested three days after 
returning alone to their home in Ipswich, Suffolk, at the end of their 
two-week holiday in the popular tourist resort of Mogan.

Chittock denies murder and claims he 
last saw Sarah, a Katie Price fan who dreamed of becoming a lingerie 
model, when she left him for a mystery man called Jason she met on 
holiday the week before she was found dead.

Her ex-boyfriend William Newham told 
the jury of four men and five women trying Chittock at Las Palmas 
Provincial Court he had exchanged intimate text messages with Sarah 
after they split in 2007.

She sent him one message from Gran 
Canaria telling him she was sunbathing topless to which he replied: ‘I 
wouldn't mind seeing you.’

The court was told another she sent 
while she was still alive read: ‘It would be good if you were here. It's
not the same with Chris,’.

Mr Newham said a message he received 
from Sarah's phone the day after she was found dead when Chittock was 
allegedly sending her friends and family fake texts, read: ‘Leave me 
alone, I'm happy now, I've moved on.’

Fighting back tears, he told the court: ‘I thought the way the text message was worded was odd.

‘The grammar and spelling didn't seem like the normal message Sarah would send.

‘I subsequently took a call from 
Sarah's brother Paul asking me if I had seen her because she hadn't 
returned home from her holiday.

‘I found out she had died when I spoke to a British police officer.’

'I'm going to miss my dog': It is alleged that Chittock burned Miss Shields's belongings but kept her phone to message her friends and family pretending she was not coming back to Ipswich

The jury was shown pictures of blood 
later identified as Sarah's on large stones Chittock allegedly smashed 
her head on after breaking her nose with a flurry of punches.

Traces of blood containing Sarah's and Chittock's DNA were found on a mattress in their room during a police search.

A local CID chief, who was not named 
in court, said the defendant was arrested in Britain after they had 
identified Sarah's body using a DNA sample sent to them by her mum 
Angela.

He said: ‘The British police told us 
there was an important traffic of messages from Sarah's phone to friends
and relatives' phones after she died.

‘They told us they'd established from tests that a number of those messages had been sent from the defendant and Sarah's home.’

Chittock, who is facing up to 25 years in jail if convicted, denies Sarah's murder.

The trial continues.
