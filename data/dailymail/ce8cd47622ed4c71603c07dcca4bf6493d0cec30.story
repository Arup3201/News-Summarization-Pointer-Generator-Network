Children are reaching puberty five years earlier than a century ago as obesity interrupts hormonal changes in the body, a study has found.

The onset of puberty in girls was 14.6 years in 1920, compared to 10.5 in 2010, researchers have found.

While in boys, sexual maturity consistently occurred around a year later than their female peers.

The scientists behind the study at Plymouth University found the childhood obesity epidemic could be to blame as weight gain causes harmful changes to a child's hormone levels, allowing puberty to happen earlier.

A new study has found a link between obesity and  the declining age of puberty, especially in girls

Past studies have suggested early puberty could increase a child's chance of suffering cancer and other serious health problems later in life.

The team studied hormone levels in 347 schoolchildren aged five to 15 years old.

They
 found a child who is heavier at five tends to have lower levels of a 
protein called sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and reaches puberty 
sooner.

The tendency was more striking in girls than boys, the team noted.

The study focused on the role of SHBG, in children.

SHBG binds to the sex hormones androgen and oestrogen and while levels are initially high in childhood, they decline significantly before puberty, to allow sexual maturity to happen.

Researchers have suggested that hormonal disturbances associated with weight gain - combined with inflammation - could be the biological mechanism that explains the link between obesity and the declining age of puberty.

Lead researcher, Professor 
Jonathan Pinkney, at Plymouth 
University Peninsula Schools of Medicine and Dentistry, said: 'There are
 critical windows early in life which the die is cast for our long term 
health.

Scientists found hormonal changes and inflammation as a result of being overweight affect levels of a protein SHBG, causing puberty earlier

'We
 know that weight gain often begins early and we wanted to investigate 
how early weight gain might be linked to earlier puberty.

'Here we have found compelling evidence that hormonal effects of
 obesity, and associated inflammation, affect levels of SHBG and hence 
the age when puberty commences.

'As
 a higher proportion of youngsters around the world have become obese, the age of puberty dropped. We now know that the relation between
 these issues is more than coincidental.

'These findings have significant implications for children’s development and public health around the world.

'Reduction
 in the age of puberty, as a result of early weight gain, expedites 
physical and psychosocial development at a younger age, and this 
potentially means an earlier ability to reproduce as well as poorer long
 term adult health.

'The observed effects on puberty are another reason to take action against childhood obesity.'

The findings also open a debate about the role of the worldwide obesity epidemic in the general lowering of the age of puberty.

The
 World Health Organization recognises childhood obesity as one of the 
most serious global health challenges for the 21st century.

Figures from
 the UK’s National Child Measurement Programme 2012/13 show that almost a
 third of 10 to 11 year olds and more than a fifth of four to five year olds 
were either obese or overweight.

Worryingly,
 as well as now identified as contributing to the lowering age of 
puberty, obesity in childhood also increases the risk of heart disease 
and diabetes in later life.

The study was published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism.
