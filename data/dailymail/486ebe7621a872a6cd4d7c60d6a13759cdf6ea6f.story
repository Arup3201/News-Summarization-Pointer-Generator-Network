These pictures show the full glory of the British countryside in autumn, with the leaves of the trees displaying a dazzling mixture of red, brown, green and golden hues.

They were taken near the town of Keswick in Cumbria, just north of Derwent Water, and a short distance from Bassenthwaite Lake, both in the Lake District National Park.

But in the town of Alston, 36 miles northwest of Keswick close to the Cumbrian border, heavy snowfall this weekend left the area covered in a thick blanket of snow covering hills, fields and solitary houses.

Around three inches of snow covered the Cumbrian fells as well as areas of County Durham yesterday, causing chilly temperatures and chaos on the road.

Snow ploughs cleared the roads and gritters were out in force as drivers battled to manoeuvre through the snow.

At the Hartside Cafe in Hartside, near Alston, Cumbria, outside tables and chairs were covered thick in snow.

Gloria Clarkson, 50, a general assistant at the Hartside Cafe, struggled to sweep the snow away from the cafe.

She said: 'There is quite a bit of snow here, it's over your feet!

'I saw a car with snow on the roof on my way to work and I said, 'Oh my goodness', I was shocked. Then it started to snow again.'

'Cars were having to drive really slowly and I heard a wagon had overturned. This is the first time we have had snow here in Alston since last January or February.

'It is really cold and I think there will be more to come.'

Tonight will be chilly with clear spells and patchy mist for a time across eastern parts of England and Scotland at the start of the night but cloud and rain across Northern Ireland, Wales and south-west England will spread east across most places over the course of the night.

Some heavy bursts of rain are expected across western and northern areas. Easternmost counties of England are expected to stay largely dry with some patchy frost forming although cloud will build before dawn. It will also be very windy across northern and western Scotland and exposed areas in the north-east.

Tomorrow rain will continue to spread east and south during the day bringing some further heavy outbreaks in places, becoming drier behind the rain as it clears with the chance of some bright or sunny spells for a time, especially in the north and west. Scotland may see some strong south-westerly winds.

On Tuesday, any lingering rain across south-east England will clear to leave much of England and Wales dry and bright but rather chilly. Scotland and Northern Ireland will see scattered showers in mainly western areas that may fall as hail in north-west Scotland.

It will be drier across eastern Scotland with only the odd shower getting across. Strong or even gale force winds are expected across northern Scotland.

On Wednesday, it will be another largely dry day for much of England and Wales with some sunny spells. Showery rain will spread in from the north-west across parts of Northern Ireland and Scotland as the day continues bringing the risk of some heavy bursts with hail and thunder expected in western Scotland. These showers will gradually make their way across north-west England and north Wales as the evening progresses.
