Stress: Ex-MP Claire Ward says the former tabloid may have contributed to her loss

Former Labour MP Claire Ward claims the News of the World may have contributed to the loss of her baby because of the stress it caused after ‘threatening’ to publish a story about her.

The politician, one of the original Blair’s babes, says she received a call from the newspaper in December 2004, the same time that private investigator Glenn Mulcaire was trying to access her voicemail.

She was pregnant at the time and holidaying over the new year with her husband in Latvia, she said in a submission to the Leveson inquiry.

The 40-year-old ex-MP does not say what the paper threatened to publish but said ‘this stress while we were away had an impact on my health.

‘I was under enormous stress from this threat. Following the general election in May 2005, my baby was stillborn.

‘I cannot help but think that the stress I was placed under in the early stages of my pregnancy, particularly during my stay in Riga, may have contributed to the eventual loss of my baby.’

The former MP for Watford said she believed newspapers have a right to hold politicians to account but that she suffered ‘intense and repeated interest’ in her personal life.

In 2001 she says she failed to stop the 
News of the World publishing a story about her and a Royal Marine dubbed
‘Captain Hunk’ during a fact-finding trip to Kosovo even though she 
told a reporter it was complete nonsense.

Ms Ward said: ’He told me that the News of the World intended to run a story that I had behaved inappropriately with a captain in the Royal Marines during a trip to Kosovo.

‘The journalist said he intended to run a story that I had shared a bed and shower with a captain in the Royal Marines and that I had had a long term relationship with him.’

The ex-MP, who has already been awarded damages for phone-hacking from News Group Newspapers, told the reporter it was ‘all complete nonsense.’

She said she was only 28 at the time but the experience left her fearing calls from Sunday newspapers.

‘I anticipated further Friday phone calls and the sense of relief when a Sunday deadline had passed.'
