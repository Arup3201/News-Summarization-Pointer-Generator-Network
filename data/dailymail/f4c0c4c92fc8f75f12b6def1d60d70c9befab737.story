The polo-playing millionaire who killed a 23-year-old in a drunken hit-and-run has been jailed after trying to take off his ankle monitor while on house arrest.

John Goodman, 48, was sentenced to 16 years in prison but has been allowed to remain at his luxury Florida mansion while his case is appealed, after he posted a $7million bond.

He reportedly tried to break device off his ankle with a hand mirror but a police officer, who is at Goodman's house around the clock, was alerted in 35 seconds.

Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw told Gossipextra.com: 'Thereâ€™s no doubt he tried to open it... These devices are rugged and sophisticated. He did not accidentally bump it up.'

Goodman was arrested coming out of the bathroom at his home in Wellington. He was sent to Palm Beach County 
jail late shortly before midnight on Wednesday where is being held pending a hearing. No charges have been filed.

Scott Wilson, 23, drowned when Goodman rammed his Bentley into the student's car and sent it into a canal in February 2010.

Judge Jeffrey Colbath condemned Goodman's actions, saying: 'He left to try and save himself.'

The killer became notorious when he 
tried to adopt his 42-year-old girlfriend in an apparent attempt to 
protect his fortune from his victim's family in the event of a possible 
civil suit over Mr Wilson's death.

In April, he reached a settlement with the Wilson family and will pay out $46million in compensation to them.

Victim: Student Scott Wilson was only 23 years old when he was killed in the car crash

Goodman faced up to 30 years in prison after being found guilty of DUI manslaughter and vehicular homicide.

Prosecutors sought a sentence of 20 
years. The judge ruled that the culprit should be 
imprisoned for 16 years during a hearing in West Palm Beach, Florida.

According to the Sun-Sentinel, the 
judge said: 'These are horrible, horrible cases from a criminal justice 
standpoint.

'Scott Wilson's death was senseless. He was on the eve of 
fullness of life.'

He added that the tragic case should serve as a warning to others as he said: 'Find a cab, find a friend. Don't drink and drive.

'This was a senseless, senseless accident because Mr Goodman chose to drive when he was too drunk.'

According to Mr Colbath, the severity
of the sentence reflected the fact that Goodman knew what he was doing 
when the fled the scene of the accident without calling 911.

'To avoid the liability, the criminal
responsibility, that he knew was going to visit him from the time of 
the crash, he wilfully left the scene of the crash,' the judge said. 'It was because he wanted to figure out a way to save himself.'

Mr Wilson's mother Lili addressed the court, giving emotional testimony about her son.

'Sunday is going to be Mother's Day and Scott will not be coming home,' she said. 'By dying at such a young age, he 
will never get the opportunity to work as a professional after 
graduating from engineering school. He will never have the opportunity to marry and have a family of his own.'

Goodman also took the stand, saying: 
'I just wanted to say that from the day after the accident, all I've 
wanted to do is reach out to the Wilsons and be with them and cry with 
them.

'And I can't imagine or even pretend to imagine what it would be like to lose a son.'

Earlier the judge dismissed a final 
plea from the defense to overturn the sentence on the basis of an 
admission by one of the jurors that he had deliberately got drunk to 
test the effects of drinking as much as Goodman had on the night of the 
crash.

Mr Colbath agreed that the juror's 
actions did constitute misconduct, but ruled that they had not 
influenced the other jurors or affected the eventual verdict.

The case gained national attention after Goodman, 
the founder of the International Polo Club Palm Beach in Florida, 
adopted his 42-year-old girlfriend Heather Hutchins
last October, entitling her to up to a third of his biological 
children's trust fund, worth $300million.

At the time the Wilsons' lawyers slammed the move as an attempt by Goodman to shield his assets.

Prosecutors successfully claimed that
Goodman was drunk when he rammed his black Bentley convertible into 
Mr Wilson's car two years ago, causing it to roll into a canal.

The millionaire disputed the claims and argued in court that the crash was the result of a malfunction with his brakes.

Goodman left the scene and waited an 
hour to call 911 while Scott drowned. He gave a dead cell phone battery 
as the reason why he walked away from the crash scene.

After the crash, Goodman's blood alcohol level was measured at .177 per cent, more than twice the legal driving limit.

At trial Goodman said he was sure of 
one thing: he had two shots of tequila and two shots of vodka before the
crash, yet he was not drunk and that he drunk after the crash to 
alleviate his pain.

After leaving a bar, he said his car 
suddenly lurched forward into an intersection 'and I began to apply my 
brakes, and the car did not seem to be stopping as easily as I was used 
to,' he said.

Unable to control the vehicle, it 
slammed into the side of Scott's - even though Goodman said he was not 
aware he had hit another driver so left the scene.

If he had known someone had plunged into the canal, 'I would have done whatever I could have done to help', he claimed.

Goodman then went to a nearby barn where he found a bottle of liquor, the Miami Herald reported.

'I ... drank it to alleviate, 
thinking it would help with my pain,' he said, claiming it was the 
reason his blood alcohol content was more than double the legal driving 
level when his blood was taken three hours after the crash.

Mr Wilson was a University of Central 
Florida graduate and was working as a civil engineer at the time of the 
crash. He had been driving home to Wellington to visit his family when 
Goodman ran a stop sign.
