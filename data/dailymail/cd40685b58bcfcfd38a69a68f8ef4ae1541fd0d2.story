Frank Warren has revealed he has hit a wall of silence in efforts to make a world-title fight between Tyson Fury and Wladimir Klitschko, with Fury all but giving up hope that the bout will happen.

The veteran promoter has written to Klitschko’s representatives to make a fight in March between the Ukrainian world champion and Fury, the mandatory challenger for his WBO world title.

But there has been no reply to the email and Warren confirmed there have been no positive indications that the younger Klitschko will fight Fury.

Tyson Fury, who destroyed Dereck Chisora, may not get his chance to fight Wladimir Klitschko

Frank Warren and Fury were at the Landmark Hotel in London to promote his next fight on February 28

Klitschko is scheduled to fight in March and will then have to fight Fury or vacate the WBO portion of his collection of world titles.

Warren said: ‘We wrote to klitschko’s people, “Why don’t we cut to chase and do the fight in March?” They have not even responded to say “s** off” or “not interested”.

‘I’ve heard nothing at all. The fight will be mandated by the WBO after his next fight. They will then have to sit down with us.’

Should Klitschko vacate it will validate a prediction unbeaten Fury made three years ago.

Warren said he had written to Wladimir Klitschko's representatives but not heard anything back

He extended his record to 23 wins from 23 fights against Dereck Chisora last month and is due to fight again on February 28 at the O2 Arena – a card that will also feature Chris Eubank Jnr.

But his target is Klitschko, though he doesn’t believe the fight will happen.

‘I have said for three years that I don’t think he will ever fight me,’ Fury said. ‘That is my opinion. I can’t see that happening. I would like to fight for the title and take it off him rather than fighting for a vacant title.

‘It is OK (Klitschko) fighting bums, but a guy who can change tempo and style? That is different. I don’t think he is ready for that.’
