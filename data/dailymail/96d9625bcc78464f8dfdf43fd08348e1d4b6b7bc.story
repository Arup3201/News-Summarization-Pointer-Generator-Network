Waiting times for cancer treatment and other operations are at their highest for six years as the crisis in A&E has infected the rest of the health service.

Experts warned that hospitals are now ‘stretched to the limit’ and said the situation is ‘critical’.

Some 13 hospitals across England declared major incidents earlier this month as they were unable to cope with the numbers arriving in A&E.

They were forced to cancel other operations and had to create makeshift emergency wards out of areas normally used for day surgeries or kidney dialysis.

Now a report by health think-tank The King’s Fund has found waiting times for tests and surgeries for non-emergency patients are at their worst level since December 2008.

More than 39,400 people – some 12.5 per cent of patients – waited more than 18 weeks for hospital treatment in November, the latest figures show.

And just 83.5 per cent of cancer patients were treated within 62 days of urgent referral from their GP, when the target is 85 per cent.

This means that 5,500 patients waited longer – also the worst rate for six years. The King’s Fund said the financial squeeze and the pressure caused by overwhelmed A&E units are increasing waiting times even further.

John Appleby, chief economist at the charity, said: ‘While recent attention has focused on the problems faced by A&E units, performance against waiting time targets and other indicators has continued to worsen.

‘With financial problems also endemic among hospitals and staff morale a significant cause for concern, the situation is now critical.’

Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the British Medical Association’s council, said the A&E crisis is ‘directly linked to pressures across the NHS’.

He said: ‘Every part of the system – from general practice, to hospitals, to community care – is struggling to keep up with demand, leaving some patients facing unacceptable delays.’

He added that some patients have operations cancelled even as they are about to be taken to theatre. 

Jamie Reed MP, Labour’s Shadow Health Minister said: ‘The A&E crisis is intensifying and spreading to other parts of the NHS. This is down to the Government’s failure to get a grip on it.'

A Department of Health spokesman said the NHS is ‘busier than ever’ and that it has given almost £1billion this year to pay for more doctors, nurses, beds and treatments.
