A Japanese plant worker has died after 13 tonnes of molten metal was tipped on him

Kazuki Tada, 23, was working beneath a huge bucket containing an alloy that had been heated to around 1,300C at a Nippon Denko plant in southwestern Japan.

The vat which was suspended in mid air, overbalanced, causing the boiling substance to fall on him.

An investigation into the accident is under way, a local police spokesman said today.

Last week, a man died died when a kettle of liquid steel spilled in the melt shop of an industrial plant in Newport, Arkansas.

Michael Myers, 49, of Bald Knob was found dead at the plant. One other person was sent to the hospital to be treated for shock.

In 2001 two firms were fined more than £200,000 after an engineer fell into a vat of molten metal and died.

Father-of-two Allen Wardle, 52, lived for six hours despite suffering 100 per cent burns when he fell into a vat of molten zinc at a factory in Witham, Essex, in 1998.

He had been servicing a crane used to dip objects in the vat, which was heated to 450°C, when he fell more than 20ft through a temporary plywood covering.
