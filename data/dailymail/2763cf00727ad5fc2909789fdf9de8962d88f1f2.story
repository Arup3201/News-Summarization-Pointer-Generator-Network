A run-down shack in inner Sydney with a rotting deck, collapsing walls and disintegrating floorboards sold for almost a million dollars on Saturday.

The property on Edith Street, Leichhardt, was expected to sell for $850,000, but ended up going for $980,000 at auction.

The small cottage has been uninhabited for 20 years and is in a state of very poor repair â€“ the walls that have not disintegrated are covered in graffiti and the house is littered with rubbish.

This house in Leichhardt in inner-Sydney sold for $980,000 on the weekend, despite the fact that it is an unlivable shack

The backyard features the remnants of an outdoor toilet with rubbish strewn about and patches of weeds the only vegetation.

The 278sq metre block is on a quiet and desirable street near Leichhardt's main shopping strip and the Hawthorne canal. The block has DA approved plans for a four bedroom and two bathroom house to be built.

Selling agent Shad Hassen of McGrath Estate Agents Inner West Leichhardt said he was surprised that the house had sold for such a high price.

The house has not been lived in for 20 years. The floors, walls and ceilings have disintegrated

The Leichhardt home is in a quiet and desirable block, close to shops, cafes and a new light rail stop

The million-dollar property is going to be pulled down and a new house built on the block by the new owners

'It's a timber shack, it basically needs a bit of attention, it's not liveable at the moment, it's got holes in the walls, holes in the floors,' he said.

'I think it's an opportunity for people to build something they'd like,' said Mr Hassen who added that most people who were bidding for the home were keen to renovate and sell.

He added that despite its condition, he is not surprised that people were so eager to purchase land in Leichhardt, where properties regularly sell for over a million dollars.

'It's in a great spot, the area is well-serviced in terms of shops, cafes, restaurants, now with the new light rail the public transport is great,' he said.

The ceiling, walls and floor are disintegrating and the backyard features the remains of an outhouse and weeds
