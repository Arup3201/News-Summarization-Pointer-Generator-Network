An NHS boss has lost the fight for half of the £500,000 home she spent two years doing up to share with her boyfriend, only for him to dump her four months later.

Lorna Gibson, 37, claimed that Dr William Knottenbelt recruited her and her family to renovate his dilapidated three-bedroom home - only to end their relationship months after he moved in.

Together with her retired father Frank and her uncle she had given up her weekends to help transform the 'scruffy' house in South Harrow, Central London county court heard.

Two months after the couple split, solicitors for Miss Gibson, her father, and her uncle wrote to Dr Knottenbelt demanding £67,500 to cover the two men's labour costs.

Miss Gibson, an operations manager at Chelsea and Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, had expected to move in and tie the knot with the lecturer, but was heartbroken when he ended the relationship on 'grounds of incompatibility'.

Judge Vivian Chapman QC, dismissing her claim against Dr Knottenbelt said Miss Gibson was clearly 'deeply in love with him' and was 'devastated'.

'She was convinced that she and William were going to get married, live together in the property and have a family'.

'But I am not satisfied that William ever said or did anything which definitely committed him to any of these things'.

The judge said that when the lecturer bought Miss Gibson a ring for Christmas in 2008 she 'asked him whether she might be receiving a ring from the engagement ring selection next year'.

He replied 'maybe', but the judge ruled that this was 'non-committal'.

The pair met in 2005 and soon began a 'close relationship', but they never lived together.

Dr Knottenbelt, 42, a computer science lecturer at Imperial College, completed the purchase of his new home in late December 2006, moving in during the autumn of 2008.

Judge Chapman said the 'heart of the claim' rested on an alleged oral agreement at a dinner party in December 2006 at the home of Miss Gibson's parents in Hampton Hill.

She and her family claimed it was understood that Dr Knottenbelt would buy the couple's new home, but she would have a half-share in return for contributing to extensive renovations and the couple's living expenses.

Her father, Frank Gibson, a retired golfing enthusiast and DIY expert, agreed to take on the bulk of the renovation work and enlisted the help of two relatives, her lawyers claimed.

Miss Gibson's sister Jane agreed with this account and even claimed that the family cat's dislike of Dr William Knottenbelt showed he was of bad character. 

'She even placed significance on a perceived dislike of William by the Gibson family cat as showing that the cat was a perceptive judge of William's bad character,' sad the judge. 

Miss Gibson said she gave up her weekends to help her father as he worked to transform the house, working as a 'builder's mate and clearing up and going to the shop for materials'.

'She now believes that the whole episode was a deceitful scheme by William to get his house renovated by her family without payment,' said Judge Chapman.

Ruling in Dr Knottenbelt's favour, the judge said: 'I find that there was no agreement on 13 December 2006, or at any other time, that Lorna would receive a half share in the property'. 

'I entirely reject the suggestion of Lorna and her family that the whole episode was a deceitful scheme by William to get the property renovated by her family free of charge'. 

The judge said much work had been done by outside contractors, although a 'great deal' was also accomplished by the couple's relatives - particularly Frank Gibson.

Dr Knottenbelt accepted Mr Gibson's 'tremendous' contribution to the two-year-long makeover, pointing out that he had offered to pay him £5,000 for his efforts.

The lecturer accepted that 'DIY was not my forte', but insisted that he had 'project-managed' the work, and more than did his bit.

Mr Gibson said that 'although William and his family helped with the renovation they were inexpert, and that he had to spend time teaching them and remedying their defective work'.

The judge accepted that he had 'undoubtedly' worked hard on the project, but ruled the value of his contribution around £12,000 - far less than the £70,000 claimed. 

After the case Dr Knottenbelt's barrister, Elissa Da Costa-Waldman, said her client was 'happy' at the outcome and was awarded his costs of the five-day hearing.
