As technology slowly but surely takes over our daily lives - it's refreshing to know that good old-fashioned calendars are still a big stocking filler as Aussies continue to purchase more than 2 million every year.

For the year that will be 2015 - the predicted Top 10 calendar list has everything from movies, TV shows, musicians to the out-there themes of Cow Yoga and Ford cars - and even the practical buy of a Mum's Family calendar.

It's no surprise that Game of Thrones is a winner with Aussies downloading the medieval blockbuster more than anyone else across the globe.

Namaste: This calendar depicting cows in various yoga poses is predicted to be one of the top 10 bestselling calendars in 2015 

Swift sales: Could Taylor Swift's 2015 calendar sales rival those of her new album, 1989?

It's no surprise that the Game of Thrones calendar is expected to be a hit amongst Australians, as Aussies download the hit show more than anyone else across the globe

The other TV shows that make the list are the British resurgence of Doctor Who and the American horror series The Walking Dead.

The massive Disney smash hit Frozen was always going to make the list with million of kids obsessed with the animated film.

While one of the most famous bands in the world, The Beatles, might have split up more than 40 years ago - it remains a big seller with Aussies as does the Liverpool Football Club calendar. 

Popular American country pop star Taylor Swift has also made it onto the Top 10 biggest expected calendar buys.  

Calendar Club head buyer Sarah Bartlett said each year there are the classics with a few surprises thrown in the mix.

They may not be on top of the EPL ladder, but Liverpool FC can take comfort in being a predicted calendar hit

Let it go: Frozen's popularity is far from waning, meaning the film's catchy anthem is likely to remain stuck in Australians heads next year as well

Despite the fact The Beatles broke up more than 40 years ago, they still have the honour of being featured in potential bestselling calendar lists

'Last year Underwater Dogs took everyone by surprise – who knew underwater photos of dogs would be one of our biggest sellers. Sugar Skulls was also enormously popular, and we had to re-print the first ever Peppa Pig calendar,' Calendar Club head buyer, Sarah Bartlett said.

'Then there are the perennial favourites. Aboriginal art is always popular. Liverpool FC always outsells other football codes and clubs, even Collingwood, and bands like The Beatles just keep on selling, year after year.'

After 52 years and 13 different incarnations of Dr Who, a 16-month calendar was necessary as the usual 12 months was just not enough

Ms Bartlett said people still enjoy the low-tech nature of the traditional calendar. 

'It acts as a central point for the whole household, covering off holidays, social occasions, birthdays, appointments and more,' she said.

 'With a simple glance, you can see what's happening across the entire month… no need to sync everything or worry about the computer crashing.'

The calendar for the AMC's hit series The Walking Dead is certain to feature plenty of gore
