Olympic medal winner Gracie Gold has accepted a prom invite by a high school student whose video proposal to the figure skater has attracted thousands of views.

Gold, who won a bronze medal in the team event at the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics, had said the elaborate video in which Dyer Pettijohn asked her to the date, had 'melted' her 'heart'.

She then accepted the invitation after the teenager surprised her during an interview with a real-life proposal, saying: 'If it works out, I would love to.'

Olympic figure skater Gracie Gold accepted high school student Dyer Pettijohn's invitation to the prom after his video proposal attracted thousands of views

Dyer Pettijohn posted a video to YouTube in which he asked Gold to go to his prom with him. Pictured is an image taken from the video

Pettijohn posted his video to YouTube on Sunday, in which he tells the 18-year-old how watching her skate had 'made me realise how perfect we are for each other'.

The video, which had gained more than 116,000 views by this morning, features the California high school student in various locations at his home in Malibu, offering reasons why they would be a good match, including the line: 'You're gorgeous, my mom thinks I'm pretty.'

In the next scene, as he is out for a jog in his training vest and shorts, he tells her: 'You're an Olympic athlete, I made varsity.'

Other reasons he gives include the fact they both live at the beach and are blonde. He even makes a brave attempt at looking 'graceful' on the ice.

At the end of the video he tells her: 'This would be the perfect end to my high school career and make my Olympic dreams come true.'

He goes on to say: 'The Olympic judges got it wrong, you're the only Gold I see.'

Gold tweeted a link to the video on Monday, along with the message: 'This melted my heart.'

But she was then surprised when he turned up during an interview on Extra TV at Universal Studios Hollywood on Wednesday

After presenting the Olympic skater with an impressive bouquet of flowers, Pettijohn asked her for a hug before inviting her again to the prom, to which she replied: 'If it works out, I would love to.'

It is not the first time a prom proposal on YouTube has resulted in a success.

Last May Nicole Muxo, 18, asked Miami Heat basketball star Dwayne Wade to accompany her to her prom.

And against the odds, her cheeky request paid off when he arrived to accompany his date to the dance.

She made the video on April 20 asking the shooting guard if he'd take time out of his play-off schedule to accompany her to the Archbishop Coleman Carroll High School prom.

Despite his knee injury and it being a rare night off the court, he decided to surprise her - turning up to the delight of the teen and her senior year.
