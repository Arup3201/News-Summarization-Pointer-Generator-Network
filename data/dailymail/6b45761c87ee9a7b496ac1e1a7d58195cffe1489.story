The first weekend of the new Serie A season might be just a few days away, but Ashley Cole has still found time to explore the historic city of Rome.

The former England left back joined Italian giants Roma on a free transfer earlier this summer and he seems to be enjoying his new surroundings after leaving London for the first time in his career.

Cole, who looks set to start for Rudi Garcia's side against Fiorentina on Saturday, tweeted a picture of himself outside the Colosseum along with the message: 'Nice walk around the Colosseum this afternoon, that place is old!!..loving the #rome #summer lifestyle!!'

Cole will be one of around four million visitors to Rome's most famous building, which is close to 2,000 years old, this year.

Although the 33-year-old appears to be embracing his new life in Italy, that hasn't stopped him keeping up-to-date with his former side Chelsea.

Cole tweeted an image of himself watching Jose Mourinho's side take on Burnley in their opening game of the season, a match which the Blues won 3-1. 

The ex-Arsenal star will turn his attention fully back to Serie A this weekend as he prepares to make his league debut for The Wolves when they take on Vincenzo Montella's side.

He could be joined in the back-four by Greek defender Kostas Manolas, who has arrived from Olympiacos as a replacement for Mehdi Benatia.

The in-demand Moroccan international signed a five-year deal with Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich on Tuesday.
