Nico Rosberg put a brave face on it. ‘Lewis was quicker today, all weekend, really,’ he conceded after his team-mate Hamilton dealt another psychological blow in this season’s title race.

The deficit at the top after Rosberg's failure to finish in Singapore was three points. That became 10 after he struggled with the balance of his Mercedes in the wet in Japan. And he is in danger of seeing Hamilton extend his lead to 17 – perhaps even more – with only three races, after the inaugural Russian Grand Prix, remaining.

While the Briton, who secured his 38th career pole on Saturday, appears to have raised his game, Rosberg has plateaued. He cannot hide from his winless stretch which now stands at five races; it has been 83 long days since he last took to the top step of the rostrum in Germany.

Of course, there have been poles during the interim, in Hungary, Belgium and in Japan. He also would have certainly challenged Hamilton in Singapore after finishing just seven thousandths of a second shy of his team-mate in qualifying. 

Yet his failure to convert any of those pole laps into victories has somewhat thwarted his chances of emulating father Keke and claiming his maiden championship win.

It would be unfair and probably inaccurate, to say that the pressure is getting to the  ice-cool Rosberg. it would be daft, too, to write him off. 

But we should note that Hamilton has challenged for Formula One championships before, in 2007, 2008 and even in 2010. Rosberg hasn’t. Will those experiences benefit Hamilton? Only time will tell. 

But one thing’s for sure, the title momentum is firmly in the Briton's favour and Rosberg must wrestle it back, starting with tomorrow’s race in Sochi, if he want's to win this championship.

It’s been a dark week for all those concerned in Formula One as Jules Bianchi’s life hangs in the balance after his horror crash in Japan.

The paddock has paid tribute to the stricken Frenchman with tributes adorned on crash helmets and cars up and down the pit-lane.

And the FIA showed their support for the 25-year-old with a computer-generated message displayed during  Saturday’s qualifying session.

The message was displayed on the exit of the final corner throughout Saturday's qualifying session 

‘Jules, we are all supporting you’ was displayed on the exit of the final corner on the world feed which is controlled by Formula One Management (FOM).

Rather poignantly an image taken from the side of Rosberg’s Mercedes, showed both the ‘Tout Avec Jules’ sticker on his helmet and 'keep fighting Michael' hashtag, in support of seven-times world champion Schumacher,  on his car.

Saturday also marked the first anniversary of Maria de Villota’s death which came as a consequence of the injuries the Spanish racer sustained in a testing crash at Duxford in 2012.

Russia is hosting its first Formula One grand prix and the ever-impressive Daniil Kvyat gave the home crowd something to cheer when he qualified a staggering fifth.

It was a career best for the rookie, who has enjoyed a week to remember, after he was announced as Sebastian Vettel’s replacement at Red Bull for 2015 ahead of the Japanese Grand Prix. 

The 20-year-old, who became the sport’s youngest points scorer after he finished ninth on his debut in Australia, was a whopping seven tenths quicker than team-mate Jean-Eric Vergne.

Vettel endured another difficult day at the office after he failed to progress to the top-10 shootout for the fourth time this season.

The quadruple world champion, who will join Ferrari to become the highest-paid driver in the sport’s history next season, could manage only 11th.

‘It wasn’t comfortable, so I am glad it looked like that,’ said Vettel when he was told it appeared as though he was battling his Red Bull during both Q1 and Q2.  ‘We were too aggressive and I did not have the grip at the rear I wanted. I am unhappy that we did not get the best out of the car,' a glum Vettel added. 

Kevin Magnussen’s grid penalty for a gearbox change sees Vettel promoted to 10th for tomorrow’s race, but it marks the 10th meeting where he has been out-qualified by Daniel Ricciado this season. He is 54 points behind his team-mate, a three-time winner this season, in the championship.

Hamilton’s pole rounded off a brilliant day for British motor racing in Sochi after Jolyon Palmer was crowned GP2 champion and Dean Stoneman stormed to a lights-to-flag victory in this morning’s GP3 race.

Palmer claimed his fourth win of the season to build an unassailable 66 point lead over Felipe Nasr to become only the second Briton, after Hamilton's triumph in 2006, to win Formula One's feeder series.

Earlier, Stoneman after securing pole,  led from the front before posting the fastest lap of the race. All of this on his debut for the Koiranen team.
