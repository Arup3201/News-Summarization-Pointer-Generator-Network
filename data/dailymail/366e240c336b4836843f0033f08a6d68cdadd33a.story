When Contessa Riggs saw her older brother swim away from their boat that had capsized in the choppy waters off the coast Maryland to get help, she thought he had a 50-50 chance to make to ashore – but he was far less optimistic.   

In a phone interview with MailOnline Saturday afternoon, the 43-year-old Washington DC resident said that her heroic sibling later revealed to her that he thought he only had about 30 per cent chance to reach dry land alive.  

But John Franklin Riggs plowed ahead anyway, believing that it was the only way to save his sister, elderly father, 3-year-old nephew and 9-year-old niece, who were left clinging to the overturned boat in the gathering darkness following a thunderstorm Tuesday.

Survivors: The family, including 3-year-old Conrad (left) and 9-year-old Emily (right), spent more than eight hours bobbing in the jellyfish-infested water

Patriarch: John Riggs, a 70-year-old retired commercial waterman from Salisbury, organized the fishing trip

Ill-fated vessel: The Riggs family headed off on a fish trip aboard their 16-foot Carolina Skiff

After
swimming for about five hours, Mr Riggs was able to climb ashore and 
get help, leading rescuers to his family stranded in the middle of the 
jellyfish-infested Tangier Sound.  

Miss
Riggs said that aside for a few stings and some scrapes and bruises, 
the entire family is doing well as they continue to recover from the 
terrifying ordeal. 

Her 
3-year-old son, Conrad, is still thinking about the accident and had a 
nightmare recently, but the mother said that the toddler is eager to go 
fishing again.

Since 
Tuesday, John Franklin Riggs, 46, has been hailed a hero by national 
media outlets for his bravery, but according to his sister, he doesn’t 
think he had done anything extraordinary.

‘He is a very modest and shy sort of guy,’ she explained. ‘He shakes his head a lot.’

The
Riggs family and Contessa's 9-year-old niece visiting from California 
were out fishing for croaker off Deal Island, Maryland, Tuesday. 

They
were about five hours into their outing and nearly ready to head home 
when a sudden thunderstorm descended on the area, churning the waters in
Tangier Sound.

Their boat was only 16 feet long, and Miss Riggs, who has been fishing in these parts for a decade, immediately knew they were in trouble.

‘We took a wave over the stern, and I saw the water and went and grabbed a life jacket for my niece,’ she recalled.

At
that point, their small vessel may have had a chance to recover if not for the two additional waves that overwhelmed the boat, 
flipping it over. Miss Riggs just had enough time to put a life preserve
over her toddler son. 

Rescued: Emily, 9, was among those saved from a capsized boat

Mortal danger: Contessa Riggs was especially worried about her elderly father (left), who wears a pacemaker, and the young children on board

Man on a mission: John Riggs swam for five and a half hours to shore to raise the alarm and get help

When their boat capsized, Riggs' 
brother and father swam under to get lifejackets for the rest of the 
family, which ultimately has proven to be a life-saving move.

Miss
Riggs was especially concerned for her 70-year-old father, who has a 
pacemaker, and the two young children in their care, so she made sure 
they stayed close to the overturned boat.

The
16-foot-long Carolina Skiff dubbed Bathtub, which belongs to Miss 
Riggs' father, capsized about 2 miles off the coast and then drifted 
about 5 miles in a parallel direction when the tide turned.

At
first, the 43-year-old mother said that the water felt fairly warm and even 
'nice,' with only jellyfish and sea nettles pestering the family. 
But as it grew darker, the stinging critters became the least of their 
worries. 

‘The bigger problem was the cold, and we were just shivering and shivering,’ Contessa Riggs recalled in the interview.

The
area is also a known habitat of the small but aggressive bull sharks, 
but Miss Riggs said she tried not to think of that while bobbing in the 
water.

John
and Contessa Riggs' father, also named John, is a 70-year-old retired commercial 
waterman from Salisbury, Maryland, who organized the fishing trip for 
his children and grandchildren, 3-year-old Conrad Drake, and 9-year-old 
Emily Horn, a fourth-grader visiting from San Francisco.

Near tragedy: The boat overturned two miles from short. After calling 911, John Riggs went on a rescue boat with volunteer firefighters to find his family in the pitch black

As time passed and the temperature of 
the water dropped, Miss Riggs noticed that her young son was dozing off 
and shivering uncontrollably. 

‘At one moment I was terrified he was going to die in
my arms,’ the mother said of little Conrad.

Riggs knew that nobody was going 
to start looking for them until the next day, so she and John decided 
that their best chance for survival was to go out for help.

'John
and I looked at each other and he said, "Should I try it?" I knew he 
was talking about swimming to shore. So I told him to try it. But we had
no idea if he would make it to shore,' she added.

Defiant: Miss Riggs said that her young son Conrad is eager to go back into the water

Ironically,
Contessa said that her brother, who works as a commercial fisherman, 
does not like swimming and is not good at it. Thankfully, the 
46-year-old had a life jacket on, which helped him stay afloat as he 
slowly made his way towards the shore.

But
as minutes turned into hours and the water grew even colder, the mother
became fearful that she would never see John again. To make matters 
worse, Contessa Riggs saw that her elderly father was getting weaker.

‘I started to think there’s going to be a double funeral,’ she said.

After swimming for five hours, the 46-year-old finally made it to dry land.

'John made it to the beach but he was so tired, he could not walk. So he crawled to the nearest house he saw. Luckily they had dogs, which woke the family up. And even luckier for us, that family had the personal number for the fire chief,' Riggs told ABC 2 News station Friday.

While waiting for rescue, Miss Riggs was doing her best to keep everyone's spirits up by being positive. To stop the kids from crying, she would chat with them about the first thing they would like to do the following day and prattle on about trivial things like eating ice cream and watching movies.

When her 9-year-old niece turned fearful, saying that they will never make it home, Miss Riggs would reassure her that help was on the way. 

It was as they were talking that she noticed lights in the horizon.

‘My first thought was, ‘Thank God, they’re going to find us,”’ Riggs recalled Saturday.

Back on dry land: On the boat were Riggs' 
70-year-old father, a 9-year-old niece, Riggs' sister, Contessa Riggs, 
and her 3-year-old son

Initially, however, the first rescue 
boat that made it into the sound did not notice the family in the water 
and overshot them, not realizing that they had drifted from the location
of the capsizing.

‘They did another loop, and that was just devastating,’ she recalled.

The
stranded family tried to attract the attention of the rescuers by 
screaming and waving, but the genies of their boats drowned out their 
desperate cries for help.

Finally,
a Maryland State Police helicopter hovering overhead shone a spotlight 
on the small group of people huddling around the overturned boat, 
guiding the rescuers to them.

'There
were a few storms in the area, and the boat turned upside down,' said 
Sgt. Brian Albert at the Maryland Natural Resources Police. 'Mr. Riggs 
swam to shore. These people are very lucky. No one was injured.'

Firefighters from Deal Island, Mount Vernon and Fairmount in 
Somerset County and Westside in Wicomico County pulled alongside. The 
U.S. Coast Guard also was on the scene, Mr Albert said.

Volunteer firefighters pulled Riggs 
and her family onto a boat but it was only until they were taken to a 
second boat that she was reunited with her brother.

'It was the most amazing feeling. I ran up to John and said, 'You are my hero,' Contessa told ABC after the rescue.

'I'm so grateful to the first 
responders that came and helped us out. I was so happy to see them and I
love all of them. And I am so proud of my family, especially my 
brother. We survived together.'

Speaking
to MailOnline Saturday, Contessa said, ‘we were extremely, extremely 
lucky. It took us hours and hours to get warm again.’

John
Riggs Sr’s boat has since been pulled out of the water and transported 
back to his yard. His daughter said that it is in good condition, but she 
will likely stay away from it – at least this summer.
