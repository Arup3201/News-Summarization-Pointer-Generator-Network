It is a film that has earned worldwide acclaim – capped by being named best picture at this year’s Oscars.

But award-winning artist Maggi Hambling begged to differ, describing 12 Years A Slave as ‘frightfully boring’ and telling an audience of fine art students that she ‘wouldn’t mind a few slaves’ herself.

The comment offended a black  person in the audience and was branded a ‘despicable racist rant’ by an equal rights group.

Controversial: Artist Maggi Hambling, who made a comment described as 'despicably racist' during a talk in Ipswich

The 68-year-old, whose work has been displayed in the National Gallery and Tate, sparked the race row while criticising Oscar-winning film 12 Years a Slave.

She described it as ‘that frightfully boring slave film’ and told the audience at the University Campus Suffolk in Ipswich she had ‘never been so bored’ as she sat through the 134-minute movie.

‘In the end I didn’t care about the f****** slave. Anyway, slaves would be very handy. I wouldn’t mind a few,’ she added.

Anger: Mature student Jason Haye, 36 - who said he was the only black person among 60 people there - is furious the fine art department failed to take any action against the artist

Fury: Mr Haye claims senior figures are scared to act as they don¿t want to lose Miss Hambling¿s support and patronage

Mature
 student Jason Haye, 36, who said he was the only black person among 60 
people there, is furious the university failed to take any action 
against the artist and has demanded an apology.

‘I
 know Maggi Hambling has a reputation for giving forthright opinions but
 her comments about slavery were inappropriate,’ Mr Haye said.

‘It
 was humiliating. I know she was joking about how nice it would be to 
have lackeys running around for her – but she said it in the context of 
the film.’

The third-year student created a protest video, which he posted on YouTube.

But he says staff told him to remove it in case it triggered legal action from the artist.

Outspoken: Hambling described 12 Years A Slave as 'that frightfully boring slave film' and told the audience at the University Campus Suffolk in Ipswich she had 'never been so bored' as she sat through the 134-minute movie

Mr
 Haye was backed by equality group Operation Black Vote, whose director,
 Simon Wooley, described the artist’s remarks as a ‘despicable racist 
rant’ in an open letter to the university.

Hambling,
 who was made a CBE in 2010 for her services to art, is best known for a
 sculpture of Oscar Wilde in central London and the Scallop, a 13ft 
piece on Aldeburgh beach in Suffolk  dedicated to Benjamin Britten.

She refused to comment yesterday, while University Campus Suffolk said it had not received an official complaint.

A
 spokesman added that  provost Richard Lister had met Mr Haye and said 
the university is ‘committed to ensuring that each person is treated 
with dignity, respect and courtesy’.
