Not-so average Joe: Joe Cornell, 52, a homeless recovering meth addict, returned a bag filled with $125,000 in cash after it fell off an armored truck

Joe Cornell, a recovering meth addict living in a Salvation Army rehab center, only had a $1 to his name Wednesday when he came upon a bag of money that fell off an armored truck.

Instead of pocketing the $125,000 that Cornell, of Fresno, California, discovered when he opened the package, the down-on-his luck homeless man did the right thing - and returned all of it.

A day later, Cornell was handsomely rewarded for his honesty when the security company Brinks, whose truck was transporting the misplaced money, gave the homeless man a debit card with $5,000 on it.

'Mr. Cornell did the right thing,' Brinks spokesman Ed Cunningham told The Fresno Bee. 'For that, we are grateful.'

Cornell, 52, a married father of two with four grandchildren, has been staying at a Salvation Army Adult Rehabilitation Center in Fresno while trying to kick his crystal meth habit.

On Wednesday morning, Cornell was watering plants in the yard when he witnessed a Brinks armored vehicle pull over at a red light on Venture Avenue nearby.

Cornell overheard a motorist yell something to the driver of the Brinks truck, but the vehicle took off.

The homeless grandfather walked over to the intersection for a closer look, and that is when he found a deposit bag stuffed with cash, the station KMPH reported.

Even though Cornell had just a single dollar bill in his pocket for lunch that day, his first thought was that the pile of cash that fell into his lap likely belonged to businesses, and that keeping it could hurt innocent workers and their families.

Cornell also had his grandchildren on his mind when he made the decision not to give in to temptation.

‘I thought, “What type of man do I want my grandkids to think I am?”’ Cornell told KMPH. ‘I want them to think I’m a just man that does the right thing and I did the right thing.’

The Salvation Army volunteer then alerted his supervisor, rehab program director Kayo Loveless, that he had found a small fortune and wanted to return it.

‘I went down there carrying the bag like I was Santa Claus,’ Cornell recalled. ‘It was heavy.’

When Cornell told his wife, Virginia, about what happened, the woman wept because she was so proud of her husband.

The family plan to use Mr Cornell’s $5,000 reward from Brinks to pay off their debts.

'This is like a new start for us,' Mrs Cornell said.

Since the story broke earlier this week, people have been stopping by the shelter to give Cornell donations - or simply shake his hand.

The security company also donated $5,000 to the rehabilitation center where Cornell has been staying for the past four months.

Joe Cornell is expected to graduate from the Salvation Army program in July. He said that he is now clean and is looking for a job.

‘Anyone that needs an honest man to hire, we know that he's an honest man,’ said his wife. ‘He just gave back $125,000 that wasn't his.’
