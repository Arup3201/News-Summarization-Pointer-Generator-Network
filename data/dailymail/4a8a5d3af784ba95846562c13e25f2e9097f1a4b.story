Scotland would remain part of a United Kingdom even if it became independent, Alex Salmond declared yesterday.

The SNP leader said the Queen would still be head of state of a politically independent Scotland, meaning it would stay in ‘monarchical union’ with England.

Mr Salmond used the argument to claim it would be confusing if a referendum question asked whether Scotland should leave the United Kingdom – rather than asking if it should become independent.

Some of the Queen's duties for Scotland include judicial matters and the appointment of judges by recommendation

The Scottish first minister made the remarks as a poll in the Scottish Sunday Express found that 51 per cent of voters north of the border want to break away.

In an interview, Mr Salmond said: ‘I think that some of that increase in support for independence is a reaction against the sort of dictatorial line we’ve been getting from some of the pronouncements from Downing Street.

‘I think the Prime Minister would do well to perhaps listen to the voice of the people and try to conduct this debate with a bit more positivity.’

Alex Salmond insists the Queen would remain as Head of State

Last week, Mr Salmond argued that the referendum question should be: ‘Do you want Scotland to be an independent country?’ Critics say this tilts voters towards ‘yes’, and that the question should be more like: ‘Do you want Scotland to leave the United Kingdom?’

But in his interview, Mr Salmond argued that, in effect, the UK would remain intact even if Scotland goes its own way – so that form of question would not be valid.

However, Labour MP for Glasgow  Central, Anas Sarwar, said on Twitter: ‘It  is utterly ridiculous for Salmond to  suggest that we would remain part of the United Kingdom if Scotland was to vote for separation.’

Labour peer Lord Foulkes described keeping ‘the Queen, the pound, the  Scots Guards and EastEnders’ as a ‘funny idea of independence’.
