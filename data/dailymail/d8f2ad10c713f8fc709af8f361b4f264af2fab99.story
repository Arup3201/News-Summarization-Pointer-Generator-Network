The teenager shot dead by police in Melbourne was once a member of a radical Muslim group that was the target of police terrorism raids back in 2012.

Numan Haider was shot after he drew a knife during an arranged meeting with authorities and stabbed two police officers in Melbourne's south-east on Tuesday night. 

The 18-year-old, who  lived in Narre Warren south-east of the CBD, was once associated with the Melbourne-based Islamic fundamentalist group Al-Furqan.

Numan Haider, the teenager shot dead by police in Melbourne, was once a member of a radical Muslim group that was the target of police terrorism raids back in 2012 

The Al-Furqan Islamic Centre in Springvale, which offers lectures and discussions about Islam, confirmed Mr Haider was once a member of their group, the ABC reports.

Secretary of the Islamic Council of Victoria, Ghaith Krayem, said he spoke the centre on Tuesday night following Mr Haider's death.

'They are as distressed as anybody in the community about what occurred. My understanding is that a young man hasn't been with them for quite some time so they had no recent contact with him,' he said.

In September 2012, Victoria Police and the Australian Federal Police raided a number of properties belonging to people connected with the Al-Furqan centre.

Police seized guns, computers and a memory stick containing violent extremist material during the raids. 

A 24-year-old man was arrested as a result and charged with possessing and collecting material in connection with the preparation of a terrorist act.

Many of Melbourne's mainstream Islamic groups considered some individuals associated with the centre to have controversial views, including its Bosnian-Australian leader, Sheikh Harun.

The leader of a Bosnian mosque nearby, Ibrahim Omerdic, told the Age Sheikh Harun had led a group of 'radical followers' away from his mosque to form the Al-Furqan Centre a decade earlier.  

'They radicalised matters regarding women and men. He said Muslims were not allowed to vote,' he said.

The chairman of the Bosnian Islamic Organisation of Australia, Jasmin Bekric, told the Herald Sun he met the centre's founders shortly after the September 11 attacks in the US.

Numan Haider, pictured here in full military dress on his Facebook page, had recently parted ways with the Al-Furqan centre before he died on Tuesday night 

'In 2001, I met with them when they were established, maybe seven to 10 days after the attacks,' he said.

'We had a clash with their ideas and their approach to interpreting Islam, and at the time I strongly condemned their thinking, their dogma.

'They tried to say some things about the United States. We said to them: "You have got to understand America and its government helped Bosnia and the Bosnian people".'

In one of several videos uploaded to YouTube by Al-Furqan in 2012, Sheikh Harun condemned Muslims who was thinking of joining ASIO, the Australian army or police force.

'I hope that none here thinking it is allowed to be soldier in Australian Army without losing your religion and out of Islam,' he said. 

'So I hope none here has any doubt. And I said army, then police, ASIO, AFP - all that nullify the religion of the person.'
