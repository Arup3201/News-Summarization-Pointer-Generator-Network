Despite her adorable appearance, Rieke the one-month-old baby orangutan was tragically rejected by her mother after being born.

But the good news is the lovable baby monkey is on the way to the UK where she will be re-homed at a rescue centre.

Rieke was born on January 12 at Berlin Zoo and soon afterwards it became clear to keepers that the little one was not being accepted by her mother, the 11-year-old Djasinga.

Coming to Britain: Rieke the cute the baby orangutan is set to move in to the Monkey World Ape Rescue Centre in Dorset

In order to make sure she has an upbringing as natural as possible, she is being transported to England and will live at the Monkey World Ape Rescue Centre in Dorset.

The orangutan's keeper Ruben Gralki, 36, said: 'We did everything we could to try and encourage a relationship between the two but several hours after birth it was decided that the baby would be separated from its mother and bottle fed.'

Despite the worries around the relationship with her mother, the baby appears to be thriving and has become a massive hit in German social media.

User Anke Angelka was a typical commentator when she wrote: 'This little girl is sugar-rush cute!'

Tiny: The baby weighed a tiny 1.8 kilograms, normally regarded as small for an orangutan but nevertheless the infant is healthy and strong

While another simply said: 'I. wanna. have. it'.

Rieke is currently being cared for by three different keepers, who feed her with bottles.

Once in Dorset Rieke will have a friend in the five-month old Sumatra orang-utan, Bulu Mata.

'It will be very difficult to give Rieke up after all of our teamwork, but this is the best place for the little orang-utan girl,' said Ruben Gralki, one of her zoo carers. 'We are definitely going to miss her all the same.'

Officials also said that it is most likely Rieke will be transported by car.
