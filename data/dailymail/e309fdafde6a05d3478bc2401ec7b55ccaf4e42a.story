Mathieu Flamini has one regret concerning Cesc Fabregas. It is not that he didn’t return to Arsenal this summer, nor that he will be facing the Gunners in the blue of Chelsea on Sunday afternoon. It is that the two of them never experienced winning a trophy together at Arsenal.

They both grew up at the club. They became and remain great friends. And they are neighbours in north London, living almost next door to each other.

But Flamini remembers great years at Arsenal which ultimately ended up as memories of what might have been.

‘I came here when I was 20 and he was couple of years younger, so it’s been 10 years now,’ says the Frenchman, recalling his first meeting with Fabregas. ‘In that time, we’ve experienced a lot. We were in the Champions League final together in 2006. I’ve been fighting for him for many years.

‘When we were together here we had a great partnership on the pitch. He was more offensive and I was more defensive, working hard for him. (On Sunday) I will probably mark him and that will not be easy first of all because he is a good player but also because he is a friend.’

But those regrets. There was that Champions League final in 2006, where Flamini came on for Fabregas as a substitute when 10-man Arsenal were 1-0 up with 16 minutes to go.

Two late Barcelona goals scuppered what would have been an extraordinary night. Then there was the 2007-08 season, when Arsenal were five points clear at the top of the Premier League in February before a 2-2 draw at Birmingham City in which Eduardo’s horrific broken leg seemed to break their resolve.

Should Fabregas and Flamini have won trophies together?

‘Of course,’ says Flamini. ‘Like I said, when I came back to Arsenal from AC Milan, it was unfinished business, because I always had in my heart, in the back of my mind, the Champions League final of 2006.

‘Then also, in 2008, we were top of the league until late in the season, and we collapsed. We lost one player, a bad injury to Eduardo, so that is a bad memory I keep in the back of my mind.

‘It was difficult, because we lost it easily. In 2008 we had such a strong team and I’m frustrated because of that. I think in my mind I want to clear that up, that’s why I came back to win titles. We started last year, with the FA Cup, and we have big ambition this year.’

It will be hard for Arsenal fans to see Fabregas in blue on Sunday afternoon, especially given the superb start he has made.

‘It will be strange for everybody,’ says Flamini. ‘But it was his decision to go to Chelsea. He’s a good friend of mine so whatever decision he made, I support him. He is a big player.’

For Chelsea, the addition of Fabregas feeding chances to Diego Costa has added a layer of fluency to their attacks which was missing last season.

‘He’s one of the best midfielders in the world,’ says Eden Hazard, another beneficiary of Fabregas’ presence.

‘Diego Costa is right in front of me and it’s very good to play with them. They understand football. It’s easier to play with them. I was happy (when he signed). I play football to play with the best and these are the best players in the world.’

You would imagine Arsenal must now have some regrets, given the option was there to re-sign him.

‘Of course,’ says Hazard. ‘When you can get Fabregas and he goes to another team, you must be frustrated a little bit. But Chelsea are happy.’

Of course, Arsenal have Mesut Ozil, Santi Cazorla, Tomas Rosicky, Aaron Ramsey and Jack Wilshere in central attacking roles. Arsene Wenger’s decision not to pursue Fabregas more determinedly makes perfect logical sense. It is just that emotionally it feels wrong.

Fabregas is likely to play in a more attacking role today, rather than the deeper position he has filled so far.

Jose Mourinho may look to bolster his midfield with a more defensive player than the Spaniard, something Wenger never seems to be prepared to do. 

Chelsea’s 6-0 massacre of Arsenal at Stamford Bridge last March, which came in Wenger’s 1000th game for the club, saw the Arsenal manager start with a midfield of Mikel Arteta, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Santi Cazorla, which proved hopelessly inadequate.

The default excuse for that result is that Kieran Gibbs was sent off (mistakenly, it should have been Oxlade-Chamberlain) after 15 minutes. 

Yet by then it was already 2-0 and the red card was for a hand ball on the line preventing the third goal. The subsequent penalty would make it 3-0. The sending off had represented the end of the contest, not the turning point.

Flamini sat on the bench that day and could only look on, until Wenger brought him on at half time, belatedly acknowledging his error. Flamini says: ‘We collapsed too quickly. After 10 minutes we were already 2-0 down.

‘We have learned from our mistake, we are gaining maturity, we have some quality in the team and we go there with a lot of confidence.’

Wenger surely can’t approach the game with the same tactics which have seen his side swept aside by Chelsea time and time again. 

In the last 10 years, since Mourinho took over at Chelsea for the first time, Arsenal have played their London neighbours 24 times. They have won three, drawn six and lost an incredible 15 times. Wenger has never beaten a Mourinho team.

Flamini believes today can be different. ‘When you go there, and you lose the way we did last year, it’s on your mind,’ he admits. ‘(On Sunday) we go there, we give everything. It’s important for every single one of us but also for the fans. I’m sure they remember what happened last year and we really want to make it up.’

For Hazard, of course, there are only good memories. ‘It was fantastic,’ he says. But the Belgian is also looking beyond the derby. ‘We are first and we hope at the end of the season we can stay there,’ he says. ‘I need a trophy. I came to Chelsea for trophies.’

From Chelsea players such statements about the title ring true; from Arsenal players, much less so. Wenger needs to regain credibility in these big games. 

When the two rivals face each other on Sunday, we will discover whether there has been any real tactical evolution over the summer or whether it is merely ‘plus ca change’, as Wenger might say.
