Tony Fernandes faces legal action by the current 'owners' of Caterham as the Formula One team stand on the brink of going out of business.

Caterham were bought from Malaysian entrepreneur Fernandes at the end of June by a consortium of Swiss and Middle Eastern businessmen, since when the organisation has been forced to deal with numerous difficulties.

Already facing an unlawful dismissal suit by a group of more than 30 staff axed over the summer, on Monday a supply company to the team - Caterham Sports Ltd - was placed in administration.

Crucially, however, the consortium claims AirAsia and QPR owner Fernandes, along with two other former owners of the F1 team, failed to act in good faith with regard to the transfer of shares of ownership.

In essence, the consortium has been running Caterham over the course of the last few months without being the legal owners.

Given the countless issues, they have now decided to withdraw all management from the team and effectively told Fernandes he is again in charge.

Up until Wednesday, Caterham had been preparing as normal for the final three grands prix of the season in the United States, Brazil and Abu Dhabi.

But without management, and with Fernandes unlikely to step back in at such short notice, the team face the prospect of their campaign being brought to a premature end, and worse, folding altogether.

Caterham are in danger of going out of business after a four-year stay on the Formula One grid 

Via a strongly worded statement, the consortium said it is to take all legal recourse against Fernandes and other parties.

The statement read: 'On 29 June 2014, Caterham Enterprises Ltd, Caterham (UK) Ltd and Sheikh Mohamed Nasarudin (Seller) and their shareholders Tony Fernandes and Datuk Kamarudin Bin Meranun entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA) with Engavest SA (Buyer) with regards to 1Malaysia Racing Team Sdn Bhd/Caterham F1 Team.

'Since the date of the agreement, the seller has refused to comply with its legal obligations to transfer their shares to the buyer.

'The buyer has been left in the invidious position of funding the team without having legal title to the team it had bought.

'This is in total contradiction to the seller's press release of 3 October 2014 which stated that Mr Fernandes and his Caterham Group had no longer any connection with the Caterham F1 team.

'The administrators of Caterham Sports Limited have been appointed on behalf of Export-Import Bank of Malaysia Berhad (Exim), a creditor of Mr Fernandes and the Caterham Group. The buyer has no connection with Exim.

'Caterham Sports Ltd was a supplier company to the Caterham F1 team. Very regrettably, the administrators' appointment has had devastating effects on the F1 team's activities.

'Since their appointment, the administrators have released various press statements which have been severely detrimental to the management of the Caterham F1 team.

'After three months of operating the Caterham F1 Team in good faith, the buyer is now forced to explore all its options including the withdrawal of its management team.

'Lawyers have been instructed by the buyer to bring all necessary claims against all parties, including Mr Fernandes who, as an owner, will run the F1 operation.'

Team principal Manfredi Ravetto has confirmed he has been forced to step back from managing the team, as well as insisting Fernandes remains the owner. 

Fernandes later hinted he had yet to be paid for Caterham by the consortium.

After retweeting a question from a follower - 'I wonder what @tonyfernandes has to say.... Could it be he hasn't received payment from the Swiss/Middle Eastern investors? £F1' - he then posted: 'If you buy something you should pay for it. Quite simple.'
