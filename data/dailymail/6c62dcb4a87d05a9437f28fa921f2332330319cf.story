The 29-year-old woman who was escorted off a US Airways flight after her 'emotional support' pig started defecating on the floor and squealing uncontrollably has been identified by MailOnline.

Rachel Boerner, from Wallingford, Connecticut, and her 80-pound pot-bellied pig, Hobey, were removed from the plane  before it left Hartford's Bradley International Airport on Wednesday.

The pair had  already passed several security checks after Miss Boerner explained how her pet offered her emotional support and was travelling with her to her family's home for Thanksgiving.

On Sunday, Victor Kinoian, the owner of My Pet Piggy in Rhode Island, where Miss Boerner bought Hobey seven months ago, said his customer had been left devastated by the airline's actions.

Leaving the plane: The pair had already passed several security checks after Miss Boerner explained how her pet offered her emotional support and was travelling with her to her family's home for Thanksgiving

'She was excited to see her family in South Carolina,' he told MailOnline. 'She's really close to her pig and he is wonderfully trained. The airline had initially welcomed her on-board.

'She took Hobey through the airport on a leash and a harness and told members of security that she used him for emotional support. Hobey hadn't been destructive when they were kicked off.'

Mr Kinoian, whose facility sells pigs to customers across the US, added: 'I think the pig got nervous and went to the bathroom  and that caused many passengers to become alarmed and confused.

'The pilot and stewardesses had to make a quick decision. And although pigs themselves don't smell much, their fecal matter does. The whole thing ruined Rachel's plans for Thanksgiving.'

Pigs can't fly: Miss Boerner, who is pictured leaving the flight on Wednesday, was allowed to take Hobey onto the plane for 'emotional support' based on guidelines released by the Department for Transportation

Miss Boerner, who also owns a smaller pig called Claudette, took to My Pet Piggy's Facebook page earlier this year to express her love for Hobey, writing: 'I feel a bit lost without Hobey with us'.

The devoted owner, believed to be an aspiring actress and model, has also previously referred to the animal as her 'fat baby' and posted photos of her and her boyfriend holding their two pigs.

On Wednesday, Miss Boerner was allowed to take Hobey onto the plane for 'emotional support' based on guidelines released by the Department for Transportation.

However, prior to take-off, the animal reportedly started screaming 'three times louder than a child' as his owner coaxed him down the aisle with her feet because he struggled to move on his own.

'It was ridiculous,' 65-year-old passenger, Rob Phelps, who was with his wife at the time, told MailOnline on Saturday. 'It started to smell and flight attendants told her to clean the mess up.'

Mr Phelps of Havenville, Western Massachusetts, said there was 'instant silence' then 'a mix of uncontrollable laughter and shock' when Hobey boarded the plane.

'I have seen dogs and cats in cages on a plane - but never a pig,' he said. 'This was not a small pig. When she held it over her shoulder it reached her waist.

'I don't even know how it got through. You have the TSA and intense security and yet it still was let on board.' 

Friends: Miss Boerner, who also owns a smaller pig called Claudette (seen with Hobey), took to My Pet Piggy's Facebook page earlier this year to express her love for Hobey, writing: 'I feel a bit lost without Hobey with us'

Prioritizing customers: Mr Kinoian (pictured), who runs My Pet Piggy in Rhode Island, said: 'I think the pig got nervous and went to the bathroom and that caused many passengers to become alarmed and confused'

He added that during the encounter the woman was talking to the animal like a human being, calling it a 'jerk' for not behaving. 

After five or ten minutes, a number of passengers began to complain as the pig got more and more distressed, Mr Phelps said.

Once airline staff realized Hobey's presence on the plane was not going to work, the pig and Miss Boerner were led out of the cabin, a US Airways spokesman said.

Mr Phelps said that the pig was the only thing the rest of the travelers spoke about the rest of the flight, and he was still laughing about it when he sat down for his turkey on Thursday. 

Angry: On Friday, Mr Kinoian posted this message to his Facebook page, describing the incident as 'not cool'

It remains unclear whether Hobey was a registered emotional support animal, or whether Miss Boerner provided airport staff with official documentation explaining his presence.

In 2012 it was revealed that the Department of Transportation had certain guidelines allowing animals, including pot-bellied pigs, could be taken on flights.

Along with monkeys and miniature horses, they could be designated as 'Emotional Support'. 

Transportation officers would have to determine whether the animal is permitted on the plane by running through a list of guidelines. 

Pigs are favored service animals for people allergic to dogs. Guidelines suggest they are intelligent companions and attuned to dangerous situations. 

American Airlines, the parent company of US Airways, said the woman had the pig as an emotional support animal and was asked to leave the plane after it became disruptive.
