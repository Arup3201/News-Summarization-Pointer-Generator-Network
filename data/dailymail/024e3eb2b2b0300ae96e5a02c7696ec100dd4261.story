Retired nurse Nancy Lane, 68, was infected with Hepatitis B after doctors used a dirty throat probe during heart surgery

A retired NHS nurse died after surgeons used a dirty ultrasound throat probe to examine her heart - infecting her with Hepatitis B, an inquest heard yesterday.

Grandmother Nancy Lane, 68, contracted the deadly blood infection from the ultra-sound throat probe known as a 'magic eye' after it was used on another infected patient moments earlier.

The magic eye probe had not been properly sterilised - and Hepatitis B was passed to Mrs Lane.

The inquest ruled former health visitor - who worked for the NHS for more than 30 years - died as a result of inadequate decontamination at Morriston Hospital in Swansea.

Her family yesterday told how they were 'devastated' by her tragic death.

A spokesman said: 'Nancy dedicated herself to the NHS, she worked for the NHS and had total trust in the people and organisation looking after her.

'We feel that she has been completely let down.'

Mother-of-two Mrs Lane was making a good recovery after heart surgery and was 'living life to the full'.

But she was readmitted two months after her operation when health chiefs at Morriston Hospital realised there was a risk from the probe.

Mrs Lane, of Aberdare, South Wales, died of acute liver failure three months after her heart operation.

Following her death a post mortem examination revealed she had contracted hepatitis B, which caused her death.

Dr Bruce Ferguson, medical director for Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board, told the inquest Mrs Lane had received a heart valve replacement.

He said: 'During the operation it is common practice to use a transoesophageal echocardiogram (TOE) probe to monitor the heart.

'The probe was covered in a protective sheath while in use and insepcted and cleaned with a disinfectant wipe after the operation.

'There were no national guidelines outlining the correct decontamination process of the probes at the time of Mrs Lane’s operation in March.'

Coroner Louise Hunt recorded a narrative verdict that Mrs Lane caught hepatitis B because of failures in decontaminating an ultra-sound probe.

Ms Hunt said: 'The likely source of the virus was probably the probe that had not been cleaned enough.

'In my view the changes introduced since the death of Mrs Lane are sufficient to avoid similar incidents in the future.'

The hospital apologised unreservedly to Mrs Lane’s family and friends, admitting it had not provided a high standard of care.

An independent report later made 32 recommendations to improve standards at the 750-bed NHS hospital.

Verdict: A coroner ruled that Mrs Lane died as a result of doctors using a probe that was not cleaned properly during her heart surgery operation at Swansea's Morriston Hospital

But Mrs Lane’s family claim that dirty and even bloody instruments were being used on patients at the hospital two months later.

The spokesman said: 'We were told that the Health Board had made changes following notification of her death in June 2011.

'But in August 2011 when the Review Panel attended the hospital they identified items of equipment reported to be clean and ready for use which were visibly contaminated, often with blood.

'We accept that some changes have been implemented, but we feel that not all the issues behind hospital infections have been addressed such as poor and inadequate training.

'All Health Boards should make sure that staff training, as well as facilities in place, are fit for purpose so that staff can carry out high quality infection control, cleaning and decontamination.'

Mrs Lane’s family has asked the Welsh Government to hold a public inquiry into the management of infection control at the hospital.

Their solicitor Stephen Webber said: “This has been a tragic event for the Lane family and has brought to light serious issues within the NHS.

'The evidence showed that before Mrs Lane’s operation the procedures in place were inadequate, including the cleaning of the probe, training, and the culture as a whole.

'Some changes have been made, but the NHS needs to be vigilant.

'A formal review should take place in 12 months to ensure all changes have been implemented and infection control procedures are safe.'
