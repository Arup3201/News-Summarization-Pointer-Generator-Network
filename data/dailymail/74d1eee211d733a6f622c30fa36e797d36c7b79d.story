A prison guard found guilty of helping smuggle drugs into prison and illegally accessing the information of prisoners under her care has applied to take her six-month-old baby boy to prison with her.

Sarah Dawn Rudd, 26, from Alice Springs in Central Australia, pleaded guilty to a string of charges while she was working as a guard at Berrimah prison in Darwin.

The charges involved a corrupt ring of prisoners, a police officer, and outlaw motorcycle gangs, which traded in the confidential information about prisoners and the supply of drugs.

Rudd and her partner, firefighter Anthony Butt,45, was also involved in the syndicate.

If sentenced to prison, Sarah Dawn Rudd wants to take her baby to do time with her.

Northern Territory Supreme Court Justice Jenny Blokland asked correctional services about the possibility of Rudd's child living with her in the new correctional centre, which is under construction in rural Darwin.

Rudd held the baby in her arms and breastfed while she faced trial last week, according to NT News.

Crown prosecutor David Morters told the court that Corrections boss Ken Middlebrook confirmed women with babies would be accommodated at the new jail.

'The new jail will support the provision of services to young children,' he said.

The former prison guard has pleaded guilty to a dozen of charges after her involvement in a crime ring operating outside of a Darwin prison.

She pleaded guilty to several drug charges, as well as convincing a colleague to illegally access confidential information on other prisoners on the Corrections database.

A pre-sentencing report has been ordered  to see the likelihood that a new correctional facility will be able to house former prison guard Sarah Dawn Rudd and her six-month-old son.

Her partner and co-offender, Anthony Butt, who is a firefighter, supported her in court. The couple were both charged in May last year for possessing steroids from a trip to Thailand.

Her barrister Jon Tippett QC said his client had a hard time working as a guard and began using drugs – before she was arrested with ecstasy pills and 1.5g of the drug ice in her undies during a drug deal at Le Cornu, Winnellie.

The court heard how Ms Rudd told a woman name Zayley Ainslie how to smuggle cannabis past patrolling dogs for her prison boyfriend Phillip Noel Kaye, who was also Ms Rudd's alledged drug dealer.

Ms Rudd had been working at the Darwin Correctional Centre for four years when she was arrested in a police sting, Operation Moonraker, in June last year.

Justice Jenny Blokland said the harm was in compromising the integrity of Corrections, according to NT News.

It is believed that Ms Rudd had committed 12 crimes between March and June 2013.

Crown prosecutor David Morters told the court she used fellow guard Dwayne Reichelt to access confidential information to find out if her alleged drug dealer Mr Kaye who was already arrested when she tried contacting him.

She also passed messages from prisoner Jared Davis, a Rebels bikie, to James Hau, who was arrested with 14 guns that former navy sailor Matthew Evans stole from a patrol boat at Larrakeyah, telling him that Davis wanted him to organise cannabis supply to the prison through Kaye, according to NT News.

She also told Hau what evidence Mr Davis wanted him to give about the firearms.

Prosecutor Morters said Mr Hau had planned to trade the guns to the Rebels in exchange for “dangerous drugs”.

'These offences constitute a serious undermining of the criminal justice system,' prosecutor Morters said.

'It's a significant breach of trust to be participating in the supply of drugs into a correctional facility.'

Barrister Tippett said Justice Jenny Blokland should be lenient in sentencing her because none of the charges resulted in any serious harm.

'She had been a prison officer who had (always) stuck to her ethical and professional responsibilities in the past and along came a period of significant uncertainty (and) emotional upheaval,' he said.

The sentencing case continues.
