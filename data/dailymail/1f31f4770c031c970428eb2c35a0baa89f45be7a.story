President Obama has angered wealthy jet-setting New Yorkers with his travel plans this weekend because much of New York’s airspace will be shut down during his visit to the state.

The timing of the President’s trip to New York's Westchester County today for a series of weekend fundraisers could not have come at a worst time because it will be during the Labor Day weekend.

According to CBS, the Federal Aviation Administration will put the skies over New York City on lock down until Saturday.

Corporate planes and private charters and their jet-setting passengers, will be the hardest hit.

The no-fly zone will last from Friday afternoon and all day Saturday.

But
 it will feel like an eternity for the high-powered Wall Street types who 
regularly depend on small planes to fly them to the playground of the 
rich and famous.

For those people Obama's timing is particularly bad, says the head of one aviation firm.

Melissa Tomkiel, president of the 
private aviation company Fly the Whale said: ‘Several were very upset 
about it and extremely inconvenienced.

'They had plans, you know, several weeks ahead of time to get out to their vacations.’

She told CBS that the company expects to lose at least $10,000 while New York City airspace is shut down.

‘Labor Day in particular is important because it's at the end of the busy season of the summer,’ Tomkiel said.

‘So it's really our last chance to make as much as we can as a company and keep it in reserve for the slower months that are ahead.’

The temporary flight restrictions over New York City will have minimal impact on commercial flights.

Most are already sold out, and are not an option for stranded passengers.

However, on Fridays, as many as six flights an hour take off from a pier on Manhattan's east side.

By plane, a trip to The Hamptons takes just 35 minutes while flights to Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard, where Mr. Obama vacationed earlier this month, last about an hour.

It could leave many wealthy people seeking alternative modes of transport.

By car, a trip to The Hamptons from Manhattan takes about two hours without traffic.

But during one of the busiest holiday weekends in the year that could increase drastically as large numbers of New Yorkers head out of town.

Meanwhile, driving to Nantucket usually takes at least six and a half hours. There are estimates that it could take eight or nine hours in heavy traffic over Labor Day.
