Julia Roberts’ half sister claimed in her suicide note that the actress was so cruel that she ‘drove me into the deepest depression I’ve ever been in’.

MailOnline can reveal that in her final words Nancy Motes described the Oscar-winning star as a 'so-called sibling' who should get nothing if she died - except the memory that she pushed her over the edge.

In the emotional, handwritten note, Nancy said that Roberts’ abuse had been so bad that ‘I burst into tears because I wake up’.

Blame: Julia Roberts step-sister Nancy Motes committed suicide last February. In her final note she wrote, 'I burst into tears every morning b/c (because) I wake up. She was tormented by Julia and called her a b****

Bitter words: Nancy leaves her 'sister' Julia nothing except the memory that she tormented Nancy

Nancy died of a drug overdose overdose on February 9  at the age of 37. Her death was ruled a suicide.

The former production assistant on the TV show Glee drowned in a bath surrounded by a mixture of nonprescription and prescription pills, according to the Los Angeles County Coroner.

Her fiance John Dilbeck and his family are now engaged in a bitter legal battle with Pretty Woman star Roberts and her mother Betty for control of Nancy's estate.

John and his brother Conner say the fight is the latest example of how Roberts tried to manipulate Nancy’s life and control everything.

At the center of the row is a suicide note which was found at the scene of Nancy’s death - which can now be revealed for the first time.

In the note Nancy begins by saying that ‘if anything happens to me’ then John gets ‘whatever he wants of my possessions’ including their dog Lucy.

She writes: ‘My mother and so-called ‘siblings’ get nothing except the memory that they are the ones that drove me into the deepest depression I’ve ever been in.

Class act: At a memorial for Nancy last May, Julia looked grief-stricken. But Nancy claimed in tweets before she died that Julia treated her badly. In one she said: 'Just so you all know, America¿s Sweetheart is a b*****'

‘I have suffered thru this disease all my life, however It has never been this bad.

‘I burst into tears every morning b/c (because) I woke up.’

The note was filed court papers in relation to probate of Nancy’s estate.

It has three sections; one addressed to John, another to her mother Betty and Roberts, and a third addressed to ‘everyone’.

However under California law the Los Angeles County Coroner is only obliged to give the pages to the person to whom they are addressed.

Betty and Roberts, 46, have not added their letters to the court file, so they remain private.

In the section of the note addressed to John, which is in the file, Nancy praises him as her ‘one true love’ and tells him she is unworthy of his affections.

She begs his forgiveness and says she is ‘nothing but a junky’ - who will be ‘better off w/out (without) me’.

Nancy writes: ‘I know this will effect you the most and & I can’t apologize enough.

‘I was truly blessed & lucky to have you as my true love and best friend. I will carry you with me forever.’

Her final words are: ‘And I am so sorry’.

Battle: Although Nancy declared her wishes in this note,  Dilbeck and his family are now engaged in a bitter legal battle with Pretty Woman star  and her mother Betty for control of her estate

The suicide note reflects the ill feeling that Nancy had towards Roberts which she expressed in a number of Tweets before she died.

In one she said: ‘Just so you all know, America’s Sweetheart is a b*****’

Another read: ‘Do you want to be a fan of someone so cruel? She’s not even that good of an actress. Happy you totally f***** me’.

A third angry Tweet read: ‘(M)y own family has abandoned me’.

Motes, originally from Georgia, was the daughter of Roberts’ mother, Betty, 79, and her former stepfather, Michael Motes, 69.

Last month Roberts and Betty both attended the service to bury Nancy in Smyrna, Georgia.

Reports of what happened are contradictory, with one magazine reporting that Roberts was ‘very polite and kind’ during the ceremony, which was attended by family and friends.

However RadarOnline reported that mourners were stunned by her ‘bizarre eulogy’.

Roberts supposedly said: ‘ Nancy’s...Gone and not coming back’, according to a source.

The source added: ‘Julia said that, as her sister, she just wanted to ‘wring’ her neck because she didn’t wait to see the joy that comes with the morning.’

Unwelcome: When Nancy told Julia of her intention to visit their mother Betty in the hospital, Julia reportedly told her:  'Please be gone by 3:30'

Nancy’s relationship with her mother and Roberts had long been rocky but fell apart last year after she sold a story to a newspaper about how her famous sister used to tease her about her weight.

According to RadarOnline, texts apparently sent between Roberts and Nancy in November of  last year relating to their mother’s breast cancer battle underscore just how bad things had become.

One from Roberts reads: ‘If you plan on seeing Mom in the next 2 weeks you should go in the next hour. Thanks.’

Nancy replied: ‘We’re heading to see her now. Thanks’.

In a cold reply, Roberts wrote: ‘Please be gone by 3:30.’

Last straw: Although she professed her eternal love for Dilbeck, Nancy said she couldn't go on

Just over a week later things became tense when Roberts sent her a message trying to take control of when Nancy would visit.

Her message read: ‘We will text you when Mom’s surgery is scheduled’.

Nancy replied: ‘Mom asked me to come to the hospital. I’m coming.’

But Roberts insisted: ‘She is asleep. She has to get an x ray and isn’t even admitted to the hospital yet. She is only allowed 1 person with her.’

The texts were from a preview of a documentary called Now That I Have Your Attention, which is about Nancy’s video diaries.

It was uploaded to YouTube but has now been taken down.
