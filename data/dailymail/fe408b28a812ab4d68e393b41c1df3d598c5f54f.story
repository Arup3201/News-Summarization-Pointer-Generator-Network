Investigators in Saratoga Springs, Utah, broke their silence over what prompted officers to shoot and kill 22-year-old Darrien Hunt outside a fast food restaurant on Wednesday, saying he lunged at them with a sword.

'When the officers made contact with Mr. Hunt, he brandished the sword and lunged toward the officers with the sword, at which time Mr. Hunt was shot,' according to a prepared statement from Utah County Chief Deputy Attorney Tim Taylor.

But an attorney for the man's family questioned that scenario, contending that an autopsy shows Hunt was shot numerous times from behind as he ran away from police, KSL reported.

Saratoga Springs police had been responding to reports of a 'suspicious' man and carrying a 'Samurai-type sword'. 

The police statement came a day after Hunt's mother said her son was shot because he was black. 

'There is currently no indication that race played any role in the confrontation between Mr. Hunt and the police officers,' the statement said. 

But Susan Hunt said she thinks he wouldn't have been shot were her son white. .

'I'm in Saratoga Springs, cause it's a safe little community and they killed him,' Susan Hunt said on Friday. 'They killed my son because he's black. No white boy with a little sword would they shoot while he's running away.'

Susan Hunt said she thinks her 22-year-old son Darrien would never have been shot were he white like her

 Susan Hunt, middle, said Darrien had been going through some tough times emotionally since she left an abusive relationship three years ago

'Would they have done that to any white boy?' she added.

Police say they shot Darrien Nathaniel Hunt, whose father is black and mother is white, on Wednesday while he was carrying what they have described as a Samurai sword. 

'Those stupid cops thought they had to murder over a toy,' Ms Hunt said. 'This is my baby. This is my family. And they ruined my family.'

Officers stand at the scene of the shooting in Saratoga Springs. Police deny Hunt's race had anything to do with the shooting but have declined to provide more details about what prompted officers to shoot him

Friends and family of Hunt's have been leaving flowers, pictures and other objects at a makeshift memorial near where he was killed

'We sympathize with Mr Hunt’s family during this difficult time. Any claim that our officers’ actions were a result of Mr Hunt’s race are completely unfounded and speculative. Our officers responded to a call for service and addressed the situation that was presented to them. The Utah County Attorney’s Office continues to investigate the incident,' according to a statement from the city.

Differing accounts from several eyewitnesses have confounded the confusion over what actually happened. 

Police say Hunt was carrying a Samurai sword but didn't reveal any other details about what prompted officers to shoot him

Most agree he had a three-foot sword, either in his hand or strapped to his back, but some described him as 'distressed', while others said he was 'totally calm', according to media reports.  

Hunt was walking near a cluster of shops, including a Panda Express, a gas station and a credit union. 

One of the witnesses  sent Ms Hunt a photo of police confronting her son outside the bank just before shots were fired. The pictures shows two officers standing on either side of Darrien Hunt, with no sword visible. 

At that point a shot was fired, according to the Hunt family's limited information, and more rang out as Mr Hunt ran toward the Panda Express, and the young man was struck and killed.

'I've been begging the police, why from the time I saw the pictures of you just standing by him with his hands to his side, does he end up seconds later with a bullet in him?' Ms Hunt said. 'And then if he's running, why you had to put in more bullets, and I don't even know how many? That's what I want to know. Would they have done that to any white boy?'

Hunt reportedly ran toward this Panda Express during the confrontation with officers, when he was killed. The memorial was set up on the right side

Ms Hunt said her son was a tender young man who cared about the world and was emotionally confused after her family fled an abusive relationship. The letter at right was affixed to the small memorial at the scene of the incident

She described the sword as a Katana blade purchased at an Asian souvenir shop in the area and unable to cut anything.

Ms Hunt said her son loved everyone and was deeply concerned about the environment and problems plaguing other parts of the world.. A boy in a man's body, Mr Hunt was still coming to terms with life after their family fled an abusive relationship three years ago, she said.

He was born in Salt Lake City, and the family later moved to Kentucky and Virginia before returning to Utah.  

'My son is a tender heart who would not hurt anybody. Just wanted to be loved. And he was so confused. He was abused his whole life,' she said. 'My son is a beautiful, bright-eyed, intelligent boy.'

In January, Hunt took a plea in abeyance to a misdemeanor charge of assault, according to state court records, according to KSL.com. Ms Hunt said he should never have been charged with the incident because he was drunk and venting and only lightly pushed her. He also punched other teenagers in the house who were trying to control him. 

A growing makeshift memorial sprung up in front of the Panda Express on Friday, with balloons, flowers and pictures of Darrien. 

The Hunt family has set up a fund to help pay for funeral expenses. Donations can be made at any America First Credit Union under Darrien Hunt's name.
