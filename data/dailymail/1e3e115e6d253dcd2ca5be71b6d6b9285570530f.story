Why haven’t they been able to defend? Among the many head-scratching aspects of Everton’s season, nothing has baffled more than that particular question.

Ultra-reliable last year, with a record that was third best in the Barclays Premier League, this campaign has been miserable; individual errors, combined with a lack of continuity in personnel and consistency in performance, has led to a hole being blown in Everton’s ambitions.

During a run of four consecutive defeats – their worst sequence since December 2005 – it led some to ask whether Roberto Martinez should pursue a more prosaic approach. If you don’t concede, you don’t get beaten but Everton have conceded too often and been beaten too frequently.

At this point 12 months ago, they had conceded 19 goals; now the tally is 34.

Facing up to one of the most fearsome attacks in Europe, then, you would not have expected much to change but, at long last, we were given a glimpse of those characteristics that have served Everton so well down the years. This was how they should be.

The minimum requirement of an Everton team is to ally prodigious hard work with a refusal to be second best and from the early exchanges in this collision with Manchester City, you could see a return to old fashioned values.

‘I thought it was an old-fashioned game with a lot of character and grit,’ Martinez observed. ‘In the first half, I thought we allowed Manchester City too much space but we defended well. We stopped David Silva and Samir Nasri being effective in the areas they can operate really well.’ 

Martinez wants his defenders to play the ball elegantly out from the back but this crowd also likes to see their defenders doing the basics and in Phil Jagielka and John Stones, Everton had the game’s best pairing at centre-half.

Jagielka has not had a campaign to remember but, with Stones back alongside, this was much more like it. Tackles were made, interceptions were read and orders were barked out, as Everton battled to keep City at arms’ length.

Stones, meanwhile, was outstanding. Had you never watched a game of football before and were brought into Goodison with the task of picking out which defender cost £32million, you would have picked out this young man from Barnsley, not Eliaquim Managala.

If Managala found it all happening too quickly, Stones – who was being watched by England Under-21 head coach Gareth Southgate – exuded calmness, not least when in the first half he took control of a high ball on his chest, turned into space away and started a move with nonchalance.

Most importantly, however, Stones showed he could do the dirty work too. He was the player David Moyes signed as Everton manager two years ago. This performance showed why he could prove to be the perfect parting gift.
