What do you get if you cross a blustery day with a lightweight frock?

Answer: The Duchess of Cambridge giving a passing impression of Marilyn Monroe in The Seven Year Itch.

Kate’s uplifting moment was part of an all-round wizard experience as she visited the set of the Harry Potter films yesterday.

First she won style plaudits for her polka dot dress – a £38 number from Topshop, which was a stark contrast to the £1,065 Erdem design she wore in Manchester on Tuesday.

Then she, and her ever growing bump, successfully took on husband William in a ‘wand duel’.

The couple, accompanied by Prince Harry, were on a visit to the new Warner Bros Studios in Leavesden, Hertfordshire.

Kate and William were invited to take a wand each before being shown a few ‘spell techniques’ and being invited to duel.

Earlier the party, who were accompanied by 500 guests and children associated with the charities they support, had visited another part of the studios where they were shown props from Batman film The Dark Knight Rises.

William and Harry were clearly taken with a camouflaged Batmobile
 known as the Tumbler. William
 turned to his brother and whispered: 'We should borrow that for the 
weekend.'

He then climbed inside and turned on the engine, revving it to
 within an inch of its life.

The Duke joked, 'where's the start 
button?', adding 'it's awesome, absolutely incredible' while his younger
 brother put his fingers beside his head for Batman's ears and said 'you
 need the ears'.

When William finally emerged from the 
Batmobile after a long while he said, 'I'm a very happy man' but when he 
spotted his wife the royal apologised saying, 'sorry, sorry'.

Clearly a fan, the future king then 
couldn't resist climbing on board the Bat Bike and posing for the 
cameras as Harry looked on enviously. Both brothers own their own 
superbikes - but clearly nothing on this level.

Where's the start button? Prince William asked as he was delighted to sit on the 'Bat Bike' from the film The Dark Knight Rises

The three royals also spent time examining Batman's heavy rubber armour.

'Is
 this really what the actor wore, how heavy is it?' William asked. He 
was astonished to discover it took 25 minutes for actor Christian Bale 
to put on.

The royals 
headed over to a 'green screen' where draftsman Ed Symon was seated on 
another model of the Batpod motorbike sited on top of a 'six axis motion
 base.' It was originally built for the broomstick flying in the Potter 
movies.

John Richardson special effects supervisor on the movies, said: 'We've had everyone on it from Harry Potter to Voldemort'.

There,
 William took to the controls of the simulator making the Batpod move up
 and around as if it was flying. William said 'I won't throw him off.' 
Turning to Mr Symon he said 'how much so you trust me?'

Wizard day out: The pregnant Duchess of Cambridge arrived at the Harry Potter film studios in a dress from Topshop

Optical illusion: The royal bump wasn't as 
evident today as it was earlier this week when the Duchess arrived in 
the spotty dress with her bag across her stomach...

...until she turned to the side when her six-month bump became more obvious

Symon replied: 'Completely -- go for it.' 

Kate looked on anxiously and said: 'You're trying to throw him off!'

Afterwards Mr Symon said: 'That was amazing -- it was great fun.'

As it moved this way and that, Kate asked one of the technicians: 'Would they be acting whilst on that?'

Across the hall the trio met Harry Potter author JK Rowling and producer of all eight movies David Heyman. He said of meeting the royals: 'They all asked about the films -- they really like the films.'

He said that Kate was enthusiastic about how the movies attract continue to attract all ages. 'She was saying how the films were very much loved by the younger generations as well.'

In a speech to formally open the 
studios William couldn't resist making a joke at his brother's expense 
saying: 'To be honest, I’m over the moon just to have seen the real 
Batmobile and Batpod – you don’t do baby seats for those cars, do you, 
by any chance?

'On the other hand Harry’s just 
excited to see a real life talking owl in the Harry Potter studios.  I 
haven’t told him yet that Harry Potter is fictional, so please keep the 
secret for a little longer.‬'

He then held up a lifesize clapperboard and said: 'Warner Bros studios Leavesden. Act 1. Take 1.'

The visit will culminate with them 
hosting a most unusual meeting for their Charities Forum in the Great 
Hall, one of the original sets from the Harry Potter film series.

The Charities Forum is a collection of charities, of which The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry are Patrons.

Started in 2006, it provides a platform for collaborative activity between the 35 participating charities and organisations who meet twice a year to discuss ideas and ways to support each other.

During the first part of today's Studio tour, the Duke and Duchess and Prince Harry will also meet some of the creative teams from recent Warner Bros. Productions and be given an insight into the film making process as well as being shown some of the props and costumes from those films.

Warner Bros.’ £100 million facility, the
 first of its kind to be built in the UK in 70 years, accounts for a 
third of the dedicated major feature film production stage space in the 
UK.

It is the only film studio in the country to be owned and operated by a major Hollywood studio.

Formerly
 the production home of all eight Harry Potter films, Goldeneye, Star 
Wars Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace and Tim Burton’s Sleepy Hollow, the 
state-of-the-art studios now encompass nine sound stages, a 100 acre 
back-lot and one of the largest underwater filming tanks in Europe. It 
is available to all kinds of productions, not just Warner Bros., from 
commercials to music videos, TV shows to feature films.

The first production to shoot there 
since the redevelopment was All You Need Is Kill, directed by Doug Liman
 and starring Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt.
