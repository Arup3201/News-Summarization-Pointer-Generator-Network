Defiant: Natasha Massey, 25, has stood by Evans despite his rape conviction and has agreed to marry him after his release from prison last month.

Proposal: Evans is to marry his fiancee Natasha Massey after proposing shortly after he was released from prison, where he served half his five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old girl

Evans was jailed for five years in April 2012 after a jury convicted him of raping a 19-year-old woman at a hotel near Rhyl, North Wales. He was freed after serving half his sentence. 

Evans lost an appeal against his conviction but his fiancée has launched a campaign, bankrolled by her millionaire father, to clear him and the Criminal Cases Review Commission is fast-tracking the case.

He admitted having sex with the teenager, who cannot be named, but insisted she had agreed. However, the court heard that she was too drunk to have consented to sex. 

The former Sheffield United and Wales striker was released from Wymott prison, Lancashire in October.

He then proposed to fiancée Natasha Massey, who has led the campaign to overturn his conviction. 

But his victim, now 22, has had to change her identity twice after being targeted by trolls who named her online, and is now living away from her friends and family. 

Her father has demanded an apology from Evans, but he maintains that he is innocent despite the jury's unanimous guilty verdict. 

His fiancee appeared alongside Evans in a recent video he made, in which he insisted he was guilty only of infidelity - not the rape he was jailed for.

In the video, Evans apologised to Ms Massey, who he described as 'the woman I love with all my heart'.

Couple: It is thought Evans, pictured with Ms Massey before he was convicted, did not want to propose from jail

He said: 'I've constantly regretted my act of infidelity and the damage that has been done on so many fronts because of it.

'The support that's been shown by Natasha, our friends and family during the trial and the time spent in prison has kept me strong.

'It can't have been an easy thing to stand by someone who the court found guilty of such a destructive act. I will be forever grateful' 

It is understood that Evans had not wanted to propose while he was in jail, but planned to asked Ms Massey to marry him as soon as he was freed. 

Ms Massey has continued to protest Evans's innocence since he was convicted of rape in April 2012.  

Support: Ms Massey, pictured on ITV's This Morning, said she has put thoughts of Evans's infidelity 'to one side' but believes he is not capable of rape

Evans had been serving at HMP Wymott prison in Lancashire but was released last month

She told ITV's This Morning: 'As soon as I found out that he'd been questioned over rape, my instinct was kind of protective of Ched, and I thought I have to stand by him.

'So my thoughts and feelings over the cheating were put to one side and I just stepped in to help him through this terrible time.

'I know Ched and I knew he wouldn't be capable of committing a crime like that.'

The Criminal Cases Review Commission is currently examining Evans's case  as part of his hopes to launch an appeal. He has not been re-signed by his former club or any other team since his release.
