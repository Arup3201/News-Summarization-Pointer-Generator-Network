Losing your luggage on a flight could soon be a thing of the past after an airline developed a bag that is impossible to lose.

Aircraft maker Airbus has helped develop technology which could eliminate the problem of missing baggage, a problem that costs the aviation industry nearly £2 billion a year.

According to the latest industry figures, about four pieces of luggage will be lost on the average Boeing 747 flight.

The prototype luggage technology, known as Bag2Go, involves embedding a satellite tracker and bar code display on to the suitcase. Using a smartphone, a passenger sends details of their flight to the airline which in turn sends back a bar code which is shown on the display unit of the case

Passengers are most likely to lose a bag when changing flights - especially if the connection time is short.

One of the major reasons for luggage being lost is when the paper tags carrying the bar code are ripped off as cases are shunted along conveyor belts to the aircraft.

It was this which led to the loss of thousands of bags by British Airways following the chaotic opening of Heathrow’s Terminal 5 in March 2008.

Should your bag be loaded onto the wrong aircraft, the combination of satellite technology and the bar code means that it will be easily traced via the app on your smartphone

The prototype luggage technology, known as Bag2Go, involves embedding a satellite tracker and bar code display on to the suitcase.

Using a smartphone, a passenger sends details of their flight to the airline which in turn sends back a bar code which is shown on the display unit of the case.

Each bar code is unique carrying details of the traveller, flight and destination.

Once on board a plane, a passenger can use a smartphone app to check that their bag is in the hold and alert flight crew if it's not there.

Should the bag be loaded on to the wrong aircraft, the combination of satellite technology and the bar code means that it will be easily traced.

It will enable the case to be re-routed to the correct destination enabling the luggage to be returned to its rightful owner.

The app has a number of functions, including an alert if the bag is tampered with

At the same time, the passenger can keep track of the bag with the help of a mobile phone application.

The app has a number of functions, including alerting a passenger if somebody tries to tamper with the bag.

The technology is still being developed by Airbus, T-Systems - a telecommunications company and RIMOWA, a suitcase manufacturer.

Passengers will be able to buy the bags, although renting them is another possibility being considered.

The
 advanced technology means that there may be no luggage carousels in our
 future at all, as the satellite technology could mean bags are 
transported independently and directly from your house, to the 
airplane's hold, and finally to your hotel.
