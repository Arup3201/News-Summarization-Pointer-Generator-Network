A great-grandmother was left lying on her living room floor for more than seven hours waiting for an ambulance after she fell. 

Beth Sheppard, who is 19 stone and suffers from heart problems, was unable to get up after falling in her own home. 

Her daughter Joy, 38, dialled the ambulance trust's non-emergency line to ask for a lifting team to assist her 78-year-old mother. 

But when the family was told that no one from the community health team was available to attend their home in Bristol  and they would have to wait for a first responder to be dispatched from 999.

More than five hours later, no one had arrived.

Joy said: 'I told the caller I thought this was appalling service and that my mother was now in pain.

'They kept telling me not to feed her or give her a drink, only a sip of water, which was impossible as she was on floor.'

It then took a further two hours before anyone arrived, a full seven after the initial call at around 4.30pm. 

 Joy said: 'At 11.09pm I called 999 again and stated how disgusted I was and three minutes later a single paramedic arrived in a car.'

The responder did not have lifting equipment so he had to call for another ambulance to attend as well.

'He radioed for another pair of hands to lift my mum up and two paramedics arrived minutes after in a 4x4. They got mum to her feet and she was very wobbly and confused,

A spokeswoman for South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust has since apologised for the delay and blamed a busy period of calls

'He said they had been really busy that night. He was brilliant but I just feel seven hours is far too long to leave someone.

'He informed us five crews had been issued to our job but were then diverted to more serious cases en route. The paramedics that came were fabulous but the wait was atrocious and I feel let down.'

A spokeswoman for South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust has since apologised for the delay and blamed a busy period of calls.

 'When a person falls at home and sustains no injury but needs lifting assistance, it is most appropriate for a community healthcare team to attend,' she added.

'Unfortunately, on this occasion the community team had no one available and so the ambulance service was asked to assist.

 'During this very busy period, South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust received 999 emergency calls within Bristol between 4pm and midnight on Friday 19 December 2014.

'All 999 calls must be prioritised to ensure patients suffering life-threatening emergencies receive attention as quickly as possible.

'It is for this reason that the ambulance service was unable to get to Mrs Sheppard any sooner.

'South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust would like to apologise to Mrs Sheppard for the time she had to wait for an ambulance to arrive.'
