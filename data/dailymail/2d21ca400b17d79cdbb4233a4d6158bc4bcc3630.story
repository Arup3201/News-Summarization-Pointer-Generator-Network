On the 26th July 1937, Gerda Taro was doing what she loved best. A noted photographer, she was busy documenting the progress of the bloody Spanish Civil War.

But tragedy was about to catch up with her. As Republican forces retreated in the face of an aerial bombardment, the car in which she was travelling was rammed by an out-of-control tank. Critically injured, Taro died the next day aged just 26 years old.

After Taro's death, a legend grew up around her but her work was often overshadowed by that of her former lover: war photographer Robert Capa. Now a new book looks set to change all that.

Tragic: Gerda Taro (pictured with Robert Capa) was killed aged 26 during the Battle of Brunete

Book: Rogoyska's new book suggests that Taro was responsible for work published under Robert Capa's name

Gerda Taro: Inventing Robert Capa tells the story of their ill-fated love affair and also illuminates their working relationship.

In 2007, a suitcase was discovered in Mexico that contained hundreds of negatives belonging to Taro, including many that had previously been attributed to Capa.

Now author Jane Rogoyskaya aims to shed light on Taro's extraordinary life and reveal the extent to which Taro influenced Capa, who went on to become one of the most famous photojournalists of his generation.

'Her early death, the overshadowing of the Spanish Civil War by the Second World War, and her connection with communism all contributes to her obscurity,' writes Rogoyska in the book.

'The rediscovery of Taro's photographs opens the door to more than just an insight into the brief career of a talented photojournalist. It allows us to re-examine the story of Gerda Taro herself and the partnership that so defined her.

'Behind the melodramatic newspaper tale of the heroic girl reporter tragically killed in action lies a highly complex reality, a fascinating story of image and identity, love and loss in which little is as it first appears.'

Robert Capa was born Endre Friedmann on the 22nd October 1913 in Budapest.

After moving to Paris in 1933 and meeting Gerda Taro, he adopted the name Robert Capa and made his name documenting the Spanish Civil War.

Following the death of Taro and the end of the war, he moved to New York but was soon back in Europe, covering the battles of World War II, D-Day among them.

Later, he would document the aftermath of the German campaign in Russia and the early years of Israel following independence in 1937, all while finding time to romance actress Ingrid Bergman, although he never married.

His death, when it came, was remarkably similar to Taro's.

Embedded with the French army during the First Indochina War, in May 1954, Capa was travelling through northern Vietnam when he left the convoy that he was accompanying to go ahead and photograph the advance.

According to those with him, the explosion that killed him came just five minutes later.

Capa had stepped on a landmine. He died hours later in hospital at just 40 years old.

And what a tale it is. Taro was born in 1910 to a family of 
German-Hungarian Jews in the city of Stuttgart. Known then as Gerta 
Pohorylle, her early life was uneventful.

But
after Hitler and the Nazis came to power, life became increasingly 
difficult for the Pohorylle family and in 1933, Taro was arrested for 
distributing anti-fascist pamphlets.

Forced out of Germany following her release in 1934, Taro would never see her family again.

In 1935, a year after moving to Paris, Taro met Hungarian photojournalist Endre Friedmann and fell in love.

Renaming themselves Gerda Taro and Robert Capa, the pair worked together to document the rise of the Popular Front in France, selling their photos under Capa's name.

But their French idyll was not to last. In 1936, civil war broke out in Spain and Taro and Garda travelled to Barcelona.

Together, they covered the war in Aragon and Córdoba, still publishing all the images under Capa's name.

By mid 1937, Taro had left Capa and was producing work under her own name, including iconic images of the bombing in Valencia. Sadly, Taro wouldn't have the chance to create many more.

After her death while covering the Battle of Brunete in July 1937, Taro's work was largely forgotten and her reputation overshadowed by that of Capa.

Iconic: Capa later became one of the world's top war photographers and took this shot of the D Day landings

But with the discovery of the 'Mexican suitcase' and the news that two films about her life are in the offing, Taro may not be overlooked for much longer.

Brave, beautiful and the inspiration for the hundreds of female war correspondents who have followed in her footsteps, as Rogoyska's book makes clear, it's time to reassess the legacy of the first female photographer to fall in battle.
