They may be an endangered species in the African jungles, but this playful pair look like they don't have a care in the world as they play piggy back in the safety of a wildlife sanctuary.

They are just two of 60 bonobos at Lola ya Bonobo Sanctuary in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

While the bonobos are under protection from staff members, at the sanctuary they are free to live as close to nature as possible by foraging for food themselves, picking their own mates and developing the survival strategies like avoiding poisonous snakes that they would need in the wild.

South African photographer Martin Harvey, 57, visited the sanctuary to bring back a heart-warming photographic record of the lives of the bonobos that make their home there.

'I was taking pictures of animals, habitat destruction and the bush meat trade in Central Africa,' said Martin.

'At the sanctuary bonobos live in an environment very similar to the wild and can forage naturally in their large enclosures.

He took pictures of the animals using stones to crack open nuts. 

'The use of stone tools by bonobos has not been observed in the wild,' said Mr Harvey.

'This behaviour is something they have learned from their keepers.'

According to their website the 30-hectare Lola ya Bonobo sanctuary is the world's only dedicated rescue centre for bonobos, in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

'The sanctuary founder, Claudine Andri established Lola ya Bonobo in 1994 just outside Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,' explained Mr Harvey.

'The chimps her staff take care of are all orphans of the bush meat trade.

'Claudine and her team work to educate local people about the endangered bonobo and the cruelty of eating bushmeat.

Friendship: Claudine Andre, founder of the sanctuary interacts with the bonobos

'Because of their work some of these orphans may eventually be reintroduced into the wild.'

Scientists believe there are only 50,000 wild bonobos left in the jungles of central Africa.

They are classified as endangered and their population is declining because of the destruction of the forests they live in and hunting by humans for the trade in their meat.
