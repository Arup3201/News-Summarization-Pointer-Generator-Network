An angry schoolboy wrote to his mother’s killer to tell him he had ruined his life.

David Wilder was jailed for life for murdering his former girlfriend Kerry Power in December 2013

A court heard 10-year-old Olly Power sent the letter to David Wilder who choked his mother to death as he slept in their home just before Christmas last year.

Part of his letter was read to a court by his grandmother Stephanie: It said: 'I feel very angry. If I was you I would be ashamed. I have a sad miserable life. You have ruined my life and my family’s life. It was nearly Christmas and we were happy.'

Yesterday 
tearful bus driver Wilder admitted murdering Kerry Power, 36, at 
her home in Plymouth, Devon and was jailed for life.

Judge
 Graham Cottle said Olly heard the life being strangled from his mother 
but ‘mercifully did not come downstairs to witness the act itself or the
 immediate aftermath’.

He said: 'It is entirely likely that he will be haunted by his memories of that night for a very long time if not forever.'

The judge said the murder was a ‘dreadful act’ and when Olly did see his mother under a duvet he did ‘not realise she was dead’.

He said Wilder, who must serve a minimum of 17.5 years, was a man ‘who liked to dominate and control women’.

In
 the days before the murder, Wilder, 42, bombarded Ms Power with texts and phone 
calls, stalked her, and turned up drunk at her house after she ended their two year romance. 

Police
 were called to Ms Power's house twice in the days leading up to her 
murder and officers told her to call them if Wilder turned up again.

The
 judge said Kerry dialled 999 at 1.10am as she was being attacked. It was 
almost a silent call but police could later hear her say: 'You have to 
leave. I don’t know how you got in here but I need you to leave, you 
have to leave.'

Wilder then strangled her as Olly heard noises which the judge said were his mother ‘struggling for life’.

Kerry Power, 36, had ended her two year relationship with Wilder before he strangled her to death

Taunton
 Crown Court heard that Olly was disturbed in the middle of the night 
when he heard his mother making ‘strange noises’ like she was being sick
 and Wilder making ‘muttering noises’.

Early
 that morning Olly got up and found his mum - now dead - lying under a 
duvet in the front room of the house with Wilder lying next to her.

The
 court heard Wilder strangled the primary school assistant to death four years after he had nearly killed his ex wife Kelly 
in a similar attack.

 'I
 feel very angry. If I was you I would be ashamed. I have a sad 
miserable life. You ruined my life and my family's life. It was nearly 
Christmas and we were happy'

The
 judge was told Wilder was given two police cautions for a series 
of domestic abuse incidents against his former wife, including one when 
he tried to throttle her.

The
 court heard in 2005 he threw a beaker at his ex-wife and then bent her 
legs so that her right hip came out of it's socket. And in 2009 he broke into his ex’s home through a window and climbed on top of her as she lay in bed.

Wilder’s own barrister Michael Fitton QC described him as ‘possessive’.

He told the court: 'He could not and would not let go.'
