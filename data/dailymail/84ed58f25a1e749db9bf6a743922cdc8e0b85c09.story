A Norwegian man has taken part in what might be the craziest ice bucket challenge yet - using a huge cement mixer lorry to pour 7,000 litres of freezing water over his head.

Lars Christian Rødal, a 29-year-old from the town of Hell, was nominated to take part in the charity challenge by a friend from Scotland, but described using a simple bucket as 'too wimpy' and so opted to organise his own extreme version of the stunt.

It took Mr Rødal a full 30 minutes to fill the massive cement mixer with ice-cold water, but only 30 seconds for it to be flushed over him as he sat in a chair.

The ice bucket challenge craze has already swept the world - with dozens of celebrities getting also involved in a stunt that requires participants to film themselves pouring freezing water over their heads before donating money to a charity that supports those suffering from motor neurone disease.

Massive: The video begins with the fully-loaded cement mixer lorry being driven onto a construction site to the sound of a melancholy piano loop

Getting ready: As a cement mixer driver by trade, Mr Rødal said it was fairly easy to guess the method he would chose to take part in the challenge

Mr Rødal was nominated to take part by a friend who lives in Scotland, and decided to carry out the challenge in the most extreme way he could think of.

Speaking to Norwegian television channel TV2, he said: 'A friend from Scotland challenged me to 
do the Ice Bucket Challenge, but I thought a bucket was too wimpy. I 
wanted something a little more extreme.'

As a cement mixer driver by trade, the solution seemed fairly obvious - and so Mr Rødal spent a full 30 minutes filling his vehicle's storage tank with 7,000 litres of freezing water.

The video begins with the huge, fully-loaded cement mixer lorry being driven onto a construction site to the sound of a melancholy piano loop. 

Mr Rødal is then seen taking up his position on a seat behind the vehicle and lighting a cigarette as the mechanism in the lorry begins to whir into life.

Brace: Mr Rødal winces in pain as the torrent of freezing cold water crashes over him

Seconds later freezing water begins gushing out of the lorry, with Mr Rødal wincing in pain as the torrent crashes over him.

The 29-year-old leaps out of his seat before the load is fully flushed, but returns seconds later to ensure he is not accused of chickening out of the challenge.

Unsurprisingly Mr Rødal said the stunt was incredibly painful, adding: 'It hurt. I lost feeling all over my body.'

Having taken part, Mr Rødal - like millions of others around the world - made a donation to a local charity that supports those suffering from ALS, which also known as motor neurone disease.

Mr Rødal is far from the only Norwegian to embrace the ice bucket challenge.

As a direct result of the ice bucket challenge, the Norwegian support group for sufferers of ALS said it raised 100,000 krone last week alone - the equivalent of £9,700.

Head of the ALS group in Norway, Mona Bahus: 'I think this is completely unreal. I 
felt everything was a bit slow because we are on the periphery to being 
barely a group at all.

'It has completely taken off during the last 24 
hours and now I feel that we are something! And that means being 
"something" for ALS in Norway,' she added.

The Ice Bucket Challenge began in 
the US earlier this year, with the American ALS association saying it 
has since received about £50million in donations.
