Claim: Dragons’ Den star Peter Jones revealed he limits his children’s pocket money to £25 a month

His work ethic has seen him build a business portfolio worth millions of pounds. And it seems Dragons’ Den star Peter Jones implements the same principles at home.

Yesterday the business tycoon, 48, revealed he limits his children’s pocket money to £25 a month - and expects them to earn it through household chores.

He said he has also told them he won’t be funding their first homes, but will reward money they earn themselves with contributions.

Giving an interview, in which he also criticised the national curriculum for not teaching children business skills, Jones said: ‘My pocket money is based on incentive. It’s like, “You’ve got to clean your room, to get this,” and if they don’t do it, they don’t get the money. It’s a bone of contention.’

Another prickly topic of conversation, no doubt, will be that Jones, who is worth an estimated £475 million, has told his children he will not be buying their first homes. Instead, he said will reward them by making small contributions on top of whatever they earn themselves, but offer nothing if they don’t make money.

He said: ‘I want my kids to be polite and respectful, stand on their own two feet. In the future if they want to go and do charitable work, then I’ll fund that charitable work. I’ve said that rather than me buying them a house, I’ll give them a contribution on top of what they deliver. So if they earn £20,000 a year, I’ll give them a tiny contribution on top. If they decide not to work, they don’t get anything. I want them to do it for themselves.’

Jones and his partner Tara have three daughters: Natalia, 12, Isabella, 10, and Talula, nine.

His two eldest children, Annabelle, 22, and William, 18, from his marriage to ex-wife Caroline – are now both older than he was when he set up his first company, a tennis coaching academy, aged 17.

Jones’ extensive business portfolio includes technology website Expansys, gifts company Red Letter Days, and the re-launched camera chain, Jessops.

And he has also established an entrepreneurs’ foundation for schools, after growing frustrated at the lack of business training in the national curriculum.

Speaking to Radio Times about the foundation, Jones said schools are ‘obsessed’ with times tables but fail to teach children about entrepreneurialism.

He said: ‘I’ve been campaigning as much as I can. I’ve been an advocate for ten years now, across two governments – first with Gordon Brown, then with David Cameron – on enterprise, and really encouraging, pushing, cajoling, to do everything we can to embed enterprise in our national curriculum, and I continue to be disappointed that we just pay lip service to the issue. We talk about going back to basics, and we talk about times tables. We’re far too obsessed with times tables.’

Jones added that while ‘it is important for us to be able to add up, obviously, we take it as read that our kids should be able to do that’, it should also be ‘taken as read’ that children are taught about entrepreneurism as well.

Dragons’ Den, which sees entrepreneurs pitch their ideas to the panel of Dragons, returns to BBC2 on Sunday at 9pm.
