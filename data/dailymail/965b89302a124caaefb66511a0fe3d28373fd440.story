Jamie Walker insists Hearts are taking nothing for granted in the title race despite stretching their unbeaten run in the Scottish Championship to 19 games.

The midfielder grabbed a superb equaliser to secure a point for the league-leaders against Edinburgh rivals Hibernian at Tynecastle on Saturday.

The result means the Jambos are still the only senior side in Britain who have not lost a league game so far this term.

Jamie Walker watches his strike fly in to cancel out Jason Cummings' 24th minute effort 

They also boast a 13-point advantage over nearest rivals Rangers but Walker warned the league is not won yet.

He said: 'No-one at this club will start celebrating anything until it is mathematically impossible for us to be caught in the league.

'There is still an awful lot to play for in the remaining weeks of the season.

'No-one here is thinking that things are done and dusted.

'If Rangers were to beat us in a couple of weeks at Ibrox, it would make things tighter and the boys will just keep focused.

'To be fair, everyone has been focused. As you saw against Hibs, it was not our best performance of the season.

'But everyone dug in and we managed to get out of it with a draw.'

Jason Cummings fired Hibs into a deserved lead in the 24th minute.

But hopes of ending Hearts' unbeaten run were shattered thanks to Walker's terrific leveller five minutes before the break.

He said: 'That is probably the best goal I have ever scored and I'm just delighted that it brought the boys a point.

'I think we have shown a good ability as a squad throughout this season to dig out results.

'Hibs played well, but we managed to stick in there because we did not want to be losing our unbeaten run.

'We don't want to lose it at all, but especially not here at home against Hibs.

'The boys deserve a lot of credit for being able to do that.'

Hibs midfielder Scott Allan admits there is little chance of catching their city rivals, with 19 points now separating the sides.

But he still has every faith in the Easter Road side's ability to win promotion back to the top-flight via the play-offs.

He said: 'This game was a real chance for us to set a marker down but we couldn't and it's going to be hard to catch them now.

'We just need to get back to winning ways next week and take it from there.

'The aim is to get back up to the Premiership and we believe ourselves we're capable of doing that.

'If we get to the play-offs I'd fancy us against anybody over two legs.'
