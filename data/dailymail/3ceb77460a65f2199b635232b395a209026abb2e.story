International showjumper Leonora Smee will make her debut as a flat-race jockey at Thursday's Magnolia Cup charity race at Glorious Goodwood.

Smee, at just 18, will be the youngest member of a star-studded field of courageous women which also includes top fashion model Edie Campbell and the ex-manager of 'The Clash' Tricia Simonon.

Smee will race in the first event of the day which is due to take place at 1:30pm.

Practice makes perfect: Leonora Smee will be hoping to impress at the Magnolia Cup on Thursday

Focused: Teenager Smee has been trained by top jockey trainer Michael Tebbutt

The teenager will ride Gone With the Wind in the six furlong challenge and will wear silks designed by Jasmine Guinness.

Smee has been put through her paces on the gallops at Newmarket by top jockey trainer Michael Tebbutt.

She said: 'All week I have been learning how to ride a serious racehorse and in doing so found myself aboard the famous Sailors Tale – a complete lunatic!

'I have now developed a huge regard for the skill and bravery of flat racing jockeys.

'Showjumping presents the obstacles that you don’t find on the track. I am normally seated in a chair compared with feeling like I am standing with my backside over the edge of a six inch window ledge, 20 stories up a building, in a howling gale – it is terrifying!'

The fourth Magnolia Cup, presented by Theo Fennell, involves the competitors taking on the roles of jockeys, silk designers and team supporters in aid of charities 'The Reading Agency' and 'Best Beginnings'.

Leading the way: Smee is at the head of the queue during training in preparation for the Magnolia Cup
