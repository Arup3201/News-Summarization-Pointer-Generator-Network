It is a dilemma faced by anyone invited to meet the Queen: what exactly does one wear?

This sniper serving with the Household Cavalry Regiment opted for his work outfit... leaving the Queen looking more than a little perplexed.

Looking like Chewbacca from the movie blockbuster Star Wars, the crack marksman wore a 'ghillie suit', a type of camouflage clothing designed to resemble heavy foliage, leaves and twigs to remain concealed from the enemy. The suit even moves in gusts of wind.

He also wore Army-issue brown boots and carried a powerful sniper rifle while chatting to Her Majesty.

The Queen, dressed in a long  violet coat with a matching hat, met soldiers and horses from the Household Cavalry Regiment when she visited Combermere Barracks in Windsor today.

She also took a tour of the training school where she saw a riding lesson being undertaken by Trooper Thomas Ephgrave, 19, from Leatherhead, Surrey.

Trooper Ephgrave has been learning to ride for four weeks, after joining the Army in March.

The
 Queen asked him about his horse, which is named Elizabeth after her and
 is often ridden by the Princess Royal at the Queen’s Birthday Parade in
 June each year.

She was also impressed to know that joining the Army was what Trooper Ephgrave had always wanted to do.

And the Queen, who famously loves 
horses, petted a drum steed called Adamas - 'Diamond' in Greek - who will
 be on official duty for the first time when the Emir of Kuwait visits 
Windsor tomorrow.

The drum horse was renamed Adamas today in commemoration of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee.

The Queen also seemed intrigued when shown armoured fighting vehicles which were at the forefront of Britain’s military operations in the Falklands, Bosnia and more recently in Iraq and Afghanistan.

She asked soldiers about their families and their time in Afghanistan. She then took part in a photograph with 875 members of both regiments.

Combermere Barracks is less than a mile from Windsor Castle and dates back to 1804. The riding school was built in 1881.
