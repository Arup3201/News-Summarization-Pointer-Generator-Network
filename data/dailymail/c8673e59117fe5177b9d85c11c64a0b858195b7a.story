Although we are most accustomed to seeing her dazzle on the red carpet, A-list actress Gwyneth Paltrow maintains that she feels happiest with a tea towel over her shoulder in her North London kitchen cooking for her family.

The budding chef has already divulged her diet secrets and favourite dishes in two popular cookbooks, and her latest offering is so hotly anticipated that it is taking pre-orders four months before its release date.

The 40-year-old's latest book of cuisine, It's All Good: Delicious, Easy Recipes That Will Make You Look Good and Feel Great, features recipes 'for the foods she eats when she wants to lose weight, look good, and feel more energetic', according to the description on Amazon.

According to the book's synopsis, after a grueling schedule and lapse of overindulgence last Spring, Gwyneth was left feeling fatigued and faint and a trip to the doctor later revealed that she was anemic, vitamin D deficient, and that her stress levels were sky high.

Her doctor prescribed an elimination diet banning coffee, alcohol, sugar, eggs, wheat, meat and processed food to clear out her system and help her body heal.

As an avid foodie, the actress was concerned that so many restrictions would make mealtimes boring and repetitive, so joined forces with food writer Julia Turshen to compile a collection of recipes that adhered to her guidelines and put the fun back in food.

The 185 recipes, which include huevos rancheros, hummus tartine with scallion-mint pesto, salmon burgers with pickled ginger, and even chocolate brownies with banana ice cream, apparently help the star feel more energetic.

During her twenties, Gwyneth followed an incredibly strict macrobiotic diet to keep in shape.

But the mother-of-two has certainly loosened up her diet a bit and now allows 
herself to indulge in her favourite treats, including pizza and French 
fries.

While she still detoxes before movie roles 
and works out religiously, she has revealed she eats liberally most of the time, and if her juicy roast chicken and no-fry fries recipes are anything to go by, we can all shun salads and look like Gwyneth in no time.

'Invest in what's real. Clean as you go. Drink while you cook. Make it fun. It doesn't have to be complicated. It will be what it will be

‘Cooking makes me feel so calm and happy – doing things that are routine and mundane. If I’m stressed out, I start to cook and I completely relax.’

'I love bread and cocktail sauce,’

'I honestly think that even ordering a pizza and sitting down together as a family is great.'

‘My dad loved to barbecue – he’d fire up
his grill and do all kinds of ribs, hamburgers and hot dogs. It wasn’t 
very healthy back in the day.

'I was macrobiotic for three or four 
years, but when I got pregnant with Apple I wanted french fries, grilled
cheese... it went out the window.

'I eat fish, a little dairy... but I 
love cheese. We'll make chocolate chip cookies and eat them, but sugar 
makes me feel pretty bad. I have coffee and wine. I've got lots of 
lovely vices.'

It's All Good: Delicious, Easy Recipes That Will Make You Look Good and Feel Great will be released on 2 April 2013
