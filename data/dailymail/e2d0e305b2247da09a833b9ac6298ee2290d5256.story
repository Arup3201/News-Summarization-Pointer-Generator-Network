Germany and Stuttgart defender Antonio Rudiger has dealt Chelsea's hopes of signing him a major blow by revealing 'his heart beats for Arsenal'.

The highly rated centre-back has been linked with both London clubs, but the 21-year-old announced he has dreamed of turning out for the Gunners since the Dennis Bergkamp and Thierry Henry era.

'I have been following Arsenal since the days of Henry and Bergkamp,' Rudiger is quoted in The Express as saying.

'I have always dreamed of the Premier League. I watch videos of Arsenal all the time on YouTube and I often wear the current Alexis Sanchez shirt.

'My heart beats for Arsenal.'

Rudiger has played four times for Germany, and would be welcomed  by Arsenal supporters who have criticised manager Arsene Wenger for not signing a central defender in the summer.

Stuttgart have made an indifferent start to their Bundesliga season, and are currently 15th in the table.

But Rudiger has been one of their most impressive performers, establishing himself as one of the most promising defenders on the continent and that could entice Wenger into making a bid in January.
