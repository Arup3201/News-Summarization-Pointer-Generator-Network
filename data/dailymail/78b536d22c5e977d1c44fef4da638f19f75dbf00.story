It is one of the first pictures showing Apple's expected new iPhone family in one place.

These images reveal two new model, one with a 4.7inch screen and one with a 5.5inch screen.

The devices are expected to be revealed in September- and go on sale soon after.

An image last week, also leaked by Sonny Dickson, revealed the two new iPhone 6 models side-by-side

The leak is particularly trustworthy as it comes from Sonny Dickson, the same Australian blogger who leaked last year's iPhone 5S.

The photos are believed to be mockups of the handset used so case manufacturers can prepare new products that fit the handset correctly.

They appear to confirm the handset will have a larger 4.7inch screen, and that Apple has moved the power button to allow the handset to be operated easily with one hand.

Production of the handsets is believed to already be underway in China.

The new images also reveal apple will continue to offer a gold version of the handset

Last week pictures of Apple's smaller iPhone 6 were revealed, showing the handset side by side with the current iPhone.

The leak came from former Taiwanese pop star Jimmy Lin who also leaked the iPhone 5 and the iPad Mini ahead of their releases.

Leaked shots of what appears to be the iPhone 6 is shown next to the current 5S. It has a 4.7-inch (11.9 centimetres) screen, according to reports, and is likely to be announced in September

According to Lin, the iPhone 6 comes with a 4.7-inch display, more rounded than the previous models.

He described the device as being 'very grippy' in the hand.

The device also has a headphone socket - despite recent rumours Apple could abandon a dedicated socket and instead use the lightning connector currently used for charging.

The leaks are the latest to hit Apple, all  showing an identical, slimline design.

However, Apple has not commented on the pictures.

New shots of the rumoured iPhone 6 have been revealed ahead of an expected launch in August or September this year.

Other recent images, republished by nowhereelse.fr, are similar to ones leaked before and lend credibility to claims this is what the next device will look like.

The latest photos show that the tentatively named iPhone 6 will be made from metal, and will also be much thinner than Apple's current range of devices.

Rumours suggest Apple is working on two versions of different sizes, with one being 4.7 inches (11.9cm) diagonally, the same size as the HTC One.

Latest images of Apple's supposed iPhone 6 were leaked last month (shown), showing a phone with an ultra-thin design and rounded images. The power button, typically found on the top of previous iPhones, appears to have been moved to the side, making the device easier to operate with one hand

A larger version is also expected to be released, measuring 5.5 inches (14cm) - slightly larger than Samsung's 5.1-inch Galaxy S5.

In the images some changes to button placement can also be seen.

The power button, usually found on the top of iPhones for example, appears to be located on the side of the device.

The volume and lock buttons, however, will seemingly remain where they are.

Look familiar? The rumoured back of Apple’s new iPhone 6 looks similar to that of the HTC One (pictured right) with a horizontal line at the top and bottom and curved edges. It also suggests Apple may have found a way to make its 'True Tone' flash technology smaller as the whole is different to an iPhone 5S

Apple's iPhone 6 is rumoured to come in a slim 'Air' version.

Up
 until August last year, Huawei was the record-holder for the thinnest 
phone in the world with its Ascend P6, at 0.24 inches (6.18 
millimetres).

This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 0.23 inches (5.75 millimetres). 

By
 comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 0.3 inches (7.6 
millimetres), while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 0.295 inches 
(7.5 millimetres).

Samsung's Galaxy S4 is 0.31 inches (7.9 millimetres) thick, while the HTC One is 0.37 inches (9.3 millimetres). 

It is believed the iPhone 6, which some think will go by the name of the iPhone Air, will sport a 1704 x 960 resolution display, and a powerful A8 processor.

The iPhone 5s, by comparison, has a 1136 x 640 resolution, and the A7 chip.

These hardware changes will be in addition to the features of Apple's latest iOS 8 software, unveiled last week, which include health monitors and smart notifications.

This latest in a long line of leaks comes as Apple chief executive Tim Cook and senior vice president of Internet Software and Services, Eddy Cue, visited Apple’s new campus in Austin, Texas.

During the tour, the pair told employees to prepare for the ‘exciting products’ the company has lined up for this year.

This was previously teased in an email from Cook to employees in Christmas last year.

These products could include Apple’s rumoured smartwatch and the iPhone Air.

Australian blog MacFixit claims this is the rear case of the iPhone 6. As well as environmental readings, the rumoured sensors would improve the accuracy and speed of the phone's location services

In May, Australian blog MacFixit said: 'We have just received from our contact in China a photo of what seems to be the back of an iPhone 6.

'We believe the picture to be genuine as we have received leaked product pics in the past that have also proven to be legitimate after official Apple product launches.'

German phone firm Deutsche Telekom then began telling customers Apple's iPhone 6 will launch on 19 September.

The operator told call centre representatives to let customers know the date in a bid to stop them swapping operators, it has been claimed by apfelpage.de.

Users of iPhone 6 could have sensors to track altitude, weather and even air pressure, according to code hidden in the iOS 8 operating system. This image is a screen grab from a video created by French site nowhereelse.fr. It features what is believed to be an industrial model of the iPhone 6 handset

According to Apple Insider, however, the date could be little more than an informed guess.

'The date is consistent with Apple's recent launches, making it likely an educated guess,' it said.

Apple historically launches its new iPhone models on Fridays, and 19 September does fall on a Friday this year.

Apple also began selling its latest smartphones during the same week last year, as the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c both became available on 20 September.

In 2012 Apple made the iPhone 5 available on 21 September. Prior to that, the iPhone 4S launched a few weeks later, on 14 October 2011.

Leaked images (pictured) and reports about Apple's next flagship phone - dubbed iPhone 6 - have been circulating since last year. If the rumours turn out to be true, the iPhone 6 will have a rounded, thinner design and a larger screen

French site nowhereelse.fr recently posted a video of a 'dummy' handset.

It was made using an industrial model of the handset believed to have been made to help case and accessory makers ensure their products fit the new design.

Taiwanese media then reported supply-chain sources similarly claiming a 4.7-inch screen version of the iPhone 6 will reach stores in August, with a 5.5-inch or 5.6-inch model released in September.

However, the Economic Daily News did not say which markets would receive the phone first.
