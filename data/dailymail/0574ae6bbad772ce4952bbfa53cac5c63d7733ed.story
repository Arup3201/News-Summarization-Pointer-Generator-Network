A Muslim convict found with an ISIS flag at a jail on the Isle of Wight plotted to take a prison officer hostage and make a violent escape.

The inmate, who is believed to have become radicalised inside the Parkhurst site, was found with detailed plans of the jail.

An internal prison service security bulletin said the convict had been moved into isolation immediately after the discovery.

The weekly bulletin of the National Offender Management Service, seen by the BBC, says that 'acting on intelligence a prisoner's cell was searched.

'Detailed escape plans involving taking a member of staff hostage were discovered.'

The report adds that movement at the prison was restricted 'whilst the accommodation and his associates were searched'. 

The inmate had drawn a black ISIS flag on a piece of material in his cell at the Category B prison, it is understood.

A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: 'Vigilant staff found a very basic description of the inside of the prison during a cell search at HMP Isle of Wight.

'This clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of our robust security measures. The prisoner is now in segregation.'

The Sunday People reported that the plotter was not known to the security services and that the man had only recently converted to Islam.

Previous prison officer kidnap plots, such as one at Belmarsh in 2010, have involved plans to behead the hostage.

However, it is thought that the Parkhurst plan was an attempt to escape, rather than to harm.

The Home Office said it would not comment on individual cases.

Isle of Wight prison was formed in 2009 as a merger of the Parkhurst and Albany sites.
