This chilling CCTV image shows the desperate flight of a man who had just stabbed two Big Issue sellers to death in a frenzied city centre knife attack.

Paranoid schizophrenic John Ward, 23, of no fixed address, pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility after killing Wayne Busst, 32, and Ian Watson-Gladwish, 31, in Birmingham on January 11. He has been jailed for life today.

Appearing via video-link from high-security Ashworth Hospital at Birmingham Crown Court, Ward remained impassive as Mrs Justice Thirlwall sentenced him to serve a minimum of 12 years in jail.

She said Ward was an 'exceptionally dangerous' man, adding: 'I do not know whether you will ever be released.That will be a matter for others.'

Peter Grieves-Smith, prosecuting, described how commuters watched in horror as Ward plunged a 8-inch knife into both his defenceless victims earlier this year.

Heroin addict Ward had met the pair, both fellow drug-users, for the first time a few hours before after getting off a train from London.

Ward, originally from Ireland and at the time an undiagnosed paranoid schizophrenic with a dissocial personality disorder, later told psychiatrists he had heard voices 'screaming in his head' telling him to kill himself.

He told Dr Panchu Xavier, at Ashworth Hospital, 'he didn't want to do anything but "the voices wanted me to kill everyone",' Mr Grieves-Smith said.

Arriving in Birmingham, he bought a kitchen knife at a supermarket which he said was for his own protection, along with whisky and later purchased a bag of heroin - which he smoked.

He met with Mr Busst and Mr Watson-Gladwish and despite getting on well with them for several hours, he struck without warning.

Afterwards, he told Dr Xavier at this point, 'the voices were going mad, screaming at me "kill yourself".'

'The voices were saying "kill random people",' he said

Just before the attack, a commuter had seen Ward 'acting strangely'.

Ward struck Mr Busst first, inflicting a 16 cm chest wound struck with such force it damaged the bone.

As
his first victim cried for help, Mr Watson-Gladwish tried to intervene 
and was stabbed twice, once in the abdomen and also fatally to the 
chest. Neither men had any defensive wounds.

Passers-by, including an off-duty nurse, tried to help the men and later two doctors and paramedics attempted open heart surgery on Mr Busst, but to no avail.

Meanwhile, Ward threw away his knife and fled to a nearby Odeon cinema where he sat and wiped blood from his face and hands with napkins until the police arrived to arrest him.

A staff member later told police: 'His eyes were wild, like a rabbit caught in headlights.'

The court heard Ward had a history of violence and had recently attacked a nurse at Ashworth.

In Ireland, in 2011 he was convicted of robbery and later the same year assault, receiving suspended jail terms for both, said Mr Grieves-Smith.

He added the reason Ward left London for Birmingham that day, was after a row with his mother in which he had punched her in the face.

In mitigation Michael Duck QC said his client's background had seen him grow up in Ireland in an abusive household, surrounded by alcoholism and drug-taking.

He said Ward had started drinking at age 
nine, was taking heroin by his early teens and was later taken into care
where he was sexually abused.

'From a very young age he reported hearing voices, which was a clear marker of the very significant mental health issues he's suffered and the tragedy is it's been picked up rather later in life, and we find ourselves now in this situation,' said Mr Duck.

Afterwards, the family of Mr Watson-Gladwish said no sentence would ever account for their shared loss.

Mr Busst's family said: 'It's hard to 
put into words how we feel at this time but it's true no parents should 
have to bury their child.

'There is little we can say about today's verdict as it will never bring Wayne and Ian back to their families.'

Arrest: The man is pictured being detained at the cinema - where he had cleaned the blood of his victims from his hands moments before police arrived

Detective Sergeant Mike Griffiths, of West Midlands Police, said the 'chilling reality' was that Ward's mental illness meant anyone could have been targeted that day.

'He was and still is an extremely dangerous man,' he said.

The two men's deaths prompted soul-searching from John Bird - the man who founded Big Issue - who said it had raised 'very big issues' about the safety of sellers.

In an interview with the BBC, Mr Bird said he knew first-hand how vulnerable people on the streets were to such random attacks adding the organisation had 'weathered' the trauma of the men's deaths only with the support of its vendors and the public.
