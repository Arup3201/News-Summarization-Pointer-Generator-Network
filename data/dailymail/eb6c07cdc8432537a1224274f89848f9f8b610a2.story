The hits just keep coming for MIT economics professor Jonathan Gruber, the Obamacare architect under fire for his controversial statements about the health care reform law. 

Video unearthed today by veteran White House reporter Keith Koffler shows Gruber agreeing that states' opposition to the Medicaid expansion dictated by the federal health law may be race-related.

He also claimed states that rejected federal funds for Medicaid wanted 'to punish poor people,' which he said 'really is just almost awesome in its evilness.'

The video released by Koffler on his news site, White House Dossier, is the latest in a series of damning videos of Gruber talking about the health care law that have popped up online recently. The comments have top Democrats, including President Barack Obama, disavowing both him and his claims.  

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO 

In this March photo Economist Jonathan Gruber is seen speaking at a conference of the Workers Compensation Research Institute in Boston, Massachusetts. Gruber is a professor at MIT and the architect of the healthcare reform laws in Massachusetts and the Affordable Care Act. He's taken fire over recently over comments he made about the latter

In previously released videos, the economist stated that the health care law 'was written in a tortured way' to ensure that the Congressional Budget Office did not label the individual mandate portion of the law as a tax.

'If CBO scored the mandate as taxes, the bill dies. Okay, so it’s written to do that,' he said during an academic panel in 2013.

'In terms of risk rated subsidies, if you had a law which said that healthy people are going to pay in – you made explicit healthy people pay in and sick people get money, it would not have passed… Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage,' he continued.

He then told the audience they could blame the 'stupidity of the American voter' for not seeing through Democratic spin.

I wish 'we could make it all transparent, but I’d rather have this law than not,' he concluded. 

The video that emerged today features Gruber and the University of Chicago's Harold Pollack discussing the Obamacare Medicaid expansion on behalf of the website healthinsurance.org in April of this year.

At one point in the conversation Pollack states that there's 'a politics of impunity towards poor people, particularly non-white poor people... it’s almost a feature rather than a bug in the internal politics in some of these states, not to cover people under Medicaid even if it’s financially very advantageous to do so.'

Pollack goes on to say that it's an 'important principle to defeat' politically 'because it’s such a toxic political perspective.'

'It has to be shown that that approach to politics doesn’t work, because otherwise we will really be stuck with some very unjust policies that will be pursued with complete impunity in some of these places,' he said.

To which Gruber replied, 'You know, that’s a great way to put it: There’s larger principles at stake here, when these states are not just turning down covering the poor people, but turning down the federal stimulus that would come with that.

'They’re not just not interested in covering poor people, they’re willing to sacrifice billions of dollars in injections into their economy in order to punish poor people. I mean, it really is just almost awesome in its evilness. And I agree, you have to recognize there’s larger principles at stake here.'

Left unsaid in the discussion was that the states that rejected the Medicaid expansion and the federal dollars that came with it in the short term were steered in that direction by Republicans in the state legislature or in the governor's mansion.

At a press conference during the G20 summit in Brisbane, Australia, last weekend President Barack Obama put as much distance between himself and Gruber as possible, arguing that the Obamacare consultant was never on staff at the White House

The White House has already addressed Gruber's other defamatory statements, with Obama spokesman Josh Earnest saying last week that he 'vigorously' disagrees with the 'stupidity' claim. 

Former Obama adviser David Axelrod said Sunday morning on Twitter that Gruber is the one who's stupid. 

'As one who worked hard to make ACA and its benefits clear, let me say: if you looked up "stupid" in dictionary, you'd find Gruber's picture,' he wrote.

And at a press conference this weekend in Brisbane, Australia, over the weekend, Obama made it clear to reporters that Gruber does not speak for his administration.

'The fact that some adviser who never worked on our staff expressed an opinion that I completely disagree with ... is no reflection on the actual process that was run,' Obama said.

'I would just advise every press outlet here: Pull up every clip and every story. I think it’s fair to say there was not a provision in the health care law that was not extensively debated and was fully transparent,' Obama said. 'It was a tough debate.'

While it is true that Gruber, who claims he 'helped write' Obamacare, never served on the White House staff, records show that the Health and Human Services Department paid him $392,600 consulting fees during the time the Affordable Care Act was being drawn up.

The economics professor's 'Gruber Microsimulation Model' aided the White House with estimations of how different aspects of the plan would be scored by CBO and whether it would consider affiliated costs taxes.  

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi also tried to disassociate herself from the Obamacare consultant last week by claiming to not even 'know who he is.'

In the next breath she claimed that, 'he didn't help write our bill.'

That directly contradicts a 2011 claim from Gruber that 'helped design the reform' as well as 'implement' it.

Likewise, he said he 'was a paid consultant to the Obama administration to help develop the technical details as well.' 

A March 2012 New York Times article also credits him with that work.

'After Mr. Gruber helped the administration put together the basic principles of the proposal, the White House lent him to Capitol Hill to help Congressional staff members draft the specifics of the legislation,' the article says. 

After video surfaced of Pelosi citing Gruber at a Nov. 5, 2009 press conference her office was forced to back track slightly, telling the Washington Post that she 'meant that she didn't know Gruber personally.'

'She said she doesn’t "know who he is," not that she’s "never heard of him," ' Pelosi's spokesman Drew Hammill said. 

Facet-checking website Politifact rated her claim as false however, pointing to the press conference incident as evidence that she did in fact know who Gruber was before the unflattering videos became national news.

'Even if the latter is true, that’s not what she said at the press conference, so we rate her claim False,' it said in a piece dissecting her statements.
