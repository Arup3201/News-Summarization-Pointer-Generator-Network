Thirty-three pages of text messages between Aaron Hernandez and New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick could be used as evidence in the former NFL player's murder trial.

Boston prosecutors have handed the messages over to Hernandez's defence team, according to Bristol County court documents released yesterday. There is no indication what they might say.

The documents also revealed that Mr Belichick was interviewed by police last August as detectives investigated the shooting of Odin Lloyd, whose body was found a mile from Hernandez's North Attleborough home.

A three page statement from Mr Belichick and a one-page statement from Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who was also interviewed, were also filed as evidence in the case.

But it is the text messages between Hernandez and Mr Belichick, sent and received between February and May 2013, which have got observers most excited, with the Boston Herald describing them as a 'treasure trove'.

The paper said spokesmen for the Patriots and Bristol County prosecutors turned down an invitation to comment, while Hernandez's defence lawyer did not return calls.

Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to murdering Mr Lloyd, a semi-professional footballer with the Boston Bandits, on June 17 of last year. He has also denied charges of murdering two men after leaving a Boston nightclub in 2012.

On Monday, a judge ruled in favour of prosecutors who wanted to use footage from Hernandez's own home surveillance system as evidence against him.

Judge Susan Garsh said seizure of the surveillance system 'was justified by the likelihood that it would reveal the identities of the individuals with Hernandez and Lloyd' in the hours before the shooting, the Herald reported.

She hasn't yet ruled on a request to suppress evidence from other cellphones and three iPads seized from the house.

On the same day, the lawyer for the cousin of Hernandez who was charged with criminal contempt after refusing to testify before the grand jury that indicted him revealed she intends to change her plea to guilty.

Tanya Singleton, of Bristol, Connecticut, had pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors say she was granted immunity but declined to testify.

Peter Parker, her lawyer, said during a brief proceeding in Fall River Superior Court that she will change her plea at the trial scheduled for August 12.

Gregg Miliote, a spokesman for Bristol County District Attorney Samuel Sutter, said sentencing for criminal contempt is at the judge's discretion. He would not comment on what the prosecutors will recommend.

Singleton pleaded not guilty to a contempt charge in connection with the Boston case after refusing to testify before a Suffolk County grand jury.

Mr Parker is seeking to consolidate the contempt cases in Fall River and said on Monday that his client intends to plead guilty in the Boston case, too.

'Ms. Singleton chose family over civic duty. That is not an incomprehensible or indefensible choice,' Mr Parker wrote in a court filing Monday requesting the consolidation.

Singleton also faces a charge of conspiracy to commit accessory after the fact in the Lloyd case. She isn't changing her not guilty plea in that case, Mr Parker said.

Prosecutors allege Singleton helped Hernandez's 'right-hand man' Ernest Wallace travel to Florida after Lloyd was killed. They also say she discussed helping Carlos Ortiz, another Hernandez associate, flee to Puerto Rico and got rid of a cellphone that Wallace had used.

Wallace and Ortiz have both pleaded not guilty to murder and accessory charges.

Singleton, who has been undergoing medical treatments for breast cancer in Connecticut, was not in Fall River for Monday's hearing. She is out on bail.
