The sun may be only just peeking through, but it’s enough for British supercar maker Aston Martin to launch its blistering new £200,000 flagship soft-top.

Perfectly styled for James Bond to cruise in with the top-down, the car firm describes it as ‘ultimate convertible super GT’ and the first with an all lightweight but super-strong carbon-fibre body.

Aston Martin, which is this year celebrating its 100th anniversary, said the new Vanquish Volante is a ‘no compromise’ car.

Luxury: The Aston Martin Vanquish Volante comes with a price tag of £200,000

It features an all carbon-fibre body, and a new  AM11 6.0-litre 565hp (573PS) V12 engine.

Its performance is identical to the Vanquish coupe sprinting from rest to 60mph in just 4.1 seconds and a top speed of 183mph.The order book opened today with first deliveries expected in the autumn.

Aston Martin says the body structure is the most rigid Volante it has ever built and means ‘uncorrupted ride comfort’ and precise handling.

The company's chief executive Dr Ulrich Bez said: ‘When the sun decides to shine you can lower the roof in just 14sec at speeds of up to 30mph. We don't want you to miss a moment of pleasure.’

Built at the firm’s boutique factory at Gaydon in Warwickshire, the new car’s powerful V12 engine is linked to a Touchtronic 2 six-speed automatic gearbox.

A spokesman said: ‘The Vanquish Volante – a stunning new luxury sports car that brings the thrill of open top motoring to the super GT class.

‘The Vanquish Volante is the first fully carbon fibre-skinned Volante in the brand’s 100-year history, while also being the stiffest Volante body structure yet created by the engineering team.’

He added: ‘Each body panel on the car is constructed from carbon fibre not just because of its high strength-to-weight ratio, but also for its flexibility of form.

'This not only reduces mass but means 
that fewer individual body panels are required – reducing joints and 
contributing to a more coherent and svelte shape.’

The sumptuous ‘2+2’ cabin features full grain Luxmil leather with optional quilting, metal controls and satin chrome trim.

The 279 litre boot is 50 per cent larger than that of the previous DBS Volante.

Aston
Martin design director Marek Reichman added: ‘Vanquish Volante is a 
sports car, of course, but more even than that it is the ultimate 
Volante – a  car which follows a long line of elegant Aston Martin 
convertibles.

'It is sculpted to convey sophistication as much as raw 
power.’

Such power requires 
good brakes and the new Vanquish Volante features third generation 
Brembo Carbon Ceramic Matrix (CCM) parts to deliver shorter stopping 
distances.

Aston martin chief executive Dr Bez said:
'This car is what luxury super GT driving is all about. Great 
performance, fantastic style and exhilarating Volante motoring in one 
superb package.

'Aston Martin is celebrating 100 years of excellence in 2013, and the arrival of this new sports car – our ultimate Volante – underlines that our mission to make the next 100 years even more successful is starting perfectly.’

Dr Bez added: ‘Vanquish Volante, like the Vanquish coupe before it, uses the very latest technologies employed in the very best ways to create a sports car which is easy to control, and to enjoy dynamic performance at the finest level.

‘This is not simply a great-looking car – this is a great car engineered and crafted for the connoisseur by people dedicated to delivering exceptional sports cars with clearly defined characters.’
