One of the men accused of murdering Stephen Lawrence was secretly filmed telling friends he wanted to torture and kill black people, the Old Bailey heard yesterday.

In an appalling racist rant recorded by a police surveillance camera, David Norris boasted he would use ‘two sub-machine guns’ in a plan to ‘skin a black ****’ and ‘blow their two arms and legs off’.

Then, he said, he would tell them: ‘Go on, you can swim home now’. He added: ‘They would be bobbing about like that.’

Suspects: Gary Dobson, left, and David Norris both deny murder

Norris, 35, and Gary Dobson, 36, are alleged to have fatally stabbed 18-year-old Stephen, an A-level student, in Eltham, South East London, in April 1993.

Twenty months later, in December 1994, police installed a covert camera inside Dobson’s rented flat in Footscray Road, Eltham.

Over a period of 17 days, detectives heard Dobson frequently use racist terms to describe black and Asian people, jurors were told.

Dobson was seen in one video clip recalling a time when he threatened a black colleague with a knife.

A brawl started between the pair when Dobson stole his baseball cap, and he later threatened the colleague with a Stanley knife.

Dobson said on the video: ‘I said, “Tap me once more, you silly **** , I’m going to slice this down you seven times”.’

He was also seen wandering around the flat with a large knife, and telling another man who is not on trial, Neil Acourt, that a ‘Paki’ had won the lottery jackpot.

On one occasion, Acourt was seen to hide a knife in his jacket before leaving the flat with Norris.Before
jurors were shown a series of clips from the surveillance video, the 
trial judge Mr Justice Treacy warned they might find the material 
distressing.

‘The material 
you will be watching shows the behaviour the prosecution alleges is 
racist and violent but you will have to be the judges of what it shows,’
he told them.

‘You may well find it shocking. If you do, you must remember that emotion has no part to play in this trial.’

The black and white sequences were shot over a number of days on a tiny camera installed low in the front room of the flat, close to the television.

Murdered: Black teenager Stephen Lawrence who was stabbed to death in April 1992

The conversations between Dobson, 
Norris and Acourt were heard with programmes such as Coronation Street, 
News at Ten and Gladiators in the background.

Stephen
was stabbed to death in Well Hall Road, Eltham, shortly after 10.30pm 
on April 22 1993, after being attacked by a gang of white youths who had
shouted racist abuse.

Detectives asked Dobson about his grey bomber jacket which prosecutors say is now at the heart of the case.

Dobson said: ‘Neither me or my jacket was out that night, the night of the murder.’

He went on: ‘Stabbing innocent people is not something we get off on, it’s not something we enjoy doing . . . we’re not animals.’

The court has previously heard that brothers Neil and Jamie Acourt were suspects in the original investigation and items of clothing were seized from their family home in Eltham during a police search.

Dobson and Norris were charged after a forensic breakthrough during a review of the case in 2007 and 2008.

Prosecutors claim that 16 fibres linked to the clothes Stephen wore on the night of his death were found on Dobson’s jacket and a multi-coloured cardigan, or in the evidence bags they were kept in.Scientists also found a tiny blood stain on the collar of his jacket and a fragment of blood which encased two fibres.

Defence lawyers claim that neither Norris nor Dobson was at the scene at the time of the killing and have suggested forensic evidence has been contaminated.

At the time of the killing Dobson was living in Eltham, and Norris lived three miles away in Chislehurst.

Dobson later rented the flat in Footscray Road with a friend.

Dobson and Norris deny murder. The trial continues.

They were separated by nearly two decades – the foul-mouthed teenager with a knife in his hand, and the sober-suited, quietly spoken man in the witness box.

One was Gary Dobson aged 19, filmed on a secret police camera the year after Stephen Lawrence was stabbed to death. The other was Gary Dobson aged 36, facing a murder charge 17 years later.

Yesterday an Old Bailey jury saw both of them – first when the 1994 video recording turned the clock back to the time when he and his associates were suspects; then when he took the witness stand to deny any involvement in killing the 18-year-old black student.

For the first time in this marathon trial, jurors witnessed the venom and racial hatred that was captured by a covert camera set up in Dobson’s rented flat. His friend David Norris, now his co-defendant, was heard bragging that he wanted to torture and kill black people. Dobson and one of his friends were seen holding large knives.

But yesterday Dobson, sitting just yards from Stephen’s parents in court, said he was ‘disgusted and embarrassed’ by the racist language he was heard using on the covert film.

He conceded there was ‘no denying’ he held racist views at the time it was made, but he added: ‘I don’t dislike people because of the colour of their skin.’ He said he had black, Asian and Chinese friends.

The stark contrast between the 1994 film and the figure in the witness box came on the first day of the defence case after nearly a month of prosecution evidence.

It was the first time the court has heard either defendant speak, save for answering to their names on day one – the first time, too, that either has been out of the dock. 

Earlier Dobson had sat in silence as the film was played to the court. Now he adjusted his striped blue tie, pulled down the waistcoat of his three-piece suit and sat facing the eight men and four women jurors.

Above him, in the public gallery, his mother and relatives watched. A dark-haired woman was in tears.

Asked by his counsel Timothy Roberts QC how he felt as he watched the film, Dobson replied: ‘To be honest with you, I’m not comfortable sitting there watching it. It’s the first time I’ve seen it in 15 years. It’s not something I’m proud of. It’s certainly not the way I was brought up to speak either.’

When he was filmed talking to his friend Neil Acourt about threatening to ‘slice’ a black workmate with a Stanley knife, it was ‘just a bit of bravado’, he said. ‘I think I was just talking up the situation and relating it to my friends . . . just being a bit stupid.’

Why did the surveillance film at his flat show him at one stage with a knife in his hand? ‘I can’t quite recall, but watching the video, I’d been cleaning and tidying up and everything else . . . there’s a chance I was making dinner at that time.’

What did he feel about being heard to call someone a Paki? ‘It’s not right,’ he said. ‘I can’t defend it. I can’t justify it.’ He would ‘definitely not’ have used that sort of language in front of his parents, he said.

And calling someone on TV a n***** ? ‘I suppose you could call it idiotic banter,’ he said, ‘. . . for the amusement of my friends sitting there with me. It was just a rude and stupid conversation.’

Dobson was adamant he was at home with his parents on the night of April 22, 1993, when Stephen was attacked by a gang of white youths at around 10.30pm. Dobson had been in his bedroom listening to music and playing computer games, he told the jury.

The only time he went out was some time around 11.30pm, when he called at the home of his friends Neil and Jamie Acourt, who, the court has been told, later became suspects in the police investigation. He went to borrow a Bob Marley CD and ask if they had a joint for him to smoke.

Wasn’t that rather late to be making a social call, his barrister asked? ‘It was,’ he agreed. ‘But at that age in life, for me and all my group of friends, it wasn’t too unusual to be going round late at night.’

Mr Roberts asked him: ‘Did you have anything to do with the events that led to the death of Stephen Lawrence? ‘No,’ Dobson replied. ‘I did not.’
