An artist has come up with an ingenious use for old car parts destined for the scrap yard - turning them into astonishing animal sculptures.

James Corbett welds together hundreds of components salvaged from vintage cars to make the stunning creations which are uncannily lifelike.

No car part is ignored as the 53-year-old turns them into animals such as hares, dogs, weasels, geese, chickens, iguanas and even a cheetah.

Mr Corbett, from Brisbane, Australia, was the owner of a specialist scrap yard when he started making objects out of old car parts in 1998.

He made one sculpture and displayed it on the counter of his shop, and within a few months he was taking orders for more.

His latest work is on display at The John Davies Gallery in Moreton-in-Marsh in Gloucestershire.
