A former radiology technician whose 'disinterest in her job' caused 10 patients to receive false negative mammograms was sentenced Tuesday to six months in prison and a decade of probation.

Rachel Rapraeger of Macon, Georgia told authorities that she had 'personal issues that caused her to be disinterested in her job' and that caused a backlog in her work. To catch up, she entered more than 1,200 clean test results, even though a doctor never looked at the scans. 

Of those total 1,289 women screened for breast cancer at Perry Hospital, 10 actually had the deadly disease and were never informed. Two of those 10 victims have since died.

Playing Russian Roulette: Ex-radiology technician Rachel Rapraeger, 33 (pictured), was sentenced to six months in prison and a decade of probation Tuesday after giving out more then 1,200 clean mammogram results without a doctor's review

On Tuesday, Rapraeger agreed to a plea deal which includes six months in prison, ten years of probation, a $12,5000 fine and she won't be able to work in the health field for a decade.

Judge Katherine Lumsden adressed several of the victims seated in the front row of court on Tuesday, saying there was no sentence that would fix what Rapraeger did.

'You played Russian roulette with the lives of essentially a thousand women in this community,' Judge Lumsden then told Rapraeger.

Some of the victims were also given the opportunity to address Raraeger in court.

Sharon Holmes was one of the victims who chose to spoke. She received a negative test result in December 2009 but then found out two months later that she had breast cancer and it had already spread to her lymph nodes.

Victims: Of the more than 1,200 clean results Rapraeger gave out, 10 patients actually had breast cancer and didn't know it. Some of the victims attended her sentencing on Tuesday and sat in the front row

Sharon Holmes was one of the victims to address Rapraeger in court Tuesday. Ms Holmes received a flase negative mammogram in December 2009, but found out just a few months later that she had breast cancer and that the disease had already spread to her lymph nodes

'You could have made a different decision and my family and I would not be living this nightmare,' Ms Holmes said.

Ms Holmes says it took courage to address Rapraeger, but she wanted to make sure her story was heard and she wasn't just another number.

'I'm not a name on a piece of paper, I'm a person, and I think she will remember me.' Ms Holmes told WMAZ.

Two of the victims ended up dying of breast cancer before they could see Rapraeger behind bars. Pictured above is Miriam Mizell who died in January 2012 in a photo posted on Facebook

Ms Holmes considers herself a survivor and has been in remission for three years, but is still not pleased with Tuesday's decision.

'If I'm living a sentence for having cancer then you should live a sentence behind bars,' Ms Holmes said.

Two victims were not as lucky as Holmes and died after getting their false negatives.

One of those victims was Miriam Mizell who died of breast cancer at the age of 63 in January 2012.

In a September 2010 interview with WMAZ, she said her mammogram came back clean in 2008 and two years later she received an offer of a free mammogram.

She took up the offer and the test came back positive

'I was lied to from the beginning,' Ms Mizell then said.

Rapraeger's attorney explained that his client entered the false negatives because she was overwhelmed and overworked.  

'She had too much work, and she was getting behind. She wanted to keep up,' attorney Floyd Buford said.

Rapraeger's
 attorney said part of the reason his client decided to take the plea 
deal was that the prosecution didn't have enough evidence to convict her
 since the hospital had destroyed her computer and hard drive.

Rapraeger
 was not taken into custody Tuesday, and remains free on $50,000 bail 
while she waits for a bed to open up at a probation detention center.

'I
 think it's a fair sentence based on what happened and based on her 
cooperation in this case,' said Daniel Bibler, the deputy chief 
assistant district attorney.

Mr Buford added , 'She's going to be paying a price, but even without that she's very remorseful.'
