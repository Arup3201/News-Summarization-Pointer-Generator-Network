The show is yet to begin but Judy Murray has already posted the first selfie for Strictly 2014.

Hours after the red carpet launch of the series, the mother of tennis champion Andy Murray huddled with her fellow celebrity contestants before forwarding the photo to her Twitter followers.

The 54-year-old’s red sparkly dress with cut-away panels is a far cry from the outfits she usually wears on the side of the court. However, she is clearly relishing her moment in the spotlight. 

Cuddling close to the stars: Judy Murray posted the first selfie of the series on Twitter with the caption: 'Selfie from the red carpet launch of Strictly 2014. Hope you like it kids'

Mrs Murray was joined by rivals including pop star Pixie Lott, 23, MasterChef host Gregg Wallace, 49, and TV presenter Caroline Flack, 34. 

But the contestant Mrs Murray appears to be fondest of is former Scottish rugby star Thom Evans, 29, who also features in several of her Twitter images which she posted ahead of a pre-record of the first show which will be seen by viewers on Sunday night.

In one Tweet she wrote: ‘This is the only dude I want to beat on Strictly.......Thom Evans. Local derby. #SCD,’ alongside an image of the pair arm in arm.

A short time later she posted a photograph of Evans being made up and wrote: ‘Thom Evans getting his slap on. He’s got his uber-sequinned shirt unbuttoned to the navel. Already. Desperate. #SCD.’

And when asked by a fan ‘who is this pretty man and where can I purchase one?’ Mrs Murray wrote: ‘It’s Thom Evans and I think u can buy him online.

It all appeared to be a bit of a laugh for Mrs Murray. Evans retaliated to her good natured Tweets with an image of her getting her nails painted, writing: ‘Hmm.. I wonder who the pre- Madonna is in BBC Strictly?’

But the exchanges are likely to leave Mrs Murray’s tennis star son Andy Murray unamused. Last night the former Wimbledon champion was preparing to take on Novak Djokovic in the US Open quarter-finals.

Earlier this year it was reported that Murray, 27, was embarrassed by his mother’s involvement in Strictly.

A source told a national newspaper: ‘He’s embarrassed, mortified and doing everything he can to avoid being dragged to a live show. It’s all a bit OTT for him. He likes his downtime when he’s not on the court unless it’s charity stuff.’

Before Mrs Murray was confirmed as a Strictly contestant, she said in an interview: ‘It was on the front page of the papers during Wimbledon and Andy asked me about it. I said “no” and he said “thank God for that, you would be absolutely terrible.'
