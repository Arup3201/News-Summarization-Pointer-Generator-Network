Their skinny jeans have graced many a
well-toned leg - from the Duchess of Cambridge to Cameron Diaz, J 
Brand's denim designs seem to flatter in all the right places.

The American brand has over eight years of experience in making must-have jeans including collaborations with high-end 
fashion names such as Hussein Chalayan and Proenza Schouler.

And now the trendy label is launching a capsule collection of the ultimate skinnies: jeans that are designed to make it look like you have been Photoshopped.

The best you can be: J Brand's new a/w 13 
collection is designed to make it look like you have been Photoshopped to perfection

The jeans are black, sleek, and, by all accounts, created to make you look a better version of yourself.

The secret is apparently a patented 
technological fabric that has been designed to resist the dreaded sag 
that often forms in the derriere region and the brand maintain that their new trousers will give you the perfect silhouette.

The brand maintain that the specially pioneered fabric and unique stretch doesn't sag and that you don't have to put them in the dryer to get that extra tight effect when you've just washed them.

New ethos: The label is shifting their focus from classic denim to 'party dressing' for autumn/winter 13 and Sam Rollinson is the star of their campaign

Donald Oliver, J Brand’s creative 
director, added: 'We have always looked at new and unusual ways to 
freshen up our denim offerings.

'This season we paid a lot of 
attention to fabric and fabric technology to give the J brand woman the 
softness she wants but without losing the fit and recovery of the 
fabric.'

The
jeans, which are usually priced between £75-£285, have also been 
designed to be comfortable, despite their figure-hugging style.

Shot by British fashion photographer Craig McDean, the new jeans are modelled by Sam Rollinson.

Speaking to Grazia Daily about his work, Craig said: 'Working with Sam Rollinson on the J Brand fall campaign was a pure delight,

'She brought a sense of professionalism and her own unique character and beauty to the pictures that expressed the modernity of the clothes perfectly. It was a great collaboration.'

Sam's big break into the fashion world came in 2010, when she was cast in a Burberry campaign alongside Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Douglas Booth.

She has since been a clothes horse for Balenciaga, Zara and Prada.
