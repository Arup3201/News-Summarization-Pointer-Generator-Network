Max Clifford, 71, was jailed for eight years in May after a jury found him guilty of indecent assaults

Disgraced publicist Max Clifford faces financial ruin after his sex abuse victims yesterday launched a legal bid to seize a large slice of his fortune.

He was jailed for eight years in May after a jury found him guilty of eight counts of indecent assault against teenage girls and young women between 1966 and 1984.

The former public relations guru is now facing a lawsuit for £1.5million in compensation from one victim, with more expected to follow. The action could see him being forced to sell off his portfolio of luxury homes.

Clifford was named in legal papers lodged at the High Court on Thursday by the first of six victims set to take legal action against him. A writ has also been served on him. He has two large homes in Hersham, Surrey – one he valued at £3.5million in 2008 and another, in which his daughter Louise lives, valued at £2.5million. But the rise in property prices means they could be worth a total of £8.5million.

The PR expert also has a house in southern Spain, which he valued at £1.5million in 2008. He made £2.5million a year from his PR work and the latest accounts for his company, Max Clifford Associates, in 2012 showed a turnover of £3.5million.

In total Clifford, who has appealed against the sentence imposed at Southwark Crown Court, is estimated to be worth around £10million though this will have been depleted by the legal cost of his defence.

He will also have lost a chunk of his fortune to his ex-wife Jo who was granted a ‘quickie’ divorce just weeks after he was jailed.

Last month he took steps to wind up Max Clifford Associates after a meeting of creditors.

But it is believed he may have other money stashed away in foreign bank accounts and investments.

Lawyers may ask any court which backs a civil action to freeze his assets and bring insolvency proceedings.

Last night the anonymous victim who launched the action said: ‘What he did to me and others was unforgivable. He used his position and status to abuse us. We are now picking up the pieces of our broken lives.

‘I will use any compensation I receive to pay for further psychological therapy which I feel will help me regain some measure of normal existence.’

She is represented by solicitor Richard Scorer, of Slater & Gordon, who said: ‘If Max Clifford is seeking a reduction in his sentence, he now has an opportunity to show that he is truly remorseful. He should admit his offences and compensate the victims he so shamelessly abused.’

Mr Scorer also confirmed that Slater & Gordon will be bringing up to six further civil actions against Clifford in the forthcoming weeks.
