An artist has created a series of hyper realistic finger paintings which look just like choppy seas, and spectacular icy landscapes.

Zaria Forman, 31, whose works take up to a month to complete, has created the landscapes to document the ever-changing beauty of regions affected by climate change.

Forman, from Brooklyn in New York, USA, led an Arctic expedition to the north west coast of Greenland purposely with the aim of creating art inspired by the dramatic geography.

Her mother, Rena Bass Forman, originally came up with the idea but died before her daughter could see it through, and so she promised to carry out the journey in her name.

After formal training at Skidmore college Forman now exhibits extensively in galleries and venues throughout the United States and overseas.

Forman's drawings that served as the set design for the classic ballet Giselle, and were used in the set design for House of Cards, a Netflix TV series directed by David Fincher and starring Kevin Spacey. 

The paintings are put on sale on her own personal site, ranging in price from £3,000 ($6,000) to £4,500 (around $9,000).

Her main focus is pictures of the ocean, with much of her art taking the form of pictures of sea spray on the shore, or water cascading over rocks or icebergs

Zaria Forman paints waters that are incredibly choppy, and ones that are serenely still, with both giving her a unique challenge in her work as an artist

In addition to exhibitions, recent projects include a series of drawings that served as the set design for the classic ballet Giselle, which premiered in October 2012 at the Grand Theatre of Geneva, Switzerland. Ten of the drawings were also used in the set design for House of Cards, a Netflix TV series directed by David Fincher and starring Kevin Spacey

Some of Forman's works of art look hyper-realistic, while others are more artistically vivid, but all of them revolve around the same theme

Sometimes the sea takes a backseat in focus to other parts of the picture, like the photo-realistic clouds, and the wind blowing spray into the air

Each of Forman's pictures are an attempt to capture a unique part of the landscape, where sometimes the icebergs and land masses are the focus, and other times they take a back seat to the ocean

Some of Forman's pictures look so realistic you would be forgiven for thinking that they are simply photographs rather than laborious works of art

The artworks all seem to capture a particular theme; cold, made possible by Forman's extensive use of rich, deep, blue coloured paints

Originally from Brooklyn in New York, Forman, led an Arctic expedition to the north west coast of Greenland purposely with the aim of creating art inspired by the dramatic geography

Some of Forman's works of art have been inspired by standing on the shores of the ocean, while others were inspired by the arctic voyage

Forman's mother, Rena Bass Forman, originally came up with the idea but sadly didn't live to see it through

The finger paintings also seem to capture warmer seas, with this particular image looking more like tropical ocean than arctic ocean

Some of Forman's works have gone on sale for around $9,000 in private sales and auctions, and many are advertised on an artwork selling site

In her paintings, Zaria Forman has not only captured the freezing cold areas, but also the time of day, with many pictures depicting different stages of her voyage to the icy seas

This picture, depicting flowing seas disrupting calmer ones, was perhaps inspired by the view from a boat voyage, of the sea rather than a larger vista
