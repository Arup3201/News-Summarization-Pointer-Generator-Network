She proved a match for Nazi Germany when she broke Hitler’s codes at Bletchley Park, so Lord King of Bridgwater should have known better than to comment on the advancing years of Baroness Trumpington of Sandwich.

The formidable 89-year-old Conservative life peer was unimpressed when her relatively junior colleague gestured towards her to illustrate his point about the extreme age of World War II veterans.

Lady Trumpington hit back against his patronising reference with a distinctly unparliamentary gesture of her own - commonly known as the two-finger salute and reminiscent of Winston Churchill's famed V for Victory' sign.

Two-finger salute: Baroness Trumpington gestures towards Lord King of Bridgwater to show just what she thinks of colleagues making reference to her age

Inspiration? Was Baroness Trumpington mimicking Winston Churchill's 
famed 'V for victory' gesture'?

The extraordinary scene unfolded while Lord King was making a speech about the passing of the wartime generation during the Remembrance Day debate in the Lords on Thursday.

Lady Trumpington appeared to be minding her own business peering down at some papers over her spectacles as the former Defence Secretary paid tribute to veterans of the first World War who had ‘gradually faded away’.

Then turning towards Lady Trumpington, Lord King, 78, raised his arm towards her and continued: ‘And then the survivors of World War II started to look pretty old as well. As my noble friend, the Baroness, reminds me.'

At this point, Lady Trumpington glared at him with disdain, raised two fingers at him to signal ‘up yours’, and then went back to studying her notes.

The exchange instantly became an internet hit with viewers describing the former chain-smoking Lady Trumpington – known by colleagues as ‘Trumpers’ - as a ‘heroine’.

Lady Trumpington, formerly Jean Alys Barker, yesterday claimed that the gesture was not intentional and insisted her hand must have ‘flown up’ accidentally.

She told the Daily Mail: ‘I didn’t mean to make the gesture. My hand must have flown up. I have never been offended by Lord King. I don’t remember doing it.’

Born in 1922, Lady Trumpington was also a former Mayor of Cambridge. Between 1989 to 1992, she was a minister of state at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food – which, at the age of 69, made her the oldest woman minister ever.

In 2005, she was made a Dame Commander of the Royal Victorian Order. As a  Baroness-in-Waiting she was a member of the Royal Household.

A former 70-a-day smoker, Lady Trumpington is well-liked by colleagues for her wicked sense of humour and straight-talking.

During a debate on equality, Lady Trumpington sent peers into gales of laughter by revealed that booking into a hotel used to give a ‘certain frisson’ as her late husband had to use a different name.

When she was a guest on Desert Island Discs, she chose the Crown jewels as her luxury item, in order to maximise her chances of being rescued.

Lord King last night insisted that the pair were ‘old friends’ and that Lady Trumpington had been joking with him when she made the gesture.

He said: ‘We had been joking together before we went into the chamber.

‘She is a wonderful person and was the only person in the chamber who had been in the second World War and was taking part in the debate.

‘She made some sort of gesture. I think it must have been my reference to her age. But there is absolutely no ill feeling between us at all. She is a very old friend of mine.

‘She went on to make a wonderful contribution to the debate and was on very good form. It is rather frightening that this is now all over the internet. I hope nobody thinks I was offending her.’

Lord King served in the Cabinet from 1983 until 1992 and was appointed Defence Secretary under Prime Minister John Major during the Gulf War.

He left the Cabinet after the 1992 general election, and returned to the backbenches where he served as Chairman of the Intelligence and Security Select Committee from 1994-2001. He was made a life peer in 2001.

One comment on the website Total Politics said: ‘My headmaster's wife way back in the 60s, and a formidable battleaxe back then. Bless her. Lord Blagger - up yours. She's a fine woman who has had an illustrious career in the Lords for many many years.’

Another added: ‘Surely it was a reference to Churchill’s victory gesture?’
