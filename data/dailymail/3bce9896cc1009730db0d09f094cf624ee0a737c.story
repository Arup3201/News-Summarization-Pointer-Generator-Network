Canoe fraudster: John Darwin, 63, of Seaton Carew, near Hartlepool, is due to be questioned on suspicion of breaching the terms of his early release

Canoe fraudster John Darwin was arrested last night moments after flying home from a trip to find a Ukrainian bride.

The 63-year-old, jailed for six years for faking his death for a £500,000 insurance payout, is due to be questioned on suspicion of breaching the terms of his early release.

A warrant is understood to have been issued for his arrest alerting police at all ports and airports to detain him on his return. He was apprehended at Newcastle airport.

The apparent parole breach means he is likely to serve another nine months in jail — meaning he will spend Christmas behind bars.

Darwin was not supposed to leave the UK without official permission but travelled to Ukraine last month for a date with Anna Avramenko, 25.

They met through a foreign brides website for women seeking a rich husband. Miss Avramenko dumped him after finding out about his past and labelled him a ‘sex-starved criminal’.

The Ministry of Justice has said Darwin, granted parole in 2011, can expect to be returned to jail for the breach of parole.

He broke the conditions of his early release by travelling the 1,700 miles from his home near Hartlepool to visit Miss Avramenko in the industrial town of Sumy.

The tall blonde said she agreed to meet Darwin after he bombarded her with sleazy messages, which included requests for a threesome and boasts that he could ‘satisfy any woman’.

He claimed hundreds of women wanted to meet up with him and said he had received 240 messages in one day, she said.

It is unclear which travel documents he used to visit Ukraine as it was thought his passport was not due to be returned until next March.

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘Any offender subject to licence supervision is required to gain permission from probation to travel outside of the UK.

'Permission is only granted in exceptional circumstances. Any offender who travels without this permission will be subject to recall to custody.’

Miss Avramenko, who has a six-year-old daughter, said that during a three-month email exchange, Darwin told her that one of his favourite hobbies was kayaking.

He also allegedly tried to persuade her to sleep with him by saying Westerners often have sex on the first date.

How Anna Avramenko described Darwin

Darwin was declared dead in 2003, a year after apparently drowning on a canoe trip. His family claimed the insurance money, yet all the while he was living in a hidden part of the home he shared with his then wife Anne, 61.

The swindle deceived the police, a coroner, a number of financial institutions and even their sons Mark and Anthony.

The couple moved to Panama but in December 2007 Darwin walked into a London police station claiming he had amnesia.

He survives on a pension of £138 a week in a £100,000 bungalow in Seaton Carew near Hartlepool.
