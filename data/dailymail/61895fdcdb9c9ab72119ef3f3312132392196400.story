A Chinese woman has spoken of her horror at discovering her breast implants had migrated to her back and stomach.

Tian Hui, 39, had plastic surgery to enhance her bust in 2002.

She had hoped the procedure would boost her confidence after she discovered her husband Chiu, 41, had cheated on her with a younger woman.

Hope: Mrs Tian has the operation in 2002 after she found discovering her husband had cheated on her with a younger woman. She had hoped the surgery would boost her confidence

But more than ten years after the surgery, her implants began moving.

Despite her efforts to push them back into place, they continued to move further away from her breasts.

Mrs Tian said her confidence hit rock 
bottom after her husband’s infidelity and she underwent the surgery in 
the hopes of winning back his affections.

She
 said: ‘I always believed we had a good marriage, at least until I 
discovered that he had been having an affair with a woman who was six 
years younger than me.’

The couple, 
from Guangzhou in China's Guangdong province, had been together for 
eight years, setting up a restaurant and building the business together 
to make it a financial success.

After
 she discovered the infidelity they decided to stay together for the 
sake of their family, but she still felt she was no longer attractive 
enough and decided to have plastic surgery.

Bad practice: Despite her efforts to move the implants back into place, they continued to migrate further away from her chest

Nasty surprise: When doctors removed the implants they found the had been made by injecting the now banned substance polyacrylamide hydrophilic gel

Extreme case: Although her implants has been out of place for a while, it was the recent drastic movement of the implants that forced Mrs Tian to have surgery

She
 said: ‘I contacted a surgery in the neighbourhood and arranged for them
 to make my breasts bigger in the same year.

'But I couldn't believe it 
when I woke up one day several years later and realised they had 
actually moved.'

‘I was 
really embarrassed and tried to hide it by moving them back again.

'But every time I went to sleep and woke up the next day, they had moved.

'And each time it was a further distance than the day before.

‘Eventually
 when I woke up one day and found that one of my breasts was on my back 
and the other was down by my stomach, I realised I had to do something 
and so I checked in for further surgery.

‘I
 was actually really scared about the damage that the moving breasts 
might have done to my body, and it was incredibly painful.’

Back in shape: Surgeons removed the implants from her back and stomach and replaced them with two new ones

Surgeons
 operated on Mrs Tian, removing the moving breasts and putting in new 
implants.

Liang Hao, a doctor at the General Hospital of the Guangdong Armed
 Police, removed the material that had been injected into Tian’s breasts - polyacrylamide hydrophilic gel.

He said: ‘This material is poisonous if injected into the body. It can not only do harm to the nerves but also to the kidneys.

‘In extreme cases, it can cause cancer.’

He
 said that its usage had been illegal in China since 2006. But the 
damage from the moving breasts for Tian was more than just physical.

Tian
 said: ‘My husband was not impressed and this has become a real problem 
between us. I think he is colder now than ever before towards me.’
