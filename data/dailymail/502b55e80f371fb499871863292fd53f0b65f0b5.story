Attorneys for a former mortician serving a life sentence for the death of a rich East Texas widow are seeking a lighter sentence.

Bernie Tiede  is in prison for the 1997 death of 81-year-old Marjorie Nugent in a case that inspired Richard Linklater's 2011 movie 'Bernie.'

Panola County Court documents unsealed Wednesday show Tiede's attorneys want to introduce new evidence of a history of severe sexual abuse of Tiede and an abusive relationship between him and Nugent.

Tiede's attorney, Jodi Cole, writes that the abuse finally pushed Tiede over the edge and he shot his elderly companion.

Tiede, now 55, was convicted in February 1999 of killing Nugent and keeping her body in a freezer for nine months.

In Richard Linklater's latest film, Jack Black plays Bernie, the gay mortician that befriends a wealthy widow at her husband's funeral, shoots her in the back and spends her millions while desperately trying to hide the fact that she's packed in a freezer alongside chicken pot pies.

Mr Tiede met Mrs Nugent at her husband's funeral and through a series of events, became her trusted companion and only friend.

The two of them traveled the world together, spending her fortune on lavish getaways, airplanes and even scholarships for the poor.

'We had a ball,' Mr Tiede told The New 
York Times. 'I think I probably saw her happier than anyone in her 
family ever did. Including her husband. She kind of opened up to me. She
 became a different person.'But over time, Mrs Nugent became 
increasingly demanding, he told the News Journal, requiring Mr Tiede to 
clip her toenails, pluck the hairs off her chin and never leave her 
side.

'She was very possessive of my life — so much of my life — for the last few years. And it got worse,' Mr Tiede said to the paper. 'I guess that’s what made me just snap.'

During his trial, Mr Tiede said that he arrived at Mrs Nugent's home at 7 a.m. the morning of her death to make her breakfast.He noticed a .22-caliber rifle she kept around for shooting armadillos and scaring squirrels from her bird feeder and put it near the garage. The two prepared to leave the house around 10 a.m. to head over to the dry cleaners when Mrs Nugent stopped to pet her dog.

Mr Tiede shot her four times in the back and stuffed her in the freezer, between flounder and chicken pot pie, where she lay for nine months as he spent her fortune.

'Bernie’s not the first one who thought about killing her,' said writer Joe Rhodes, who also happens to be Mrs Nugent's nephew. 'He’s just the first one who went through with it.'

Mr Rhodes recounted his relationship with his aunt as difficult, to say the least, as well as the trial for her murderer.

He visited the set of the film in Carthage, where the town welcomed the film with open arms and several residents even served as extras.

'There are little things in Bernie that aren’t exactly true, bits of dialogue, a changed name here and there,' Mr Rhodes said. 'But the big things, the weirdest things, the things you’d assume would have to be made up, happened exactly as the movie says they did.'

Many thought Mrs Nugent was the meanest woman in East Texas, he said, and her killer was one of the nicest folks around.

'This town is split up,' District Attorney Danny Buck Davidson, who prosecuted Mr Tiede, told the News Journal at the time. 'People remember him as being real nice and doing nice things, and they'd like my office to go real easy on him. And then, there's a group that wants no mercy.'

Mr Tiede was sentenced to life in prison and thanks to Mr Linklater, an eternity on the big screen.

'There was something about Aunt Marge’s ending up in a freezer that seemed appropriate,' wrote Mr Rhodes. 'She’d always been kind of coldhearted.'
