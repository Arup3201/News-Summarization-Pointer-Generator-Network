BBC controller of English regions David Holdsworth, pictured, spent £11,050 wining and dining between 2010 and 2013

The BBC has censored details of the licence- fee-funded ‘champagne  and seabass’ meals enjoyed by executives – because  it says the ‘dietary preferences’ of staff should be kept secret.    

The Corporation has imposed the ban in  response to The Mail on Sunday’s revelation that it had spent more than £30,000 of public money holding ‘editorial meetings’ at top London restaurants in the past year.

Receipts published by  this newspaper showed  that the executives had enjoyed dishes of seabass and 31-day dry-aged fillet steaks, accompanied  by glasses of champagne  and chablis.

Now the BBC has announced that it is refusing to release any more lunch or dinner bills on the grounds that members of staff had a right to enjoy ‘privacy’ over their menu choices.

The ban came in response to a Freedom of Information request for further details of executive dining habits.

The BBC said: ‘On a previous occasion that such information was released, a newspaper published an article which contained strong criticism of the individuals involved. Information relating to an individual’s dietary preferences will attract a strong general expectation of privacy as it is inherently personal to the data subject.’

Our article, published in December, revealed that David Holdsworth, the controller of English regions, spent £11,050 on wining and dining from 2010 to 2013.

Tory MP Rob Wilson said it was 'astonishing' that the BBC refused to be held to account over their 'profligate spending'

The second most lavish spender was Peter Johnston, the £152,000-a-year director of BBC Northern Ireland, who spent £5,185, while Roger Wright, the £227,000- a-year controller of Radio 3, spent £4,758.

At the time the BBC said that it employed 20,000 people ‘and this expenditure, released under our disclosure rules, equates to £1.50 per person, per year’.

Last night Tory MP Rob Wilson said: ‘It is astonishing that the Corporation refuses to be held to account for its continued profligate spending. It has a deep, ingrained disregard for  other people’s money.’
