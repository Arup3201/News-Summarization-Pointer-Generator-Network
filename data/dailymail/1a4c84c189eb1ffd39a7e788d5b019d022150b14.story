Diego Simeone has been given an eight-game ban after being sent off for tapping the fourth official's head during Atletico Madrid's Super Cup win over Real Madrid on Wednesday. 

The Argentine was sanctioned with four games for slapping the fourth official on the back of the head after his first-half dismissal, two for protesting, one for applauding the decision and another for giving instructions to the team from the stands.

The Atletico manager cut an animated figure  at the Vicente Calderon and was punished 25 minutes in by referee Fernandez Borbalan for laying hands on  Antonio Santos  after a heated exchange.

Alan Pardew knows a thing or two about being punished for laying hands on  match officials.

The Newcastle boss was sent to the stands, given a two-match touchline ban and fined £20,000 for pushing linesman Peter Kirkup during a 2-1 win over Tottenham in 2012.

That didn't calm Simeone down, though, as the 44-year-old paced back and forth in the terraces and witnessed his side beat Real 1-0 on the night and 2-1 on aggregate.

Before leaving the touchline, Simeone instructed the home faithful to get noisier as they tried to keep Real quiet.

That hot-headed approach made its way on to the pitch, as Real midfielder Luka Modric was sent off for a second yellow card in the dying moments.

The game between the Madrid and La Liga rivals saw a total of eight yellow cards as the Spanish referee took a no-nonsense approach to the hefty challenges flying in on Friday night.

The game was settled by a Mario Mandzukic goal just two minutes in as the new signing made an instant impact since making his move from Bayern Munich as a replacement for Diego Costa.
