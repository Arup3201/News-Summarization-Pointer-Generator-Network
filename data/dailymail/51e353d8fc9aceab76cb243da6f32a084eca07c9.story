A group of bystanders managed to lift the car and pull the pair out when they become stuck under the vehicle around 7:45pm, according to the New York Post. 

A cardiologist who was driving at the time then performed CPR on the unconscious man but could not save him.

Dr. Kishore Nallu told the Post: 'I saw them under the car. I ran out and saw the lady under the rear of the car. The gentleman was pinned under the front.'

He described how the driver of the SUV ran out and started screaming and asked if there was a doctor.

The motorist then gathered a group to lift the car in a bid to rescue them. Miss Sauchelli is said to be in a stable condition in a New York Hospital.

The driver was reportedly cited for unlicensed operation of a vehicle. The NYPD are still investigating.
