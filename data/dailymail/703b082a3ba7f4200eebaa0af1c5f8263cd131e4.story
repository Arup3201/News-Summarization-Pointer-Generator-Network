Justin Bieber's live-in pal Lil Za, who was arrested on Tuesday morning at the superstar singer's California mansion for alleged drug possession rounded off a day to forget as he was released from Lost Hills Sheriff's station late last night.

However, before he was let go, he found the time to get arrested again - this time for vandalism inside the jail.

According to a law enforcement source, Za, whose real name is Xavier Smith, was preparing for his release at the station when he lost his temper and damaged a phone inside the holding cell he had spent the entire day in.

Minutes away from posting the $20,000 bail for possession of felony narcotics found during a raid on Bieber's home, Za was re-booked for vandalism according to Lt. Michael Williams after he apparently furiously banged the handset against the dial and and his bail was readjusted to a reported $70,000.

Twice in one day: Bieber's close friend Lil Za was arrested on charges of cocaine possession at the singer's home during Tuesday morning's raid - he was later arrested and charged with vandalism inside jail just moments before he was due to be released

'Zavier Smith was additionally charged with an incident that resulted in felony vandalism concerning a phone located in the holding cell this afternoon at the Lost Hills Sheriff’s Station,' said Lt. Michael Williams to HollywoodLife.com.

Williams confirmed to MTV News that Za was released from prison late on Tuesday night and that contrary to other reports he damaged 'not destroyed' the phone in his holding cell.

Earlier in the day, according to TMZ, Los Angeles law enforcement officials revealed that the drug found 'in plain sight' at Justin Bieber's mansion in a Tuesday morning raid was molly, a form of ecstasy, and not cocaine as originally believed.

The drug was found along with the prescription sedative Xanax as police executed a felony warrant to search the sprawling Calabasas property.

According to a law enforcement source, Za, whose real name is Xavier Smith, was moments away from release at the Lost Hills/Malibu Sheriff's station when he lost his temper and damaged a phone inside the holding cell he had spent the entire day in

The warrant was related to allegations that the singer had been responsible for throwing eggs at a neighbor's home in an exclusive gated community in Calabasas, California, last Thursday - causing more than $20,000 worth of damage.

The singer's good friend, rapper Lil Za, was arrested after officers found the drugs during the raid on the 19-year-old singer's home.

TMZ reports that what police originally believed to be cocaine was actually the drug molly, or MDMA.

'You have to analyze any evidence to see what comes forward,' spokesman Steve Whitmore said. 'It may not be that particular narcotic,' said LA County Sheriff Steve Whitmore.

'Let’s just wait and see, but we’re fairly certain it’s a controlled substance,' Whitmore said according to the LA Times.

For Lil Za, the difference is about two years in the slammer.

Lesser crime: Sheriffs haul away Lil Za. If the drug that was allegedly in his possession was MDMA and not cocaine as was originally believed he faces a far lesser jail sentence if convicted

Whereas the cocaine could have landed him in prison for three years, the molly possession could mean closer to one year for him.

Officials says Bieber was 'not connected' to the drugs.

Aerial images showed the rapper being led away by several officers before being driven to the police station in the back of a cop car. 

Lil Za, real name Xavier Smith, has been widely regarded as a 'bad influence' on Bieber for over a year. He was supposed to have been moved out of the singer's home but according to reports he has been 'staying at Bieber's Calabasas home for months.'

Eleven L.A. County Sheriff's patrol cars were spotted entering Bieber's gated community to look for 'video surveillance or other relevant evidence' to link him to the incident.

Eight people, including the singer, were detained in the property’s garage as deputies executed the warrant.

In a press conference following the raid, an L.A. Sheriff's Department official said the singer 'had not been arrested nor exonerated' in the egging case.

It is estimated that a dozen deputies, who brought a battering ram, carried out the search looking for any evidence to might link the singer with the egg assault.

Bieber was not questioned at the scene regarding anything except standard search-warrant inquiries and would likely handle any questioning through his attorney later, said Whitmore.

Police later issued a press release about the raid on Bieber's home.

It said: 'Search Warrant Served at Calabasas Home after Estimated $20,000 Vandalism on January 9.

'At about 8am on Tues, Jan. 14, 2014, detectives from Lost Hills/Malibu Sheriff’s Station of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department began service of a search warrant at the Calabasas home of Suspect Justin Bieber.

'The purpose of the search warrant is to seek video surveillance or other possible evidence in the vandalism that occurred on January 9, 2014. The vandalism damage is estimated by the homeowner to be approximately $20,000.00. The investigation is ongoing.'

Thompson declined to describe what evidence detectives took from Bieber's home, but said the emphasis wasn't on what was in the pop star's refrigerator.

He said the house Bieber allegedly egged had custom wood and other expensive features and that several thousands of dollars in damage occurred. Thompson added that a judge authorized the search warrant.

'I get that the eggs don't seem that significant, but it does rise to the level of a felony,' Thompson said.

'But a felony crime is a felony crime, no matter how you commit it,' he said, 'and this crime rose to the felony section, and a judge signed a search warrant saying we should go get evidence related to the felony crime.'

'There is a victim in this case who has extensive damage done to their home. And that's a serious incident.'
