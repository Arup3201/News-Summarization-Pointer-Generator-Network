If Andy Robinson had led Scotland to victory over Tonga two years ago, it’s possible that Vern Cotter would still be enjoying French cuisine rather than being introduced to the culinary delights of a Killie pie.

It was the defeat at the hands of the South Sea Islanders at Pittodrie that led to the Englishman’s resignation — and opened the door, eventually, for the Cotter era.

Delayed for a year after the SRU refused to buy out the final 12 months of his contract at Clermont Auvergne, the change has been worth waiting for if the Kiwi’s first six matches in charge are anything to go by.

Vern Cotter prepares his Scotland players for their Autumn international against Tonga

Scotland look a team reborn and go into the match against Tonga at Rugby Park looking to make it five wins out of seven under Cotter, the only defeats coming against the top two sides in world rugby, New Zealand and South Africa.

The head coach’s time in charge has led to a change in fortunes of not just the team but also of back-row forward Johnnie Beattie, who had never been a Robinson favourite.

In fact, the former Glasgow star was so far out of the picture under him, he didn’t even make the 60-strong training squad put together for the three defeats to New Zealand, South Africa and Tonga in 2012 that eventually led to his resignation.

Beattie holds no ill-will against Robinson, but if he had still been in charge, perhaps the 29-year-old would have been on club duty for Castres this weekend rather taking the field at No 8 for his country.

The focus is the future, however, not what might have been, and Beattie knows how tough it will be to win a regular starting place in a Scotland team playing what he believes is the best, most exciting rugby he has seen since he made his debut against Romania in 2006.

The way Cotter, not the most demonstrative of men, has gone about his business since he took over last summer, has convinced him the national team is going places.

‘There is no selling of the sizzle with him,’ said Beattie. ‘There is no razzmatazz and falseness.

‘He is just a good old-fashioned bloke, who is a good rugby coach. Already we can see after two games of the Autumn Tests his imprint, his game plan, his structures and how he wants us to go about our play. We are definitely in a better place under him.

‘Overall, he has made minor adjustments and has changed the basic structures of our play. How we get into phase play, how we keep the ball, how we stretch defences. All those things, those simple things, he has come in and implemented in a better way.

‘It is quite clear he has made a massive difference, especially when you realise this is mainly the same group of players, with a few youngsters coming in, that he is working with compared to coaches before.’

Beattie, who celebrated his 29th birthday on Friday, believes the Scotland fans are also buying into the Cotter era, with the atmosphere against New Zealand the best he had ever experienced at BT Murrayfield.

‘The rugby we are producing is making it more of a spectacle for our supporters and we saw that from the support we got against New Zealand,’ he continued.

‘We did not win, granted, but the effort, our ability to retain the ball, the ability to stretch teams, meant we gave the supporters something to shout about. I have not seen that level of support pretty much since I have been involved.

‘That game against New Zealand was the first time I have been back at Murrayfield since we lost to England in the Six Nations nine months ago, when we got humped 20-0.

‘We showed absolutely nothing and produced absolutely nothing and could not create anything for our fans to get behind us for or to enjoy. In that space of time, to go where we have been to where we are now is great and very encouraging, but the important thing is we keep working and keep getting better.’

The competition for the No 8 jersey is fierce. South African Josh Strauss will be eligible to play for Scotland through residency in time for the 2015 World Cup and with Adam Ashe, David Denton and Ryan Wilson also in contention, the match on the artificial surface at Rugby Park is a vital one for Beattie.

He wasn’t picked for the 2011 World Cup in New Zealand and is determined not let the showpiece occasion in England next year pass him by.

‘I would love to be involved in the World Cup but rugby is a funny old game and you never know what is going to happen,’ said Beattie. ‘In the life of a professional rugby player, you see injuries all the time, players in and out, coaches change their views on you.

‘I didn’t make Andy Robinson’s squad two years ago and I know things can change very quickly, so I am under no illusions how hard I have to work to be retained by this coaching team and the effort I have to put in.

‘It starts against Tonga today on an artificial surface on which it is hard to keep your feet. Everyone will have to work hard to keep up at scrum time and at rucks so we don’t give away stupid penalties.

‘This is a big game for all of us, including me, and is my chance to impress Vern and to be part of what I think could be a very good time for Scotland going forward.’
