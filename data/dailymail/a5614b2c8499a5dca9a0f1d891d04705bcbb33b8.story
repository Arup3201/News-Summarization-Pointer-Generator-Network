UKIP’s policy chief Tim Aker said he was too 'scared' to cut the cost of public sector pensions

UKIP’s policy chief has admitted he is too ‘scared’ to confront Britain’s public sector pensions black hole.

Tim Aker, head of the party’s policy unit said he had looked into public sector pensions, adding ‘I have, and then got very scared and ran away.’

His comments came in an interview with Prospect magazine in which he revealed the party’s manifesto would include a vast array of tax cuts.

Ukip would, he said abolish income tax for anyone paying the minimum wage, and increase the point at which people can earn before paying 40p in every pound they earn.

This would rise from the current £41,865 to £45,000.

And he said the party would abolish the 45p rate for those earning £150,000 or more, adding: ‘We are for flatter, simpler and lower taxes.

He said the party’s proposals would make people’s lives easier and help them ‘just get on and feel more comfortable’.

But the party will face question marks about how it intends to pay for all the tax cuts, which initial estimates suggested could cost £20billion or more.

His comments on public sector pensions will also raise questions about whether the party is serious about dealing with big problems the country faces.

Later in the interview he appeared to change tack, saying the party ‘haven’t looked into’ the public sector pensions problem.

The cost of public sector pensions to taxpayers is expected to rise to up to £1,600 a year within the next decade.

Around £4 in every £5 paid out in generous public sector schemes is accounted for by taxpayer funding because public sector workers’ contributions will not cover payments.

Mr Aker said that despite all the tax cuts proposed, Ukip intends to cut the budget deficit. He said the party would cut foreign aid and abolish the Climate Change Act.

It will not propose an increase in the retirement age.

Overall he said the party would fight on a ‘blue-collar platform’ of aspiration.

In addition, the party would restrict child benefit to two children and stop migrants claiming any benefits until they have been earning and paying tax and national insurance for five years.

Nick Clegg and George Osborne have both attempted to take credit for the Government's decision to increase the personal tax threshold to £10,500. The Lib Dems and UKIP have announced they want this to rise to £12,500 by 2020

He said higher benefits would be available for those who have contributed but who lose their jobs.

‘There will be an offer for people who have paid in to the pot and find themselves for a considerable amount of time unemployed – higher jobseekers’ allowance.

‘We are prioritising people who work and pay into the pot instead of people who have made a living out of having children so that they can get more benefits and a bigger house.’

Mr Aker is UKIP MEP for the Eastern Counties and prospective candidate for Thurrock in Essex at the General Election.
