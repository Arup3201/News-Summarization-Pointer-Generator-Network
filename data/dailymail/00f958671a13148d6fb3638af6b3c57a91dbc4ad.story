A landlord and the woman 
22 years his senior he married to dodge immigration laws were jailed for
a total of six years for running a sham marriage business.

Four suitors facing deportation paid Mohammed Tanin, 26, £2,200 each to jet in prospective wives from Portugal.

Within a week of their arrival on June 30, 2010, each of the women had applied to the Home Office for permission to marry.

Mohammed Tanin and Maria Marques have been found guilty of their part in a visa scam

As European Union citizens, their 
automatic right to remain in the UK would also have applied to their 
husbands, who were all on student visas, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard.

Tanin's wife, Portugese citizen Maria Marques, 47, told the grooms 'they can cook, they can clean and they can marry you'.

The couple's marriage at Bow, East 
London, on November 24, 2009, was also a sham to keep Tanin in the 
country after his student visa expired.

The Bangladeshi  landlord, who owned several 
properties in the Poplar area of east London, set up similar schemes for
his Bangladeshi tenants.

He also offered to sort out a marriage for Omar Hossain, a work colleague in the catering department at London Zoo.

Tanin and Marques denied entering into
a sham marriage and conspiring to arrange four more, but were found 
guilty of all charges by unanimous verdicts after a trial last month.

Tanin was jailed yesterday for four years and Marques for two years for their parts in the conspiracy.

Maria Marques helped bring in the 'brides' from her native Portugal

Sham brides Tama Perpetuo, 24, and Ana
Cunha, 22, who pleaded guilty, were each given 14 day jail terms after 
their potential husbands were let off with cautions.

Passing sentence, Judge Inigo Bing described the scam as 'fraudulent exploitation of an immigration rule.'

He said: 'Every national government has a duty to protect its borders and to control the number of people entering the country.

'In the UK these functions are 
exercised in a lawful and transparent way through the Immigration Act 
and enforced by the UK Border Agency.

'UK citizens expect those laws are 
enforced because confidence in our system of border control is sapped if
it is perceived that foreigners are living here who have not been 
permitted to do so.

'An organised conspiracy to breach that law is therefore a serious offence.

'You established a relationship of 
some power in respect of some Bangladeshi students and then use that 
power to persuade them to begin proceedings to enter into a sham 
marriage.

'Such a scheme could not take place without brides and that's where Ms Marques enters the case.'

The court heard Perpetuo was heavily pregnant at the time of the marriage application.

Giving evidence, Mr Hossain said Tanin had 'tricked' him into paying £2,200 to marry a stranger.

He claimed the landlord had borrowed 
the cash for a 'business' venture but refused to give it back, instead 
offering him one of four women he had flown to the UK to be contract 
brides.

Mr Hossain, who was facing deportation, applied to marry Maria De Matos just one week after meeting her in June 2010.

He filled out a Certificate of 
Approval for Marriage application under Tanin's supervision, claiming De
Matos had lived in the country for more than a year.

By marrying women from Portugal, whose capital Lisbon is pictured, the men would automatically be allowed to stay in the country

When the Home Office asked for more information, he claimed to have met her in a Central London pub six months previously.

Mr Hossain said: 'Tanin said he was 
not going to return my money. He said I could take a chance and use my 
opportunity to get married to one of these ladies and that way he 
wouldn't have to pay me back.

'At that point I realised - he's quite business-minded - it had all been a trick to sell his product.'

After their arrival at London Luton 
Airport on an Easyjet flight, the brides were all taken to Tanin's 
then-home address at East India Dock Road, Poplar.

Two of them moved in with their would-be husbands straight away, while the other two stayed with Tanin.

But when they applied for their 
Certificates of Approval for Marriage, three of them on the same day, 
all four were rejected after border officials became suspicious.

Michael House, defending Tanin, said: 
'If the scheme had succeeded, the consequence would have been that four 
industrious and hard-working young men would have been entitled to stay 
in the country.

'Whether that would have been a benefit or a detriment to the country is really an open question.

'Immigration is a very delicate and 
controversial subject. A degree of hysteria is sometimes generated, 
which can transfer itself into government policy and government 
legislation.'

Mohammed Tanin, of Willis Street, 
Poplar, and Maria Marques, of East India Dock Rd, Poplar, had denied 
entering into a sham marriage.

They also denied conspiring to arrange
sham marriages between Tama Perpetua, Ana Cunha, Zahirul Islam, Maria 
Do Rosario Fonesca and Robiul Amin Johami, Ana Cunha and Khaled Hossain 
and Maria de Fatima Ferreira Cabos de Matos and Omar Hossain.

The applications for marriage were made in July 2010.

Perpetua, of Lodore Street, Poplar, and Cunha, of the same address, admitted conspiracy to arrange their own sham marriages.

Atiq Haque, of the specialist crime 
directorate, said: 'I think we're impressed with the result and it goes 
to show that if people choose to embark on this journey, the 
Metropolitan Police will bring them to justice.

'These people exploit the system that's in place and make it more difficult for genuine applicants to stay.

'They put extra pressure on the UK Border Agency by creating extra cases for them to look into.'
