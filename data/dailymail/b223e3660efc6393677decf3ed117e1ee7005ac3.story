Chelsea have been asked to play a friendly at Stamford Bridge by East Stirling - with the Scottish club hoping the Blues will fulfil the terms of a transfer which was completed 52 YEARS ago.

Eddie McCreadie joined the Blues in 1962 in a £5,000 switch and the two clubs agreed to play each other at the two club's home grounds.

However, while the side's clashed at Firs Park, the planned game in west London never took place.

Proposal: Chelsea have been asked to a friendly by Scottish club East Stirling to fulfil a 52-year agreement

Switch: Left-back Eddie McCreadie joiuned Chelsea from East Stirling for £5,000 back in 1962

Chairman of The Shire, Tony Ford, has contacted Chelsea to see if they will play this summer having recently come across the old documentation.

Speaking to the Daily Record, Ford said: 'As far as we can tell it is a legally binding agreement that sets out the terms of the transfer, which included cash plus home and away games between the clubs.

'I’m not sure if a game against us was in Mr Mourinho’s pre-season plans but you never know.'

Left back McCreadie, who was capped by Scotland 23 times, went on to make over 300 appearances for the Blues.

Money well spent: McCreadie spent eleven seasons with Chelsea and made over 300 appearances for the club
