Jane Andrews, a former aide of the Duchess of York who was jailed for murdering her wealthy lover. She is set to face a Parole Board hearing next month

The Duchess of York’s killer aide Jane Andrews could be free for Christmas after winning a new parole hearing.

Andrews, who murdered her wealthy lover in a rage when he refused to marry her, will face a Parole Board hearing next month.

The former royal dresser, was jailed for life for stabbing to death Thomas Cressman, 39, in 2000.

Two years ago, she was denied parole after escaping from prison. Now 46, she works in the laundry at Send Prison in Surrey.

Mr Cressman’s brother Rick 62, has vowed to fight her bid. 

‘We believe Jane Andrews is a danger to the public,’ he said. ‘In 14 years, she has never shown any remorse.

'The day Tommy died was the start of a life sentence for us. We think about him every day.

'Traditionally, a life sentence was 25-years and I believe that Andrews should serve that.”

Mr Cressman, who runs a successful hotel, said his mum Barbara, 86, is distraught.

He added: 'She told me that she thinks of him every day and even speaks to him.

'There is a moment when she will tell Tommy her feelings in the hope he hears her.'

Mr Cressman and sister Cathy, 60, will attend the hearing to give a statement.

They will tell of the emotional toll and how they feel Andrews has shown no remorse.

Mr Cressman added: 'All she does is to try and justify her actions.'

Given Andrews’ history, the parole board is more likely to send her to an open jail.

A source said: 'Jane believes she has done enough to be moved to an open jail.

'She knows this is the first step towards eventually being released and is quietly confident.

'Jane has been a model prisoner for the last couple of years and has been sure to show remorse.

'She has been a keen member of therapy groups and has ticked all the boxes.

'However, many in the prison think she is manipulative and a threat to men.”

Andrews was given a life term with a minimum of 12 years in 2001.

The Parole Board will include a top psychologist, prison staff, probation workers and parole members.

The clinical psychologist will assess Andrews’ mental state before the parole hearing.

He will conclude whether she is a danger to the public.

Andrews became friends with the Duchess of York, 54, during nine years working as her aide.

She joined her on royal duties both at home and abroad.

She stabbed businessman Mr Cressman to death at the house they shared in Fulham, South West London, after clubbing him unconscious with a cricket bat.

Her Old Bailey trial heard Andrews had a history of depression and severe mood swings.

Andrews had been moved to open jail East Sutton Park in Kent, but she absconded in 2009. She was returned two days later.

Mr Cressman said: 'I fear she will be downgraded to an open prison. Let’s hope she doesn’t walk out again.

'She is a manipulative individual and would do or say anything to win her freedom.' 

A spokeswoman for the Parole Board said: 'We do not comment on individuals.'
