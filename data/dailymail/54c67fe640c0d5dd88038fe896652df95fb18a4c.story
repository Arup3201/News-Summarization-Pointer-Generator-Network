Atlanta Falcons head coach Mike Smith feels his team have prepared well for Sunday’s International Series game against the Detroit Lions, but one man is still playing on his mind.

Lions wide receiver Calvin Johnson is still an injury doubt for the game, and coach Smith knows the importance of being prepared if ‘Megatron’ plays at Wembley.

Johnson trained for Detroit for the third straight day on Friday at their Bagshot base, and Smith is ready to change his game plan at the last minute if need be.

‘If Calvin plays then you have to know where he is and you have to have a different game plan,’ Smith said after Atlanta’s practice on Friday.

‘You have to know where Calvin is going to line up and put more resources to stop him because he is one of the most dangerous wide receivers in football.’

The Falcons have practiced at Arsenal’s London Colney training base all week, and Smith is pleased with how things went for his team.

‘The facilities here are fantastic,’ the Falcons coach said. ‘It was a really good week of preparation. Arsenal have been very accommodating to let us use their facilities and been great hosts.

‘We got a lot accomplished in terms of our game planning and we now have to go out and execute on the field.

‘Tomorrow we will have a walkthrough at the Grove (Atlanta’s hotel). We will then head into town and spend some time with the fans at the Fan Rally in Trafalgar Square.

‘We are looking forward to seeing the crowds, and then we’ll check into our hotel across the road from Wembley Stadium and have meetings on Saturday night.’

The Falcons head into Sunday’s game with a 2-5 record and occupying third place in the NFC South behind the Carolina Panthers (3-3-1) and New Orleans Saints (2-4).

Smith said Johnson, the Detroit Lions wide receiver, was one of the most dangerous in football

‘It’s our most important game because it’s our next one,’ Smith said. ‘We are right in the thick of a tough divisional race and it is going to be very important for us to go out and play efficiently.

Wide receiver Roddy White added: ‘Every game is a must win. We are one game away from first place in our division. If we can go out on Sunday and get something going to get us a win, then it will be a positive and we can roll into the bye week and go from there.

‘Practice has been really good and we’ve been really focused the last few days. It has been really smooth for us and we’ve made a good transition. We expect to play well on Sunday.’
