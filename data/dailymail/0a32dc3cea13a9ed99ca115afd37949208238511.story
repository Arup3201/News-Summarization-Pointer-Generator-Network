Andy Carroll has been keeping busy as recovers from his latest injury setback - by modelling for the Alexander Wang for H&M fashion campaign.

The West Ham frontman, who has been on the sidelines since suffering ankle ligament damage during the club's pre-season tour to New Zealand in July, was on his first assignment since signing for agency Select Models.

Carroll was up against 200 other candidates to be the face of the campaign but was the chosen one and showed off a whole new set of skills.

Carroll has yet to play this season and is currently recovering from knee ligament damage 

In an interview with Vogue magazine, the England forward said: 'I obviously had heard of Alexander Wang but until I walked on set I didn't realise how big this campaign was.

'I was being told that everyone who was working on the campaign was fashion royalty; the world's top stylists, hairdressers and photographers were all there!

'It was all a bit surreal to be honest. The set and location were unbelievable; I've done photo shoots for West Ham and England before but nothing like this, there were so many different people running around with cameras and TV screens everywhere, it was seriously impressive.'

Carroll described his modelling debut as 'surreal' but expected to be back in front of the camera lens soon

Carroll, 25, thought it wise to keep the final set of snaps away from his team-mates.

'Modelling has never been something I have considered, I guess my focus has always been on my football,' he said.

'There is plenty of banter that goes on in the dressing room every day, but there are worse things to get stick about than being a model!'

Despite the sucessful debut, Carroll is not quite planning to follow in the footsteps of David Beckham and launch his own fashion line.

He added: 'I don't think I'm quite ready to take on Becks yet. I will leave that to him for the time being, I'm going to concentrate on the day job of scoring goals for West Ham and hopefully England.'
