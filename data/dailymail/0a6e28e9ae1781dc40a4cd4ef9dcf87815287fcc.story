Tesco is planning a shake-up that will see ranges and price discounts tailored to the incomes of families who live near its stores.

The move is designed to breathe life into UK sales after a disastrous fall in Christmas takings.

In poorer areas, where there is a threat from successful budget chains such as Aldi, Lidl and Iceland, Tesco will stock and promote more value lines, it is claimed.

Target practise: Tesco is planning to adapt its product range and discounts relative to the wealth of an area

For richer or poorer: Customers in more affluent areas will be pushed to buy top-of-the-range items such the company's Finest products (left), while those in less well-off locations will have better deals on its Value lines (right)

And in affluent areas stores will push the retailer’s top-of-the-range Finest lines in an attempt to stop customers deserting to the likes of Sainsbury’s, Waitrose and Marks & Spencer.

Tesco already has a policy of charging more in its smaller Metro and Express stores than mainstream supermarkets. 

The company, Britain’s biggest retailer, also charges different prices for petrol based on location and the level of local competition.

Tesco does, to some extent, tailor its ranges to the affluence and shopping habits of customers, based on information gathered through its Clubcard loyalty scheme.

Second chance: The strategy is being pushed through by Tesco's UK chief executive Richard Brasher (above), who was behind the unsuccessful 'Big Price Drop' campaign

Details of the new strategy, which is said to go much further, were revealed by Tesco suppliers who have been talking to industry magazine The Grocer.

The magazine said: ‘Tesco is set to launch a wave of price promotions and range reviews based on the affluence of areas.’

It said the strategy is being spearheaded by the chief executive of its UK business, Richard Brasher.

Mr Brasher was also the man behind Tesco’s ‘Big Price Drop’ campaign, which has failed to deliver the boost in sales and profits the company was looking for.

The move, which promised annual savings worth £500million, was part of an attempt by Tesco to be re-cast as a champion of low prices.

However customers, who have continued to see the cost of their weekly shopping increase, were not won over.

Rivalry: Tesco is now having to beat off fierce competition from the likes of budget chain Aldi which has experienced strong growth in recent years

Underlying sales in the crucial 
Christmas trading period showed an annual fall of 2.3 per cent, bringing
warnings that profits at the supermarket chain will not grow as 
expected and wiping almost £5billion off the share price.

By
contrast, budget chains such as Aldi continue to grow more quickly than
any other, with new store openings and a surge in sales of around 20 
per cent a year.

Pugh's take on Tesco's tailored marketing

The Grocer said: ‘Tesco has begun talks 
with suppliers aimed at launching price promotions in less well-off 
areas where it is facing competition from the likes of Aldi and Lidl.’

One supplier said: ‘It has a list of about 100 stores where it is going to launch special deals at discount prices. We will work with them, although we will be very concerned if they try to pass on the cost.’

At the same time another 200 stores in affluent areas have been highlighted for promotions on more upmarket ranges and products.

One retail industry analyst said: ‘It’s a very clever idea and a much more strategic approach being taken by Tesco, unlike the “Big Price Drop”, which came across as very knee-jerk.

‘Richard Brasher has been saying that affluence is the new format.’

Tesco refused to comment on any upcoming strategy.

A spokesman said: ‘We are not considering dual pricing. We cannot make any comment beyond that. We already have different ranges in different stores.’
