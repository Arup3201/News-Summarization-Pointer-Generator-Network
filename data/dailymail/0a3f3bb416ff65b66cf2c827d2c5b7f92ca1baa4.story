Actor Jack Klugman, who died aged 90 on Christmas Eve, was well-loved by millions across the world for his role as the principled, thorough medical examiner star of hit TV show Quincy, ME.

But he was also the last of the actors who portrayed the dozen jurors from the seminal Hollywood classic 12 Angry Men.

The thriller dramatically chronicles 12 New Yorker's deliberations as they decide the guilt of a young Puerto Rican man accused of murdering his father.

It wrestles with issues like morality, racism and the legal concept of reasonable doubt.

Hollywood classic: Klugman was last of the actors who portrayed the 12 Angry Men to die. The film brought together a dozen renowned stage and screen actors, a sparkling script and a visionary director. Pictured: Martin Balsam (Juror 1), John Fiedler (Juror 2), Lee J. Cobb (Juror 3), E G Marshall (Juror 4), Jack Klugman (Juror 5), Edward Binns (Juror 6), Jack Warden (Juror 7), Henry Fonda (Juror 8), Joseph Sweeney (Juror 9), Ed Begley (Juror 10), George Voskovec (Juror 11), Robert Webber (Juror 12)

Classic: Klugman (centre) with Henry Fonda (left) in 12 Angry Men from 1957. As well as being a thrilling drama, it says many important things about justice, anger, revenge and prejudice

Klugman portrays juror number 5 - none of the 12 men are named in the film except two at the very end - whose slum upbringing gives him an insight into the case that none of the other men have.

He starred alongside acting heavyweights and Oscar winners such as Henry Fonda, Martin Balsam and Ed Begley.

It was the first film directed by Sidney Lumet, who went on to direct a string of hit films, including Dog Day Afternoon, Network and Before the Devil Knows You're Dead.

Acclaim: 12 Angry Men is widely-regarded as one of the finest films ever made. Five years ago it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry because it is 'culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant'

Seminal: Production still taken during the filming of an episode of the television anthology series 'Studio One,' called 'Twelve Angry Men,' in 1954. The episode was later remade into the feature film

In 2007, 12 Angry Men, which was adapted from a play, was selected for 
preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library 
of Congress as being 'culturally, historically, or aesthetically 
significant'.

Last year a media education charity revealed that it was the second most-screened film in schools after Bugsy Malone.

Klugman was also known for starring in 
1970s sitcom The Odd Couple as Oscar Madison. Over the course of the 
show's five-year run, Klugman won two Primetime Emmy Awards for his work
on the series. The series ended in 1975.

Only the first five of these were Czech; the rest were American or British.Robert Webber (Juror 12). Died 1989. Appeared with Dudley Moore in '10' and as a general in 'The Dirty Dozen'.

The star reportedly died peacefully at home with his wife Peggy by his side.

His son Adam said: 'He had a great life and he enjoyed every moment of it and he would encourage others to do the same.'

Jack is also survived by son David, who Adam said he would be spending the holidays with, along with their respective families.

'His sons loved him very much,' David said. 'We'll carry on in his spirit.'

Their father had been convalescing for some time but had apparently died suddenly and they were not sure of the exact cause.

Jack was diagnosed with throat cancer
in 1974 and lost his voice in the 1980s as a result, but the late actor
trained himself to speak again.

He returned to acting with a role on Broadway in 1993's Three Men on a Horse.

Brave: Jack, pictured in October 2010, lost his voice in the 1980s after he was diagnosed with throat cancer but trained himself to speak again

He proved them wrong: Jack once stated that everybody said Quincy, M.E. would 'never be a hit'

Quincy, ME is credited as being the first 'police procedural' show, inspiring programmes like CSI.

He once said: 'Everybody said, "Quincy'll never be a
hit." I said, "You guys are wrong. He's two heroes in one, a cop and a 
doctor." A coroner has power.

'He can tell the police commissioner to 
investigate a murder. I saw the opportunity to do what I'd gotten into 
the theater to do -- give a message.

'"They were going to do cops and 
robbers with Quincy." I said, "You promised me I could do causes."

They 
said, "Nobody wants to see that." I said, "Look at the success of 60 
Minutes. They want to see it if you present it as entertainment.'"
