And the ex-Panathinaikos, Inter Milan and Benfica star will be hoping he can inspire the next generation of players during their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign.

They suffered defeat in their Group F opener against Romania earlier this month and will look to get back on track when they host Northern Ireland in October. 

Karagounis called time on his international career after the World Cup but it remains unclear whether he plans to continue playing. He recently expressed an interest in rejoining Fulham following Felix Magath's dismissal.
