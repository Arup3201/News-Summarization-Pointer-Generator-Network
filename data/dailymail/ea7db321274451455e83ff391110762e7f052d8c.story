An independent Scotland could open its doors to a huge influx of immigrants who would fill a city the size of Edinburgh, Treasury chiefs have claimed.

The UK Government’s most detailed report to date on the seismic impact of a Yes vote will be published next week, which includes an in-depth analysis of demographic changes.

A separate Scotland’s weaker fiscal position would mean a rapidly ageing population would have to be countered by a massive rise in foreign workers – a policy endorsed by the SNP.

Strategy: Alex Salmond wants to lift restrictions on non-EU immigration if he wins the referendum

Over the 20 years from the first year of independence in 2016, Whitehall chiefs have calculated that net migration – the difference between those leaving and those arriving on these shores – would have to increase at an annual rate of 24,000.

By 2035-36, that would take the total to an eye-watering 480,000 – a near  9 per cent rise on Scotland’s current population, placing unprecedented strain on health services and housing.

The alternative would be to increase taxes or slash public spending to ensure the government could afford services for the growing number of elderly pensioners.

Next week’s paper – set to be launched in Scotland by Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander – is being billed as one of the most extensive financial analyses since the last Labour Government examined, and rejected, joining the euro.

Top civil servants using independently-verified modelling have been working on the project for months, and aim to produce a definitive figure of the ‘Union dividend’ for every Scots family. Their five main findings are:

Scotland’s OAP population will rise from 1.04million in 2010 to 1.49million in 2066.

But the working age population is only expected to increase from 3.3million to 3.6million.

That will create a ‘dependency ratio’ of 2.41 workers for every pensioner, compared to 2.64 in other parts of the UK.

Analysis: Danny Alexander

Alex Salmond’s proposed solution is to lift restrictions on non-EU immigration if he wins the referendum, bringing in more workers from abroad.

But despite repeated requests for precise estimates, the Scottish Government has so far failed to produce detailed information.

A senior Treasury source said next week’s paper has modelled a ‘high migration’ scenario, which could reduce the dependency ratio to the same as the UK’s if there is not a similar influx south of the Border. ‘To get the demographics simply to match the UK, Scotland would have to go up to the “high migration scenario”, which is 24,000 people a year net, so that’s more than tripling in migration relative to Scotland within the UK,’ the source said.

‘Over the 20-year period that we looked at that would basically be the equivalent of adding the population of Edinburgh to the Scottish population.’

Alex Johnstone, Scottish Tory spokesman for transport, infrastructure and  climate change, said: ‘Migrant workers play a vital role in Scotland’s economy, and many of our successful businesses would not be able to cope without them.

‘But under the SNP’s hare-brained separation plans, we would need an open-door approach just to have a fighting chance of balancing the books. That would require a different immigration policy to the rest of the UK, which would without question mean border controls were an absolute necessity.

‘Not only would that be divisive and inconvenient, it would harm the Scottish economy, which is why breaking up Britain is such a bad idea.’

Scottish Labour’s pensions spokesman Gregg McClymont added: ‘Pooling and sharing our resources across the whole of the UK means pensions are more affordable in Scotland. Only separation puts the pensions of Scots at risk.’

He added: ‘Alex Salmond needs to come clean about how much extra immigration would be needed to pay for pensions in a separate Scotland.’

A record 248,000 immigrants are already living in Scotland after an influx of migrants from Eastern Europe. The total number of people living in Scotland, but born outside the UK, now stands at 7 per cent of the population.

But Mr Salmond plans to go far beyond official projections that Scotland will be home to 9,000 more foreigners every year by relaxing rules on minimum salary levels for entry.

A spokesman for Finance Secretary John Swinney said: ‘Scotland is one of the wealthiest countries in the world, more prosperous per head than the UK, France and Japan – but we need the powers of independence to ensure that wealth properly benefits everyone in our society.

‘On immigration, net migration to Scotland is already more than 10,000 a year, and independence will allow us to have a flexible policy to suit our economic needs.’

He added: ‘It is deeply revealing, but not surprising, that the Treasury’s main attack on independence plays the immigration card, as the Westminster establishment panders to a Ukip agenda.’
