The number of nurses from the European Union allowed to work in Britain has doubled in just four years, raising fears of patients being put at risk due to language issues.

There are now 20,914 registered to practise in hospitals and care homes, compared with 10,244 in 2010.

But EU laws mean the nursing watchdog is banned from testing their command of the English language or their medical competence before giving them a licence to work because it is deemed to threaten ‘freedom of movement’.

Patients' groups are warning that an influx of nurses from Europe is threatening patient safety because EU rules do not allow hospitals to test their grasp of English before hiring them

Leading doctors have warned that the poor communication skills of some EU nurses is putting patients in danger, and say their skills are not up to the same standard of British-trained colleagues.

Separately, the Nursing and Midwifery Council, the regulator of standards, last night announced it was relaxing the rules on nurses from outside the EU coming to work in Britain.

At present non-EU nurses must prove their English is of a high enough standard before going on a course of up to 12 months at university which includes supervised work on a ward or in a care home.

The NMC is replacing the course with a single test – half of which includes an online, multiple-choice quiz – to enable hospitals to recruit more quickly.

The watchdog insisted the test would be rigorous, but patient groups warned that it was a major step backwards that would put patients at risk.

Over the past year many hospitals have been desperately recruiting nurses from abroad to fill understaffed wards. This was partly fuelled by a report into the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal, in which hundreds of patients died due to poor care, that warned many hospitals had too few nurses.

Latest figures from the NMC show that in 2013-14, some 5,388 nurses from the EU joined its register, up from 3,436 the previous year – and the 2,715 who joined in 2011.

As it is unable to carry out its own tests on EU nurses, the NMC has urged hospitals, care homes and GP surgeries to carry out checks on individuals before employing them. But most do not.

A survey in June of more than 100 senior NHS managers found that 52 per cent did not normally use aptitude tests when recruiting nurses from the Continent.

The poll also revealed that 54 per cent of Health Service bosses planned to recruit nurses from overseas, mainly Spain, Portugal, Greece and Italy.

NHS Trusts have been desperately recruiting nurses from overseas in the wake of the Mid Staffordshire scandal, when hospitals were criticised for not having enough nurses

Roger Goss, from Patient Concern, said the increase in EU nurses was ‘really alarming’. He added: ‘It seems we just aren’t training enough of our own nurses. We ought not to have this reliance on workers coming here from overseas.

‘Again and again we have seen concerns about the communication skills of these workers, and communication is absolutely critical when it comes to healthcare.’

On the relaxing of rules for nurses from non-EU nations, he said: ‘This is ludicrous. They are just doing whatever is expedient to fill posts.

‘However good a nurse is, if they have trained abroad they may well not be familiar with the systems here and the drugs we use. This is a major step backwards for patient safety. It’s as if the Mid Staffs scandal passed the NMC by.’

Janet Davies, an executive director at the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘Too often, nurses are recruited from overseas to fill short-term gaps and given inadequate support to care for patients well.’

One senior NHS official, who works in the North of England, said there were concerns that the lack of checks would ‘put patients at risk’.

Speaking on condition of anonymity, he told the Mirror newspaper: ‘Without a period of supervision, there is absolutely no way you can tell whether they are actually capable of delivering safe care.’

Jackie Smith, chief executive of the NMC, insisted the new test for non-EU nurses was ‘internationally recognised’ and ‘rigorous’.

It would ensure that they were ‘able to practise safely and effectively in the UK’, she added.
