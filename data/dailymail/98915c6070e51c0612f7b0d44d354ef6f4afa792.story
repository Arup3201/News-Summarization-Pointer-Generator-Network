The towns with the most banned drivers in Britain have today been revealed - and top of the list is Smethwick in the West Midlands - which now has the unenviable title of being home to the worst motorists in the country.

Banned motorists made up 0.77 per cent of licence holders in the area in 2012, with 160 of the 20,194 motorists in the town disqualified, according to the latest statistics.

West Bromwich, also in the West 
Midlands, was a close second with 191 of the 26,101 motorists in the 
town banned from driving - roughly 0.73 per cent.

It
 tied with Barking in east London, where 164 out of 22,591 (0.73 per 
cent) were disqualified, said the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency.

The figures were compiled by motoring magazine Auto Express, which limited the data to towns or cities with at least 20,000 drivers, as ruled by the DVLA.

A variety of factors can make one area have more disqualified drivers than others - including the number of speed cameras, crackdowns by police and a nature of recklessness by motorists.

Harpenden in Hertfordshire has the most law-abiding drivers. Of the 23,347 motorists there, only 19 picked up a ban in 2012 - a tiny 0.08 per cent.

It was closely followed by Rayleigh in Essex, which had 20 out of 22,606 drivers disqualified in the same year, equivalent to 0.09 per cent.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, London was home to the highest total of disqualified drivers in 2012, at 9,336.

However, with almost 2.5 million drivers holding licences in the capital, the percentage banned is 0.37.

Other areas with higher percentages of banned drivers include Bradford, West Yorkshire, and Dagenham, London.

In total, 113, 646 drivers were banned in 2012 across England, Scotland and Wales. England made up the majority of these with 95,965, although it has the largest number of drivers at 32.7 million.

More than 10,000 of the 3.1 licence holders in Scotland were disqualified in 2012, while 7,400 drivers out of a possible 1.8 million in Wales were handed a ban.

It meant Wales was top of the bad driver league with 0.39 per cent, ahead of Scotland on 0.33 per cent and England at 0.29.
