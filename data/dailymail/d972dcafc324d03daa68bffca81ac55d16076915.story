This dog has a nose for drugs. In fact, it’s so sharp she can detect the smell of unlit marijuana from outside a closed vehicle.

That makes Roxie a big hit among concerned parents suspicious of drug use among their children.

The German Shepard with the keen sense of smell provides her drug-sniffing services in the Houston Texas area, where she and owner Kristen Maurer live.

Unlike police drug-sniffing dogs, Roxie is a ‘private nose’ with a client base of local families, the Today Show reports.

‘Roxie can find drugs in places that parents will never find,’ says Maurer.

One Houston mother who requested Roxie’s services says the pooch found marijuana in her garage.

That discovery led to a conversation that ‘turned her daughter around,’ she says.

In demand: Roxie's owner Kristen Maurer has a steady business providing drug-sniffing services to families, she says

While Roxie has her share of proponents, some argue that the use of drug-sniffing dogs in private homes is a step too far.

‘Looking for the drugs with a dog I think is an overkill,’ says child psychologist and Today Show contributor, Dr. Jeff Gardere.

‘What it comes down to is having a relationship and I don’t know if you can do that if you’re bringing in drug sniffing dogs.’

Too far: ¿Looking for the drugs with a dog is an overkill,¿ says child psychologist and Today Show contributor, Dr. Jeff Gardere

Nonetheless, there is a market for ‘private nose’ pooches.

Maurer and others who run private drug-sniffing operations tell the Today Show that they have steady businesses going.
