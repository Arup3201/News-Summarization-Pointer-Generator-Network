The Bad Santa’s Christmas sack is coming but this year it is not only the usual suspects who are feeling the big chill.

By seasonal custom it is the humble basement bosses in the Premier League who check whether their P45s come through the letter box with the greetings cards.

Now, if not facing festive dismissal quite yet, one or two of the big boys are beginning to sense that the skids could be under them.

Europe is the destination of choice for the major clubs but when Champions League matches go the way they have in the past few days these can be perilous journeys for the managers.

Who would have thought, as recently as a week ago, that Manuel Pellegrini, Arsene Wenger and Brendan Rodgers would be planning extra helpings not of turkey and Christmas pudding but hard tack.

Let us consider them in turn:

SENOR PELLEGRINI spent the latter part of this Wednesday evening confessing that his costly Manchester City have lost nerve, faith, confidence and, potentially most damaging of all for himself, trust.

Just one win in five matches speaks to the truth of that self-wounding assessment and had that solitary victory not come against Manchester United then Pellegrini would be on even slipperier ground already.

How far have the English champions fallen? As low as losing at home to a distinctly ordinary CSKA Moscow and having two of their prima donnas sent off during that humiliating process.

Pellegrini answers to foreign owners who regard the Champions League as the Holy Grail.

City’s prospects of surviving a relatively easy group depend now on Bayern Munich, who have already qualified, either sending their reserves to the Etihad or treating that fixture as a practice match.

Feliz Navidad, Manuel.

MONSIEUR WENGER whiled away his Tuesday evening watching Arsenal throw away a three-goal lead at home against the Belgian lightweights of Anderlecht. The boos rained down in North London as he turned away from the scene of that debacle.

The fans, let alone the directors, can see that this team are, quite literally, defenceless. Even the most respectful of former players are beginning to query why the manager has not bought top-class centre-backs.

It looked as if Arsene Wenger would have an easy night when Arsenal went 3-0 up against Anderlecht...

But the Arsenal manager could hardly look as his side threw away their three-goal lead at the Emirates

That question would be asked with greater urgency right now if Arsenal were not still in position to go through to the last 16. For the moment, it is being conveniently forgotten that Wenger’s esoteric ensemble would be scrambling to advance had they not been fortunate enough to pull a last-gasp victory out of a wretched performance at Anderlecht in the preceding match.

As it is they are looking at second place, yet again, with its implicit danger of a deadly draw in the next round. And, like City, they have not started the Premier League season at all well.

The Arsenal board are historically patient and respectful of Wenger, who achieved so much in his early years there. But for how much longer?

Joyeux Noel, Arsene.

MISTER RODGERS, meanwhile, splashed through only the first half of his sudden watershed on Tuesday. By scorning the highest European tradition with his decision to send a weakened Liverpool team into Real Madrid’s fabled Bernabeu, this manager has impaled himself on the imperative of his rested first-teamers defeating Chelsea at Anfield this weekend. Or at least avoiding defeat.

If Liverpool lose this one – and slump even further adrift of the Premier League leaders – the carrion will make a meal of Rodgers come Saturday lunchtime.

Brendan Rodgers made seven changes to the Liverpool side he sent out to face Real Madrid

If so, that feast will come early. Rodgers was so recently hailed as the saviour of Anfield that a descent into doubt this soon seemed impossible. He is bringing it in part upon himself.

Far be it from a sportswriter to advise a manager to turn off the quotes tap but Rodgers really needs to put thinking time between brain and mouth.

As an example of his tendency to damage himself, how about this cracker at the dinner in May at which the Uruguayan Dracula of the game was dubiously installed as our Footballer of the Year: ‘I am a better person for knowing Luis Suarez.’

In the end Rodgers and Liverpool only lost to the European champions by one goal

Nor, judging from his jocular appearance at subsequent training, does he understand even now the implications of a club of Liverpool’s European pedigree playing for damage limitation rather than glory at the Bernabeu.

Among the chorus of disapproval, one Anfield legend asked: ‘What is the point of making qualification for next season’s Champions League the priority when you are playing Real Madrid this week?’

Rodgers, in training with Glen Johnson, appeared to be over the Madrid defeat at training on Thursday morning

That is not a question which will sit comfortably on his CV if ever he tries to pursue his professed ambition to manage in the upper echelons of La Liga. Worse still if Liverpool go out to – er - Basle.

Merry Christmas, Brendan.

Despite being held to a draw in Slovenia by the moderates of Maribor, Chelsea’s Jose Mourinho is iceberg proof this winter. Not only is he virtually certain of reaching the Champions League last 16 but Chelsea are top of the Premier League.

Jose Mourinho is sitting pretty in Europe despite a midweek draw and his team are flying high in the league

However, the English game at large needs higher quality performances from Chelsea as much as from City, Arsenal and Liverpool... and Manchester United for that matter.

This Champions League week – and not for the first time - has not cast the Premier League in a flattering light.

The best league in the world?

Not even close unless the marquee clubs raise their game considerably, starting this weekend with Liverpool and Chelsea putting on a spectacle, Manchester City and United dazzling QPR and Crystal Palace respectively and Arsenal grafting substance onto style at Swansea.
