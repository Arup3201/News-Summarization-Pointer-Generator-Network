Jeremy Smith, 45, from London, raped a woman in a swingers' club in Sheffield during a Halloween party

A cabaret performer has been jailed for five years after raping a woman in a swingers' club while dressed as Herman Munster.

Jeremy Smith, 45, was part of a male cabaret team performing at a Halloween party at La Chambre in Attercliffe, Sheffield, when he attacked the woman in a room of mirrors.

The married father, who admitted taking Viagra, was dressed as the character from The Munsters while his two friends were dressed as Harry Potter and Herman's wife in drag. 

Jailing Smith at Sheffield Crown Court today, Judge Peter Kelson QC said the defendant had behaved 'shockingly'.

He said: 'Having taken drink yourself, you behaved shockingly.

'This is a crime which leaves the victim nothing else then devastated, and she was surely devastated.'

The 22-year-old victim, who was at the club with two friends, said she only went to the club to socialise and never indulged in sexual activities. 

But the court heard that, after meeting her that night, Smith - formerly of Tingley, Wakefield who now lives in London - plied the woman with alcohol.

He then raped the woman in an indoor smoking room which was 'covered in mirrors', the court was told.

It meant his victim was forced to watch every moment of the terrifying ordeal. 

Kama Melly, mitigating, told the court it was 'the toxic combination of being in a place where sexuality, and sex itself, was paraded in front of him' that led Smith to commit the offence. 

Prosecutor Charlotte Baines previously told the court that La Chambre was a private members' club, commonly known as a swingers' club.

She said: 'It opens its doors to members with a view to them watching or participating in sexual activity, if they wish to do so.

'Upstairs in this club there are rooms commonly known as 'play rooms' for individuals who want to engage in sexual activity. The defendant was there with two friends performing a cabaret act.

'He was dressed as Herman Munster, known as the Frankenstein monster, while (a friend) was dressed in drag as Lily Munster, and (another friend) was dressed as Harry Potter.'

Miss Baines said the defendant had asked the woman to go with him upstairs. 

The victim's and defendant's friends chatted upstairs throughout the evening, during which she told her friends: 'I think he's going to try something with me'. 

The married father, who admitted taking Viagra, was dressed as a Herman Munster for the event, Sheffield Crown Court was told 

Miss Baines said: 'As they all left down the stairs, the defendant and the complainant were at the back of the group.

'The defendant put his arm across the stairs on the stairwell to stop her and indicated to her he wanted to go for a cigarette.

'She told him she didn't smoke but didn't want to kick up a fuss. The two went to an indoor smoking area in the club, which is an open air room in the club were people are permitted to smoke.' 

Miss Baines told the jury the defendant began to kiss the girl in the room, before sexually assaulting her and keeping her underwear 'to look after it for her'.

In a video given as evidence in court, the woman told police: 'I just felt as though I was paralysed. I was so scared I didn't even know what to do. I knew what was going to happen.' 

The victim described how the defendant began to touch her and raped her.

She said: 'He started having sex with me. I could see everything that was happening. I tried to look away but the walls were covered in mirrors so I had to watch everything.' 

The married father was performing alongside two other men dressed as Harry Potter in La Chambre, Sheffield, when he attacked the woman who was in fancy dress

The attack took place in a mirror-covered room.  The court heard it was 'the toxic combination of being in a place where sexuality, and sex itself, was paraded in front of him' that led Smith to rape the woman

The woman told police how she wanted her friends to come back and find her, which they later did.

She went on: 'Just because of where it was it doesn't mean that gave him the right to do that to me.

'I didn't give him any indication I wanted to have sex with him that night. He shouldn't get away with what he's done.'

The victim told the police that, as she was being raped, she thought: 'He was really, really tall and big in his platform soles. I thought My God where are my friends.'

After the ordeal, the victim locked herself in a toilet and complained to management. Smith was later arrested.

During the trial, Smith had claimed that any sexual activity was consensual. He said the woman had been flirting with him and they were getting on well.  

But a jury found him guilty of rape after nearly seven hours of deliberations. He was also ordered to sign the Sex Offenders' Register.

After the trial, investigating officer PC Jessica Hawley, of South Yorkshire Police, said: 'South Yorkshire Police takes all reports of rape extremely seriously and will work tirelessly to bring offenders to justice.

'Smith denied the offence and forced his victim to relive her ordeal in court, which must have been incredibly hard for her.

'I would like to praise her for the tremendous courage and dignity she has shown during the investigation and court case.

'This man is now rightly starting a lengthy prison term and I hope today's sentencing allows the victim to move forward with her life.'
