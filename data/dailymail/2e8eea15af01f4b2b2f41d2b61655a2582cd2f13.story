Hosting a soiree this New Year's Eve?

Start with Prosecco, move on to gin or vodka, toast 2015 in with Champagne and round the celebrations off with a classic Martini.

But avoid beer, red wine and shots if you want to last the night and still be liked by your friends the morning after.

Happy New Year's! If you're hosting a party, steer clear of beer, red wine and shots and stick to Champagne

Then kickstart your 2015 with a spicy Bloody Mary (or Virgin Mary if you’re feeling virtuous).

‘If you’re having dinner first, a lovely festive twist on the most classic of aperitifs, is the Negroni Sbagliato,’ Ruairi Giles, owner of The Bonneville French restaurant and cocktail bar in Hackney advises.

‘This version (recipe below) omits the gin, which you might want to save for later in the evening, and replaces it with Prosecco or Champagne.

‘Even if you’re not having dinner, this is a safe drink to kick the night off that won’t get you too inebriated early on in the evening.

‘To continue the evening, I’d stick to long drinks for now. Otherwise come midnight, you’ll be the one sleeping it off in the corner while your friends ring in the New Year.'

And while a G&T  may not be the most adventurous of drinks, it will help you keep the pace.

A clean, classic and cold drink like a Martini is the perfect way to end a New Year's Eve Party

‘Sticking to the clear sprits will save you a world of pain the morning after. G&Ts or V&Ts are a safe bet. 

'They may not be exciting but they’ll help you play the long game. Add some angostura bitters to jazz up a G&T.’

More complicated cocktails, he said, are best saved for the later part of the evening.

‘My go to cocktail is always the Clover Club (recipe below), simple, super tasty and very drinkable or for something with a fizz, The Twinkle (recipe below) is a punchy but tasty combination of vodka, elderflower and Prosecco or Champagne.’

At midnight, Mr Giles recommends opting for bubbly made only with Chardonnay grapes.

‘Come the stroke of midnight, Champagne is obligatory,’ he said.

‘What you drink will be based on your budget, but I find a decent blanc de blanc - Champagne made with only Chardonnay grapes - to be preferable on a long evening rather than the very dry brut Champagnes, which tend to dry out your mouth, giving you "Champagne breath", which is not a sexy as it sounds, and always lead to a killer hangover.’

And while the natural choice to end the night would be a good Scotch or an old fashioned, he advises steering clear of darker spirits.

‘It’s entirely up to you,’ he said, ‘but remember the darker spirits are the ones that hurt more the day after, and if the night is still young, these will send you off too early.’

‘Go for a classic Martini (recipe below) if you're looking for something with a bit more kick. Clean, classic and cold.’

The Twinkle is a vodka cocktail topped with bubbly

Negroni Sbagliato

Ingredients: equal parts Campari, sweet vermouth and sparkling wine, ice, orange slice.

Method: Pour the ingredients into a cocktail shaker with ice cubes.Shake vigorously (more than normal to properly mix the egg and sugar). Strain into a chilled cocktail glass

Method: Juice the lemon and put all the ingredients in a blender and blend. Add a litre of Worcestershire sauce, cover and leave in the fridge for at least 24hrs.
