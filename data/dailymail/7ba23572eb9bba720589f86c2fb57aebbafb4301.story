Southampton have rejected a £3million bid from Cardiff for defender Jose Fonte.

Saints have already sold Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw and Rickie Lambert this summer and are not keen on selling any more of their stars until new manager Ronald Koeman has settled in.

Fonte moved to St Mary's from Crystal Palace in 2010 and has helped the south coast club rise from League One to the Premier League.

Getting forward: Fonte scores against Hull in the Premier League last season

He made 36 top-flight appearances last season and Bluebirds boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer sees him as the perfect man to help his side bounce back from relegation.

Cardiff could be without Steven Caulker next season after QPR manager Harry Redknapp confirmed that his club have agreed a fee for the England international.

Fonte's defensive partner, Dejan Lovren, is also in demand after Southampton rejected a second bid of £15million plus add-ons from Liverpool.
