Russian prosecutors are examining shocking footage of a football coach kicking a seven-year-old boy in the air during a training session.

Valentin Pavlov claimed he was teaching Eugene Efimov how to kick the ball properly after the lad failed to show enough commitment in a tackle.

He then ordered the frightened child to get back into the game.

The Moscow Football Federation has branded the training drill incident 'outrageous'

The powerful Investigative Committee, equivalent of the FBI, is deciding whether to bring charges for cruelty against Pavlov, but the coach claims his kick looked worse than it was.

The Moscow Football Federation branded the incident 'outrageous'.

'I was explaining to the child how to use his foot in a more robust manner,' claimed the coach, who claimed the camera was at the wrong angle.

'I started showing him - and just then the child jumped. So I sort of touched him, and he flipped in the air.

'Of course, there was not even a slightest intention to hurt him. This is a coincidence.

'He fell down in a theatrical manner so that it looked like he was hurt. The person who filmed it was lucky to catch this angle.'

Pavlov is the father of two daughters, one of whom plays in his team, and he claimed he filmed his club Maximum-Brateevo's training sessions as proof there was no undue physical force or beating of children.

While he did not apologise to the Eugene Efimov after the kick, he claims he has done so since.

But after the video went viral, the youngster's mother Alyona Efimova, 35, was tracked down and she refused to criticise the coach.

She said: 'I was at the match and watching the game, and it was just part of the game. The video doesn't show anything really special, my son has been training for football with this coach for three years and we haven't had any problems up until now, and I still don't see a problem.'

The video however has underlined a tough attitude that many parents in Russia have to raising children, where violence from parents or teachers is still often regarded as acceptable as a way of making sure they grow up properly.

Asked if he was angry at the kick, the boy told local TV: 'No. I am not mad at him, I fell down because I jumped, I didn't feel any pain, it just looked bad.' 

While the footage has caused outrage in Russia, without a complaint, the Investigative Committee may not take further action.
