The widow of church organist Alan Greaves who was murdered as he walked to Midnight Mass has been attacked and punched by a female mugger.

Maureen Greaves, aged 64, whose husband was beaten to death on Christmas Eve on his way to church, was shopping near her home when the woman tried to grab her handbag and demanded cash.

But when the grandmother refused to leg go of the bag, the attacker punched Mrs Greaves in the face with such force it knocked off her glasses.

Now the devout Christian, who spoke last month of her forgiveness for the two killers of her devoted husband, is recovering at her home.

But she spoke of the terrifying ordeal that brought back memories of the senseless attack on her 68-year-old husband, close to their home in High Green, Sheffield.

she said: 'It was very frightening, The worst thing was that it made me imagine Alan being attacked and what he was feeling.

'A woman just came up to me and started touching my bag.

'Then she said: “I want some money’.

'I started to walk away and I felt her pull hard on my bag. I said to her "I can talk to you about where you can get some food", but she came right up to my face and started swearing. She was really angry.

'She was pushing me towards the road, so I put my hand on her shoulder and she just walloped me.'

Mrs Greaves was with her son Peter, who stepped in and stood between the woman and Mrs Greaves.

He and his mother then walked quickly away from the woman who then headed for a taxi rank.

Mrs Greaves was left with marks and bruising to her face and a scratch on her nose.

She said: 'She was very violent. If I had been 80-years-old I wouldn’t have been able to defend myself and she could have really shocked and scared me.'

She revealed that the attack on Bruncross Road, Chapeltown, three miles from her home, happened four days before she attended the the trial of two men accused of killing her husband last month.

The two men Jonathan Bowling,22 and Ashley Foster 22, were jailed by a judge at Sheffield Crown Court.

Police have since arrested a 24-year-old woman on suspicion of assault and attempted robbery.

Mrs Greaves, a Church Army evangelist, said after the trial that she forgave her husband’s killers and was unsure whether to press for prosecution of her alleged attacker.

She added: 'I want the police to find out more about her background before it goes any further. I’ve been told she may have mental health problems, so I want them to look into that and make sure she is being monitored.

'If she is mentally ill, we can take a course of action which is best for her. The aim is to stop her doing it again.'

She says her husband used to warn her about the dangers on the street and told her to take care when she was out and about.

She added: 'Alan often told me to walk with someone I knew and to be careful. It is so ironic it was Alan who was attacked and killed.'

A South Yorkshire Police spokeswoman said: 'A file regarding the woman has been passed to the Crown Prosecution Service for consideration pending psychiatric reports.'

Mr Greaves was brutally beaten in the motiveless attack on Christmas Eve as he walked to church to play the organ at midnight mass. He died later in hospital.

Last month Jonathan Bowling,22 admitted murder and was ordered to serve a minimum of 25 years in prison.

Ashley Foster, 22, who was found not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter, was sentenced to nine years .
