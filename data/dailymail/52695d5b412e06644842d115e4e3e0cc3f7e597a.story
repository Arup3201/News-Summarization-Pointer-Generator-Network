Scores of actors descended upon the quiet market town of Kirkby Lonsdale, in Cumbria, as filming for the BBC's adaptation of Daphne Du Maurier's classic novel Jamaica Inn took place.

The sleepy town was transformed from its 21st century norm to an eerie 1820s back-drop, against which Downton Abbey star Jessica Brown Findlay led the cast in a production directed by BAFTA-winner Philippa Lowthorpe.

Set against the windswept Cornish Moors, Du Maurier's Jamaica Inn follows the journey of Mary Yellan, a young girl who falls into a life of crime after being sent to live with her aunt when her mother dies.

The quiet market town between the Lake District and Yorkshire has been transformed into the eerie, 1820s Cornish village featured in the book originally

The town on the River Lune was chosen as one of three settings for the drama as Launceston in Cornwall, the story's original setting, has become too modern

Back to reality: Kirkby Lonsdale Market Square on a normal day. The square hosts a weekly market in support of local merchants who sell food, flowers and plants

St Mary's Church was also used during filming which took place earlier this month over one week. Local residents expressed their surprise at how 'smooth' the transformation had been

The original story is set in the Cornish town of Launceston however producers decided the area had become too modern to offer a realistic backdrop to the drama

The three-part drama will be filmed in two other locations, with shooting arranged in Cornwall and Yorkshire as well.

Jamaica Inn is the story of young Mary Yellan who is forced to move in with her Aunt Patience after her mother dies.

When Mary arrives in Launceston she discovers her aunt living under the rule of her husband, Joss Merlyn, who is the crooked keeper of Jamaica Inn.

With no guests and locked rooms, the inn soon reveals itself as a hub of illegal activity.

Mary quickly falls into a life of crime, joining the group of wreckers led by Joss and his brother, Jem, who run ships aground and murder sailors to steal their loot.

Against her better judgement she develops feelings for Jem, a penny thief whose crimes are less severe than his older brother's.

After several attempts to expose Joss as the criminal he is, Mary discovers him alongside her Aunt Patience who have been stabbed to death.

She returns to her native Helford, but flees one day after seeing her beloved Jem walking across the moors with all his possessions.

The story was originally set in the Cornish town of Launceston, but, as its town centre has become too modern looking, the more historical Kirkby Lonsdale was chosen instead, reports the Westmorland Gazette.

Before filming begin in earnest, Origin Pictures issued a statement to residents that said: 'Some shops may look different during this time but behind their doors will be continuing as normal.’

'We hope you will find our work interesting and apologise in advance for any inconvenience.'

The town's quaint market square was turned into a 19th century horse traders yard on the second day of filming, while scenes were also shot near St Mary's Church.

Members of the small community seemed more than happy to accommodate the programme's crew, posting updates of the filming's progress on kirkbylonsdale.co.uk.

In a post titled 'Cornwall comes to Cumbria!', residents welcome tourists to visit the historic town during the exciting time.

'The rest of the town remains firmly in the 21st Century, so there are plenty of shops and eating places to provide for visitors.

'Why not take a trip back in time during the next few days while this part of Cumbria becomes Cornwall?' it read.

Later posts reveal the residents who were taking part in the filming as extras were reminded to keep mobile phones on silent or switched off, and told to refrain from flash photography.

'The streets were lined with spectators busily taking snapshots at every opportunity. Because of the low light levels the director asked us to make sure our flashes were off, and not forgetting to remind us to make sure our mobles were on silent too.

'The logisitcs involved in transfroming our dear town must've been a monumental task and I can only say how impressed I have been with the smooth running of the whole process

The production's writer, Emma Frost, said: 'I love Daphne du Maurier’s novels and it’s been a lifelong dream to 
adapt Jamaica Inn.

'I hope I have done justice to this wonderful tale of 
morality, survival and desire.'

Speaking upon the announcement of the programme's cast, she said: 'It has been a pleasure and a privilege to
adapt it for the screen, and I'm tremendously excited to see how our 
talented cast and director bring the scripts to life.'

Filming is underway in the Cumbria town of Kirkby Lonsdale which is playing host to the actors and crew behind the BBC's latest drama, Jamaica Inn

It has been reported that local residents in the town, which has an estimated population of just 1,770, have joined in on the set as extras

House of Card star,  Ben Daniels,  joins the cast as Davey while Wimpole Street actress, Rhiannon Oliver,  takes on the role of Mrs Trelawn

The adaptation will be released as three thirty-minute programmes on BBC. Its creators are hopeful the drama will bring the tale to life for a younger generation

The drama tells the story of young Mary Yellan's plight into a life of crime and mystery after she moves to the town to live with her Aunt Patience

The novel which was written in 1936 has been made into a film and been performed on the stage numerous times

Director Philippa Lowthorpe of Call The Midwife added: 'I love Jamaica Inn because it is an exhilarating adventure story set in a
wild landscape with brilliant characters, and at its heart is Mary 
Yellan - a fantastic female heroine.

'I am delighted that Jessica Brown 
Findlay is going to play this bold and opinionated, courageous but naive
young woman, whose curiosity and fiery nature get her into big trouble.

'To have Jessica, along with such talented actors as Sean Harris, Joanne
Whalley and Matthew McNulty - it's my dream cast.'

Ben
Stephenson, Controller at BBC Drama Commissioning, said he was 
'confident this exciting young cast will bring the classic story to the 
screen for a whole new generation of audiences'.

The story, written in 1936, was first made into a film in 1939 by Alfred Hitchcock, starring Charles Laughton and Maureen O'Hara.

But reports at the time claimed Du Maurier was understandably unimpressed with the film version changing several aspects of the original tale.

In 1983 a TV adaptation was produced by ITV in the United Kingdom - featuring Jane Seymour, Trevor Eve, Billie Whitelaw and Patrick McGoohan.

Its first stage adaptation was performed in 1990 by David Horlock in the Salisbury Playhouse.

Latest adaptation: Jamaica Inn was first made into a film by Alfred Hitchcock in 1939, to the disdain of author Daphne Du Maurier, who believed the film strayed too much from the original plot

Taking a break: Some actors on the set of Jamaica Inn take a breather as filming continues. The drama will be shown in three sixty-minute episodes next year

Filming will also take place in Cornwall and Yorkshire, the BBC revealed upon announcing the drama's impressive cast late last month
