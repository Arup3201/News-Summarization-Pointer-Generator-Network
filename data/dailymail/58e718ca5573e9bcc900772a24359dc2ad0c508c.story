Floyd Mayweather Jr. is still undefeated in Las Vegas after he and rapper T.I. became embroiled in a huge melee which caused chaos at a city Fatburger on Saturday morning.

Two videos from that evening show chair's being thrown inside the burger joint while in another the 37-year-old Mayweather screams, presumably at T.I., for him to 'control your b****motherf*****'.

Witnesses to the brawl said that T.I. approached Mayweather while he was eating and began to verbally abuse him before he allegedly threw a punch at the undefeated eight-time world champion.

Fight: Floyd Mayweather and rapper T.I. got into a brawl at a Las Vegas Fatburger restaurant

Wild: Chairs were thrown during the altercation but both Mayweather and T.I. left before police arrived

Before the brawl: Delicia Cordon, Doralie Medina and Floyd Mayweather attend a Memorial Day Weekend Party in Las Vegas

Pound-for-pound chamion, Mayweather and the 33-year-old 'I'm Serious' rapper, whose real name is Clifford Harris, faced off after the hip-hop star's wife, Tameka aka Tiny, insulted the prize-fighter.

Both men's entourage's launched into furious fighting in Fatburger as the two multi-millionaire's squared-off.

Eventually, the Vegas police showed up, but by then, both T.I. and Mayweather left.

The world's greatest boxer left in a $1.8 million Limited Edition Grand Sport Bugatti, which he purchased last week after his $19 million fight with Marco Maidana, from which he emerged victorious.  

Calm before the storm: T.I. attended the LIQUID Pool Lounge at ARIA with fellow rapper Nicki Minaj shortly before the fight

Cause of concern: Lyanna Mayweather appeared in a picture with T.I.'s wife Tameka - which Tameka captioned up with the message that Lyanna was 'new boo'

All smiles: Mayweather pictured with TI's wife Tameka sometime before the fight broke out

According to TMZ, the fight was sparked by a photograph that T.I.'s wife Tameka posted to Instagram of herself and Floyd's daughter, Lyanna, writing the girl was her 'new boo.'

This apparently upset T.I., who felt that it was disrespectful and confronted Mayweather at the burger joint because of the photograph.

Mayweather will have his next fight on September 13, ruling out a potential meeting with Amir Khan.

Mayweather Promotions chief executive Leonard Ellerbe confirmed a to-be-determined opponent.

Khan, who impressed on the Mayweather undercard with an excellent win over Luis Collazo, is unable to fight in September because he observes Ramadan.

'Floyd will go on September 13 and we're looking at who he's going to fight and where he is going to fight,' Ellerbe told ESPN.

'Obviously, Las Vegas is his home and the MGM Grand is always the leading candidate but we will take a look at our other options.'
