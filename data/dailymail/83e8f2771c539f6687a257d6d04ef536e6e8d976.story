By the tender age of eight years old, Lachlan De Vries had lost both his parents to their devastating battles with depression.

His father John, 21, took his life when Lachlan was just two years old, and five years later his mother Richelle Turpin, 26, tragically did the same on the 9th of March, 2014.

Although the young boy has been orphaned by the tragedy mental illness imposed upon his life, he is now under the care of his late mother's loving fiance, Jeremy De Vries - who is in the process of adopting the young boy.

Elise Weller, Richelle's best friend, described her as bubbly, bright and infectious to be around

Richelle grew up in Bangor in the Sutherland Shire, about 40 kilometres south of Sydney.

Her best friend Elise Weller described her  as someone who would go above and beyond for the people in her life, and said everyone who knew her was shattered by her passing.

'She was always the life of the party, very bubbly, infectious smile, infectious to be around,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'She just wanted the best for everyone; she was a really beautiful person.'

Richelle is survived by her son, Lachlan, and the young boy had already taken his mother's fiance's name ahead of their wedding, which was meant to go ahead in December 2014. 

Now almost a year since her best friend's death, Elise has started a fundraiser 'to raise money for Lachlans future so it can be a bright one'.

Jeremy  is like a father to the eight-year-old, and the pair bonded immediately when they first met.

'Lachlan adores Jeremy and vice versa', Elise revealed.

Richelle, 26, passed away when her son Lachlan was just seven. Lachlan's father also took his own life when he was two years old

'Lachlan calls Jeremy dad, and honestly he’s such a beautiful person and for him to take on such a commitment and really, he’s not his biological father.'

Elise revealed that losing the woman she'd known since she was 14 was 'the hardest thing I've ever had to go through', and is now committed to raising awareness about mental illness in young people.

'Growing up we weren't exposed to mental health,' Elise told Daily Mail Australia.

'You’re not taught about it.

'I think it would be great if it was done in the education system… because there’s such a taboo with it there’s such a stigma,' she continued.

The woman said she was 'was always worried about her' and she knew something wasn't right, even when the two were growing up together as teenagers.

'I think that she was misdiagnosed as a teen and that early intervention and help wasn't available,' Elise said.

'When we were about 16 there was an incident with some Panadol… there were a few red flags.

Elise said there were some 'red flags' when the pair were growing up together, and she suspected Richelle (pictured) had been battling something for a long time

'When you’re growing up and going through those teenage years a lot of people think you’re just attention seeking,' she added.

But Elise also said that later in life she thought Richelle never healed from the trauma inflicted when Lachlan's father passed away.

'She found John at their family home at the time, and I don’t think she ever moved on with it. I think the grief hit her later on down the track,' Elise said.

'I think she carried a lot of guilt with her,' she revealed, before adding that the strain on her as a young single mother was immense.

Jeremy and Richelle got together in October 2012, news which Elise was delighted to hear.

'I remember her coming to me and telling me that she was speaking to this guy and funnily enough I've actually known Jeremy longer than I've known Richelle,' she revealed.

'I felt at ease because Jeremy is such a beautiful person.'

In October 2013 Richelle was diagnosed with PTSD, due to the grief she went through losing the father of her child, but things seemed to be on track for the 26-year-old.

Richelle was seeking professional help for her depression, and she and Jeremy were planning their wedding, their family and their future. But her death came as a shock to so many around her.

'Everything seemed to be on track, she had the house, she had the wedding planned,' Elise said.

'It really hurts my heart to know she was suffering as much as she was, and she couldn't say anything.

'I've never been so devastated in my life, it was a month before my wedding.

'Not having her there on my wedding day was really hard,' she continued.

The anniversary of Richelle's death is coming up next week, and Elise said she has taken the day off so she can celebrate the life of her best friend.

'I’m just going to go spend some time with her at the cemetery. I’m going to take some flowers, and a cake and I’m going to celebrate her life,' she revealed.

'I wish I could raise awareness not having to have lost my best friend, but I want to help others, even if it helps one more person.

'She would be so proud, she would be happy that other people are happy,' Elise said. 

Elise Weller has set up a fundraiser to help support Lachlan in years to come. To donate visit the Go Fund Me page here.
