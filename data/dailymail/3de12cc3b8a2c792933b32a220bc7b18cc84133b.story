Mr Mitchell appeared on This Morning talking about his return to the radio after his battle with alcohol 

For former BBC and ITN newsreader Ed Mitchell, alcohol is now something he associates with pain.

His fall from grace as a well-known newsreader, interviewing world leaders and working alongside Alastair Stewart and the late Carol Barnes, was a  public one.

At his peak he earned a salary of around £100,000, but ended up being sacked, declared bankrupt and forced to sleep rough.

But now he has started to rebuild his life - marrying the woman who he calls his 'golden soul' who brought him tea when he slept on a park bench, and returning to the airwaves after more than a decade.

The 61-year-old has secured a regular weekday slot on Share Radio, where he will be giving tips about banking and budgeting.

He had worked as a newsreader for 35 years, and in his 1980s heyday worked for ITN.

But he later struggled with alcoholism, leading to a decline that saw him struggling to leave the house at 7am without drinking wine first.

Appearing on This Morning he said: 'I very stubbornly thought I could carry on, that I could function as an alcoholic but it did actually break me.'

He admits at one point he felt like the alcohol had taken hold when he was sacked from CNBC.

He said: 'It's never a good idea to tell an editor that he can't run a television station and I thought then that things were getting bad. 

'I think also the awful dreadful torture of the night sweats and knowing that to commute to my job I was already having to drink half a bottle of wine just to get out onto the streets and head for the station. 

'That's a bit of a warning sign that it has got a grip.'

He said his wife at the time, Judy, tried hard to make him stop and his children told him to get a grip.

Mr Stewart was sacked by CNBC in 2000 and got divorced from his wife of 25 years in 2006.

A year later he was sleeping rough in East Sussex for four months.

He said he had almost lived with an optimistic view, that something in life would turn up.

But he added: 'I always thought friends would help me out, but what friends want an alcoholic sleeping on their sofa? I can understand that.'

Mr Mitchell ended up with debts of a quarter of a million and later had to be declared bankrupt - something he said people should be aware of the risk of. 

He added: 'It's only a matter of few wage slips and if you allow debt to creep up it can wreck lives, and it isn't that far away from any of us.'

Mr Mitchell went to The Priory for treatment for his alcoholism after he appeared in a documentary in 2008 

At one stage Mr Mitchell had 25 credit cards with limits of £15,000 and used one to pay the other for 15 years until his interest escalated to £4,000 a month, according to The People.

While he was sleeping rough Mr Mitchell met Mandy, who brought him cups of tea and sandwiches. 

He calls her his lifeline.

Eventually the pair started up a romance. And in 2008 he appeared in a documentary about his struggle made by his former colleague, the late Carol Barnes.

A man who he had previously interviewed saw the show and offered to pay for Mr Mitchell to be treated at the Priory. 

Mr Mitchell married Mandy Tines in 2012, after he said she was his 'lifeline' when he met her while homeless

After three years he had problems with alcohol again, but after four months he returned to rehab.

He has not drank since and married Mandy in 2012.

He added: 'I actually got to the point where the first mouthful was thrill but subsequently I know it's going to cause all manner of problems. I now associate alcohol with pain.'

Mr Mitchell will now present his radio show from 1pm until 5pm from Monday to Friday, and said it was 'absolutely wonderful to be back' as having a job made him feel he had meaning.  

Mrs Mitchell also appeared on the This Morning programme to wish her husband good luck and said 'I always knew that you had something special.'
