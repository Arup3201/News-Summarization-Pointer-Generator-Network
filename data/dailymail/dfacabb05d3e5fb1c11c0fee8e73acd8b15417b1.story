These fantastic shots show the city of Hong Kong in a beautiful new light.

Photographer Peter Stewart spent two years travelling between the city and his native Australia, taking the stunning images in an attempt to show off the beauty of the sprawling metropolis.

The 29-year-old only took up photography professionally in 2009 but quickly made the change from holiday snaps to travel photography.

Mr Stewart said: 'People have a viewpoint of Hong Kong as an ugly city and I wanted to show it in a different light.

'The purpose of images like these is to overwhelm the viewer as there is just too much to take in on first viewing.

'I love all the intricate details that make up a cityscape and my hope is that it grabs the viewers attention enough to want to explore it more in finer detail.

He added: 'There is simply just so much to see and document in Hong Kong that it can fill the niche for any photographer.

'All of these images were taken at night, when the city is at its most vibrant.

'Using a tripod allows me to shoot using a longer shutter speed at night so I can capture as much ambient light as I please - provided the city is playing fair that evening and not covered in fog.'

More than 7.1million people live in Hong Kong's 1,100sq km area. It has nearly 1,300 more people crammed in each sq km than London

Hong Kong has a reputation as a sprawling city, too cluttered to be particularly beautiful but the photographer wanted to show off its particular charms

The city's horizon is dominated by skyscrapers, lending an unusual geometric quality to these shots taken from high vantage points

Mr Stewart used a tripod to hold the camera steady, meaning he could use longer shutter speeds and suck in as much ambient light as possible

The photographer hopes his works are so intricate that viewers will want to take time to study them in greater detail
