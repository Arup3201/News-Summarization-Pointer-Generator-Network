A house nestled into the side of a cliff has taken one of Australia's most prestigious architecture awards.

Designed by architect Peter Stutchbury, the rural retreat that is The Invisible House was awarded Australian House of the Year for 2014 on Friday.

Built in a remote location overlooking the Melagong Valley in the Blue Mountains a few hours out of Sydney, the property was originally intended to house a filmmaker and painter.

The jury who crowned the house with the prestigious award praised the property it saying it was 'absolutely Australian' and described the home as magical and harmonious.

'There is something absolutely Australian about this project, not just its connection to an undeniably spectacular setting, but also its modesty, clarity, resourcefulness and consequential delight.'

'Being (another) rural retreat with a jaw-dropping view, this project needed to convince the jury that all the moves made to create it are in harmony with its location, and that it is a great piece of architecture in its own right, and this it has,' they said.

It blends in with the surrounding bushland but is shielded from the harsh elements

The Invisible House has a breathtaking view out over the rolling hills, mountains and valleys and rural skyline. Much of the exterior is floor-to-ceiling glass so the vastness and beauty of its surrounding can be completely absorbed.

The stunning property was designed so as to shelter its occupants from the harsh elements when necessary and provides some refuge from the strong winds in the area, but can also be opened up to them if weather permits.

The materials used - concrete, glass, and steel on the outside and plywood for the ceilings - were chosen to compliment the location, Vogue Living report.

The natural tones juxtaposed with the harsh metallic steel of the exterior make the house simultaneously stand-out and camouflage with its surroundings

The roof is designed to catch and store water and the natural tones juxtaposed with the harsh metalics of the steel exterior make the house simultaneously stand-out and camouflage with its surroundings.

It's intended owner will no longer occupy the property and instead the stunning house can be rented out by holidaymakers looking for a rural escape in the NSW Central Tablelands.

The Invisible House also took home the award for Best New House Over 200 Square Metres, at the presentation ceremony on Friday evening.

The home can also be opened up to let in the sunlight and a breeze if the weather is fine
