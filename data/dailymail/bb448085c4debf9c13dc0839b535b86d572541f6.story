Ten people have been killed after a Turkish navy tugboat capsized while docked for repairs at a shipyard on the Aegean coast.

Eight people killed in the incident were military personnel while the other two victims were civilians, the Turkish military confirmed today.

Tragedy: A tugboat capsized in a military shipyard in Izmir, Turkey, on Monday killing ten people

The tugboat, called TCG Degirmendere, was being lowered into the sea after maintenance work at the shipyard yesterday when it suddenly listed to one side, taking on water.

Six soldiers reportedly only managed to survive by jumping into the sea after control of the tugboat was lost at the shipyard in the Aegean province of İzmir.

Dramatic pictures today emerged showing the tugboat on its side in the dock.

The cause of the tug boat to capsize is still unknown. An investigation is under way.
