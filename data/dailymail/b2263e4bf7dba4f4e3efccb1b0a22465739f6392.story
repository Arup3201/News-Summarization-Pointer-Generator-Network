Promising sophisticated catwalk videos and stylish outfit advice, the new Marks & Spencer website was bound to attract attention when it launched this week amid great fanfare.

But there was one tiny snag with the whizzy brand-new site – the multi-million pound redesign left people struggling to actually buy anything.

Now customers are so angry that they are threatening to boycott the store altogether unless they bring back their old website.

One man complained on the store’s Facebook page, posting: ‘The whole website seems to have crashed. Please don’t treat me like a fool, this is extremely poor.’

Another said: ‘Oh dear, your new website is down! For goodness sake bring your old site back.’ And some shoppers suggested they would boycott M&S and take their purchases elsewhere, with one customer from Liverpool writing: ‘Oh Marks, what have you done! Sorry but I’m off to look at John Lewis and Debenhams.’

Shoppers yesterday were met with an error message when they tried to access the website, asking them to ‘please bear with us’. It added: ‘We are experiencing a higher than usual number of customers. You’re put in a queue. Please don’t close this window.’

Other people reported that items disappeared from their virtual baskets, while some ran into difficulties after being asked to reset their old passwords.

The problems started after the company decided to revamp the website, taking it away from a tried-and-tested platform developed by Amazon and moving the design and operation in-house. M&S went on to spend millions of pounds building the new website, setting up a software development team of 50 computer and design experts.

The new site – which is the result of a three-year development programme that involved two years of testing – is the brainchild of Laura Wade-Gery, executive director for multi-channel e-commerce at M&S.

She used to work for Tesco.com but was hired by M&S to oversee the high-profile expansion of their internet store in the UK as well as overseas.

Ahead of the launch of the website, Miss Wade-Gery said: ‘We’ve put customers at the heart of our rebuild so our new site really reflects how they want to browse and shop.’

Action: Customers have threatened to boycott the store if the old website is not restored

Some 21.2 per cent of clothes and 26.3 per cent of all the shoes bought in the UK are now purchased online.

M&S will have to offer next-day or same-day delivery to compete with web-savvy shops such as John Lewis, which has seen a huge surge in sales linked to its site.

A spokesman said: ‘We’re very proud of our new website, which has been positively received by customers and digital experts. We’ve had millions of successful visits, processed tens of thousands of orders and received hundreds of positive comments from users.

‘We did have a minor technical issue on Friday morning. However, we resolved it speedily.’
