Marissa Mayer, the CEO of Yahoo! known for being one of Silicon Valley’s most stylish ladies, posed for the blockbuster September issue of Vogue magazine.

It was the first extensive interview Mayer has given since her much ballyhooed—and highly paid—position at the tech giant in July 2012.

And while the ‘unusually stylish geek,’ as the magazine describes her, says she struggles with her own shyness, Mayer wasn’t holding back when she posed for a stunning two-page photo for the article.

Playing coy? Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer sat for a lengthy interview in Vogue in which she insists she's just a shy girl who loves to work

The former Google executive and spokesperson told Vogue the new job, for which she was paid a reported $6 million in her first year alone, is worth it for more than just the massive pay day.

‘I’m having the time of my life,’ she said.

And investors are right there with her. Stock in the company, seen as a sort of has been in the tech world, has soared since she became its leader.

Mayer has been a hot topic since she began at Yahoo!, and because of her work as CEO—notably, her acquisition of firms like Tumblr—she’s remained at the heart of the media’s tech talk.

But Mayer doesn’t consider herself the celebrity or the partying type.

‘I’m just geeky and shy and I like to code,’ said the fashionable millionaire. 

The
 article’s author Jacob Weisberg, who calls Mayer a 'geek’s geek,' 
concurred. ‘She was animated and excited about technical issues,’ he 
told USA Today. 

Mayer's playful side shines through in the article in addition to her wonkiness.

She
 and her husband purchased at auction a 15-foot model of a colorful 
local diner as a playhouse for their not quite 1-year-old son 
Macallister.

It will be a while before he's old enough to play with structure, which they had lowered into their yard with a forklift. But that's okay for Mayer.

'Mayer seems to have bought it just as much for herself,' wrote Weisberg.

Mayer also has 'happy art,' as she calls it--from the likes of such stars of the creative world as Jeff Koons and Roy Lichtenstein--throughout her home.

And the walls of her dining room are lined with purple and gold signs that originally adorned tables at her wedding. They name some of her favorite things and range from the flavor 'peppermint,' to the paisley-loving Italian design house 'Etro.'

But quirky isn’t the entire story, if judging just by her photo shoot.

Thrifty: She's worth an estimated $300 million but according to Vogue she drives to and from work in an 18-year-old BMW

The self-proclaimed shy girl, known for her dazzling entrances and unannounced exits at Silicon Valley’s ritziest gatherings comes off as more than comfortable in the 3,000 word interview.

And the same could be said for the accompanying photo for which she’s donned a form-fitting Michael Kors dress and daring Ives Saint Laurent heels.

‘I think she’s not as shy as she thinks she is,’ revealed Mayer’s investor husband Zachary Bogue.

Still, some signs do suggest that one of America’s most talked about CEOs shuns glamor as much as she says.

Though worth an estimated $300 million, Mayer shuttles herself to work in an eighteen year old BMW.

And work, more than galas or photo shoots, appears to be where she is most comfortable.

‘One
 night I looked up and was like, “Oh, my God, it's midnight and I have a
 husband and I'm, like, eight months pregnant. I need to leave!,”’ joked
 the new mom. ‘I was just here working, having the best possible time.’

The article, titled Hail to the Chief, is in the September issue of Vogue and hits national news stands August 20.
