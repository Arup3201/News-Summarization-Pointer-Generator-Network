A drunken university student stabbed three people to death and injured more than two dozen others on a packed train in Taiwan.

The seemingly random attack occurred at about 4 p.m. yesterday at the start of rush hour aboard a train on Taipei's Banqiao line.

Taipei Police Chief Chen Kou-en identified the attacker as a
 21-year-old second-year student at Tunghai University in the central 
city of Taichung.

A drunken university student wielding a knife attacked riders aboard a subway train in Taiwan's capital on Wednesday, killing three people and injuring nearly two dozen others

The seemingly random attack occurred at about 4 p.m. at the start of rush hour aboard a train on Taipei's Banqiao line, which leads to the city's southwestern suburbs

Photos showed the floor of one of the train's cars and the adjacent station platform splattered with blood and strewn with backpacks, umbrellas and other items

Those killed were a 47-year-old woman and two men, one in his 20s and the other in his 30s, police said.

Chen
 said the man told police he had wanted to do something 'shocking and 
big' and had plotted to carry out the attack from childhood. Chen said 
no other motive was presently known.

Police
 said the man used a 10 centimetre-long (3 inch-long) knife in the 
attack, and that he was also carrying a second blade three times as 
long.

The government's Central News Agency and other media outlets described panicked passengers rushing from the train when it arrived at the Jiangzicui station, shouting for those waiting on the platform to flee

They said security guards quickly called for police, who apprehended the man and took him into custody.

They said the man smelt strongly of alcohol.

Street crime is extremely rare in Taipei, one of Asia's safest cities, and violent incidents are practically unheard of in the city's extensive and well managed subway system.
