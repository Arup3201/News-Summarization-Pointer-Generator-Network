An innocent husband who reported his wife missing was only told she was dead when he was arrested for her murder.

The body of mother-of-five Angela Edwards was found just 200 yards from the home she shared with her husband of six years, Stephen Edwards, in St Helens in Lancashire.

The 38-year-old only found out his wife was dead after police told him he was being held on suspicion of murder.

He remained on police bail for his wife's funeral, but police have now ditched the murder inquiry and dropped all action current and future against him. They said they believe her death is not likely to have been suspicious.

Mr Edwards said: 'In the space of two days I lost my wife, my life fell apart and I found myself locked in a cell.

Stephen Edwards only discovered his wife, a mother of five, was dead when police wrongly arrested him for her murder. The couple had been married for six years and police have now ditched the murder inquiry 

'It was awful - it's the kind of thing you never think is going to happen to you.

'I'm obviously relieved to now have that suspicion off my shoulders - but I knew all along that nothing was going to happen because I hadn't done anything wrong.'

Mr Edwards was a carer for his wife who was unable to work because she had bipolar disorder and had slipped a disc. 

The couple have seven children between them from previous relationships. Mrs Edwards had four daughters, a son and two grandchildren.

She was reported missing on September 19 by her husband, and her body was then discovered in undergrowth in fields at about 3pm the following day.

Floral tributes have been placed close to where she was found, remembering a 'happy woman' who was loved by local children in St Helens.

Mr Edwards, 38, worked as  a full time carer for his wife, who had bipolar disorder and  a slipped disc

Mr Edwards was initially arrested on suspicion of wounding after a spot of blood was found in their kitchen and was then told he was being held on suspicion of murder.  

A spokesman for Merseyside Police said that Mr Edwards had been released and no further action would be taken against him. 

He even had to attend his wife's funeral when he was still on bail and describes the ordeal as the 'worst two weeks' of his life.  

Police said there had been no further arrests and there was 'nothing pointing towards anything suspicious,' but they would have to wait until the outcome of the inquest. 

Mr Edwards told the St Helens Star: 'Every time I look out of the window, I can see the spot where she was found.

'It's devastating. I love her to bits and I'll never, ever stop missing her. She was a lovely person, very kind and giving.'

He said he plans to lodge a complaint with Merseyside Police about the way he has been treated.
