A Washington state man is accused of swapping furniture with his neighbors while they were away.

The News Tribune reports the Lakewood man and a friend who is accused of helping him pleaded not guilty Wednesday to charges of residential burglary.

Court papers say a couple who returned to their apartment at the 5700 block of 95th Street Southwest on Monday found their love seat, matching chair and other belongings gone.

A recliner and TV stand were left in their place.

Information on a traffic ticket and pizza receipt left by the alleged thief pointed to the neighbor.

The suspect told police he thought the couple had moved and abandoned their furniture.

Police say he told them he was drunk when he decided to switch furniture, calling his buddy for help.

The alleged thief showed police where the property was and led them to find the living room set which consisted of four pillows, two floor lamps, two end tables, a TV stand and an inflatable couch with an air pump.

In addition to the set were three blankets, an iron, a picture with an ornamental frame, a floor fan, the military equipment, a black stand with four shelves and a plastic container with three drawers and various items inside.

Police also found a chair, a wall mirror, an ironing board and a box of ladies footwear.

Police believe that the thief broke into the apartment via a crawl space and this isn’t the first time someone broke into the property that way.

Police say that the suspect’s brother broke into the house when the tenants prior to these ones lived there.
