Gary Neville says he is a worried that Liverpool's recent form will see them knock Manchester United out of the Barclays Premier League top four and leave them without Champions League football for a second successive year.

Liverpool face Burnley at Anfield on Wednesday night having taken 19 points from a possible 21 in the last two months while United have stumbled, claiming just 13 in the same period.

Louis van Gaal's side travel on Newcastle United on Wednesday ahead of a daunting run of fixtures that includes Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur, Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea within their next seven games.

Gary Neville fears Liverpool could leapfrog Manchester United and take the final Champions League spot

And United legend Neville is concerned that his former club will be unable to hold off the Merseyside club in the fight for a top-four place as the season reaches its biting point.

'For the first time this season I am concerned as to whether Manchester United can fight them off in the scrap for the Champions League places,' Neville wrote in his Daily Telegraph column. 

'It’s fair to say Liverpool have emerged as much more of a threat than I considered a few weeks ago.

'I arrived at Anfield expecting City to reassert themselves in the title race and make their extra few days preparation. It both impressed and concerned me to see Liverpool play as they did.'

Chelsea and United's local rivals City are widely expected to take up two of the Premier League's four qualification places and with Arsenal going strong in third place, United, Liverpool, Southampton and Tottenham will all be eyeing the last spot.

'Liverpool look as well equipped as any side to take that final Champions League spot now,' Neville added. 'They've stopped conceding goals, have found a system that works for their players and have their high intensity game back.'

Although now a pundit, Neville remains supportive of United from his playing days spent at Old Trafford
