Disgraced: Retired New York City Police Detective Louis Scarcella's (pictured last year) brother Michael Scarcella was found dead Thursday of an apparent suicide

The cop brother of a retired NYPD detective under investigation for a series of questionable murder investigations over the past few decades was found dead Thursday.

Michael Scarcella, 50, of Brooklyn, reportedly committed suicide. He is the brother of 62-year-old Louis Scarcella, a shamed former homicide detective in the department.

It is not clear exactly how Michael Scarcella took his own life, according to the New York Daily News. His body was found shortly after 11.00 a.m.

Michael Scarcella was not known to be under any kind of misconduct investigation, but his older brother has been heavily scrutinized for the past 12 months.

Five men in prison for about 20 years each were released from custody after it was found they were wrongfully convicted of killings investigated by the elder Scarcella.

More than 50 additional cases dating back to the 1980s are under review by the Brooklyn district attorney, according to recent reports.

Additional convictions are expected to be overturned after it was revealed Louis Scarcella threatened several suspects and witnesses, and even called on the same drug addict multiple times to provide testimony that helped land convictions.

Louis Scarcella was once seen as a rising star in the department because he was able to get an unprecedented number of convictions.

A MailOnline call to Louis Scarcella’s home went unanswered, and a family member told the Daily news that he was ‘with family.’

His younger brother died a 25-year NYPD veteran.
