Eight people have been shot dead and others injured after a 'mentally unstable' gunman stormed a Czech restaurant before taking his own life. 

The gunman, who is said to have been around 60 years old, went into the restaurant and started shooting indiscriminately before reportedly turning the gun on himself.

A police spokesman confirmed the shooting in the town of Uhersky Brod, which is 180 miles south east of Prague, but declined to comment on any of the victims.

Tonight, grieving locals were leaving candles in tribute to the victims of the attack as they struggled to deal with the shock of the shootings.

Shock: Grieving locals left candles at the scene of the shooting. Mayor Patrik Kuncar said: 'Nobody believed anything like that could happen in such a small town'

Also tonight, police had cordoned off a house in the town, believed to be the home of the gunman.

One man - named in reports as Petr Gabriel - told how he was in the restaurant's bathroom when the shooting began.

He said that saved his life and he told Czech public television that he then stayed hidden for two hours until he was found by police.

Patrik Kuncar, the mayor of the small town, said that the shooter was a local man  and that he was carrying two weapons, including a shotgun.

He added: 'I have been conveyed information that it was a 60-year-old local man, probably mentally unstable.

'I assume this was an isolated incident. I cannot see security measures that would prevent incidents like this.

'We have various anti-terrorist measures but we can see that, here, probably a lone shooter struck with no warning.

'Nobody believed anything like that could happen in such a small town. I can hardly imagine what consequences it will have for the future life in this town.' 

A waitress in the restaurant was shot in the chest and had hour-long surgery, said Dana Lipovska, spokesman for the hospital in the nearby town of Uherske Hradiste. 

Her condition tonight remained 'very serious,' Lipovska said.

The owner of the restaurant, Pavel Karlik, said the attacker had walked in and started firing a handgun indiscriminately.

Urgent: A rescue helicopter stands at the side of the road close to the restaurant ready to take any shooting victims to hospital 

He added: 'I immediately ran out through the back door, along with other guests who then called an ambulance and police.'

The country's Interior Minister Milan Chovanec, tonight visited the scene and said: 'It was not a terrorist attack'.

The gunman was armed with two pistols and opened fire at the approaching police officers, Chovanec said.

The attack shocked the town of 17,000, which is home to the Ceska Zbrojovka gun plant.

The victims have been identified and were all from the region, Chovanec said.

Drama: A police officer put cordon tape in place next to the restaurant where eight people were killed around noon when enjoying lunch 

Officials: Mayor of Uherksy Brod, Patrik Kuncar, was quickly on the scene and said that the shooter was a local man and that he was carrying two weapons, including a shotgun

According to Czech television, the gunman stormed into the Druzhba restaurant and started shooting randomly, firing off 25 rounds around noon.

One witness added that around 20 people were in the restaurant at the time of the shooting enjoying lunch.

Other reports say the gunman called a Czech TV station shortly before the attack and spoke of his plans to open fire.

It is thought that he told a journalist that he had been 'hurt' by people and the police had not helped him.

Guard: Police officers stand guard near to where a gunman opened fire. They closed roads in the area surrounding the scene 

Panic: Police cordoned off roads as witnesses say that around 20 people were in the restaurant at the time of the shooting

The shooter reportedly said: 'They're bullying me. I'm going to take care of this myself' as well as saying he was going to 'take things into his hands.'

Emergency services were quickly on the scene and the restaurant was then cordoned off by officers wearing bullet proof vests.  

The Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, who is currently visiting South Korea, released a statement saying he had been made aware of the shooting and expressed his condolences to those affected.

Meanwhile Thorbjorn Jagland, the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, tweeted: 'Horrified at reports of #UherskyBrod shooting. An act of unspeakable violence. Our thoughts are with the victims, families and Czech people.' 

The Czech Republic has strict gun control laws but hunting is popular in the eastern European nation. 

The country became an independent nation in 1993 after the split of Czechoslovakia.
