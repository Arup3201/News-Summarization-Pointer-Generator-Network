David Blunkett today revealed he made 
two private trips to the U.S. to plead with authorities to let Gary 
McKinnon stay in the UK while he faces court proceedings.

The former Labour home secretary has visited Washington twice to argue that British alleged computer hacker Mr McKinnon should remained in Britain while facing court proceedings in America.

Asperger's sufferer Mr McKinnon, 45, has been the subject of an intense extradition batte but would be jailed in the UK if Mr Blunkett's plan is successful.

Plea: Gary McKinnon and his mother Janice Sharp are campaigning against his extradition

Mr McKinnon said he was searching for evidence of 'little green men' when he hacked into Nasa and Pentagon computers from his bedroom in north London.

MPs were today debating whether the Government's treaty allowing fast-tracking of suspects to America needs reform to 'strengthen the protection of British citizens'.

Mr Blunkett told the BBC there was 'no substantial difference' between how each country's citizens are treated and said there was 'no way the US is going to renegotiate the treaty'.

But he told the BBC it was more important to find out 'whether it is possible, using modern technology and video conferencing for the trial to take place on US soil, but for Gary to remain in Britain and for him to serve his sentence here'.

Conservative backbencher Dominic Raab, who pushed for today's debate said: 'No one wants to scrap extradition. What we want is a bit of common sense and some safeguards for our citizens.'

The mother of Gary McKinnon today begs MPs to stand up for Britain by voting to change the unfair extradition laws.

Plea: Former Labour home secretary David Blunkett has made two trips to Washington to argue the case of alleged hacker Gary McKinnon

In an impassioned open letter in the Mail, Janis Sharp tells politicians taking part in tonight's crunch debate that the lopsided rules are causing 'terror without end'.

Urging them to vote in favour of changing the UK/U.S. extradition treaty, she adds: 'We're counting on you – don't let us down.'

There is huge back-bench support from all parties ahead of the landmark vote calling for reforms to the treaty – which gives U.S. citizens far greater protection than their British counterparts. 

Supporters of Mr McKinnon, who has Asperger's syndrome, include London Mayor Boris Johnson, celebrities and civil liberties groups. But campaigners need a huge turnout in the debate if they are to claim success.

Rumours continue to swirl that Downing Street – under huge pressure from the U.S. Embassy – might attempt a secret operation to prevent the motion being passed.

Officially, Number Ten says it is relaxed about the outcome and that MPs can vote with their conscience. But ministers and their aides – including supporters of Mr McKinnon – have been quietly tapped on the shoulder and instructed to vote against the motion.

It is hoped that a large turnout of Tory, Lib Dem and Labour MPs in the Commons will scare them off trying to sabotage the vote.

The case of 45-year-old Mr McKinnon, who was arrested a decade ago on allegations of hacking into Nasa and Pentagon computers while searching for evidence of 'little green men' from his north London home, has highlighted the unfairness of the 2003 treaty.

Adamant: American Ambassador Louis Susman is putting huge pressure on Downing Street to extradite Mr McKinnon

Tory MP Dominic Raab, who will lead today's debate, has uncovered figures showing that, between 2004 and July 2011, 123 people of all nationalities were extradited from  Britain to the U.S. During the same period, only 54 travelled in the opposite direction.

Last week, the U.S. Ambassador Louis Susman made two extraordinary visits to the Commons to defend the Act – leading to claims he was 'strong-arming' elected MPs.

Mr Susman, in a letter to the Mail, made clear that his country will not voluntarily agree to any changes to the treaty, which he continues to insist is fair. Under the Act, if the U.S. government want to extradite a UK citizen it needs only to outline the alleged offence, the punishment specified by statute and provide an accurate description of the suspect.

The test is known as 'reasonable suspicion'. But to extradite an American from the States, Britain must prove 'probable cause' – which the U.S. constitution defines as 'information sufficient to warrant a prudent person's belief that the wanted individual has committed a crime'.

The ambassador claims: 'There may be some confusion because the standards of  evidence for extradition under the treaty are different in terminology.  But in practice, “probable cause” and “reasonable suspicion” are the same. Both are the tests that police officers in our respective countries must meet to justify an arrest.'

Mr Susman continues: 'The United States never wants to be unfair to UK citizens. We merely want the interests of justice served.'

Tonight's vote, which already has the backing of 50 backbenchers, calls for changes to the controversial European Arrest Warrant, as well as UK/U.S. laws. It gives Tory MPs a  chance to demand the return of powers from Brussels.

The motion was jointly proposed by Mr Raab, ex-Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell and Keith Vaz, Labour chairman of the home affairs select committee.

Tory David Davis said: 'It is plain that the last government in the rush to appease both the U.S. and Europeans over extradition created an engine for injustice which many innocent people are  suffering from today.'

Gary McKinnon's mother Janis Sharp has begged MPs to stop her son being extradited

Our MPs must support this motion as no one else should ever be subjected to a decade of mental torture as my son Gary has.

This is not a party political issue. Every British politician's first duty is to British people rather than to any foreign nation. Yet pressure is being applied by the U.S. Ambassador and the U.S. Attorney General for MPs to vote against.

Such coercion is a wholly inappropriate interference in Britain's affairs and the U.S. would not take kindly to such meddling by the UK, were the roles reversed.

Extradition was meant to bring someone back to a country they had fled from after committing a heinous crime but British pensioners, students and computer geeks with autism are being targeted by America even when never having set foot there.

The U.S. are abusing the treaty simply because they can, since our safeguards were shockingly dispensed with.

Gary embarrassed the U.S. by highlighting their cyber security as pitiful, as they had no passwords or firewalls on their computers. He could have paid for his foolishness years ago had he been prosecuted in the UK as others have.

When Gary rang me in 2002 to say he had been arrested, my heart sank when discovering he'd been interviewed by the police with no lawyer. A suggested six-month community service sentence by UK police quickly turned into a maximum 60-year sentence once America took over. We might speak a similar language but our sense of justice is poles apart.

Seeing the deterioration in Gary's mental health breaks my heart. His intelligent and curious mind and spirit has been broken and for what?

American and British authorities left Gary on the internet for three and a half years after his arrest, proving they knew he was no threat. Gary is gentle to the core but has lost ten years of his youth and now sits in darkness with no respite from what is psychological torture.

Every day for ten excruciating years we have lived in a constant state of terror seemingly without end.

I occasionally foster siblings when police emergencies crop up. I'm sitting here with a ten-week-old baby brought to my door when their mother was rushed to hospital.

Looking down at him reminds me of when Gary was a baby. He was safe in my arms and no one could hurt him and I knew I would protect him with my life. With his mop of auburn hair, green eyes and elfin face he was different.

As a toddler he used to ask me about the stars and the planets and when the world was going to end. Gary has Asperger's Syndrome and wants to save our planet but unfortunately his obsession with the stars has resulted in his life being destroyed.

There are times when floods of tears well up and I'm overwhelmed by emotion. I remember arriving in London with Gary when he was six years old and I wish I was somehow able to go back in time and to change everything and that Gary had invented a time machine.

Since his arrest our lives have changed completely. We were forced to sell our home and every waking moment is spent campaigning for Gary. I'm driven to fight constantly for my son's life and sleep has become a luxury as my mind is on overdrive thinking of what else I can do to stop him from being dragged thousands of miles from his family, to a foreign land.

In despicable online child pornography cases, America prosecutes in the location of the keyboard. Why then is that principle not appropriate for someone like Gary who was searching for information on UFOs and Free Energy? So try Gary, and others like him, in the UK. David Cameron twice went to President Obama to ask for Gary to be to be tried in the UK.

Gordon Brown went to Hillary Clinton and the U.S. Ambassador to plead for Gary. However America chose to snub these requests which our leaders would never have done had the boot been on the other foot.

So David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg, please unite on this matter of principle and don't be swayed by America's tantrums but instead allow a truly free vote today for all MPs. Our government also must honour their pre-election promises as British rights and British lives are at stake.

A vote against Dominic Raab, Sir Menzies Campbell and Keith Vaz's cross-party motion to strengthen and restore our safeguards would be a gross betrayal of all British citizens.

We're counting on you – don't let us down.
