This is the dramatic moment that a helicopter carrying 16 oil workers had to be manually lowered by crew after it ran into difficulties while coming in for landing.  

Aberdeen International Airport was
 placed on full emergency alert while the CHC-operated S92 aircraft was suspended in the air and airbags were set up on the ground for safe landing.

The helicopter could be seen hovering just 8ft above crew as they worked to pull down the aircraft's landing gear, which had failed to deploy.

This is the dramatic moment a ground crew had to manually lower the 
landing gear of a helicopter - which was carrying 16 oil workers home from a North Sea platform - after it ran into problems at 
Aberdeen airport

The warning light came on in the cockpit of the aircraft as it arrived back to the airport from a North Sea platform where the oil workers had been based.

The incident took place on Tuesday, but photographs emerged days later showing the crew in action.

One of the images was posted on an online forum for oil and gas workers and the photograph received a mixed response online.

One local wireline operator, Mike Wetherly, of Aberdeen, said: 'Fair play to the lads that got under and sorted the landing gear! Good effort boys.'

And oil worker Gavin Kimpton, of Sheffield, said: 'I was due out just after it landed and spoke with the guys coming off that chopper. It was hovering for an hour before they did this.'

But others were less enthusiastic about 
the dramatic end to the flight. Social media user Craig Stappard, from 
Newcastle, said: 'This just gets worse.'

The runway remained open for other aircraft and an Aberdeen International Airport spokeswoman said flights were not affected by the incident.

CHC said the aircraft would undergo 'rigorous checks' and maintenance procedures before going back into service.

A
 CHC spokeswoman said: 'An aircraft landed safely after an undercarriage
 indicator came on during the approach to Aberdeen Airport.

'The
 initial engineering inspection revealed that deployment of the landing 
gear was delayed. It was successfully lowered manually and the aircraft 
landed normally.

'The aircraft will be subject to rigorous engineering checks before returning to service.'

The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said they were called out to a full emergency at the airport at 10:26am.

An SFRS spokesman said: 'We stood by and set up airbags to try to allow the helicopter to land.

'We had them set up in preparation. But it ended up landing safely.'

The dramatic landing rescue comes after a string of fatal accidents which have heightened awareness of helicopter safety in the offshore oil industry.

Last August, four oil workers were killed when their Super Puma L2 helicopter crashed off Shetland, a mile from the airport. 

It led to a review being launched specifically looking at helicopter airworthiness, training, 
seat layout and 'operator decision making'.

In 2009, 14 oil workers and two pilots were also killed when a Super Puma operated by Bond suffered a catastrophic gearbox failure.

The rotor blades broke away from the aircraft as it was returning to Aberdeen from BP’s Miller platform.
