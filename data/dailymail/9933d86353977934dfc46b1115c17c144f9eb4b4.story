Lucy to be alive: Dougie Thomson reveals his injuries suffered in the crocodile attack

With its well-manicured greens and fabulous beach side location, the 18-hole course at Cancun has a deserved reputation as a golfer’s paradise.

For Dougie Thomson, however, it turned out to be a living hell.

The 58-year-old British tourist is lucky to be alive after he was attacked by a 12ft crocodile at the Mexican resort.

He was only saved when his friends beat the animal with their clubs and drove a golf buggy over it repeatedly to get it to release its grip from his right thigh.

Father-of-two Mr Thomson needed an emergency operation after the attack which happened as he played a bunker shot near a tropical swamp.

The engineer is now recovering in hospital after having his leg put back together with 200 stitches.

Relatives are preparing to fly him back home so he can continue his recovery.

Mr Thomson was attacked as he played at the Iberostar Cancun Golf Course.

Recalling the drama from his  hospital bed, he said: ‘My ball was in the bunker around ten to 15 feet from thick shrubbery.

'I didn’t even know there was water behind the bushes. I took a shot and it landed on the green.

‘Then I heard this noise behind me and this huge crocodile snapped me by the thigh. I couldn’t feel pain. I was in total shock.

‘It was like a big toy, big black eyes looking at me. Hitting it was like hitting a brick wall.’

Mr Thomson said his leg 'looked like a butcher's shop window' after being savaged by the crocodile

One of Mr Thomson’s two friends had to drive his golf buggy over the crocodile while the other two hit it with their clubs.

Savaged: A crocodile like the one that carried out the attack

The
 animal attacked the golf cart before slinking back into the swamp from 
where it had first appeared.

Mr Thomson, who had travelled to Mexico for
 a wedding, said: ‘The crocodile tore away all the muscle in my thigh. 
My leg is like a butcher’s shop window. Initially only two of us were 
going golfing.

‘If that had
 happened, there is no way one friend could have helped. It would have 
pulled me back into the lagoon and had me for supper.’

He added: ‘Even after it  happened, other people were still playing golf.

‘You’d
 have thought there would have been at least a policeman to take a 
report. When my friend went back, the crocodile was still there, just 
waiting.’

Doctors are now monitoring Mr Thomson for  infections and 
checking him for tendon damage.

Brother Bob Thomson said the attack had left the whole family ‘traumatised and shocked’.

He
 said: ‘We are worried and wondering what kind of golf course would 
allow these animals to roam around.

'We hope Douglas will be able to 
continue working and playing golf but we don’t know.’

Mr
 Thomson, from Wishaw near Glasgow, is the second golfer to be bitten by
 a crocodile at the same golf course in recent months.

American Edward 
Lunger, 50, was taking a practice swing when a crocodile leapt from 
behind some bushes and bit off two of his fingers. He was only saved 
when a friend jumped from a golf cart and smashed the reptile over the 
head with a boulder.

'What kind of golf course would allow these 
animals to roam around?' The golf course at the Iberostar Cancun, where 
Mr Thomson was playing a round when he was suddenly set upon by the 
man-eating reptile

The Iberostar Cancun hotel boasts on its website it is the only resort in the area with an 18-hole championship golf course.

Reviews
 claim the tropical birds, native iguanas and huge crocodiles which live
 in the grounds and fairways make playing there ‘an unforgettably 
natural experience’.

A spokesman for the hotel said it wouldn’t be making any comment.
