Police are hunting for two thieves in Florida who stole an iPad from a canoe rental office before making their getaway in a kayak.

The pair were caught on security cameras picking the tablet computer, worth $700, up from the front desk of Wekiva canoe rental before one of them places it in his bag.

But instead of making a conventional escape on foot, the pair decided to jump in a kayak and paddle to freedom instead.

But now they are being hunted by Seminole County deputies, who think they could have been rowing toward Wekiva Springs State Park.

According to deputies one suspect is a
 Hispanic man with a partial goatee, dark colored hair, a blue and light
 blue horizontally striped tank top, and black plaid shorts.

He took the iPad from the front desk before going to the bathrooms and meeting with another man, described as being a white male wearing a dark colored hat, and a white shirt with a design on the front.

After meeting it appeared that the Hispanic male put the iPad in the white male's backpack.

Officers are still hunting for the missing pair, and anyone with information is being asked to call the Seminole County Police Department at 407-665-1720.
