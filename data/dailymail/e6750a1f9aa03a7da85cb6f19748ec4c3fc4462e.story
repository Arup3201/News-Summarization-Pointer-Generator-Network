Some lucky Brits could be in for a white Christmas this year, according to new predictions from the Met Office.

Forecasters said people in Wales, Scotland and high areas elsewhere in the country could be greeted by snowflakes on Christmas morning.

The Met Office's technical definition of a white Christmas only requires one snowflake to fall anywhere in the country, making it very likely that this year will fit the bill.

According to the Met Office, heavy rain will pass late on Christmas Eve to make way for snowfall across the UK

Parts of the UK, including the Yorkshire Dales, already have a light coating of snow that will thicken

Only 14 years of the past 52 have failed to produce snow somewhere in the UK. And in 2014, northern areas higher than 200m above sea level, and southern areas above 400m are likely to be in line for a light dusting.

And bright and mild weather is likely to greet the rest of us on Christmas Day, after blustery lead-up.

Analysts said that there will be 'pleasant' conditions with highs of 6 degrees centigrade in the north and 8 degrees in the north of the country.

Helen Roberts, a forecaster with the Met Office, said: 'Snow could fall above a couple of hundred metres in the north and 400m in the south.

'There won’t be widespread snow but it will be largely over hills and higher ground.'

'The official definition of a white Christmas is just one snowflake falling in that 24-hour period. Most people think of a white Christmas as seeing a little bit more than that, though.

Travellers are warned to take care when driving over the Christmas period as temperatures plummet

A white Christmas is technically when one snowflake falls, which has happened 38 Christmases in the last 52 years. Widespread snow has only occurred four times in the same time period

'For a lot of the UK it’ll be a fairly decent day, with some sunshine,  lighter winds than the previous few days – feeling a little bit more pleasant, though it will be quite chilly – between 4 and 6 degrees in the north and 5 and 8 degrees in the south.'

'There will be showers, but largely towards western parts of the UK, in Scotland, Wales and south-west England.

'Places like the Welsh hills and mountains could see a bit of snow, as could the Pennines and the mountains in Scotland.'

According to the Sunday Express, bookmakers Ladbrokes have now cut their odds for snow falling in London on Christmas Day from 12/1 to 8/1.

Odds for Edinburgh and Glasgow are 3/1, with Manchester at 4/1, Leeds at 6/1 and Cardiff and Birmingham at 8/1.

A spokesman said: “Punters had given up all hope of a White Christmas but the latest news has seen a flurry of bets for a festive snowfall on December 25th.'

While most dream of gardens blanketed with crisp, white snow, the Met Office says the definition is of a single snowflake falling in the 24 hours of December 25.

But we are often left disappointed as climate history shows wintry weather is more likely between January and March.

Snow or sleet falls on average five days in December, compared to 7.6 days in January, 6.8 days in February and six days in March.

But we can remain optimistic as at least one snowflake has fallen on 38 Christmases in the last 52 years.

Snow lying on the ground on Christmas Day is much rarer.

White Christmases were more frequent in the 18th and 19th centuries, according to the Met Office.

The change of calendar in 1752, which effectively brought Christmas Day back by 12 days, also minimised the chances.

Climate change has also brought higher average temperatures over land and sea, which generally reduces the probability of a white Christmas.

But experts claim that will not make them less likely in the future.
