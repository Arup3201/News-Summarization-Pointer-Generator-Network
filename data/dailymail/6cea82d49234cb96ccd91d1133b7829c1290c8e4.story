It’s quite common for celebrities to cause a stir as they board flights in Los Angeles, but a very different kind of passenger excited paps at the airport today.

Athena became the first humanoid robot to have paid for a seat on a passenger plane when it boarded a Lufthansa flight to Germany.

The robot even had to check-in and collect its tickets before being strapped into the flight.

The robot, dubbed Athena, (pedicured) was created by German roboticists Alexander Herzog )right) and Jeannette Bohg (left). It is being flown to Max Planck Institute for Computational Learning and Motor Control Laboratory in Baden-Württemberg

Athena was created by PhD student Alexander Herzog and his colleague Jeannette Bohg.

The pair is taking Athena to the Max Planck Institute for Computational Learning and Motor Control Laboratory in Germany to program it how to walk.

Athena was pushed through the Tom Bradley International Terminal in a wheelchair, dressed in a T-shirt and red shoes.

It had a passport and ticket, and had to go through the usual security procedures as its fellow human passengers before boarding flight number 9801 from LAX to Frankfurt.

LAX Airport’s official Twitter feed documented the event. It wrote: ‘First-ever flight by humanoid robot Athena as a paid passenger on a commercial passenger airline @Lufthansa_USA'

Athena was then strapped into a seat alongside Mr Herzog and Ms Bohg.

LAX Airport’s official Twitter feed documented the event.

It wrote: ‘First-ever flight by humanoid robot Athena as a paid passenger on a commercial passenger airline @Lufthansa_USA will occur today at noon.

‘Athena will be accompanied by scientists. A humanoid robot has a head, arms, & legs. Photos to come when she arrives at LAX to check-in!’

Earlier this month, Nescafe began using a humanoid called Pepper to help sell its coffee machines in Japan.

The sleek, all-white robot, has a tablet mounted to its chest, and can chat with customers about their coffee habits and preferences.

Equipped with the latest voice and emotion recognition technology, Pepper is able to read people's facial expressions and listen to their tone of voice to analyse how they're feeling.

'Pepper will be able to explain Nescafé products and services and engage in conversation with consumers. 

'I hope that this new consumer engagement model will expand across the world as an example of Japanese innovation' said Kohzoh Takaoka, president and boss of Nestlé Japan.
