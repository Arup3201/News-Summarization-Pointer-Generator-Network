Liverpool and their impressive unbeaten penalty record came to an abrupt end on Thursday when they were dumped out of the Europa League by Turkish outfit Besiktas.

Dejan Lovren missed the vital spot kick which not only ended their European dream - but put a stop to their 100 per cent record in continental competition.

Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana, Emre Can and Joe Allen all scored from 12 yards out but it wasn't enough to see Brendan Rodgers's side through.

Chelsea - Champions League Semi - 4-1 win

Besiktas - Europa League last 32 - 5-4 loss 

Roma were their first victims back in 1984 when Liverpool won the European Cup (now the Champions League) and after a tight 1-1 draw at the Stadio Olimpico, Joe Fagan's side held their nerve from 12 yards to lift the trophy. 

AC Milan were next to be denied by the impressive penalty juggernaut that was Liverpool - who at this point had only lost one shootout in their entire history - as the English produced one of the most memorable and dramatic comebacks of all-time to lift the coveted trophy.

Jose Mourinho, during his first spell at Chelsea, was knocked out of the Champions League semi-finals a couple of seasons later, when his side missed two spot kicks (Arjen Robben and Geremi) and Dirk Kuyt slotted home the winner for the Reds.

Despite their European run coming to an end, Liverpool can boast an impressive 80 per cent penalty shootout win record in all competitions.

Having faced 15 in their past, the Reds have won a respectable 12, with their first loss coming against Wimbledon in 1993.

One of the biggest shocks in their history came via a penalty shootout when League Two side Northampton Town sent them crashing out of the League Cup in 2010.
