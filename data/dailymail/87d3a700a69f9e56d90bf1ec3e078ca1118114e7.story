Prime minister Tony Abbott will travel to the Netherlands on Sunday where he will meet with Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, before being briefed on the ongoing identification of the victims of Malaysia Airlines flight 17.

The Dutch government has issued a brief statement announcing Mr Abbott's will visit The Hague on Monday and sign a condolence book.

'Over the past few weeks, the Netherlands and Australia have been working together closely to repatriate and identify all the victims as soon as possible,' the statement said.

'Following the meeting (with Mr Rutte), Prime Minister Abbott will sign the book of condolence for the Dutch victims of the disaster.'

Earlier on Friday, it was revealed forensic experts working in Hilversum in the Netherlands had identified a further 21 victims of flight MH17.

Only two bodies had previously been identified, both Dutch nationals.

The 21 additional victims comprise 16 Dutch, including a dual British national, two Malaysians, a German, a Canadian and a Briton.

The search for body parts at the crash site in eastern Ukraine has been suspended due to escalating clashes between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russia separatists.

'To date it has been a daily challenge to keep working without interruption. The experts wore protective vests for their own safety and regularly heard shooting in the vicinity of the search area,' a statement from the head of the recovery mission, Pieter-Jaap Aalbersberg, on Wednesday said.

It went on to say that the team called on local residents to hand in any personal belongings of the victims that they had collected and share any further information.

'There are a total of 10 one-cubic-meter packages filled with personal belongings. These include items of great significance to the victims' loved ones, such as photo albums, cameras, jewelry, diaries, passports and cuddly toys,' Mr Aalbersberg said.

In a statement released on the same day, Prime minister Rutte said: 'In 2 or 3 weeks we hope to be able to reveal how many bodies have been recovered in total.'

'Seven hundred DNA samples have been taken and are currently being analysed. Once that process is complete, we will know how many victims have been brought back to Hilversum.'

Two military transporters arrived in the southern Dutch city of Eindhoven on Friday carrying 142 police experts from the Netherlands, Australia and Malaysia.

On Thursday, Mr Abbott attended a national day of mourning service in Melbourne, where he told passengers' relatives: 'You have not been abandoned and you never will be.'
