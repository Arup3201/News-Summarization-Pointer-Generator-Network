If you've recently bought an Amazon Fire TV box, you may have noticed the amount of data you’re using has jumped.

This is due to a bug in the streaming box’s screensaver feature that means picture files aren’t being cached correctly.

Screensaver images are taken directly from a user’s cloud storage, and the bug causes the full picture size to be used - rather than a compressed version - each time the screensaver refreshes.

Amazon Fire TV users have complained that the streaming box is draining their internet data. Amazon said this is due to a bug in the streaming box's screensaver feature (pictured) that means
image files aren't being cached properly. It is working on fixing the problem and has advised users to disable the feature temporarily

Any photos and videos uploaded to Amazon Cloud Drive are automatically available on Amazon Fire TV.

These images can be used to create a screensaver for the streaming box.

The screensaver launches when Amazon Fire TV is left idle, and the default screensaver uses a slideshow of images.

The 'mosaic' screensaver, instead, shows these images as an ever-changing grid. 

The data use flaw was only discovered in this mosaic layout. 

To disable this feature, press the Home button, select Settings, select System, and then select Screen Saver.

And each time an image is taken, the box uses data to extract the file.

Amazon told MailOnline it is aware of the
 problem and is working on getting it fixed. It added that affected 
users can disable the feature in the meantime.

The issue was raised by California-based Tyler Hayes, who complained to Amazon about data use on his Fire TV after discovering the streaming box was using more than 60GB of data a day.

Once he unplugged the device, data barely peaked above 20GB.

Other users have similarly complained on forum threads including Hacker News. 

The amount of data the bug drains depends on how many photos are being used in the screensaver, so it can vary.

People with unlimited data packages may not be charged extra for the additional use, but they're speed may be capped - depending on the deal they have with their service provider.

Users who have a set data limit may find themselves exceeding their monthly caps and could be charged extra. 

Hayes initially blamed Amazon Fire TV’s Advanced Streaming and Prediction (ASAP) feature for draining his data.

ASAP learns what movies and shows users like, and gets them ready to be watched. This is designed to remove buffering, but means data is used in the background to prepare these shows.

This tool can’t be switched off.

But, after alerting Amazon to the problem, the retailer discovered it was actually a fault in the ‘mosaic’ screensaver feature.

By comparison, this feature is not turned on by default, suggesting why Hayes and only a small number of people appear to have been affected.
