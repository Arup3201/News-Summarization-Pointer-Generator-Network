Other women her age are more likely to be found carrying their weekly shopping in a wheelie trolley or in a basket on the front of a mobility scooter.

But 74-year-old speed-demon Barbel Roerig prefers to whizz around on an altogether different kind of scooter - the fold-up variety typically favoured by children.

As well as attracting admiring glances from fellow OAPs as she zips around Perth, Scotland, on her trusty wheels, young-at-heart Barbel has acquired a global Facebook following after fans began posting pictures of 'Perth Scooter Gran' online.

The Facebook page dedicated to the German pensioner has racked up over 3,000 followers, and Barbel can now boast of fans from as far afield as Colombia, Pakistan and New Zealand.

But the down-to-earth grandmother of two - described as a 'legend' by locals - who moved to Perth in 1971, remains unfazed by the attention.

'I think it's very nice, and now I know what it must feel like for all the famous people in the world,' she said.

Barbel is a familiar sight around the
streets of Bridgend, Perth, and fans have taken to snapping pictures of
the pensioner with their camera phone as she zips past on her scooter.

One man who spots her regularly wrote
on Facebook: 'Scooter Gran you are a legend i often laugh when i see 
you but fair play to u.

Sonya Powell posted simply: 'This is 
great! good on u granny', while Jude Letham wrote: 'Super gran is alive 
and well and living in Perth, respect.'

Another user described seeing the youthful pensioner sporting a bag decorated with the Teenage 
Mutant Ninja Turtles as she scooted past.

'She had a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle bag - a legend, with good taste in cartoons!' the post said.

Barbel, said to be a grandmother of two, has been described as a 'legend' by locals in Perth, Scotland

The creator of the fan page, a 31 year old who goes by the name of The Doctor, said: 'I made the page to celebrate the awesomeness of Perth Scooter Gran after capturing a couple of photos myself, and to give the people of Perth a place to share their sightings of the enigmatic lady.'

'I haven’t had the opportunity to speak to her myself but one of her relatives posted on the page.

'I’m not surprised people are enthusiastic about Scooter Gran - go to any other city in Scotland and you’ll find loads of interesting characters, but the majority of Perth people are too scared to be seen as anything less than ordinary.'
