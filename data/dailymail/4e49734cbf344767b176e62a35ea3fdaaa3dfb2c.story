A body pulled from a canal in New Jersey is believed to be that of missing bartender Sarah Majoras, it was revealed today.

The 39-year-old disappeared after walking home alone from a nightclub, close to the frozen Delaware & Raritan Canal in Lambertville, in the early hours of Saturday.

Prosecutors said the body, which was found in the same stretch of water where her friend died 12 years ago, matches her description, but said formal identification had yet to take place.

Macabre discovery: A body pulled from a canal in New Jersey is thought to be that of missing bartender Sarah Majoras (pictured), who disappeared after walking home alone in the early hours of last Saturday

Fearing the worst: Prosecutors said the body matches the 39-year-old's description, but say formal identification had yet to take place

The discovery came after a boot thought to belong to Majoras was found in the canal and shortly after prosecutor Anthony Kearns made a renewed appeal for information about her disappearance.

Kearns said they were investigating reports Majoras had been approached by a man hours before she was last seen.

Although he said foul play could have been a factor in her death, he said there was no evidence of such as yet, it was reported onÂ www.lehighvalleylive.com.

He has also downplayed any connection
between her disappearance and the death of one of her friends, whose 
body was found in the same canal 12 years ago.

Clue? Prosecutors said they were investigating reports Majoras had been approached by a man hours before she was last seen

In 2000, musician David Anderson, an Ottsville
area native, was reportedly seen on the same path on his way to see Majoras's boyfriend David 
Baker when he fell into the water.

Anderson's death was ruled as accidental.

Messages of condolence have already 
started pouring into the 'Find Sarah Majoras' Facebook page in a sign 
that her friends and loved ones are braced for the worst.

Kearns said her family were 'saddened and heartbroken'.

Workplace: Majoras was last seen after leaving John & Peter's Bar (above), where she had been drinking and listening to music with friends on a night off

Marjoras was last seen on 
surveillance video at about 2am on Saturday crossing into the city from 
New Hope, where she had worked at John & Peter's Bar for 15 years.

Cameras show her turning north onto Lambert Lane and walking toward her home in the 100 block of North Union Street.

She was not working on Friday night, but had been drinking and listening to music with friends.

Her boyfriend Adam Baker called the bar when she did not return home and she was reported missing at around 2pm on Saturday.

Short journey: Miss Majoras was believed to have been walking the one-mile route to her home in the early hours of Saturday when she vanished

Specialist divers have been searching 
the canal every day since her disappearance and a police helicopter has 
also been assisting in the search.

John & Peter's nightclub has also put up her missing poster on their website.

Majoras is described as 5ft 4ins and weighing 140lb.

She has blue eyes, blonde hair and was last seen wearing blue jeans, brown leather boots, white cap and a camouflage jacket.
