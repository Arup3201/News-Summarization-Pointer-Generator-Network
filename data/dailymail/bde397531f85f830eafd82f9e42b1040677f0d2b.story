George Zimmerman has broken his silence, telling the nation of the timeline of events the night Trayvon Martin was shot dead, and saying that he has been vilified into being a racist and a murderer, two things he vehemently denied.

Speaking exclusively to Fox News’ Sean Hannity, Zimmerman recounted the night of February 26 in the gated community in Sanford, Florida, sensationally saying that he did not regret getting out of his car that night.

Throughout the hour-long interview, Zimmerman maintained his composure, sitting for much of it with his hands folded neatly in his lap, and keeping a stoic face.

When asked what he would tell the nation, Zimmerman firmly said, ‘I’m not a racist, and I’m not a murderer.’

No regret: George Zimmerman, left, tells Fox News' Sean Hannity in an exclusive interview that aired Wednesday night that he did not regret being armed or carrying a gun

This is the first time Zimmerman has 
publically spoken about the fateful night, explaining that it was no 
longer a choice for him to reach for the gun once he said Trayvon Martin
 started bashing his head into the sidewalk and noticed his gun.

He said: ‘At that point, I realised 
that it wasn’t my gun, it wasn’t his gun, it was the gun. He said you’re
 going to die tonight, (exploitive). I felt one of his hands going down 
my chest to my bolster. It just happened so quickly.’

Hannity later asked him if he 
regretted getting out of his car initially. Zimmerman said no, then 
saying he didn’t regret being armed, nor his other actions that night, 
adding: ‘I feel that it was all God’s plan. For me to second guess it, 
um…’

However, at the tail end of the 
interview, Zimmerman corrected his first statement saying: ‘I do wish 
there was something, anything I would have done to put me in a position 
where I didn’t have to take his life.’

Evidence: Zimmerman has said that Martin broke his nose and slammed his head into the pavement, which corroborate with the Sanford police department's photos from that night

He said: ‘I do want to tell everyone –
 my wife, my parents, the parents of Trayvon Martin – I’m sorry this 
happened. I hate to think that it’s polarised America.’

In the interview, Hannity also 
touched on several repercussions of that night.

He spoke about how his 
wife, Shellie, is facing criminal charges following Zimmerman’s bond 
hearings.

Hannity asked Zimmerman to walk him 
through the night he shot Trayvon. Zimmerman said he was making his 
weekly trip to Target to buy food.

He also said that unless he was going
 to work, he was always carrying his 9mm gun, which he had obtained 
through the proper channels.

He said he got the gun after an 
August 2011 home invasion scared his wife.

‘It frightened her, shook her
 up,’ he said. ‘I promised I’d do what I could to keep her safe.’

The night Zimmerman said that Trayvon
 was ‘walking very leisurely for the weather.

It didn’t look like he was
 a resident’ or ‘a fitness fanatic who would train in the rain.’ All of 
that, he said, sparked suspicion.

He said that Marin was ‘skipping, 
going away quickly’ and ‘wasn’t running out of fear.’

At that point, the
 former Neighbourhood Watch volunteer said Trayvon came up to him and 
asked him what his problem was.

He said he responded, ‘I don’t have a
 problem,’ and was looking to grab his cell phone again. It was at that 
point, Zimmerman said, that Trayvon punched him squarely in the nose, 
breaking it.

‘I don’t remember if I went immediately to the ground,’ he said, ‘but he started bashing my head into the concrete sidewalk.’

All the while, Zimmerman said he was 
screaming for help, again saying that the screams heard on the 911 tapes
 were his. ‘It was my voice, absolutely,’ he said.

Throughout the interview, Zimmerman’s 
attorney, Mark O’Mara sat beside his client, listening, and at one point
 taking a moment to say that with all the evidence presented, 
Zimmerman’s second-degree murder charge should be dropped to 
manslaughter.

He told Hannity that if given the chance, he would ‘tell them that, again, I’m sorry.’

He continued: ‘I’m sorry that they buried their child. I can’t imagine what it must feel like. And I pray for them daily.’

The interview comes one day after it was
 revealed that Zimmerman and his wife blew through $36,000 of cash he 
raised from his online legal defense fund on personal expenses like car 
payments, cell phones and paying off credit card debt -- even though he 
was in jail at the time.

He went into hiding because he received 
thousands of death threats after he was initially not arrested because 
he claimed he opened fire on the unarmed teen in self defense.

'Zimmerman will open up about what happened the night of Trayvon Martin’s death and his experience in the aftermath of the fatal shooting,' Fox News says.

The hour-long interview will air tonight at 9pm on Fox News. Zimmerman appeared alongside his lawyer, Mark O'Mara, and talked about what led up to and what followed the shooting.

The interview is the culmination of several months of work by Hannity to land the exclusive interview.

In April, at the height over the public uproar over the shooting, Zimmerman called Hannity and had an off-the-record conversation with him. The details of the call have never been made public.

The interview is also expected to discuss the $200,000 in donations he received from supporters via a PayPal he set up on his site therealgeorgezimmerman.com.

Court filings from O'Mara show that in 18 days, Zimmerman and his wife spent $36,000 to pay off credit card bills, buy phones, make car payments and pay for an Internet connection -- all of it while he was still in jail.

Among the expenses were $600 in jailhouse phone calls. Zimmerman, 28, spent three to five hours a day on the phone while he was in jail -- placing an average of 13 calls to friends and family each day, the Orlando Sentinel reports.

In many of those calls Zimmerman used code to talk about money, especially from the PayPal account. The biggest single chunk of money was a $5,000 payment for Zimmerman's first bail, which was set at $150,000.

However, the couple spent $7,000 to pay 
down credit card bills -- $4,000 on their America Express bill alone. 
O'Mara says the bills were for expenses the Zimmerman incurred when they
 had to flee their home after they began receiving death threats.
