Privacy campaigners have attacked Google after the search giant claimed it was immune to British law.

The US company is accused of illegally snooping on its British customers by bypassing privacy settings on Apple devices, such as iPads, to track their browsing history.

A group of Britons has taken the firm to court over the claims, but Google is now trying to have the case thrown out.

It claims it is not subject to British privacy law because it is based in California – prompting outrage from campaigners.

The firm has already come under fire for failing to pay tax in the UK, and critics said the latest row was further evidence of Google making up the rules to suit itself.

Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch, said: ‘It is deeply worrying for a company with millions of British users to be brazenly saying they do not regard themselves bound by UK law.

‘Regulators need to step up and ensure that when citizens are illegally tracked against their wishes, the companies riding roughshod over their privacy is held to account.’

Solicitor Dan Tench, of law firm Olswang, said: ‘Google has a substantial presence here and earns substantial revenues here.

‘This is yet another instance of Google being here when it suits them and not being here when it doesn’t.’

The case centres on Apple’s internet 
browser, Safari. It is automatically set up to block ‘cookies’, which 
enable internet firms such as Google to track users’ browsing behaviour 
and sell the information to advertisers. But Google circumvented the 
privacy setting without informing users.

The practice was halted after it came to light in the US. Google subsequently had to pay a $22.5million (£14.4million) fine to regulators.

More than 100 Apple customers in Britain are now taking legal action against Google, and seeking compensation.

But yesterday their lawyers revealed Google is arguing that British courts have ‘no jurisdiction’ over the firm, as its services are based in California.

It also argues that information it gleans from people carrying out internet searches cannot be deemed ‘private or confidential’.

Among the claimants is retired magazine editor Judith Vidal-Hall, 75, from West London. She claims she began receiving phone calls and emails from companies after using Google searches to buy Christmas presents for her family.

In July the Information Commissioner's Office told Google its privacy rules breached UK law

Fellow claimant Marc Bradshaw said action by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the UK regulator, was pointless because all it could do was fine Google – one of the world’s richest companies.

In July the ICO told Google its privacy rules breached UK law. But the maximum fine the ICO can impose is £500,000.

‘It seems to us absurd to suggest that consumers can’t bring a claim against a company which is operating in the UK and is even constructing a $1billion headquarters in London,’ Mr Bradshaw said.

‘If consumers can’t bring a civil claim against a company in a country where it operates, the only way of ensuring it behaves is by having a robust regulator.’

Google’s attempt to throw out the privacy claim will be heard in October. The firm declined to comment last night.
