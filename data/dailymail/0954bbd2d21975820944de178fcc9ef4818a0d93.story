Witnesses told the New York Post that they heard someone scream 'F*** you' before shots rang out around 2:40pm at the location on West 23rd Street in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood.  

A source told the Daily Mail Online that the shooting took place in the lighting section of the store.

They described how the suspect was chatting to one employee, saw his old boss, pulled the gun and fired. 

Some of the shoppers in the store were said to be stocking up for the blizzards that have been forecast over the next few days.  

A 50-year-old Bronx resident told the Daily News that he was an aisle away from where the shooting happened, and that store employees gave him an explanation for what caused the dispute.

'From what I'm hearing from employees it was a disgruntled worker who came to shoot his supervisor after he got fired,' the man told the Daily News.

Shoppers who were in the store at the time, many preparing for an expected snow storm, dove to the floor or hid behind aisles before SWAT teams led an evacuation so they could comb the scene.

A store employee told the Post that one of the victims was a co-worker who had just returned from a trip to visit his wife and child in France.

'I heard about some shots towards the back of the store. It sounded like 4 or 5 shots. 

'I heard someone yell, 'Oh, my God, he's dead!' It was on the main floor near the lighting department.

'What is the world coming to? This is so beyond words. Everyone was running and screaming and ducking,' the employee said.

Sigourney Rodriguez, who works nearby, was taking a cigarette break when she saw about 100 people running out of the store. 'You hear gunshots, you're going to run,' she said.
