In what has been a weekend featuring many surprise results in the FA Cup fourth round, there is little doubt that Bradford’s win at Chelsea is by far the stand-out upset.

The Bantams’ stunning performance to come from 2-0 and win 4-2 at the Premier League leaders is sure to be remembered for years to come, but where does it stack against the all-time biggest shocks?

Sportsmail looks back on ten of the biggest upsets in the history of the FA Cup, but has the League One side’s fourth round heroics bettered them all?

The Bradford squad celebrate their famous FA Cup fourth round win at Stamford Bridge on Saturday 

10) Norwich City 0-1 Luton Town (2013)

The booming success of the Premier League since its inception in 1992 has led to the gaps between the top flight and lower league teams increasing – financially at the very least.

But Luton Town proved that money is not a certainty to success as they became the first ever non-league club to defeat a Premier League side when they sent Norwich packing in the fourth round.

They didn’t even need a bobbly pitch to do it on as well, with Scott Rendell’s 80th minute strike enough to stun everyone watching inside Carrow Road.

9) Leyton Orient 3-2 Chelsea (1972)

So it turns out Chelsea have previous when it comes to throwing away two-goal leads in the FA Cup against lower league teams.

The Blues turned up at Brisbane Road with stars such as David Webb, Ron Harris, Peter Osgood and Peter Bonetti – with Webb and Osgood opening the scoring.

But Orient fought back and before half-time Phil Hoadley lashed home from 25 yards to make it 2-1. Mickey Bullock equalised to start a mini-pitch invasion before Barrie Fairbrother took advantage of a defensive mix-up late on to seal a famous fifth round win.

8) Manchester City 0-1 Wigan (2013)

The new Wembley hasn’t seen many classic FA Cup matches since staging its first in 2007 but it did deliver a huge upset back in 2013.

Roberto Mancini was expected to deliver a consolation prize in the Cup having seen his Manchester City team stumble behind Manchester United in the race for the Premier League title.

But Wigan had other ideas as Ben Watson pounced to score a stoppage-time header and win the Latics their first ever major piece of silverware.

Three days later, Wigan lost 4-1 at Arsenal and became the first team to win the FA Cup and be relegated in the same season.

7) Sutton 2-1 Coventry (1989)

Before Luton defeated Norwich, you had to go back to 1989 for the last time a non-League club embarrassed a top-flight side by eliminating them from the Cup.

Coventry had performed an upset of their own two years previously by beating Tottenham to win the 1987 FA Cup, but the boot was soon on the other foot when Tony Rains fired Sutton in front before half-time in a third-round tie.

David Phillips equalised for the Sky Blues after the restart but Matthew Hanlan helped restore the lead before the hour mark as the non-league side held on in front of 8,000 fans to seal a famous win.

6) Sunderland 1-0 Leeds (1973)

Mighty Leeds were huge favourites against Second Division Sunderland but one of the great defensive and goalkeeping displays helped serve up one of the most memorable finals – even for a 1-0.

Ian Porterfield’s first half strike put Sunderland ahead, and Leeds responded by throwing just about everything at goalkeeper Jim Montgomery – whose heroics in the game peaked with an amazing double save.

Sunderland held on and manager Bob Stokoe’s famous run on to the pitch at the full time whistle has been turned into a statue outside the Stadium of Light.

5) Colchester 3-2 Leeds (1971) 

Another Leeds defeat, just two years prior to their upset against Sunderland. This time it was lowly Colchester who provided the drama.

There are stories of the minnows sending an injured player north to watch Leeds train in the week leading up to the match, of them putting in extra seats close to the pitch to pile the pressure on their mighty first division opponents.

This was a proper Cup upset. Ray Crawford scored twice before Dave Simmons put Colchester 3-0 up. Something stirred in Leeds and they fought back to 3-2, but fourth division Colchester held on for a famous victory.

4) Liverpool 0-1 Wimbledon (1988)

‘The Crazy Gang have beaten the Culture Club!’ declared commentator John Motson, after Wimbledon’s rapid rise up the Football League reached its peak in 1988.

Top guns Liverpool were huge favourites against their First Division rivals in the final, but could do nothing to prevent Lawrie Sanchez heading the Dons in front.

Normal order looked set to be resumed when they won a second-half penalty but Wimbledon keeper Dave Beasant became the first keeper to save a spot-kick in a Cup final when he kept out John Aldridge’s 12-yard effort.

3) Bournemouth 2-0 Manchester United (1984)

It looked like a straight forward win for Manchester United when they were drawn away to Bournemouth – then of the Third Division – in the third round of the Cup.

Ron Atkinson’s team were the holders but didn’t look it as Harry Redknapp’s side battled to a stunning win at Dean Court.

Milton Graham and Ian Thompson were the goal scorers. Even Redknapp was left lost for words as he simply declared after the game: ‘We don't get many days like this in Bournemouth.’

2) Wrexham 2-1 Arsenal (1992)

It should never have been a contest. It was second in the First Division against bottom of the entire Football League. The champions of the country against the lower league minnows.

And when Alan Smith fired Arsenal ahead at the Racecourse Ground, the Gunners looked like they were set for an easy afternoon in the third round.

But with 10 minutes to go, the ‘magic of the cup’ kicked up something special. The 37-year-old Mickey Thomas fired home a 25-yard free-kick past David Seaman before Steve Watkin popped up to net a late winner and send George Graham’s side crashing out in dramatic circumstances.

1) Hereford United 2-1 Newcastle United (1972)

Sadly Hereford United recently folded, but they will forever be immortalised in the form of Ronnie Radford’s spectacular strike against Newcastle which is standard inclusion for just about any FA Cup montage.

The Southern League side had already earned a replay at St James’ Park with a 2-2 draw but looked like they had met their match when Malcolm Macdonald gave the Toon the lead with eight minutes to play at Edgar Street.

Radford’s 40-yard screamer three minutes later brought the game level before substitute Rickey George scored in extra time to fire the non-league side into the fourth round in one of the biggest shocks of all-time.
