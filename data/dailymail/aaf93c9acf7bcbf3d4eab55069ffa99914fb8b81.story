Marcus Bebb-Jones, 49, admitted murdering his wife in America 16 years ago and dumping her body in a Colorado national park

A British poker champion has admitted murdering his wife in America 16 years ago, court officials confirmed today.

Marcus Bebb-Jones pleaded guilty to murdering his wife Sabrina in 1997 before dumping her body in a Colorado national park.

The couple owned the Melrose Hotel in Grand Junction, Colorado, when Mrs Bebb-Jones disappeared.

Her skull was found by a rancher in 2004 in a national park near Douglas Pass in north-west Colorado.

Professional gambler Bebb-Jones was arrested in 2009 in a raid at his home in Kidderminster, Worcestershire.

Following his wife's disappearance he went to Las Vegas and spent thousands of dollars on her credit cards, prosecutors claim.

He then shot himself in the head in a botched suicide attempt.

He moved back to the UK with their son, who was three at the time.

The 49-year-old lost his appeal against extradition to the US in 2011.

On Friday, at a hearing in the 9th Judicial District Court in Glenwood Springs, Colorado, Bebb-Jones admitted the murder, officials said.

He is due to be sentenced in May and could be jailed for up to 20 years.

Sheri Caloia, district attorney in Garfield County, said he had pleaded guilty to second degree murder using a plea bargain.

She told the BBC: 'Since the skull was discovered it's taken three and a half years to bring [the case] to fruition.'

Ms Caloia said Bebb-Jones is expected
to explain in more detail the circumstances surrounding the murder 
after blaming it on 'heat of passion'.

Bebb-Jones won thousands of pounds on the poker playing circuit and won the Grosvenor Grand Prix in 2007.
