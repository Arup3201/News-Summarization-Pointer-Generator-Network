It is the erotic thriller that has had blushing women rushing to the book store for their fix of 'mummy porn.'

And it seems that readers really are taking inspiration from the best-selling British book with couples now having three times as much sex thanks to the sizzling page-turner.

Researchers found on average women slept with their partners just once a week before reading the book, but this leapt to three times every week once they finished the erotic read.

Couples are now enjoying more sex each week and are incorporating new positions into their sex lives thanks to Fifty Shades of Grey

One in eight women now bed their other half every day, up from just three per cent this time last year, the study for Netmums.com found.

And the nation’s sex sessions are lasting longer too - with men enjoying on average an extra 26 hours of sex a year.

Two-thirds of women said reading the book made their lovemaking last longer, with the average session now taking 15 minutes more.

With one in 25 couples enjoying romps an extra hour long.

The best-selling erotic novel has boosted sales of sex toys and Ann Summers have even launched 'Fifty Shades of Grey' sex parties

Couples have also been inspired to use extra sex positions after reading the sexually adventurous book.

Previously one in eight used just one position each time they made love and now over 40 per cent of couples cram in five or more positions each time they have sex.

The UK’s favourite sex position is now the ‘Reverse Cowgirl’, replacing the tamer ‘Doggy Style’ which couples favoured before finishing the steamy read.

Overall 64 per cent of women said the sizzling page-turner had made them more sexually adventurous, while 54 per cent said the boost to their love life had made them emotionally closer to their partner too.

The raunchy read also sparked a baby boom with one in 33 women who read it ending up pregnant and a further nine per cent using the book to tempt their man into more sex in a bid to fall pregnant.

A third of girls fell pregnant in the very first month they started reading the book, with a further 42 per cent pregnant the month after.

Of the 2,183 women polled by Netmums, nearly half (49 per cent) said their partner was delighted they read the book as it spiced up their sex life and eight per cent of men have actually read it. But one in nine (11 per cent) had been banned from reading the book by their partners, with three per cent claiming their men said it was ‘disgusting’.

Two in five women also bought sex toys or visited a sex shop after reading the book.

The most popular purchases were blindfolds, handcuffs and vibrators with half trying these - while an adventurous one in five snapped up bondage ties, sex balls, whips and paddles.

Half found out about the read from friends while one in 20 were told by other mums at the school gate - and seven per cent heard about it from their own mother.

The erotic book recently overtook the Highway Code to be the bestselling British book of all time. Brits have bought over five million copies of the tome that traces the relationship between naive college graduate Anastasia Steele and possessive billionaire Christian Grey.

Dubbed ‘Mummy Porn’ the book has been
so successful London-based author E L James is thought to make over a 
million a week from sales.

Netmums
founder Siobhan Freegard said: 'It’s not called Mummy Porn for nothing.
The book has set Britain’s sex lives on fire with even worn-out mums 
finding much more time to make love.

It is thought that author EL James is netting £1mil each week for the best-selling novel which many credit for invigorating their sex lives

'It’s a phenomenon which has put a smile on millions of women’s faces - and the twinkle back in their partner’s eyes.

'But it’s also interesting to see how reading the book and spicing up your sex life can make you emotionally closer to your partner. Here’s hoping the 50 Shades effect will see couples grow stronger together and well as having more fun in the sack.'

An Ann Summers spokeswoman said: 'We could not agree more with these stats - enquiries in-store and at parties have increased 10-fold and we are inundated with demands for themed 50 Shades of Grey parties.

'We are struggling to keep up with demand. Jiggle balls come in and they fly out again. This has helped women feel more sexy and confident in the bedroom and the nation is loving it!'
