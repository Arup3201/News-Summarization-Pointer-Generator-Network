Ever since David Beckham was snapped running around Los Angeles in his underpants filming his new H&M campaign, the women of the world have been eagerly awaiting the results.

Now they need wait no longer as today sees the launch of the new Guy Ritchie-directed TV advert - due to hit the small screen at 9.50pm this evening.

The film kicks off with Beckham waving goodbye to his three sons in his dressing gown, only for it to be shut in the door of the car.

Scroll down for video

Oh pants! Beckham realises the car has driven off with his dressing gown shut in the door

Athletic: He sprints off in pursuit, vaulting over hedges and running through a tennis court in the process

That's torn it! Unfortunately for Becks, cotton vests and hedges don't mix well and the star is left topless

Stripped down: David makes a dash across a Los Angeles garden in his skimpy green boxers

As the car drives off, the dressing gown is pulled away, leaving Beckham clad only in a vest and tight pair of pants.

A chase ensues with Beckham losing his vest (but not his slippers) in the process, thanks to some athletic hedge-vaulting and a dip in one of his neighbour's pools.

Unfortunately for Becks, he doesn't quite manage to catch up with his dressing gown and comes to a halt in front of a tour bus filled with Japanese tourists, who, as one, whip out a phalanx of cameras.

Beckham, 37, is no stranger to modelling and has starred in campaigns for H&M, Armani and Police sunglasses - most of which have required him to remove his top.

But his latest campaign appears to be among his favourites, with the footballer singing the praises of director Guy Ritchie.

Diver: While Beckham might not be much of a diver on the field, he proves adept off it

Uh oh... Becks screeches to a halt, only to discover a bus crammed with Japanese tourists pulling up

As he looks around, the tourists whip out their cameras to record a moment they (and we) won't forget

Speaking about the RocknRolla director, Beckham said: 'Working with Guy has been a fantastic experience.

'I hope everyone has as much fun watching the film as I had making it.'

Director Ritchie seemed equally enamoured, saying: 'David makes the perfect leading man,

'For me this felt more than a campaign – it was like directing a short film.'

The film debut coincides with new colours added to the Bodywear range 
just in time for Valentine’s Day, including red and blue trims, and 
underwear in utility tones.

The
soccer star-turned-underwear model first debuted his Bodywear 
collection for the high street chain in February 2011 with a TV 
commercial during the Superbowl which he said was 'embarrassing' for him
to watch.

Who's a pretty boy then? Beckham has his locks tucked into place on the Los Angeles set

Relaxed: Director Guy Ritchie and David Beckham wait for preparations on set to be completed

Cool dude: Beckham strikes a pose in his black vest and proves that  he really does look good in everything

Life behind the lens: David and Guy admire their work on set in Beverly Hills

Pals: The two, pictured having a whale of a time on set, say they got on like a house on fire
