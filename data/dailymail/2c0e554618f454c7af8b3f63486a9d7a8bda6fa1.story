Jamie Farrell, 30, was left with gaping wounds exposing his right arm to the bone after being attacked

A father feared he would lose his arm after he was savagely attacked by a dog being walked by a six-year-old boy. 

Jamie Farrell, 30, was left with gaping wounds exposing his right arm to the bone after being attacked in Bradford, West Yorkshire.

The Japanese Akita latched on to the joiner's forearm as he went to fetch tools from his van on Thursday, leaving him to fend off the animal with his bare hands.

Mr Farrell, 27, said: 'I was working on a house and I went outside to get some more tools.

'As I got to the bottom of the garden path, the dog came from nowhere and went straight for me. There was nothing to provoke it, it was just angry.

'I thought it was going to pull my arm off. I had to grab hold of its neck with my other hand and literally pull it off me so it would let go.

'It went for my leg, and when I got it off me again it went back for my arm. I was bleeding all over the place, I thought it was going to finish me off.

'I got back into the house and was given towels to stop the blood. It was scary.'

The dog was being walked on a lead by a six-year-old boy when it broke loose and attacked Mr Farrell.

It is believed the child managed to get the dog back under control following the attack, but Mr Farrell is calling for it to be destroyed.

He said: 'I want the dog to be put down, because if it did what it did to me to a child, they would never survive.

'With the size of the little lad who was out with it, he didn’t have a chance of stopping what it did to me.

'I’ve got children and I would hate to think they would come into contact with a dog like that.'

Mr Farrell, who lives in East Bierley, Bradford, West Yorks, with his wife Joanne, 25, three-year-old daughter and 11-month-old son, remains in hospital at Bradford Royal Infirmary following surgery and skin grafts to repair his arm.

On Thursday, he underwent an initial operation to clean the deep wounds he suffered and last night  he had follow up surgery to try and repair the injuries, which could leave him scarred for life.

'My arm is my livelihood,' said Mr Farrell. 'I need it to do my job and look after my family.

'I like dogs, I grew up with them and I’ve had Labradors and Dobermans. A neighbour had Rottweilers and Akitas before and I’ve always got on with them. 

'My arm is my livelihood,' said Mr Farrell. 'I need it to do my job and look after my family'

'I’ve still got my arm but I can’t move it much. I’m waiting to see what the doctors say,' he said

'I didn’t do anything to provoke the dog that went for me, it happened so quickly. I feel sick about it.

'I’ve still got my arm but I can’t move it much. I’m waiting to see what the doctors say.'

Mr Farrell is expected to return home tomorrow.

He added: 'I just want to get on the mend and get home. My daughter’s missing me - she knows that it was a nasty dog that did this.

'We’re waiting to hear from the police what’s happening against this dog. I’ve got nothing against Akitas but they have got to be controlled.'

The dog was being walked on a lead by a six-year-old boy down Pollard Lane in Bradford (pictured) when it broke loose and attacked Mr Farrell.

Sergeant Rick Newton, of the Bowling and Barkerend Neighbourhood Policing Team, said officers were called by paramedics after reports of a man being bitten by a dog at about 4.30pm on Thursday.

He said: 'The man was taken to hospital with arm injuries, while officers made inquiries as to who owned the animal. Inquiries are now ongoing to establish whether any offences have occurred.'

The Japanese Akita that attacked Jamie Farrell has now been seized by police.

Inspector George Bardell, who leads the Bradford East Area Neighbourhood Teams said:

'At around 6pm yesterday, officers attended an address in Pollard Lane, Bradford and executed a warrant to seize a Japanese Akita dog.

'Enquiries are now ongoing to establish who is responsible for the animal.

'Anyone with information is asked to contact the Bowling and Barkerend Neighbourhood Policing Team on 101.'
