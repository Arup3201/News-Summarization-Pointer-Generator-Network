This snake could have chosen anywhere to try and swallow a live frog - so of course, it picked the 17th hole of a busy golf course.

Players were stunned to see the spectacle of nature's brutality last week in the calm surroundings of Thornbury Golf Club in South Gloucestershire.  

Seniors captain Lindsey Henniker-Heaton, 68, was putting on the 10th green when his friend Philip McMenamin called him over to the 17th.

Whole in one: This grass snake assailed a frog on the 17th hole of Thornbury Golf Club in South Gloucestershire

Slippery player: Golfers still went about their business amid the spectacle of nature red in tooth and... scales

The pair arrived to find the 3ft grass snake trying to swallow the frog whole.

As Mr Henniker-Heaton drew his iPhone, the frog - which he had assumed was dead - kicked into life and escaped the snake's jaws. 

'I was playing a pairs match against Bristol Golf Club when Philip came running over to see if I had a camera,' he said.

'I lay down on the green and managed to get a photograph of the both the frog’s and the snake’s eyes.

'The frog looked dormant and Philip thought it might be dead, but then I saw its throat move.

'The frog croaked into life and managed to jump out. It looked tired and Philip picked it up and put it in the grass nearby. 

'I have never seen anything like it on the golf course.' 

An amphibians expert from Dartfrog, a shop and breeding centre in Bayton, Worcestershire, told MailOnline the lucky animal was a Common or European brown frog (Rana temporaria), which is native to Britain.

Measuring up to 6ft long grass snakes
 are the largest species of snake in Britain, but unlike adders they are
 not venomous.

They pose no threat to humans but they are dangerous to the small animals on which they feast because of their speed and quick reflexes.

As the only species of snake in Britain to lay eggs, they have jaws big enough to regularly swallow small animals whole. But they are preyed on too, and play dead when cornered by predators.

The
snakes subsist mainly on amphibious 
animals like frogs, toads and newts, as well as the occasional fish.

They also have a preference for birdies.

Their feelings towards bogeys remain unknown, but are presumably not positive.
