Failed to pay fines and said they would rather go to jail

A group of Amish men were sent to jail today for refusing to pay fines for breaking a state highway law that requires their horse-drawn buggies to be marked with orange reflective triangles.

The men, from western Kentucky, have a religious objection to the bright orange signs, which they say are flashy and conflict with their pledge to live low-key and religious lives.

Ananias Byler, the first of ten Amish men due in Graves County District Court on Thursday, was sentenced to ten days in jail.

Jail time: These Amish men were arrested for 
refusing to put go-slow triangular safety signs on their buggies, 
despite a Kentucky state law that requires all slow-moving vehicles to 
display the orange badges

Refusal: The men are going to jail for not putting orange reflective stickers on their Amish buggies and refusing to pay fines for not doing so

The men were jailed for being found in contempt of court for refusing to pay the fines.

Byler told Judge Deborah Crooks on Thursday that he would not pay the $489 he owes.

'I totally understand your objection,' the judge told Byler. 'But you're in violation, and it's not up to me to change the law. It doesn't really matter what I think about any of this.'

The men belong to a conservative breakaway group of Amish known as Swartzentruber. They live simply, with no electricity, plumbing or appliances.

But in recent years they have been running afoul of the law for refusing to use the triangles on their buggies, and some were sent to jail last year.

Not all Amish groups refuse to use the reflective signs on their carts. But the Swartzentruber community is refusing to put its trust in man-made symbols for their safety.

'I don’t think it’s right to put somebody in jail for practising their religious beliefs,’ said Amish father-of-seven Levi Zook. 'But that’s what we’ll do if that’s what it takes to abide by the Biblical laws.'

The men did win one battle during their time in jail - being given sombre blue prison uniforms instead of the regulation bright orange jumpsuits.

The Amish men, wearing long dark coats on a snowy day in Mayfield, removed their black wide-brimmed hats before entering the courtroom.

They sat quietly until their names were called.

Jacob Gingerich said he and the other men will continue to refuse to pay the fines.

Gingerich owed the most, $627, and was sentenced to 13 days in jail on Thursday.

'We're just not going to pay,' Gingerich, a farmer with 12 children, said before the court appearance.

Police and prosecutors say the orange triangles help motorists see the buggies and avoid collisions.

'You get behind one of the buggies at night, you can't see it,' Graves County Sheriff DeWayne Redmon said.

'We're citing them for their own safety as well as the safety of others.'

Gingerich and two other Amish men, with help from the Kentucky chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, have sued over the state highway law, saying it infringes on their religious freedom.

The Kentucky Supreme Court has agreed to hear the case later this year after the state appeals court rejected the Amish men's argument in June.

Gingerich said today that he wished the judge would have waited for the state Supreme Court to hear the case before throwing the men in jail.

In court earlier this year: Five of the Amish men also ccused of aggravated burglary and kidnapping 

Kentucky lawmakers are considering changes to the highway law to allow the Amish to use gray reflective tape instead of the orange triangles.

Of Kentucky's 120 counties, Graves County has recorded the most violations for failure to use the orange triangles in the last five years.

The county has recorded 57 of a total of 89 violations statewide since 2007.

The Amish community has been increasingly thrust into the spotlight in recent months after a spate of beard-cutting attacks took place around Ohio throughout the end of last year, which resulted in the arrest of a number of men from the Bergholz Clan.
