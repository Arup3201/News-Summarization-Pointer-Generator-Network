The steady stream of mothers-to-be to have benefited from her sage advice include A-list actresses and television stars.

Now revered antenatal teacher Christine Hill can add royalty to her illustrious client list, as she revealed she has been helping the Duchess of Cambridge prepare for the imminent birth of her first child.

As the world waits with bated breath for the arrival of Baby Cambridge, the 65-year-old paediatric physiotherapist said royal parents-to-be Kate and William made a 'very strong team'.

Wise words: A-listers, actresses, and now a member of the royal family are among those to have sought the advice of antenatal expert Christine Hill at her London practice

'Very strong team': The legendary antenatal teacher said Kate can rest assured William will be 'doing the right stuff on the day'

'Prince William will be doing the right stuff on the day,' she told the Daily Telegraph.

Although
security fears meant the pregnant Duchess was unable to join one of Ms 
Hill's famed antenatal classes, Kate made two private visits to her 
London practice.

The 
31-year-old, who Ms Hill describes as a 'delightful girl', visited once 
by herself, and once with husband Prince William at her side to to hear 
some wise words from the expert, who is the author of two 
successful books on pregnancy.

It
is perhaps unsurprising that the down to earth young royals chose Ms 
Hill to help them get ready for the life-changing event, as she is 
renowned for her pragmatic, no-nonsense approach.

Ms Hill says few women her prepared for the 'true ghastliness' of birth, has little time for worries about baby weight.

She advises expectant mothers to eat what they want, and says pelvic floor exercises are the only ones necessary during pregnancy.

'I like women lying around in pregnancy - they shouldn't be jogging,' she said.

As for after the baby has arrived, practical Ms Hill says: 'Accept that this is going to change your life, that you will stay in a nightdress for a week.'

Kate Middleton was just in time to secure the services of the paediatric and obstetric physiotherapist, who is now retiring after coaching nearly 6,000 pupils in 35 years of running antenatal classes with her partner Barbara Whiteford.

Preparations: Excitement surrounding William and Kate's (left) first child's impending arrival is building to fever pitch, and the world's press has been camped outside the hospital where she will give birth for days

A press scrum has been gathered for days outside the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, west London, where the Duchess of Cambridge is due to give birth in a private suite.

Excitement over the impending birth has been building to fever pitch since Saturday July 13, which was widely reported to be Kate's due date.

The couple's private office at Kensington Palace has refused to confirm the Duchess's exact due date, although Kate herself let slip during a public walkabout earlier this year that it is 'mid-July'.
