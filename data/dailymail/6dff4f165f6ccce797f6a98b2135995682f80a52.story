Passengers flying into, or out of Europe, will now be able to use portable electronics including phones and tablets at any time during their flights.

Starting immediately, European-based airlines can, at their own discretion, allow passengers to leave electronics on throughout the entire flight, without putting them into Airplane Mode.

But, airlines will need to certify their planes aren't affected by transmission signals before allowing devices to be used.

The European Aviation Safety Agency in Germany has issued new guidelines. They state that passengers can use portable electronics, including phones and tablets, at any time during flights

They will also need to equip their aircrafts with network connectors to make it possible to get online, for example.

The statement was made by Cologne-based European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).

Spokesman Ilias Maragakis said the plans are a step beyond what's allowed by the US Federal Aviation Administration.

Earlier this year, US security officials introduced mandatory checks for electronic devices on flights.

Under the plans, passengers must be able to power on their phone or table. 

If they can't, then they either can't board the flight, or they have to hand over the gadget. 

In July, ministers in the UK announced these checks on electronic devices would be expanded. 

Checks will apply to passengers flying both in and out of UK. 

Flights involved include those to and from the Middle East and East Africa.

However, reports claim British Airways and Virgin will fund the return of passengers' confiscated devices. 

‘We're basically opening the door where, in theory, you'll be able to continue making your phone call through the gate throughout the flight, like you would on a train.’

British Airways already lets passengers on its business-class flights from London to New York to use Wi-Fi and send texts, and is starting to relax the regulations on other flights as well.

Passengers are not allowed to make voice calls, both other Wi-Fi and through their network, to avoid annoying other passengers.

In addition, there is no network signal at high altitudes.

EASA's previous guidance, from last year, allowed electronic devices for almost the whole flight, so long as they were not transmitting any signals by being put into Airplane Mode.

Similarly, the US Federal Aviation Administration lifted its own restrictions on the use of most personal electronic devices during takeoffs and landings.

This does not include calls, which fall under the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and are prohibited. 

Airlines will need to certify planes aren't affected by transmission signals. They will also need to equip craft with network connectors

Before the FAA's announcement in October, the agency had long barred the use of electronic devices below 10,000 feet (3,000 metres) because of concern they could cause electronic interference with aircraft systems during landings, the phase of flight when accidents are most likely to occur.

Due to differences among fleets and operations, the agency said the implementation will vary among airlines, but the agency expects many carriers will prove to the FAA their planes allow passengers to safely use their devices in airplane mode, gate-to-gate, by the end of the year.

The FAA based its decision on input from a group of experts that included representatives from the airlines, aviation manufacturers, passengers, pilots, flight attendants, and the mobile technology industry.

Maragakis said the new guidance applies to any European-based carrier, no matter where the flight originates.
