The U.S. military officially declared the Iraq War over yesterday after more than eight years of bloodshed.

A ceremony was held at Baghdad’s heavily-fortified airport to mark the withdrawal of American troops, an estimated 4,500 of whom have died in the conflict. Some 100,000 Iraqis are also thought to have lost their lives.

U.S. defence secretary Leon Panetta told his troops they could leave with great pride. ‘After a lot of blood spilled by Iraqis and Americans, the mission of an Iraq that could govern and secure itself has become real,’ he said.

He acknowledged the country faced 
serious challenges from terrorism, sectarian violence, and political and
economic difficulties but insisted America would stand by the Iraqis as
they sought peace and prosperity.

At the sombre occasion, where the 
U.S. flag was taken down, he told his audience of a few hundred troops: 
‘No words, no ceremony can provide full tribute to the sacrifices which 
have brought this day to pass.’

The conflict began in March 2003 when
George W Bush and Tony Blair launched an invasion across the Kuwaiti 
border, ousting Saddam Hussein but failing to find his supposed weapons 
of mass destruction.

In Falluja, a former Al Qaeda 
stronghold, several thousand Iraqis celebrated the withdrawal, burning 
the Stars and Stripes and waving pictures of dead relatives. Elsewhere 
in the country the reaction was more mixed.

Soldiers stand to attention as they are addressed by Mr Panetta. He told them they had made Iraq 'sovereign and independent and able to govern and secure itself'

Many Americans will be delighted to 
have their troops home. With its huge expense of more than £515billion, 
dubious causes and post-war blunders, the Iraq conflict has been the 
most unpopular U.S. military venture since the Vietnam War.

Has the U.S. mission in Iraq been a success?

The last 4,000 American troops will 
withdraw by the end of the year despite fears that Iraq’s military will 
not be able to cope alone with the continuing insurgency.

One of the biggest mistakes following
the ousting of Saddam was to dismantle his army, and senior U.S. 
officers doubt Iraq’s ability to defend its own soil or even its 
valuable oil rigs in the Persian Gulf.

Washington wanted 3,000 troops to 
stay on as part of a deal to train the Iraqi armed forces but talks fell
apart over demands for American soldiers to have immunity from 
prosecution over any abuses.

On Wednesday, President Obama marked the end of the war by praising the ‘extraordinary achievement’ of U.S. troops.

Most Iraqis were happy to see the back of Saddam Hussein but say their lives today are just as bad for different reasons.

Under the brutal dictator it was possible to walk the streets of Baghdad and other Iraqi cities in safety – as long as you did not actively oppose his rule.

But now there is little security. Violence is rampant, even if it has declined since the terrible sectarian bloodletting in the middle of the last decade.

Much as most Iraqis detested the 
American invasion and occupation, many fear the security situation will 
deteriorate further after the withdrawal of U.S. troops. And despite 
Iraq’s immense oil wealth, its people struggle with daily power cuts. 
There are also  water shortages.

Unemployment is high and many 
complain of massive corruption. The faction-ridden Iraqi government is 
widely seen as unstable and incompetent.

One Iraqi told the BBC that ‘at least before 2003, there was one bad guy, Saddam Hussein’ but now there are many.

Al Qaeda has a foothold in Iraq which
it never did while Saddam ruled – he reviled Osama Bin Laden’s network,
which in turn despised his ‘godless’ regime. And militant Shia groups, 
brutally suppressed by Saddam’s henchmen, are now flexing their muscles.

Iraq’s Kurds in the north of the country, however, benefited  significantly from the American-led invasion.

Persecuted terribly under Saddam, they now mostly run their own affairs and their oil-rich economy is thriving.

But many Iraqis fear their country is
fragmenting along sectarian lines, with Shias, Sunnis and Kurds all 
vying for a share of the spoils.

And Iraq’s rival neighbours, Iran, 
Turkey and Saudi Arabia, are all lining up to back their different 
interests in Iraq, a key state at the heart of the volatile Middle East.
