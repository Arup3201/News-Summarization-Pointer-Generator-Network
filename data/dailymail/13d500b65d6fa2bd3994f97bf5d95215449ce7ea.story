Passengers on a Detroit bus were recently witness to a shocking no holds barred fight between the driver and a belligerent member of the public.

According to one witness, the incident happened after the unnamed passenger lost her cool when her ticket got stuck in the machine as she attempted to transfer.

The unruly passenger then started to argue with the driver, demanding her ticket back and even spat at the driver.

Seconds out, Round 1: Witnesses claim the passenger started arguing with the driver, demanding her ticket back and even spitting

That proved to be the final straw for the driver who, dressed in her white work shirt, got up from her seat and lunged at the passenger.

Video footage shows the driver hit the passenger around the head, using her keys as a weapon, while the passenger pulls on the driver's hair.

For several minutes the pair battled each other using a variety of boxing, wrestling and even mixed martial arts moves.

At one stage another passenger attempted to get between the warring women and breakup the disagreement, but without any backup he decided to leave the pair to get on with it.

Other passengers actually egged on the women as they punched, kicked and clawed at each other.

Eventually, the driver pined the passenger down and bystander finally helped to break them up before either got further injuries. The unruly passenger was then forced off the bus.

The police arrived, but the fight had already been broken up and passengers were moved to a different bus.

The president of the bus drivers’ union in Detroit, Fred Westbrook, told FOX2 that the driver required stitches for bite marks, cuts and lacerations.

He claims his union member was defending herself and shouldn’t face disciplinary action. An investigation is currently underway.

Police are believed to have arrested the unruly passenger and are also investigating the fight.

According to Westbrook, eight of his drivers have needed hospitalization this year, including this particular driver who was admitted for injuries sustained in a previous incident.

The passenger who attempted to break up the fight, Christoper Jackson, told Fox he was disappointed that no one wanted to help when he stepped in between the two warring women.
