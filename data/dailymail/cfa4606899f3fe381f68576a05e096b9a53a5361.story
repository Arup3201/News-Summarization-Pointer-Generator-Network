They were adopted into a life of bitter custody disputes and murderous affairs, but the Ammon twins have said they are thankful a wealthy U.S. couple took them in otherwise they would have died in a Ukrainian orphanage.

Greg and Alexa Ammon, now 22, were adopted as children by multimillionaire financier Ted Ammon and his wife Generosa and whisked away to the couple's luxurious mansion in the East Hamptons.

But years later, the twins were 
left without parents for a second time after their mother's lover bludgeoned their father to death in October 2011 and she died two years later from breast cancer.

Despite enduring tragedies which graced the pages of newspapers across the country for years, the twins said they are grateful to the Ammons.

Thankful: Greg and Alexa Ammon, 22, have made a documentary revealing the torment they suffered after the murder of their father by their mother's lover in 2001 - but said the family saved them

'I'm thankful for all that my parents 
gave us,' Alexa told People Magazine. 'If they hadn't adopted me, I probably would have died in the 
orphanage. They literally gave me life.'

The Ammon twins, who grew apart and moved to opposite coasts following the tragedies, have now returned to the house where their father was murdered as part of a documentary about their lives.

'We had to face our fears, face the house, face the bedroom and everything that happened there,' Greg told People Magazine.

They
revisit the family home, which they still own, in the film, and recall 
the months of emotional abuse from their mother as their parents went 
through a bitter divorce.

Saved: The children had been adopted by the wealthy couple from an orphanage in the Ukraine

She would make them steal documents 
from their father and then allow them to watch television as a reward. 
But if they said they had had fun with him, they would be sent directly 
to their room.

'I remember Mom, but all I remember are the bad things,' Greg says in the film.

The twins, then 11, were at their father's house in Manhattan when the 52-year-old was killed in the bedroom of their home, as he continued to fight the divorce and custody battles with his wife.

The twins recalled the moment they learned of his death in their documentary, 59 Middle Lane.

'You wake up in the morning, get dressed
like a normal day and Aunt Sandi comes in, and Aunt Sandi, of course, 
lives in Alabama, and we are like why are you here,' Greg recalled.

At the time of his death, the Ammons 
had not finalised their divorce and Ted had yet to re-write his will, 
leaving his estranged wife with half of his fortune, estimated to be 
around $80 million.

Old life: In the film, they return to the Ukrainian orphanage and say they'd have died if they were not adopted

Her lover, an electrician from Long Island named Danny Pelosi, was suspected of the murder but lived as a free man for years - and the twins admitted they loved him.

Murdered: In October 2001, Ted Ammon was found bludgeoned to death at their Hamptons home

'When Danny entered our lives, it was amazing to have a new man to take us out and play baseball with us,' Alexa said.

Three
months after Ted Ammon was murdered, Pelosi divorced his wife and 
married Generosa. They lived in Ammon's mansion before moving to 
Pelosi's home in Long Island.

Generosa had little time to enjoy her former husband's wealth, however, as she was diagnosed with breast cancer and died in August 2003. The children went to live with their aunt in Alabama.

Pelosi, who had been battling for a 
part of the fortune left by his late wife, was eventually arrested in 
March 2004 and was found guilty of murder.

He has maintained that Generosa hired a hit man to kill her husband. He will not be eligible for parole until 2031.

When they faced him in court, aged 14, the twins were unforgiving towards the man they once loved.

'I hope you suffer and go through 
just as much as my sister and I have,' Greg said at his sentencing, the New York Post reported. 'I just hope God can forgive you, because I certainly won’t.'

'It's hard to realise that the person 
you loved stabbed you in the back and ruined the rest of your life. You 
are a sick man, and I regret every single time I said I loved you.'

Scene: In the film, the twins return to the bedroom where he was found after being tortured and killed

Lavish: They still own the mansion in East Hampton where their father was found dead

His sister added: 'Mr. Pelosi might have had a nice time 
for the past couple of years spending my parents' money, but that is 
over now, and I hope he rots away in prison because he deserves nothing 
better.'

Greg eventually moved to Los Angeles and started a film production company while Alexa managed a band in South Carolina - but came back together to film the documentary for closure.

The twins, who inherited $1 
million each after taxes and attorneys' fees, also decided to use the 
opportunity of the documentary to find their biological family in the Ukraine.

Searching
through documents at the mansion, they find papers leading them to the 
orphanage from where they were adopted as malnourished 
children.

They learn that 
they were the result of a one-night tryst between their mother and a 
soldier. The government then took them from their mother as she 
struggled with alcoholism and mental problems.

Emotion: Greg reveals they made the documentary for closure 'to end all the horrible things that happened'

Killer: Daniel Pelosi was arrested for the murder in 2004 and will not be eligible for parole until 2031. He married Generosa Ammon three months after the death of her husband

She was also a prostitute, who begged for money on the streets to buy alcohol. 
She died in 2004 and left behind a total of eight children, some of whom went to the same orphanage as the twins.

The documentary shows them meeting their three half siblings and speaking to another brother on the phone in Moscow.

'Ultimately, that story in the 
Ukraine is very similar to our story in America,' Greg told The East 
Hampton Press. 'When I’m speaking about our birth mother, I’m speaking 
about my adopted mother, too. I try to tell both of their stories.'

The film has already premiered at the 
East Hamptons movie theatre and is scheduled to be shown again at Jazz 
at Lincoln Center, of which Ammon had been a longtime supporter.
