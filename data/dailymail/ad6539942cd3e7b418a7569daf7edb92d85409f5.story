She was frustrated at how complicated her children's baby grows were to do up.

So, Melanie Chiknagi came up with an alternative - to create her own range of 'parent-friendly' suits.

The mother-of-two, a former commercial property surveyor from London, developed a new design of baby grow  that does not include traditional leg poppers, which she found  'difficult' to use.

Instead, her design, dubbed the Picklesuit, features plastic zips on each leg, with concealed flaps to protect the infant's limbs. It also includes wide arms and non-slip soles from size '6 months' up.

'Easy-to-use': While the suit (pictured) can be fully opened 'so that it is easy to dress little ones', its zips also allow parents to undress only their child's lower half during nappy changes, Mrs Chiknagi told DailyMail.com

While the suit can be fully opened 'so that it is easy to dress little ones', its zips also allow parents to undress only their child's lower half during nappy changes, Mrs Chiknagi told DailyMail.com.

'The design means that the baby's top half stays nice and warm,' she said. 'It's an innovative baby grow that is easy, practical, and hassle-free to put on, take off, and open for nappy changes.' 

And despite Mrs Chiknagi having launched her Picklesuit range only last year, it has already become a great success with British parents, with many deeming it an 'easy-to-use' and 'thoughtful' innovation.

The mother said she was first inspired to create the Picklesuit - which is now available in three star designs (red-and-white, grey and white) - after struggling to do up her baby son Samson's baby grow.

'Our second child was born and we still couldn't do up his baby grows,' said Mrs Chiknagi, who lives with her son, daughter, Matilda, and husband, Pascal, in an old Victorian house in the capital.

'Frustrated at the fiddly design on most, Pascal and I decided to design our own, parent-friendly one. We replaced leg poppers with a zip up each leg. Then we fitted a fabric flap inside the YKK zips.

Contrast: 'The design means that the baby's top half stays nice and warm,' she said. Left, a red-and-white star version of the Picklesuit with zips on the legs, compared to a normal baby grow with leg poppers, right

Son: The mother said she was first inspired to create the Picklesuit - now available in three star designs (red-and-white, grey and white) - after struggling to do up her baby son Samson's (pictured today) baby grow

'This ensures the zips never have any contact with baby's' legs and will not pinch the skin when done up.' She added: The Picklesuit took us a year to design, and getting this flap right was laborious.'

Another flap on the baby grow's front 'prevents the baby from playing with the zips, and means that when a parent is carrying their child, the zips won't dig into the carrier's skin', said Mrs Chignaki.

The Picklesuit, which is produced in a British factory that Mrs Chiknagi visits on an almost daily basis, was perfected after 'many, many prototypes', all of which the mother tried out on her two children.

'The result is the easiest, most straightforward babygrow to put on - even in the middle of the night, she said. 'Parenthood is hard enough without having to struggle with complicated clothes.

'We hope that the practical Picklesuit will help to make life just that little bit easier.'

Although she replaced leg zips with poppers, Mrs Chiknagi decided to keep poppers on her baby grow's front to enable parents to fully open it if they wish - or keep it shut during nappy changes. 

Mrs Chiknagi monitors her business, Picklebee, and customer's orders from her family home. She also creates other 'fun, practical' products for infants, including silicon bibs and reusable food pouches.

She recently exhibited her work to great acclaim at The Baby Show at ExCel London.

On her website, Mrs Chiknagi reveals she named her baby grow design the Picklesuit because she affectionately calls her children 'pickles'. For more information, visit: www.picklebeelimited.co.uk.
