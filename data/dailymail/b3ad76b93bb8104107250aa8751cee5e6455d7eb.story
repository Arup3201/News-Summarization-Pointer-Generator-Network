A California high school has ditched their controversial Arab mascot and his genie sidekick after complaints by anti-discrimination campaigners.

Coachella Valley High's mascot, who appears as a snarling man with a shaggy beard, hooked nose and head scarf, drew complaints from American-Arabs who felt it was derogatory.

School officials have now agreed to redesign the figure, and ditched his belly-dancing genie counterpart, although they insist the school will keep its 'Arabs' nickname for sports teams.

Coachella Valley High School has agreed to redesign its Arab mascot (pictured), and ditch his belly-dancing genie sidekick, after complaints from anti-discrimination campaigners

The Arab mascot has existed since the 1920s and is a nod to the desert region's reliance on date farming, a traditionally Middle Eastern crop.

Over the years, the mascot evolved from a turban-wearing horseman carrying a lance to a standing figure with a scowl and traditional head covering.

It came under fire last November when the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee sent a letter to the school district complaining that the mascot was stereotypical.

The district refused to change the school's 'Arabs' nickname, but it agreed to redesign the Arab face on the school logo.

The new design, which has been approved by the campaign group, depicts a stoic man with a neatly trimmed beard. 

The school has also dropped a belly-dancing genie (pictured) who often appeared at halftime shows

His face is partially covered in shadow and he's wearing a white headscarf emblazoned with the high school's initial, 'CV.'

Committee spokesman Abed Ayoub said: 'We passed it around to experts and community members. We took our time to get the opinion of that logo, and it was overwhelmingly positive.'

The school's current logo of the snarling mascot is still on the  welcome sign, the school website and a large mural on the campus gym.

A spokesman for the school district said officials will soon make a joint announcement with anti-discrimination group to discuss a final resolution to the mascot controversy.

'We hope that those witnessing our collaboration will follow our lead and keep their eyes, ears and hearts open to the feelings of others,' the statement said.
