By the time you read this, somewhere out there an out-of-control satellite may have already crashed to Earth.

Last night Nasa was preparing for its research craft to re-enter our atmosphere at 4.30am.

The six-ton satellite, which is the size of a bus, could hit any part of the globe – including Britain – hurling chunks of metal weighing up to 350lb across hundreds of miles.

As night fell yesterday it was orbiting 
the Earth, passing the UK every 90 minutes and visible in clear skies as
 a ‘bright light’.

Its 18,000 miles per hour descent was being tracked by RAF Fylingdales in Yorkshire.

Squadron Leader Ralph Dinsley said they would be updating the Space 
Operations Centre in High Wycombe throughout the night and the 
Government and emergency services were on standby if it appeared the UK 
was under threat.

The satellite’s final destination will be known just 
two hours before impact and even then Nasa will only be able to predict 
it to within the nearest 6,000 miles.

An estimated 26 pieces – weighing a total of 1,200lb – are expected to 
survive re-entry into the atmosphere.

Incredibly, the plummeting satellite has been caught on film.

Astrophotographer Thierry Legault's clip, shot in northern France, shows the 20-year-old Upper Atmosphere 
Research Satellite (UARS) - launched in 1991 to examine the ozone layer -
appearing as a beaming mass of light as it careers  to Earth.

Nasa orbital debris scientist Mark 
Matney admitted: ‘We know it is going to hit somewhere between 57 north 
and 57 south, which covers most of the inhabited world, unfortunately.’

However, scientists have ruled out the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite striking North America.

Its orbit was been altered by Nasa 
deliberately to make it crash – but it is now coming down sooner than 
expected due to changed atmospheric conditions.

It is falling to Earth at five miles 
per second, faster than previously thought and experts say there is a 
one in 3,200 chance of someone being hit by debris – more likely than 
getting a hole in one during a round of golf.

The 35ft Nasa craft, which weighs 
6.5 tons, was put into space in 1991 to monitor climate change, and 
ceased operations in 2005.

The falling satellite will look like a fiery meteor shower as it begins to burn up in the atmosphere.

It is expected to break into more 
than 100 pieces with most of it being destroyed before it hits the 
ground. But around 26 pieces are expected to make it through and the 
heaviest metal parts are expected to reach Earth, including titanium 
fuel tanks.

Nasa spokesman Steve Cole said: 
‘Anybody who finds a piece of the satellite should stay away from it and
 call the police and let them deal with it.

‘It could be very hot or it could be 
dangerous. It depends on what speed the debris is going, but it could go
 be going fast enough to go through a house.

‘We will have to wait and see if the 
debris creates a crater. If it is spherical that is possible but if it 
has a less regular shape it may not be going so fast.’

Mr Cole added that more accurate predictions are expected throughout today and will be posted on Nasa’s website.

Debris routinely falls to Earth from 
space but the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite will be the biggest 
Nasa craft to fall uncontrolled from space in 32 years.

In 1979 Skylab, which was 15 times 
bigger, rained charred chunks on the Indian Ocean and western Australia 
after Nasa said it would land in South Africa.

In 2003 when the space shuttle 
Columbia exploded upon re-entry killing its entire crew, large chunks of
 its shell landed across Texas.
