A mother who was left paralysed and unable to speak by a blood clot on her brain has learnt to walk and talk again - after copying her toddler daughter.

Sam Furniss, 35, was given the life changing news that she had two aneurysms when her daughter Ella was just 10 months old.

And her life hung in the balance when she suffered a massive bleed to the brain following an operation to remove them.

Doctors warned devastated husband Michael, 36, that even if she did survive, Sam could be left with terrible brain damage.

Though she survived, she was left unable to walk, talk or sit up.

But two years on she has stunned doctors with her recovery - learning to walk and talk alongside her daughter.

Sam, from Sheffield, said: 'I couldn't have recovered as well as I have without the support of Michael, and of course, Ella.

'I was so determined to get better to look after Ella - I wanted to run around with her in the park and be the best mum I could.

'I didn't want her to be running around while I was still stuck in my wheelchair - so it became a bit of a race to see which one of us would take our first steps.

She added: 'Ella beat me by a week - but once we'd both mastered taking one step, we progressed together, one step at a time.

'She's actually slightly better than me now - she can stand on one leg, which I'll never be able to do.

'Ella is such a caring little girl, and wise beyond her years - I was lucky to have such a wonderful medical and nursing team both in hospital and after I was discharged at home.'

Mother-of-one Sam was diagnosed with the aneurysm after suffering numbness in her right side while putting Ella to bed on New Year's Day 2010.

She thought that she had suffered a stroke but later found it was her nerves were being affected by the mass of blood vessels growing on her brain.

Although surgeons thought that surgery would solve the problem, they discovered that she had an extra bone in her skull that ruled out a successful operation.

She was eventually admitted for surgery after 10 months of tests and 17 brain scans she was admitted in October 2010.

Medics initially thought that the three-and-a-half hour operation had been a success.

But her condition began to deteriorate and a specialist spotted a blood clot on her brain while examining her several days later.

When the clot started to bleed she was rushed for more emergency surgery with doctors fearing she would die.

Sam said: 'The surgeons took Michael to one side and told him I was very, very ill, and I might not pull through the surgery.

'They told him that if I survived, the chances were that I'd be seriously brain damaged, and they didn't know to what extent I would recover.

'He was obviously devastated, and now it hurts me so much to think of the pain he must have gone through, which I was totally unaware of.

'When I came round after the surgery, I couldn't move. I wanted to speak, and sit up and get out of bed, but I couldn't move.

'I was terrified and frustrated - and I didn't know whether I would ever be able to walk or talk again.

'The nurses would come to me every day and hold up a pen and ask me if I knew what it was.

'In my head, I was screaming the word "pen", but it wouldn't come out of my mouth.

'I practised and practised while I was lying there by myself, and after two weeks, I was able to say it.

'It took a long time before I was able to speak coherently, and in long sentences, though.

'When Ella said her first word in March 2011, we were suddenly both trying to talk all the time, with our speech eventually getting more and more sophisticated at the same pace.

'She took her first step in May 2011, and I took mine two weeks later in June. However, it took months before I was able to walk long distances - and when we both got tired of walking, we both had a sit down in my wheelchair together.

Sam underwent tests in December and doctors say that her body has made an 85 per cent recovery.

She said: 'I sometimes get a bit tired if I've been on my feet all day, but Ella is always there to look after me. I don't know what I would have done without her.

'I have thrown myself into fundraising for my own charity, the Samira Furniss Charity Fund, and Headway, which helps support people who have suffered brain or head injuries.

'Two years ago, I didn't know if I'd ever be able to sit up and give my daughter a cuddle - I'm so happy we can run around and play together now.'
