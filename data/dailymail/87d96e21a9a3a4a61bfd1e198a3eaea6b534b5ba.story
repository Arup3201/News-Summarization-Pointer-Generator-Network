The owner of an Oklahoma restaurant has been accused of racism and bigotry for refusing to serve customers who are gay, from ethnic minorities, with disabilities, or without jobs.

Gary James didn't do much to dispel the allegation when he gave an interview to a local news station from his restaurant in Enid, called Gary's Chicaros.

'I’ve been in business 44 years, I think I can spot a freak or a f*****,' he told KFOR.

Former customer: Matt Gard says James would not allow him into Gary's Chicaros because he's in a wheelchair

Local man and former longtime customer Matt Gard says James has banned him from his restaurant because of his wheelchair.

James denies that the problem is Gard's disability.  'He created an issue. You only have one time here. You create an issue, you're out forever,' he told KFOR.

Gard claims that’s just 'a weak excuse,' and that James’ was denied entry because he is disabled and uses a wheelchair.

Gard, it must be noted, turned a blind eye to James' apparent discriminatory practices when he was basking in the restaurant owner's approval, but now says James' intolerance is unacceptable.

'He doesn’t like certain people of race, color, ethnicity,' Gard said of James.

James interview with KFOR's reporter, who is of Asian descent, seemed to confirm Gard's allegations.

When asked if he would refer to her using the racial slur 'chink,' James replied that he wouldn't.

Well, not unless 'we were drinking and joking around or something,' he said.

'If I reached over there and slapped the s*** out of you, you should be offended. But to call someone a "chink" or someone call me a bigot, that doesn’t bother me, why should it bother you?'

James proudly wears his restaurant's t-shirt, which spells out the small-town business-owner's creed.

The restaurant’s official t-shirt 
makes it clear that a 'faggot' isn’t welcome in James’s establishment. 
It also calls the place a n*****-free-zone, and threatens violence 
against Muslims, Democrats, and members of many minority groups.

'I really don’t want gays around. Any man that would compromise his own body would compromise anything,' James told KFOR.

After his latest press coverage, not even 'great whites' seem keen on patronizing Gary's Chicaros

He is also not willing to serve anyone on welfare, a circumstance many believe he himself may now end up in after his comments.

A Facebook page that sprung up in the wake of his interview designates Gary's Chicaros as a gay bar. It's been given 1.5 stars out of five by 885 reviewers, many of whom note instances of discrimination.

The restaurant's Yelp page is equally complimentary.

Enid, a city of almost 50,000 in Oklahoma with a largely white population, is a predominantly Republican stronghold. The population of Latino residents has doubled in recent years.

The word 'chicaros' seems an odd one for Gary James' restaurant and bar. The word sounds Spanish but has no apparent meaning.
