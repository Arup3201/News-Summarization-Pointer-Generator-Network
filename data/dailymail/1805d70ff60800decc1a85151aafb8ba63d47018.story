Some 850 people living in the city of New York are 'officially' over the age of 164, according to Board of Elections records that list all their birth dates as 1 January 1850.

Officials discovered that hundreds of residents were the implausible age when they were alerted to a quirk in the system left over from a 'bygone era'.

They explained that  previous practices allowed residents not to provide their exact birthdays when registering to vote - and 1 January 1850 is the default date for those whose birth dates were unknown or unclear.

Previous practices meant that residents in New York did not have to provide their exact birth date when registering to vote in the city - and this has led to some rather confusing ages being listed on official records

Some of the new voters, mostly women, simply wrote that they were '21+' - above the legal voting age -  when registering to vote, the New York Post reported.

'It's a left-over vestige from a bygone era,' Board of Elections executive director Mike Ryan told the newspaper.

'They were all listed as age 164. This was no accident. It's a little quirk in the system. It's not widespread,' he added, noting there are more than four million registered voters.

The bizarre discovery came after the Post reported on the case of 73-year-old Luz Pabellon who was listed on her official voter registration card as 'AGE: 164'.

850 residents were given birth dates that would mean they were alive in the days when Abraham Lincoln was president of the United States

Ms Pabellon, who lives in the Bronx, was in fact born on 14 February 1941.

'That's not me! I don't know why they did that!,' she told the newspaper, when alerted to her 'official' age.

'That's very strange. I've been voting for many years,' she added - just not in the 1800s.

Then this week, a search of the records in all five boroughs of New York found 849 more voters with the same implausible birth date as Ms Pabellon - meaning the city supposedly has a total of 850 voters who were alive when Abraham Lincoln was president.

The elections board explained that it switched to computerized databases in 1999 and 2006, and twice sent out notices imploring the 164-year-olds to provide their real birth dates.

But since most of them ignored the requests - and to comply with state rules election officials were required to write in a specific date of birth for all voters or remove them from the rolls - the birth date 1 January 1850 continued to be used.

New Yorkers who registered after 2006 were required to provide their true birth dates. 

As the rules now stand, a voter without a date of birth who shows up on Election Day will not be in the register, and will be declared ineligible to vote. 

But the fake birth dates have caused some concern about the potential for fraud.

'This is crazy. It's insane,' William Russell Moore, who challenged Bronx Assemblyman Marcos Crespo in the Democratic primary, told the Post. 

'The Board of Elections is very inept. How many people are they doing this to? This is the type of inattention that allows fraud to take place.'

At a meeting yesterday, Board of Election commissioners and Mr Ryan discussed ways to fix the issue, including sending out another letter requesting the real dates of birth and having staffers undertake the lengthy task of trying to contact the 850 by phone. 

Mr Ryan said the matter will be revisited after the November 4 election.
