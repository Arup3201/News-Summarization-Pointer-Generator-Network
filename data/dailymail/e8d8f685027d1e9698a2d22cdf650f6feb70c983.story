Promises: David Cameron is preparing new welfare policies to win back blue collar workers

David Cameron today promises a relentless focus on what matters ‘to the backbone of Britain – those who work hard and ‘do the right thing’.

The Prime Minister, who is seeking to use his party’s annual conference to revive Conservative fortunes, makes a direct pitch to the striving blue collar families that Margaret Thatcher won from Labour in the 1980s.

He ridicules Ed Miliband’s attempt last week to seize the traditional ‘one nation’ mantle from the Tories, saying the Labour leader’s vision sounded ‘more like East Germany than Great Britain’.

Mr Cameron dismisses senior Tory MPs calling for a sharp move to the Right, telling the Daily Mail that suggestions he is abandoning the centre ground of politics ‘could not be further from the truth’.

As he seeks to back ‘those who work hard and want to get on in life’, the Prime Minister is preparing new policies on welfare, the cost of living and the NHS. These include:

- A fresh crackdown on welfare, with housing benefit expected to be limited to the over-25s

- Measures to enable employees to take stakes in the firms they work for

- A revival of Mrs Thatcher’s flagship ‘right to buy’ policy for people living in council and social housing

- New Budget measures to help families with the cost of living

Mr Cameron is also reaffirming his commitment to protect the NHS budget from spending cuts, with £140million in funding to enable nurses and midwives to spend more time with patients instead of paperwork.

The Government is setting up a £15million cancer radiotherapy innovation fund and a guarantee that from April next year all cancer patients will have access to the most innovative radiotherapy where clinically appropriate, safe and cost-effective.

The Prime Minister is also seeking to 
address a slide in support for the Conservatives among a key group of 
voters dubbed ‘suspicious strivers’ – around 15 per cent of the 
population who are not sure that their efforts will bring them the right
rewards.

Pledge: Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured meeting staff at Royal Salford Hospital in Manchester, has vowed to protect the NHS budged and improve care services

He launched a strong attack on Mr Miliband, accusing him of ‘endless attacks on wealth but nothing about creating it, endless attacks on the British economy but nothing on dealing with the debt, nothing about how we’re going to compete in the world either’.

The Liberal Democrats will be shown ‘no mercy’ at the next general election, Grant Shapps said yesterday.

The Tory party chairman said he was gunning for ten Liberal Democrats on a hit-list of 40 priority seats the Tories aim to seize at the next election.

Asked if those included MPs in Nick Clegg’s party, Mr Shapps replied: ‘Abso-bloody-lutely, yes.’ His comments scotch speculation of a non-aggression pact between the Coalition parties at the May 2015 election.

Civil servants are facing a crackdown on trade union duties and activities undertaken during work hours.

Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude will announce restrictions following evidence that taxpayers are funding the salaries of trade union activists in the civil service to the tune of £36million a year.

At least 6,800 civil servants are being paid from public funds to cover working hours on union duties. Ministers complain much of the officials’ time has been spent fighting the drive to cut costs at Whitehall.

Hundreds who work full-time on union business are being paid from public funds.

At the Tory party conference, Mr Maude will announce a cap preventing officials from spending more than half their paid time on union work.

He will also ban them from taking time off to attend union conferences. Last year, 5,781 paid days off were given to civil servants to attend the events.
