An intoxicated man was found passed out in his car at a McDonald's drive-thru after being asked by staff to pull over and wait for his food order

An 'intoxicated' man was found passed out in his car at a McDonald's drive-thru after being asked by staff to pull over and wait for his food order.

McDonald's staff discovered the young man passed out in the car with a bottle of liquor on his lap. 

Police were called to the fast food franchise in Coolalinga, Darwin, Northern Territory around 2am on Saturday.

A police spokeswoman said the 25-year-old man cruised through the Macca's drive-through at 1:30am.

After the man ordered his food he was asked to pull over in the waiting area, located slightly off to the side from the drive-thru..

Half an hour later staff went to deliver his food and found the man passed out in his car, allegedly from alcohol intoxication.

Police arrived at the scene and arrested the 'drunken' man. He was then taken to the watch-house.

His license was confiscated by police and he now faces charges including failing to provide a sample of breathe, driving an unregistered car and driving without insurance.

The man is expected to appear in Darwin court on November 4.
