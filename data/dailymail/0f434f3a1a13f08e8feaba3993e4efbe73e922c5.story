The Fragrance Shop sells 100,000 bottles in first two hours

They've conquered the music charts. And now JLS are proving their pulling power in the world of perfumery as more than 100,000 bottles of their debut scent were snapped up after it launched this morning.

Even before the perfume went on sale today, 15,000 female fans, eager to get a whiff of the perfume 'Kiss', had their names added to a waiting list.

After conquering the music charts JLS are taking on the perfume industry with the launch of their debut fragrance 'Kiss'

To get the perfect fragrance Aston Merrygold, Marvin Humes, Jonathan ‘JB’ Gill and Oritse Williams worked with perfume designer Azzi Glasser.

She has previously designed ranges for Kylie, Nicole Farhi, Topman and Agent Provocateur.

JLS' debut fragrance Kiss is proving a hit with the ladies

A spokesperson from The Fragrance Shop, where the scent is being sold, described how each band member had contributed to the process.

'Aston loved the cheeky cassis note.

'Oritsé added the sensual black orchid as it is his favourite flower.

'Marvin adores Tuberose, and JB wanted the hypnotic scent of amber crystals lingering on the skin.'

The scent, priced at £13.50 for 30ml, is contained in a white bottle, complete with magnetic lid and each box comes signed with a kiss.

In a previous message, the boys told fans:

'We are very excited to announce that JLS will be launching a new female fragrance! more info will be coming soon! JLSHQ x.'

JLS follow a number of other music stars and celebrities with their own perfume range, including Nicki Minaj, Britney Spears, Justin Bieber and Katy Perry.

They have recently been in Las Vegas celebrating Marvin Humes' stag party ahead of his marriage to The Saturdays' Rochelle Wiseman later this year.
