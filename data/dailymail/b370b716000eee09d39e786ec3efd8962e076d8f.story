The choice of a Pope from Latin America is a powerful symbol of the shift of influence in Roman Catholicism from the old to the new world.

Jorge Mario Bergoglio is the third Pontiff in a row who is not from Italy and the first in more than a millennium from outside Europe.

His election to the Papacy signals the importance of the burgeoning strength of the church in Latin America and in Africa, now home to a growing proportion of the world’s 1.2 billion Catholics.

The election of the first Jesuit to the Papacy also represents the triumph of the order founded nearly 500 years ago, which has for centuries concentrated on mission around the globe, and particularly in the Americas.

It also points to the rising economic influence of Latin America where Brazil has joined the list of booming nations with fast-rising levels of wealth. Although Argentina lags behind in economic terms, the election of the new Pope Francis says that Latin America is no longer a sideshow in terms of world power.

The election was greeted with joy in Buenos Aires where the shifting centre of gravity was taken as an occasion of deep national pride.

Cardinal Bergoglio has European links to satisfy conservatives who would worry about the risks of too great a break with tradition. The child of Italian immigrants, from a country with deep Italian connections, he has a cultural background that will be familiar and comfortable for many in the Curia.

Many will regard the choice of the new Pope as a compromise between the safety-first option of an Italian or European candidate and the radical departure that picking a Pontiff from the rising churches of Africa would have represented.

A number of cardinals from the developing world, including Ghanaian Peter Turkson, had been mentioned as candidates.

Cardinal Turkson fired the first shot in the battle to succeed Benedict XVI when he said ‘young churches’ of Africa and Asia were ready to provide worldwide leadership for Roman Catholicism.
