As they watched a giant beast lurching through the water in outer Siberia, experts thought they had found evidence that the extinct woolly mammoth was alive and well.

But the dramatic footage is a hoax the documentary maker who made the recording has revealed.

Lou Petho filmed the video himself - minus the woolly mammoth - and said someone had doctored his footage.

Woolly Mammoth? A still from the video that purportedly shows a prehistoric elephant crossing a river in Siberia, Russia. The footage is a hoax

Hoax: The original footage, filmed by Lou Petho, shows the lake without the non-existent woolly mammoth

Divided opinion: Believers said they can see reddish-brown 'wool' or fur and clear white tusks. In reality, it was computer-generated

Inconclusive: The footage, reportedly taken by a government worker who was out surveying planned roadworks, is too grainy for anyone to get a good look at the creature

It was claimed the clip was caught by a government engineer in Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, Siberia.

The video appeared to show an elephant-shaped animal with reddish-brown fur - which
would match the colour of mammoth hair dug up from the perma-frost in 
frozen Russia - and a trunk dragging in the river.

In reality the animal was nothing 
more than a computer creation and the footage was recorded as part of a 
documentary and captured by Mr Petho during a five-day trek.

Leo Petho said in a video he 
published on YouTube: 'I was alerted to the fact that a character by the
name of Michael Cohen took hold of some of my footage without knowing 
it and created an elaborate hoax on the public.'

He
added: 'They took this video and, through CGI I imagine, created a 
woolly mammoth crossing a river. I did not give them permission to do 
this.'

He accused them of 'staling' people's footage and 'creating a lie with it' and profiting from it.

Suspicious trunk: The mammoth's distinctive trunk seems to straighten out in some stills and hang lank in others - because a poor job had been done of the hoax

It looks a litle something like this: A replica of a woolly mammoth on display at the Royal British Columbia Museum in Victoria, British Columbia. Woolly mammoths roamed North America, Europe, and Asia

Paranormal writer Michael Cohen, 41, said at the time: 'It is highly possible that a number of species, 
extinct elsewhere, survive in the area.'

And he explained that the discovery of extinct animals still alive in Siberia would not be music to the ears of the Russian government.

He added: 'If surviving woolly mammoths were found in Siberia, it could run against 
Russia's plans to further develop and exploit the area's considerable 
resources.'

There is evidence of the woolly mammoth living up to 150,000 years ago across northern North America and Eurasia, with the best preserved carcasses in Siberia.

But the species had disappeared at the end of the Pleistocene era (10,000 years ago), with an isolated population still living on Siberian Wrangel Island until around 1,700BC.
