The last leg of the fastest road in America opened on Wednesday where the speed limit is 85mph.

The final 41-mile stretch of Texas Highway 130 was finally finished after three years of construction.

The toll road is intended to alleviate the crowded Interstate 35 corridor between Austin and San Antonio, which are two of the state's largest metropolitan areas.

Controversial: The 85 mph speed limit has been approved for a 41-mile-long toll road near the increasingly crowded Interstate 35 corridor between Austin and San Antonio

The new stretch will be from 
Mustang Ridge, ten miles south of Austin's international airport, 
to Interstate 10, just east of Seguin. A 50-mile stretch bypassing 
Austin is already open.

Tolls
for cars displaying an electronic toll tag will be about 
15 cents per mile. But no tolls will be collected until November 11.

The new stretch of high-speed road has prompted fears that fatalities could increase.

'The research is clear that when speed limits go up, fatalities go up,' said Russ Rader, a spokesman for the nonprofit Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.

Higher speed limits get people to their destinations faster, Rader said, 'but the trade-off is more crashes and more highway deaths.'

A 2009 report in the American Journal of Public Health studied traffic fatalities in the U.S. from 1995 to 2005 and found that more than 12,500 deaths were attributable to increases in speed limits on all kinds of roads.

The study also said that rural 
highways showed a 9.1 per cent increase in fatalities on roads where 
speed limits were raised, but did not cite specific numbers in those 
instances.

There are no longer any roads in the 
U.S. with no speed limit like Germany's autobahn with most top speeds being 75mph. Some highways in rural
West Texas and Utah have 80 mph speed limits.

The
Texas Legislature last year approved 85 mph limits for some new 
stretches of road.Â  The
Texas Transportation Commission, which is appointed by Gov. Rick Perry,
approved the 85 mph speed limit at a public meeting on August 30. A 
transportation department spokesman said commissioners would not comment
on their decision.

Agency officials had previously said they would study the toll road's topography, the speeds that most drivers were reaching, and the safety of access points and cross sections before approving the 85 mph speed limit.

'Safety is our top priority and tests have shown the designated speed is a safe one,' agency spokeswoman Veronica Beyer said.

Alan Guckian, who lives in Austin and regularly drives to Seguin to visit family, said he'll likely use the road for convenience and the pleasure of driving fast.

'I would love it,' Guckian said. 'Sometimes it's fun to just open it up.'

Steve Marcy sometimes uses another part of the toll road on his daily commute from Round Rock, north of Austin, to his job in San Antonio. The section he drives now has an 80 mph speed limit.

Marcy said he'd be comfortable driving 85, but would be concerned about others driving vehicles that are not in good condition.

'A tire blowout (at 85 mph) could be a big hazard,' Marcy said.

Chris Lippincott, spokesman for SH 130 Concession Co. that is building the road, said the company is committed to operating a safe highway.

'On any road, drivers hold the key to safety based on traffic, travel conditions and the capabilities of their own vehicles,' Lippincott said.

Toll prices have not yet been set for the new section. Marcy predicted the higher speed limit will attract new drivers, but said most won't think it's worth the cost of the tolls.

'For most people I talk to, it's a cost issue,' Marcy said.
