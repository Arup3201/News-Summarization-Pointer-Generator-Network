A group of 37 MPs have put their names to a report which says packaging should remain on cigarettes to help struggling small businesses

Plans to sell cigarettes in plain packaging should be dropped, a group of influential Tory MPs demand today.

The Free Enterprise group of backbenchers, which includes many rising stars from the new intake, today calls for the plans to be abandoned in order to prevent small shops being hit by a fall in tobacco sales or a rise in tobacco smuggling.

Some 37 MPs have put their names to a report published today on ways to promote ‘the growth of Britain’s small businesses’ which demands a cull of damaging regulations.

The report calls on ministers to ‘drop proposals for plan packaging tobacco products’.

The Prime Minister appeared to kill off plans to impose plain packaging in July, saying further evidence was needed to show whether it would be effective.

But in a surprise move, public health minister Jane Ellison announced last week that paediatrician Sir Cyril Chantler will carry out a rapid review of the evidence by March - meaning plain packs could be brought in by the time of the 2015 election.

The review was ordered in response to evidence emerging from Australia, which last year became the first country to introduce plain packaging.

The change of heart was welcomed by health campaigners, but tobacco companies said a ban lead to an increase in smuggling and counterfeit products.

The Free Enterprise Group of MPs warned that introducing plain packs is unnecessary regulation that will hurt small businesses.

Those who have signed the paper include the chairman of the Treasury select committee Andrew Tyrie, David Cameron’s envoy to the Indian community Prit Patel and leading backbenchers like Jesse Norman, Nadhim Zahawi, Andrea Leadsom and Margot James.

David Cameron appeared to rule out the possibility of plain packets last July but a recent U-turn means they could be on shelves by the next election in 2015

One of the MPs involved told the Mail: ‘This is a an unnecessary burden for business. Lots of businesses sell tobacco. It could be a problem for small businesses.’ Their report was written before the government u-turn but Kwasi Kwarteng, who coordinates the activities of the group, said it would be published unchanged today.

He called on the Chantler review to consider the risks to business, as well as those of public health.

Kwasi Kwarteng MP, said: ‘I look forward to seeing Sir Cyril Chantler’s conclusions and would also hope that the potential consequences for businesses feature in the government’s decision making.

‘This is a complex and technical area of policy and the government is absolutely right to take the time to consider all the available evidence rather than to rush towards legislating as the Labour opposition is demanding.’
