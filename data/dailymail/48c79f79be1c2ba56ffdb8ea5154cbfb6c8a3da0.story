Ed Miliband’s attempts to appear tough on ‘fat cat’ pay in the City were last night undermined by the revelation that his new multi-millionaire backer based his companies in an infamous Caribbean tax haven.

Tycoon Andrew Rosenfeld, who has made an estimated £100 million from property investments, registered his international network of businesses in the British Virgin Islands – using a trust company that boasts that it ‘makes full use of  the legal and tax advantages offered by different jurisdictions’.

Mr Rosenfeld was appointed by the 
Labour leader last year to mastermind the party’s General Election 
strategy, shortly after the businessman made a £1 million donation to 
Labour.

Since becoming party leader, Mr Miliband has attacked capitalist ‘predators’ and called for a crackdown on tax avoidance.

Mr Rosenfeld, 49, became a tax exile in 2006 when he moved to Geneva and established his Air Capital property empire, registered in the BVI.

By remaining in Switzerland  for five complete tax years – he returned to the UK last April –  Mr Rosenfeld was able to remain exempt from Capital Gains Tax on his property and investments.

Last night, a spokesman for Mr Rosenfeld insisted he was now paying tax in the UK.
