This is the moment a 23-year-old thug threw his defenceless puppy around his back garden, trapping the dog's head in the a door and repeatedly kicked him because he wouldn't go inside.

Liam Backhouse was seen by a neighbour hurling the two-month-old Staffordshire bull terrier against a concrete step with such force that the tiny animal 'bounced' off the hard surface.

Backhouse, from Barrow in Cumbria, was behind bars today and was banned from owning a pet for seven years after he admitted causing unnecessary suffering to an animal at Furness Magistrates' Court.

Brutal: Liam Backhouse was seen by a neighbour hurling the two-month-old Staffordshire bull terrier against a concrete step with such force that the tiny animal 'bounced' off the hard surface

Thug: Liam Backhouse was filmed by a neighbour throwing his defenceless puppy around his back garden in Barrow, Cumbria because it wouldn't go inside

The court was shown a video, taken by Backhouse’s neighbour on November 19, which showed him throwing the puppy around the garden of his home, trapping his head in the back door and repeatedly kicking him.

The neighbour had heard the dog yelping
 in distress at around 10.35am and began to film the incident before 
calling the police.

Steve Marsh, prosecuting on behalf of 
the RSPCA, said: 'During one incident he called the puppy three or four 
times to come inside but the dog wouldn’t move.

'He walked over, picked it up and threw it through the air towards the door.

'He tempted the puppy inside and then shouted at it for being there.'

Shock: The video, showing Backhouse repeatedly kicking the dog, was shown to Furness Magistrates' Court

Aftermath: Following the attack, which lasted almost an hour, the puppy - originally named Titan but now called Dudley - was left badly shaken and bruised

Mr
 Marsh told the court how Backhouse had thrown the puppy at a concrete 
step with such force the animal was seen to bounce off it. He also poured a 
bottle of water over the dog, causing the animal to run away.

Following the attack, which lasted 
almost an hour, the puppy - originally named Titan but now called Dudley
 - was left badly shaken and bruised.

He was rushed to see a vet but fortunately recovered from the incident and is now being adopted by an RSPCA inspector.

Backhouse, who appeared in court in a 
grey Nike tracksuit, sat with his head bowed throughout proceedings. 
When the DVD showing the attack was shown to the court he could be seen 
to wipe his eyes.

Karen Templeton, mitigating, told the court Backhouse had been depressed and became angry when after he spent the morning playing with the puppy it defecated on the carpet, and he stepped in the mess.

'He offers no excuses for what’s happened, he is clearly upset,' Miss Templeton said.

'He said "I seriously hate myself for what I have done". He suffers from severe depression.'

Sentenced: District judge Gerald Chalk, sitting at Furness Magistrates' Court, jailed Backhouse for 80 days, and banned him from owning a pet for seven years

District judge Gerald Chalk jailed Backhouse for 80 days, and banned him from owning a pet for seven years.

He also ordered that the Staffordshire bull terrier and a snake owned by Backhouse be seized.

Passing sentence, told Backhouse: 'The choice to keep a pet is a matter that is entirely voluntary but, once you choose, there are obligations towards the animal and they are obvious when it’s a very young animal.

'This is a small puppy that was defenceless. You have shown total disrespect for this animal and have terrorised it.'
