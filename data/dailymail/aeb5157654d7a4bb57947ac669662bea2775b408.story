Leeds Rhinos star Kevin Sinfield was presented with his MBE by the Duke of Cambridge on Wednesday at an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace. 

Sinfield, who had taken Leeds to six Grand Final wins in the past 10 years and  three World Club Challenge victories, paid tribute to his club after receiving the honour. 

'I would like to accept it on behalf of the club really,' said the 34-year-old. 'So many people played a part in the success, over the last 10 years in particular.

'For me to get recognised is very humbling but like I said I think it represents the club, all the players, our staff and the fans - it’s been a great place to work and play for the last ten years.'

Sinfield celebrate a momentous Challenge Cup triumph in the summer claiming a final win over Castleford after six previous defeats for the club since 2000.  

'We’ve had a fair few shots at it and I’ve lost in five finals so there was certainly a little bit of baggage there, but to finally get over the line in August was incredible.'

Sinfield revealed Prince William's interest in rugby league, saying the royal sent a letter to the England team before their nail-biting World Cup semi-final defeat to New Zealand last year. 

'I knew he had a keen interest in the England rugby league team, he sent the team a letter before the semi-final and he knew about the Challenge Cup - he’s not forgotten about us up in Leeds,' Sinfield said. 

Also honoured was British motorsport legend Dario Franchitti, the four-time IndyCar series champion who retired from the sport after suffering serious injuries in a crash last year in the United States.

Scotland's Franchitti, who is still involved with the Ganassi team he drove for, said: 'It's a wonderful tribute, it's a wonderful thing to have happen.

'I'm very proud of the honour obviously and it's a wonderful full stop to my driving life, it's wonderful to be recognised,' he added. 

The sports stars were honoured alongside Homeland and Band of Brothers actor Damien Lewis.
