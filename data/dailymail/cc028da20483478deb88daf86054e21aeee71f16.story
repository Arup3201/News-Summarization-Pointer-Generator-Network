Transport Secretary Justine Greening is considering whether a £500 million tunnel should be bored to minimise impact on the landscape

Ministers are considering drilling a tunnel costing up to £500million under the Chilterns as senior Tories rebel against the new high speed rail link.

Transport Secretary Justine Greening will confirm this week that she is delaying the decision over the HS2 route between London and Birmingham until the New Year.

The 1.5-mile tunnel would be in the constituency of Welsh Secretary Cheryl Gillan.

She is deeply opposed to the rail link and has indicated she may quit the Cabinet if the route ploughs through her Chesham and Amersham constituency.

Other senior Tories opposed to the proposed route include Europe minister David Lidington and Government whip Jeremy Wright. Speaker John Bercow is also reported to oppose it.

The 100-mile rail link, which would be built between 2016 and 2026, aims to cut the London to Birmingham journey time to 49 minutes from the current typical time of 1 hr 23 min.

Ministers argue that the improvement will boost the economy of the West Midlands, the North West and Yorkshire.

The cost of the extra tunnel has been
reported to be around £500million, although sources say it will be 
‘significantly’ less and would be funded by savings made elsewhere on 
the route.

It would join up two other tunnels around Amersham, reducing the impact 
on the Chilterns, a designated area of outstanding natural beauty.

The Campaign to Protect  Rural England said additional tunnelling would 
be ‘essential’  if HS2 is to be built through the Chilterns.

But a spokesman added: ‘We are concerned by suggestions that the 
additional £500million will come from cutting back on mitigation 
measures elsewhere.

'Just because countryside is not nationally 
designated does not mean it should not be valued and protected.

Labour has put forward an alternative route which would see HS2 using 
more existing transport ‘corridors’.

Transport spokesman Maria Eagle 
said: ‘By stubbornly refusing to consider Labour’s alternative plan for 
HS2, half a billion pounds of taxpayers’ money is set to be spent on 
mitigating the environmental impacts of a flawed route.’

Meanwhile, a report commissioned by 17 councils affected by the route 
has accused ministers of making a ‘deeply flawed and very weak’ economic
case for the project.

It says benefits to the taxpayer could be as little as half the £32billion costs.
