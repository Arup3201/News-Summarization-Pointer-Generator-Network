Samsung's latest handset could mean the end of having to scroll through webpages - as the phone can 'watch' users to see where they are looking.

The handset, to be unveiled in New York on 14th March, is also believed to have a five-inch screen and a 13 megapixel camera as Samsung bids to jump ahead of Apple's iPhone 5.

It is believed the 'eye tracking' system will allow users to automatically scroll through a news story, for example, as the handset knows when they have reached the bottom of the page.

Samsung's Galaxy S IV is rumoured to have eye tracking capabilities as well as a 13MP camera, according to the latest leaks online

A camera on the front of the handset is able to focus on the user's eye.

It can then calculate where on the screen they are looking - and automatically advance pages when they reach the bottom, for instance.

'The phone will track a userâ€™s eyes to determine where to scroll', a 
Samsung employee told the New York Times.

In January Samsung filed for a trademark in Europe for the name 'Eye Scroll', which is believed to refer to the new feature.

It also filed for the 'Samsung Eye Scroll' trademark in the United States in February, describing the service as 'Computer application software having a feature of sensing eye movements and scrolling displays of mobile devices, namely, mobile phones, smartphones and tablet computers according to eye movements; digital cameras; mobile telephones; smartphones; tablet computers.'

The rumours come amid increasing speculation over the handset ahead of its unveiling on March 14th in New York.

It is believed the new handset could have a five-inch screen and boast a 13MP camera as Samsung tries to leap ahead of Apple in the smartphone wars.

The leaked images of the Galaxy IV from @evleaks also show that it will come in 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB versions with 2GB of RAM.

The Samsung Galaxy S IV is set to be revealed in New York on March 14th, and is believed to be one of the largest phones on the market with a five inch screen

Samsung Electronics' mobile division 
chief JK Shin told South Korea's Edaily news website that the decision 
to launch the new smartphone in the U.S. was spurred by demand from 
mobile networks.

'We introduced the Galaxy S III in London last year, and this time we 
changed the venue (to New York)... as we were bombarded with requests 
from U.S. mobile carriers to unveil the Galaxy S IV in the country,' he 
said.

Samsung unveiled its first Galaxy S during the CTIA mobile trade show in
the U.S. in 2010, followed by the Galaxy SII at the MWC fair in Spain 
in 2011 and the Galaxy SIII in London last year.
