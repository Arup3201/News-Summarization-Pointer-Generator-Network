A Boxing Day 'weather bomb' is set to batter Britain bringing rain and winds to much of the UK,as people traditionally set off to see family and friends on the day after Christmas.

Forecasters said there is still a lot of uncertainty about the weather for the festive period, with hopes of a white Christmas dashed for much of the country. 

The UK is likely to see a crisp, cold but dry Christmas morning and a frosty start to Boxing Day before rain and wind arrives in the afternoon as a strong weather front sweeps across from the west to east of the country.

Strong winds and rain were seen on the coast of Cleveleys, Lancashire, as forecasters warned of a Boxing Day weather bomb on the way 

An area of low pressure, coming in from across the Atlantic, is expected to sweep across western and eastern Britain bringing heavy rain 

Temperatures are expected to dip below freezing and heavy downpours could case travel problems, particularly in the north which has already been drenched by rain this week.

Met Office forecasters said they expect a 'rapid cyclogenesis' - or weather bomb - on Boxing Day, defined as a rapid drop in pressure over a 24 hour period.

Leon Brown, forecaster for The Weather Channel UK, said the falling pressure is likely to create unsettled conditions for December 26.

He said: 'We will see some explosive cyclogenesis in the North Atlantic and a rapidly deepening area of low pressure approaching north Scotland.

'Pressure actually falling by nearly 50mb from Friday to Saturday so we can call the system the Boxing Day Bomb.' 

Met Office forecasters said it was too early to calculate the actual expected dip in pressure, but confirmed they did expect it to decrease over Boxing Day. 

A 'weather bomb', or cyclogenesis, is defined as an incident when the air pressure drops by 24millibars in 24 hours. Parts of Britain were battered by wind and rain when a similar 'weather bomb' hit earlier this month, 

'There will be a spell of wet and windy weather for most of the UK on Boxing Day,' said Helen Roberts, a forecaster at the Met Office. 

Christmas Eve and Christmas Day are likely to be bright and crisp, according to forecasters, before rain hits the country on Boxing Day

'Generally there will be a bright cold start in most areas before an area of low pressure, which could be more prominent than we are used to, is expected to move across the north part of the UK.' 

The low pressure will come in from the Atlantic, bringing wind and rain to the West on Friday afternoon and overnight and into Saturday morning for much of the East. 

And while the low pressure will bring a cold start to Christmas and Boxing Day mornings, the mercury is expected to dip further next week when it is likely to plunge to -6C for New Year's Eve.  

Warnings for rain have been issued for North England, Northern Ireland, North Wales and Scotland today after the north of the country was drenched by downpours in the last 24 hours. 

The warnings come as roads were twice as busy this lunchtime as the Christmas getaway began. 

There were 1238 miles of tailbacks on the roads, with 2265 congestion hotspots causing 154 hours of delays. The normal jam length at 1pm on a Tuesday at this time of year is 544 miles – so the roads were twice as busy as usual.

In the Greater London area alone, the number of traffic hotspots was 690, whilst in Birmingham and surrounding areas there were 199 separate congestion hotspots. In Greater Manchester, however, there were just 32 hotspots.

The nation was hit by strong winds and flash floods on Monday, with planes buffeted from side to side at Leeds Bradford Airport. Customers at an ASDA supermarket in Scotland had to be rescued after they became stranded by rising flood waters when the River Irvine burst its banks. Dozens of trains had to be cancelled, with severe disruptions to train services between Glasgow Central and Newcastle via Carlisle. 

In Lancashire heavy winds have been hammering the coast today, as Mimi the dog was blown along the path where more rain is forecast

Up to three inches of rain are forecast to fall in areas of the north of the UK today as temperatures are set to plummet on Christmas Day

Yellow weather warnings have been issued as up to two inches (50mm) of rain is expected to fall today, with up to three inches (80mm) expected in areas of Cumbria and the Pennines. 

Christmas Eve is expected to be a much drier but colder day, with crisp sunshine in the South East. In Scotland and parts of Northern Ireland there are likely to be showers, which could turn thundery as the day goes on. 

The mercury is expected to reach around 8C in the south and 4C in the north. 

Temperatures are expected to plummet to 2C or just below freezing over night, making for a cold and crisp Christmas morning. 

Ms Roberts added: 'It will be really quite a cold day with widespread frost, and temperatures could drop to -6C in the North overnight. 

'There will be a decent start to Boxing Day. Most people won't start to see rain and strong winds until the afternoon, and in Eastern areas not until after dark. There is likely to be a lot of heavy and persistent rain.

'It is being caused by a low pressure system coming in from the Atlantic. Cyclogenesis will happen over the Atlantic and this will spread to the UK. The jetstream directs this low pressure over the country.'

Downpours are expected to spread across the width of the country, starting in the West on Friday afternoon and well into the evening. 

However forecasters said the rain is unlikely to be as heavy or as persistent as last year, when dozens of trains were cancelled and swathes of the Somerset Levels were plunged under water for months. 

By Saturday the low pressure will move across the East of the country and it is set to be windy for most of the day. By Sunday the drier and brighter weather is expected to return

Bookmakers are offering odds of 12/1 against snow on Christmas Day in London, while the Met Office says the most that can be expected is 'sleety snow on higher ground', which is unlikely to settle. Some higher areas of Scotland and the north of England may see a light dusting of snow on Christmas morning as temperatures fall. 

Ladbrokes has lengthened the odds of a White Christmas in London to 12/1, with odds of 8/1 in Birmingham, 6/1 in Manchester and 3/1 in Glasgow. 

A spokesman for the bookmaker said: 'At this stage there's more chance of Santa Claus coming down the chimney than the UK waking up to a blanket of white snow on Christmas Day.'

It has not snowed on Christmas Day in Britain since 2010, with extreme cold more often seen in January and February.
