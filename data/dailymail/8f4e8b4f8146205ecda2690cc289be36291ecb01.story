Crystal Palace have made an opening offer of around £6million for Swansea striker Bafetimbi Gomis.

The move comes after Swansea agreed a loan deal for Benfica striker Nelson Oliveira.

However, Swansea want Oliveira as cover for Wilfried Bony who is joining up with Ivory Coast for the Africa Cup of Nations next month. They only signed Gomis on a free transfer in the summer and are in no rush to sell.

France international Gomis is understood to have a release clause figure of £7million in his contract but that does not kick in until the summer.

Palace manager Neil Warnock wants a striker and a left-back as priorities for his squad with an offer on the table for Lille's Senegal international Pape Souare.

Gomis has interest from other Premier League sides but Palace are the first to make an offer.

Manager Garry Monk said: 'The links and speculation I can't stop, but Bafe's [Gomis] a Swansea City player.'

Gomis, 29, joined Swansea for free on a four-year deal in June 2014.

Monk says Gomis is a different type of striker to Oliveira and the signing will give him more attacking options.

'I've really enjoyed working with Bafe [Gomis],' said Monk.

'He's a great professional, a good guy and a top, top, player.

'Obviously trying to give him game time has been difficult this season with Wilfried Bony doing so well in that lone striker role.

'It can be frustrating for players, but Bafe's been brilliant. He's not shown that at all in training and he's worked extremely hard.

'I'll be looking to play Bafe very much in this coming period and for him to be wearing that shirt, then it's his to lose.'
