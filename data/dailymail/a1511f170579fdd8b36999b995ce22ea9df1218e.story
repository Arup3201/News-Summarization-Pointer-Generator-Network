The families of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran have begged for their lives to be spared in their first interview on Indonesian television as it emerged Tony Abbott called the Indonesian president to ask for clemency.

The lengthy interview, which was recorded in English and shown on Metro TV on Wednesday night, was cut down to just 45 seconds as the families spoke of the men's rehabilitation and pleaded for clemency from President Joko Widodo.

'I don't want them to execute my son. He has done a lot of good things, he is a good person, he is a changed person,' Sukumaran's mother, Raji, said.

'I am begging the president not to execute him, to give him another chance, for him to stay in the prison and continue to do all the good things he is doing.' 

It comes as Toby Abbott called the Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Wednesday night and described the conversation over the fate of the two Australians on death row as positive.

'Suffice it to say that the president absolutely understands our position,' Mr Abbott said. 

Ms Sukumaran was joined in the interview by her two children, Chinthu and Brintha, as well as Chan's brother Michael. 

'We feel embarrassed because this happened. We, as a family, know that this has caused a lot of shame for Indonesians and we apologise,'  Michael Chan, wearing a traditional Indonesian batik shirt, said.

'But I think (in) 10 years he had done a lot of good things for Indonesians inside the prison system to try and ask for forgiveness.'

The short excerpt was recorded in English and wasn't captioned, which would have made it difficult for many Indonesians to understand, Fairfax Media reports.

The exclusive interview, which was their first for Indonesian television, was wrapped into a news bulletin on the impending executions.

Using just 45 seconds of interview footage highlighted how Sukumaran and Chan's positive rehabilitation in jail may not be known to Indonesia's population.   

News bulletins are regularly filled with drug warnings  and details of Sukumaran and Chan's arrest for trying to smuggle heroin from Bali to Australia is barely reported, according to Fairfax Media.

Indonesia's attorney-general  said on Wednesday that 10 drug traffickers, including Chan and Sukumaran, were slated to be executed soon.

No date has been set, but authorities said preparations were 90 percent ready.

Sukumaran's parents, Raji and Sam, and his siblings Chinthu and Brintha, have been in Bali for the past month.

They have been unable to sleep or eat properly as they continue to live on knife's edge, News Corp reports. 

Chan's parents, Helen and Ken, have also spent the past three weeks in Bali  but were forced to return to Australia due to poor health. 

His brother Michael remains in Bali with friends.

Mr Abbott said of his conversation on Wednesday he thought President Widodo was carefully considering Indonesia's position. 

'I don't think it would help the case of these two young Australians if I was to start ventilating in public the contents of the conversation,' he told reporters in Canberra on Thursday.

The president previously rejected clemency for convicted drug runners Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran.

It comes as lawyers for the Bali Nine duo lodged an appeal after they lost a bid to challenge Indonesia's presidential decree to spare the men from execution on Tuesday. 

Their lawyers  now have 14 days to lodge an appeal, according to one of their lawyers Peter Morrissey.

'(Indonesia) have a court system, they have a rule of law and when you have the rule of law it stands to reason that you just don't execute the people who are litigating,' Mr Morrissey said.

'So what we think will happen is that the Indonesian executive will likely cooperate with the rule of law and act in accordance with it and not do anything drastic unless all legal impediments really are removed. And right now there is a live appeal on foot.

'We are very hopeful about it, you know. We are not going to give up. Even if we had no hope we wouldn't give up. But we do have hope because the argument is a sensible good argument.' 

Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop revealed on Wednesday that Sukumaran's mother hugged her tightly and begged her to save her son from the firing squad.   

'My last meeting with Mrs Sukumaran she hugged me so tightly I could hardly breathe,' Ms Bishop told Nine's Today show.

'No person could fail to be touched by the anguish of the families.' 

The Foreign Minister said while the pair's lawyers were lodging an appeal, she hoped Indonesia would see the 'value in these men's lives' as the federal government seeks a stay of execution.

Ms Bishop said both men have been rehabilitated in the most remarkable way and were helping to rehabilitate other prisoners in Bali

'We continue to appeal to President Joko Widodo's sense of generosity and his sense of forgiveness and hope that he will consider these clemency pleas and that there will be a stay of execution.'

Ms Bishop said she wasn't understating the gravity of their drug crimes, but noted it was 10 years ago and they had made efforts to rehabilitate with Chan now a priest and Sukumaran being an accomplished artist.

'Both men have been rehabilitated in the most remarkable way. They are adding value to prison life in that they are working with other prisoners.

'They are rehabilitating other prisoners and helping Indonesia with this whole process of rehabilitating people, such as drug offenders.'
