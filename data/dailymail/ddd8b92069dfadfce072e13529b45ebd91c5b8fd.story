Investigators say the teenage daughter of the suspect who shot and killed his longtime girlfriend and her cousin tried to wrestle the gun from her father, thinking she was about to become his next victim.

Instead,  Eduardo Felix Escobar of Selma, California pulled the gun from his daughter's grip and shot himself. 

He died at a hospital later.

The Fresno County Coroner's Office and Selma police identified those who died Monday as 36-year-old Johana Loza Cervantes and 31-year-old Jessica Emmanuel Cervantes, her cousin.

Police provided details of the murder-suicide at a Tuesday press conference in Northern California.

According to The Fresno Bee, 'Escobar showed up at that house around 2:15 p.m. Monday with his 14-year-old daughter, who immediately went inside to talk to her mom.'

As this was happening, Emmanuel Cervantes confronted Escobar outside, and following an argument a gunshot rang out.

Chief Greg Garner said the couple had seven children together and that their 14-year-old daughter witnessed the murders then watched her father kill himself.

'She opened the door of the residence to see her father shooting Jessica Cervantes several times,' said Chief Garner.

'As she attempted to close the door, Mr. Escobar fired one round at the residence, striking the front door. He then made entry into the house and confronted Giovanni.'

Escobar had a history of violent behavior, and at the time of the shooting a warrant was out for his arrest. 

A preliminary toxicology report showed that he was high on meth when the incident occurred.
