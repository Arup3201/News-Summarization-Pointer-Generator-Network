Unite chief Len McCluskey today praised shadow health secretary Andy Burnham as the best performer on the Labour front bench

Militant union boss Len McCluskey said it ‘wouldn’t matter’ if Ed Miliband was run over by a bus.

The general secretary of Unite stuck the knife into the Labour leader – by saying the politician he most respected was potential rival Andy Burnham.

And he said he had still not decided whether he liked Mr Miliband – four years after he became leader.

Mr Burnham, the former Health Secretary, is understood to be canvassing MPs to see if he can count on their support in a future leadership bid.

While Mr Miliband had a terrible party conference, making a widely-derided speech in which he forgot to mention the deficit or immigration, Mr Burnham received a lengthy standing ovation.

He has pleased the left of the party – and the unions – by campaigning on what he claims is the privatisation of the NHS.

Earlier this month, Labour nearly lost the Heywood and Middleton by-election to UKIP – sparking fresh speculation over mr Miliband’s leadership.

Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 PM programme, Mr McCluskey said: ‘Ed, and I hope this doesn’t happen, could get run over by a bus tomorrow, and it really wouldn’t matter who takes his place.

‘What matters is the policies. We’ve been saying this to Ed since he got elected. Labour have got to show that they are on the side of ordinary working people.

‘If he does that, he’ll be the next prime minister. If he fails to do that, then of course, he’ll be defeated and he’ll be replaced as the leader. And therein lies a huge challenge to Ed.’

Mr McCluskey said he thought Mr Miliband was a ‘decent man’ but he did not know him well enough to say whether he likes him or not.

‘He’s a decent man. I’m not sure the last time [we talked] we had a laugh,’ he said.

‘I don’t really know him well enough to say I like him. Any talk about “is he the right guy”, it really doesn’t enter into our vocabulary. I know that when I speak to him in private, I see a passionate guy, I see a guy who’s committed to certain things.’

It would not matter if Ed Miliband 'full under a bus', Mr McCluskey said - because it was all about the policies that the Labour party took up rather than the leader

Asked who on the Labour front bench he most respects, Mr McCluskey said: ‘To be honest with you the person who impresses me most is Andy Burnham.’

Mr McCluskey accused the Labour leadership of not taking the UKIP threat seriously enough – something which nearly cost them a by-election in the north west, an area which should be rock-solid Labour.

‘We made it clear to the Labour party over a year ago, that if they thought UKIP were just a concern for the Tories, then they were wrong,’ he said.

‘The truth is that Ed speaks about “we’re listening and we know we’ve got to change”. At the moment we’re seeing a lot of listening but not a great deal of change.

‘Who knows what could happen. We were in spitting distance of losing a safe Labour seat, that’s why UKIP have got to be challenged.’

The Unite leader revealed he was a big fan of Downton Abbey, and doing karaoke to the Beatles.

‘You’ll go back to the times where there was almost a paternalistic [aspect] to society, some of the huge corporations,’ she said. ‘There’s a paternalism which was as part of, I suppose, trying to share the wealth.

‘I’m a big fan of Downton Abbey. Although it’s a bit sanitised, you reflect this paternalistic approach.’

He added: ‘I like karaoke. I like Beatles songs, my favourite song is In My Life. I can sing a nice song.’
