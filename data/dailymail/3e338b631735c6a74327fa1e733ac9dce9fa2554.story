Bad behaviour: Jody A. Degen engaged in a sex act in front of a crowd and then spat on and kicked a sheriff's deputy who arrested her

The site which is described as ‘a beautiful tree-lined site right along the river’ is also known locally for hosting wild parties for young adults who drink, and dance and enjoy the activities on offer.

A YouTube video lays bare a party taking place on the grounds of the site with bikini-clad women and men dancing to techno and hip hop music whilst drinking beside a lake.

Yet, although the site is known to play host to wild parties onlookers were stunned after Ms Degen committed the lewd act on Dustin R. Wolf in the middle of the afternoon.

Eyewitnesses described how Ms Degen performed the act on Mr Wolf, 30 also from South Dakota.

According to court records, several campers were disgusted by her outlandish behaviour and called the police.

However, when police arrived, Ms Degen, who was topless, allegedly spat and kicked a deputy.

Police arrested both Ms Degen and Mr Wolf, but Mr Wolf has not been charged.

In court, Ms Degen had several other charges dismissed against her.

The charges included: throwing or discharging bodily fluid at a public safety worker and battery to law enforcement officers, firefighters or commission wardens, sexual gratification and disorderly conduct.

Apple River Hideaway, has camping facilities which cater for kids as young as five years old. But it also hosts parties which cater to a young crowd of revellers.

According to its website other popular activities include tubing along a river and it touts itself as being close to local concert venues.
