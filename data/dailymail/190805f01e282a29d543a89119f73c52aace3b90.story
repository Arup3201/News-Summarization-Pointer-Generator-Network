Nurses at a world-leading children’s hospital have been so stressed and exhausted that patient safety was at risk, a shocking report reveals.

An internal inquiry at Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool found staff had fainted in operating theatres or been ‘physically and mentally’ unable to perform procedures because of long hours and a ‘culture of fear and bullying’ by management.

The report, leaked to The Mail on Sunday after the hospital was forced to release it under Freedom of Information laws, found that some nurses had contemplated suicide and many were distressed after being forced to cover high levels of sickness absence.

The nurses complained that the number of staff on sick leave was higher than those available to work.

The Trust deals with seriously ill children who are often in need of complicated, specialist care.

Hospital managers admitted the document is ‘disturbing’ and insisted changes have been made since it was written in 2010.

But Dr Peter Carter, head of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘We are calling for the Trust board to urgently clarify what is going on and it’s not enough to say that things have changed.’
