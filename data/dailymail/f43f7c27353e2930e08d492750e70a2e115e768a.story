Lined up in front of nine tiny bodies shrouded in cloth, these men would never have expected their daughters to die before them.

But the girls, aged between nine and 11, were killed in a bomb blast as they were collecting firewood for their families.

Today, the distraught villagers laid them to rest in a grim funeral ceremony. The girls died when a landmine  left over from the time of the Soviet invasion went off outside their village in Nangarhar province in eastern Afghanistan.

It happened in a day of violence yesterday which also saw a car bomb killing two in the capital Kabul.

The second blast outside a 
compound housing a U.S. military contractor killed at least two Afghan 
workers and wounded more than a dozen other people, company 
representatives and police said.

It sent a plume of smoke up in the air and shook windows more than a mile away in the city centre.

The security officer for Contrack, a 
McLean, Virginia-based company that builds facilities for military 
bases, said a suicide attacker drove a vehicle packed with explosives up
to the exterior wall of the compound and detonated the bomb.

Afghan police could not immediately 
confirm whether it was a suicide attack or a remotely detonated bomb 
placed in a parked vehicle.

Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid 
claimed responsibility for the attack, saying in an email to reporters 
that it was a suicide car bomber who targeted the compound because it 
was company working with the government.

The victims of the landmine, aged between nine and 11

seriously injured and are in critical condition in hospital.

It was not immediately clear what caused
the explosion - it could have been a bomb
planted by Taliban insurgents or a landmine left over from decades of 
conflict.

The day before 17
people were killed and more than 70 hurt in a car bomb attack on a 
market in the Khyber tribal area in north-west Pakistan.

Women and children were among those 
killed in the blast at the market in Jamrud, the main town in Khyber. 
The injured - many of whom are said to be in critical condition - are 
being treated at a hospital in Peshawar.

The explosion - which as yet no group has taken account for -  took place close to the offices of the tribal administration. 

The
bombing comes just one day after a 15-hour stand-off between militants 
and security forces at Peshawar airport, just six miles east of Jamrud 
town.

At least 17 people were killed and around 50 injured in a blast in Jamrud Bazar in Khyber, one of seven districts in the volatile region along the Afghan border

The Pakistani Taliban has said they carried out that attack, during which at least 10 militants were killed, many of them ethnic Uzbek fighters.

Vehicles and buildings were damaged during the latest blast in the busy market area.

It is believed explosives were planted in a vehicle parked close to an area of the market which has a lot of car workshops.

It is unclear what the target of the attack was.

Many of the injured are said to be in critical condition

As yet - no group has laid claim to the attack

The blast took place close to the office of the assistant political agent for Khyber, one of the top local government officials in the semi-autonomous region.

Many of those wounded are said to be in a critical condition.

Several militant groups, including the Pakistani Taliban and local insurgent group Lashkar-e-Islam, are believed to have sanctuaries in the Khyber region.

In Afghanistan the Ten girls who have been killed were collecting firewood  outside their village in Nangarhar province in eastern Afghanistan.

They were walking through land near the 
porous border with Pakistan, which is infested with some of the world's 
most dangerous militant groups.

'Unfortunately, 10 little girls were 
killed and two others wounded but we don't know whether it was planted 
by the Taliban,' said Ahmadzia Abdulzai, provincial government 
spokesman.

Women and children are often the victims of the war between the Taliban and U.S.-led NATO and Afghan forces, now in its eleventh year.

Many Afghans are growing increasingly worried that the nation could face another civil war or a major Taliban push to seize power again when most NATO combat troops withdraw by the end of 2014.

Meanwhile a blast in a market in northwest Pakistan killed at least 15 people, a security official said.
