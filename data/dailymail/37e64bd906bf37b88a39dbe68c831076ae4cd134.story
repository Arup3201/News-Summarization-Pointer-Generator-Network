An anguished father says he was saddened to receive an 'impersonal’ form letter from the president regarding the death of his son in Afghanistan - as it is revealed that the White House has been sending the same exact letters to families of fallen troops for years.

Back in January, Tom Logan, of Willis, Texas, was ecstatic when it appeared that his son, USMC Cpl Joseph Logan, had come home on a surprise visit.

But the man at the door that day was not Joseph. He was a fellow Marine who had come to deliver the heartbreaking news that Mr Logan’s youngest son had been killed in action.

Heartbreak: Four months after his son's death, Tom Logan said he was saddened all over again when a UPS delivery truck brought a letter of condolence from President Obama

Cpl Logan was one of six Marines who were killed when a chopper went down in Afghanistan’s Helmand Province on January 19.

'He was a good kid,' Mr Logan told KPRC while fighting back tears, 'and he’s not going to come back anymore.'

But four months after his death, Mr Logan said he was saddened all over again when a UPS delivery truck brought a letter of condolence from President Obama.

Speaking to KPRC in Houston, Mr Logan called it a form letter that was 'impersonal' and 'disrespectful.'

Form letters have been used to delivers condolences to bereaved families of servicemen for many years.

However Mr Logan told the station: ‘It opened up a 
wound - a hole in our heart that you can’t fix. You can’t send another 
letter. You can't make it right.'

A subsequent investigation by KPRC found that the letters sent by the White House to the families of fallen troops are carbon copies of each other- except for names and ranks.

In addition, Gateway Pundit found that the same form letters date back as far as 2009 for soldiers, Navy SEALs and Marines.

Nancy Beck Young, a professor and historian at the University of Houston, said different presidents have approached the task of writing such letters in line with their personalities and priorities.

After examining the letter written to Mr
Logan, she said: 'I would agree, this is a personal sacrifice and an 
impersonal condolence.'

Young said that it appears Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush, wrote more personalised notes, some of them hand-written.

Form letters, she added, were a trait of the modern age.

'I think it's an indication of how the office of the presidency works in the early 21st century,' she told KPRC in Houston.

Mr Logan believes it should never work that way.

'Where are the representatives of our
government? Where is the honor and the respect that all of these 
soldiers deserve?' he said.

The White House did not respond to repeated requests for comment by KPRC.
