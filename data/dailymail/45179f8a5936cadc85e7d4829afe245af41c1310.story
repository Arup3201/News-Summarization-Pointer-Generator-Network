As a massive snowstorm dumps the white stuff on New York City, footage from thermal imaging cameras taken late at night are showing the resolve of Wall Street protesters.

In images that look like they came directly out of the Arnold Schwarzenegger film Predator, some protesters can be seen standing around Zuccotti Park while others are huddled inside tents.

Temperatures, which plunged below 40 degrees last night, weren’t raining on the parade of Occupy Wall Street protesters, who remained in their tents overnight.

The same could not be said for their counterparts in a much warmer London, as the same thermal imaging showed protesters were deserting their tents near St Paul’s cathedral as the sun went down.

In the New York shots, taken late on Friday night, the presence of body heat from humans is represented by yellow and red inside the tents.

Roughing it: Unseasonably cold temperatures as well as snow and rain is making the protests difficult for those involved in the Occupy Wall Street movement

Also on Friday, city authorities took away the generators they were using to keep warm and power electronic devices.

An Occupy Wall Street spokesman said
 this was 'a pretext to make the protest less sustainable and more 
difficult for us', but authorities insisted they had to remove the 
equipment for safety reasons.

But New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the six generators and fuel were confiscated because they were considered a safety hazard and it was not an effort to remove protesters.

Bloomberg told local radio: 'As long as they don't take away anybody else's rights to say what they want to say, or to not say anything, to go about their business safely... at the moment it will continue.'

A blanket of cold air that brought the
 first flurries of the season to Colorado on Wednesday is continuing to 
spread south and east, bringing the lowest temperatures to the Northeast since spring.

The unusually early snow is bad news 
for those camping in city centres across the country, as critics speculate that the days of the Occupy movement may now be numbered.

But some of the protesters are resilient.

Rene, a 25-year-old protester who came from Occupy Miami to Occupy Wall Street told the New York Post: 'I got my blanket, I got my sleeping bag and I got my girl - so it’s not hard to stay warm.'

He added: 'The weather won’t dissuade me. I’m here through the thick and thin until the tear gas rolls in.'

Resolve: Rain, snow and near-freezing temperatures could not keep members of the Occupy Wall Street movement out of Zuccotti Park today

For
 the last 46 days, protesters - who are angry about corporate greed, 
inequality of wealth and lack of public health care provision - have 
occupied a park near Wall Street in Manhattan, New York.

'I
 welcome the challenge of this cold weather. This is like war. You know,
 soldiers do it when they occupy a place. I'm sure the mountains of 
Afghanistan get pretty cold'

Dwayne Hudson, Denver protester

The demonstrations have grown, spreading across the country and to other cities around the world in recent weeks.

Several Occupy Denver protesters had to be taken to hospital on Thursday night to be treated for
 hypothermia.

'I welcome the challenge of this cold weather,' protester
 Dwayne Hudson said. 'This is like war. You know, soldiers do it when 
they occupy a place. I'm sure the mountains of Afghanistan get pretty 
cold.'

Living outdoors is taking its toll. Lael Gillette, 27, an unemployed chef from Rockford, Illinois, has had only two hours of sleep in three days at the camp. 'I would rather there was another option,' he said.

Protesters
 have erected tents and tarpaulins over parts of Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan, but 
appeared to be failing in their battle to keep warm and dry.

Snowscene: The unusually early snow is bad news for those camping in city centres across the country.

Resilient: 25 protesters slept at the Occupy Denver camp overnight on Wednesday even as the winter snow storm moved in. Several were taken to the hospital for hypothermia.

Authorities will welcome the dramatic
 weather forecast. Law enforcement officials in some cities such as Oakland, 
California, have cleared out protests.

But Mayor Bloomberg said there is little he can do
about the New York protest until the owners of the park where the camp is located, Brookfield 
Office Properties, file a complaint.

Earlier
 this month he suggested that many protesters were only 
camping out because of the unusually warm autumn weather.

Snow this heavy this early is highly 
unusual along and near I-95 in the Northeast. In Philadelphia, the 
average date for the first accumulating snow is December 18.

Stoic: A blanket of cold air, that brought the first flurries of the season to Colorado on Wednesday, is continuing to spread south and east, bringing the lowest temperatures since last spring.

Volunteers are being vigilant and do nightly checks for signs of hypothermia among the faithful.

'There’s meditations that you can do to 
heat yourself up. Hot thoughts. Like summer, or fire, anything that’s 
hot, you know what I'm saying? And it works'

Ed, New York protester

Ed, a 56-year-old volunteer medic from Maine, told New York magazine, 'It’s a combination of being wet and cold that starts the hypothermia. We patrol at night looking for people shivering.'

Trench
 foot is also becoming a problem. Jeremy, a 25-year-old who has been 
homeless for three years has come up with a homemade solution.

He explained: 'I
 actually originated using newspaper - newspaper and cellophane. You put
 the cellophane on first, and then you put the newspaper, and that keeps
 you warm,

'And there’s 
meditations that you can do to heat yourself up. Hot thoughts. Like 
summer, or fire, anything that’s hot, you know what I'm saying? And it 
works.'
