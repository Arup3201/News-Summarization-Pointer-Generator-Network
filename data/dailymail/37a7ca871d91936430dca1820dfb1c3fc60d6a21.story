A young girl's quick thinking and protective instincts helped police capture two burglars who broke into a Chattanooga, Tennessee home Saturday.

Bre'Asia Morrow, 12, and her 11-year-old sister Azariah were home alone that day when two men broke in through the backdoor.

Bre'Asia remained calm as she called police to report the burglary.

The girls were sitting on the top-bunk in their bedroom when they heard the two men attempt to break in.

Bre'Asia called 911 and the operator, Amanda Miller, told her to find a safe palce to hide so she took her sister into their bedroom closet.

She says one of the men came into their bedroom while they were hiding and grabbed some cash on a dresser, but didn't notice them.

She stayed on the phone with the operator until police arrived, relaying everything that was going on through whispers.

'You're doing a great job, you're very brave okay, you just stay right where you're at,' Ms Miller said.

Police say they were after the family's televisions and computers.

Because of Bre'Asia's quick thinking, police were able to arrest the two men while they were still in the house.

Burglars Zacakaree Howard, 19, and Carlos, Jones, 18, have now been charged with aggravated burglary and vandalism.

Little-sister Azariah thanks her big sister for protecting her.

'She really told me stuff. She was telling me I'm glad you're okay and stuff. That's good that they didn't find us,' Azariah told WTVC. 'And we were keeping calm, my sister told me it was good that I kept calm.

Operator Miller was surprised by how composed the 12-year-old was under stress.

'If she keeps that cool head through her whole life, she will be successful,' Miller said.

After the incident, the girls' father said he might get a guard dog, and may take his daughters to weapons training when they are older.
