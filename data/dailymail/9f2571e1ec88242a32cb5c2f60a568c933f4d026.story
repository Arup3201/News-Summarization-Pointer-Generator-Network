The grieving mother of a baby who died just hours after his birth has claimed two hospitals would not admit her when she started bleeding heavily.

Christina Evans says Good Hope and Birmingham Women’s Hospitals both said they were unable to treat her as they were full.

Jayden Lee Potts’ short life came to an end just hours after he was born, 16 weeks early, at Birmingham City Hospital.

Christina Evans (pictured with her daughter, Elisha) says two hospitals were unable to admit her when she started bleeding heavily six weeks before her due date with baby Jayden

His mother said that before she was admitted to City Hospital and underwent a Caesarean section, both Birmingham Women’s and Good Hope Hospitals informed ambulance crews they didn’t have the capacity to admit her.

The 25-year-old, from Rhyl, north east Wales, was visiting her father in Kingstanding, Birmingham, when the tragedy occurred.

She has now called for a review of emergency hospital spaces for women in premature labour.

‘It was horrible,’ she said. ‘It felt like no-one cared about us.

‘Jayden was born after an emergency Caesarean section and weighed just 1lbs 9oz. I don’t ever want another woman to have to go through what I did.’

Ms Evans’ brother called 999 when she started bleeding heavily while staying with her father on November 1.

She started bleeding because her placenta had ruptured.

Ms Evans was eventually admitted to Birmingham City Hospital after being told Good Hope and Birmingham Women's Hospitals were too full. Jayden was delivered by C section but died soon afterwards

She claims paramedics spent precious moments calling hospitals in a bid to find a place for her to deliver Jayden.

A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service said: ‘Being a visitor from north Wales, the patient was not booked into a maternity unit in Birmingham to have the birth.

‘As such, and to avoid the possibility of having to make a subsequent hospital transfer, the ambulance crew rang round local hospitals to establish who was able to accept her.

‘The situation was being explained to the patient while the ambulance crews were making the enquiries with hospitals.

Good Hope Hospital says it's surprised Ms Evans was told by paramedics that she could not be taken there

‘The first hospital to accept was City Hospital and she was taken there straight away.’

Following the tragedy, Ms Evans is now back in Rhyl with her partner Kriston, 21, and four-year-old daughter, Elisha.

Concerns premature maternity services could be critically over-stretched have heightened after bosses at Birmingham Women’s Hospital admitted they were full to bursting on the night Ms Evans needed treatment.

Birmingham Women's Hospital says it would have been 'clinically unsafe' to admit Ms Evans that evening as the hospital was very full

Chief executive at the hospital, Professor Ros Keeton, said it would have been ‘clinically unsafe’ to admit the mother.

She said: ‘We are very sorry to hear of Mrs Evans’ traumatic experience and extend our sympathies for her loss.

‘We would like to reassure the public that Birmingham Women’s Hospital would never turn away an emergency patient because she wasn’t from the area and, indeed, we accept emergencies on a regular basis.

Ms Evans says she hopes no other woman ever has to go through what she experienced

‘The only reasons we would decline such an admission would be if we did not have the capacity to take a woman or her baby, and to do so would be clinically unsafe.

‘On this particular evening we could not offer the neonatal intensive care cot which Jayden would have needed, as all of our 39 cots were full.

‘The cross-city policy is for such emergencies to be referred to the unit with the specialist resources available.’

Maggie Coleman, matron and site lead for Maternity Clinical Services at Good Hope Hospital, said: 'We would like to send our sincerest condolences to Ms Evans at this very sad time. The safety and care of women and their unborn babies is our top priority and we have strict guidelines stating a woman would never be refused admittance to our maternity unit.

'Good Hope Hospital is a designated level 1, Special Care Baby Unit (SCBU), which provides special care only to premature babies of 34 weeks gestation and above. 

'Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust  is part of the South-West Midlands Newborn Network (SWMNN), and has a level 1 unit at Good Hope Hospital and a level 3 unit at Heartlands Hospital.

'We take patient feedback very seriously and are surprised to hear that the paramedics told Ms Evans that we refused to admit her. I would urge Ms Evans to get in touch with us directly so we can investigate her concerns.'

Jayden’s parents have also lodged a complaint against Birmingham City Hospital, alleging a delay in providing a death certificate meant they could not take the baby’s body home for a week.

A spokesman for Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs City Hospital, said: ‘The death of any baby is very tragic and we understand that this is a difficult time for Christina and her family.

‘We have already provided a full and detailed response to Christina regarding the issues she has raised and would like to reiterate our sincere condolences to Christina and her family.’
