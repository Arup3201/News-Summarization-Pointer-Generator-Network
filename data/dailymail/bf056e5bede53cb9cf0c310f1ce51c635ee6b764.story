With their thick beards, stern warrior-like features and sculpted torsos, they are models of manliness.

But now the 2,500-year old Riace Bronzes have lost a little of their masculine dignity- after they were dressed up in a pink feather boa and a leopard print thong.

The ancient Greek warrior statues, one of Italy’s most revered archaeological discoveries, were found at the bottom of the sea in 1972, and recently went on display after a lengthy restoration.

But their exhibition in a museum in Southern Italy has proved divisive after a photographer dressed the towering and life-like statues in a white tulle veil, fuchsia boa and leopard print underwear.

French photographer Gerald Bruneau, a protegee of Andy Warhol, said the provocative gesture was a jokey comment on the gay marriage debate.

He said: 'Down in the south of Italy the men are very macho and conservative and are very upset by the idea of gay marriage. But the ancient Greeks had no problem with homosexuality.'

'Some people will be scandalised but it was supposed to be joyful and reflect the times.' He says he was given permission to shoot the warriors in a veil but then spotted the other items at market stall.

Simonetta Binomi, head of Reggio Calabria's National Archaeological Museum, said the photos were 'terrible' and 'in bad taste'.

She said permission had been given to Bruneau because an earlier shoot with a veil had been done tastefully but they were unaware of the controversial attire.

The realistic warriors, one old and one younger, date from the 5th Century BC.They were discovered by a holiday-maker who, when diving, saw an arm sticking out of the seabed off the Italian coast.

They are extremely fragile state and have just been restored so the prospect of someone with no expertise touching and dressing the statues raises concerns about how well they are being cared for.

A local politician has now demanded a judicial inquiry. Politician Ignazio Messina of the conservative Italy of Values party said: ‘It cannot be art if it mocks a cultural treasure.’
