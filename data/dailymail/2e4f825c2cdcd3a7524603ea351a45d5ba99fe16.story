Chef Kevin Viner, who runs Michelin-starred Viners Bar and Restaurant in Truro, Cornwall, has been the victim of an ongoing dispute with his landlord

A wealthy businessman has been given a suspended prison sentence after refusing to let go of an on-going dispute with an internationally acclaimed chef.

Landlord Eric Randle tried to evict chef Kevin Viner from the Michelin-starred Viners Bar and Restaurant based in his multimillion-pound Carvynick Country Club near Truro over a row about rent and utility bills.

Randle admitted cutting off electricity to Viners in July last year, forcing the chef to cook on a barbecue during a wedding party, and was ordered to pay the chef's legal bill of £16,781 and given an injunction forcing him not to interfere with the chef's business.

But Randle refused to let the matter drop and was witnessed threatening Mr Viner at his restaurant in October, telling him: 'You have no right, this is my f***ing pub. I am going to finish you.

'You don't have the money to fight me. I don't care about the injunction or the police.'

Randle also threatened to sabotage a grease trap in the garden of the restaurant which would have forced grease to back up into the kitchen during a busy Saturday service.

Mr Viner, who has been named Britain's best chef, took proceedings against his former friend at Truro County Court 'as a last resort' to salvage his reputation and business.

The chef said he was 'hanging on by his fingernails' and in fear of Randle who 'had a temper'.

He said: 'I was crying all the time. I was in a state. I had put my whole future into the restaurant. I am a reputable chef and my life has been destroyed.'

Randle was found to have breached the injunction and given a 28-day jail sentence suspended for two years.

Randle, who said he would appeal, was ordered to make an interim payment of £7,500 for legal costs.

Judge Barry Cotter, QC, said the suspended jail threat was needed to ensure Randle complies with the injunction but should not be seen as the 'sword of Damocles' hanging over him.

Judge Cotter called it a 'sad and protracted case' that was aggravated by Randle's false statements, contempt of court and failure to purge his contempt during the two day hearing.
