He had been caught stealing from a house but this young thief probably never imagined how swiftly he would be punished.

Hog-tied and helpless, he was placed on an anthill to be bitten repeatedly by insects as the vigilantes who had caught looked on.

They showed no mercy as his screams rent the air in the Brazilian city of Teresina.   

Man accused of stealing thrown on anthill by residents

Video of the incident, which took place in the neighbourhood of Dirceu has been posted on Facebook. It is also on Liveleak.com.

It is unclear what happened to the man next and what injuries he sustained as a result of the incident.

Comments on the video, which has been posted on Facebook, suggest some Brazilians are resorting to vigilante acts to ensure criminals are punished, having lost faith in their judicial system.

Teresina is the capital of the State of Piaui, Brazil. It is known as one of the hottest cities of Brazil.
