A hilarious spoof trailer of the film Gravity, which sees a couple panicking as they become lost in the vast expanse of an Ikea store, has racked up over 500,000 YouTube hits in just four days.

The video called Alfonso Cuarón's Ikea, by New York-based director and writer Daniel Hubbard is a direct parody of the science fiction thriller starring George Clooney and Sandra Bullock.

It begins with the lines: 'At over 346,000 square feet. There is no sense of direction. No silence. Bad cell service. It’s like way too big. Life in IKEA is impossible.’

shuttle is destroyed

The couple are then seen negotiating an Ikea store's seemingly endless racks of shelves before they become separated with the woman ending up in the warehouse department.

Among the most memorable lines are 'My phone's at 13 per cent! It's going to die!' and 'Why did we even come here? Anything we buy is just going to break anyway.'

The video was shown to staff at Ikea's headquarters in Sweden who seemed to be amused.

'We think it's fun,' Johanna Blomkvist, spokeswoman at Ikea Sweden, told The Local:  'Parody is a kind of flattery so we enjoyed it.'

Gravity, directed by Alfonso Cuarón, is currently at the top of the UK box office taking an impressive £6.2million.

Clooney and Bullock play two astronauts who are trying to return to Earth after becoming stranded in space when their space shuttle is destroyed.
