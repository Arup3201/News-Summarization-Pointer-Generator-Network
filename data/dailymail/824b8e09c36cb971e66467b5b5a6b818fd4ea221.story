The prime suspect in the brutal double knife murder of a young couple was under arrest in hospital today after apparently trying to take his own life.

Police say a 31-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of the murder of the hotel workers, both aged 20, who were both found stabbed to death in the blood-spattered staff quarters next to the Radisson Edwardian Hotel in Harlington, near Heathrow Airport.

The suspect, who was held at an address in nearby Hillingdon, is now under arrest at a west London hospital where he was being treated for 'wrist and neck injuries'. A knife was also recovered.

Investigation: A police cordon today remained in place on New Road, Harlington, next to the Radisson Edwardian Heathrow hotel, west London

The grisly discovery of the couple - 
one is understood to be English, the other East European - was made by a
concerned colleague at the Radisson Edwardian Hotel and conference 
centre on Wednesday.

A source close to the case claimed yesterday the man died from over 20 knife wounds, while the woman had her throat cut.

It was also claimed that the woman thought to have been murdered had only worked at the hotel on reception for around two weeks.

Their bodies were later removed from the staff quarters which is in a semi-detached building behind the hotel. 

A source who did not wish to be 
named, told MailOnline yesterday: 'The three people were supposed to be 
going into work for duty at 7am yesterday morning, but when they didn't 
show up one of the reception managers went looking for them.

'I have heard it was a complete 
bloodbath - the girl had her throat cut and the man was stabbed over 20 
times, it sounded horrific.

'I believe the three of them all knew each other, but something happened which caused a massive row and it all boiled over.

'I'm amazed it has happened - the hotel is one of the best around.'

A spokesperson for the Radisson 
Edwardian hotel, which is popular with commuters and those using nearby 
Heathrow Airport, would not comment.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Detectives investigating a double murder in Hillingdon have arrested a man this morning.  

'A 31-year-old man was arrested in 
Harlington on suspicion of two murders. He is currently under arrest at a
west London hospital, where he was receiving treatment for wrist and 
neck injuries.  

'Police were called at 3.15pm on 
Wednesday following concerns for the welfare of occupants at an address 
in New Road, Harlington.  

'Officers attended and discovered the
bodies of a man and woman, both aged 20, at the premises. They suffered
stab wounds. Next of kin have been informed and formal identification 
awaits. A knife has been recovered.  

'The Homicide and Serious Crime 
Command is investigating and inquiries are currently on-going at the 
scene.' Post-mortems were due to be conducted later today.'
