The former drummer for the Faces and The Who has put forward plans for a world class equestrian arena, boutique hotel and country homes at a polo club where the Royals have played.

Kenney Jones, 66, hopes to expand the Hurtwood Park club in  Surrey, where Prince Harry, William and Charles have showcased their polo talents.

But the plans submitted by Mr Jones - who played alongside Rod Stewart when they were in the Faces - has been met with almost 100 objections from local residents.

The application includes plans for 14 new homes, a five star hotel and luxury spa attached to the club house

They are concerned about the strain the extra traffic will have on the area and the impact it will have on the environment. 

Mr Jones, who first made his name as a member of the Small Faces, hopes to construct the UK's first all-weather polo and equestrian estate with stables for 78 horses.

He also hopes to build 14 new homes for 'equestrian enthusiasts' and a five-star 74-bedroom hotel and luxury spa attached to the existing clubhouse. 

The former drummer and father-of-six has said the application will boost the local economy, provide it with an estimated 639 jobs and improve the facilities in the local area. 

Equestrian bodies — including the Federation of International Polo, the British Equestrian Federation, the Hurlingham Polo Association and the Pony Club — have welcomed the new development.

Mr Jones said: 'It's great to receive such strong support from the polo and equestrian communities, who have recognised the exciting opportunity that the expanded facilities at Hurtwood can provide to the UK.

'We have also been overwhelmed by the support shown by the community in Ewhurst, having received over 100 letters of support.

'I want to save the future of Hurtwood Park and protect the open, green space.

'We want to make sure we keep polo and equestrian activity at Hurtwood Park and create something that respects Ewhurst as a rural, village environment whilst bringing something special to the area.

'The planning application is intended to provide a facility that preserves the site as a rural equestrian venue and create something local people can be proud of.'

However the application has received almost 100 objections from the local community. 

Campaign group Save Ewhurst's Environment particularly oppose to the proposed 14 new homes describing it as the 'tip of the iceberg'. 

There are also fears it would lead to the area being swamped with development, of the threat it will pose to the environment and the extra traffic it will create. 

Neighbours say a polo tournament earlier this year attracted more than 1,600 cars, leading to huge jams and nearly 300 cars were abandoned due to heavy rain.

Henning von Spreckelsen, who opposes the plans, said: 'It is disingenuous to suggest that this  polo club can suddenly turn into a national centre of excellence with only a small handful of wealthy players wanting to live on site.'

On the application Nick Aust, from Ewhurst, wrote: 'I feel it would put an excessive strain on the village and also hurt the beautiful surroundings we currently enjoy.'

Another, Duane Ayres wrote: 'The application is just a smoke-screen for a massive housing development. The land is clay and not suitable for polo ponies and is underwater for most of the winter.'  

But former resident Jacki Marshall, who used the polo club as a wedding venue for her daughter, said: 'Having seen their ideas for the site, and knowing that something has to change, this seems to be a wonderful opportunity for the local community.

'It would be a great enhancement to the area to have a good hotel, spa and restaurant, which could bring more jobs and opportunity to the local population.

'Jayne and Kenney Jones have lived in the area for a good number of years. Surely it is always favourable to have someone who has clearly enjoyed living in the Ewhurst area to apply and get the planning they require.' 

On his Facebook page, Kenney Jones outlines the reasons to support the expansion of his polo club

The club is currently licensed for 10 major events a year, each with a maximum attendance of 5,000 people.

Mr Jones has told Waverley Borough Council the fourteen country houses will be 'discreetly integrated' into mature woodland and built around a grazing area.

A transport assessment submitted as part of the planning application estimates only one extra car a minute would travel through Ewhurst village at peak times and horsebox traffic would be directed away from the village. 

Mr Jones created a private polo field on the land after moving to Ewhurst in the late 1980s.

He quickly turned it into a proper club, hosting star-studded international matches, charity events and concerts.

He said he and his wife, former model Jayne Andrew, are proud to have a 20-year record of commitment to Hurtwood Park and to be part of the Ewhurst community.

He said: 'We want to create something that puts Waverley even more firmly on the map. Our aim is to get leading equestrians living on the site, people living on Hurtwood Park who have an inherent interest in making sure that its current use is maintained for the long term.'

The plans, submitted to the Waverley borough council, have so far received 90 objections and 117 supporters. A decision target has been set for December 12.
