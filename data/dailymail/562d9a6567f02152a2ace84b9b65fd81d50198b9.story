A healthy eating campaign funded by the taxpayer has come under fire for giving free advertising to junk food firms.

Shoppers are being offered money off fizzy drinks, tinned vegetables and ready meals with vouchers sent to more than 100,000 people who want to improve their diet.

Now the government has been accused of ‘endorsing’ companies like Pepsi and Uncle Ben’s while 'doing nothing' to tackle the nation’s obesity crisis.

More than 100,000 people have been sent Smart Swap packs after signing up online

The campaign has been condemned for giving free advertising to firms like Pepsi, Flora and Uncle Ben's while appearing to endorse fizzy drinks, ready meals and tinned vegetables

The Smart Swaps campaign was launched by Change4Life, run by Public Health England, last month.

It encourages people to switch from unhealthy food and drink to low fat, low sugar alternatives.

People who sign up are sent money off vouchers, fridge magnets and a ‘Smart Swapper’ wheel containing advice on how to eat more healthily.

One of the tips on a magnet states: ‘You oughta swap to water.’ But the vouchers enclosed in the same pack include 25p off a 600ml bottle of Pepsi Max and 25p off a 1litre bottle of Robinson Fruit Squash.

After being contacted by MailOnline, Change4Life said the inclusion of sugar-free fizzy drinks is now being 'reviewed'.

The packs also include 30p off a tub of Flora light, £1 off Cheeky Cow cheese and 30p off Green Giant tinned sweetcorn.

There is also a 30p discount on a £1.99 Uncle Ben’s RiceTime, an instant pot snack from the company owned by Mars.

The companies paid nothing to be included in the promotions and just had to offer some form of discount to encourage people to reduce the amount of fat, sugar and calories in their diets. 

The government-backed support for some of the world’s biggest food firms has been condemned by MPs and food experts.

Critics claims the campaign should be focussed on fresh, nutritious food not swapping to food which is just less harmful than full fat alternatives.

The discounts on fizzy drinks have been criticised on Twitter and Facebook

The scheme has also been criticised on social media. On Twitter @Herders76 wrote: ‘Our esteemed & illustrious government have sent me a 25p off Pepsi Max voucher in a healthier you, change for life campaign. Just odd.’

Leanne Herdman added: ‘Was expecting fresh veg/fruit/milk vouchers, disappointed to see fizzy drinks promoted.’

Others argued the government should be promoting fresh British products not ‘junk’.

Tory MP Dr Sarah Wollaston condemned the ‘free advertising’ being given to big name brands.

She told MailOnline: ‘I agree with the principle of swapping, so you have something which is very similar but actually causes less harm.’

Fizzy drinks are one of the biggest causes of obesity in children, she added.

‘If you cannot persuade some parents to stop giving them to children, you could get them to make a less harmful choice.

‘I share the concern that sending people vouchers starts to look a bit more like advertising. There are other mechanisms that much more powerful.’

The Smart Swapper suggests making drinks using fresh fruits and fizzy water, instead of buying branded pop

Dr Wollaston, a former GP and member 
of the health select committees, suggested discounts and offers should 
be offered on low-sugar and low-salt products in store to encourage 
shoppers to switch.

‘Uncle Ben’s and Pepsi are getting a bit of free advertising. It is a form of product endorsement.

‘Do
 I think it’s the best way of reducing harm? No. It is a good way of 
ticking a box and getting endorsement from Her Majesty’s government. Is 
that really going to address the nation’s obesity crisis?’

Tam
 Fry, spokesman for the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘I regard it as 
being straightforward advertising which has been foisted on the 
Department of Health by an industry which wishes to put itself in a good
 light and has convinced DoH it is a brilliant idea.

‘It’s
 just another way in which the punter is being persuaded to go off and 
buy this, that and the other and the only winners are the stores that 
you buy them in.’

Tory MP Dr Sarah Wollaston said the campaign was giving government endorsement to global food brands

Change4Life insists that there are no obesity or dietary related health risks to drinking diet versions of carbonated drinks. 

The campaign highlighted extensive 
consumer research which shows that people need 'swaps' to be as 
simple as possible and to not feel like they are having to give-up their
 favourite foods and drinks.

Professor Kevin Fenton, National Director of Health and Wellbeing, said: 'No company paid to be included within the packs. All organisations that signed up to be Change4Life partners for the campaign were able to support in ways appropriate to the campaigns objectives.

'All partners were asked to supply money off next purchase vouchers to help incentivise families to make healthier swaps and reduce the amount of fat, sugar and calories in their diets.'

Change4Life will consider the results of the campaign and review whether no added sugar carbonated soft drinks is permanently included into the retail guidance.

Prof Fenton added: 'Smart Swaps is about encouraging families to make some easy like-for-like swaps to their diet in January and beyond to remove calories, fat and sugar. 

‘Clearly the "ideal" swap would be from sugary drinks to water, hence the fridge magnet fun reminder ‘you oughta swap to water’, but there are still significant benefits to be had in encouraging a nationwide shift from sugary to sugar-free/diet variants. 

'Research shows there are no obesity/dietary related health risks to drinking diet versions of carbonated drinks.

'In fact, there are significant health benefits to switching from a sugary drink to a diet or sugar free version.’

Chaneg4Life was criticised for a similar campaign in 2011, when it offered £50 worth of vouchers for losing weight.

It
 later emerged that many of the 'deals' on offer were available to 
anyone, and in some cases the same or similar items could be bought more
 cheaply without the vouchers.
