Scott Quigg faces former world champion Paulus Ambunda on September 13 at the Phones 4 U Arena in Manchester in what I believe will be the toughest fight of his career. 

Ambunda won the WBO bantamweight title in 2013 before losing to the hugely talented Tomoki Kameda in the only loss of his career. 

I give Ambunda plenty of credit for taking this fight - it’s been a hard task matching Quigg. His devastating knockout of Tshifhiwa Munyai in his last fight has made many in the division much less forthcoming. Scott asked for the Leo Santa Cruz unification but they simply don’t fancy the fight - we even offered to come to the US and again he was avoided.

Time to shine: Scott Quigg will face Paulus Ambunda in Manchester in September 

As Scott continues to send big statements to the vision, we now hope Belfast’s Carl Frampton can beat Kiko Martinez in September and then we can finally give the public the fight they want to see. It is one of the biggest fights out there and we want to make it.

Also on the Manchester bill, Anthony Crolla continues his impressive march in the lightweight division when he challenges former word champion Gamaliel Diaz and unbeaten star Scotty Cardle faces Sunderland’s Kirk Goodings with the winner becoming the mandatory challenger for Terry Flanagan’s British lightweight title.

Manchester’s Denton Vassell returns in an expected barn burner against Sam Eggington and heavyweight sensation Anthony Joshua will now make his Manchester debut after his Dublin fight was postponed. 

I'm continuing talks with Bob Arum over a fight between Carl Froch and Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr on January 24 in Las Vegas. I wish I had more to say but it's going slowly. We still have the same options of Chavez, James DeGale and Mikkel Kessler. Let's wait and see.

I watched the boxing at the Commonwealth Games very closely, with one eye on who might make a good professional signing. It was nice to see Antony Fowler, my pre-tournament tip, win the gold – he was brilliant.

He was like a little Carl Froch in there, trading away with true grit at times. He’s confident and has talent. I was impressed, as I was by Paddy Barnes, Joe Joyce, Michael Conlan, Josh Taylor and Joe Fitzpatrick. There is some great talent coming through.

Impressive: Hearn tipped Fowler for glory before the games 

What all of them must now decide is whether to stick or twist. All of them will want to win titles as a professional, but the lure of a gold medal in the Rio Olympics is always there. That is a massive appeal for any amateur. The gamble for them would be to wait instead of switching now when their profile is high.

I can reveal here that Ricky Burns’ proposed comeback fight in Manchester on September 13 has been moved because of an elbow injury he picked up against Dejan Zlaticanin. He will now fight on October 4 in Leeds, on a bill including Josh Warrington and Callum Smith. Brian Rose will also make his comeback after his light-middleweight world title challenge in June.

Kell Brook has been in Las Vegas for a week as he prepares for his world title shot at Shawn Porter on August 16. He has adjusted well to the time difference and is training hard. He sounds so confident every time I talk to him. He is looking sensational in sparring and I can’t wait to get out there next week and enjoy the build up to this huge fight.

There has been some noise made about the drug testing arrangements after the fight date was changed and I can confirm that both fighters have now been tested and will be again in the future. I think it’s an extremely important part of our sport that needs close attention.

Chance to shine: Callum Smith will fight on the Kell Brook undercard 

On Brook’s card, I am also using Callum Smith and Luke Campbell, one of our 2012 gold medallists. They have been standout fights for me in the past year. Luke is fighting again after his short break from the sport for family reasons, while Callum does no wrong at the moment. He is such an enormous talent and is heading for a title shot in the next year to 18 months.

They will fight six-rounders and both will be benefit from the experience and exposure.

I will be talking with Nathan Cleverly this week to try to iron out some more details about his rematch with Tony Bellew. The two dates under consideration are still November 1 in Manchester or November 29 in Liverpool.
