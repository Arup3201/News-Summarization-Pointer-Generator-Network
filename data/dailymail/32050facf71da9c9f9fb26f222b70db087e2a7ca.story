Manchester City remain hopeful James Milner will sign a new contract with the club - but fears are growing that the England man may soon be on the move.

Following the 1-1 draw at Everton on January 10, manager Manuel Pellegrini said that he expected the versatile 29-year-old to pen a new deal 'within days'.

But that has not yet happened and while negotiations are ongoing Milner, whose contract expires at the end of the season, is not thought to have a shortage of alternatives.

Milner is yet to sign a new contract at the Etihad, with his current deal expiring at the end of the season

Premier League           11          (8)

Capital One Cup            2           (0)

Champions League       4           (2)         1

FA Cup                          1           (0)         2

It is understood that the former Leeds and Newcastle star is looking for assurances that he will get more playing time and is not convinced he can get those at the Etihad Stadium.

This season he has started 11 Premier League games for City - one shy of last season's tally of 12.

But injuries to key players have boosted Milner's opportunities and he was substituted at half-time in Sunday's 2-0 home defeat by Arsenal.

The Gunners and Liverpool are known admirers amid reports that Milner has received a pre-contract offer from abroad.

With English players at a premium at elite level, the prospect of picking up a domestic international on a free transfer is likely to appeal.

City declined to comment but an Etihad insider told Sportsmail that they remained hopeful a deal would be struck.

Meanwhile, the Premier League champions are thought to be comfortable with their match at Burnley on Saturday March 14 being moved back to a 5.30pm televised kick-off slot ahead of their trip to Barcelona for the second leg of their Champions League clash the following Wednesday.

Pellegrini's men are currently at a training camp in Abu Dhabi and will return on Friday ahead of their FA Cup clash with Middlesbrough on Saturday.
