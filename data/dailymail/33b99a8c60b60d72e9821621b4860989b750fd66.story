Private Martin Bell, a young paratrooper disobeyed a direct order from his commander not to help his stricken friend

He acted with selfless disregard for his own life when confronted with the terror of a colleague grievously-injured in an explosion on the Afghan battlefield.

Private Martin Bell, a young paratrooper with a reputation for remarkable courage, disobeyed a direct order from his commander not to help his stricken friend because his own life would be at risk.

Displaying unimaginable bravery the 24-year-old dashed across land strewn with improvised explosive devices (IEDs) to reach comrade Private Scott Meenagh, who had lost both legs in the blast.

He administered immediate first aid, 
saving his friend’s life. But as he helped pull the injured soldier’s 
stretcher up a steep bank, he tragically triggered a homemade bomb and 
was killed.

Yesterday Private Bell’s proud family were at Buckingham Palace to receive the George Medal he was awarded posthumously.

His
parents Simon and Elaine Bell received the honour - the UK’s second 
highest accolade for valour not in the face of the enemy - privately 
from the Queen before the monarch hosted an investiture ceremony. The 
paratrooper’s brothers Philip and Oliver also attended.

Afterwards they expressed their pride in the heroic soldier, who served with the 2nd Battalion The Parachute Regiment.

Mr Bell said: ‘To say I’m proud is an understatement. He touched so many hearts in his 24 years, if I live to be 424 I’ll never do the same - he was just an amazing son.

‘He was told to stay where he was but could not see Scott.

‘He ran across what was classed as dangerous ground to apply a tourniquet to both his legs and inject morphine.

‘Unfortunately, two paces up a hill he hit the device and that was it.

‘In my mind I think he thought he would make it, and if the shoe was on the other foot I know the other guys around him would have done the same.

‘Every doctor we’ve talked to said Scott would have died if Martin had not done what he did and applied the tourniquets.’

Mrs Bell said the Queen hailed Pte Bell, of Bradford, West Yorkshire, as a ‘very, very brave man’.

‘It was absolutely amazing, it was fantastic,’ she said. ‘We were all so nervous, but she just puts you at ease.

‘Obviously we received it on behalf of Martin and all the lads in the Parachute Regiment - in fact all our heroes out there - but to receive it was absolutely fantastic.

‘They were like his brothers and he would never have left his brothers.’

Private Bell died on the morning of January 25 last year near the village of Spoor Kalay in the Nahr-e Saraj district of Helmand Province (file picture of fighting in the province)

Private Bell died on the morning of January 25 last year near the village of Spoor Kalay in the Nahr-e Saraj district of Helmand Province.

He and his comrades were on a perilous mission to retrieve equipment dropped by a soldier caught in a blast earlier so it did not fall into enemy hands.

Suddenly Pte Meenagh triggered a devastating booby-trap bomb, blowing off both his legs.

Despite direct orders not to attempt to reach the severely-wounded victim, Pte Bell defied his commander.

He ran across ground seeded with IEDs to his stricken colleague, applied tourniquets to stop him bleeding and adminstered the painkiller morphine.

Inspiring his fellow soldiers, Pte Bell grabbed the stretcher and helped carry the injured Para to the evacuation point.

But as he dragged the stretcher up a steep bank he himself stepped on an IED - suffering fatal injuries.

His remarkable heroism meant Pte Meenagh was rescued and airlifted from the battlefield before being flown back to the UK. He is currently recovering.

Pte Bell’s citation made clear that the incident leading to his untimely death was not ‘an isolated act of courage... it was not the first time Bell’s valour had saved lives’.
