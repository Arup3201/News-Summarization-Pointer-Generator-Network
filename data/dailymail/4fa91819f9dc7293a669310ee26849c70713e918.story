The inter-caste marriage of Divya (left) and Ilavarasan (right) sparked riots in Dharmapuri and was blamed for her father's suicide

The family of a low caste man, who was found dead on the side of a railway track, say he was murdered for daring to marry a woman from a higher social group.

Ilavarasan, 23, part of the Dalit community, formally known as Untouchables, and Divya, 20, a higher caste Vanniyar, sparked riots in Tamil Nadu last year when they married in secret.

Her father committed suicide over her refusal to end the marriage and 300 Dalit homes were torched in retribution.

Ilavarasan was found dead two weeks ago with a serious head wound, a day after Divya said she had ended the marriage.

Local authorities believe he committed suicide but his family insist he was murdered and say he has become a martyr for the Dalit community.

Their story sparked intense media interest in India and triggered heated debate on inter-caste marriage and anti-Dalit violence.

While inter-caste marriages are increasingly common in India, they are still frowned upon in some, particularly rural, areas.

Women who marry 'down' a caste also face greater social stigma as they are responsible for protecting the family honour.

Hundreds of people attended Ilavarasan's funeral on Sunday, despite a court order prohibiting anyone but family members.

However, Divya did not attend.

Ilavarasan's family now plan to turn his burial site at his native village of Natham into a memorial with a library.

His father Llango toldÂ NDTV: 'Inter-caste couples can come here to take inspiration from Ilavarasan.'

The couple hit the headlines in November
 last year after Divya's father committed suicide when she refused to 
leave her new husband.

Ilavarasan died two weeks ago and his family believe he was murdered for marrying a higher caste woman

Three hundred homes in the Dalit communities of Natham, Anna Nagar and Konampatt were torched during a riot and families said they lost all their belongings and savings in the violence.

The Times of India reported that Divya, who is studying to become a nurse, announced she had separated from Ilavarasan on July 1 because she was haunted by the death of her father.

According to the newspaper she said she would stay with her mother 'for the time being' but within days her husband was found dead.

A post-mortem revealed he died of a head injury but Ilavarasan's parents demanded a second autopsy.

The results are due to be announced at the Madras High Court this week.
