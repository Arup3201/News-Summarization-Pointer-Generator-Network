Tottenham winger Nacer Chadli has got his kit off for Cosmopolitan magazine to raise awareness of male cancer for Cancer Research UK.

Chadli, posing with nothing but a towel, has gone some way to proving he's in good shape both on and off the pitch, as he shows of his rippling physique which the Belgian claims he is 'pretty happy with'.

The 26-year-old has been one of Mauricio Pochettino's star players so far this season, scoring five Premier League goals with the latest coming in Tottenham's late comeback against Aston Villa on Sunday.

Spurs were 1-0 down with just over five minutes remaining at Villa Park before Chadli low finish sparked the Tottenham revival which saw Harry Kane grab a late winner for the north London club. 

Speaking to Cosmopolitan, Chadli claimed he hopes his naked snap will get people talking about an important cause.

He said: 'As a footballer, my body’s my tool – so I have to take care of it, and I’m pretty happy with the way I look and what my body is capable of – sometimes I’d like more muscle or bigger legs, but you can never be perfect. My weakness is definitely chocolate – Belgian obviously.

'I’ve never posed naked before, but I’m not nervous – maybe I should wait and see what the reaction’s like!

'It’s an important cause – cancer affects lots of families, so I hope it gets people talking.'

On the pitch, Chadli has backed Kane for a senior England call-up despite admitting he had never heard of the young striker before joining Tottenham.

Kane's free-kick winner at Villa on Sunday was his seventh goal in his last seven games and eighth of the season.

He has nine England Under-21 caps and six goals after helping Gareth Southgate's side to Euro 2015 last month.

Roy Hodgson's senior side host Slovenia in a Euro 2016 qualifier before a friendly in Scotland in two weeks and Chadli believes his team-mate deserves a call-up.

He said: 'Why not? It is up to him and the manager of the national team. He has a lot of quality and he can have some impact in the game.

'He practises a lot of free kicks like that in training. He has a great shot and he still practises it. That is good, he is a young talented player. I am very happy for him and pleased for him that he made an impact.'
