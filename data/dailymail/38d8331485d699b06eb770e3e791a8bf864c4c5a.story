He suffered a very public humiliation when his apology over tuition fees was turned into a spoof video that went viral.

And it seems Nick Clegg was hoping for a greater success from this keynote address by incorporating the moves of someone a little more popular, namely Korean pop star Psy.

Speaking yesterday at the Lib Dem party conference in Brighton the Deputy Prime Minister seemed to be doing his own version of the popular Gangnam style dance routine.

Taking the reins: Nick Clegg looked like Korean singer Psy as he made his keynote conference speech in Brighton

He was caught by photographers gesturing at the ceiling with both arms and crossing both hands in front of him in a remarkably similar fashion to the pop star in his distinctive ‘horsey style’ dance.

Mr Clegg isn’t the first to imitate the 
South Korean pop star’s moves – Hugh Jackman, Heidi Klum, Britney Spears
and Madonna have already recorded their own versions of the dance.

His flamboyant body language might have been an attempt to act out his latest metaphor for David Cameron and the Conservative party - which he compared to a ‘broken shopping trolley’ that keeps veering to the right.

Buoyed with confidence following his party’s victory in the Eastleigh by-election, he gave a rousing speech to members at the Liberal Democrat Spring conference.

Giddy up: Nick Clegg was confident following the success at the Eastleigh by-election and seemed to mimic the Gangnam style dance during his speech

Despite woeful poll ratings yesterday 
suggesting the party could lose half its seats in a General Election, he
insisted the Liberal Democrats had proved they were no longer a party 
of protest.

The Lib Dem 
leader told a rapturous audience in Brighton they were ‘no longer the 
none-of-the-above choice...we are a party that is for things, not simply
against things’.

And he 
spelled out what he was against by turning his fire on his Coalition 
partners, saying it was the Liberal Democrats who kept the Government 
‘anchored in the centre ground’.

‘The Conservatives, on their own, will never deliver the fairer society - it’s just not who they are’, he said.

‘The
Conservative party knows it needs to stay on the centre ground to have 
any chance of speaking to ordinary people’s concerns. At least the 
leadership seem to.

‘But 
they just can’t manage it no matter how hard they try. They’re like a 
kind of broken shopping trolley. Every time you try and push them 
straight ahead they veer off to the right hand side.’

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg called for unity in the party as he appeared to imitate solo singer Psy

He also tried to play down tensions within his party on austerity, particularly with Mr Cable, who did not address the conference and was relegated to fringe events.

The unity of the Liberal Democrats is ‘what our enemies most fear’, Mr Clegg said. ‘No one will know what we stand for unless we stand together’.

He told activists:’Get back out there. Tell our side of the story. And we will win again. On the doorstep, in town halls, in Government. Keep fighting for what we believe in. Keeping winning’.
