Vice President Biden apologized on Wednesday for  describing predatory bankers who loan money to U.S. troops as 'Shylocks' in a speech the day before, calling it a 'poor choice of words.'

The term, which derives from the name of a vicious money-lending character in Shakespeare's 'The Merchant of Venice', is considered anti-Semitic, and Biden had been criticized on Tuesday by the National Director of the Anti-Defamation League, Abraham Foxman, for his comment.

Foxman said Biden 'should have been more careful' when speaking at a conference marking the 40th anniversary of the Legal Services Corporation.

'When someone as friendly to the Jewish community and open and tolerant an individual as is Vice President Joe Biden, uses the term "Shylocked" to describe unscrupulous moneylenders dealing with service men and women, we see once again how deeply embedded this stereotype about Jews is in society,' Foxman said.

In a statement provided to Business Insider on Wednesday, Biden described Foxman as a longtime 'friend and advisor' and said he agreed with his assessment.

'He’s correct, it was a poor choice of words, particularly as he said coming from "someone as friendly to the Jewish community and open and tolerant an individual as is Vice President Joe Biden."

'He’s right,' Biden said. 

Biden had been praising the Legal Services Corporation during the Washington speech - a group which provides lawyers to people who could not otherwise afford them - during the otherwise rudimentary speech on Tuesday when he made the offending remark.

Recounting how people would speak to his son, Beau, about financial and legal difficulties when he was serving in Iraq, Biden said: 'People would come to him and talk about what was happening to them at home in terms of foreclosures, in terms of bad loans that were being... I mean these Shylocks who took advantage of these women and men while overseas.'

Shylock was the antagonist in Shakespeare's c.1596 play 'The Merchant of Venice', a romantic comedy centred around the merchant Antonio, but of which Shylock is by far the most famous and memorable character.

He was a Jewish money lender, and the villainous nature of his character has raised questions as to whether Shakespeare held anti-Semitic views. Shylock is defeated at the end of the play, and forced to convert to Christianity.

The word came to represent a negative stereotype of Jewish people as heartless or demanding creditors.

Shylock, 'The Merchant of Venice's' chief villain, is one of the most hated characters in all of Shakespeare's plays, and his name came to be associated with negative stereotypes of Jewish people.

In the play, Shylock memorable demands a 'pound of flesh' from the merchant Antonio if he does not repay a loan.

Bidenmay have made yet another offensive comment on Wednesday when he stated at an event in Iowa that a politician from Singapore was the 'wisest man in the Orient.

The Vice President is known for making race-related slip-ups, having described Barack Obama in 2007 as 'the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy,''

And while talking about his home state of Delaware in 2006, he said: 'You cannot go to a 7-11 or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. I'm not joking.'
