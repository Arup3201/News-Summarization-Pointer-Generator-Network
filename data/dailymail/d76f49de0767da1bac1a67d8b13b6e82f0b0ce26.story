ITV political editor Tom Bradby has reason to question the spelling ability of American Twitter users after his feed on the  site was swamped with abuse by people who'd confused him with NFL star Tom Brady, who's at the center of  so-called 'deflategate'.

New England Patriots star Brady is busy deflecting allegations that his team used deliberately deflated balls to gain an advantage over the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday, who they beat to win a place in the Super Bowl.

Thousands have taken to Twitter to voice their opinion about the matter, but many have tweeted abuse at ITV's presenter instead of the NFL star, who isn't on the social media site.

Bradby was inundated to the extend that he felt the need to publicly address the issue and ponder whether he should write to Brady to tell him to sign up to Twitter.

He wrote on Facebook on Thursday 'how many Americans can't spell?' and then pasted hundreds of messages below directed at him by NFL fans.

He added: 'This is my timeline on Twitter this morning. Or, to be more accurate, just a part of it. It goes on and on and on, pages and pages and pages of it. Something to do with deflated balls apparently...

'I am considering two courses of action - writing to Tom Brady, star quarterback of the Patriots, to ask him to please get onto Twitter so I don't have to read all the abuse meant for him any more or sponsoring a new American spelling bee. Feel free to tell me which you would recommend.'

Brady became implicated in the scandal when New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick told the media they should address comments they have about the footballs to Brady.

'I think we all know that quarterbacks, kickers, specialists have certain preferences on footballs. They know a lot more about it than I do. They're a lot more sensitive to it than I am,' he explained.

'I hear them comment on it from time to time, but I can tell you and they will tell you that there is never any sympathy whatsoever from me on that subject. Zero. Tom's personal preferences on his footballs is something he can talk about in much better detail and information than I can possibly provide.'

If, for any reason, anyone on the Patriots is found to have anything to do with Sunday's underinflated balls, they would face up to a $25,000 fine

On Thursday Brady and Patriots Belichick both appeared on nationally televised press conferences to rebut the claims as the controversy swirling around America's biggest sporting event reached fever pitch.

NFL chiefs are probing allegations that balls used by the Patriots offense in their 45-7 rout of the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday were inflated below standard league levels - giving Brady and his team-mates an advantage by making them easier to handle.   

But Brady, one of the scandal-tainted NFL's biggest stars, flatly denied any involvement in the scandal dubbed 'deflategate.'

'I didn't alter the balls in any way,' said Brady, who is preparing for a record sixth Super Bowl in Arizona on February 1.

'I feel like I have always played within the rules. I would never break the rules,' added Brady, a three-time Super Bowl winner and two-time NFL Most Valuable Player.

Brady's comments echoed those made earlier in the day by Belichick, who said he was 'shocked' to learn of the possibly illegal footballs on Monday.

'I have never talked to any player, staff member about football air pressure,' Belichick said.

'To me, the footballs are approved by the league and game officials pre-game, and we play with what's out there.' 

Brady had originally laughed off the suggestion of wrongdoing by the Patriots in a radio appearance on Monday, thinking it was 'sour grapes.'

By Thursday, the 37-year-old superstar was aware of the magnitude of the issue.

'It's very serious,' Brady said. 'Obviously, integrity of the sport is very important.'

However, he added that he believed he and the Patriots would get through it.

'Things are going to be fine,' he said. 'This isn't ISIS. No one's dying,' he said, referring to the militant group waging war in Iraq and Syria.

Although the league has given no timetable for announcing its findings, they have reportedly found that 11 of 12 balls provided by the Patriots for the game did not meet league standards.

Brady said he had yet to be contacted by league officials about the issue, which seems certain to cloud the build up to the Super Bowl in Phoenix, Arizona.

The title game and its attendant halftime show draw millions of viewers, with television advertisers paying as much as $4 million a slot to reach the massive audience.

Brady, who also regularly appears in celebrity news magazines due to his marriage to Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bundchen, admitted the controversy had soured his preparations for the Super Bowl.

'It's disappointing that a situation like this happens,' Brady said. 'Obviously I would love to be up here in a very joyful mood. These are the best two weeks of the year if you happen to be one of the two teams still playing.' 

The whiff of scandal could be especially damaging for the Patriots, who have been sanctioned for infractions in the past.

Belichick was fined $500,000 and the team docked $250,000 over the 2007 'spygate' affair, in which the NFL found they illegally filmed another team's hand signals during a game.

If the NFL does find the Patriots purposely under-inflated the balls, they could be subject to fines and the loss of draft picks.

As for the Super Bowl, Brady said he believes whatever the outcome of the league's probe, his team belongs there.

'I feel like we won the game fair and square,' he said.

The controversy comes at the end of an NFL season dogged by lurid headlines over domestic violence scandals, with Baltimore Ravens star Ray Rice kicked out of the sport after video emerged of him punching his future wife unconscious in an elevator.

Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson also saw his season cut short when he was suspended for severely whipping his four-year-old son with a tree branch.
