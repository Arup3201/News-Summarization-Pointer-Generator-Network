A South Florida woman was fatally crushed during a boating accident this weekend in which her vessel got caught in the current near one of the bridges connecting Miami to Miami Beach.

Authorities say that Janette Africano, 35, of Hialeah was pronounced dead at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami after a valiant effort to revive her that included the administration of nearly 45 minutes of CPR.

Africano was motoring south on Saturday  around 5 p.m. with a male companion in an 18-foot red-and-white boat through the Intra-coastal Waterway that separates Miami, proper, from the South Beach area of Miami Beach, according to various media outlets.

Motoring: Janette Africano and a male companion identified as her husband were headed south through the body of water separating Miami from Miami Beach

Reversing course: The couple turned back north in their 18-foot vessel after they encountered a cruise ship making a turn ahead of them in the waterway

PortMiami: The couple reportedly came upon the cruise ship after approaching PortMiami, one of the busiest cruise ship ports in the U.S.

Africano and the man - who is as-yet unnamed - encountered a cruise ship as they approached the General Douglas MacArthur Causeway, according to The Miami Herald.

At that point, the couple reversed course and headed back north, or until they were apparently caught in the waterway's currents and maneuvered dangerously close to the causeway's pilings.

'We don’t know why the boat stopped underneath the MacArthur Causeway,'   Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission spokesman Jorge Pino told CBS Miami.

A long span: The MacArthur Causeway is a lengthy bridge that runs over the Biscayne Bay, connecting Miami with Miami Beach

Caught in the current: The couple's boat was apparently forced toward one of the causeway's pilings by the bay's rough waters

'But we do have some info the female that was on board the vessel was trying to push off from the bridge and at some point she became stuck between the bridge and the vessel.'

'We're looking into whether carelessness played a role, recklessness played a role, alcohol played a role,' Pino said.

The official reportedly added that somehow Africano, 'ended up being crushed by the vessel and the bridge.'

Meanwhile, a family friend told CBS Miami that Africano had been boating with her husband, although The Miami Herald identified the man as her boyfriend.

Official account: Jorge Pino of the FWCC says Africano somehow got stuck between her boat and the piling as she tried to shove the vessel off, into the bay

'He did everything he could but unfortunately it just didn’t work out,' Pino told the TV station.

The Coast Guard escorted the boat to Watson Island where paramedics tried to revive Africano.

But despite the ministrations, Africano, 'never moved,” reportedly said Jean Cadet who saw the rescue efforts.

'I’ve seen many accidents here in my career with the FWC, but this is certainly something unusual,' Pino told CBS Miami, adding, 'We want to get to the bottom of it and find out and learn from this accident maybe this will never have to happen again.'
