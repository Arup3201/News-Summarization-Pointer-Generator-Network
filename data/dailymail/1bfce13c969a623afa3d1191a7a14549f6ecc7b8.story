Penelope's Instagram feed is written as if it's straight from her snout and reveals her unique piggy point of view, accompanied by surprisingly artistic shots of the pig enjoying daily life.

The purebred Juliana pig is potty trained, performs tricks, and loves being dressed up by her human friends.

Penelope's owner said: 'She has been dressed up and had her nails painted since she was a baby, so she doesn't mind wearing outfits and posing for pictures. She is very patient.

Penelope apparently doesn't mind having her nails painting or being dressed up for the camera

Penelope likes the headbands with flowers and bows the most, as they aren't restrictive

She has been getting her nails painted since a young age and now is used to it

'She actually enjoys the photo shoots, since she gets treats - she likes the headbands with flowers and bows the most, as they aren't restrictive, but she also likes a warm, cosy sweater when it's cold outside.

'My teenage son and daughter came up with the idea to make an Instagram account during Christmas break. It was their project, and thought it might be fun to show other people how cute she was with her routines and outfits and sweet personality.

She may be a pig but she's still a little angle, according to Penelope's owners

'We never thought she would have such
 a tremendous following - 43,000 people from all over the world love our
 sweet little piggy.'

The fury fashionista not only loves wearing hair-bands and sweatshirts but is also often snapped wearing animal disguises -- bumblebee and bunny being amongst them.

As
 one of the most famous pigs on the planet, Penelope is helping to break
 worldwide perceptions of her breed. Who says pigs can't be stylish? 
Certainly not Penelope!
