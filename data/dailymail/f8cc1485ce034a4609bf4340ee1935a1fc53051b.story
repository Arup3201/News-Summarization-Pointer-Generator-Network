The effects of zero gravity on our muscles, bones and joints have been extensively studied.

But while living in space is known to weaken our immune system, no one is sure how our cells are affected in the long-term by prolonged exposure to a weightless environment.

Now a new ISS experiment will seek to answer that very question, and it could provide us with important information on the risk of spaceflight to astronauts.

An ISS experiment known as the Cellbox Mission will test how Phagocytes (pictured), cells that are important to our immune system, are impaired by being in a zero gravity environment

Known as the Cellbox Mission, the experiment was carried to the International Space Station (ISS) by SpaceX’s Dragon capsule, which berthed with the station yesterday.

It will be run by a team from the University of Zurich’s Institute of Anatomy, led by Professor Oliver Ullrich.

The experiment contains a cargo of immune cells.

In zero gravity, various immune system functions are known to be impaired.

In particular phagocytes, cells that protect our body from harmful foreign bodies, are unable to work properly.

The unmanned Dragon capsule from the private US firm SpaceX successfully reached the International Space Station yesterday.

It is the third scheduled cargo mission for the capsule to the ISS, known as CRS-3, and its fourth visit in total.

The capsule has delivered 2.2 tons of cargo including food and 150 experiments to the astronauts on board.

It will spend several weeks attached to the station before returning to Earth with finished experiments and waste.

They can't reliably protect astronauts from infections, which is why even minor contamination can be a problem.

Professor Ullrich will be studying the structure and metabolism of these phagocytes while they are on the ISS.

Over three days, they will be studied to determine if zero gravity has any lasting effects on these important cells.

The researchers want to know whether, when astronauts ultimately return to Earth, their immune systems are irrevocably damaged from the trip to space.

Previous experiments with limited zero gravity, including parabolic aircraft flights and research rockets, have shown that cells respond to the absence of gravity within seconds.

Key molecular functions for cell-to-cell communication and cell migration are immediately impaired.

‘Conducting research on the ISS is as if – after studying many trees one by one – you climb a mountain to see the whole forest,’ Professor Ullrich explains in a release.

The experiment is not only delving into modern human biology, however.

The team will also be hoping to discover if certain conditions, such as having gravity, are crucial for the development of complex multicellular life.

This could provide information on whether Earth is the ideal place for life evolve or if, even in space, cells can adapt to their environment.

‘Conducting research in space enables us to understand life on Earth better,’ explains Professor Ullrich.

But, if nothing else, the Cellbox Mission will provide key data to gauge the risk to astronauts on future spaceflights.
