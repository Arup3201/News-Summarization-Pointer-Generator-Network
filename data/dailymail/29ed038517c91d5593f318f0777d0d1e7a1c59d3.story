Clad in black from head to toe and carrying a formidable assortment of gear, Ken Andre, a 35-year-old father of two, is every criminal's worst nightmare.

The Weymouth doorman is one of the UK's only ninja warriors and is regularly to be found prowling the streets of his home town, putting himself between the nastier elements of society and everyone else.

Mr Andre, a former soldier who goes by the ninja name 'Shadow' has been practising martial arts for more than 25 years. He says he loves being a ninja so much, he'll never give it up - regardless of what critics might say.

'They [critics] are entitled to their own 
perceptions and opinions,' he told MailOnline in an exclusive interview.

'This is my destiny and this is who I am. If I 
can give people inspiration and a bit of a message about living your life the way that's right for you, then I'm grateful to 
carry on.

'At the end of the day, I'm out there doing something unique 
and I'm happy and content.'

One group who might not be quite so pleased is the Weymouth criminal fraternity who have to keep a weather eye out for Mr Andre as well as for the police.

But although he has been known to intervene in fights, Mr Andre says most of his work involves talking to people in need of a sympathetic ear on the Weymouth clifftops and adds that if a situation appears too dangerous, he calls the police.Â 

'A lot of time, I come across people who 
are depressed or lost,' he explains. 'Back in 
the day, I used to deal with violence or drug dealing.

Skills: Along with fighting ability, ninjas traditionally had to be physically fit and intelligent

'It's like second nature 
to me now. I give first aid if it's needed, call the police if they're required and if someone is 
vulnerable, then I will step in and defend them.

'The last person I met was 
going to jump off a cliff so I shared some wisdom and knowledge with him
 and gave him my time.

'Sometimes that's all they need. I try and be 
loving in that situation and be the best I can be.'

Mr Andre's martial arts career began at the age of eight, when a traumatic childhood event inspired him to learn self-defence.

'I've been a ninja for more than 24 years now,' he explains. 'When I was eight, I witnessed my mum being beaten up one night and I vowed from that moment to become a weapon and never a allow myself or my family to be touched again.'

Later, he joined the army and spent 11 years in the forces, honing his already formidable fighting skills.

'I learned all about martial arts [in the army],' he says. 'I wanted to be so strong and powerful. I wanted to be a ninja master and learn how to overcome my physical limitations.'

Now according to Mr Andre, his ninja skills have become second nature to him whether creeping undetected through the shadows or reading the wind.

'It's a consciousness now,' he adds. 'When I go out in the shadows, I know how to read the wind, the omens - it is a skill and it's inspiring. It's like a patrol, a ninja walk. I go out to meditate and use my skills.'

Important: Mr Andre says many of the people who he meets are suicidal and just need a sympathetic shoulder

And, says Mr Andre, his family are happy to get involved too. 'My family are used to me now,' he chuckles.

'My mum even
started trying to develop the skills herself, although I think they are quite surprised that I'm still doing it [being a ninja] after all these years.'

Shocked or not, Mr Andre says they can expect his crime-fighting career to continue. 'I can't stop - it's the essence of who I am,' he explains.

'Some people think I might have been a ninja in a past life. Either way, it's who I am and I'll never stop.'
