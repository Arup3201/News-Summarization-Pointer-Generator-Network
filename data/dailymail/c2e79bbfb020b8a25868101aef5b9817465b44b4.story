A jealous husband was jailed for life today for murdering his 'Shirley Valentine' wife over her holiday romance.

Mother-of-four Assia Newton, 44, was strangled by her furious husband Kelvin, 45, for falling in love with a waiter on a Mediterranean holiday.

After years trapped in an unhappy marriage, she told her builder husband that she wanted a divorce – and had met a new man in Tunisia.

Mrs Newton was due to fly out to meet the waiter for a third holiday in two months when Newton strangled her with a dog lead in the bedroom of the family home.

The couple’s three daughters looked down on their father from the public gallery as he was jailed for life with a recommendation that he serve a minimum of 18 years.

Youngest daughter Sameera, 17, said: ‘‘Mum joked she was like Shirley Valentine and told dad about the waiter after the second holiday.’

Victim: Assia Newton poses for a happy family portrait with her three daughters. Mrs Newton's smiles belied the fact that her home life with her husband was a continuous series of arguments and violent rows

The daughters told police how their father had ‘changed’ after being told about Mrs Newton’s new relationship with a waiter called Mohammed.

Cardiff Crown Court heard that Mrs Newton visited Tunisia for the first time in June last year after going on holiday with her daughter Sophia to celebrate the girl's 18th birthday.

Mrs Newton returned to Tunisia alone a fortnight later and began a long-distance relationship with daily calls to Mohammed over the internet.

She was days away from taking her third holiday to meet her new love when Newton strangled her with a dog lead.

Eldest daughter Charmaine, 23, said that her mother was ‘happy’ someone was being kind to her after suffering years of violence in her 23-year marriage.

She said her father had been ‘violent, controlling and jealous’ throughout the marriage.

Charmaine added that her mother had begun to ‘stand up for herself’ in the months before her death.

Newton, of Bridgend, denied murder but was found guilty by a jury after a two-week trial.

Her Honour Judge Eleri Rees told him: ‘This was murder borne out of your sexual jealousy and the knowledge that Assia intended to leave you for good.

‘Assia told friends that there was no sexual relationship but she believed it could develop into one.‘She even had the courage to tell you about the relationship.

‘But it is clear you didn’t take the news calmly and did not accept the marriage was over.’

Judge Rees said: ‘‘Assia will never see her daughters marry and become mothers themselves. No sentence I can pass will heal the pain and anguish they feel.’

She sentenced Newton to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 18 years before he can be considered for release.
