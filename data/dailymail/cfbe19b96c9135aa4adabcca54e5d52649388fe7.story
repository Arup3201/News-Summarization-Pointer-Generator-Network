A council raked in £1.6million in parking fines from just ten roads - and nearly a quarter of them came from one street.

Redbridge Council handed out 8,964 tickets in Cranbrook Road and raised £393,000 in fines, according to figures for last year released by the local authority.

Their second most profitable street - Clements Road - earned the council £251,000 from 4,600 parking fines - despite the street being just 540 yards long.

One resident said: 'I want the council to stop harassing drivers and issuing tickets just to make money.'

The third most ticketed street was Chadwick Road where people were caught parking illegally 3,970 times - bringing in £176,000.

Council workers issued 3,738 
£60-flat-rate Penalty Charge Notices on cars parked on George Lane making £163,000, 
while Station Road in Ilford saw 4,015 tickets being handed out.

As fines increase with non or 
late-payment, the amount of money earned by a road is not always 
proportional to the number of tickets issued.

Local business manager Shujaa Latif said: 'It definitely makes a difference because people can't park up and come in.

'It's an issue, there are yellow lines everywhere. It is also very expensive for people to park up locally.'

Mohammed Butt, 50, said he pulled over for just a few seconds in the area and was hit with a fine.

'I just want the council to stop harassing drivers and issuing tickets just to make money. Businesses in the area are suffering because of this,' he said.

The Conservative-controlled council 
generously lowered parking charges to 30p per half hour during the 
Christmas period, but residents are still complaining about mobile 
parking enforcement vehicles which arbitrarily issue tickets.

A spokesperson for Redbridge Council said: 'We understand that nobody wants to receive a parking fine, but these restrictions are there for a reason.

'If residents feel they have received a parking ticket incorrectly then they can appeal through the regulated process described on the back of the ticket.'
