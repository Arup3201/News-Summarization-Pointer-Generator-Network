These despicable images show four men about to be put to death by ISIS in Iraq, apparently because they are spies.  

The shocking pictures emerged just hours after campaign group CAGE defended Jihadi John, today unmasked as west London student Mohammed Emwazi, as 'beautiful' and a man who 'wouldn't hurt a fly'.

The scarcely believable comments about Emwazi were made by CAGE leader Asim Qureshi at a press conference in which he blamed MI5 for radicalising the University of Westminster graduate.

The victims are blindfolded and lined up ready to be shot by Islamic State fighters in the horrific images

The alleged spies, clearly terrified, are marched to their deaths under the murderous eyes of their killers

In the guise of Jihadi John, Emwazi has apparently been responsible for the beheadings of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, British aid worker David Haines and taxi driver Alan Henning, and American aid worker Abdul-Rahman Kassig, also known as Peter.

The gruesome murders were filmed, expertly edited and distributed in the name of Islamic State.

Jihadi John's trademark black hood can be seen covering the faces of the four executioners in the latest pictures, thought to have been taken in Salahuddin province in Iraq.

Each man was accused of being part of a spy ring and were executed under the crime of spying for the Baghdad government.

Clad in the familiar orange jumpsuits the victims, named as Sabi Khalif Mohammad al-Taghi, Mohammad Mahdi Salah al-Jamili, Abdullah Mahmoud Abdullah al-Khamili and Salwan Saidy Suleiman al-Jabouri, are pictured being marched into a clearing under the dark gaze of their killers.

Amid bright sunlight filtered through surrounding trees, they are photographed standing separately while their three alleged accomplices kneel with their heads down in the background.

Suleiman al-Jabouri fixes the camera with a defiant gaze, moments before he is apparently shot and killed

Some of their faces show defiance and others fear, before they are lined up on their knees with their black-clad killers standing behind. 

In gut-wrenching images the four are then seen slumped on the ground, apparently having been shot in cold blood, as their ISIS murderers raise hand guns in the air. 

Blood pools around the heads of the dead men, which are shown in close-up in images too horrific to reproduce. 

Earlier today Qureshi was branded an ISIS sympathiser as he appeared to launch a defence of Emwazi and his barbaric crimes.

He described Emwazi as 'the most humble young person that I knew', adding: 'He was such a beautiful young man, really. 

'It's hard to imagine the trajectory, but it is not a trajectory that's unfamiliar with us.

'When are we going to finally learn that when we treat people as if they're outsiders, they are going to feel like outsiders and they will look for belonging elsewhere.'

The four, including Abdullah Mahmoud Abdullah al-Khamili, were killed because they were allegedly spies

He also revealed that he'd been in regular contact with Emwazi before he left for Syria. 

In the wake of Emwazi's unmasking as the world's most wanted man, CAGE yesterday released a statement entitled 'Jihadi John: 'Radicalised' By Britain'.

The release stated that Emwazi 'desperately wanted to use the system to change his situation, but the system ultimately rejected him,' a view later echoed on CAGE's press conference, which was broadcast live on both BBC and Sky News.

Qureshi then used the statement to criticise the British security services, arguing that counter-terror measures turned young Muslims into extremists.

Other videos have emerged of Qureshi suggesting he is a jihadi apologist, including oneat an anti-US rally in London at which he is filmed urging protesters to 'support the jihad of our brothers and sisters' in Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine and Chechnya. 

Qureshi can be seen speaking through a microphone at the the pan-Islamic Hizb ut-Tahrir movement rally.

He says: 'When we see the example of our brothers and sisters fighting in Chechnya, Iraq, Palestine, Kashmir, Afghanistan, then we know where the example lies.

'When we see Hezbollah defeating the armies of Israel, we know where the solution is and where the victory lies.

'We know that it is incumbent upon all of us, to support the Jihad of our brothers and sisters in these countries when they are facing the oppression of the West.

'Allahu Akhbar! Allahu Akhbar! (God is great, God is great!)'

Qureshi stands alone on a stage in the 54 second clip, shot at the height of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars in 2006.

And in a second video, in which Qureshi is quizzed by Juliane Assange on his view of Sharia law, in particularl stoning, he said: 'I agree with Islamic concepts of how we practice our punishments.'

Asked if he believes in the use of the death penalty, he added: 'From an Islamic perspective, yes. As long as all the due process elements are met.'
