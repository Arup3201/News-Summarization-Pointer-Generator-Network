The lover of a serial con artist who posed as a playboy Italian aristocrat has admitted how she helped him by collecting cash from one of his victims.

Gail Heyworth, 51, lived a life of luxury thanks to the lies of Scott Travis despite claiming she was also one of his victims.

However, she was found to be the person collecting cash from one of his victims when another woman came forward after being duped out of nearly £12,000 by Travis.

Travis is currently serving an eight-year prison sentence for blackmail and fraud. However, his latest conviction revealed that he conned a Muslim woman looking for a religious marriage after meeting her on a dating website.

Fraud: Travis posed as a 'well-heeled bachelor' on the Single Muslim dating website to reel in his victim

The 45-year-old fraudster, who lived 
with Heyworth in a council flat in Heywood, Rochdale, posed as a 
'well-heeled bachelor' on SingleMuslim.com called Mohammed Kashif Rai who was looking for a bride.

He met a 25-year-old woman online and reeled her in with lies about extensive financial interests and property portfolio before concocting a sob story to ask for cash.

His partner Gail Heyworth, 51, then met the victim several times, posing as a family friend to collect the money.

Travis wooed the the woman via text and email - but made sure he never physically met her or his cover would be blown.

The couple would travel to locations in Manchester such as the Trafford Centre and Cheetham Hill where Heyworth would accept wads of cash in an envelope on behalf of her man.

Form: The court heard how conman Scott Travis has a history of fraudulent activity

Heyworth, of Baguley Crescent, Middleton, admitted fraud by false representation at Manchester Crown Court yesterday on the day her trial was due to begin.

Travis is currently serving 
eight years in jail for a separate fraud after posing as an Italian aristocrat to dupe an 
82-year-old man out of £100,000.

He women and the 
elderly out of cash by falsely claiming he was Viscount Franco Dibella 
III and that he stood to inherit a £1.7m fortune.

His charades had led to a huge 
spending spree in which he acquired a £50,000 Lexus car, had cosmetic 
surgery and he stayed for six weeks in a four star £200-a-night hotel and enjoyed weekends away in Monte Carlo .

He also employed his own chauffeur, 
drank bottles of £80 Bollinger champagne and splashed on suits and 
shirts from designer boutiques and dined out at exclusive restaurants.

Manchester Crown Court was told that when he was younger, Travis was told his mother was actually his sister because she was only 15 when he was born.

He was brought up in a humble council house to a working class family in Rochdale.

Formerly known as Paul Marsden he 
changed his name by deed poll to Scott Travis and embarked on a series 
of frauds by assuming up to four fake identities and made up tall tales 
of how he used to play drums with rock band Whitesnake.

He falsely alleged the US rock band owed him huge sums in royalties for songs he had written.

He showed friends a big box of songs 
he claimed to have written sold to the supergroup and sent his family 
tickets whenever they played gigs - although he never appeared on stage.

In one scam Travis befriended an 
82-year old man then duped him out of his £100,000 life savings over a 
period of seven years by falsely claiming he needed money for cancer 
treatment at a specialist centre in Lucca, Italy plus cash to pay off 
gangsters who had been terrorising him into paying off loans.

Reality: Scott Ravis and Gail Heyworth were actually living together in this council flat in Heywood, Rochdale

Police discovered he had a long history of identity fraud during which he obtain credit cards, loans and mobile phones in other people's names to rip off a string of victims.

His long-term lover Heyworth had claimed at the 
time she was 'sickened' by his offences but has now admitted she was 
actually helping him commit the lonely-hearts crime.

Travis admitted fraud by false representation at an earlier hearing, and the pair will be sentenced together at a later date.

Accomplice: Gail Heyworth had previously claimed she was sickened by Travis' fraud but police discovered she had helped him dupe a Muslim woman out of nearly £12,000

Lisa Boocock, prosecuting, said: 'Mr Travis has a very long history of fraud and fraudulent behaviour.'

'Gail Heyworth, knowing his background 
and knowing he had been arrested for fraud matters in January, then 
became aware that he was contacting, through the ‘Single Muslim’ 
website, single young women looking for a religious match, and was posing as Mohammed Kashif Rai, who was very well-heeled and had a lot of financial interests and many properties.

'Gail Heyworth, knowing that, then travelled in a vehicle with Mr Travis in order to screen him from the lady in question because his appearance was not that which he described, adopting a ruse of being a family friend.

'She met the woman on two occasions and took envelopes of cash from her, knowing it was part of the fraud. It’s these two journeys that go essentially beyond mere knowledge.'

In 2005 Travis was first exposed as a
liar and jailed for 16 months when he applied for a £7,500 loan and 
secured it against Heyworth's flat - using her details and even imitated
a woman's voice when he spoke to brokers from the company.

He also stole a winter heating cheque
from the 67-year old father of hospital administrator Heyworth and used
the details to obtain three credit cards and several mobile phones in 
his name.

In another scam he pretended to be 
the manager of a computer firm earning £35,000 per year whilst claiming 
state benefits under another false name.

He also made an application for a 
time-share at a country club in Lancaster under the name Giofranco 
Dibella and claiming to be a writer.

A taxi driver who fell victim to 
Travis after he hired him as a chauffeur only to owe him £1,265 said: 'I
fell hook, line and sinker for the lies told by him. His stories were 
so good, anybody would have believed them. I felt used, abused and 
foolish.'

Judge Richard Mansell QC adjourned the case for the preparation of pre-sentence and psychiatric reports.
