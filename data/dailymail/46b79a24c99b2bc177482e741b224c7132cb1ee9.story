Speaking out: Kirstie Trup has told for the first time of the terrifying moment she was doused in acid by two strangers

A teenager who had acid thrown at her by a stranger on a moped in Zanzibar has been told she cannot sit in the sun for at least 12 months.

Kirstie Trup, 18, who had skin grafts on her face, arm and shoulder, conceded that it was a 'small price to pay' following the attack in which her friend, Katie Gee, was also injured.

The pair were helping underprivileged children on the East African island at the time of the attack, which made international headlines.

They were both flown back to the UK last month and have been receiving treatment for their burns.

Writing for the Sunday Times, Miss Trup said: 'Thankfully, I have had not infections and no longer require any dressing for my wounds.

'However, I will be required to wear a pressure garment - which looks like a short-sleeved Lycra T-shirt - which will protect the skin graft and help prevent the build-up of scar tissue in the infected areas.

'I am also banned from sitting in the sun for at least 12 months - which is a small price to pay, even though I was once obsessed about sunbathing.'

Despite the mindless brutality of what happened to her last month, she plans to return next year to continue with her charity work.

She also reveals how she is haunted by questions as to why she and Miss Gee were attacked, saying: 'Since my return to Britain I have asked myself the same questions every day: why us? Why were Katie and I targeted? What motivated our attackers? Had they been following us our watching us for a while before they decided to carry out their unprovoked assault?'

She admits that the clothes she took with her to Zanzibar -shorts, strappy tops and mini-skirts - were wholly inappropriate for a trip to a Muslim country during the holy month of Ramadan.

But the teenager insists that this was done in ignorance and she immediately rectified it by buying lots of modest attire, including baggy trousers that both she and Miss Gee were wearing when they were attacked.

In her article for the Sunday Times, she 
said the friends did nothing to draw the wrong sort of attention to them
 and their behaviour was entirely respectable during their month-long 
stay.

'We laughed, sang, and enjoyed every moment we had in Zanzibar, all within the confines of what was religiously acceptable on the island,' she added.

'There we were, two 18-year-old Jewish girls from north London hoping to make some difference in the world while enjoying the life we've been given.'

Miss Trup, who is about to commence a history degree at Bristol University, said the first she knew something was amiss was when the moped driver stared at them intently, before nodding suggestively to the passenger sat behind.

She said the man smiled and then violently threw a jerry can full of battery acid at them - dousing both girls in a clear liquid which they initially mistook for water.

She said: 'Within a second of the moped speeding off, with its tail-light still in sight, we began screaming.

'Our screams were not out of 
frustration that our clothes had been drenched. They were screams of 
agony. We felt our flesh being seared.' As locals rushed to help, a 
disinterested soldier stood nearby watching as the girls lay on the 
floor writhing in agony - tearing at their skin and clothes in a futile 
bid to abate the pain.

'My entire upper body was burning, especially the right shoulder and torso,' she added.

'So
 were my feet, my face and my eyes. The skin on my right forearm looked 
as though it had had red paint thrown on it and I immediately noticed 
some discolouration on my torso and shoulder.

'The
 pain, coupled with the taste of the fluid flung at us - as part of 
which had spattered into my mouth - made me quickly realise that it was 
not water.' Mercifully, Miss Trup was carried into the nearby Indian 
Ocean by three men.

She said: 'I jumped in the water in my bra and briefs and began scrubbing my body with my hands. The pain was rapidly intensifying at a much faster pace than I could each burning area of my body.

'I caught a glimpse of the holes that had burnt into my clothes, which the young man was still holding.

'It became obvious to me that Katie and I
 had become the victims of a chemical attack.'

The girls were then taken
 to woefully underequipped local hospital, before a hotel where their 
'seared' skin was treated by standing them under cold showers.'

A few hours later they were airlifted to hospital in mainland Tanzania, before being flown back to the UK.

She spent weeks at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital undergoing skin grafts before being released. Her friend Miss Gee, whose burns were more severe, is still an in-patient.

Recalling her initial thoughts after the attack, she said: 'I thought about Katie Piper, the former model and television presenter who had had sulphuric acid thrown in her face on the orders of her ex-boyfriend and the impact that had on her life.

'I was terrified and still in pain, crying, wishing I was back home in Hampstead, north London, along with Mum and Dad, my two brothers and our two dogs.' Miss Trup also reveals that David Cameron has written to her praising her efforts in trying to make a 'real difference to the lives of children'.

She writes: 'With each day that passes I reflect on my time in Zanzibar with Katie and the fun we had ... Such happy memories have convinced me to return to the island next year to do more voluntary work.'
