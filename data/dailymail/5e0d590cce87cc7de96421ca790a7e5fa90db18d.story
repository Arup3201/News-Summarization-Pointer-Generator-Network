The search for a missing Alaska family of four has expanded to a densely wooded forest near a jail close to the family's home, but officials said there has been no information to lead them to look in any specific location.

Crews are using a helicopter and all-terrain vehicles to search for Rebecca Adams, 22; her daughters, Michelle Hundley, 5, and Jarraca Hundley, 3; and Adams' boyfriend, Brandon Jividen, 37.

Investigators also asked the public for information on the family missing for two weeks from their home in Kenai, about 65 miles southwest of Anchorage.

A desperate search is underway for Michelle Hundley, five, (pictured left) and her sister, three-year-old Jaracca (right) who went missing from their Alaska home with their mother and her boyfriend last month

'Don't assume information isn't worthwhile; we want to hear anything that may help,' Police Chief Gus Sandahl said.

Adams last had contact with relatives May 27, the day after Memorial Day.

The latest physical evidence of a sighting for Adams, Sandahl said, was an appearance with her children on a video surveillance recording May 18 at a Kenai business.

Local police received a call 
from a neighbor on May 31 who reported that a backyard shed door was 
lying open at the family's home.

Five
 days later on June 5, the same neighbor contacted the police to report 
that the family home appeared to have been lying empty for days.

Lanell
 Adams, who flew to Alaska from Washington state to look for her sister,
 said: 'I've called dozens of times. I'm scared more than anything.'

daughters

Adams said the last contact she had with her sister was distressing. The two women talked on the phone on Memorial Day weekend.

'She
 sounded very distressed,' Lanell Adams said. 'She just told me: ''Know 
that I love you,'' and she had to get off the phone very quickly.'

'Growing
 up we always had this thing, we say 'Thou shall not lie' and you 
always have to tell the truth,' Lanell Adams said. 'I asked her, ''Thou 
shall not lie, Becca, are you ok?' She said, ''Don't ask me that right 
now. Just know that I love you.'

Police began investigating last weekend, and the FBI joined in the search.

The family lives in a four-plex near the Wildwood Correction Facility, but they failed to pay rent this month. Residents tell the Peninsula Clarion the neighborhood is quiet but has a transitory nature.

'We don't know everybody in our building, much less buildings down the street,' said Amy Murrell-Haunold, who lives on the same street as the missing family.

Jeff Pfile and Anna Haave manage the building where the family has lived for two years. They said it was unusual for the Adams and Jividen to be late with a rent payment.

'If I felt they were going out of town I would have been the first person they called because they are so responsible (for paying their rent on time),' Haave said. 'For them to not say anything is not normal.'

Police say vehicles belonging to Jividen and Adams remain parked at the four-plex, and their cellphones have been turned off. The family's brown and white English springer spaniel named Sparks also is missing.

The father of her two girls, Jaramiah Hundley, died in a motorcycle crash in May 2012.

Besides local police and the FBI, fire officials, canine units and wilderness search groups from across Alaska have been brought to Kenai to help search.

Alaska State Troopers provided a helicopter to help search from the air, and police have used all-terrain vehicles on trails in woods near the home. The search area has expanded to areas north of the correctional facility.

Dog teams 
and helicopters have been drafted in to search the area surrounding 
Kenai.

On the lookout: A massive search for a family of four in Alaska is focusing on nearby woods and the behavior of one of the missing, a mother of two young children

The family disappeared from their home in Kenai, Alaska last month after relatives said that the mother, Rebecca Adams was showing signs of distress

Lt. David Cook told ABC: 'At this point it’s not apparent where 
they have gone or where they might be.

'The investigation 
does not show that is foul play at this point, but we are very deep into
 the investigation of the missing persons.'

Lt. Cook added: 'The family has expressed some concern 
with the behavior of their sister Rebecca and have some concerns within 
her relationship [to Brandon].'

A Facebook group called Seeking 
Alaska's Missing  shared a picture of the missing family and urged 
anyone with information to contact the Kenai Police Department. The 
poster claimed that the family went missing on May 27.

Police say they receive new information about the missing family every day, but nothing that would lead to finding them or even a specific location to search.

'We remain optimistic we will be able to reunite them with their family,' Sandahl said. 'We want nothing more at this point and hope they are safe.'

Family members have put up fliers of the missing family members in popular fishing areas the family frequented on the Kenai Peninsula, and police statewide have been alerted, Sandahl said.

No detail about their possible whereabouts is insignificant, he said.

Kenai, a rural fishing port in the Gulf of Alaska, has a population of around 7,000 people and is 160 miles from Anchorage.
