The head of the South Korean ferry company responsible for the deaths of 304 people who drowned when its vessel capsized in April has been jailed for ten years.

Kim Han-sik, the chief executive of Chonghaejin Marine, was found guilty of negligence causing death and embezzlement - as it emerged he routinely allowed overloading and illegal renovations to be made to increase the ship's capacity.

The sentence is the toughest penalty handed down to anyone other than the ferry's crew over the tragedy - in which 304 passengers, mostly teenage children died.

Kim Han-sik, the chief executive of Chonghaejin Marine who operated the ferry on which 304 people died, has been jailed for ten years  

Kim, 71, also received a 2 million won (£1150) fine for failing to stop the improper storage and overloaded cargo on the ship that judges ruled contributed to the sinking, the Gwangju District Court said in a statement.

He apologised to the families of the victims but said last month that he was simply a paid employee of the company and the decisions that led to the disaster were made by the firm's de-facto owner, Yoo Byung-un.

Yoo, who was the head of the family that owned a holding company at the centre of a network of business interests that included the ferry operator, was found dead in June.

The overloaded Sewol, carrying 476 people, capsized 12 miles off the island of Byungpoongon on April 16 - while making a turn on a routine voyage to the holiday island of Jeju.

The vessel was later found to be defective, with additions made to increase passenger capacity making it top-heavy and unstable.

By routinely overloading the Sewol, Chonghaejin made an extra £2 million in profit in the past year, according to the indictment. 

Alongside Kim, four other Chonghaejin officials were sentenced to three to six years in prison on similar charges, and two other company employees got suspended prison sentences, according to a court verdict.  

Doomed: The 6,825-tonne Sewol ferry was carrying 476 people on board when it capsized. Of the 304 who died, 250 were students from the same high school 

An official from the Korea Shipping Association, which oversees safety issues of ships, was sentenced to three years in prison for allowing the ferry to leave a port near Seoul without checking its cargo and storage. 

Two employees at a private company that loaded the ship both received a two-year prison term. 

During the trial, prosecutor Park Jae-eok said the five jailed defendants neglected the passengers' safety in return for economic benefits and must be held responsible.

Kim, the CEO, encouraged managers at a weekly gathering to meet the ferry's cargo goals even as he sought to sell the ship because of instability caused by the redesign, mounting losses and too much cost, Park said. 

If the cargo goal was not met, the weekly meeting was used to caution employees, he said.

The approach of winter and the structural weakening of the vessel that has been under water for seven months in strong currents made it dangerous for divers to continue searching

Negligent: Lee Jun-Seok, the captain of the South Korea ferry that capsized killing 300 people including 250 pupils from the same school, was sentenced to 36 years in prison, but acquitted of murder

The prosecutor also said that the employees at Chonghaejin were responsible for the captain and crew's abandonment of the sinking ship and the failure to protect passengers because they did not oversee sailors' emergency training and spent only £1 on training last year. 

That money covered the fee for issuing a paper for a sailor who received education elsewhere, Park said.

The 15 surviving crew members including the captain were convicted last week on negligence charges and sentenced to between five and 36 years in jail.

Last month South Korean prosecutors sought the death penalty for the captain of the ferry, Lee Joon-seok, 68 - after branding him a liar who abandoned the Sewol despite knowing that hundreds of trapped passengers would probably die.

The decision to end the search was agreed by the families of the nine passengers still missing

The public rage directed at Lee had intensified following the release of pictures showing him clambering aboard a lifeboat while hundreds of young passengers remained trapped in their cabins and other parts of the sinking ferry.

It emerged that before leaving his ship the captain had instructed the remaining passengers to stay where they were, even as the vessel began to tilt dramatically. 

Prosecutors argued that this decision alone contributed to the tragic loss of life.

Many of the victims' families also demanded the death sentence but Lee was ultimately convicted of gross negligence last week and sentenced to 36 years behind bars - meaning he will most likely die in pirson. 

After the prosecution rested its case, Lee apologised to the families of the victims, saying he never intended to harm anyone.

'I will repent until the day I die and ask for the victims' families' forgiveness,' he said. 'I swear with my hand over my heart, I did not intend to kill anyone. I never even thought of such a thing.' 

More than seven months after the ferry Sewol sank on its way to a southern resort island, the country is still grappling with the aftermath of the disaster that exposed serious shortcomings in public safety and sparked fierce political wrangling

Divers recovered 295 bodies from the wreckage before the government stopped underwater searches last week. Nine victims remain missing.
