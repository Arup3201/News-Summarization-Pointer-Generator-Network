Just 16 seconds after two police officers pulled up in a patrol car and confronted Kajieme Powell, he was dying in a hail of bullets. The young black man had been behaving erratically for some minutes, seemingly waiting for the police to come and get him after he walked out of a shop in St Louis, Missouri, with two stolen bottles of energy drink.

Scanning the street outside as he paced back and forth, he kept one hand thrust into his pocket, clutching the knife he was about to brandish. But as recorded by a local man with a mobile phone, Powell’s end was brutally swift — and arguably unnecessary.

After telling him repeatedly to drop the knife he drew from his pocket, the officers both opened fire with their handguns when he was about 10ft away. Witnesses said 25-year-old Powell was shouting: ‘Shoot me! Shoot me!’

Police later said he had been moving towards them threateningly, but that hardly seems obvious in the video footage. After letting off at least nine rounds — three times the number the entire British police fired in anger last year — the tragedy veered into farce as the officers decided to handcuff his lifeless body.

What makes Tuesday’s shocking video footage particularly explosive is that it was taken just three miles from Ferguson, the St Louis suburb which has been convulsed by serious unrest after a white policeman shot dead unarmed black youth Michael Brown two weeks ago.

The latest killing is guaranteed to inflame racial tensions in the U.S. already reaching boiling point, and to fuel accusations that trigger-happy white police are mowing down young blacks without compunction.

Such claims — which for years have soured America’s boasts to have overcome its ugly racist past — were compounded this week by alarming new footage of a policeman threatening to kill peaceful demonstrators in Ferguson.

The officer, who has been suspended indefinitely, was filmed repeatedly shouting: ‘Get back or I’m going to f***ing kill you,’ as he aimed his semi-automatic assault rifle at protesters.

While officers in Ferguson have faced serious disorder in recent days, critics have pointed out that the almost military response of the police has served to exacerbate the problem by attracting violent troublemakers to the town. In the process, this Midwest backwater has thrown up images of civil unrest the like of which haven’t been seen in the U.S. since Los Angeles was torn apart in 1992 after police were cleared of beating up black motorist Rodney King.

Last Sunday night, a man in his early 20s with a bandana covering his face was seen confronting an army of riot police. At one point, he lifted up his vest to show the handgun tucked into his low-slung shorts. It was unclear whether it was a warning, or a show of defiance.

At that point, it was 12.45am, well past the midnight-5am curfew set earlier that day, and the police were intent on clearing the main artery running through this working-class suburb. Five heavily armoured SWAT team trucks had lined up across the street with around 100 riot police behind them. Dressed in combat gear, gas masks and army helmets, and armed to the teeth with shotguns and assault rifles, they started advancing, firing tear gas into a 300-strong crowd who threw back bottles, rocks and Molotov cocktails.

After police arrived, the 25-year-old was filmed walking towards the car, brandishing a knife which he had drawn from his pocket. Witnesses said Mr Powell was shouting 'Shoot me! Shoot me!'

And so it has gone on, night after night for the two weeks since — just 100 yards away down a side street — officer Darren Wilson shot dead 18-year-old Brown.

For days, events in Ferguson followed a routine. As darkness fell on this suburb of 21,000 people, the locals who had demonstrated peacefully during the day headed home, and the mood turned uglier. The street was filled with young — mainly black — men from out of town, sporting the occasional gang tattoo, who taunted the police with insults, chanting: ‘Hands Up, Don’t Shoot’.

Taking the lead have been megaphone-clutching professional agitators from radical groups such as the Revolutionary Communist Party, who try to incite fights with the police. These Left-wing rabble-rousers tend to be white, infuriating local black leaders who accuse them of hijacking the protest.

The protesters have each night been faced by an impassive battle line of local and state police. Clad in head-to-toe combat gear and aiming sniper rifles, they look  more like soldiers. As well as firing tear gas, stun grenades and rubber bullets, they have even used a sonic cannon — or Long Range Acoustic Device — which emits a noise like a deranged ambulance siren.

At 8.30pm on Sunday night, to the sound 
of sporadic bursts of gunfire, the violence took an ugly turn. Police 
claimed they were being shot at in ‘pre-planned agitation’, and went on 
the offensive. The tear gas started all over again, this time catching 
ordinary people still out on the streets. An eight-year-old boy was 
among those gassed.

On Monday, the police reported coming under ‘heavy gunfire’ and arrested 78 people as they tried to stop the looting. Two demonstrators were shot but not — police insisted — by them. That night, officers were bolstered by the National Guard, who arrived in a fleet of Humvee armoured cars after Missouri governor Jay Nixon took the drastic measure of calling them in. Some community leaders said they had seen different street gangs working together to attack the police, and that members had said they wanted to kill a policeman in revenge for Brown.

Nearly six years after the U.S. elected its first black President, the unrest in Ferguson has graphically illustrated how the country’s race relations are as rancorous and turbulent as ever.

For all the feelgood, liberal waffle about Barack Obama’s supposedly ‘post-racial’ America, the last Western country to ban slavery within its borders is still rife with racial tension.

The incident took place three miles from where an officer shot dead an unarmed black youth, Michael Brown, just two weeks ago

The trouble started two weeks ago today after a scuffle involving Brown and 28-year-old Wilson ended with the teenager being fatally shot in a burst of gunfire. Accounts as to how this happened differ sharply, although there seems to be agreement that Wilson was inside his patrol car and Brown was leaning in through an open window as they argued whether the officer had the right to tell him to stop walking in the street and get on the pavement.

The policeman’s gun then went off — according to the officer, because Brown punched him in the face and tried to grab the weapon. But according to Brown’s companion, Dorian Johnson, Wilson grabbed his friend around the throat and started firing when he tried to run away.

Despite Obama hoping the racial divide would be healed in the U.S., no one expects the president to do much about the latest incidents

Some witnesses say they saw Brown turn around and move threateningly towards the policeman, others say he stayed stock still and might even have put his hands up. Either way, he was shot six times, including once in the face and again in the head.

Wilson has gone into hiding, suspended on full pay, while a grand jury considers whether to bring charges, a process that can take weeks.

Why might Brown have become violent? Possibly because — according to the town’s police chief — Wilson had realised that the teenagers fitted the descriptions of two youths who had just stolen cigarillos from a nearby convenience store.

While locals painted Brown as a sweet kid keen to go to university, police released video footage of the shoplifting. It showed a huge teenager — apparently Brown, who was 6ft 4in — sauntering out of the store, shoving aside a small shopkeeper who tried to stop him.

His friend Johnson has reportedly admitted he and Brown stole the cigarillos, but the dead man’s furious family accused the police of trying to poison their son’s name and somehow justify his shooting.

The video helped to divide reaction to the killing along racial lines: local community leaders say Ferguson is a powder keg that could blow up again any time, so long as the policeman remains uncharged.

One thing’s for sure, no one expects Obama — once a charismatic speaker decrying racial injustice — to do much about it. Last week, he broke off briefly from holiday on the millionaires’ island of Martha’s Vineyard to appeal for calm, blandly assuring protesters he understood ‘the passions and anger’.

D emonstrators insist they are protesting about far more than just the case of Brown. Curfew-breaking protester Kerry Green said it was about everyday racial prejudice by the police. ‘It’s about us riding down the street with three friends in the car and we get pulled over,’ he said.

Locals say it’s hard for outsiders to understand the depth of the divide in Ferguson, where a two-thirds black population has a 53-strong police force, of which only three officers are African-American.

Publicity hungry civil rights veterans such as Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton have followed the TV news crews pouring into town, anxious to ram home how this case symbolises everything wrong with America.

Michael Brown is ‘not on trial’, Sharpton thundered at a local church on Sunday morning. ‘America is on trial!’ However hyperbolic the language, it’s true that at the heart of this troubling story is the racial schism which once more threatens to tear apart the fabric of American society.

When such men as Kajieme Powell and Michael Brown are killed, white Americans see a criminal and officers who must protect themselves; black Americans see racist police who treat them with contempt.

More than 50 years after Martin Luther King made his I Have A Dream speech about bringing an end to racism in the U.S, it seems black and white Americans mistrust each other almost as much as ever.
