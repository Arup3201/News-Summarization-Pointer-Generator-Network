Stefan Scepovic insisted Celtic had always been his first choice after finally completing his controversial on-off move from Sporting Gijon.

The 24-year-old Serbia international looked to have turned his back on the Scottish champions in favour of a move to Getafe despite passing a Celtic medical in Paris and agreeing terms on a move to Glasgow.

But after the Parkhead club had made their disgust known at Scepovic’s change of heart, suddenly the £2.2million deal was back on again amid claims that Spanish financial play rules had sunk the move to Getafe.

As he was unveiled on Tuesday night on a four-year deal, Scepovic vowed to work hard to win over the fans. But he flatly denied messing Celtic about and even challenged his detractors to prove anything other than Ronny Deila’s side were always his preferred option.

‘My first choice was always Celtic,’ insisted the striker. ‘I never said I didn’t want to come here. I don’t know why people say things like that. When I spoke with my family and friends, I always said my choice was to come here. Yes, there were some problems in the deal but the most important thing is that I am here now.

‘I know (some fans might be wary). But

they can search the internet and they will never find any quotes from me where I said I didn’t want to come to Celtic. Never — because I didn’t say it.

‘I know Celtic is a big club with a lot of history and great fans. I want to prove I can play at a big club like Celtic.

‘I’ll work hard and do everything to prove I can play here and bring something different.

‘Monday was a tough day, but that’s football,’ he added. ‘I was in my house watching TV and I was really a little bit nervous because of the situation. But at the same time I was calm. I had a choice before I chose Celtic and I was happy when I knew I would be a Celtic player.

‘What made me nervous? It’s normal. I was nervous because maybe there were some problems. But I don’t want to look at what happened before. I just look to the future.’
