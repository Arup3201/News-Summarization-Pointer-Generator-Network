Treatment: Caroline Biden has been transferred from a Pennsylvania rehab facility to one in the warmer climes of Delray Beach, Florida

Vice President Joe Biden's niece has been ordered to receive anger management treatment at a beach side rehab facility in Florida.

Caroline Biden was arrested at her luxury apartment in Tribeca, New York, on September 17 after she allegedly went mad at her roommate over unpaid rent.

She was last seen in court on October 29 when she attended a hearing and appeared to have a black eye that she tried keeping hidden using sunglasses.

The 26-year-old was charged with resisting arrest, obstructing governmental administration and harassment.

She was not present at the latest hearing that took place on Wednesday and her team of lawyers appeared in her place.

'She’s undergoing treatment for the issues she has with anger management,' attorney James Liguori told the court, according to The New York Post.

'She’s truly sorry for what she did and she’s truly remorseful.'

Biden, who graduated from Georgetown University and was working at a Manhattan art gallery before her arrest, was transferred to a Florida rehab facility on January 20 after receiving treatment at their sister site in Pennsylvania.

It is unclear when she first checked into the Pennsylvania facility, called Caron Place.

Serious setting: A Manhattan judge has ordered that Biden, 26, has to remain at Caron Renaissance Ocean Drive (pictured) for three more months

Picturesque: Before moving to the Florida facility on January 20, Biden had been staying at the sister site in Wernersville, Pennsylvania, which does not treat anger management issues unless it is an underlying cause of drug addiction

Her lawyers only said that she was receiving treatment for anger management issues, but The Post reports that Caron Place only provides assistance with anger issues if they are connected to drug addiction.

A former friend previously reported that Ms Biden attended a different rehab program for alcohol and Adderall addiction during college.

While she may have been enjoying the rural location of Caron Place in Wernersville, which is surrounded by mountains, the latest facility is located in a much more enviable climate.

She is now staying at Caron Renaissance Ocean Drive in Delray Beach, Florida where the weather on Thursday had an expected high of 81.

The facility's website describes how their executive chef prepares all of their patients' meals but they also have fully-stocked kitchens with state-of-the-art amenities in their rooms.

'A full housekeeping staff helps clients stay focused on the task at hand rather than day-to-day chores,' the site explains.

Signs of trouble: Caroline was transported to a hospital wrapped in a sheet by wheelchair after being arrest on September 17 for getting into a physical altercation with her roommate

Drama: After being treated for undisclosed injuries or conditions, she was released and appeared in court the next month, though her lawyers went in her place this week as she is in Florida

Treatment there costs $35,000 for the first month and $18,000 for each subsequent month.

The Manhattan District Attorney stipulated that she stay there for an additional three months as part of a plea deal, meaning that the total sum will be north of $71,000, not including the fees for her time in the Pennsylvania facility.

Connected: Caroline is the daughter of Vice President Joe Biden's brother James

The anger management treatment was deemed necessary after she got into a physical altercation not only with her roommate but also with the police officer who arrested her.

Court documents described how she also tried to sneak out of the station house once officers put her inside a holding cell.

'I am informed that Officer Martin had to outstretch both of his arms horizontally so the defendant could not get around him and that the defendant stated in substance, "Don’t touch me," and attempted to push away from Officer Martin,' an officer wrote in the criminal complaint.

'I am informed by Officer Martin that he was able to gain control of the defendant by holding her arm and that when he was walking her back to the holding cell, the defendant grabbed a door frame, and held onto cells, in an effort to prevent Officer Martin from bringing her back to the holding cell, an official function.'

This is not Miss Biden's first run-in with the law, as she was briefly detained by Amtrak police over a disputed train fare in 2009.

At the time she claimed she was treated unfairly because of her family's connection to the Vice President, and said she had intended to pay for her ticket on the train, a friend said.
