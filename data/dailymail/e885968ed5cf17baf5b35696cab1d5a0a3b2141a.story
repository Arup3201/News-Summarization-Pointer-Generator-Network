The beauty giant already counts Eva Longoria, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and Blake Lively as spokeswomen but clearly not content with their glamorous lot, L'Oreal has added another Hollywood beauty to its roster.

A-list actress Naomi Watts is the latest recruit and she was chosen by the French beauty giant because of her 'immeasurable talent and graceful beauty.'

A spokesperson for the brand said: 'Naomi consistently takes on Hollywood's most versatile and challenging roles. 

'Her subtle delicateness and mastery of complex characters have inspired the world's most respected contemporary film directors.'

These qualities, say the brand, made her a natural choice to join L’Oréal Paris’ family of spokespersons. 

'Naomi is the symbol of genuine and radiant beauty. Her seemingly fragile exterior contrasts with the fierce determination that has driven her career to great heights. Luminous, sincere and charismatic, she embodies the essence of a Woman of Worth. 

'Her timeless beauty has made her the perfect woman to endorse our ultimate skincare innovation, Revitalift Filler,' enthused Cyril Chapuy, Brand Global President of L’Oréal Paris.

Speaking about her latest role, the 46-year-old added: 'I am deeply honoured to join this inspirational brand. L’Oréal Paris has been telling women for decades that they are "worth it" - this is not a slogan, it’s an inspirational mantra. 

'L’Oréal Paris embodies much more than legendary products, it also promotes self-affirmation, self-confidence and allows each and every woman to value herself no matter what her age, background or nationality.'

Born in England, Naomi was raised in Australia, where she studied acting and launched her stellar career.

Her breakthrough performance came in David Lynch’s Mulholland Drive in 2001; the role earned her Best Actress awards from the National Board of Review and National Society of Film Critics. 

She went on to star in  tragedies like Alejandro’s Gonzales Inarritu’s 21 Grams, where she starred alongside Sean Penn, to major blockbusters, such as Peter Jackson’s epic remake of King Kong in 2005. 

Naomi’s upcoming projects include director Gus Van Sant’s latest film, Sea of Trees alongside Matthew McConaughey. 

She is now shooting Demolition co-starring Jake Gyllenhall. Naomi also devotes her time to raising awareness for AIDS related issues and is a Goodwill Ambassador for the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS and an inaugural member of the AIDS Red Ribbon Awards.
