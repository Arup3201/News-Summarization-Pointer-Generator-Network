They are the images that are designed to inspire wanderlust in us all and now they have been announced as the finalists of National Geographic Traveller's photography competition.

From a boy dressed in a bear bearskin to a train whizzing through the Sri Lankan countryside with people clinging to the outside of the carriages, the images capture a moment in the travels of photographers from around the world.

But not all the photos are from exotic destinations, the judges also listed an image of London's Southbank at night as a finalist.
