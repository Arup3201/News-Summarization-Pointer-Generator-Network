Google is working on a $120million array of exciting new projects across 800,000 sq ft to expand the headquarters of its ever-growing empire - including a mammoth private museum for its best friends.

The internet search giant, based in Mountain View, California, is putting together plans for secret labs to test revolutionary wireless home entertainment systems and new optical technology.

Google is preparing for a future in which hardware is a crucial part of its brand, after a hiring spree last year and as it closes in a $12.5billion buyout of phone maker Motorola.

Location: The position of Google's corporate HQ and its Google/@home radio frequency testing lab

One of the most interesting ideas 
revealed in city council documents is of a 120,000 sq ft ‘Google 
Experience Center’, which would host its most important clients and 
demonstrate new products.

‘The Experience Center would not 
typically be open to the public - consisting of invited groups, and 
guests whose interests will be as vast as Google's range of products,’ 
architect Andrew Burnett said.

Mr Burnett told the council that the 
centre will operate like a ‘museum, exhibit, or mercantile space 
allowing flexibility in the exhibits’ with up to 900 VIPs, reported the 
San Jose Mercury News.

Technology analyst Rob Enderle said 
the non-public demonstration facility will became a showcase for the 
firm as it tries to impress customers and its business partners with an 
‘oh wow’ moment.

Google, which is now worth an 
eye-watering $197billion, is also planning a new testing centre for its 
‘@home’ product, which will wirelessly stream data or music to devices 
around a house.

It’s believed the company is set to 
launch a wireless home audio product this year. Google also wants to 
adapt a lab for testing ‘Project X’, focussed on mysterious ‘precision 
optical technology’.

Ideas: Project X's purpose is still unclear, but Google co-founder Sergey Brin, pictured, has since last year been focusing on a list of secret projects at the company, including efforts to develop a driverless car

Cycling to work: The nine-figure plans also include amenities for its army of new staff, including cafeterias, employee showers and charging stations for electric cars

amenities for its army of new staff, including cafeterias, employee 
showers and charging stations for electric cars, reported the San Jose 
Mercury News.

Google refused to say much about the Experience Centre, or to comment on its new hardware testing labs 
and the secretive Project X, according to reports in the local media.

However, public documents show the company is building a laboratory at 1600
Shoreline Boulevard that will 
screen out radio frequency signals for a wireless division called 
Google/@home.

At other parts of its sprawling campus
thermal and anechoic chambers are being built which can be used to test
the radiation patterns of antennae.

In the Project X testing area, city 
records show a laboratory will use rare gases like argon, a plasma 
cleaner that can scrub materials of contaminants, and arcane 
optical-coating technology.

Project X's purpose is still unclear, 
but Google co-founder Sergey Brin has since last year been focusing on a
list of secret projects at the company, including efforts to develop a 
driverless car.
