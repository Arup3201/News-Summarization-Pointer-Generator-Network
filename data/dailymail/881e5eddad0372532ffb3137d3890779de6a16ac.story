A frustrated office worker's request to a colleague to stop pinching their lunch from the fridge has sparked a hilarious note war between the two.

The A4 notes pinned to the fridge door of an office kitchen have gone viral on a New Zealand radio Facebook page due to the hilarious content contained on them.

What starts as a simple request to the 'turkey and Swiss on Rye' owner to the 'sandwich thief' to stop stealing their lunch, soon turns into an anonymous office stand-off with several demands being traded.

The passive-aggressive note which started the war between the two office workers

The first demand from the anonymous thief, which infuriates the sandwich thief even further

A return threat from the owner of the 'Turkey and Swiss on Rye' that they will bring HR in to conversation

'To the person who keeps stealing my sandwiches (Turkey and Swiss with mayo on Rye)...' the first of many passive-aggressive notes reads.

'Stop stealing other people's property!!!'

What follows is one of several demands from the thief to pay $10 and leave it in the fridge in return for the person's lunch - or they'll 'never see it undigested again.'

The thief, a man, includes a picture of him holding a portion of the 'Turkey and Swiss on Rye' - one of many he posts picture with him holding it to prove he has it in his possession.

Refusing to take the sandwich owner's advice to be a 'responsible adult' seriously, he further infuriates 'Turkey and Swiss on rye' who threatens the thief with human resources action.

The conversation loses its professionalism along the way and becomes increasingly personal, before 'Tina from HR' wades in with a note to the sandwich owner.

'Please return the sandwich to the owner and we won't investigate this any further,' Tina writes.

To which the thief replies: 'Buy me a pizza.'

Tina responds: 'No'

The defeated sandwich owner asks...

More evidence that the man is in possession of the sandwich

The owner follows through on his threat to contact HR and a letter from Tina appears on the fridge door

The thief takes his demands to the top

Who would have thought? Tina refuses

The three-way dialogue continues until the thief posts a lengthy note with an image of an empty plate proving that he has devoured the sandwich in full.

It is at this point the alleged thief, 'Francis', is finally found out when Tina traces the printed A4 sheets back to his account.

'Francis we checked the office printer queue and traced the requests back to your desk. Could you please see me at your earliest convenience.'

The hilarious note war winds up with Francis grovelling for his job with a simple one-line request pleading not to be fired.

'Please don't fire me.'

The thief rubs it in even more

The sandwich owner cracks with their first personal spray at the thief

The thief devours the sandwich and posts the finished meal

Caught out: Francis's cover is blown
