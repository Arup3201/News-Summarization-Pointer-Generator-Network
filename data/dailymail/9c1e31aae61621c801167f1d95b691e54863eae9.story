Notorious serial killer Loren Herzog has committed suicide, it was revealed last night.

The body of Herzog, 46, was found Monday night hanging inside his trailer located immediately outside the grounds of High Desert State Prison in Susanville, the Lassen County Sheriff's Department said.

He was living so close to a prison because at the time of his death Herzog was in the middle of a fierce debate over where he was living and was the subject of a lawsuit seeking to banish him from the remote northeast California county.

Normally, under Californian law, once someone is released from prison they return to the last place they lived. But relatives of victims can ask that they live at least 35 miles from their homes. Until this was resolved authorities allowed him to live in the grounds of the prison.

Herzog was at the beginning of a 78-year prison sentence for three murder convictions when an appeals court in 2004 ruled investigators illegally coerced his confession.

Without the confession, prosecutors 
said they were left little evidence and had no choice but to offer 
Herzog a deal to plead guilty to voluntary manslaughter for the killing 
of Cyndi Vanderheiden, 25, in November 1998.

His sentence was reduced to 14 years and he was released on parole in September 2010 after serving 11 years.

With credit for time served dating 
back to his 1999 arrest and time off for good behavior, the prison 
system was unable to hold him longer despite calls for his continued 
incarceration.

Herzog and childhood friend Wesley 
Shermantine were dubbed the Speed Freak Killers when they were arrested 
in 1999 for Vanderheiden's murder and several others.

The two were accused of terrorizing San Joaquin County for 15 years by going on methamphetamine-fueled killing sprees.

Shermantine is on California's Death Row after being convicted of four murders.

Before Herzog's release in 2010, 
family members of the alleged victims and influential San Joaquin County
 politicians persuaded California Department of Corrections and 
Rehabilitation officials to parole Herzog far from the Central Valley 
region, where the murders occurred.

CDCR's decision to locate him in 
Lassen County set off a furor there that culminated with the city of 
Susanville filing a lawsuit alleging prison officials were wrong to make
 Herzog live there.

A Lassen County judge agreed late last year and ordered prison officials to remove Herzog.

He remained living in a trailer on the prison grounds in Susanville while CDCR appealed the judge's ruling.

Parole agents went to Herzog's home around midnight Tuesday when a low-battery alarm on his GPS unit went off.

State and county authorities are investigating his death.
