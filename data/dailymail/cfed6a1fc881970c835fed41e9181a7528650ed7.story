Real Madrid’s noisy neighbours were at it again in the early hours of Saturday morning in the Spanish capital. Last season Diego Simeone’s side pipped Real Madrid to the La Liga title, now they have beaten them in the Spanish Super Cup.

Money might buy a club the best players from the last World Cup but Atletico Madrid’s motivation and organisation continues to be absolutely priceless and it was too much for Carlo Ancelotti’s confused European Champions who were behind after 80 seconds and never found a way back. 

Clinical: Atletico Madrid's Mario Mandzukic makes it 1-0 against Real Madrid in the second leg match of the Spanish Super Cup

Goal hero: Atletico striker Mario Mandzukic lifts the Super Cup trophy after beating Real Madrid on Friday

Glory boys: Atletico have started the season as they ended the last, by eclipsing their illustrious neighbours and picking up a trophy

Atletico Madrid: Moya; Juanfran, Godín, Miranda, Siqueira; Tiago, Gabi; Koke, Raul García, Griezmann (Jiminez 73); Mandzukic

Subs: Oblak, Suarez, Rodriguez, Ansaldi, Niguez, Gimenez

Goal: Mandzukic 2

Real Madrid: Casillas; Carvajal, Varane, Ramos, Coentrao (Marcelo 70); Modric, Kroos (Ronaldo 45), Xabi Alonso; James (Isco 65), Benzema, Bale

Subs: Navas, Pepe, Arbeloa, Illarra

With the league season due to start this weekend all is not as it should be for Ancelotti. 

Midfielder Sami Khedira went to watch his brother play in Germany, Angel Di Maria was left out of the squad completely and Cristiano Ronaldo was left on the bench not fit to start.

With no Ronaldo or Di Maria the onus was very much on Bale who has been Real Madrid’s best player in pre-season but before the Welshman could have an impact a defence strangely missing the benched Pepe was embarrassed by Atletico’s first attack. 

Their big summer signings Antoine Griezmann and Mario Mandzukic must find the goals that Diego Costa scored last season – the hope is that the Croatian will hold the ball up and the Frenchman will feed off him but it was the other way around inside two minutes and Atletico Madrid were in front courtesy of Mandzukic’s first goal for the club.

Atletico’s incredible knack of replacing the strikers they are forced to sell has seen them go from Diego Forlan to Sergio Agüero and Radamel Falcao to Diego Costa. 

Mandzukic has started well with a goal against the old enemy that wins a Cup final. 

 

Delight: Atletico's Mario Mandzukic (centre) celebrates his second-minute strike against  Real Madrid at Vicente Calderon on Friday

 

Real Madrid forced their first corner and from it Luka Modric sent a shot over and they were then given a brief one-man advantage by referee David Fernandez.

Fabio Coentrao clashed with Juanfran and as the Atletico full-back was waiting to come back on after having treatment, James almost equalised for Real with a shot parried by Miguel Moya.

Simeone was fuming at the delay in Juanfran being allowed back onto the pitch and after some figure wagging and a tap on the back of the fourth official’s head he was sent off. 

It is hard to think of another coach in world football at the moment who has the same communion with his supporters and the dismissal only increased the volume in the Calderon.

On the ball: Gareth Bale of Real Madrid takes on Diego Godin of Atletico Madrid at Vicente Calderon on Friday

Madrid’s next chance came after Bale was bundled over by Godin and from Rodriguez's free-kick, Xabi Alsono fired a shot just wide.

Modric then crossed for Rodriguez to head wide of Moya’s far post. The Colombian was everywhere for Madrid and he fed Bale who shot just wide as Madrid continue to press.

But Atletico Madrid are a hard team to break down once they are in front and with Raul Garcia threatening at the other end they almost doubled their lead. First he shot from distance forcing a corner and then he headed Koke’s kick just wide.

Ronaldo replaced Toni Kroos at half time as Real Madrid switched to a 4-2-3-1 but it was Atletico Madrid who started the brighter with Siqueira drawing a yellow card from Modric and Raul Garcia crashing a shot off the underside of the crossbar. 

The midfielder who got the all important equaliser in the first leg sent another shot whistling past Casillas’ post as Atletico did far more with less possession than their rivals.

Roanldo finally tested Moya but his shot was comfortably held and when Bale tumbled in the box spinning away from Siqueira as the referee waved away the appeals for a penalty.

Up for it: Atletico's Koke, centre, tangles with Real's James Rodriguez, left, in an aerial duel

For Atletico Madrid Koke shot just over and Griezmann had the chance of the second half but dragged his shot wide. He was taken off to be replaced by Raul Gimenez who signed this summer from Mexican club America and got himself in trouble with his new supporters after an old allegiance to Real was revealed. Raucous nights like this one will soon clear him of any doubts he is at the wrong Madrid club.

Atletico fans took a deep breath when the board for injury time showed four added minutes but it was in stoppage time that Modric picked up a second yellow and so Real were reduced to ten men.

Atletico held out to win their first trophy of the season with the dismissed Simeone celebrating in the front row of the main stand with supporters - it seems news of his team’s decline in light of the sale of Diego Costa and the return of Thibuat Courtois have been greatly exaggerated.
