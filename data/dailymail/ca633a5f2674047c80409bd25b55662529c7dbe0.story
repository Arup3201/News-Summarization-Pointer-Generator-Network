A reality show that has yet to premiere is already facing legal troubles over one of its stars' Britney Spears impersonation act.

Lifetime's new series Little Women LA follows the lives of a group of little people including Elena Gant, who is known for doing a 'Little Britney' act in Las Vegas.

But according to TMZ, Jeff Beacher, the owner of Beacher's Madhouse, which is located in the MGM Grand Hotel, has sent a cease and desist letter to the producers of the show, claiming that he owns the rights to her act.

Legal threat: Jeff Beacher (pictured), the owner of Beacher's Madhouse, has reportedly sent a cease and desist letter to the producers of the show, claiming that he owns the rights to her act

The theater owner has reportedly threatened to sue if the producers exploit Elena's reputation as 'Little Britney' and use it to promote the show.

Mr Beacher says he also owns the copyright for other impersonation acts including 'Little Miley', 'Little Kesha', 'Little Gaga' and 'Little Katy Perry', and he's willing to take legal action if any of them are violated.

Competition: The four-foot-four blonde's act debuted at BeacherÂ¿s Madhouse on December 27th, the very same night Britney's Vegas Piece of Me act opened at Planet Hollywood

The real deal: But while Elena reportedly makes $310 a night to impersonate Britney Spears, the iconic pop star rakes in about $310,000 for each show

Mr Beacher may feel threatened by the TV show, but it's Britney Spears herself who should be intimidated by Elena's act.

Indeed, the four-foot-four future reality star's act debuted at Beacher's Madhouse on December 27th, the very same night Britney's Vegas Piece of Me act opened at Planet Hollywood.

But while the iconic pop star rakes in about $310,000 for each show, her lookalike reportedly makes just $310 a night.

Little Women: LA is set to premiere on Lifetime on Tuesday, May 27, at 10pm ET
