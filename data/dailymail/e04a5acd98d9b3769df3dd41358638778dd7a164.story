Dozens of corrupt police officers helped organised criminals hide evidence, intimidate witnesses and access details of ongoing operations, according to a leaked report.

An internal investigation by the Metropolitan Police claimed officers were bribed to destroy surveillance logs and some officers even co-owned houses and racehorses with suspected gang leaders.

The 2002 report, produced as part of Operation Tiberius, an investigation into police corruption, named 80 corrupt officers. More than half of them were still serving at the time.

'Corrupt': The report alleges that criminals had free access to information held by the Metropolitan Police

The documents, leaked to the Independent, concludes that organised criminals were able to infiltrate Scotland Yard 'at will' and access confidential information from secure databases.

The report, written by a team led by Andy Hayman, the force's former assistant commissioner, spoke to informants, used intelligence from intercepted telephone conversations, interviewed officers and scoured old police files to reach its conclusions.

The Metropolitan Police today insisted that the force has 'changed vastly' since the report was completed. But a recently retired senior officer, speaking anonymously to the newspaper, said that: 'The Met is still every bit as corrupt as it was back then.'

Details of the report include a case in which a police statement from a sensitive witness was found in a nightclub controlled by a family of suspected gangsters.

Other records claim that a man on trial for drug trafficking was able to pay officers £15,000 to destroy two 'crucial' surveillance logs. His trial later collapsed.

At another point, a corrupt officer who discovered the existence of a highly sensitive informant was able to threaten his handler with reprisals if he any evidence about organised crime were to emerge.

Another part of the report speaks of a corrupt officer who had 'an ongoing sexual relationship with a female drug supplier', and access police records for her.

Speaking to MailOnline today, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Police suggested that the report was 'outdated' and does not reflect the organisation as it is today.

He said: 'I think everyone recognises that the police has changed vastly over the past five years - let alone the last 10 or 15 years.'

A statement issued by the force also said that the Met continues to investigate corruption, and has 'no complacency' about the matter.

It said: 'The dedicated Anti-Corruption Command (ACC), part of the Met's Directorate of Professional Standards, proactively investigates any allegations or intelligence relating to either corrupt police officers and staff and those that may seek to corrupt our officers or staff. 'All such allegations and intelligence are taken extremely seriously and any any lessons learnt from resulting investigations are used to further our efforts to reduce the likelihood of such offences occurring in the future.'There is no complacency in the Met's determination to succeed in this task and the work of the officers and staff of the ACC is undertaken relentlessly and determinably, fully recognising that criminals who seek to corrupt our officers and staff will remain a threat.'
