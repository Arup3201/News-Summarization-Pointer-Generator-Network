A group of fishermen in Townsville, Queensland, got a nasty surprise when a crocodile surfaced and stole their catch off the end of the line.

The men appeared to have hooked a barramundi and were reeling it in when the massive mass of sharp teeth and scale got the jump on them.

Thrilled with the seeming size of their catch, one of the fisherman is heard saying 'he's a good fish, mate' to another man off camera.

'Did you get it yet, Dad?' Sean Evans, who filmed the catch, can be heard asking just seconds before the dinosauric creature made its entrance.

With one swift swipe the croc had knicked the catch from the fishermen, who were left to marvel at their close encounter, and be thankful they hadn't been hanging a limb over the edge of the boat within biting range.

The video ends with the croc having swam away to eat its dinner, when one of the fisherman asks 'where's my barra?'

It's safe to say these guys will always fish with a long-line from now on.
