Where is she? 16-year-old Layton Stone disappeared on August 22 while walking home from a friend's house 

Police are searching for a 16-year-old who disappeared last week, leaving behind her seizure medication.

Layton Stone disappeared while walking home from a friend's house around 4:30pm on August 22.

She planned to stop and chat with another friend on her way home, but never appeared.

Family do not believe she ran away.

She did not have any money or identification on her, nor did she had the medication she takes every day to prevent seizures.

Layton and her family had recently moved to Kansas City from York, South Carolina.

She was looking forward seeing her boyfriend next week at his graduation from U.S. Air Force basic training in San Antonio.

Layton is described as 5-foot-4 inches tall, 115 pounds with reddish-brown hair that was pulled back into a ponytail the last time she was seen.

She has dark brown eyes, olive complexion and a birthmark in the shape of lips on her right forearm.

She was last seen wearing a navy-blue Guy Harvey shirt, plaid Hollister shorts and brown Rainbow flip-flops.

Anyone with information on Layton's disappearance is asked to call 911, Kansas City police, or the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

Without a trace: Layton went missing on this stretch of suburban road around 4:30pm on August 22

Search: Layton's parents don't believe she ran away. They say she did not have her seizure medication when she went missing

Plans: Layton was looking forward to visiting her boyfriend next week in Texas, at his graduation from basic training. Pictured above with someone who appears to be her boyfriend, in a picture posted to Facebook
