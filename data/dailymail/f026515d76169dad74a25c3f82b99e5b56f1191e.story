A teaching assistant who was '8 out of 10 drunk' left a man scarred for life after she smashed a pint glass in his face during a six-hour pub crawl.

Ashleigh Bayliff, 28, lost her temper and lashed out at Phillip Campbell during a row whilst out  celebrating her boyfriend's birthday.

Mr Campbell was hit just above his right eye, causing heavy bleeding from a one-centimetre gash. He also suffered four other cuts on his forehead.

In the run-up to the attack Bayliff, from Burnley, Lancashire, had been drinking in seven pubs and was being verbally loud and aggressive. She later told police that on a drunkenness scale of one to 10, she was 'eight.'

At Burnley Crown Court, Bayliff admitted wounding and was given an eight-month sentence, suspended for a year, with a 12-week curfew.

Bayliff was also ordered to pay £750 compensation at £100 a month and a £100 victim surcharge. 

She is currently suspended from her job as a teaching assistant at the Hendon Brook School in Nelson, Lancashire, and may now lose her employment.

The court had heard that the incident occurred on July 5 last year after Bayliff went out with friends to celebrate her partner Danny Simpkin's 33rd birthday.

Engineer Mr Campbell, 31, a close friend of Mr Simpkin, was also amongst the party, some of whom had been out from at least 5pm.

David Clarke, prosecuting said 'a lot of drink had been consumed by some, if not all of them' and they had been to six pubs before arriving at the Bridge Beer House in Burnley.

Mr Campbell - who was with his girlfriend Lianna Akbar, 29 - had himself drunk eight pints of lager and the group were all about to leave when the incident, which was caught on CCTV, happened, the court heard.

Mr Clarke said the victim recalled a conversation with Bayliff about why she did not get on with Miss Akbar.

In a statement to police, Mr Campbell said Bayliff was 'drunk and being verbally loud and aggressive'.

The court heard the group had visited six pubs and were in their seventh when Bayliff unleashed the attack

The prosecutor added: 'His next recollection is her swinging a tall glass in her hand to the right side of his face, striking him just above his right eye, smashing the glass in his face. He was bleeding heavily.'

The victim went to hospital after suffering a one centimetre cut and four smaller cuts on his forehead. Bayliff was later arrested at home and claimed she had been attacked.

The prosecutor said Bayliff maintained the conversation had become heated and both had been verbally aggressive to each other. She already had received a caution for battery from 2007.

In his impact statement, Mr Campbell said following the attack he had stayed away from social gatherings with his friends in case Bayliff turned up.

In mitigation defence counsel Hugh McKee said Bayliff was of 'exemplary good character' and added: 'She is still at a loss to understand how it is that it came to this. They were clearly talking at cross purposes.'

Mr McKee added: 'She accepts she lost control of her temper. It's very short-lived, it can perhaps even be described as momentary.

'Mr Campbell can be seen pointing his finger very close to her face and obviously that's when the defendant says he was being abusive to her. But, she has to accept responsibility for what she did and she does.

'Obviously, this matter had affected her life to a very, very great extent. She is suspended from her job and her social life has changed completely.

'One struggles to see how she will maintain that employment, although that decision has not yet been made. Obviously, if she doesn't keep it, she doesn't know what she will do.

'There will be no repetition.There will be no further offending. She understands if she escapes custody, it may be by the skin of her teeth.'

Passing sentence, Judge Jonathan Gibson said: 'I am quite satisfied this was an isolated incident and unlikely to be repeated. But people who cause injury with glasses in public houses generally receive custodial sentences, because, of course, that is conduct that needs to be prevented and discouraged, if at all possible.'
