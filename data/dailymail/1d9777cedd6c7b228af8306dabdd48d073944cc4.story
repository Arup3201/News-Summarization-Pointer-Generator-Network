A 29-year-old Florida woman who was charged as a teen with strangling her newborn child has died, according to police.

Weiss made national news when she was accused at age 17 of strangling her newborn after giving birth to the baby boy in a bathroom and then disposing of the infant's body in a canal

Aimee Lee Weiss of Broward County died on Oct. 24 after ‘complaining about pain in her back and her heart started racing,’ family members told the Miami Herald.

A medical examiner is performing an autopsy on her body to determine the cause of death. 

Weiss made national news when she was accused at age 17 of strangling her newborn after giving birth to the baby boy in a bathroom and then disposing of the infant’s body in a canal.

She was charged with first-degree murder in the baby’s death in 2001 and the case dragged on until 2006, when she pleaded no contest to manslaughter charges.

Weiss claimed that she didn’t strangle the boy, but that she thought the baby died during birth and that’s why she dumped his body in a canal.

She received a sentence in 2006 of three years’ probation in the case. 

Shortly after she was charged with first-degree murder in 2001, Weiss became pregnant again and gave birth to a daughter who is now 10 years old and living with her paternal grandparents, Pam and Jim Walpole, in Texas.

Weiss’ parental rights were terminated by the state of Florida as soon as the girl was born, although Weiss was permitted to nurse the baby for six months under the supervision of the Walpoles.

Jim Walpole told the Miami Herald that Weiss’ daughter would learn of her mother’s death in a counseling session.

The girl was hopeful that one day she would be able to meet her mother, Walpole said.

‘She would say, “I can’t wait till I’m 18 so I can be with Aimee,”’ Walpole told the newspaper.

‘The last time Aimee was with the baby was New Year’s Eve 2002,’ he said. ‘She was so happy, and the baby loved her.

I promised [Aimee] I would do everything I possibly could to give [the baby] everything she couldn’t.’

Weiss was arrested once again in 2007 on charges of insurance fraud while she was still on probation for her newborn’s death.

She was accused of defrauding patients at a chiropractor’s office where she worked.

Her lawyers argued that Weiss was unaware of the scheme her employer was running and she received a seven-day sentence along with a $614.61 fine.

Weiss was arrested a third time in 2010 and charged with prostitution and lewdness.

The case was ongoing when she died.
