However, 39-year-old Hooks came back for the Ferrari and snatched it the next day 'at approximately 3 a.m.,' Guzman-Hurtado said in the release.

Hooks was spotted by police in the Ferrari in Los Angeles' Studio City last Thursday, according to Guzman-Hurtado. He was charged on four separate counts, including theft and unlawful taking or driving of a vehicle.

'We have our undercover detectives working on this situation,' Guzman-Hurtado told The New York Daily News. 'They were able to track him down in Studio City, north of Los Angeles.'

'This guy was running and he did not see the officer around the corner who had a gun pointed and ran right into it and fell,' she told the newspaper. 'It's one of those things you wouldn't believe until you see it.' 

Guzman-Hurtado told MailOnline Hooks is from Studio City and the vehicle is a 2014 Ferrari 485 Spider. 

The Press-Enterprise reported that Hooks allegedly stole a car two years ago.
