They were known as an unsmiling and stuffy couple, so the tone of their letters written to those below them is hardly surprising.

Royal servant Jean Barlerin was sent notes from King George V and Queen Mary complaining about some of the food served up to them.

And the letters have been revealed in his amusing archive detailing the domestic life of the Royal household during the early 20th century.

One note stated: ‘The plain rolls on board Britannia yesterday for tea were very tough.’ Another read: ‘The King & Queen do not want any more of these biscuits ordered as they do not like them.’

One of the 60 scraps of paper kept by Mr Barlerin included a bizarre exchange about the provenance of marmalade served to the Duke of Connaught - the third son of Queen Victoria.

Queen Mary wrote: ‘The Duke of Connaught would like to have the address of the place from which the Orange Marmalade comes’.

The dutiful reply that was typed by Mr Barlerin stated: ‘Golden Shred Marmalade/ J. Robertson & Sons,/ Paisley./ is supplied here by Chivers Brothers, 13 King Street, Aberdeen’.

The notes show the attitude of the Royals towards their servants and also reveal how the Royal household attempted to be frugal during and after the First World War.

Jean Barlerin MVO was the Comptroller of Supply at the Treasurer's Office of the Household of the King between 1910 and 1934.

'The plain rolls on board Britannia yesterday for tea were very tough'

One such selfless note from King George V stated: ‘Saturday. Minced Chicken for lunch, / Sunday Boiled Chicken for lunch. A small piece off the breast.. Don't send up a whole bird.’

Another from the future George VI, read: ‘In future I do not require the fingers of bread for lunch or dinner. For breakfast I only require 2 pieces./ Albert.’

Other notes include a memo from the Queen: ‘The Bacon a little too much cooked & rather hard/ The cakes bought locally were not especially good, we really do not want any & can manage with egg or tomato sandwiches & oatmeal bis-cuits.’

Royalty: King George V and Queen Mary in 1919. One note stated: 'The plain rolls on board Britannia yesterday for tea were very tough'

One quintessentially-English note stated: ‘Tea for 7 in the cricket pavilion for those playing at tennis - Tea - not coffee - Loaf of Bread - butter - Jam - Cake - Biscuits.’

'The Duke of Connaught would like to have the address of the place from which the Orange Marmalade comes'

Another example includes: ‘The Bath buns were very good when sent to Windsor last Friday but yesterday they were again not good - they tasted too much of brioche not bread.’

The archive is now being sold by auctioneers Bonhams.

Matthew Haley from Bonhams said: ‘These are rare survivors and act as a window into the Royal household, and show it to be very “Downton Abbey”.

‘They were kept by the Comptroller of 
Supply at the Treasurer's Office of the Household and show how the 
family treated the staff.

‘They were little orders, but also included slight chastisements, for example if the bread rolls were too hard or they didn't like the biscuits.

‘Unlike most manuscripts, where the issue at stake is their historical importance, this group is unashamedly ephemeral - written, often on small scraps of paper that should have been thrown away.

‘They have immediacy that more august historical records so often lack, and we have a significant quantity here.’

Other papers in the lot include thank-you notes for contributions to royal charities, menu cards and seating plans.

The archive is going under the hammer at Bonhams in London on March 19 with an estimate of £1,000.
