A huge hedgehog is causing her rescuers a prickly problem - by refusing to leave her favourite food and return to the wild.

Edinburgh the hedgehog was put on a strict diet in July last year after tipping the scales at more than 5lbs - more than double the average weight of an fully-grown hedgehog.

The rescued hog soon shed half her body weight through the healthkick at her temporary home in Fife.

Edinburgh, who was named after the place she was rescued, is almost double the size of an average adult hedgehog - thanks to her diet of mealworms

Edinburgh has refused to return to the wild because she doesn't want to leave the diet of mealworms that she is given at her rescuer's home in Fife

But now Edinburgh has got a little too comfortable with her diet of mealworms - and is refusing to return to the wild.

Despite being released in time for spring, the hedgehog has so far stayed put at her charity boss Sandy Boyd’s garden in Wormit, Fife, preferring to stay and snack on mealworms.

And now her weight has slowly crept back up to a hefty 3lbs - more than the 2lb average for an adult hog.

Edinburgh, named after the place where she was rescued, weighed just 400g - less than 1lb - when she arrived at Wormit Hedgehog Care Centre in the autumn of 2012.

But her love of fatty mealworms meant her weight soared until she could not properly roll up to defend herself.

With the arrival of spring, and Edinburgh's new svelte figure, Mr Boyd decided the time was right to release Edinburgh, along with four other rescued hedgehogs, back into the wild.

Edinburgh managed to slim down to around 2lbs, pictured above, but the weight has now crept on since the hedgehog has refused to leave home

November 2012 -  0.8lbs (415g)

June 2013 - 4.8lbs (2182g)

July 2013 - 4.5lbs (2079g)

October 2013 - 2.8lbs (1296g)

February 2014 - 2.4lbs (1127g)

March - 2.9lbs (1356g)

But while the other four hogs went off to explore when released into the garden, Edinburgh stayed put.

He said: 'We released her out in the back garden three weeks ago.

'Edinburgh has decided to stick around though and is staying in one of the special boxes we have for wild hogs in the garden.

'She’s even making herself right at home by taking the straw out the others and moving it to hers. She’s well and truly tucked in.'

Mr Boyd said the lure of her favourite snack was one of the reasons Edinburgh stayed around - and is now contributing to her weight gain.

He said: 'We do keep little bowls of mealworms under the shed and we’ve watched her going under there for a good feed.

'We will have to watch and restrict the mealworms again. It’s likely she’s going to be sticking around and will probably be back with us next winter for hibernation.'
