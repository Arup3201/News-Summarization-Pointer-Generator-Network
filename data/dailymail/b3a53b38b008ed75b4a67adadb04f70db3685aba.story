A father left his two-year-old daughter in a hot locked car in the parking lot of a  Long Island shopping center while he indulged in some retail therapy inside.

Melvin Marroquin, 30, was shopping with his parents on Thursday afternoon while his toddler daughter sweltered inside his Nissan Frontier pick where the temperature reached 120 degrees.

A shopper heard her cries and noticed the little girl locked in the car with the windows wound up and called police to rescue her around 12:40pm.

Near tragedy: Melvin Marroquin admitted to police that he left his toddler daughter in his locked pickup at the height of Thursday's heat for 25 minutes

Upsetting: Police officers Aaron Klein and Derek Mangi smashed the car window and pulled the toddler from the car. They said she was extremely hot to the touch and her hair was plastered to her head and shoulders with sweat

When police arrived, the girl was suffering serious heat exhaustion.

'She was beet red, and there were drips of sweat just coming off of her face and she looked to be in a lot of pain and agony at that time,' police officer Aaron Klein told NBC New York. 'It was beyond hot inside that car.'

Officers had to break the window to get her out of the car, by which time she was lethargic and couldn't speak.

Officer 
Derek Mangi said it was 'very upsetting holding her and feeling hot how 
she was. It was scary,' adding that the child would almost certainly 
have died if they hadn't rescued her.

They rushed her to an air-conditioned store nearby and gave her water to drink.

Shopping spree: Marroquin and his parents shopped at Marshall's in Huntington as his little girl was sitting in her car-seat in his locked pickup in 120-degree heat

Facing the heat: Melvin Marroquin faced a judge Friday morning and was charged with reckless endangerment and child endangerment charges

Marroquin emerged from the store laden with shopping bags 10 minutes after police had rescued his daughter from the heat.

He and his family are visiting Long Island from their home in Maryland and had spent the day with various family members and five children, he told police.

Marroquin initially told the officers that he had forgotten his daughter was in the car, before admitting that he'd left the girl there for 25 minutes while he shopped.

Marroquin has been arrested for child endangerment and reckless endangerment. It's unclear if his parents, the little girl's grandparents, were aware that she was in the car.  

She was taken to Huntington Hospital with heat exhaustion before being released into the custody of her mother.
