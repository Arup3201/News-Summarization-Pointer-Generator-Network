Two Victorian police officers found themselves operating slightly outside of their job description this morning when a woman in labour arrived at the station for assistance.

Constable Laura Wood and Senior Constable Peter Evans quickly rushed to the assistance of the woman who had entered her final stages of labour en route to the hospital.

The woman's husband and toddler son looked on as the woman gave birth in the middle of the station car park, much to the surprise of the assisting officers.

Sergeant Max Walker said that the officers had just started their morning shift when the woman came in.

Surprised Victorian Police constables delivered a baby girl this morning at Springvale Police Station

'This is an unusual event, but a nice way to start the day,' said Sergeant Walker.

'The woman had been screaming at her husband to pull over, telling him that the baby was coming now,'

'I've been doing this job for 36 years, and while this kind of thing happens every now and then, it's not normally happening at the actual station,'

'It's nice to do something positive to assist the local community'.

Sergeant Walker said that Constable Wood and Senior Constable Evans were a bit shocked when the woman came in, but their training quickly kicked in. 

The officers quickly sprung into action to help deliver the baby girl

'They went straight into training mode,' said Sergeant Walker.

'We're all qualified in Senior First Aid, and of course they took into account the welfare of the mother and child.'

The baby girl was delivered via a normal birth but was found not to be breathing. 

'We offered reassurance to the mother, and had Melbourne Ambulance Service on the phone,'

'They were excellent and provided all the instructions the constables needed to help her.' 

The baby girl and her mother were taken to Dandenong Hospital for monitoring

The constables checked the baby's airways and the girl was soon breathing.

An ambulance arrived from Monash Health and the mother and her new baby girl were taken to Dandenong Hospital for monitoring.

Victorian Police have dealt with a similar situation before in the rural town of Ferntree Gully.

In 1997 Jacqui Walker's son Connor was born at the Mooroolbark Police Station when she was sent home from the hospital after being induced at about midnight.

'After dropping off my daughter to my mothers house, I insisted on continuing on to hospital which was about 25 minutes away,' Ms. Walker said.

'My mother begged me to stay and offered to call and ambulance but I was in second stage labour and only focused on getting to hospital,'

'When I passed the police station in Mooroolbark, I needed to push so I yelled to my husband that he needed to pull over. The police station was the only thing open at 2am!'

Ms. Walker  had four police officers helping her through the stressful process, for which she is incredibly thankful.

'I had some stroking my hair and saying reassuring words, and others ready for action. Gloves and a blanket came out and I would have been there less than five minutes before my son was born in the car. The ambulance arrived about five minutes later and we went on to the hospital,' she said.

'I saw on the news the next day how absolutely chuffed the officers were at being involved in the birth of my son. I am forever grateful to them'. 

While babies decide when and where they will come, Sergeant Walker was certainly not expecting one on his shift. 

'I've seen a lot of things in my years,' said Sergeant Walker.

'But nothing like this. Nobody to my knowledge has ever given birth at the station before'. 

The baby girl and her mother have been reported to be doing well and resting normally.
