Alexis Sanchez fired anxious Arsenal into a 17th successive Champions League campaign before Arsene Wenger claimed his £30million Chilean can lead the line until the end of the year in the absence of Olivier Giroud.

Sanchez struck just before half-time with his first goal since his transfer from Barcelona and the Londoners clung to their lead despite finishing the game with 10 men after Mathieu Debuchy was sent off.

Wenger confirmed striker Giroud had surgery on a broken ankle on Wednesday and will be out for up to four months but resisted the clamour to make an emergency dash into the transfer market.

Main man: Alexis Sanchez scored the only goal of the game as Arsenal beat Besiktas to reach the group stage

Opening his account: Sanchez scored his first goal for Arsenal since his £30million move from Barcelona

'Sanchez can play his whole life at centre-forward,' said the Arsenal boss. 'I bought him as a striker, not only to play on the flanks. He had a good game. He was mobile, dangerous and has shown as well he has great fighting spirit, qualities that will be very important in the Premier League.

'He produced the performance we wanted, technically, tactically and mentally. We needed that against a good team. It was nervous in the last 10 minutes when we were down to 10 men.'

As for Giroud, Wenger added: 'He had surgery for a broken tibia. He be out of action for three to four months and will be capable of playing again in the Premier League by the end of December. You will ask me straight away who we will buy and I say: At the moment, no one.

'I know if you want to make anybody happy you should just buy all these players, but what is important is the performance on the pitch, and the solidarity we have shown tonight.

'If you look at the players on the bench and those injured, you will know we have players. You cannot just buy when a player is injured.'

Blow: Olivier Giroud will be out until at least the end of the year after breaking his ankle against Everton

Patient: Giroud watched Arsenal's victory from the comfort of his home as he recovers from surgery

He rejected the idea of a swoop for Radamel Falcao from Monaco or Daniel Welbeck from Manchester United and rejected claims by the agent of Nikola Zigic that he wanted to recruit the former Birmingham striker.

'Who?' said Wenger, when asked about Zigic. 'Zigic? No.'

Instead, he applauded the spirit of his team, having finished both legs of the play-off with 10 men. Aaron Ramsey as dismissed in the first leg in Istanbul, and Debuchy last night for two bookings.

'Debuchy went for the ball and played the ball,' said Wenger, who also admitted his team were lucky not to conceded a penalty for a tackle by Jack Wilshere. 'There was no intention to make a bad foul or stop the counter-attack. And he won the ball.

'Maybe the referee was on the other side of the player and thought he made a foul, but we dealt with it. Nervously, it was very difficult. But we dealt with it.'

Besiktas boss Slaven Bilic congratulated Arsenal but fears they do not have a genuine chance of winning the Champions League. 'Football is a very strange sport but I don't think so,' said Bilic. 'They are far away from the big guns.'

No go: Arsenal had been linked with a move for Monaco striker Radamel Falcao

No thanks: Arsene Wenger ruled out signing former Birmigham striker Nicola Zigic
