She's just days from giving birth but even impending motherhood couldn't keep Zara Phillips away from her beloved horses.

The Olympic silver medallist was on hand to monitor her equine charges as they were put through their paces during the Heythrop Hunt Point-to-Point races in Gloucestershire.

The 32-year-old, whose first child is due this month, was later spotted making her way through the paddock to a vantage point on the sidelines and watched intently as her runners flashed past.

Not long now: Zara Phillips makes her way through the paddock at the Heythrop Hunt Point-to-Point

Ready to pop: The 32-year-old royal is just days away from the birth of her first child

Wrapped in a cosy parka, complete with a fashionably furry hood, the fresh-faced mother-to-be appeared less than impressed with their performance but still managed to summon up a smile for the watching crowds. 

Although rugby player husband Mike Tindall was nowhere to be seen, the royal wasn't short of company and was seen laughing and joking with friends during gaps in the programme.

Phillips, who is a trainer in addition to being a successful eventer, had three horses entered for the event, among them, the hotly tipped Devils Boy [sic] who appeared in the first race of the day.

Other entries included Calusa Comet, a six-year-old Irish bay, and Fiddle Faddle, a horse owned by her mother, The Princess Royal.

Oh no! Miss Phillips appeared less than impressed with the performance of her trio of horses

Cosy: Mrs Brooks and her one-year-old daughter Scarlett were both well wrapped up against the January chill

And Ms Phillips wasn't the only notable name to appear at the event. Also watching the races was former News International boss, Rebekah Brooks.

Mrs Brooks, who along with David Cameron has previously turned out to hunt with the Heythrop, was seen watching from the sidelines, her daughter Scarlett in her arms.

Despite looking pale, perhaps as a result of the ongoing phone-hacking trial, Mrs Brooks brightened up her look with a jaunty orange scarf, which she wore with a cosy padded jacket and a pair of tweed breeks.

Elegant: The Queen plumped for a chic turquoise ensemble but once again refused to accept posies

While Princess Anne was nowhere to be seen, despite having a horse entered in the races, another royal to brave the cold was the Queen, who was seen arriving at St Mary Magdalene church in Sandringham this morning for the Sunday service.

Much to the surprise of onlookers, the Queen, who was colourfully dressed in a turquoise ensemble, once more refused to accept flowers from waiting children, and left the honours to a lady-in-waiting.

By contrasts, the Duke of Edinburgh was in fine fettle and beamed at well-wishers as he arrived at the village church on foot.

With a new great grandson or daughter just days away, the Duke could have something else to smile about come next Sunday.  

Good spirits: The Duke of Edinburgh was on fine form as he walked with members of the Royal Household

Not stopping: After the service, the Queen was driven away in a maroon Bentley without collecting flowers
