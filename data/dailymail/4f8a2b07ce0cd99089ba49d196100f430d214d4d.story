A source close to the singer told the Sunday Mirror: 'Rebecca is absolutely shocked by it. Obviously her first thought is for the children who are still a big part of Karl and his family’s lives.

'Rebecca always puts their welfare first. Her priority is to make sure they’re safe and that they feel secure at all times.'

The men were still recovering in hospital last night, while Miss Ferguson was on tour in Cologne, Germany.

Police arrested two men and a woman over the shooting, in the Everton district of Liverpool.

Miss Ferguson, 27, met Mr Dures on a 2003 holiday to Tenerife, years before she appeared on the X Factor in 2010, where she was the series's runner-up.

Representatives for Miss Ferguson are yet to respond to requests for comment.
