The former Legion Cabs depot made headlines last year when fashion boss Danny Avidan splashed $18 million on the site in Sydney's inner-city Surry Hills.

And now potential buyers have been granted their first look at the new 53-apartment development on Foveaux Street, with the stylish complex having its first open over the weekend.

When it's completed in two years The Foveaux will be five stories and boast an impressive 850 sq m rooftop garden overlooking the city.

CBRE Residential director Caroline Fagerlund said the development had attracted a lot of interest.

'We had our first open and it was very good, we had over 200 groups through on the weekend,' Ms Fagerlund told Daily Mail Australia.

Kris Smith and Maddy King are among the prospective buyers

Among prospective buyers is TV host and model Kris Smith and his girlfriend Maddy King, The Daily Telegraph reported.

'We need a new place to live. They look beautiful, I'm excited to see them for real,' Smith told the Telegraph.

'It's a great spot.'

The development will include one, two and three-bedroom apartments that will sell at starting prices of $780,000, $995,000 and $1.75 million respectively.

Ms Fagerlund described the design as modern but natural.

'The exterior of the building is material like timber and concrete with some planter boxes,' she said.

'Inside, it's timber floors throughout, they don't have any carpet not even in the bedrooms.'

Architect Adam Haddow said he tried to design a building that would age gracefully.

'It's not a polished, glitzy building you might get on the Harbour,' Mr Haddow told Daily Mail Australia.

'But I suppose the industrial chic thing would have been a bit too easy in a way.

'It's quite comfortable, and there's a texture and a rawness to the material.'

The building will be constructed from off-form concrete in a mottled grey colour.

'It's accented through crisp white boxes and some timber cheeks which add warmth to the building,' Mr Haddow said.

Mr Haddow added that the rooftop garden was designed to give residents space, mentally and physically.

'It's divided into a number of different zones around the rooftop so you can always go up there and find a space for yourself,' he said.

Architect Adam Haddow made an effort not take the easy option to go for an 'industrial chic' design

'It's quite comfortable, and there's a texture and a rawness to the material,' Mr Haddow said

'Because it's such an inner-city site when you get into the density of the city it's nice to give people a place where they can always get access to sun and the sky.

'And you're quite elevated there so you get very amazing views of the CBD.'

The building will also be decorated by an awning, the underside of which will be designed by artist Mika Utzon Popov.

The complex will take two years to build
