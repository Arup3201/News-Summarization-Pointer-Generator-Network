Queen Victoria's relationship with her devoted ghillie John Brown 150 years ago set tongues wagging from the grand hallways of Buckingham Palace to the servants’ quarters at Balmoral.

But while rumours that the pair were lovers endure to this day, a new book claims there was another reason why the pair were so close.

According to author J. H. Brennan, Brown was a medium channelling the spirit of the Queen’s beloved late husband, Prince Albert.

Decades apart: Prince Albert died in 1861 aged 42. Queen Victoria died in 1901 at the age of 81. She is said to have tried to contact her husband through a medium after his death

Brennan, whose book Whisperers examines the impact of spirit contact on the rich and powerful, said: ‘Queen Victoria was fascinated by spiritualism long before Albert’s early death at the age of 42 in 1861. Mediums would visit Buckingham Palace and hold seances.’

As Brown passed messages to and from the deceased Prince Consort, he grew increasingly close to the bereaved Queen.

‘I don’t believe they were lovers, but Victoria had a great affection for Brown,’ said Brennan.

‘People gossiped at the inappropriate
 intimacy, but it wasn’t a sexual relationship. When Brown died in 1883,
 almost two decades before Victoria, she described him as her only true 
friend.’

The ghillie is best remembered today thanks to the acclaimed 1997 film Mrs Brown, starring Dame Judi Dench and Billy Connolly.
