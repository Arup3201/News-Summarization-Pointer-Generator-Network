Antony Fowler is convinced his concussive charge to Commonwealth Games boxing success in Glasgow will help him step out of the shadows of his more famous cousin.

The 23-year-old is related to former Liverpool footballer Robbie but is quickly making a name for himself after rounding off a dominant campaign in the 20,000-capacity Hydro.

Fowler dominated his middleweight final against India's former Olympic bronze medallist Vijender, flooring his opponent on his way to a wide points win.

Easy: A flurry of sharp hooks dumped Vijender on the canvas midway through the opening round

He said: 'I want to be my own man. Football has 11 players but I'm doing it all my own - I'm my own person.'

A flurry of sharp hooks dumped Vijender on the canvas midway through the opening round, with the Indian complaining he had been hit while on the deck.

A right hook on the bell to end the round underlined Fowler's dominance, and although Vijender drew on his experience to drag himself back into the fight his moments of success were too fleeting to seriously threaten to turn the fight around.

The final minute of the third arguably proved Vijender's most successful as he rammed home a straight left, but there was never any doubt that the Liverpool fighter would get the unanimous verdict.

Fowler made no excuses for his combative style which is already stirring the interest of professional promoters although the 23-year-old is intent on crowning his amateur career with gold in Rio in 2016.

Fowler added: 'When I was an 11-year-old boy I saw guys winning the Commonwealth bronze and thought they were superstars - 12 years later I'm here winning gold and I'm so proud of myself.

'I might have looked like I was trying to knock him out but that was me trying to coast - he hit me with some of his big shots and I thought 'no way'.

'It's been nine months work - I didn't drink over Christmas and I was in the gym Christmas Eve. I've had two weeks off since then.

'I was levels above the people here and this is just the start for me - I'm a man on the mission and I'm going to the Olympics.'
