It sounds like a scene from National Lampoon's Animal House: furniture rearranged for drinking games, smell of marijuana all around and over 1,000 empty beer cans.

But, in an unprecedented move, four Boston University students have spent three nights in jail on charges of repeatedly throwing raucous parties at their house in Allston.

Police allege a recent knees-up thrown by the four accused - Michael Oldcorn, 20; John Pavia, 20; Sawyer Petric, 19, and Terry Bartrug, 20 - violated the probation terms they were given following a party in September, which involved more than 200 people.

The groups faced court Friday morning and we released after three nights in jail, however all four kept their faces covered with the hands for the duration of the appearance - even when they were being addressed by Judge David Donnell.

Their dramatic arrests come as police continue to crack down on noise disturbances from parties in the area, with calls of complaint said to have now been halved.

Boston police Sergeant Michael O’Hara told The Boston Globe that officers were left with no choice but to arrest the group after consistent warnings.

'It gets to the point you have to say enough is enough,' he said.

'These kids were given every opportunity, and they blew it.'

The first incident occurred in September, when police were called to the 'animal house' on Linden Street.

Upon their arrival, revelers raced back inside the property and turned off the music and lights.

Once inside, officers said there 200 
people at the house, which was scattered with empty liquor bottles and 
smelled of marijuana.

Jailed: Michael Oldcorn, 20 (left) and John Pavia, 20 (right), along with their two other fraternity brothers, were arrested for allegedly violating their probation and throwing a house party on Tuesday night

Terry Bartrug, 20, was one of four Boston University students charged and jailed after all;allegedly throwing a wild party while on probation. The group were party of the Z.B.T. fraternity

The house, at 85 Linden Street in the Boston suburb of Allston, is one of about 63 on the Boston Police Department's 'Party Call Hotsheet', based on regular noise complaints

The four hosts were given one charge each of keeping a disorderly house.

They were put on pretrial probation, police said, and were told that if they stayed out of trouble, all would be forgiven.

However on January 26 - four months later - they threw a second a party.

Police say doors were slammed and locked in their faces when they arrived at the house at 1am.

Scores of people, many underage, began pouring out of doors and windows.

When police did get in, they found more than 1,000 beer cans.

The four students were arrested, with Judge David Donnelly revoking their bail for violating probation.

The four have been held here, at Nashua Street Jail, since Tuesday, police said. They are expected to go before a judge on Friday

As raucous parties go, O’Hara said these two were in 'the top 10 percent'.

'But they’re not being put in jail for being a keeper of a disorderly house,' he said.

'They’re being put in jail because of the fact that they violated the probation. . . That’s a serious offense. That’s an affront to the court.'

According to the police report, the house was being used by the BU fraternity Z.B.T., Zeta Beta Tau.

However the website, Facebook and Twitter accounts for the fraternity have been disabled.

On Friday it emerged that BU Dean of Students Kenneth Elmore suspended the fraternity, Zeta Beta Tau, because the school believes the Jan. 26 party was part of a recruitment effort by the fraternity and that underage drinking was taking place.

The news coincided with a court appearance by the four, who stood shoulder to shoulder and kept their faces concealed throughout the hearing.

They were released from jail  on personal recognizance, after three nights behind bars, however Judge David Donnelly was was scathing in his statements.

'Their parents have gone to great lengths, great sacrifice, great expense, for these four young men to go to a world-class university,' he said.

The students had learned their lesson and 'manned up', said defense attorney David R. Yannetti, adding that all four were moving out of the house.

Boston University is one of the more expensive colleges in the country, with students paying about $58, 530 per year.

In 2012, O’Hara said, when he took over as community service supervisor at District 14 in Brighton, he and his officers came up with a plan to track houses with lots of complaints.

Terry Bartrug, 20, and his three housemates were charged with keeping a disorderly house in September. After allegedly throwing another party this week, they were arrested

Now, residents who attract loud-party complaints are usually asked to perform 30 hours of community service in the Allston-Brighton area in exchange for dismissal of the complaint.

A second offense, however, will result in partiers going before a judge, said O’Hara.

'The residents who have been affected by these kids like the program,' he said.

'They like to see the kids giving back, instead of just paying a $100 fine and walking out the door. These kids have no problem writing a check.'

The house is one of about 63 on the Boston Police Department’s “Party Call Hotsheet,” O’Hara said, because it regularly receives noise complaints

The Allston-Brighton area, he said, has the highest concentration of college students in the city, and landlords often pack more tenants than are legally allowed into homes to make extra rent money. 

Terry Bartrug, 20, along with his three other frat brothers, were released from jail on Friday morning following a court appearance. They spent three nights behind bars

The unusual circumstances surrounding the jail time brought out a chorus of complaints from students that attend the school.

'It was just a party, won’t be the first, won’t be the last,' one wrote.

'What the heck kind of crime is “keeping a disorderly house”? How did the MA lawyers on the legislature dream up a way to get this charge around the 4th amendment? Is it not my right to keep my house as I desire?' posted another.

'I mean yeah, a college party. Let’s ruin those kids lives. God forbid BU help have responsible parties instead of forcing them underground. You really shouldn’t have any fun while mortgaging your future away.'
