A New York man with a history of drug arrests left his seven-month-old baby boy to die inside a sweltering car where temperatures hit 119 degrees after forgetting he was there, police say.

Devon Fenner, 25, of Hempstead, Long Island, who was found in possession of a small quantity of marijuana, pleaded not guilty at his arraignment to a charge of criminally negligent homicide.

Fenner called 911 at about 1:40pm 
on Tuesday, telling authorities that he had accidentally left his 
son, Dominick, in a car seat inside his 2003 Toyota 
Corolla which was parked outside his house.

He told 
authorities the child had been in the car about 30 minutes before he was
rescued. EMTs tried to perform CPR, but the child died about 40 minutes
later at a nearby hospital, police said.

Fenner faces up to four years in prison if convicted. A judge set bond at $50,000 for Fenner, who has an arrest record for marijuana possession and other crimes.

Inspector Kenneth Lack, a Nassau County police spokesman said investigators found that all the windows were shut except for a small crack in the driver's-side window.

'Unfortunately, cracking a window on a 90-degree day doesn't do much,' Lack said. Temperatures on Long Island on Tuesday were in the middle to high 80s.

Fenner is currently living with the baby's mother, their seven-year-old son and her four-year-old daughter.

Fenner also has an 8-year-old son who lives elsewhere, police said.

His arrest record, which dates to 2004, includes guilty pleas for criminal trespass, marijuana possession and harassment, according to the district attorney's office.

He also has a pending case on a charge of unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle, authorities said.

Inspector Lack said Child Protective Services 
authorities would conduct a separate investigation, but for the moment 
the children were being cared for by their mother.

Police expect additional charges when the case is presented to a grand jury. He is due back in court on Aug. 28.

Fenner's attorney did not immediately return a call for comment.
