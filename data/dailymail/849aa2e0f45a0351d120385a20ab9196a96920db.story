Council bosses have forked out almost £5,000 for a man to walk his pet owl around town - to scare off pigeons.

Oswestry Town Council have been spending £75 a day letting bird enthusiast Harry Hamilton, 61, walk around the town of Oswestry, Shropshire, with his owl Barney in tow, in a bid to scare away pigeons.

Bird of prey enthusiast Harry has been walking around the town with the owl on his arm twice a week, since June 2013 as part of a pigeon deterrent trial.

Coming for you! Barney the owl has been approved by council bosses to scare off the other birds

Harry, who has been keeping birds of prey for the past 25 years, said: 'Usually when I walk around, I rarely see any pigeons.

'People will stop and come and see the owl and it’s great fun getting out and about with him.'

Town councillor Glenys Davies, said: 'We have the same pigeon problem as any other town with flocks gathering on building and in parks.

'We started the trial to try and reduce the problem and we approached Mr Hamilton to see if his owl would make a difference. When he walks around the town, the pigeons are nowhere to be seen.

Councillors are now planning to vote on whether to make the owl walks a permanent feature

'They return to the parks once he has left, but no where near the same amount as before. No birds are harmed, only frightened and we have been paying Harry £75 a day for his services.'

Councillors are now planning to vote on whether to make the owl walks a permanent feature, but it could cost the public almost £8,000 a year.

Jonathan Isaby, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: 'Taxpayers are unlikely to think spending thousands of pounds to scare off pigeons is a wise use of their money.

'The council need to give a hoot about how they spend resident’s money, especially at a time when many people are struggling. Keeping vermin under control is important but it needn’t cost a fortune.'
