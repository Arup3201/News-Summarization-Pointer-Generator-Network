The issue of small fields rears its ugly head again with Saturday's Grade One Tolworth Hurdle attracting just four runners.

Thankfully, there are a couple of decent handicaps on the Sandown card for punters to attack and WILLIAM’S WISHES (Sandown, 1.50) could be the answer to the 32RedSport.com Handicap Chase.

The 10-year-old defends his crown on Saturday having landed the last running of this event two years ago and his two runs this season have indicated he is being primed for a repeat bid.

A tidy comeback behind The New One over hurdles precluded a very fair performance in the Tingle Creek Chase which saw the selection beaten just 14 lengths by Dodging Bullets. While it is dangerous to take that run too literally, it did at least confirm William’s Wishes is in excellent heart and his last two runs in handicaps resulted in two decisive victories, including in this race in 2013.

There looks a good chance of a decent gallop, too, with the likes of Mr Mole and Dance Floor King in opposition and that should aid a horse who traditionally travels strongly.

The likeable L’Ami Serge is likely to be a fairly short-priced conveyance for the Tolworth following a couple of facile victories.

However, there could be some margin in supporting JOLLY’S CRACKED IT (Sandown, 2.25), who has impressed in both his starts this term and may offer a better-value wager. Any overnight rain — there is eight to 10 millimetres forecast — would play to the strengths of Harry Fry’s charge who hails from a yard in rampant form.

Jolly’s Cracked It clearly loves racing right-handed too and, but for a sloppy leap at the final two flights at Ascot last time, would have won considerably more easily.

Connections have had this race in mind for some time, while it appears an after-thought for the favourite and only other serious rival Shelford, who bids to give trainer Harry Skelton his first Grade One winner.

There is some excellent fare on the all-weather and JACK OF DIAMONDS (Lingfield, nap, 1.25) could trump his rivals in the mile handicap.

A narrow defeat of the talented Razor Wind over course and distance reads well in the context of today’s event and Malaysian Boleh, who was back in eighth, was only narrowly touched off on Wednesday at a big price.

The stop-start nature of a four-runner conditions race didn’t suit last time and Jack Of Diamonds should go well back in a handicap on Saturday.

CASTILO DEL DIABLO (Lingfield, nb, 2.00) was another undone by a sluggish gallop last time and appears a fair bet to go a couple better with some front-runners in opposition Saturday afternoon.
