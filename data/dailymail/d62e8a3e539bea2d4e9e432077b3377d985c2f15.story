A fraudster who tried to smuggle drugs into prison for her convict boyfriend has joined him behind bars after police caught her with £700 worth of heroin stuffed inside her bra.

Officers found the Class A drug in Stacey Martin's underwear after they stopped her car in Wolverhampton on April 7 last year.

Detectives believe the heroin had been destined for Martin's partner Andrew Warley, as they had managed to foil a similar plot devised by the pair only two days earlier.

Martin, 32, had hidden a £360 wrap of skunk cannabis in a packet of crisps in bushes outside Ranby Prison in Nottinghamshire.

The plan was that a fellow inmate on litter-picking duty would collect the packet and smuggle it inside for Warley, who was serving time for dangerous driving.

But police got their first and replaced the packet with another containing fake drugs.

Martin, of Penn, Wolverhampton, was jailed for two years when she appeared at Wolverhampton Crown Court on Friday.

She admitted two counts of conspiracy to supply drugs, as well as a conspiracy to commit fraud after police found she had staged a carjacking in an attempt to claim cash on her insurance.

Warley was jailed for four and a half years after he admitted the same three charges and a further count of perverting the course of justice.

The court heard that the first offence was the carjacking plot, which happened on March 26 last year.

Witnesses reported seeing Martin pulling into a petrol station in Wolverhampton in a BMW convertible worth almost £40,000, only for two men to rush at her, snatch the keys and drive away.

The insurance company did not pay out, and police uncovered the plot when it became clear that Martin had put down a £25,405 cash deposit for the car when she had no obvious income.

The crisp packet conspiracy happened on April 5 last year, when Martin was seen pulling into a car park outside Ranby Prison.

A male associate was then seen to place the crisp packet beneath a tree.

The next morning, detectives watched in secret as an inmate on litter-picking duty headed straight to the tree, scooped up the crisp packet and placed it in a bin bag.

Ignoring other rubbish on the floor, he went straight back to the prison gate but was arrested at the entrance.

Martin was driving the Fiesta again two days later when she was stopped by police.

Officers searched the car, but only found the drugs when they arrived at a police station and Martin admitted: 'I've got it in my bra - half of brown.'

Detective Constable Lee Price, of West Midlands Police’s Organised Crime Unit, said: 'The pair were clearly planning ways of getting drugs inside prison and also hatching plans to make almost £40,000 by staging a robbery of Martin's BMW convertible.

'Detectives became aware of their scheme, though, and both are now paying the penalty.

'Police, prison and the courts view criminality behind bars very seriously and anyone caught trying to convey drugs, phones or other contraband into jail faces a jail term of up to 10 years.'
