An electronic cigarette advert featuring the slogan 'Love Your Lungs' has been banned for implying they were beneficial to users' health.

Watchdogs launched an investigation into the LeoLites poster campaign after receiving a complaint it suggested
that there was evidence the e-cigarettes were not harmful.

Manufacturers E&L Distribution argued there was no health claim being made as the advert did not state that the products would improve users’ health or benefit the health of their lungs.

Banned: This LeoLites advert has been banned for implying its e-cigarettes were beneficial to users' health

They added that they had wanted the slogan to be catchy, alliterative and relevant to both the product and the action of inhaling vapour into the lungs. 

However, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) found the advert to be in breach of its rules regarding misleading advertising and substantiation and banned it from being used again.

An ASA spokesman said: 'Within the context of the ad, we considered that consumers, particularly those who were existing smokers, were likely to interpret the claim "Love Your Lungs" as meaning that LeoLites e-cigarettes contained properties that were not harmful to their lungs or that they would experience an improvement in the health of their lungs if they used LeoLites products.'

Ruling: Watchdogs also concluded that the advert could suggest that LeoLite products were less harmful to users' lungs than traditional cigarettes (pictured) or other brands of e-cigarettes

The spokesman added that the advert could suggest that LeoLites products were less harmful to users' lungs than traditional cigarettes or other brands of e-cigarettes.

He said: 'We also considered that the claim could also be interpreted to mean that consumers should "love their lungs" by switching from traditional cigarettes, or, given the inclusion of the phrase "e-cigarettes have evolved", from other brands of e-cigarettes to LeoLites products. 

'The wording of the ad suggested a comparison between using LeoLites products and traditional cigarettes or other brands of e-cigarettes, that implied LeoLites products were less harmful to users’ lungs. 

'We noted that we had not seen any evidence to demonstrate that LeoLites products were beneficial to the health of users’ lungs or that the products were less harmful than traditional cigarettes or other brands of e-cigarettes, as implied in the ad.

'On this basis, we considered the claim "love your lungs" had not been substantiated and concluded the ad was misleading.'

He added: 'We told LeoLites to ensure that they did not use the claim "love your lungs" or make any claims that implied their products were not harmful or were beneficial to the health of users’ lungs in future ads, unless they held robust evidence to substantiate the claims.'

A LeoLites spokesman said today: 'It was never the intention of LeoLites to make a health claim with the slogan "Love your lungs". It was an alliterative tagline that was intended to grab attention, and the obvious connotations associated with Lungs and vaping.

'We apologise if there was any confusion about this message, as that was never our intention.

'We will continue to sell our products in an aim to help people switch from smoking tobacco. In future we will try to ensure any advertising campaigns will be less ambiguous to the public.'
