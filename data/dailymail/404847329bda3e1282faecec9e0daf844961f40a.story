A McDonald's manager was arrested and cautioned over a foul-mouthed racist tirade against Somali customers.

The victims of his abuse say he told them to 'get the f*** out of my restaurant,' adding: 'All you f****** Somalians are the same.' 

Yasin Farah, 27, and friends went to the restaurant in south east London, for breakfast at 5.30am on Sunday November 2 following a night out.

He said the manager of the restaurant, who is understood to be black and  had a West African accent, quickly turned on him and four friends.

Mr Farah, of Penge, said: 'When it came to us being served the manager jumped on the till and straight away was aggressive with us.

'He was saying to my friend: "Can you not read, can you not see? What do you want for your breakfast?"

'I didn't understand why he was asking if he could read, so I jumped in and starting saying "just let him order his breakfast".

'Then he started telling us to get the f*** out of the restaurant. I thought: "How can you talk to a paying customer like that?"'

At this point things took an even more unpleasant turn.

Mr Farah said: 'Then all of a sudden he says I am a low-life.

'He says: "You are a low-life, get out of the restaurant, all you f****** Somalians are all the same".

'A lot of his colleagues were coming in, trying to calm him down.

'The customers were shocked, his response was completely out of proportion.'

'His actions, his mannerisms, the way he was saying the things he said, made me want to take action.

'I called the police. At the end of the day he's the manager, you cannot set that kind of example. No one is allowed to speak to anyone like that in today's society.'

A McDonald's spokeswoman said: 'We are aware of the incident and are working with the individual and restaurant team to ensure this never happens again.

'All are aware of the severity of this and are following internal HR processes.'

A police spokesman said: 'Police were called to an allegation of racially aggravated harassment at McDonald's at 5.50am on Sunday November 2.

'A 41-year-old man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of a racially aggravated offence under section four of the Public Order Act. He was subsequently issued with a police caution.'
