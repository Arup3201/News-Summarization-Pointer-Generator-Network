Battle-hardened jihadists who have fought alongside extremist Al Qaeda-linked rebels in Syria's civil war are returning to live among us in Europe, the EU's anti-terror chief has warned.

The number of fighters travelling back and forth from war-torn country is increasing, stressed guidance prepared by the office of EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator Gilles de Kerchove.

Drawn by recruiters who arrange travel and accommodation, these men are learning to fight, being indoctrinated with the tenets of militant Islam, and could pose a potent threat once back home.

Moreover, Syrian rebels are often seen as heroes to a small section of youths upon return, making them ideal to further foster recruitment, warns a note prepared for a meeting of EU interior ministers today.

The note, seen by The Associated Press, specifically calls for better use of airline passenger information available to security officials to keep track of when and how rebels move to Syria.

But a new law that could make it easier to share information remains stuck in the European Parliament while MEPs debate the wholesale snooping on EU citizens revealed by U.S. whistleblower Edward Snowden.

The 11 western European countries with the biggest contingents in Syria are estimated to have some 1,200-1,700 citizens among rebel forces, according to government and analyst figures compiled by the Associated Press.

That compares to estimates of 600-800 from those countries in late spring. 'There are cases where individuals continue travelling back and forth,' the note for the ministers said.

Belgian Interior Minister Joelle 
Milquet organized an international gathering on the subject with a dozen
 counterparts on the eve of the EU meeting.

'We
 have to anticipate the returns (of fighters from Syria), the ways to 
handle this, the prevention measures and especially the exchange of 
information on the travels,' she said.

The head of MI5, the UK's domestic spying agency, last month said 'low hundreds of people' had travelled from Britain to Syria and that some have since returned - stoking fears extremists could pose a domestic threat.

Some of them, said Britain's counter-terror chief Helen Ball on Wednesday, 'decided to get themselves trained to use weapons or build bombs and engage in fighting'

'They are not some romantic freedom fighters,' said Ms Ball.

EU interior ministers will also be looking at ways to cooperate more closely with Turkey, Syria's neighbour, through which most of the fighters move to get join with Syrian rebel units.

'The EU should offer to assist Turkey in improving controls at borders and airports and should do more to help in preventing radicalisation of individuals, especially in refugee camps,' the note said.

The Mail On Sunday revealed last weekend how one British man who was killed fighting alongside Al Qaeda-linked extremists in Syria funded his trip by mugging people in an affluent area of London.

Choukri Ellekhlifi, 22, threatened victims with a Taser-style high-voltage stun gun and forced them to hand over valuables including designer watches and mobile phones.

He lived in London until a year ago when he skipped bail and travelled to Syria to join a group of Islamic extremists waging war on President Assad’s regime.

Now it has been revealed that he was one of three British men killed as their group attacked pro-government forces near the city of Aleppo on August 11.

The trio were part of a group of ten British jihadists who joined up with  20 other Britons to fight with the Al-Nusra Front, which is allied to Al Qaeda.

A senior EU official, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said that beyond the fighters from the 28-nation EU, there were also some 500 from Balkan nations, highlighting the contribution from small nations like Bosnia and Kosovo.

'Kosovo has 80 to 100 for two million people,' he said.

The official said the total number of EU fighters could be well above 1,000, bringing it roughly in line with the AP assessment.
