Nicola Tweedy, 54, died two days after she had her varicose veins operated on at the Norfolk and Norwich hospital 

The death of a woman days after she underwent surgery on her varicose veins could have been prevented, her husband has today claimed.

Nicola Tweedy, 54, had the operation at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital in March last year and was discharged the same evening.

But two days later the mother-of-two was found apparently asleep in her chair at the family home in Pulham Market, Norfolk.

When her family failed to rouse the classroom assistant, they called an ambulance.

Despite the best efforts of the paramedics called, Mrs Tweedy died.

A post-mortem examination later confirmed she had suffered a pulmonary embolism, a blood clot which reached her lungs.

An inquest heard staff at the hospital failed to ensure Mrs Tweedy was fully aware of the risk of suffering a blood clot during the operation, because of an 'oversight'.

Her husband, Chris Tweedy, 53, said he is now considering taking civil action against the hospital, claiming he believes his wife's death could have been prevented. 

The postman, who lives with the couple's two children, said: 'They were required to avoid harming her and, tragically, in my opinion, they did not.'

South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon said the case was a 'tragedy' which should prompt improvements.

He added: 'It is clear to me that more could and should have been done to mitigate the risks of what was deemed to be appropriate surgery for Mrs Tweedy, most crucially to place Mrs Tweedy and her family in a position to make a fully informed choice about whether to proceed with the operation.

'Any hospital treating over half a million people each year will occasionally not do everything perfectly. People are only human.

'But in the post-Mid Staffs world, when things have been less than perfect, patients and families now expect - and frankly are entitled to expect - much greater openness.'

Consultant vascular surgeon Robert Brightwell admitted to the inquest in Norwich that a thrombosis risk assessment had not been completed. 

That meant the 54-year-old was not fully informed about the dangers of the surgery, including the increased risk for those with a high body mass index.

Nurse Susan Brown said she accepted it was 'an oversight' and that a checklist had not been completed on the patient's discharge notes.

Coroner Jacqueline Lake gave a narrative conclusion that Mrs Tweedy died following a 'rare but recognised' risk of surgery, adding she will write a report so that future deaths may be prevented. 

She said she was satisfied that the operation itself had been conducted appropriately. 

But raised concerns that Mrs Tweedy had not been given the correct leaflets on her care.

Speaking after the inquest Mr Tweedy said his family's lives had been 'damaged beyond repair'.

He described his wife and his 'happy, smiling soul-mate'.

Mrs Tweedy's husband, Chris, 53, who lives with the couple's two children, said he believes his wife's death could have been prevented

A post mortem examination revealed Mrs Tweedy died of a pulmonary embolism, a blood clot in her lungs

He added: 'Nicky was a happy, smiling, laughing, easy going, fun loving person all of her life.

'She was someone who loved, cared for, guided, supported and helped so many people throughout her life. 

'In my opinion, the Norfolk and Norwich  would have done nothing to learn the lessons from my wife's death, and to materially revise their protocols and procedures, which they have subsequently done, without my formal complaint and, even after that, without the very considerable pressure I have placed upon them, both personally and through other organisations.

'In the United Kingdom thousands of patients die a preventable death every year from hospital acquired venous thromboembolism. 

'Many thousands more have to live with the life changing consequences. 

'That, in my opinion, is a national scandal.'

A hospital spokeswoman expressed sympathy to the Tweedy family.

She added: 'Mrs Tweedy died of a rare but recognised complication of surgery, estimated to occur in approximately 0.01 per cent of cases, in other words one in 10,000 patients.

'While it is possible to reduce the risks of surgery they can never be eliminated entirely.

'The trust commissioned an independent review in order to identify any ways in which we could improve our services.

'Once we have the coroner's recommendations we will review these to identify any further opportunities for improvement.'

Lawyer Sharon Allison, of Ashton KCJ which represented the family, said: 'My client and his family are understandably devastated beyond words at their loss.

'They have many questions relating to the hospital's protocols concerning blood clotting risks.'

An inquest heard how a pre-surgery risk assessment was not completed, meaning Mrs Tweedy was not fully aware of the risks of suffering a blood clot during her operation
