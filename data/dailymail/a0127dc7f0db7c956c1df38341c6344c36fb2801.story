A controversial 1970s experiment took a newborn chimpanzee from his mother and moved him to New York City in an attempt to learn if apes could communicate with language.

It was hoped that if Nim Chimpsky was raised solely among humans, he would be able to master sign language.

But after a tumultuous journey, Nim struggled when he was returned back into the company of fellow chimpanzees and died prematurely at 26. In captivity, these apes can live up to 60.

Experimental: In the early 70s, a primate named Nim Chimpsky was the subject of an experiment whose purpose was to learn whether language is innate

Language classes: It was hoped that if Nim grew up around humans he would be able to communicate with sign language

Domestic: Nim took part in every aspect of family life

One of Nim's favorite playmates, Bob Ingersoll, told ABC News that he thought stress was a major factor in the animal's early death but that something else might have been to blame.

'It might actually be fair to say he died of a broken heart,' Ingersoll said.

The story of Nim Chimpsky will told on December 20 when a documentary on his life called Project Nim is broadcast on HBO.

Nim was taken from his mother at the Institute for Primate Studies in Oklahoma in 1973, under the control of Herb Terrace, a Columbia psychology professor.

Learning: Nim made good progress with sign language

Stephanie LaFarge breastfed the chimp for a few months

Growing up: Nim grew into a strong and occasionally aggressive adult chimp

Celebrity: Nim made the cover of New York Magazine

The chimp was brought to the large family home of Stephanie LaFarge in New York City, who brings him up in exactly the same manner as each of her seven children.

But Nim was a chimp, not a human, and as he grew up he created domestic chaos in the LaFarge household.

Nim was breastfed by LaFarge and bonded with her, but became jealous of her husband.

The chimp enjoys the spirit of the 1970s however and enjoys driving fast, drinking beer and occasionally smoking marijuana.

Nim turned into a media star, appearing on the front covers of New York and High Times magazine.

But a lack of routine caused Terrace to move Nim on and psychology student Laura Petitto looked after the chimp, teaching him sign language in classrooms at Columbia University.

Yet while Nim learned hundreds of signs, he was also growing physically.

Though playful and affectionate Nim also became increasingly violent and he attacked several trainers.

Petitto suffered a bite that required 37 stitches.

Terrace decided to end the experiment and returned Nim back to the Institute for Primate Studies.

But the animal was confused and distressed by meeting other members of his species for the first time since birth.

Things gradually improved for Nim under the supervision of Ingersoll, one of his best friends.

But
 when that institute ran out of money, he was moved to an NYU facility, 
where he lived in a small cage and was subjected to experiments.

When Nim returned to the institute where he was born he was disorientated by the company of other chimps

Nim's
 media status inspired a movement to free him. After a lawyer suggested 
that Nim be given a day in court to testify for himself using sign 
language, NYU sold the chimp to Black Beauty Ranch, a Texas animal 
sanctuary.

Yet with no chimp or human friends, Nim was again isolated and lonely.

In a fit of rage he accidentally killed a poodle.

When
 he was reunited with LaFarge, his first human 'mother', after nearly 20
 years he violently attacked her but spared her life.

Nim gradually calmed down with visits from several familiar faces, before dying in May 2000.
