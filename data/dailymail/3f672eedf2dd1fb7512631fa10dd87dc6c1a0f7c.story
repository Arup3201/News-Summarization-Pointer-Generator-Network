Fall: The number of slugs, spiders, worms and other invertebrates across the world has fallen by 45 per cent over the past 35 years, a study has revealed

The world’s population of creepy crawlies has fallen by nearly half – but that is bad news for us, experts warn.

A study published in the journal Science, reveals that the number of slugs, spiders, worms and other invertebrates has fallen by 45 per cent over the past 35 years as the human population has doubled.

Experts fear this will harm the planet as creepy crawlies play an important role in pollinating crops, pest control, decomposition and ensuring soil remains packed with nutrients, as well as water filtration.

The fall in invertebrate numbers is thought to be linked to the loss of their habitats and climate change.

In the UK the number of beetles, butterflies, bees and wasps has fallen by up to 60 per cent.

Experts warn that fewer insects would have a huge effect on crop production as up to 75 per are pollinated by insects, amounting to around 10 per cent of the world's food supply.

And the cost of pest control without natural predators could be more than £2.6 billion pounds in the United States alone.

Scientists fear a drop in the insect population could also spark a decline in birds, which prey on pests that damage crops, and amphibians, which help keep water supplies free from algae.

Decreasing invertebrate numbers are also known to compromise food production due to reduced pollination, seed dispersal and insect predation.

But the impact the continuing loss of animals, including invertebrates, has on the spread of human disease needs to be better understood as a priority, experts claim.

Dr Ben Collen, from University College London's Biosciences Department, said: 'We were shocked to find similar losses in invertebrates as with larger animals, as we previously thought invertebrates to be more resilient.

'While we don't fully understand what the long-term impact of these declining numbers will be, we are currently in the potentially dangerous position of losing integral parts of ecosystems without knowing what roles they play within it.

'Prevention of further declines will require us to better understand what species are winning and losing in the fight for survival and from studying the winners, apply what we learn to improve conservation projects.

'We also need to develop predictive tools for modelling the impact of changes to the ecosystem so we can prioritise conservation efforts, working with governments globally to create supportive policy to reverse the worrying trends we are seeing.'

Lead author Prof Rodolfo Dirzo, of Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment in the US, added: 'Where human density is high, you get high rates of defaunation, high incidence of rodents, and thus high levels of pathogens, which increases the risks of disease transmission.

'Who would have thought that just defaunation would have all these dramatic consequences, but it can be a vicious circle.

'We tend to think about extinction as loss of a species from the face of Earth, and that's very important, but there's a loss of critical ecosystem functioning in which animals play a central role that we need to pay attention to as well.

'Ironically, we have long considered that defaunation is a cryptic phenomenon, but I think we will end up with a situation that is non-cryptic because of the increasingly obvious consequences to the planet and to human well-being.'
