A brand new digitally animated Tetley advert featuring the Tetley Tea Folk premieres tomorrow night during Splash!.

Gaffer, Tina and Sydney - and a whole cast of aliens - star in the London-based clip which will have its first screening during the ITV show from 9pm.

The Tetley Tea folk are back on the boil boasting new digital makeovers 40 years after first appearing on British television to cheer the nation up this January.

You can watch the ad first exclusively here on MailOnline...

Relaxed as ever, gentle northerners Gaffer and Tina put the kettle on while chaos unfolds

The loveable trio try their hands at diplomacy as they aid talks between the Prime Minister and a host of alien invaders (dubbed Krogs) in their TV comeback after a four-year tea break.

Gaffer the governor, assistant Sydney and tea taster Tina help diffuse tension with a quality cuppa as alien ships hover above famous London landmarks such as the River Thames, London Eye and Big Ben.

Since their inception in 1973, the Tetley Tea Folk have starred in over 60 campaigns and the latest instalment in the genre has been created using pioneering Legacy and Softimage XSi technology – the same technology used in Hollywood blockbuster, The Hobbit.

The return is part of a £1.8m campaign designed to show the difference a good brew can make to folk with busy lifestyles.

The premiere coincides with the new 
'Brew Monday' research from Tetley on what is typically known as Blue Monday - the most depressing day of the year.

We may be faced with bills, rain, debts diets and abstinence, but Tetley hopes to fight back 
against the January Blues by revealing a nice, simple cup of tea is still the nation's favourite drink. They found 80
 per cent of Britons agree a brew and a biscuit is the best is to lift your 
spirits.

TV 
psychologist Judi James investigated the nation's love of tea and found 
more than twice as many Britons would cheer up a friend in need with a 
cuppa first
 over a glass of wine.

Furthermore, it seems the days of the 
masculine stiff upper lip are gone, as almost half of British men now 
encourage their partners to offload problems and emotions onto them.

'Waking up on Blue 
Monday is never going to sound life-enhancing,' says Judi James.

'Brew Monday has a 
completely different ring to it though. Associating Mondays with a cup 
of tea suggests comfort, cosiness, happiness and sociability, all the 
things that can help ward off a bout of the blues,' she says.

Tetley introduced the Tea Folk brass brand in 1980, and with it launched the revolutionary round bag in 1990

With
 more than 34 billion cups of tea consumed in the UK every year - that's more than 165 million cups every day - the nation's love affair with a brew 
remains strong.

Since their inception in 1973, the 
much-loved Tetley mascots have become a national institution, 
and the brand remains one of the most popular teas in the UK.

They introduced the Tetley Tea Folk 
brass brand in 1980, and with it launched the revolutionary round bag in
 1990 with an Elvis-style tune ('Don't be a tea bag 
square').

Despite their nine year beak between 2001-2010, the Tea Folk's journey marks the development of tea-drinking habits 
across the country. 

1. Over 34 billion cups of tea are consumed in the UK every year

2. Tetley tea is consumed in 10 million kitchens across Britain and 36 million cups of Tetley are drunk each day

10. 175 years of Tetley Black/Original being a nation's favourite great tasting cuppa

Gaffer, his trusted assistant Sydney 
and friendly tea taster Tina, have featured in 67 different ads in the last four decades, where a tense situation is usually eased by a cup of Tetley's.

And the gang are taken out of their comfort zones once more in the new commercial which takes place in an eerie, apocalyptic London.

The latest installment of their adventures hits the small screen on January 25 and features new digital 
animation and a variety of visual effects.

It captures a number of 
London landmarks including the River Thames, London Eye and Big Ben, as
 aliens take over and the government seeks shelter in a secret underground 
bunker.

Tension ensues 
when the aliens confront the Prime Minister and this moment is diffused 
by the arrival of a certain squeaky tea trolley.

Just on time, The Tetley Tea 
Folk, led by bespectacled boss Gaffer, return to help ease the 
situation and make time for a little conversation over a quality cuppa tea.

'The message is 
simple,' says a Tetley representative. 'In the midst of busy, often pressure-filled lifestyles, it's 
time for us all to stop and share a little quality time over a mug of 
the UK's favourite hot drink.'
