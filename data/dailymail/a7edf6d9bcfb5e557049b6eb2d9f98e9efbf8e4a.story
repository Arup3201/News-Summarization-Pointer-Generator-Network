Virgin Media has been forced to apologise to thousands of customers after their inboxes were bombarded with hundreds of unwanted emails in error.

The problem occurred when one of the company's suppliers mistakenly sent out an email, which when it was replied to was then sent to all the other people in the group.

It meant that anyone clicking 'reply all' was able to message everyone on the mailing list - meaning their personal email addresses were visible.

Virgin Media insisted only a 'small proportion' of its customers were erroneously sent the mail.

Usain Bolt in the latest Virgin Media advertisment. The problem occurred when one of the company's suppliers mistakenly sent out an email, which when it was replied to was then sent to all the other people in the group

But according to the list of people in the group, more than 130,000 were affected. It appears that only those with a Virgin.net email address have had the problem.

Customers have reacted angrily to the data breach, complaining it meant that their email address was visible for thousands to see.

Liz French said: 'As a leading 
technology provider, I find it indefensible that Virgin can allow an 
error on this scale to occur.

'Not
 only did it inconvenience many thousands of people and compromise their
 online security, it may well have cost small businesses both money and 
customers.

'At no point did Virgin get in contact with those affected or issue an apology. I hope the Data Commissioner looks into this very seriously.'

A Virgin Media spokeswoman confirmed the email address had been disabled.

Virgina Media has since confirmed the email address had been disabled

She said: 'A small proportion of our customers have received an email from one of our suppliers which, if they reply-all, it is sent to a wider group.

'We're investigating exactly what has happened and, in the meantime, advise people not to respond to this email. We apologise for the inconvenience caused.'
