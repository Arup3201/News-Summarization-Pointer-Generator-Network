Liverpool are 'very relaxed' amid suggestions they may have almost £7million of Champions League prize money withheld due to breaches of UEFA Financial Fair Play regulations.

Liverpool are due to receive the money next month, after qualifying for the first time in five years - but in order to meet Financial Fair Play regulations clubs must not lose more than £35.4m over a period of two seasons.

Manchester City and Paris St Germain both exceeded that figure and suffered significant penalties.

Liverpool must not have lost more than £35.4m over a period of two seasons but trust in youth development

Liverpool's losses for the 2012-13 financial year were £49.8m, plus £41m losses for the 10-month period through to May 2012.

However, clubs can use investment in youth development and club infrastructure to offset those figures and Liverpool believe they would have a strong case to present to UEFA should they be investigated.

Clubs can also use projected revenues when arguing their case and Liverpool figures for the current year are expected to be very healthy.
