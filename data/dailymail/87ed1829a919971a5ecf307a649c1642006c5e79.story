Russia’s Federal Security Service has publicly named the man who it says is the CIA station chief in Moscow.

The unusual decision to release the identity of the agent who arrested US diplomat Ryan Fogle after he tried to recruit him, is said to be a breach of intelligence protocol.

According to the Telegraph, there could be an angry response from the US Government as the names of intelligence officers are not released to the public.

A diplomat with the same name is 
listed as a Counsellor in the US Moscow embassy. It was unclear if he 
was still based in the country, said the Telegraph.

Undercover diplomat Ryan Fogle has 
been mercilessly mocked on the web both in Russia and the West for his 
apparently amateurish Boy's Own approach to espionage in Moscow.

Arrested: The US diplomat was pinned to the ground and arrested by the Russian agent he was trying to recruit

Claims: The FSB counter intelligence service said the envoy, a third secretary in the political section of the American embassy was caught red handed seeking to recruit a Russian intelligence officer

Detained: The FSB said Fogle was in possession of two floppy wigs, three pairs of glasses, a map of Moscow and a folding knife when he was detained

Seized: After his arrest, he was taken to the FSB headquarters at the Lubyanka, in Moscow, and later handed over to the US embassy in keeping with diplomatic protocols

But the FSB claimed that the Russian anti-terrorism expert he was
hoping to lure to treachery wasted no time in personally apprehending 
him, pinning him to the ground, and handing him over to the authorities.

'The man behaved like an officer 
worthy of his name, detaining the recruiter and handing him over to 
counterintelligence authorities' said an FSB source yesterday.

'He will continue to serve. There is no threat to his career.'

The Russians have not named the 
target of the CIA approach but he is believed to be a specialist in 
terrorism linked to extremist Islamic groupings.

Fogle called him seeking a meeting at which he intended to recruit him, it is claimed.

Instead he ended up face on the 
ground, and handcuffed, before being taken to the notorious Lubyanka HQ 
of the secret services for questioning.

FBI agents first came across the 
Russian agent when they were given assistance by Moscow over the Boston 
marathon bombings, it is understood.

Fogle, 29, a third secretary in the 
embassy's political department, was detained wearing a blond wig under 
his baseball cap while on a mission to recruit the FSB operative on the 
night of May 13.

In his possession, Fogle had another 
wig, a compass, a map of Moscow, sunglasses, and a 'Dear Friend' letter -
apparently translated into Russian on Google - which offered $1 million
a year plus bonuses to the FSB man.

Fogle has been ordered to leave Russia in the next few days.

Statement: 'Recently, the US intelligence service has made repeated attempts to recruit the staff of Russian law enforcement agencies and special services,' according to the FSB

Stash: He was detained with 'special technical devices, written instructions for the person he was recruiting, a lot of cash, and things to help change one's appearance,' according to the FSB

Mission: The website of the American embassy in Russia informs that its Political Section is engaged in 'bringing to the attention of the Russian government the US position on the issues of foreign policy and security'

Questions: A letter the agent carried suggested the US government was willing to pay up to $1 million a year plus bonuses to his unidentified potential Russian recruit, if the letter released by the FSB is genuine

Release: Fogle was held overnight before being released to U.S. officials and expelled from Russia

The arrest of Ryan Fogle is just the latest twist in the long history of spying between the U.S. and Russia.

Famously, 10 Russian sleeper agents were arrested in June 2010 and accused of pretending to be ordinary Americans while secretly plotting against the country.

The best-known is Anna Chapman, above, who has become a major celebrity in her home country since being deported from the U.S.

In the Cold War period, however, U.S.-Soviet espionage was often a matter of life and death - in 1985, military officer Arthur D. Nicholson was shot dead by a Soviet sentry while spying in East Germany.

One of the war's major crises was caused by the shooting down of an American spy plane in 1960 and the subsequent capture of its pilot.

The FSB stressed yesterday that the 
US and Russia 'will try to avoid ratcheting up tension around the Ryan 
Fogle case, focusing instead on the positive aspects of their 
relations'.

But Russian intelligence services say they have trapped a CIA ‘spy’ as he offered millions of pounds to a senior Russian agent.

Diplomat
Ryan Fogle was thrown down and handcuffed in a night-time sting by the 
FSB secret service – formerly the KGB.

He had a rudimentary espionage kit 
containing a compass, map of Moscow, knives, a microphone, two wigs, 
three pairs of glasses, plastic bags containing thousands of euros and 
an RFID Shield, which prevents passports with computer chips being read 
remotely, Russian intelligence sources said.

The ‘agent’, a third secretary in the 
political section of the US embassy, was quizzed in the FSB’s feared 
Lubyanka complex before being handed over to US officials.

Unusually, the FSB made its coup 
public at once. It released pictures of a man being arrested in a blue 
checked shirt, dirty-blond wig and  baseball cap, along with images of 
him in detention.

Spy sources said Fogle was 
caught after a lengthy covert operation.

US ambassador Michael McFaul – 
who refused to comment on the news – has been summoned to Russia’s 
foreign ministry.

Fogle was caught in Vorontsovski Park, an area in south-east Moscow, the FSB said.

They implied that he wanted to contact a senior FSB agent who was snooping on Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the alleged Boston bomber.

A letter in Russian which Fogle 
carried suggests – if genuine – that the CIA hoped to reel in a big 
fish.

Addressed ‘Dear friend’, it states: ‘We are ready to offer you 
$100,000 [£65,000] and discuss your experience, expertise and 
co-operation, and the payment may go much higher if you are ready to 
answer certain questions.

‘For long-term co-operation we offer $1million [£650,000] per year.’

The recruit is instructed to use an 
internet cafe to ‘create a new Gmail mailbox which you will use only for
staying in touch with us’.

The incident is the biggest spy 
scandal since the arrest of glamorous agent Anna Chapman and nine other 
Russians in the US in 2010.

The FSB stated: ‘Recently, the US 
intelligence community has made repeated attempts to recruit employees 
of Russia’s law-enforcement bodies and special agencies.’
