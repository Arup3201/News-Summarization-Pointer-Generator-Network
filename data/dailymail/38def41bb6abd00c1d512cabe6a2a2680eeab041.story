Another life sentence: Nicky Suddons, 26, has been given a second life sentence after carrying out a savage sex attack while on day release from prison

A notorious rapist who carried out a savage sex attack at knifepoint after being let out of prison for a day on 'work experience' has been given a second life sentence.

Nicky Suddons, 26, was jailed for life aged 17 for a rape and six other serious assaults on women and a girl aged 13 in Manchester in 2004.

But after being deemed safe to work in the community, he assembled a ‘rape kit’ containing a knife, balaclava and rubber gloves.

Left unsupervised during his lunch 
break, he then tried to rape a woman in her 50s as she walked her Labrador in a park near Grantham, Lincolnshire.

The victim was only saved because the dog turned on the former lifeguard.

Now, Suddons has been handed a second life sentence with a minimum jail term of six years - but has been warned he may never be deemed safe to be released into the community.

Sentencing him at Lincoln Crown Court, Judge Sean Morris said: 'I stress that is the minimum term you will serve.

'I 
strongly suspect that the lesson in your case has been learned, and it 
will be many years, if not decades - and it may be never - when it comes to
 considering your release.

'You
 are an extremely dangerous human being. I am convinced you will 
sexually assault and rape women in the future if you are released.

'In
 this case your victim has been severely traumatised. She has not been 
able to return to work. She has been diagnosed with post traumatic 
stress disorder.

'She cannot now go out of her house without the dog and 
without a rape alarm. That is severe psychological harm.'

After his initial crime spree in 2004, Suddons became known as the ‘Yellow Brick Road’ rapist based on the area of Manchester where he carried out the attacks.

He later boasted about his crimes on social media sites, saying he carried out the knifepoint assaults for kicks and regarded himself as 'untouchable'.

He was handed a life sentence in September 2005 - with the judge warning he had ‘an extremely high risk of reoffending’ and 
was a ‘highly dangerous young man’.

But in Spring last year, Suddons was deemed safe to 
be let out of North Sea Camp open prison near Boston, Lincolnshire, to carry 
out painting and decorating work in Grantham.

By that time, he has completed a sex offender treatment programme designed to deter him from committing further sex attacks.

Under the day release arrangement, 
Suddons slept at the prison every night, but was allowed out during the 
day to carry out his work placement.

While out of prison, he collected together the 'rape kit' - including condoms to stop police tracing him through DNA - before attempting to rape the middle-aged woman during his lunch hour.

David Outterside, prosecuting, said Suddons had left his work renovating an old property for a church, before making his way to Queen Elizabeth Park where he lay in wait for a victim.

After changing his clothes, he then confronted the woman as she walked her pet Labrador through a wooded area.

The woman told the jury how she turned round to find herself face to face with a masked man brandishing a knife. She said she fell to the ground and screamed while her dog started barking.

Suddons stood over her and warned 'Don’t scream', the court heard.

The woman told the jury: 'My eyes were 
fixed on the knife and the mask. His thumb was on the Stanley knife as 
if the blade was ready to be flicked.'

Suddons backed off as the dog lunged at him and then fled, but was caught and later arrested after a cyclist stopped him from leaving the park.

Mr Outterside said that Suddons had carefully planned the attack and had hoped his rape kit would help him avoid the mistakes he had made leading to his arrest in 2004.

'What was on his mind was rape,' he said. 'This time he was prepared and was absolutely determined not to be caught. He thought he could get clean away with it but he was caught red-handed.'

Concern: Suddons's conviction in December sparked a review of the prisoner day release scheme by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling

Suddons, originally from Abbey Hey, Manchester, received his first life 
sentence at Manchester Crown Court in September 2005 after admitting a
 rape and six sexual assaults on victims aged between 13 and 28.

Several of the attacks were at knife point taking place in a local park and in an area close to a canal.

He
 was ordered to serve a minimum of just four years because he was a 
juvenile aged 17 when he committed the offences.

In his latest case, he denied attempting to rape the middle-aged woman on 28 June 2013, but the jury took less than an hour to convict him.

In evidence, he claimed the last time he had had sex was when he raped a 28-year-old woman in East Manchester ten years ago.

He told the jury: 'That was the last time I had sex. I think about sex the same as every bloke. I don’t think about it all the time. Not daily.'

Suddons's conviction in December sparked a review of the prisoner day release scheme by Justice
 Secretary Chris Grayling, who described the case as 'horrifying'.

'This is a truly horrifying case and one that needs to be investigated thoroughly,' he said.

‘I’m
 determined to get to the bottom of what went wrong and to take forward 
any lessons learnt from the reviews I have commissioned.

‘In
 future when people are released on temporary licence I want to see them
 tagged so we can better monitor where they are and where they have 
been.’

Last month, it was announced that day release from prison is to be scaled back following a series of serious crimes committed by offenders temporarily out of jail. 

Tighter rules about who is eligible for the scheme are to be introduced, while prisoners will only be allowed out for a specific purpose, such as gaining work experience, the Ministry of Justice said.

Day-release prisoners will also have to wear electronic tags, once technology is made available, the department added.

For prisoners with a history of serious crimes, there will be a new 'restricted' level where they will undergo stringent risk assessments by probation officers and other professionals. 

Suddons's case was the second high profile case involving an life sentence inmate from North Sea Camp on work placement.

In October 2012, Lee Cyrus went on the run after being let out on day release for work.

He was only arrested after going on a crime spree and was subsequently convicted following a jury trial of five counts of exposure, wounding with intent, unlawful wounding, affray, aggravated burglary, robbery and burglary.

He was jailed at Southwark Crown Court in December when he received a new life sentence and was ordered to serve a minimum of 11 years.
