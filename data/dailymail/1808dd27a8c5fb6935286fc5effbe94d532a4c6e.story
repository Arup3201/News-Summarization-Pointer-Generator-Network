A boatload of 32 starving Burmese refugees has been rescued off the coast of Sri Lanka - three weeks into a perilous voyage to Australia that had already claimed the lives 98 of their shipmates.

Emaciated and starving, the 31 men and one boy were picked up by the Sri Lankan navy just as their rickety wooden vessel finally began to sink, 900 miles into their 4,000-mile planned trip.

Incredibly, they claimed the boat had originally set sail with 130 passengers, but one by one their comrades died as dehydration, hunger and sunstroke began to take hold.

Miracle survival: The group of 31 men and one boy said the boat had originally set off with 130 passengers, but 98 had died one by one as dehydration, hunger and sunstroke began to take their hold

Dangerous mission: The men said they had tried to enter Malaysia but, when they were refused, they set sail again on the 4,000-mile trip south to Australia

And with bodies piling up on the boat 
and beginning to decompose under the hot equatorial sun, survivors said 
they were forced to dump the corpses into the sea as they drifted across
the Bay of Bengal.

The survivors were dragged to safety by the Sri Lankan navy 250 nautical miles off the island's eastern coast on Saturday.

Survivors have told local newspapers that there were 130 passengers at the beginning of the journey and 98 died on the way and their bodies were dumped to sea. 

They said they had tried to enter Malaysia but, when they were refused, they set sail again in the hope of finding asylum in Australia.

A naval spokesman said that its rescue ship 'Sagara' had monitored a distress signal from the boat on which the Myanmarese had been travelling last night.

The dramatic rescue came a month after some 138 Bangladesh and Myanmar nationals were found off the coast of Akkaraipattu to the east of Sri Lanka.
