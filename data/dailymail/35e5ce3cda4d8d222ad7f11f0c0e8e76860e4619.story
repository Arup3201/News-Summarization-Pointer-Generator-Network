Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, an opponent of same-sex marriage, has been accused of trying to sabotage laws allowing gay soldiers to wed in military chapels.

Mr Hammond is deadlocked with Culture Secretary Maria Miller, who introduced the laws that mean, from this spring, gay men and women will have the right to marry, including as soldiers in military chapels.

The reform was approved last year and called ‘shocking and damaging’ by Mr Hammond.

Deadlock: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond is at loggerheads with Culture Secretary Maria Miller after being accused of trying to sabotage laws allowing gay soldiers to wed in military chapels

Last week, talks between Mr Hammond’s and Mrs Miller’s officials failed to agree the regulations concerning military chapels – due to be tabled in the Commons this month.

Reliable sources say Mr Hammond maintains that  gay couples must demonstrate – subject to his personal approval – that this would not discriminate against others who use the multi-faith chapels and oppose such marriages.

‘Philip is stonewalling because he doesn’t like gay weddings,’ said one official.

One of his allies said the demand was only to respect the wishes of other groups and in line with the legislation.

Mrs Miller has already brought forward the start of same-sex marriage to March 29. The row could delay the scheduled June start for gay weddings in military chapels.
