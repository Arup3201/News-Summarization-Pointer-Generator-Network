Schoolchildren have been attacked by fellow pupils who organised ‘Kick a Ginger Kid Day’, inspired by the cartoon South Park.

Youngsters with ginger hair were targeted on their way to classes and inside the building as other students kicked them.

Senior staff at the 850-student Wingfield Academy in Rotherham say some students who have carried out the attacks have been ‘strongly reprimanded’.

Parents set up a Facebook group which has attracted more than 40 members to discuss what had happened to their targeted children

The idea is believed to have been taken from an episode of the controversial cartoon South Park and websites have been set up aimed at organising a ‘National Kick a Ginger Kid Day’.

Parents have launched their own Facebook group to highlight the issue and have complained to Academy head Russell Heritage to make sure there is not repeat of the violence.

One mother, who asked not to be named, said she had taken her 13-year-old son out of school until she is given assurances there will be no further incidents.

She said: 'My son rang me and said kids were kicking him saying it was National Kick a Ginger Kid Day. He was scared so I went to get him out of school.

'My son’s leg is swollen and there are bruises coming through. They said it was going to to be Kick a Blonde Kid Day the day after.

Parents are outraged at the vicious attacks, and the school have assured them that some pupils have been 'reprimanded'

Parents warned other children not to take part in 'kick a ginger kid' day, which is believed to stem from a South Park cartoon

'It is both boys and girls who have been carrying out this bullying and I want action from the school to make sure it doesn’t happen again.

'Apparently it has originated from an episode of the American show South Park and websites have sprung up about it.'

The unofficial day is believed to have been inspired by an episode of the controversial cartoon South Park.

In 'Ginger Kids' Cartmen, the programme's most bigoted character makes a presentation targeting people with red hair, pale skin, and freckles.

This leads to the majority of the town discriminating against people with ginger hair, highlighting how easy it is to persuade people to hate another section of society with no justifying argument.

Cartman's friends dye his hair ginger while he is asleep and after suffering hateful treatment from the rest of his town, he decides to rally the red-heads and fight those who are not ginger.

Eventually, Cartman realises the error of his ways and the town decides to overlook their differences and live in peace.

The Kick a Ginger Day website stresses that the whole event is a joke and no one should kick another person.

They sell merchandise praising people with red hair and emphasises that the day should not be put into reality.He said: 'I think it’s disgusting. It’s 
very upsetting for my daughter. If I went into school and kicked a kid 
then I would be arrested.

The father of another 13-year-old Year 9 
pupil said his auburn-haired daughter had been singled out for the 
bullying and went home with bruised legs.

'The two kids who kicked my daughter were
given lunchtime detention and made to apologise, but how do we know 
they will not go for her again outside school.

'She should be able to go to school 
without having to worry about being kicked in the corridor. When I spoke
to the police they said they would treat it as an assault, but it is up
to the school to involve them.'

Police are understood to be investigating
the incidents at the Academy for 11-16-year-olds where at least six 
youngsters were attacked.

Several websites have chosen November 20th as an ‘official’ National Kick a Ginger Kid Day so parents now fear there could be further problems.

Parents set up their own Facebook group, which has attracted around 40 members, so to highlight the problem, share pictures of their injured children and warn other children not to kick others.

Wingfield Academy has its own 14-page Anti-Bullying Police document which says it is ‘unacceptable’ and ‘all students and pupils should know that incidents will be dealt with promptly and effectively.’

The school has posters and notice boards and in classrooms to tell students what to do if they are being bullied and a ‘post box’ is set up in the on-site learning resources centre for students to report incidents anonymously or name culprits.

A spokesman said the Academy stood strongly by their zero tolerance policy regarding discrimination and violence.

He said: 'These deplorable acts, done in 
the name of singling innocent people out, have no place in our school 
and as soon as it was brought to our attention that such acts had taken 
place in our school, we acted swiftly to deliver a strong message.

'The pupils involved in carrying out 
these acts of violence have been strongly reprimanded and a school-wide 
warning has gone out that any future acts of violence, carried out in 
the name of discrimination, or any other reason, will be met with 
similar strong and decisive action.

'Wingfield Academy has a long and proud history of supporting our students and ensuring that they have a safe environment to learn in, where they can feel secure to come every day and know that they have the staff’s support, which makes what happened recently even more sickening.'

Originally Wingfield Comprehensive School it became a specialist school and renamed Wingfield Business & Enterprise College before becoming Wingfield Academy in August this year.

On its website the Academy boasts: 'The level of care, support and guidance for students was described by Ofsted as ‘Outstanding’.

'The very positive ethos of the academy has its foundations in developing mutual respect, entrepreneurship, integrity and personal independence.'
