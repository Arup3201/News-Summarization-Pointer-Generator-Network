Writing love letters to your significant other could get a new lease of life thanks to a new 'doodle duvet' that allows you to scribble notes to your partner straight onto your bed sheets.

But lazy spouses might be in for an unpleasant surprise when they awake as the company behind the duvet says it also comes in handy as a place to leave a to-do list for dozing partners.

Luckily, they won't have to worry about spending hours boil-washing it - the doodle duvet comes with a special set of wash-out pens.

Ingenious: The new doodle duvet lets you leave notes to your partner, or in this case, visiting grandparents

Fun: Because the water-based ink washes straight off, the duvets are a great way to entertain children

Every time you put the duvet coverss, which cost £55 for a double and £39.95 for a single, in the wash your 
artwork will disappear - provided you use their special pens on the 100 
per cent cotton sheets.

According to makers Doodle by Stitch, which is based in Salisbury, Wiltshire, the linen can also be used as unusual way of letting children get creative without incurring the wrath of their parents.

Doodle By Stitch is run by ex-Vogue and Marie Claire Beauty Editor Chrissie Probert Jones and Southampton University graduate Emilie Prior.

Mrs Probert Jones, a 58 year old mother of three, said: 'I thought it would be so much fun writing notes on a duvet and not on a piece of paper.

Romantic: The duvets could become an invaluable help for shy men in search of the perfect proposal

Useful: The company has also launched a doodle tablecloth - perfect for parents of small children

'I started researching pens and working out how to get them made because you would want a blank piece of paper every time.

'I found some and they looked fab so I went ahead with it all. The single duvets are great for kids. At exhibitions the boys and girls go crazy for it.'

The duo have also released a doodle tablecloth, from £35, which they say is an inexpensive way of keeping children amused at mealtimes.

She added: 'I think the tablecloths will be a real classic for us - they’re great for parties and for corporate brainstorming.'
