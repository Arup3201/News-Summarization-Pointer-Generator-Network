Hundreds of the highest earners at HSBC could be in line for a bumper pay rise as the lender tries to swerve a new bonus cap from Brussels.

The chairman of HSBC admitted yesterday that it was considering plans to hike salaries for employees to ensure they do not leave for better paid jobs with  US or Asian rivals.

Douglas Flint, who received a £2.4 million package last year, said the lender would ‘comply with the law’ but needs to ‘remain competitive’.

The comments sparked a furious reaction from campaigners and came as HSBC announced a 10pc rise in profits to £9.2b billion in the first half of the year.

Deborah Hargreaves, chair of the High Pay Commission, called on shareholders to ‘step in to address this blatant flouting of the spirit of the law’ and warned that other banks would ‘follow suit.’

She said: ‘Big bonuses in banking are something that the public has failed to understand the need for. Stupid statements like this only serve to undermine the public confidence that banks are capable of changing.’

HSBC, Europe's biggest bank, paid 204 of its staff more than £1 million last year

HSBC, Europe’s biggest bank, paid 204 of its staff more than £1 million last year, including £4.4 million in pay and perks for chief executive Stuart Gulliver. But the release of share bonuses awarded to him in previous years took his total package to just under  £9 million.

Mr Gulliver could be one of those  affected by the cap as his annual bonus of £2 million was worth more than his £1.25 million salary.

Staff at the investment bank received an average bonus of more than £50,000. In January banks heaquartered in EU will face strict limits on the bonuses they can pay staff across the world.

They will not be allowed to pay a bonus worth more than a year’s salary, unless they receive the approval of shareholders. The absolute maximum will be twice annual salary.

The rules were introduced in the wake of the financial crisis. But they have been fiercely opposed by the Bank of England and the Government, which has tried in vain to block the plans.

Banks with large offices outside Europe but which have their headquarters in the EU have complained bitterly that staff working in Asia and the US will be poached by local rivals  which do not have such restrictions on pay.

Mr Flint admitted it was considering hiking basic pay to prevent this from happening.

‘We will comply with the law but we believe we will be able to make ourselves competitive’.

Asked whether the bank would raise salary, Mr Flint said: ‘It’s certainly one of the possibilities. We are looking at a whole range if things to see what we can do.  The important thing is we remain competitive.’

The comments confirm the worst fears of the Treasury and the Bank of England  which have warned that the introduction of a bonus cap would simply cause banks to raise the basic salaries of staff.

The Bank of England’s stability watchdog the Prudential Regulation Authority believes a hike in salaries could pose a risk to the safety of Britain’s banks.

This is because while they can cut bonuses to shore up their finances in times of crisis, it is very difficult to reduce basic pay.

British banks have continued to dish out lavish bonuses to staff, despite being embroiled in a string of scandals.

Last year HSBC was fined more than £1.2 billion for routinely laundering money for drugs gangs in Mexico and the US.

The lender revealed it had set aside another £237 million to compensate customers mis-sold payment protection insurance. This takes its total provision to £1.8 billion.
