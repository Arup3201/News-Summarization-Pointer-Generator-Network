This eerie photograph showing a UFO flashing across the sky was captured by a grandfather who has been left baffled by the 'mysterious object'.

Amateur photographer Michael Potter took the image while photographing the cloud formations above the seaside resort of Mount's Bay in Cornwall.

He was about to delete the picture when he noticed the unexplained flash of light streaking across the sky.

'I uploaded the photos to my laptop and had decided to delete the picture because of the apparent sunspot over part of the image,' he said.

'But just as I was about to press delete I noticed the image on the left of the photograph of what I thought was either an aircraft or the sun shining through the clouds.

'Something which had not been apparent when I took the photo. I enlarged the photo the best I could and was intrigued by what I saw.'

Mr Potter has since been puzzling over the identity of the UFO, which he initially thought was the result of a problem with his camera.

'I have showed the image to friends - and from dirt on the lens, sun shining through the clouds illuminating an aircraft, to it being a substantial meteorite we have explored every option,' he said.

'But I took 40-odd photos that day and only this one is blemished. The photo hasn't been Photoshopped or tampered with, so what is the mysterious object?'

The object, which appears to have a triangular shape, appeared in the so-called 'UFO Triangle', an area off the Cornwall coast where spooky sightings are common.

The region has more paranormal activity than anywhere else in Britain, according to the Cornwall UFO Research Group.

Cosmic? The object could be a meteor giving out a bright light as it burns up in the sky

However, sceptics may suggest that it is more likely to be a meteor burning up in the sky as it shoots towards Earth.

Meteors are typically tiny pieces of space debris which can date back as far as 4.3billion years.

They create a bright light as they burn up in the Earth's atmosphere, travelling at speeds of up to 45 miles per second.

The orange colour of the UFO suggests that it may have been a meteor composed primarily of sodium, which typically produces an orange or yellow hue.
