A kite flyer who died after being swept 50ft into the air by his power kite and plunged to the ground has been named as Marcus Garwood.

The 27-year-old died on Sunday after a freak gust of wind at Dunstable Downs, Bedfordshire caught the kite, which had a 20ft wingspan, and carried him away in front of his friends and family.

He plunged 50ft onto the hillside and sustained multiple fractures including a broken leg and pelvis, before dying at the scene of a suspected heart attack.

Tributes posted on Kite Crowd web forum 
told how Mr Garwood 'loved what he did so very much' and revealed his 
passion for power kiting, snowboarding and car racing.

Mr Garwood, from Dunstable, Bedfordshire, who attended Northfields Upper School and Dunstable College, is believed to have begun power kiting four years ago.

The HSS tool hire worker had posted videos online displaying his talent for performing aerial tricks at heights of 20ft in winds of up to 40mph.

A tribute on Kite Crowd forum by Newbiejumper, aged 32, who claims to be a friend of Marcus from Bedfordshire, said he witnessed the accident.

He said: 'He launched got lofted held it out had it was looking like it was under control was coming down nice and steady he got to about 20ft off the floor the kite just dropped caught the wind and supermaned him the winds were comin up the hill and on the website just before the accident it was reading 11mph as far as i remeberand (sic) and bex your right he loved what he did so very much.'

They continued: ‘It really was just a freak accident.

‘RIP Markos. Hope the winds are better where you are now.’

Dunstable Downs has a 200ft hill that is popular with kite fliers, as prevailing winds hit the ridge and are forced up at speed.

Once off the ground, there are often separate bands of wind that can be even faster and potentially more dangerous.

Mr Garwood, who died on Sunday afternoon, is understood to have been using an ellipse-shaped kite described as being ‘double-skinned, like a soft, inflatable wing’.

His death came a week after a two-day kite festival at the spot, which was run in association with the National Trust and featured professional displays.

Stephen Hoath, a member of the 
Flying Squad – which took part in the event and was in the area again on
Sunday – said of large power kites: ‘These things are becoming more 
powerful and they are becoming more and more affordable as the price 
comes down.

‘You are 
creating an element of risk when flying them but I  think this chap was 
just unlucky. From what I can gather there  was no inappropriate 
behaviour going on.’

Many 
kites now come with safety mechanisms that swiftly cut the powerful 
effect of the wind by slackening some of the cords – but enthusiasts, 
who often wear harnesses, can still be caught out by a sudden gust.

Peter
Shaw, vice-chairman of the British Kitesurfing  Association, said: 
‘It’s one of those calls where you have to decide whether to let go 
quickly or  hang on.

‘The 
most important safety  feature is the brain. You’ve got  to be able to 
make a decision  to use these things and whether it is safe.'

A
post-mortem examination was due to be carried out on the man today, 
and an inquest is expected to be opened and adjourned this week.

An ambulance service spokesman said he suffered ‘multiple traumatic injuries and went into suspected cardiac arrest’.

A police spokesman added:  ‘Details are sketchy because the coroner will be investigating and speaking to witnesses.

‘We know a young man aged 27 from Bedfordshire was flying his kite . . . we can only assume the wind took him.'
