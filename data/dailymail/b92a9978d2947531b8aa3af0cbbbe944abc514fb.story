Deal: Sgt. Robert Bales' lawyer said that he will be pleading guilty in an effort to avoid the death penalty, which the U.S. Army was seeking in his case after he reportedly killed 16 Afghan villagers in a predawn rampage in March

The U.S. Army said Wednesday it will seek the death penalty against the soldier accused of killing 16 Afghan villagers in a predawn rampage in March, a decision his lawyer called 'totally irresponsible.'

The announcement followed a pretrial hearing last month for Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, 39, who faces premeditated murder and other charges in the attack on two villages in southern Afghanistan.

The slayings drew such angry protests that the U.S. temporarily halted combat operations in Afghanistan, and it was three weeks before American investigators could reach the crime scenes.

Prosecutors said Bales left his remote southern Afghanistan base early on March 11, attacked one village and returned to the base, then slipped away again to attack another nearby compound. Of the 16 people killed, nine were children.

No date has been set for Bales' court martial, which will be held at Joint Base Lewis-McChord south of Seattle.

His civilian lawyer, John Henry Browne, said he met with Army officials last week to argue his client shouldn't face the possibility of the death penalty, given that Bales was serving his fourth deployment in a war zone when the killings occurred.

'The Army is not taking responsibility for Sgt. Bales and other soldiers that the Army knowingly sends into combat situations with diagnosed PTSD, concussive head injuries and other injuries,' Browne said.

'The Army is trying to take the focus off the failure of its decisions, and the failure of the war itself, and making Sgt. Bales out to be a rogue soldier.'

Bales' wife, Kari Bales, said in a statement Wednesday that she and their children have been enjoying their weekend visits with Bales at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, and she hopes he receives an impartial trial.

'I no longer know if a fair trial for Bob is possible, but it very much is my hope, and I will have faith,' she said.

Bales' defense team has said the government's case is incomplete, and outside experts have said a key issue going forward will be to determine if Bales suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. Bales grew up in the Cincinnati suburb of Norwood, Ohio, and served tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan.

During last month's preliminary hearing, prosecutors built a strong eyewitness case against the veteran soldier, with troops recounting how they saw Bales return to the base alone, covered in blood.

Afghan witnesses questioned via a video link from a forward operating base near Kandahar City described the horror of that night. A teenage boy recalled how the gunman kept firing as children scrambled, yelling: 'We are children! We are children!'

A young girl in a bright headscarf recalled hiding behind her father as he was shot to death.

An Army criminal investigations command special agent testified earlier that Bales tested positive for steroids three days after the killings, and other soldiers testified that Bales had been drinking the evening of the massacre.

Prosecutors, in asking for a court-martial trial, have pointed to statements Bales made after he was apprehended, saying his comments demonstrated a 'clear memory of what he had done, and consciousness of wrongdoing.'

Several soldiers testified at a hearing that Bales returned to the base alone just before dawn, covered in blood, and that he made incriminating statements such as, 'I thought I was doing the right thing.'

The U.S. military has not executed anyone since 1961. There are five men currently facing military death sentences, all for murders committed stateside, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.

Nidal Hasan, charged in the 2009 rampage that killed 13 and wounded more than two dozen others at Fort Hood in Texas, also could face the death penalty if convicted; no date has been set for his court martial.

For Bales to face execution, the court martial jury must unanimously find him guilty of premeditated murder. They also must determine that at least one aggravating factor applies, such as multiple or child victims, and that the aggravating factor substantially outweighs any extenuating or mitigating circumstances.

Innocent: Kari Bales told ABC News last month: 'My husband did not do this. I truly believe from the bottom of my heart that my husband is not involved'

Bales, a father
of two 
from Lake Tapps, Wash., joined the Army in late 2001 - after the 9/11 
attacks - as his career as a stockbroker imploded. An arbitrator entered
a $1.5 million fraud judgment against him and his former company that 
went unpaid, and his attempt to start an investment firm in Florida also
failed.

He was serving his fourth combat tour
after three stints in Iraq, and his arrest prompted a national 
discussion about the stresses posed by multiple deployments.

Kari Bales maintains
that her husband is innocent and was not responsible for the senseless 
slayings. Speaking to ABC News last month, she said she finds it 
'incomprehensible' that her husband and best friend, 'Bob,' faces 16 
charges of premeditated murder.

'It doesn't seem possible. Especially
that there were women and children,' she said. 'My heart goes out to 
those families that lost loved ones, parents and grandparents. I am a 
mom; I can't imagine losing my child, especially to something like 
that.'

Ms Bales said she learned of the 
attack within hours from military officials and her initial reaction was
that 'it must have been a mistake.'

'It
certainly wasn't, it wasn't my husband,' she said. 'I know my husband. I know 
him very well, and especially the talk about the women and the children.
I knew that it wasn't my husband. So it was just incomprehensible to 
me.'

Speaking to her husband in the middle of that March night confirmed to her that even he didn't know what really happened.

'He was like, 'What? What you talking
about?' He had, he knew that something was going on, but did not know 
the extent of what was going on, and I was actually the one that had 
told him how many people had died, and that included women and children,
and he was blown away. He did not know the details as they had been 
portrayed in the press.'

But Kari told ABC News she believes the 
truth has yet to come out. 'I don't think we have even begun to have the truth.'

In the meantime, Ms Bales said she 
finds it hard explaining to the couples' two-year-old son and 
five-year-old daughter why their father is sitting in a jail cell.

'It's
been difficult,' she said. 'I question myself, what is the right thing 
to say, what is the right thing to explain to them, what can they 
understand? And for me, I don't even really understand what is 
happening, so how can I possibly expect my kids to understand, right?'

But
the family regularly travels the to where Bales' has been calling home.
Their conversations are monitored but at least, she says, they can be a
family.

'We
are together, we're as a family. We're regular; we can look forward to 
it. We know when we are going to see him again. It's somewhat normal,' 
she said.

To
help pay what could end up being millions of dollars in legal fees, Ms 
Bales has set up a website, www.helpsgtbales.com, where people can 
donate to the SSG Bales Legal Defense Fund.

'Really
the reason we need a defense fund is to get a fair trial out of this. I
really feel Bob gave his best for his country. Now it is time for 
America to give their best to him.'

She
told the TV station that she tries not to dwell on the possibility that
her husband may spend his life behind bars or worse, face the death 
penalty.

'I
have come to terms with that, and that I have put away. You know, I 
thought about it and I put it away until I actually have to deal with 
it. So you, I have learned to compartmentalize a lot of these issues, 
too. Yes, I've thought about it and yes, that scares me.'
