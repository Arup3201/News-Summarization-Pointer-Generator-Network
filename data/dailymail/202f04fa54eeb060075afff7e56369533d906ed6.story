Human cannonball Matthew Cranch, 24, as killed when the safety net intended to break his fall after he was fired into the air collapsed

The death of a 'human cannonball' who died after being fired into the air at a stunt show has been ruled an accident, an inquest has ruled.

Matthew Cranch suffered multiple injuries after a safety net intended to break his fall collapsed as he fell to the ground on April 25, 2011.

The 24-year-old had been fired from a lorry-mounted cannon during Scott May's Daredevil Stunt Show at the Kent County Showground in Detling.

An inquest, sitting at Archbishop's Palace, Maidstone, heard that a mechanism which triggered the release of the safety net was not properly set.

Tests carried out following the tragedy showed the mechanism could be unintentionally falsely closed, leading to the net dropping when the lorry recoiled upon firing of the cannon.

In her closing remarks to jurors before they retired, Mid Kent and Medway coroner Patricia Harding said it was 'undoubtedly a tragic case' but she urged them to be dispassionate.

She said: 'This is not a trial. It's an inquest into a death, a fact-finding mission to find out how Mr Cranch died. There is no indictment, no criminal charge.'

In its conclusion, the jury said: 'At some point during the firing of the cannonball, the safety net quick release mechanism activated prematurely as a result of it being incorrectly set.

'As a result, Matthew Cranch sustained multiple injuries.'

Mr Cranch, who was living in Cornwall, had performed the showpiece five times before the tragedy and had joined the stunt team just one week before his death. 

Kent Police announced in December 2012 that no criminal prosecution would be brought over Mr Cranch's death.

In footage shown at the inquest, one of Mr Cranch's colleagues was heard giving a '3, 2, 1' countdown on the public address system before he shouted 'fire'.

Mr Cranch could then be seen being propelled from the cannon amid a cloud of pyrotechnic smoke as the safety net in front of him suddenly collapsed.

He later died at Maidstone Hospital. 

Mechanical engineer Alex Grimes, tested the safety net trigger mechanism and found that when the latch was fully closed, the net could not be released.

But on a third occasion he engineered the mechanism so that it was falsely closed. On this occasion, the safety net did release when the vehicle recoiled as the cannon fired.

Pictures taken of the mechanism several months after Mr Cranch's death showed a build-up of dirt and grease on it. 

Mr Grimes said that dirt or grit could have impacted on the mechanism's performance, but he could not confirm whether this contributed to the failing or not.

A second expert, Charles Simmons-Jacobs, a specialist inspector in mechanical engineering, said it appeared the trigger had not been set 'to the end of its travel'. 

Stunt show employees, including Tommy Austin, who set up the trigger mechanism on the safety net on the day, told the inquest they were not aware the mechanism could be set in a falsely closed position.

Tony Nicholls, the chief mechanic at Stunts UK Ltd, and the man who fired Mr Cranch from the cannon on the day of the tragedy, said he heard the click of the net release mechanism just after Mr Cranch was sent flying through the air.

Mr Nicholls, who has no formal mechanical qualifications but has years of experience, was asked how he would ensure that the lug engaged with the latch.

He told the inquest: 'For me, it was the noise, like a car door when you hear it has been engaged.'

Whenever he set the mechanism, Mr Nicholls said he would do so using force 'to make sure it was in every time'.

Mr Nicholls said the trigger release mechanism, which was partly in a sealed unit, was routinely pressure washed, lubricated using WD40 and checked for fatigue.

He said there were equipment checks before each performance and more in-depth maintenance during breaks between performances.

At the time of Mr Cranch's death, his friends described him as a 'thrill-seeker' who opted out of his promising academic career and his conventional middle-class upbringing

Motorcycle stuntman Scott May said said the showpiece stunt had been performed about 1,000 times

Mr Cranch had suffered serious injuries to his heart, head and chest and died in the ambulance after suffering a cardiac arrest two minutes before arriving at hospital, the inquest was told

Asked whether he had ever encountered problems with the net release trigger mechanism not setting properly, he replied: 'No, never.'

Scott May, he owner and managing director of family-run Stunts UK Ltd, said training to use the device involved employees watching senior colleagues doing it before performing it themselves under supervision, then on their own. 

Mr May said the showpiece stunt had been performed around 1,000 times with no issue.

He said: 'Any faults that are found results in equipment being taken out and rectified and put back in the show.'

Tony Nicholls, chief mechanic at Stunts UK Ltd, said safety was a 'top priority' and if anyone voiced concerns about safety, a stunt would not go ahead until it had been put right.

Mr Cranch's parents Michael Michael and Pauline and his sister Eleanor attended the hearing.
