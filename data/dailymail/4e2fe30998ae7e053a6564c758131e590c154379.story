'Narcissist': Serial killer Dennis Nilsen is serving life for murdering six people including Billy Sutherland

Google has shut down a vile blog which has been publishing the banned autobiography of serial killer Dennis Nilsen – after The Mail on Sunday revealed its existence earlier this month.

Yesterday, responding to an appeal by the family of Billy Sutherland – a part-time chef and divorced father-of-one who was Nilsen’s fourth victim – Google took the sexually explicit material off  its Blogger site.

Nilsen, 67, an ex-police officer and  civil servant, is serving a life sentence for murdering six young men and attempting to kill two others in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

He boiled the heads of his victims at two London flats and kept their bodies under his floorboards for months.

The twisted killer wrote a memoir from inside prison in which he attempts to explain his appalling crimes and even calls himself a 'victim'.

Chapters posted on the site 
included material about Nilsen’s early life and his dead grandfather - 
which is used to justify his later crimes.

In 1996 Nilsen wrote his life story, Nilsen: History Of A Drowning Man. A copy was taken out of jail by his then solicitor, but publication was vetoed and the manuscript was not returned.

He uses it to apologise for his crimes and says that while he hopes to be forgiven one day he believes he  deserves to die in agony like the victims he murdered and cooked.

In an excerpt from the memoir published in the Sun on Sunday newspaper, he writes: 'In the relative "twinkling of an eye" I will have to face my own death just like any other victim.

'I deserve to experience the same 
degree of pain suffered by my victims. Nothing less will suffice. Only 
my own death will eventually even the score and only at that point will
 I know that I am forgiven and really free of that burden of debt.

Postings on the blog suggest further 
material is due to be placed online over coming weeks.

  'I deserve to experience the same 
degree of pain suffered by my victims' - excerpt from Nilsen's  memoir

Nilsen, who grew up in Fraserburgh, 
Aberdeenshire, worked as an Army cook for 11 years before joining the 
Metropolitan Police for eight months and later the civil service.

Between 1978 and 1983, he killed at least 15 men and boys but claimed he could not remember the names of nine.

All his victims were students or 
mostly homeless men whom he took to his house either for sex or just for
 company. Once there, they were strangled or drowned.

Eventually, he would dismember them 
and hide the remains, storing these under floorboards or in bin bags 
stuffed into a wardrobe.

Seaton Sutherland, whose oldest brother 
Billy died at the hands of Nilsen, has broke his 30 years of silence to 
express the family’s shock at the ease with which sections of the 
self-serving and ‘pornographic’ autobiography had been posted on the 
internet sites.

He said: ‘This man is a 
monster and he should not be allowed a voice. This is attempting to 
glorify what he did, and it was the right decision to stop his 
autobiography ever being published.

‘It
 is disgraceful that reputable sites are being used to get round the ban
 and someone should do something to pull the plug on this before it goes
 any further.

'Gag the monster before it’s too late and before more 
damage is done.’
