A desire for sleek, straight hair has led to many women paying up to £400 for Brazilian blow-dry keratin treatments.

But now a UK-based company has created a breakthrough keratin product that promises to banish frizziness for 42 days … for just £14.99.

Since the Free From Frizz Six Week Blow Out went on sale at Boots three weeks ago, it has proved so popular that it is being sold at a rate of one every three minutes.

Fed up of the frizz? The new Free From Frizz 6 week Blow Out (right) is the UK's first home-based keratin treatment which claims to eliminate frizzy hair for more than 40 days

It is the UK’s first home-based 
keratin treatment which claims to banish frizziness for more than 40 
days; other products promise just a few hours.

Free
 From Frizz, which has taken five years to develop, is made by 
Kent-based beauty company Medichem. It was launched in the UK first and 
will go on sale in Europe in May.

It
 is estimated that five million women in the UK are prone to frizzy hair
 and more than 1.65million say frizziness is the number one thing they 
would change about their hair.

Frizz-free forever? The formula, which users 'paint on to their hair' accomplishes its frizz control and prevention by using a four part combination - a hair bond softening complex, heat, plant extracts and intensive conditioning

The
 frizz-free market is the fastest growing in haircare, with spending on 
hair-straightening formulas soaring to £287million last year.

Expensive
 Brazilian blow-dry keratin treatments have proved popular with 
celebrities, but in November Jennifer Aniston revealed that she had to 
cut her hair into a bob after it was damaged by one such treatment.

Unlike
 some Brazilian blow-dries, the Free From Frizz  product does not 
contain  formaldehyde. It comes in two bottles – one a pre-cleanser and 
the other a keratin treatment.

Frizzy hair can be caused by a range of environmental conditions, including dampness, heat, static, colouring or styling.

In
 a clinical eight-week trial overseen by Bruce Green, a member of the 
Royal Society of Chemistry, 20 volunteers with frizzy hair who tried the
 treatment still had sleek locks after six weeks.

Even after eight weeks, 14 of the 20 volunteers’ hair showed much less frizziness than normal.

Joe
 Mitchell, beauty innovations manager for Boots, said: ‘It’s great to be
 able to offer something that fights frizz in a different and effective 
way.’
