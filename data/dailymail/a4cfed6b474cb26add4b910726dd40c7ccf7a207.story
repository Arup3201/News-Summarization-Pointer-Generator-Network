The Scottish Government has reintroduced its plan for minimum alcohol pricing.

The SNP administration had been blocked by opposition parties when it tried to set a floor price per unit last year but now has a majority in the Scottish Parliament.

Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said it was time Scotland's 'unhealthy relationship with alcohol' was tackled.

However critics, including some drinks industry bodies, say the move will penalise responsible drinkers and will encourage people to go on cheap 'booze-runs' across the border to towns like Berwick-upon-Tweed and Carlisle.

Last year the price was expected to be set at 45p per unit but no official limit has yet been set.

An own-brand bottle of vodka increasing in price from from £8.35 to £11.85

A two-litre bottle of cider going up from £1.20 to £3.75

And the cost of a bottle of wine moving from £3.75 to £4.20

The policy has been widely supported by 
police and health professionals. The Liberal Democrat group has changed its position 
and is likely to support the Government too.

Ms Sturgeon said: 'We should not
lose sight of what has been achieved during the last four years. We 
have had a wide-ranging debate on alcohol pricing and there is now 
widespread recognition across the country of the need to tackle pricing.

'We have introduced a ban on quantity discounts and promotions in off-sales have been restricted, but already we have seen that without minimum pricing these attempts to take action on Scotland's alcohol problem are being undermined.

'By setting a minimum price for a unit of alcohol, we can raise the price of the cheap supermarket white ciders, lager and value spirits sought out by problem drinkers.

'I hope that this time around MSPs will do the right thing and back this policy that has the support of doctors, nurses, the police and growing numbers of the general population.'

Dr Brian Keighley, chairman of the British Medical Association in Scotland, said it was wrong that alcohol is sold at prices cheaper than fizzy drinks.

Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland's unhealthy relationship with alcohol must be tackled

He said: 'Without addressing price, many of the policies we've introduced already will be rendered less effective.

'There is an urgent need to legislate. For too long supermarkets have been piling it high, selling it cheap when it comes to alcohol.

'These retailers are already working 
on how to navigate the loopholes of the new laws on drinks promotions 
and it is clear that, by encouraging bulk-buying at low prices, these 
retailers are placing profit before public health.'

But
Jeremy Beadles, chief executive of the Wine and Spirits Trade 
Association, said the move means the majority of responsible drinkers 
will be punished by higher prices.

He said there was no evidence minimum pricing will address the problem and the most recent Government figures show alcohol consumption per capita fell in Scotland last year.

Mr Beadles added: 'The Scottish 
Parliament should insist on its right to review the policy and its 
impact on cross-border shopping, internet sales of alcohol and any 
evidence of illegal trade of alcohol in Scotland.'

The Government argues that alcohol-related problems cost Scotland £3.56 billion each year, equal to £900 for every adult.

Last year, MSPs did approve a ban on 
discount deals, such as two-for-one bottles of wine, and restricted 
'irresponsible' drinks promotions and advertising around premises.

The Bill established a requirement for age verification and paved the way for a new tax on licence holders, called a social responsibility levy. The tax aims to ensure retailers and licensed premises, such as nightclubs, contribute to the wider cost of their activities to the community.

The SNP pledged to push ahead with the alcohol price plan in its election manifesto. The party was elected with an unprecedented majority in May this year.

Gavin Hewitt, chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association, said minimum pricing was the wrong option.

He highlighted comments made last week by Westminster's Public Health Minister, Anne Milton, who said the plan is 'probably illegal' under European free trade rules.

Scottish Labour public health spokesman Dr Richard Simpson MSP said his party is still opposed to the policy and questioned whether the plan is legal.

Meanwhile, a leading academic on the alcohol industry and the chief executive of a brewery have backed the Scottish Government's plans to introduce minimum pricing.

Professor Tim Stockwell, director of the Centre for Addictions Research of British Columbia, said there is clear evidence that minimum pricing in Canada has significantly reduced alcohol consumption.

However, Rooney Anand, chief executive of brewer Greene King, which runs more than 2,000 pubs, restaurants and hotels in the UK, believes minimum pricing would 'go to the very heart' of the problems associated with excessive drinking.

Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: 'Cutting alcohol abuse is essential if we are to help people get on in the world. Too many Scots don't achieve all they can because they drink too much. Minimum pricing will help with this effort.'
