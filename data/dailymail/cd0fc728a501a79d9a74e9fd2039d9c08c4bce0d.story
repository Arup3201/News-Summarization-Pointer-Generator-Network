Keen walker: Sue Jones died after she fell into a waterfall. Her husband Malcolm jumped in to try to save her, but the current was too strong

A retired doctor has told how he desperately fought to save his wife when she fell into a waterfall but did not have the strength to pull her free from the strong current.

Malcolm and Sue Jones had been out walking with their dog near their Lake District home when she slipped and fell into the fast-flowing water, getting trapped face-down among some large boulders.

An inquest into her death was told that Dr Jones leapt into the waterfall but the current was so strong and the water so deep that he could not reach the mother-of-two.

Mrs Jones, 60, suffered fatal head injuries when she toppled into the water at Force Forge, Satterthwaite, Cumbria on January 11 this year, the inquest at Barrow Town Hall heard.

'We wanted to take the dog down a steep 
slope to a big pool so he could go in the water,' said 61-year-old Dr 
Jones.

'After he went in the water for a little bit we went back up.

'The dog was dawdling so Sue went ahead and I was about 20 yards behind.

'Then I heard a short scream and she was gone.'

Dr Jones, who said the couple had walked along the stream together 'many times', told the hearing that his wife became lodged face-down in the water against large boulders.

'The current was so strong and the water was so deep I just could not get to her,' he said.

The court heard Dr Jones lost his glasses and sustained a scratch to his forehead in his attempts to reach his wife.

The water eventually dislodged Mrs Jones’ body and she was washed down to the pool.

'I swam and grabbed her and pulled her to the edge. By then I was so cold I didn’t have the strength to pull her onto the bank,' he said.

The court heard Dr Jones had already realised that Mrs Jones was unlikely to be alive as she had been face down for so long.

'I turned her over and she wasn’t breathing and didn’t have a pulse,' he said.

Dr Jones lodged Mrs Jones’s body against the bank of the pool and went to get help.

Assistant coroner for south and east Cumbria, Mr Alan Sharp, read a statement from Lee Warren, who spotted Dr Jones by a roadside covered in blood from his head injury and soaking wet.

The statement said: 'He told me his wife had fallen and I think she’s dead.'

Mr Warren rushed down to the stream, pulled Mrs Jones from the water and delivered CPR.

Emergency services were called and she was taken to Royal Lancaster Infirmary,but was pronounced dead just hours later.

A post-mortem examination found the cause of death to be traumatic brain injury and fractured skull caused by hitting a large, sharp object.

Mr Sharp recorded a verdict of accidental death.

The couple, originally from Thame, Oxfordshire, had owned a holiday cottage in Satterthwaite for more than 12 years.

They made a permanent move to the area two years ago and spent their time renovating the old vicarage.

Speaking after his wife's death, Dr Jones had said: 'We have always travelled to the Lakes and we knew that we would eventually want to move here.'

'This was the house my wife had always had her eye on and so when it came onto the market we decided to take the opportunity to move here. It is a beautiful place to live, and Sue loved everything about it.'

He added: 'Sue loved developing the friendships she had made with the villagers.

'We felt very settled here, the community is very small and everyone welcomed us. Sue had a lot of good friends in our village.

'She
 was desperate for grandchildren, and she was just so excited to be 
helping in the pub - she had so much fun helping out. It gave us both a 
new lease of life really.'

The couple were joined later by their daughter Emma, 29, and her partner Simon Cole, who took over the village’s Eagles Head pub in November.

'We could only run a pub with the support of our family, and so we felt it was Satterthwaite or nothing,' said Ms Jones.

'My mum was so pleased to have us here, everything was working out and she had so many great ideas.'

The family said that housewife and enthusiastic cook Mrs Jones had been known for her ‘famous chocolate brownie’ which was a favourite on the pub menu.

'Her priority was her family and her friends,' said Ms Jones.

'She did everything for everybody and could never do enough for us.

'She
 spent so much time decorating the house it was just perfect, she was 
the most amazing host and loved having us all together as a family.'

Mrs Jones's son, paediatric doctor Andrew Jones, 32, who lives in south London with his wife Sonya, 31, said: 'She was very content and happy with what life had to offer right now. Emma and my mum were extremely close, and so when Emma and Simon decided to buy the pub it was the best thing that could have happened.

'She was thrilled to be helping out, everything was really busy and thriving for them.'

He added: 'She was a very soft, loving person who was elegant and beautiful inside and out. It is down to mum that we are such a close family, and so it is her legacy that we do her proud and stick together at this horrible time.

'She just wanted everyone to be happy, we have lost such a special person.'
