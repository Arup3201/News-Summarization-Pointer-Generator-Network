Improved car design and safety technology means that crash fatalities are in rapid decline, according to a new industry report.

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety found that in 2012 there were 28 driver deaths per million cars produced in 2011.

This compared to 48 for 2008 and 2009 vehicle models, marking a 41per cent decrease in motoring deaths over  three years of manufacturing.

Trend: Improved car design and safety technology means that crash fatalities are in rapid decline, according to a new industry report 

David Zuby, IIHS executive vice president and chief research officer, said of the findings: 'We know from our vehicle ratings program that crash test performance has been getting steadily better. 

'These latest death rates provide new confirmation that real-world outcomes are improving, too.' 

Crucial changes that could have saved lives include the redesign of airbags and seat belts. 

Many car brands worked at developing stronger structures and kitting models out with safety gizmos such as anti-lock brakes and electronic stability controls.

A weak economy was also attributed to the fall in motoring deaths as it could have led to a reduction in driving.

But the gap between safest and riskiest models remains wide. Three 2011 models had rates exceeding 100 deaths per million registered vehicle years.

The riskiest models also were mostly lower-priced, small cars, while the safest models were all mid-sized or large vehicles.

The nine models with zero deaths were the Audi A4 , Honda Odyssey, Kia Sorento, Lexus RX 350, Mercedes-Benz GL-Class, Subaru Legacy, Toyota Highlander hybrid, Toyota Sequoia and Volvo XC90.

Drop in deaths: Crucial changes that could have saved lives include the redesign of airbags and seat belts

The vehicles with the highest death rates were the Kia Rio, 149 deaths per million registered vehicles; Nissan Versa, 130 deaths, and Hyundai Accent, 120 deaths.

The institute has published death rates by make and model periodically since 1989, at first for cars only and later for all passenger vehicles. 

The rates include only driver deaths because the presence of passengers is unknown.

Although the latest numbers reflect 2011 models, the study included data from earlier-model year vehicles as far back as 2008 if the vehicles weren't substantially redesigned before 2011. 

Including older, equivalent vehicles increases the exposure and thus the accuracy of the results, the institute said. 

To be included, a vehicle must have had at least 100,000 registered vehicle years of exposure during 2009-12, or at least 20 deaths. 

The Insurance Institute for Highway safety examined fatalities involving 2011 model year vehicles, looking at how many driver fatalities occurred in a particular model over the course of a year of operation, expressed as a rate per million registered vehicle years.

Here are the 2011 vehicle models with highest and lowest death rates:
