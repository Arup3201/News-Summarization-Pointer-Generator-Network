Gerard Pique was left out of the starting line-up for the second successive game amid reports that Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal have submitted offers for the Barcelona defender.

Inexperienced Marc Bartra was asked to partner Javier Mascherano in the centre of defence for Wednesday's Champions League tie against Ajax.

And the decision by Barca boss Luis Enrique to leave Pique on the bench during Wednesday's 2-0 victory prompted Spanish newspaper AS to question whether he had a future at the Nou Camp.

It followed Pique being left in the stands for Saturday's shock 1-0 defeat against Celta Vigo in La Liga after TV images showed him using his telephone on the bench in the second half of the Catalan Super Cup final, a penalty shootout win over Espanyol last week.

Since the start of the season Pique has been left in little doubt that his place in the first team is anything but assured with Mascherano and  Jeremy Mathieu, signed from Valencia for £19million in the summer, preferred by Enrique.

Mathieu has been ruled out for up to three weeks by a leg injury but Pique appears to be out of favour which has alerted former club Manchester United, Man City and Chelsea.

Barcelona-based Sport claim that Chelsea and both Manchester teams have submitted offers ranging from £20m to £24m for the Spain star.

The newspaper say that Jose Mourinho is hoping to replace John Terry, and believes he can bring the Spaniard to London in the same way he lured Cesc Fabregas this summer.

Manchester City, meanwhile, are desperate to sign the Barca defender as early as January, Spanish newspaper Sport claim, having missed out on his signature last summer.
