A boyfriend told his partner he would 'teach her a lesson' during a drunken row before dousing her in petrol, setting her alight and locking her in a burning flat, a court has heard.

Rebecca Major, 32, survived by throwing a table through a window and jumping through from the upstairs flat but suffered 40 per cent burns and a fractured skull and sternum in the fall, Teesside Crown Court was told.

Her partner Edward McArthur, 40, from Darlington, denies attempted murder and arson with intent to endanger life.

Christine Egerton, for the prosecution, said the couple, who had been together for more than a year, were staying at McArthur's mother's flat.

On August 4 last year, they had both been drinking and when a row broke out McArthur lost his temper.

He left the room and came back with a container of petrol which he poured over his girlfriend's head, the jury heard.

Miss Egerton said: 'As he poured it over her, she felt it on her skin, she felt it in her eyes and it stung her. 

'At that stage she thought that was all he was going to do. She thought he was doing that, pouring that caustic substance on her, to shock her and that would be it.

'However, the next thing he did was to light it. He ran out of the door and locked her in the flat.

'She shouted after him thinking that he would come back and help her. He didn't.'

Ms Major used a wet towel and put it on her face as fire gripped the flat, then made her escape by smashing the window and falling to the ground.

The prosecution said McArthur 'hung around' after starting the fire and he told a police officer someone had thrown petrol into the flat. 

He said he had gone downstairs, heard an explosion and seen someone running away.

After he was arrested he did not answer the police questions, the jury heard.

He will claim in his defence he poured petrol over Ms Major 'to frighten her, not to injure her' and had then lit a cigarette which accidentally started the fire. 

He will say he helped Ms Major escape by kicking the window through, Miss Egerton said.

The prosecution said: 'Anyone who pours petrol over another person, as he did, and then sets fire to them, as he did, must have only one intention. That intention must be to kill that other person.

'Anyone who distributes a flammable liquid around a flat when somebody is in that flat must have an intention to endanger the life of another as a consequence of the fire starting.' 

Ms Major was still in a hospital gown, with thick bandages on her hands and an oxygen mask on when she was first videoed giving an interview to police.

In the recording played to the court, she  said: 'He basically told me to shut up. I was trying to calm him down. He went, 'I will teach you a lesson, you silly b****'.

'He went out of the room, came back in and poured petrol over me.

'I didn't think for one second he would light it. He lit the petrol and ran out of the door and locked it. I shouted 'Eddy, "please".

'The flat was on fire, it went up really quick. I panicked a bit and then I ran and got a cloth, wet it and put it over my face.

'I couldn't see because of the flames.'

She said the next thing she remembered after smashing the window and jumping was waking up in hospital.

She required skin grafts from her legs which were transferred to her arms.

Ms Major guessed McArthur's motivation to kill her was because he might have another woman, the court heard.

'He always said to me, "I will never let you have another one after me"', she said in the video.

In a second interview some weeks later, also filmed at the Burns Unit of the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle, she recalled McArthur telling her 'You will pay for this' before he fetched the petrol.

Still requiring oxygen, Ms Major remembered that some days before the attack, she found him with an axe and a petrol container in the flat. But she never thought he would use it on her.

She told detectives: 'I didn't know what I had done to deserve this. I'd not cheated on him. Nothing.

'It was horrible, I just thought, this is it, I've had it.'

She told the officers interviewing her in September she was in agony, and taking many painkillers. 

Crying, she said: 'I am angry. He has ruined me because I will never be what I was.'

She said they had argued before and their relationship was 'up and down'.

She told police: 'Normally when we argued he didn't raise his hand to me. From not doing anything to setting me on fire, it's crazy.' 

McArthur, of Darlington, denies attempted murder and arson with intent to endanger life.
