Two of Colombia's most famous exports Shakira and Sofia Vergara were revelling in their country's progression to the World Cup quarter-finals on Saturday night.

The pair took to social media in the immediate aftermath of the 2-0 win against Uruguay to gloat about the performance of Jose Pekerman's side.

Shakira, who is the partner of Spanish defender Gerard Pique, tweeted to her 25.7million followers straight after the game - paying particular tribute to goalscorer James Rodriguez.

'Weâ€™re in the quarters!,' it read. 'James, a huge thanks! So far the best in the world! Ospina, simply spectacular!! Shak'

Vergara, known for her lead role in US show Modern Family, posted a picture of herself wearing a Colombia shirt on instagram.

They face Brazil in the last eight this week with all the ingredients required to force an upset against the hosts.

Los Cafeteros comfortably dispatched a hapless Uruguay at the Maracana in the last-16 to reaffirm their credentials as potential winners.

Rodriguez, meanwhile, is set to attract a host of interest from clubs across Europe this summer after a string of assertive performances, including five goals in his four outings.
