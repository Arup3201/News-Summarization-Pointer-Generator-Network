A vast new hostel for cross-Channel migrants hoping to sneak into Britain is to be opened in Calais as temperatures are expected to plummet.

The 'cold weather emergency centre' in a 40,000sq ft warehouse fitted with beds and hot showers will be opened when temperatures fall below -5 centigrade.

It will be able to house 1,500 of the estimated 2,000 refugees currently living rough in the northern French port.

A vast new hostel for cross-Channel migrants hoping to sneak into Britain is to be opened in Calais; the hostel will be opened  as a 'cold weather emergency centre' and will feature beds and showers

Migrants line up for food in the northern French port; the centre will be able to house 1,500 of the estimated 2,000 refugees currently living rough in the northern French port

The centre will become the first large-scale shelter for Calais migrants since the controversial Sangatte Red Cross hostel was bulldozed in 2002.

That centre was used as a stepping stone to Britain by an estimated 18,000 refugees during its six years of operation.

Calais prefect Denis Robin said the centre, two miles from the town's ferry port, would be available for use within the 'coming days'.

He said: 'The cold weather plan will provide shelter for all those people left outside when temperatures fall.

'We need a space that can house around 1,500 people, that they can reach on foot, but one that is not in the town centre, because encouraging migrants to remain in the town centre is a sensitive issue in Calais.'

A separate day centre offering hot food and showers to only the most vulnerable women, children and elderly migrants will also be opened.

The British government has argued that providing beds and showers for migrants will only encourage more to come to Calais hoping to stow away aboard lorries and ferries to Dover.

But Mr Robin insisted the shelters were 'humanitarian gestures', adding: 'Neither of these centres are in any way new Sangatte-type hostels in Calais.'

Tensions have been mounting in the town in recent months as hundreds more refugees fleeing war zones in the Middle East and poverty in Africa flood across Europe.

Mass brawls between rival gangs left more than 70 people injured during July and August.

In October, Home Secretary Theresa May promised to give France £12million to tighten security in Calais after 250 illegal immigrants stormed the ferry terminal hoping to make it across the Channel.

The UK also offered Calais an 11-mile long high security fence used at a NATO summit in Wales to keep the migrants out of the terminal.

Calais Mayor Natacha Bouchart recently blamed the UK's 'generous' state benefits for their influx of refugees.

She said: 'Calais is a hostage to the British. The migrants come here to get to Britain.

'The situation here is barely manageable. The UK border should be moved from Calais to the English side of the Channel because we're not here to do their jobs.'
