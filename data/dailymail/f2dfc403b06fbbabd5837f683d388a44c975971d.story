Steffon Armitage’s shock move from Toulon to Bath was in danger of collapsing on Tuesday night amid a club versus country stand-off over the payment of a transfer fee.

The 29-year-old flanker had appeared to be on the verge of a sensational and immediate return to the Aviva Premiership in order to push for a place in England’s World Cup squad, as Bath attempted to hurriedly finalise a season-long deal.

However, after the initial European deadline for registering players passed at noon, the West Country club’s head coach Mike Ford suggested that the deal was close to being ‘dead in the water’.

If Armitage plays for Toulon against Montpellier in the opening round of the new Champions Cup on Sunday, he will be cup-tied and unavailable to represent Bath in European matches, at which point their pursuit of the openside will end. For now, it is thought that talks are on-going, but the sticking point appears to be the payment of a £300,000 fee to Toulon.

There are striking similarities between this case and that of Sam Burgess in the build-up to confirmation of his cross-code move to Bath earlier this year.

Dialogue has taken place between the men running the national set-up and their counterparts at Bath. The club are believed to be seeking financial input from the RFU on the basis that England stand to benefit from having renewed access to Armitage. However, as was the situation with the deal for Burgess, the union are adamant that they cannot have any direct involvement.

Ford claimed in an interview that ‘the RFU were trying to do the deal’, while initial reports in France suggested that officials from the union had made contact with Toulon about a potential release agreement.

But a source at Twickenham was adamant that the union’s chief executive Ian Ritchie has merely been kept informed about developments by his opposite number at Bath, Bruce Craig, adding: ‘We haven’t talked to Toulon.’

The RFU are well aware that any financial contribution would be seized upon by Bath’s Premiership rivals as favouritism and would undermine the integrity of the league. Ritchie is said to be absolutely adamant that a line cannot be crossed, even if it leads to long-term benefits for England.

So, despite the apparent will on all sides for the transfer to go through, it had reached an impasse on Tuesday night.

Armitage’s hopes of forcing his way back into World Cup contention and adding to his tally of five Test caps were hanging by a thread.

He had recently considered using a loophole in the eligibility criteria to switch Test allegiance to France, but he has had an abrupt change of heart.

Bath are pursuing Armitage as a replacement for their injured Springbok flanker, Francois Louw, but Ford said: ‘We haven’t signed him. We tried to and we have the ability to do so with our injury dispensation.

‘We’ve been looking around for a while and our owner, Bruce, thought of Steffon. We tried to make it happen and it was very, very close. Steff was excited to come here but it’s just not been done.

‘I understand there were financial reasons. It’s unfortunate, because we were so close to signing a great player, who could have helped club and country.

‘The RFU were trying to do the deal and Bruce has been dealing with that. From my point of view, if he plays for Toulon in the Champions Cup this weekend then I would be stupid to sign him because then he can’t play for us in Europe. If that happens then it’s dead in the water.’

Asked if that appeared likely, Ford added: ‘At this moment in time, yeah.’

Bath have emerged as title contenders in the early stages of this season — playing a daring brand of rugby based on predominantly English talent. Ford believes Armitage, the current European Player of the Year, could fit into his side well, as well as the England squad, and lamented the fact that he might not have the chance to do so.

He would have been a fantastic signing for Bath,’ Ford told Sky Sports News. ‘I spoke to Steff myself and over the weekend. He just wanted to come and play for Bath and have a shot at the World Cup, so I feel sorry for him that it’s not happened.

'What he’s done in the last few years has been brilliant and he is a world-class player. I think it would have been great for England as well, with a World Cup around the corner, for Stuart Lancaster to be able to pick a player of that potential.’

Early reports in France claimed that Saracens were also interested in signing Armitage, but that was flatly denied by their director of rugby Mark McCall. He said: ‘We weren’t involved and we won’t be involved. We are very happy with the back-row resources we have here.’

If there is to be another twist in this tale and a deal is eventually done, Armitage — a specialist openside poacher — could soon be a prime challenger for Chris Robshaw’s Test place, but the England captain appeared to relish the personal competition.

‘I played against Steffon quite a bit in schoolboy rugby so we crossed paths quite a bit and had quite a few good battles,’ he said.

‘He is a cracking player and if you look at what he has won in the last few previous years, it is pretty special.’

He has won countless personal awards and team prizes with Toulon, but what Armitage really craves is a shot at World Cup selection. It appears to be a fading fantasy.
