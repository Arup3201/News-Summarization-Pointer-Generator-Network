Kiaran Stapleton, 20, was asked his name when he appeared in the dock

The man accused of shooting a student in the head on Boxing Day gave his first name as ‘Psycho’ when he appeared in court yesterday charged with murder.

Kiaran Stapleton, 20, who lives in the Ordsall neighbourhood of Salford where 23-year-old Anuj Bidve was killed, was asked his name when he appeared in the dock.

He replied: ‘Psycho. Psycho Stapleton.’

The clerk at Manchester City 
Magistrates’ court then tried to clarify by asking: ‘Are you Kiaran 
Stapleton?’

The defendant replied: ‘No. Psycho Stapleton.’

He
was remanded in custody as police officers who had flown to India to 
meet Mr Bidve’s family apologised for delays in notifying them of his 
death and pledged to ensure his body is released to them as soon as 
possible.

Mr Bidve
had been part of a group of Indian students from Lancaster University 
visiting Manchester over Christmas who are understood to have been on 
their way to queue for the Boxing Day sales.

They
were walking through the tough Ordsall district at about 1.30am when Mr
Bidve was shot at close range in the side of the head.

The apparently motiveless killing 
generated national and international shock, especially in the victim’s 
home country. Police last week said they were treating the killing as a 
‘hate crime’ which may have been racially motivated.

A
£50,000 reward leading to a conviction, offered by police, still 
stands  – with the investigation into his murder said to remain ‘very 
much ongoing’.

Stapleton was charged with Mr Bidve’s murder on Sunday, and appeared in court yesterday for a special Bank Holiday hearing.

Security outside the court included several armed officers.

Having twice given his name as ‘Psycho Stapleton’ to the court clerk, the defendant confirmed his date of birth.

Stapleton refused to stand in the dock, saying: ‘I prefer to be seated.’

He was remanded in custody to appear 
before a judge at Manchester Crown Court today. Mr Bidve’s father 
Subhash, a former Indian Air Force officer who now runs an air 
conditioning firm, has been critical of police for failing to notify him
of the killing before he found out about it on Facebook.

The family have also appealed for his body to be released so Hindu funeral rites can be carried out.

Among their demands, Anuj's friends want his body returned as soon as possible, 1million rupees (£12,000) from the UK and Indian governments, and justice for his killer

Officers from Greater Manchester 
Police flew to meet them at their home in Pune yesterday. Assistant 
Chief Constable Dawn Copley said: ‘We felt it was important to make 
personal contact with the family and offer them every support we could 
at this difficult time.

‘We need to explain to them in person
where we are up to in the investigation and what we are doing to ensure
Anuj’s body is released to them as soon as possible.’

Afterwards Mr Bidve’s cousin Suruchi 
Wagh said: ‘We are very happy with the progress in the investigation of 
the case and would like the trial to finish soon so justice could be 
given to Anuj’s departed soul.

has been critical of the way the British and Indian authorities have handled the case

‘Police officers from Greater 
Manchester Police have today personally apologised to us and explained 
the situation which led to not informing the family.’

They said they had been assured Mr 
Bidve’s body should be released to the family today depending on the 
results of further post-mortem tests.

Mr Bidve was studying for a micro-electronics postgraduate qualification at Lancaster University.

A ‘peace march’ took place in New

candlelit vigil in Salford last night.

Organiser Vikran Gupta said: ‘I felt 
really sad about this unfortunate incident and that’s why I thought of 
organising something where we can join together and say our prayers for 
the one that’s gone.’

Three teenagers, one aged 16, two 
aged 17, who were arrested on suspicion of murder, have been bailed 
until March. A fourth man, aged 19, who was also arrested on suspicion of 
murder, has been  released and is not currently involved in the inquiry in any way.
