Experiencing different cultures and sampling local food is all part and parcel of travelling. And what's a holiday abroad without without trying out the local tipple? 

But alongside relatively harmless mixes like Spain's wine-based sangria and Sweden's fermented grain spirit Brännvin, sit some highly dangerous drinks. 

Indonesia for instance has arak, a potent rice liquor with 80 per cent alcohol content which when made into a cocktail, has lethal consequences.

Cheers! A holiday cocktail is nice - but would you brave one of these eight most dangerous drinks?

The drink, which according to Reuters caused the death of at least 25 people in 2009, is sometimes cut with methanol, which is highly toxic.

And living up to its name, the Zombie, invented in the 1930s by Donn Beach, is so strong that staff at Hollywood's Don The Beachcomber restaurant restrict customers to two apiece.

London has its own lethal liquid, too. The infamous Flaming Ferrari from South Kensington's Vietnamese restaurant and bar, Nam Long Le Shaker is said to floor its drinkers after three rounds. 

From Russia's Nicolashka and Chicago's vaportini to New Orleans's infamous Hand Grenade, these eight terrible tipples could leave their drinkers nursing more than just a sore head. 

Pretty but perilous: Lovely to look at and gorgeous on the tongue, the effect of drinking copious amounts of delicious concoctions can be felt the morning after

1. Arak Attack, Bali

Made primarily from the strong tasting arak, a locally distilled rice liquour with a mixers including lemonade, Pepsi or orange juice, this drink is mostly found in the bars of Kuta beach in Bali. 

The lethal cocktail is a perilous drink, and in 2009, at least 25 people died from alcohol poisoning after drinking it. The rice liquor itself has a strong, fruity note and has to be mixed with flavours which have a stonger aroma, such as lemonade or orange juice.

At 80 per cent proof, arak can sometimes be spiked with methanol, raising it to 140 per cent proof . An arak cocktail might cost anything from 8,000rp (41p), bought from a shack to 20,000rp (£1.03) purchased in a beach cafe.

2. Nicolashka, Russia

Typically an after-dinner drink, the Russian Nicolashka comprises a double shot of vodka, espresso powder, lemon and sugar. 

The concoction is consumed by first putting the lemon, sugar and coffee in the mouth, before taking one shot of vodka. The mixture is kept in the mouth and slowly chewed before being swallowed. The second shot of vodka comes swiftly after. 

It's a relatively simple drink but is strong, with drinkers claiming that keeping the alcohol in the mouth allows it to be absorbed faster into the blood stream. And while booze itself is said to slow the circulation, caffeine from the espresso, together with the vitamin C from the lemon, combine with the sugar to increase blood circulation, making the alcohol reach the brain swiftly.

Citrus, sugar, coffee and vodka come together swiftly and cause an almost immediate effect 

The Russian Nicolashka is rumoured to have been invented by Czar Nikolaus II

3. Hand Grenade, New Orleans, US

Sold only in five licensed bars in the New Orleans French Quarter - Tropical Isle Original, Tropical Isle Original Papa Joe’s, Tropical Isle Bayou Club & Music Bar, the Funky Pirate, and the New Orleans Grapevine - this melon-flavoured drink was created by husband and wife team Pam Fortner and Earl Bernhardt in 1984. 

The $8 (£5) cocktail is usually served in a green plastic yard glass and includes equal parts gin, grain alcohol, melon liqueur, rum and vodka. Sweet and potent, the full recipe is a trade secret and bar employees and licences have to sign confidentiality agreements pledging not to reveal it.

4. Death In The Afternoon, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia

A classic concoction of champagne and absinthe, this mind-blowing luxe cocktail was invented by Ernest Hemingway and is also called Hemingway Champagne. 

Relatively simple to make, the recipe's original instructions appear in 1935 cocktail book and were contributed by Hemingway himself, who wrote: 'Pour one jigger absinthe into a champagne glass. Add iced champagne until it attains the proper opalescent milkiness. Drink three to five of these slowly.'

The drink rarely appears in bar menus but can usually be ordered from Sky Bar Kuala Lumpur's bartenders for the princely sum of RM67 (£13).

5. Vaportini, Chicago, US

A new trend to emerge in the Chicago drinking scene, customers don't actually drink this. Instead, they take in alcohol vapour directly into the bloodstream. 

Julie Palmer – former co-owner of Kiva Bar where the 'cocktail' is available – created the glass globes from which the spirits are inhaled. The globes are filled with a shot of liquor, and rest on top of a pint glass. The heat from a candle at the bottom of the glass turns the liquor into fumes, which 'drinkers' then inhale through a glass straw.

Health experts however have warned against this practice as there is a high risk of alcohol poisoning with the inhalation method as it bypasses the body's natural defense mechanisms against alcohol poisoning.

6. Singapore Sling, Singapore

A south-east Asian cocktail, this long drink costs more than $26 Singapore dollars (£13) and was developed by a Hainanese bartender in 1915 at the Long Bar in Raffles Hotel, Singapore.

Initially called a gin sling, the drink itself doesn't contain vast amounts of alcohol but the high sugar content makes it an intoxicating brew. 

According to DA Embury, author of cocktail tome the Fine Art Of Mixing Drinks, there are not two recipes alike published for the drink. Singapore Sling is still served in the hotel and contains two measures of gin, one of cherry brandy, one measure of herbal liqueur Bénédictine and is topped off with fresh pineapple juice.

7. Flaming Ferrari, London, UK

The infamous haunt of city slickers in the the decadent eighties, Nam Long Le Shaker in Old Brompton Road, South Kensington serves the equally as infamous Flaming Ferrari, a fiery concoction of green Chartreuse, Curaçao, Woods 100 Navy Rum and Grand Marnier. 

The £19 drink arrives flaming at the table and is strong enough to floor the hardiest of drinkers. Word of warning: rumours abound of customers blacking out after drinking three so it might be best to stick just to the one.

8. Zombie, California, US

A smooth, fruity cocktail originally served heated, the Zombie was concocted in the 1930's by Donn Beach, a restaurant owner in Hollywood. The cocktail's ingredients are a heavily guarded secret as Mr Beach was very cautious with his recipe. 

According to the original recipe, published in drinks book Sippin' Safari, the drink was made from three different kinds of rum, lime juice, falernum, Angostura bitters, Pernod, grenadine, and 'Don's Mix,' a combination of cinnamon syrup and grapefruit juice. 

The cocktail is so strong that Don The Beachcomber restaurants limit their customers to two Zombies apiece.
