Roy Keane was on the touchline for Aston Villa's clash with Stoke as he made his first competitive outing in his new role as Paul Lambert's assistant manager.

And it looks as if the former Manchester United midfielder has lost none of that competitive spirit on his return to the Premier League.

Keane was on his feet at The Britannia Stadium making his feelings known - something fans will be very familiar with from his playing days.

Keane sat alongside Paul Lambert in the visitors' dugout and was more than willing to help out his new leading man.

And Lambert seems to be enjoying the Irishman's company -  describing him as less serious than most people think ahead of the game. 

'He loves a laugh, he's not just serious,' Lambert told the Daily Star. 'It's been great for me and everyone else at the club. It's been good.

'I think he's given everybody a boost, he's given the whole club a good lift.

Let me show you the ropes: Lambert has a word in Keane's ear ahead of the game at the Britannia
