Two people were killed yesterday afternoon when a rally car ploughed into a crowd of spectators in southern France.

It is believed that 17 others were injured, including children, at the crash in Plan-de-la-Tour near Toulon on the Mediterranean coast.

It appears the driver made a mistake at an intersection where cars were supposed to turn right and instead drove straight ahead, crashing into bystanders.

One of the dead was reported to be a rally marshall.

A witness said: ‘It crashed into a first row of spectators before peeling off and mowing down other people.’

Fire stations deployed about 50 rescue workers to the site, and some of the victims were rushed to hospitals.

The Var Rally is not a major road race in France, but as in others held in the country a major challenge is for the drivers to navigate narrow roads through rural areas at high speed as spectators watch, often from the sidelines.

Plan-de-la Tour, located near Toulon city, gained international attention several years ago when American actor Johnny Depp and singer Vanesa Paradis bought a house there.
