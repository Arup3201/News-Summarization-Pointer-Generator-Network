The Mexican government will use satellite technology to stem the tide of illegal immigrants fleeing to America on top of huge freight trains nicknamed La Bestia or ‘The Beast’.

People desperate to escape the poverty of the south clamber aboard the slow-moving trains and sit on the roof as they trundle north towards the US-Mexican border.

The trains are also used by traffickers to get people into the United States.

Announcing $450,000 to be spent on improving tracks that have been neglected for years in six southern states, Humberto Mayans, the head of the federal government's southern border improvement plans, said that a dozen satellite-monitored vehicles will be used ahead of cargo trains near Mexico's southern border with Guatemala.

It is here that many of the immigrants get onto the trains as they head north.

The Beast stops at Ixtepec, Mexico and yet more illegal immigrants - from the old to the very young - clamber aboard on their way to the US-Mexico border where they will try to illegally enter America

The new scheme is meant to 'prevent migrants from putting at risk the safety of the trains which are for cargo, not passengers,' Senor Mayans said.

The improvements will prevent derailments and allow the trains to speed up thus preventing people climbing aboard in the first place. Some of the immigrants are robbed and assaulted by gangs who control the train tops, while others fall asleep and fall off losing limbs or being crushed under the wheels of the trains.

The number of migrants increased at the beginning of this year but has dropped over the past couple of months.

It is believed that the drop is due to more stringent border patrols, raids on The Beast, drug gangs, coyotes and an American-financed advertising campaign warning of the dangers of the journey.

Last month, President Enrique Pena Nieto announced that he would try to secure Mexico’s border with Guatemala and introduce better border crossing facilities and improved regional co-operation.

End of the line (almost): The Beast arrives at  Ixtepec, Mexico. From there the illegal immigrants will begin their final assault on America - and a new life or a daily battle with immigration agents from the Department of Homeland Security who will attempt to track, detain and deport them

It is so slow that thousands of illegal immigrants can clamber aboard

It's a freight train so they face possible death by sitting on its roof, which is controlled by gangs
