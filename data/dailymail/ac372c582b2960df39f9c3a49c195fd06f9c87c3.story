Young children are the biggest texters in Britain, sending an average of 193 text messages a week - double the number they sent last year, telecom regulator Ofcom has revealed.

The figure for boys and girls aged between 12 and 15 is nearly four times the UK average of 50 texts a week.

Girls are more enthusiastic texters than boys, according to the survey from Ofcom.

Young children are the biggest texters in Britain, sending an average of 193 text messages a week -with 12 to 15 year old girls topping the table

For the first time, Ofcom has researched the media habits of 3-4 year 
olds.

One in ten (9%) 3-4 year olds use a tablet at home, according to their 
parents.

Over a third (37%) are going 
online using a desktop PC, laptop or netbook.

This is possibly to do 
activities such as look at a website, watch a TV programme or play games
online, Ofcom believes.

Girls between 12 and 15 send more than 30 texts a day - 35 per cent more than boys in the same age group - and some older girls send an average of 221 messages a week.

But younger children are also sending far more texts than last year, researchers found.

The average child aged between eight and 11 sends 41 texts a week - double the number sent in 2011, when the figure was 23.

The report discovered there has been an explosion in the use of tablet computers among children of all ages.

Researchers found that the number of children aged between five and 15 using tablets has tripled since last year.

Fourteen per cent of all children now use a tablet at home.

More are also using the internet.

Youngsters between 12 and 15 are for the first time spending as much time on the net - often accessed through their mobile phone - as they spend watching TV.

This adds up to 17 hours a week on each.

Claudio Pollack, Ofcom’s consumer group director, said: 'Our latest research shows that children’s take-up and use of different media is growing at a rapid pace, with some areas such as texting and smartphone ownership fast outstripping the general population.

'However, children are not just using more media. They are also adopting some forms at a very young age.

'This highlights the challenge that some parents face in keeping up with their children when it comes to technology and in understanding what they can do to protect children.'

The number of children in the 12 to 15 age bracket who own a smartphone has increased by 50 per cent since last year. Now nearly two-thirds of children in this age group have one - up 41 per cent compared with last year.

This is far higher than the UK average for adults of 45 per cent.

A brother, aged 4, and sister, aged 1, play with an iPad and iPhone. Researchers today said that one in ten 3-5 year olds use a tablet.

Mobile phones are the most vital device for them - even more important than TV.

Two-thirds say they would miss their mobile phone most - up from a quarter last year.

Younger children say they would miss TV the most.

The average child aged between five and 15 watches TV for an estimated 16 hours a week.

Older children, aged between 12 and 15, spend most time watching it - 17.3 hours a week.

Since 2007, there has been a decline in the number of children watching TV in their bedrooms.

The number of children aged between five and seven watching in bedrooms has fallen from 52 per cent to 43 per cent; the number of children aged between eight and 11 watching in bedrooms has fallen from 69 per cent to 58 per cent; and the number of children aged between 12 and 15 watching in bedrooms has fallen from 81 per cent to 73 per cent.
