Injuries: Kathleen Allegrone, 70, was left with a bloody nose after being thrown to the ground

A police officer has been filmed violently body-slamming a 70-year-old woman face-first onto the pavement after stopping her for drunk driving.

Kathleen Mary Allegrone was left with a bloody and bruised nose after Kevin Jones from the Glynn County Sheriff's Office threw her to the ground on St. Simons Island, Georgia on December 5.

Despite the apparently brutal act, which was caught on camera by a passerby, the sheriff's office concluded that Jones acted reasonably and he has been allowed to continue working.

The video shows Allegrone struggling with the officer as he leads her, handcuffed, to his patrol car before throwing her into the air and onto the street, her face hitting the ground with a smack.

'The lady was being handcuffed and did not have her arms to break her fall,' a witness said.

The cameraman's friend added to First Coast News: 'I was stunned really. I think everyone was.'

But the Glynn County sheriff's office insisted that Jones acted reasonably as Allegrone had become violent during the arrest.

Police
Chief Matt Doering told the Florida Times-Union that Allegrone
had locked herself inside her car after being pulled over for drunk 
driving and officers had to use an unlock tool to open a door.

'Attack': A passerby captured the moment officer Kevin Jones threw her to the ground for resisting him

As Jones removed Allegrone from the 
car, he sustained lacerations to his hand as she dug her nails into him,
Doering wrote in his report.

She continued to resist their arrest - as seen in the video posted to YouTube - and continued to dig her nails into the officer's hand and wrist, according to the report.

To
stop her hurting him, Jones threw Allegrone to the pavement to stop the
assault - and he was justified in doing so, Doering wrote.

Jones
had initially been taken off patrol as police investigated his conduct 
but he returned to full duties on Saturday, nine days after the 
incident.

After the police officer threw the 
woman on the ground, another cop walked over to the man who was 
recording with his cell phone and asked him to stop.

'It's not against the law, though,' the witness told the officer.

'I
know it's not against the law. I'm just asking you not to do it,' the 
officer said. 'I cannot stop you but all I can say is that if it was 
your friend over there or if it was yourself would you want this 
happening?'

The young man tried to reply but was cut off as the officer demanded: 'Yes or no, sir! Yes or no, sir!'

Allegrone
was arrested and booked into the Glynn County jail on charges of driving under the influence and felony 
obstruction of a police officer.

She was released on bail later that day.
