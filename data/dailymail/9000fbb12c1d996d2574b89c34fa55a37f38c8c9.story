A new and unlikely fashion trend has emerged in Colorado for sporting jewelry in the shape of IUDs - birth control implants otherwise known as intrauterine devices.

Wearing the glittery, brightly-colored objects as earrings or, in the case of men, lapel pins, is a show of support for a new bill which would plunge $5million in state funding into a program which supplies this form of birth control to low-income women.

The jewelry has been purchased by more than 200 lobbyists and lawmakers in favor of the Colorado Family Planning Initiative, from web retailer Etsy, and is crafted out of resin by Dr Virginia Smith, an OB-GYN based in Ohio.

IUDs are small T-shaped implants which, when inserted into the uterus, prevent pregnancy from occurring for between three and 12 years, or simply until removed.

IUDs (intrauterine devices) are small T-shaped implants which are fitted into the uterus to prevent pregnancy.

They work by interfering with the way sperm usually fertilize an egg, and are more than 99% effective. 

IUDs last anywhere between two and 12 years, depending on the type.

The implants must be fitted and removed by licensed healthcare providers. 

Once they are removed, a woman can generally become pregnant straight away. 

The Colorado Family Planning Initiative has handed out an estimated 30,000 of these contraceptives since its inception in 2009, and up until now, has been grant-funded.

According to ThinkProgress, this program has contributed to a 40per cent drop in teen births over the past five years.

The new legislation, expected to be introduced on Friday, would allocate $5million of state funds to the cause, allowing IUDs to be fitted for free or at little cost in 68 clinics across Colorado.

Some conservatives and anti-choice lawmakers, however, stand against the program, with some - including Republican Senator Kevin Lundberg - even incorrectly claiming IUDs cause abortions.

Dr Jennifer Hyer, a Denver-based OB-GYN, dismissed these claims as neither 'medically' nor 'scientifically' accurate, in a statement distributed by NARAL Pro-Choice Colorado.

'They are among the most effective forms of contraception, especially for at-risk women, because they automatically prevent pregnancy,' she said.

Republican House Rep. Don Coram is actually in disagreement with members of his own party on this issue, and has taken to wearing one of Dr Smith's IUD pins on his lapel as a sign of his support for the bill. 

'A redneck Republican wearing an IUD - it just doesn't make sense does it?' Mr Coram told The Herald. 

'Seriously though, I think this is one of the most important bills we are looking at.' 

Dr Smith, who has seen business for her IUD jewelry go through the roof recently, told ABC's 7News Denver: 'I think women should have access to options and so if this promotes access to options then I think that is a good thing.'
