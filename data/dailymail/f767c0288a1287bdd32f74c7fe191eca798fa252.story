Holy Safari: OJ Simpson wants to host a television show as he travels the world interviewing religious ideologues and luminaries such as the Pope

OJ Simpson’s religious rebirth behind bars has seen him counsel fellow inmates and convert a white supremacist to Christianity – and now he wants to take his show on the road for television.

Simpson, 66, has always been religious, but his five years behind bars have given him time to focus on religion and have brought him closer to God, MailOnline has learned. Expecting to be out of prison by Christmas, he plans to host a tv show called ‘Holy Safari,’ according to his promoter.

The former NFL great now spends his time reading multiple versions of the Bible, even the Quran, and giving advice to and converting fellow inmates, promoter Norman Pardo told MailOnline before comparing ‘The Juice’ to a prophet.

Originally reported by the National Enquirer, Mr Simpson has become very religious behind bars. As a decision on the appeal of his armed robbery and kidnapping convictions nears, the groundwork is being laid for a return to the spotlight.

‘He’s always been religious inside of the prison,’ Mr Pardo said. ‘He helps people who can’t find their way.’

One of those people was a cellmate of OJ’s the first year he was locked up, Mr Pardo boasted.

A white supremacist, Mr Simpson was able to convert the man to Christianity, one of many converts during ‘The Juice’s time in the pokey.

A message left with a Nevada Department of Corrections spokesperson seeking comment on Mr Simpson’s religious activities behind bars was not immediately returned.

The footballer’s awakening hasn’t happened since he was in prison, he has always been religious according to Mr Pardo. The promoter said he has known Mr Simpson since the late 1990s.

‘Most people just think of him as a murderer because they don’t know the other side,’ he added.

‘Holy Safari,’ a television show in development that was weeks commencing production before Mr Simpson was sent to the slammer, is Mr Simpson’s likely destination, Mr Pardo said.

The gregarious promoter kept in touch with the Hall of Famer while he was in prison, even visiting a few times.

Initially slated to go on a now-defunct television station, the show will feature OJ traveling the world exploring local ideologies and interviewing religious leaders – including the Pope, according to Mr Pardo.

The promoter even insists that religious people are behind the project.

‘There’s a lot of religious people who are behind this,’ he said. ‘They feel if OJ found the lord, it’s important.’

Despite what will likely be a negative reaction to putting the former Buffalo Bills running back on television, Mr Pardo insists Mr Simpson is the best man for the job.

‘Most all networks need ratings, and OJ is the hottest rated thing you’re gonna get,’ he boasted.

Comparing Mr Simpson to Job, Mr Pardo said the footballer is the best person for the message of God.

‘This man has had everyone taken from him… this is the man that can be the evangelist.’

‘Nobody could have been through as much as him and kept their faith,’ Mr Pardo continued.

Characterized by Ozzie Fumo, an attorney for Mr Simpson, as a 'hanger-on' trying to profit off OJ's name, Mr Pardo countered that he has never made a cent off the former NFL star in the 20 years he has known him.

'I have nothing to gain, I’ve never made a dollar off OJ,' said Mr Pardo. 'When I took OJ on tour, I paid all the bills for all the limos and all that.'

'I could tell you more about OJ Simpson than those attorneys would ever know,' Mr Pardo continued. 'I spent 20 years with him in limos, on buses, at his home, him at my home - I even went to graduations.'

No networks have expressed interest in the show as of yet, but Mr Pardo chalks that up to the reformed running back still being behind bars.

He insists that OJ Simpson going to jail is actually an advantage in pitching the the project to networks.

‘It’d have to be the guy on the bottom, and you can’t get much farther from the bottom than OJ right now.’
