Fighting off crocodiles and sharks was all in a day's work for Jason Beachcroft during his epic sea kayaking adventure around Australia over the past 17 months.

Jason Beachcroft has completed the first sea kayak circumnavigation of Australia, to have included Tasmania, arriving back in Rose Bay, Sydney this afternoon, where he began his mission on January 12 last year.

The incredible feat has been accomplished three other  times before but has never included the treacherous trek across the Bass Strait and back again.

Beachcroft said the stretch was often referred to as ‘The Everest of the Australian sea kayaking’.

But tackling the waters was well worth it as the scenery he paddled through in western Tasmania was the biggest highlight of the entire trip for the 45-year-old.

Beachcroft described the remote and wild parts of southern and western of Tasmania as ‘stunningly beautiful’.The Kimberleys in north Western Australia came in as a close second for the same reasons.

The seed was planted for Beachcroft a few years ago when he read Kiwi sea kayaker Paul Caffyn’s book on his adventures when he circumnavigated the country – minus Tasmania.

One of the most confronting and surreal moments of his long voyage was fighting off a crocodile in northern Western Australia.

Beachcroft was camped up a hill when he heard his kayak being moved in the middle of the night and went down to discover a crocodile was pulling his boat into the water.

In a lucky escape, Beachcroft managed to hit the predator on the head with a hand spear that was attached to his kayak.

‘I wasn’t feeling fear – it was only two metres - I’m not concerned until they are at least four metres,’ he said. ‘I was just thinking “I need my boat and the food on it”.’

It wasn’t the only time the kayaker had an encounter with a member of the large reptile family – he also paddled right over the top of a crocodile while at Gantheaume Point in Broome.

It wasn’t unusual for sharks to take a bite out of the kayak – something that Beachcroft experienced at least 50 times.

‘They are attracted to the rudder but once they realised they can’t eat it they usually swim away,’ Beachcroft said. ‘But this one stupid bronze whale shark kept biting so I had to whack it on the nose.’

Another challenging moment was when he broke a couple of ribs in South Australia after he hit the side of his kayak during rough surf conditions which slowed him down for about five weeks.

Despite being a solo quest, Beachcroft wasn’t entirely alone with 'Omarm the Pirate Monkey' given to him as a travelling companion for the trip.

Beachcroft is not a stranger to the outdoor life – he is going back to his job working as an outdoor guide in the Blue Mountains.

There was not a single point throughout the voyage that the intrepid adventurer had any regrets or even thought for a second about giving it all up.

‘I’ve been told I’m determined,’ he admitted.

But he did miss the usual pleasures such as his own bed and being able to kick back and watch a movie, and not so typically – rock climbing.

Despite roughing it for the best part of a year and a half, Beachcroft is not heading straight to a health spa for a pamper treatment but hitting the ski fields in Jindabyne.

‘I find skiing relaxing,’ he said.
