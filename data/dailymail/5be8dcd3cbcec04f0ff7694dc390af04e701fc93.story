Accused: Ross Knowles is alleged to have siphoned off funds meant for big energy companies

A council energy chief who allegedly embezzled more than £2million by cashing invoices into his personal account spent the money on expensive cars and luxury holidays, a court heard.

Ross Knowles, a 42-year-old boss at Kent County Council, is alleged to have siphoned off funds meant for big energy companies - which he used to buy a Jaguar car and trips abroad.

The respected 'golden boy' of his sector cashed in invoices for as much as £400,000-a-time into his own personal account, a court was told.

A jury heard that British Gas and NPower were two of the companies he defrauded, before being caught out.

Knowles
worked with the Local Authority South East Region (Laser) buying energy
for Kent County Council in 2007, Maidstone Crown Court heard.

Over
a 14-month period, Knowles - who earned a salary of £66,000 a year - 
extracted more than £2million and kept it for himself, the court was 
told.

Allison Clare, prosecuting, told the jury that the Cambridge graduate was regarded as 'a bit of a star' and a 'golden boy'.

She said: 'He was a huge asset to Laser, everybody thought. That may be why he was able to perpetrate the fraud.

'The essence of the fraud is really very simple.'

Knowles would ask British Gas and 
NPower to add an extra charge at their end of their dealings as a 
'comfort blanket', Miss Clare told the court.

This was meant to be reclaimed by Kent County Council and Laser at the end of the year.

Miss Clare added: 'British Gas charged that extra amount and during the course of the year a huge amount built up as a result.'

After a year of the contract running, Knowles submitted an invoice for repayment of part of the money - totalling £400,000.

But the court heard he paid that into his own personal account.

Miss Clare said: 'It is a remarkably simple way of him extracting money and taking it for himself.

'In a 14-month period, he manages to extract from British Gas over £2million.'

The court was told that he used a similar method with NPower - extracting £187,000.

Miss Clare said £376,000 of the money was spent on a Jaguar car and luxury holidays.

He
is also alleged to have splurged his illgotten gains to his mother and 
sons, his solicitor over a dispute with his ex-wife and £39,000 in cash 
withdrawals.

Knowles, of Allington, Maidstone, denies two fraud charges.

The trial continues.
