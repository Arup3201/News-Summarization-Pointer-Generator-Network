Police in Georgia issued an Amber Alert on Thursday for two young brothers believed to have been abducted by their father, who is considered armed and dangerous.

Ben Cleary, aged nine, and his seven-year-old brother, Henry, spent their Christmas break with their father, 46-year-old Daniel Cleary, in Roswell.

The children were supposed to be back with their mother in Suwanee on Wednesday, but police say Daniel Cleary failed to return them to his ex-wife.

Wanted: Daniel Cleary, left, is believed to have abducted his two sons, Henry and Ben, right, after failing to return the boys to his ex-wife at the end of their weeklong stay 

Roswell police issued the nationwide Amber Alert, known in Georgia as Levi’s Call, after discovering that Mr Cleary violated a court order by not communicating with the boy's mother, Theresa Nash, for several days about the whereabouts of their children.

Officials believe Clearly is armed and may pose a danger to his sons .

'He bought a Glock a month ago,' Theresa Nash told WTVM. 'He is drinking. He is under extreme stress because he probably realizes that he's kidnapped the kids and there's now an Amber Alert.'

Ben Cleary is described as 4 feet 8 inches tall, weighing 66lbs, with brown eyes, and brown medium length hair. He was last seen wearing a light blue winter vest.

Henry Cleary stands at 4 feet 5 inches and weighs 60 lbs, with green eyes, brown medium length hair. He, too, was last seen wearing a light blue winter vest.

Their father picked the kids up on December 19 and was supposed to return them to Nash by 2pm on December 26, but never made it.

Distraught: The boys' mother, Theresa Nash, said her ex-husband, a recovering alcoholic, had recently bought a Glock hangun, and she fears for her son's safety

Getaway car: Police believe that Cleary ditched his car and switched to a 2002 silver Jeep Grand Cherokee, similar to this one, with temporary Georgia license plate No 10742627

The woman said that she last heard from her ex-husband on December 22 when he called her to say that he and the boys will be spending a night at a Quality Inn motel in Chattanooga, Tennessee, after visiting the Tennessee Aquarium in town, according to 11Alive. 

Cleary made one final call from his cell phone on December 23 from Nashville, after which the device was shut off.

With mounting concern, Theresa Nash drove to Roswell and went to Cleary’s home at 285 Crab Orchard Way, only to discover that the house had been cleared out and there was no one there, MyFoxAtlanta reported.

Troubled relationship: Cleary regained joint custody of his sons only in October after a stint at a rehab facility, and the Christmas break was the first week the kids spent alone with their father

Cleary’s car was later found abandoned in a restaurant parking lot, leading police to believe that he may have switched vehicles to travel in a 2002 silver Jeep Grand Cherokee with temporary Georgia license plate No 10742627 on Interstate 40 west of Nashville, Tennessee. 

Theresa Nash said her ex-husband does not have any family in Tennessee, but he does have relatives in Nevada, Florida and California.

Nash said that a friend of Cleary's confirmed to her that the 46-year-old man purchased a Glock handgun last month, and she said that police said that the firearm was on him.

The mother also added that Cleary, whom she described as an alcoholic, had recently undergone treatment at a rehab facility in California, KOLO8 reported. The man regained shared custody of Henry and Ben only in October, and the Christmas break was their first week alone with their father.

Nash said her ex-husband is volatile and that she cannot be certain he won’t cause harm to the children.

‘I can’t predict his behavior with logic. It always defies me when I try, so I don’t have certainty that he wouldn’t,’ she said. “He loves them very much but he is not of sound mind.’

According to court records obtained by Channel 2, Nash filed a petition for contempt against Cleary last November.

The document stated  that the woman smelled alcohol on his breath when he went to pick up the children, so she refused to let Cleary take them. The petition, however, was denied.
