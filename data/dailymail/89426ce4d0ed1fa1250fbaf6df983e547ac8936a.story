Many people will know the embarrassment of being asked if they're pregnant, when in fact they're just carrying a few extra pounds.

However few will have reacted quite like one mother-of-three, who lost a staggering 10 stone after her son asked her if she was having a baby.

Gemma Davies, from Llanelli, South Wales, was so shocked by her then 10-year-old son’s words that she signed up to a local slimming group to shift her 21 stone weight.

Slimming down: Gemma Davies, 29, was 21 stone and lost 10 stone dropping from a size 24 to a 10 after her son asked her if she was pregnant

Embarrassed by her size 24 figure, the 
married 29-year-old ditched her junk food stash of crisps, sweets and 
chocolate and lost 10 stone within a year.

Now 11 stone and a size 10, Gemma said: 'I couldn’t believe it when my son Matthew asked if I was having another baby.

'I was doing the school run in December 2012, and I was so embarrassed. I knew I was fat but my kids had never said anything about my weight before.

'I told Matthew that mummy’s belly was just a bit big - but the words hurt.'

The full-time mother to Matthew, 11, Thomas, 8 and Olivia, 18 months, had spent years convincing herself that she was happy with her 21 stone figure.

Gemma’s weight problems began aged 17, when she fell pregnant with Matthew.

As she was: Gemma Davies, from Llanelli, South Wales, was so shocked by what her son said that she signed up to a local slimming group in an attempt to shift the 21 stone she had put on through eating badly

Then a trim 9 stone, Gemma ate cakes and chocolate to satisfy her pregnancy cravings. Speaking about her weight gain, she said: 'Before I knew it, I’d piled on six stone.

‘I felt very lonely as a single mum, so I’d raid the supermarket shelves for whatever chocolate bars or ready meals I wanted.

'My family didn’t want to upset me, so no-one ever said anything about my weight. But at family gatherings they’d pass their leftovers down the table for me to finish.'

In just a year, 5 ft 8” Gemma shot up to 21 stone, and felt ashamed of her size 24 figure. Soon after, she met her future husband, Stuart, 32, and put on more weight.

She said: 'Stuart loved me exactly the way I was, and I didn’t have to hide my weight struggles with him.

'But when I fell pregnant with our son Thomas, I was too busy to cook proper meals. I’d make the boys a healthy dinner, but we would scoff late night takeaways after they’d gone to bed.

'I kept telling myself that I was happy - but in the back of my mind I knew my weight was out of control.'

Gemma and Stuart tied the knot in March 2012 whilst she was pregnant with their daughter, Olivia.

Despite slimming down to a size 20, she says she was still embarrassed about her body and hid her figure under swathes of fabric.

Soon she was ordering takeaways four nights a week and drinking cans of Coke for a quick energy fix.

Support: Gemma said her husband Stuart 
refused to let her order takeaways, and the boys were telling her to 
slow down because she was walking so quickly on the school run in a bid 
to lose weight - and it paid off

Gemma was walking the boys to school one morning when she was taunted by a gang of teens about her figure.

Recalling the event, she said: 'They were mocking me by singing Mika’s ‘Big Girl (You Are Beautiful)’.

'I knew they were making fun of me, but I just put my head down and carried on walking. I was so embarrassed, and I wanted my kids to have a mum who wasn’t out of breath chasing after them.'

After hearing her son’s honest remarks about her figure, Gemma finally vowed to lose the pounds.

She cleared the cupboards of junk food, binned the takeaway menus and walked two miles to her local town every day.

Gemma said: 'When Matthew asked if I was pregnant it finally dawned on me. I signed up to a local slimming club there and then because I wanted to be a mummy that my kids could be proud of.

'My husband Stuart refused to let me order takeaways, and the boys were telling me to slow down because I was walking so quickly on the school run.'

After just 12 months of healthy eating and daily walks, Gemma has halved her body weight and dropped to a size 10.

She said: 'It’s the most incredible feeling, and I have so much confidence now. Stuart is amazed every time I wear a new outfit, and the boys are proud to see mummy waiting for them at the school gates.

'They give me cuddles and tell me how pretty I look. It was a tough year, but when I look in the mirror I know it was worth it.'
