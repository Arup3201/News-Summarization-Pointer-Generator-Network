A seven-year-old girl has shaved off all her beautiful red hair to show her support for young children suffering from cancer – including her little sister.

Hannah Gorsegner from Middletown, New Jersey, took the brave decision because she wanted to show her support for five-year-old sister, Natalie, who was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in August 2012 and is now in remission.

Hannah, who said the day her sister was diagnosed was ‘the worst day of her life’, announced her decision to shave her head during an appearance on the Today show last month.

Proud mom: Andrea Verdone Gorsegner congratulates her brave daughter after she has had all her hair shaved off

‘I'm going to shave my head,’ she said. ‘This is one of the ways I can help kids with cancer and inspire them to be brave.’

The shaving took place last Wednesday during a Shave For A Cure event held by the Arms Wide Open Childhood Cancer Foundation at the New York Stock Exchange.

The two sisters wore matching dresses to the event. 

As Hannah climbed up on a stool for her shaving, mom Andrea Verdone Gorsegner gave her a kiss and dad Dan Gorsegner stroked his daughter's long red hair one last time. 

Hannah's parents were emotional as they looked on while their daughter had been beautiful hair removed

Sister Natalie even got to join in and at one point used the clippers to shave her giggling sister’s head.

After Hannah’s head was completely shaved, she had glitter poured on over freshly bald head while the entire floor of the stock exchange  applauded.

She wasn't the only person to have her head saved that day and the others included several little boys and several businessmen who were supporting the cause.

The event raised over $350,000 for childhood cancer, and Hannah donated her red hair to wigs for kids.

‘I hope that someone's going to be wearing my hair and that they're going to feel happy about it.’ she told Today.

Proud father Dan Gorsegner had previously revealed that Hannah came up with idea to shave her head on her own, after watching Natalie lose her hair due to chemotherapy treatments.

'Andrea and I weren't very excited about it at first,' he said, describing the initial discussion he had with his wife.

'But Andrea and I talked a lot about it and when Hannah came up with the idea and she was very persistent about it, and obviously very passionate about it, it's obviously very difficult as a parent to say no to your kid when they feel so strongly about something.'

Hannah’s parents had been concerned about how their daughter might we treated at school, but they needn't have worried.

Their daughter was escorted to school by four businessmen from Merrill Lynch who had also had their heads shaved.

In fact Hannah received a round of applause from her classmates who came up to rub her head. Meanwhile the businessmen explained to the class that she was their hero after what she had done.

‘I don't want them to feel alone in this fight,’ she said. ‘I'm right by their side.’ 

Hannah's mom shares her daughter's generous spirit, and has already raised more than $136,000 for pediatric cancer research through her organization Infinite Love for Natalie Grace.

'Just witnessing what we've witnessed being in the childhood cancer community now, those kids alone are what keep you going,' Mrs Gorsegner said.

'And the fact that we are one of the fortunate families, that she is doing so well and had a good prognosis, I think that's why we do so much ... for those kids who do not and the families who can't do it themselves.'
