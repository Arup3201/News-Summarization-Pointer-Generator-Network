A cash-strapped Greek pensioner shot and killed himself in a public square outside parliament in Athens yesterday, after saying he refused to scrounge for food in the rubbish.

The death of the 77-year-old retired pharmacist, who said he wanted a ‘dignified end’, touched a nerve among ordinary Greeks.

One in five in Greece is jobless as the country grapples with its worst economic crisis since the Second World War.

Tributes: People lay flowers at the site where the pensioner fatally shot himself at Athens' main Syntagma square

Tributes: The financially-stricken pensioner had reportedly said, 'So I don't leave debts for my children' before shooting himself

After becoming desperate at his 
financial plight, the Greek pensioner is said to have put a handgun to 
his head in the busy central Athens square before declaring, 'So I won't
 leave debts for my children', and pulling the trigger.

Just hours after the death, an impromptu shrine with candles, flowers and hand-written notes protesting the crisis sprung up in the central Syntagma square where the suicide occurred. Dozens of bystanders gathered to pay their respects.   

One note nailed to a tree said 'Enough is enough', while another asked 'Who will be the next victim?'.     

The 'Indignant' protesters, who have turned out in the thousands against austerity measures imposed by foreign lenders in exchange for bailout loans, said they planned a march later on Wednesday.   

'This is a human tragedy,' government spokesman Pantelis Kapsis said as politicians in parliament decried the death.

Greek suicide rates increased in Greece by 22 per cent between 2009 and 2010, as the country struggled to cope with austerity measures

Acts of suicide have been instrumental in the past in provoking popular protest. A Tunisian vegetable seller triggered the start of the so-called 'Arab Spring' by setting himself on fire in December 2010.    

Witnesses said the man put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger after yelling out: 'I have debts, I can't stand this anymore.'

Another passerby told Greek television the man said 'I don't want to leave my debts to my children.'  

A suicide note found in his coat pocket blamed politicians and financial troubles for driving him to take his life, police said.   

The government had 'annihilated any hope for my survival and I could not get any justice. I cannot find any other form of struggle except a dignified end before I have to start scrounging for food from the trash",' the note said.   

Within hours of the man's suicide, dozens of heartfelt notes of condolence were attached to the tree near where he took his life in Athens

The president of the pharmacists' 
union in the broader Attica region, Costas Lourantos, said he recalled 
meeting the man several years ago and was struck by his dignified 
manner.   

'When dignified people like him are 
brought to this state, somebody must answer for it,' said Lourantos.

'There is a moral instigator to this crime - which is the government 
that has brought people to such despair.'    

Shortly after news of the man's 
death, Lourantos says he received an anonymous call from a pharmacist 
saying she would be next to follow suit.    

'I am now frantically looking to find out who it was so we can stop her,' Lourantos said.   

The busy square, through which 
thousands pass by during the morning commute hours when the suicide 
occurred, was cordoned off while the body was taken away.    

Greece is stumbling through its worst
 post-World War Two economic crisis as austerity measures demanded by 
foreign lenders in exchange for financial aid push the country into its 
fifth year of recession.   

Suicide rates in Greece have 
dramatically increased in the past three years as the country struggles 
to cope with economic hardship.

According to the Greek Ministry of Citizen Protection, suicides increased by 22.5 per cent to 622 in 2010.

The government last year said 
suicides had increased 40 percent over the previous two years as the 
worsening crisis drives ordinary Greeks to despair.

With financial hardship fast becoming
 an unavoidable facet of life for many, some Greeks said the 
pharmacist's public suicide would not be the last.   

'This is the point to which they've 
brought us. Do they really expect a pensioner to live on 300 euros?' asked 54-year old Maria Parashou, who rushed to the square to pay her 
respects after reading about the suicide.   

'They've cut our salaries, they've 
humiliated us. I have one daughter who is unemployed and my husband has 
lost half of his income, but I won't allow myself to lose hope.'
