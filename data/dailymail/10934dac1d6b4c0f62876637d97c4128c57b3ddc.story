A run-down shed filled with builder's junk has sold at auction for a staggering £38,000 - nearly four times its real value.

The identity of the buyer has not been made public, but auction house Hollis Morgan, who organised the deal, has admitted the woman who bought the dilapidated building in the St George area of Bristol, probably got swept away with the competitive nature of the bidding process.

Spokesman for the firm Oliver Hollis said: 'Literally it's nothing, it should never have sold for that amount.

Junk: It was full to bursting with building materials, including offcuts of wood and old tiles

'Essentially auctions bring out the competitive nature in everyone. If you can see someone is prepared to pay to pay a certain amount for something, you will as well.

'I think it is the only way we would ever have achieved that sort of money in that it was sold in an auction in a competitive market.

'The majority of interest before had been at about the £10-£15,000 mark. It's real value is about £10,000.'

The woman who has just forked out over the odds for the building does not even have any plans to redevelop it and make a profit. Mr Hollis said at the moment she only planned to use it for storage.

The dilapidated lean-to in Bristol 
was inherited by a young couple, who put the building on the market 
hoping it would fetch around £15,000.

The
Victorian brick outhouse is sandwiched in next to a terraced house in 
Ebenezer Street where the average family home is valued at just under 
£100,000.

It has no planning permission, but auction experts reckon it would make an ideal small business premises or workshop.

The auction was staged by Clifton-based Hollis Morgan as part of a sale day which saw a record-breaking £5million worth of property sold in just a few hours.

No fewer than 75 separate people had registered an interest in the shed before bidding got under way.

Mr Hollis explained up to nine people had combined to bring the value up to the £20,000 mark.

Then they gradually started to fall away and in the end three people were left competing head to head for the 20ft by 10ft plot of land, raising the stakes by about £2,000 each time, until it plateaued at the phenomenal £38,000.

Mr Hollis added: 'Everyone was looking around in excitement. There was a real buzz in the room.'

The couple who sold the property, who have not been named but are both 19, are said to be delighted with the amount of money they made on the deal, reportedly saying they were 'made for life'.

Experts claim the bumper sale is part
of a national upturn in a market filled with buyers who are ready to 
pounce when the right property becomes available.

Bristol
estate agent CJ Hole said: 'Month-on-month we have continued to see the
numbers of completions grow. We are seeing 10 per cent increases this 
year alone for certain properties.

'We are still seeing multiple and sealed bids. The sunshine has no doubt helped to boost the market.

'Parking
too is playing its part and the new residents' parking zones, certainly
in our experience, have been well received and anticipated.'
