There's nothing like a warning from the doctors to spur on a health kick.

At least, that's what worked for super-slimmer Steven Goodwin who lost 17 stone in just one year after doctors warned him he was just days from death.

Goodwin, 39, tipped the scales at 30 stone after years on a diet of takeaways and microwave ready meals - washed down with litres of full fat coke.

Steven from Carlton, Nottingham, got so large he could no longer bend over to tie his shoe laces and needed to use two walking sticks to stand up. He became a recluse, not leaving his home for a year and continuing to eat up to 4,000 calories a day.

But in October 2011 he was rushed to hospital after collapsing at home where he was diagnosed with pneumonia and severe diabetes.

Doctors at the Queen's Medical Centre (QMC) in Nottingham told him he was just days from death and must start losing weight immediately.

Incredibly, despite being offered a gastric band operation on the NHS Steven refused and began a diet of healthy food and exercise.

In just 13 months Steven shed a staggering 17 stones and slimmed down to a trim 12 stone 13lbs - shocking and impressing his doctors. 

He went from a size 54in waist to a slim 34in - losing more than half his body weight.

Steven, who is a carer to his father Raymond, 71, admitted he was shamed into losing weight when he heard paramedics talking about getting firefighters to lift him into an ambulance.

He said: 'I had lost the will to live. I'd given up on myself and even when I was told I could die, it didn't really bother me.

'I can't describe the shame I felt when the paramedics discussed getting the fire brigade to assist them'

'I can't describe the shame and embarrassment I felt when I heard the paramedics discussing getting the fire brigade to assist them in lifting me into an ambulance in October 2011, knowing it was all my doing' he said

'I was admitted to the QMC in October 2011 and I was very, very ill. I had pneumonia and severe diabetes. I was told I could have days to live.

'I know it sounds strange but at the time it didn't seem to bother me. It was only when I saw my parents' reactions that I knew I had to do something.

'That spurred me on to change my life.'

At
his heaviest, Steven weighed 30 stone and had a body-mass index of 57 -
compared to a healthy BMI of 34 for a man his age and height.

The carer, who is 6ft, had been housebound for more than a year - struggling to walk and climb the stairs without his walking sticks and A-frame.

He left hospital in December 2011 and joined his local Slimming World group in March last year after refusing the offer of a gastric band on the NHS.

Steven now goes to his local leisure centre four times a week and does running, rowing and weight lifting for an hour at a time.

Steven now eats lean meals and it's certainly paying off

He added: 'If it didn't go 'bing' I wasn't interested in eating it - food had to come from the microwave or a takeaway for me to want it.

'Slimming World is a life-changing process, not a faddy diet.

'Everyone supports you, no one judges you and everyone inspires you. It's like a big family

'I'm very active now. I go to the gym regularly and I walk as much as I possibly can. 

'I go for long walks around Colwick Park at the weekends.

'I'm also doing circuit training with Notts County's Motivate scheme which I really enjoy. I feel like a new man.

'Just the other day, after running into the Slimming World meeting to be weighed one of the members came up to me and said "I will never forget seeing you hobble into group on that first day with two walking sticks and just look at you now".'

Steven became so large he didn't leave home for a year and continued to eat up to 4,000 calories a day but now he is slimmer and happier than ever
