An Ohio man hatched a plot to kill a 
woman he was in a home-ownership dispute with, authorities say, by approaching 
an emergency room patient at the renowned hospital where he worked as a nurse 
with the question, "Ever killed anyone?"

No, the Cleveland Clinic patient replied, but I once shot a 
man.

That was good enough, authorities say, for nurse Andrew Martin, 
23, who allegedly tried to resolve the dispute by offering the patient $10,000 
to kill the woman, who was never hurt.

Martin, of the town of Bristolville about 50 miles east of 
Cleveland, has pleaded not guilty. His trial is scheduled to begin Feb. 7 in 
U.S. District Court in Cleveland. His attorney, Edward LaRue, said "there's much 
more to come" in the case.

Accused: Andrew Martin, 23, of Brisolville, Ohio is accused of offering $10,000 to a hitman to kill a woman to resolve a property dispute

According to a federal affidavit that reads like a combination 
of real-estate law and backroom conspiracy, Martin somehow hooked up with a man 
named David Simons, who had done occasional carpentry work for an elderly man, 
George Warehime. How Martin and Simons met wasn't detailed.

Warehime died Dec. 4, 2010, at age 83 after years of decline. 
Doctors said he showed evidence of Alzheimer's disease. The administrator of his 
estate, sister Joy Comey, put his house up for sale and lined up a buyer.

She was stunned to visit the home Nov. 21, 2011, and find 
Martin and another man, David Simons there. They claimed her brother had deeded the 
house to them nine months earlier without cost.

Getting the house could enrich the men. It is valued at 
$193,000 for tax purposes.

Comey said her brother never 
mentioned giving up his home, on a tree-lined boulevard in a desirable 
neighborhood in Lakewood, minutes from Cleveland. Comey lived near him in the 
area blocks from Lake Erie and visited him frequently to care for him.

Comey called police, and a year-long ownership fight began in 
probate court. A judge eventually sided with Comey and voided a backdated deed 
notarized under questionable circumstances.

Dispute: This is the home at the center of a court case where a 23-year-old stands accused of an alleged murder plot. Andrew Martin is accused of plotting to murder Joy Comey whose brother, he claims, left him the property

Comey argued that the two men took advantage of her brother, 
who was found in 2009 to have memory loss and dementia. He couldn't hear 
well.

Simons claimed the deed to the house showed up in his mail box 
without explanation. His attorney quit in the middle of the probate case, 
fearful that his client was involved in fraud, court records said.

Martin is accused of using a cellphone to discuss the plot, 
and because the cellular network crosses states lines, he is being charged in 
federal court, instead of state court, with the murder-for-hire scheme.

Irritated that 'this 70-year-old lady, she has been trying to 
mess up my life,' Martin approached an ER patient who 'looked like a big guy,' 
according to the federal affidavit.

'Ever hurt anyone?' Martin allegedly asked the man, whose name 
wasn't disclosed.

'Yes, no, maybe,' the ER patient responded cautiously.

Martin pressed ahead, according to the affidavit, asking, 'Ever killed anyone?'

Hired: Nurse Andrew Martin is accused of trying to hire a hit-man at the exclusive Cleveland Clinic to kill a woman in a property dispute. The man was a patient and allegedly tipped off the intended victim

'I shot someone in the leg once,' the patient responded.

Satisfied the man lived in a tough Cleveland neighborhood, 
Martin allegedly offered him $10,000 to kill Comey. Martin described her and her 
car and provided her address, prosecutors say.

When the patient tipped a police officer, Comey was alerted 
and went into hiding.

The threat caused her anguish, and 'she was deeply disturbed, 
as one would expect,' said her probate attorney, Franklin Hickman.

Calls to Comey's home went unanswered, and Hickman said he had 
advised her not to talk to reporters.

The Cleveland Clinic, a research hospital known for its 
nationally ranked heart care, suspended Martin without pay when he was arrested 
in November.

Martin was locked up without bail to await trial.

LaRue, his attorney, said a picture of a hard-working young 
man would emerge at Martin's trial.

'He's been remarkably productive,' he said. 'He's been working 
ever since the age of 15. He's 23 now and has attained a certain degree of 
business acumen in the world, as well as a nursing license.'

Simons could not be reached for comment. A bankruptcy court 
filing from last year showed he had debts of nearly $150,000; he wasn't charged 
in the alleged murder plot.

Last May, in the middle of the probate fight, Simons took out 
a $600,000 insurance policy on the house, according to the federal affidavit. 
Ten days later, an early morning fire later declared arson damaged the house, 
and the insurer rescinded the policy.

Local prosecutors declined to comment on any investigation 
involving suspected house fraud or arson.

There is little evidence of the fire at the spacious house, 
which remains boarded up and padlocked by the city.
