Tyson Fury says his father's release from prison next month will further inspire him to win the world title this year.

'Gypsy' John Fury, himself a former professional heavyweight, has been inside since being given an 11-year sentence back in February 2011 after gauging a man's eye out in a brawl.

Fury had been young Tyson's trainer but he has not watched his son fight live for almost five years – when he beat John McDermott for the vacant English title in 2010

Fury will be a short favourite against Hammer who has lost three of his 20 fights

The 26-year-old has come a long way since that night, now under the tutelage of John's brother and highly respected trainer Peter, and has worked his way into the mandatory position for Wladimir Klitschko's WBO title.

Fury's next test comes against Christian Hammer on February 28 at London's 02 Arena, after which he will pursue that shot at Klitschko or even a showdown with American knock-out artist Deontay Wilder, who is now the WBC belt holder.

It is unclear whether Fury senior, who has spent time at his son's gym while on day release, will be allowed to attend the Hammer clash due to the terms of his release, but he will be able to watch the fight as a free man for the first time since 2010.

Fury said: 'My father gets out on February 11.

'I'm not too sure if he will be allowed to come to the Christian Hammer fight. I don't know the rules and regulations of his release will be but it is something I'm not focusing on.

Fury is fighting for the first time since his emphatic win over Dereck Chisora last November

Fury dominated Chisora for 10 rounds of their rematch before the Londoner retired on his stool

'He is out in three weeks now so he will be coming down to the gym and helping out - doing whatever the governing bodies say - that's what he will have to do.

'It has been good having him around in the gym and stuff - it's my dad isn't it? We have a close relationship so it's always good and inspiring to have him about.'

February 28 will be Fury's first outing since he outclassed Dereck Chisora at the ExCeL Arena with a fine boxing display, much of which was spent in the southpaw stance before his opponent was retired at the end of the 10th round.

That bout came on November 29 and allowed him to spend some time out over Christmas before focusing on a huge 2015. But he has now returned to the 'brutal' schedule arranged by uncle Peter at their gym in Bolton, which they live above during camp.

The 26-year-old said: 'I had about five weeks off over Christmas and New Year and indulged in a lot of nice foods. I took advantage of what I had just done in the Chisora fight and appreciated being around my family and kids.

Fury is the mandatory challenger to world champion Wladimir Klitschko and hopes to fight him this year 

'You don't realise what you miss when you're away until you spend a lot of time with them. I'm now back in training camp and that was hard in the beginning because I was used to waking up and being with the kids and taking them to school.

'Being back in strict training camp with three sessions a day is a hard regime but work has got to be done and bills have got to be paid.

'I'm back in Bolton, living above the gym, five days a week up there and home for the weekend and then back to Bolton on Sunday night. It's a good scheduled routine for me.'

Fury added: 'In the past I've made very bold predictions but I'm starting to become very correct in what I say. So I am not going to predict something unless I truly believe it is going to happen.

'I believe it's my destiny from being born to become heavyweight champion of the world. After having one amateur fight I thought so.

Nothing has really changed. I don't aim low when I aim to achieve, it's all or nothing.'
