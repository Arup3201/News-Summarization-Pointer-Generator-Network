The richest woman in the world warned her fellow countrymen they are becoming too expensive to employ.

Mining tycoon Gina Rinehart said it is becoming too costly for multinational companies who could hire workers for two dollars a day in Africa.

The 58-year-old said in a video address yesterday that businesses are forced to look to other nations as the price for Australian labour is too high, something which was immediately criticised by Prime Minister Julia Gillard.

Speaking from the hart: Gina Rinehart served up some harsh critique of the Australian government in her ten-minute long video address to the Sydney Mining Club

In her ten-minute long video for the Sydney Mining Club, Gina Rinehart said Australia must become more competitive.

Ms Rinehart, head of resources giant 
Hancock Prospecting, blamed the government's mining and carbon taxes, 
red tape and high wages for the economy's 'sluggish' performance.

‘The evidence is unarguable, Australia is indeed becoming too expensive and too uncompetitive to
 do export-oriented business,’ she said.

‘Furthermore, Africans want to work, 
and its workers are willing to work for less than $2 per day. Such 
statistics make me worry for this country's future.’

Too expensive: Ms Rinehart said she was concerned about Australian jobs when African workers were available at a much cheaper cost

Gina Rinehart is not averse to 
controversial statements. As recently as last week, she hit the 
headlines when she told Australians to ‘spend less time drinking or 
smoking and socialising, and more time working’.

Retort: Australia's Prime Minister Julia Gillard hit back at Ms Rinehart's comments

Her comments on Wednesday drew immediate criticism from Prime Minister Julia Gillard.

‘It's not the Australian way to toss people $2, to toss them a gold coin, and then ask them to work for a day.

‘We support proper Australian wages and decent working conditions.’

Ms Rinehart also attacked the 
Australian government, accusing them of not being competitive enough on 
the international markets, and added: ‘If we competed at the Olympic 
Games as sluggishly as we compete economically there would be an 
outcry.’

Her outburst came a day after iron ore
 giant Fortescue announced it would defer planned developments.

Last month 
BHP Billiton shelved its multi-billion dollar expansion of 
the Olympic Dam copper and uranium mine.

Australian mining projects have faced 
headwinds from depressed conditions in Europe and the United States, 
softening growth in China and increased competition from other producers
 as well as falling commodity prices.

The price of iron ore, a crucial 
ingredient in steelmaking, has fallen dramatically in the past two 
months as the Chinese economy slows, while the price of coal, another 
major Australian export, has also dropped sharply.

Prime Minister Gillard insisted that Australia would continue to be competitive in mining.

'We're going to compete on our great 
mineral deposits, our application of technology and high skills to the 
task. We mine differently than in other countries,' she said.
