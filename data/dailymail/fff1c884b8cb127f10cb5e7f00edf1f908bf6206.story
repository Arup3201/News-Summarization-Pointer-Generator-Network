You can't afford a trip to the seaside in the hot summer weather - so you make your own swimming pool at home.

That's what these Russian teenagers did yesterday, creating a fully-functioning water park in the living room of their flat in the city of Oryol.

With temperatures reaching an uncomfortable 34C outside, the boys used only 'polyethylene film and tape' to transform their carpeted lounge into a swimming pool several feet deep.

Young and reckless: The Russian teenagers built a fully-functioning swimming pool in the living room of their flat in Moscow. Quite how they planned to remove the water out of the building remains unknown

Cooling off: With temperatures reaching an uncomfortable 36C outside, the unnamed boys used only 'polyethylene film and tape' to transform their carpeted lounge into a swimming pool several feet deep

Taking a dip: They are seeing swimming together, posing with their thumbs up and diving beneath the water, while a thin layer of film covers their furniture and radiators

The images of the boys went viral after being posted on various Russian-language social media websites last night.

They are seeing swimming together, posing with their thumbs up and diving beneath the water, while a thin layer of film covers their furniture and radiators.

As well as posts congratulating the boys' creative way of keeping cool in the summer heat, there were others who branded them 'idiots'.

'The water is about half a metre high, 
which means it is about half a ton for every square metre. I wonder if 
their neighbours will gather altogether to give them a good lesson?,' one said.

'I hope the electric plugs are way above the water level,' another added, while a third person said: 'I hope they cut their nails really well before going inside...what if they break the film.'

Feeling the strain: One person posting on Russian social media about the images said: 'The water is about half a metre high, which means it is about half a ton for every square metre'

Under water: It is not immediately clear if the boy's had permission from the property owner to build the makeshift swimming pool, but given the risk of serious damage, it seems highly unlikely

As well as the potential risk of the ultra-thin polyethylene film splitting or the floor giving way under the weight, another potential sticking point was how the boys are going to get rid of the water.

Such a large amount of liquid would normally require a pump to remove and it seems unlikely the teenagers would have ready access to such heavy-duty equipment.

It is not immediately clear if the boy's had permission from the property owner to build the makeshift swimming pool, but given the risk of serious damage, it seems highly unlikely.Â 

That may be reason why, despite being happy to pose for photographs, the boys have refused to reveal their names or the exact location of the flat.

Perhaps in an attempt to persuade their own children not to pull such a reckless move, one of the most popular responses to the images on Russian social media websites so far is the simple phrase: 'Please, no one else try this at home.'
