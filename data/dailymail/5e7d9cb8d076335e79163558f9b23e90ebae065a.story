As the debate continues to drag on about Wayne Rooney’s midfield role at Manchester United, one man could be forgiven for wondering just what he has done wrong.

Ander Herrera cost United £29million. Sir Alex Ferguson identified his potential, David Moyes did the donkey work to extricate the Basque star from his complex contract at Athletic Bilbao, and Louis van Gaal rubber-stamped his signing before officially taking over at Old Trafford last summer.

Herrera has made just six Premier League starts under the Dutchman, however, and none since playing against Stoke at the start of December.

The situation has mystified many United fans who hope that Herrera will be given a chance at Preston North End in the FA Cup fifth round on Monday night having done well in the competition so far this season.

The Spaniard scored with a wonder strike to break the deadlock at Yeovil in the fourth round – his only other start in the last two-and-a-half months – and then came off the bench to set up a goal for James Wilson in the fourth round replay against Cambridge United.

Yet he still seems to have some way to go to win the trust of Van Gaal and his coaching staff. There is a feeling around the club that he has not bought into the manager’s strict ‘philosophy’ quite as well as some of his teammates.

It appears as though Herrera is paying the price for his below-par performances against Leicester City in September, when United fell apart in a 5-3 defeat, and West Brom the following month when he was taken off at half-time.

Van Gaal has challenged Herrera to improve, warning that competition for places in his midfield diamond could limit his opportunities. Daley Blind and Angel Di Maria followed the Spaniard into Old Trafford last summer, Michael Carrick, Juan Mata and Adnan Januzaj were already in situ, and that was before the decision came to re-deploy Rooney.

‘I have to compare him with people like Rooney and Mata, for example, so that’s difficult,’ said Van Gaal earlier this month. ‘They are all at a high level, he has to improve.

‘He’s a great guy, a very great professional also, so that’s not the problem. His problem is he has to compete with high level players and Rooney is also the captain so he has a privilege.

With the arrival of Di Maria to join Juan Mata in the creative midfield role, Herrera has been sidelined

‘We are playing now with a No.10 and that’s Mata and Di Maria. That’s difficult to compete against, but he already knew that when he signed for Manchester United.

‘When you sign for a top club like he did he knows that he is had to fight but he is fighting.’

It’s only four months, however, since Herrera was deemed so important to United that he was hurried back from a rib injury and Van Gaal allowed him to play in a protective corset on that disappointing night at the Hawthorns when he was replaced by Marouane Fellaini for the second half.

Now, Herrera must warm the bench while Van Gaal claims he has to play Rooney in midfield because there are no better options. It is quite a snub, and the manager’s admission that he will look to sign a world-class midfielder in the summer to release the England striker back to the front line does little to ease concerns that his future at Old Trafford is increasingly uncertain.

Herrera, who has also been forced to protest his innocence after being caught up in a match-fixing scandal in Spain since his move to Manchester, must wonder if he is in danger of going the same way as Shinji Kagawa.

For the time being, a player who arrived in England with such great expectations last summer just has to be patient – and hope for a chance to play against Preston.
