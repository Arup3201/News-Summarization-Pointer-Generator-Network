Posing in an array of figure-hugging outfits alongside male models half her age, Carol Vorderman is the picture of confidence.

But the TV presenter, who is showcasing her latest collection for Isme in the photographs, has revealed that like every other women she has body hang-ups and would kill for the figure of someone half her age.

Speaking in an exclusive interview with MailOnline, the 52-year-old said: ‘I have a strange shape; I am like Ten Ton Tessie. I would love Abbey Crouch’s amazing figure, she is tall and slim and dresses brilliantly but I am never going to look like her.’

But Carol sure gives 27-year-old Abbey a run for her money in the modelling stakes in her latest campaign for clothing brand Isme, for whom she has been a style ambassador since February.

Speaking about the new AW13 range, she said: ‘It is glittery with plenty of satin and lace – perfect for the party season but less in-your-face.

‘The range has glamorous and casual pieces and beautiful coats.’

Carol was surrounded by male models in her latest shoot so it's no surprise she admitted posing for the snaps wasn't a chore.

Body idol: Carol says she loves Abbey Crouch's figure (R) but admits she will never look like her and instead focuses on emphasising the best parts of her body

She said: 'I really enjoyed this shoot. The boys were a laugh and it's nice for us all to seek a little bit of fun and glamour to lift our spirits.'

Carol, who cites her favourite designers as Victoria Beckham and Roland Mouret, says her ultimate wardrobe essential is high-waisted trousers.

‘Jeans with a low-slung bum are in fashion but they’re difficult to wear. You have to be tall, slim and toned and I’m none of those,’ she said.

Sharing her top tips for looking glamorous over the party season, she advises women to look at their strong points and emphasise them.

‘Your shape does change in your fifties but it is a great time to get back into fashion. It’s important to make the most of your best parts and wear colours that suit you; I’d never advise wearing a miniskirt for example.

‘When you’re in your twenties you have supermodels shoved in your face but when you’re 50, you are what you are and shouldn’t try and compete with your daughter,’ she said.

Carol describes her own style as ‘eclectic’ and explains: ‘I always get photographed when I am leaving a restaurant so I am wearing a particular style - usually a dress and heels.

‘But when I am home in Bristol I just throw on a leather jacket, jeans and ankle boots.’

Perks of the job: Carol said she enjoyed working with the male models on the new shoot

Carol maintains that she ‘does nothing’ to keep her figure in check.

She said: ‘I went on a zip wire recently where I had to be weighed – I had a fit.

‘I hadn’t weighed myself in 15 years and I looked at the scales and had put on 18 pounds. I thought “that can’t possibly be right!”

‘I will lose it by Christmas, I am going on a no alcohol detox,’ she said.

The clothes modelled by Carol are now on sale from isme.com with party dresses costing around £65.

Jon Owen, from isme.com, said they are proud of their latest collection and hope they will be the brand of choice for women choosing their outfit for a Christmas party.

He said: 'Our range of partywear is better than ever this year, with something to suit every style and budget.

‘We will make sure all our customers look and feel fantastic this festive season.'
