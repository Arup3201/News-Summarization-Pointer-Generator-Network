The lawyer tapped to investigate allegations of workplace misconduct within the Miami Dolphins organization that led to former offensive tackle Jonathan Martin's quitting the team has released his independent report on the allegations and found that at least three players - including shamed guard Richie Incognito - harassed not only Martin, but several other players on the team.

The investigation was conducted by attorney Ted Wells, who is the co-chair of the litigation department at the firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, and was retained by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell in November to look into the allegations of harassment - that in many cases was racially charged - against Incognito that Martin claims caused him to leave the team mid-season.

Wells' report indicates that he agrees with Martin's claim that the endless harassment is what caused him to leave the team, and that it wasn't just Incognito who was responsible for the abuse, but several members of the team.

'The report concludes that three starters on the Dolphins offensive line,
 Richie Incognito, John Jerry and Mike Pouncey, engaged in a pattern of 
harassment directed at not only Jonathan Martin, but also another young 
Dolphins offensive lineman and an assistant trainer,' Wells writes in his report.

The harassment of the trainer and others was often derogatory towards homosexuals and in many cases racist.

He goes on to write that 'the Report finds 
that the assistant trainer repeatedly was the object of racial slurs and
 other racially derogatory language; that the other offensive lineman 
was subjected to homophobic name-calling and improper physical touching;
 and that Martin was taunted on a persistent basis with sexually 
explicit remarks about his sister and his mother and at times ridiculed 
with racial insults and other offensive comments.'

The harassment of the trainer and others was often derogatory towards homosexuals and in many cases racist.

-April 23, 2013Martin writes his mother: 'I'm a push over, a people pleaser. I avoid confrontation whenever I can, I always want everyone to like me. I let people talk about me, say anything to my face, and I just take it, laugh it off, even when I know they are intentionally trying to disrespect me. I mostly blame the soft schools I went to, which fostered within me a feeling that I'm a huge p****, as I never got into fights. I used to get verbally bullied every day in middle school and high school, by kids that are half my size. I would never fight back, just get sad & feel like no one wanted to be my friend, when in fact I was just being socially awkward. Most people in that situation are witty & quick with sarcastic replies, I never have been. I'm awkward around people a lot of the time because I simply don't know how to act around them.'

-April 29, 2013, Martin writes his father: 'People call me a Nigger to my face. Happened 2 days ago. And I laughed it off. Because I am too nice of a person. They say terrible things about my sister. I don't do anything. I suppose it's white private school conditioning, turning the other cheek.'

-May 5, 2013, Martin writes his mother: 'I'm never gonna change. I got punked again today. Like a little b****. And I never do anything about it. I was sobbing in a rented yacht bathroom earlier.

-January, 2013, Martin writes his mother: 'I have really severe depression. There are many instances where I can't get out of bed. . . . I'm really embarrassed to talk about it with anyone in person, I tried to with you when I was home but I couldn't do it. I've managed to keep it under control for the most part on my own. Anyways, I really do wanna take care of it, because it is debilitating & keeps me from reaching my potential in all facets of life.'

-May 28, 2013: Martin writes his mother: 'I just don't really see the point in things. It's a major accomplishment for me if I brush my teeth or eat more than 1 meal in a day on off days. It's not that I'm sad, just unmotivated.'

Martin, a Stanford standout in his second season with the Dolphins, left the team in October citing 'emotional' reasons.

It was later revealed that Incognito and other players created a 'culture' of harassment in the Dolphins' locker room, and that Martin often was the target.

Incognito - considered one of the NFL's 'dirtiest' players - claimed his alleged harassment of Martin was all in good fun, and that Martin was exaggerating the claims of verbal abuse.

Wells' report, however, finds that Martin's claims are genuine - and that they were the primary reason he left the team.

'The Report rejects any suggestion that Martin manufactured claims of 
abuse after the fact to cover up an impetuous decision to leave the 
team. Contemporaneous text messages that Martin sent to his parents and 
others months before he left the Dolphins — which have never before been
 made public — corroborate his account that the persistent harassment by
 his teammates caused him significant emotional distress,' Wells writes in his report.

In many of the messages Martin wrote to his family he describes being depressed because people think he's 'soft,' or a 'pushover' who lets people walk all over him.

'I care about my legacy as a professional athlete. But I'm miserable currently. A therapist & medication won't help me gain the respect of my teammates. I really don't know what to do Mom,' Martin wrote to his mother in an email on April 2013.

However, Wells found that it was not the other players' intention to make Martin quit.

'Martin’s teammates did not intend to drive Martin from the team or cause him lasting emotional injury,' Wells writes.

Wells concludes that, 'in short, the 
treatment of Martin and others in the Miami Dolphins organization at 
times was offensive and unacceptable in any environment, including the 
world professional football players inhabit. A young football player who
 has the skills to play at the highest level, and who also happens to be
 quiet and reserved, should have the opportunity to pursue a career in 
the NFL without being subjected to harassment from his teammates.'

Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross issued a statement addressing Wells' report.

'We
 have just received the report from Ted Wells and will review it in 
detail before responding relative to the findings. When we asked the NFL
 to conduct this independent review, we felt it was important to take a 
step back and thoroughly research these serious allegations. As an 
organization, we are committed to a culture of team-first accountability
 and respect for one another,' Ross said in the statement.

Incognito also has responded to the report through his attorney, Marc Schamel.

'Mr. Wells' NFL report is replete with errors. The facts do not support a conclusion that Jonathan Martin's mental health, drug use, or on field performance issues were related to the treatment by his teammates,' Schamel says in a statement.

'It is disappointing that Mr. Wells would have gotten it so wrong, but not surprising.  The truth, as reported by the Dolphins players and as shown by the evidence, is that Jonathan Martin was never bullied by Richie Incognito or any member of the Dolphins Offensive line,' he continues. We are analyzing the entire report and will release a thorough analysis as soon as it is ready.'
