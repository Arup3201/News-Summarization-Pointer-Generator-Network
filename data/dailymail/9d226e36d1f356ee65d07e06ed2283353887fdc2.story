A Nebraska hospital has released security footage of the shocking moment its doors gave way during a flood and water came crashing through the cafeteria.

The video, which the Good Samaritan Hospital in Kearney posted on their Facebook page, shows staff and visitors standing on the staircase above the cafeteria as the water cascades through the doors and windows ripping through the room, smashing chairs and tables in its way.

Terrifying surveillance footage shows gallons of water bursting through the cafeteria doors at Kearney's Good Samaritan Hospital on Friday night.

The mighty rush of water violently explodes through a glass doorway and forces its way through the hospital, sending the workers running for their lives.

Employees first seen calmly surveying the soaked dining room floor before the deluge came barreling through the doors.

Tables, chairs and benches are swept away by the torrent.

According to local reports, Kearney’s sewer system was ‘overwhelmed’ by storms on Friday and Saturday, during which the town got almost four inches of rain.

The hospital, which uploaded the 33-second clip to its Facebook page, was hit by the flooding just minutes before midnight on Friday.

In a post accompanying the video, the hospital said that it was ‘hard to put into words’ how bad the conditions were.

‘To say we’re emotional about the whole situation is a bit of an understatement,’ read the post.

‘This security camera footage is just a glimpse into the series of events that unfolded Saturday.

‘Again, we’re so relieved no patients, staff or physicians were injured in this incident.’

By Tuesday, after working round-the-clock, a spokesman said all services for patients had been restored.

The town of Kearney received nearly 10 centimeters of rain over the weekend overwhelming the city's sewerage system.
