Football at Christmas always piles the pressure on managers. For two in particular there will be extra focus on what they do between now and the new year.

Ronald Koeman is going through his first truly tough spell as Southampton boss, while Steve Bruce has overseen Hull’s fall from FA Cup finalists to relegation strugglers. For Koeman, it has been an exceptional season until recently. For Bruce, things are in danger of sliding out of control.

In August nobody gave Southampton a chance. The club was gutted when the chief executive, manager, captain and star players all left. Many tipped them for a fight against the drop but I thought their squad was well equipped to cope, if not excel.

After a brilliant start to the season, Ronald Koeman's Southampton have lost their last five games

They have a good manager and a talented group of players. Their success has been surprising and that has generated a pressure of its own. When results are good, expectations rise. When they went 1-0 down to Aston Villa you could see the knives being sharpened but they recovered to snatch a draw.

There’s no shame in losing to Manchester City, Arsenal or Manchester United but the defeat at Burnley hurt. Follow that with a Capital One Cup exit at Sheffield United and suddenly cracks appear.

Koeman didn’t like the behaviour of the Blades’ bench and refused to shake Nigel Clough’s hand. He comes across as a calm, considered manager but he finally snapped. I’ve been dumped out of the cup at Bramall Lane and the place can feel like a bear pit. It’s a proper, old-fashioned ground and they did everything possible to make Southampton uncomfortable. It worked.

Steve Bruce's Hull City have only won one match out of their last 15 and are 19th in the Premier League

It’s no great surprise when teams from lower divisions try to disrupt opponents. I doubt Clough was involved — after all this is the son of a man who put a sign in front of raucous Nottingham Forest fans pleading: ‘Gentlemen, no swearing please. Brian.’

Koeman is very competitive and a top manager, so frustration at his side’s form and United’s gamesmanship finally brought him to the boil. It’s hard, too, for a manager who was once a great player — Koeman can’t go and smash in a free-kick himself if things aren’t going well.

It was a bad defeat and if Southampton are not careful it could be the one that derails their season. They face Everton on Saturday and are unlucky with the festive fixtures, with Chelsea and Arsenal back to back over the new year.

Saints have suffered two disappointing defeats in the last two matches to Burnley and Sheffield United

This is Koeman’s first real test and it will be fascinating to see how he deals with it — until a few weeks ago it was almost the perfect season.

I cannot say the same of Hull. After a fair start, Bruce’s side are in freefall. They have not won since the start of October and have taken only four points from 27.

Last season Bruce kept them up and took them to Wembley, an incredible achievement. That gave Hull the confidence to spend £40million in the summer, a huge amount for a club of their size. For the most part, those signings have not worked.

Hull City spent millions on Michael Dawson and Robert Snodgrass but both have fallen victim to injury

Robert Snodgrass cost £8m but was unlucky to dislocate his kneecap. At £10m Abel Hernandez was the club’s record buy but he has scored just three goals and Michael Dawson is the latest signing to suffer injury.

Bruce has a history of using the transfer market to save his team. In 2003 Christophe Dugarry helped him keep Birmingham in the Premier League and last January Nikica Jelavic and Shane Long boosted Hull. But after that £40m summer outlay, how many more times can he dig into the club’s pockets?

The tough times are when managers find out exactly what their players are made of. If Koeman’s struggles continue, his success will be seen as a flash in the pan.

If Bruce’s go on, he could well be fighting for his future.

At £10million, Abel Hernandez is Hull's record signing but he has only scored three goals so far
