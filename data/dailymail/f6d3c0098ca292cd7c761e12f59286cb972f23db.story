Zinedine Zidane has called for Thierry Henry to bid a final farewell to the France national team by playing in their friendly against Brazil in March.

Henry is now out of contract with MLS side New York Red Bulls, but claims he is yet to make a decision about his future.

Despite retiring from international football in 2010, French newspaper L'Equipe have started a campaign to get the striker back is Les Bleus for a final time next year.

French icon Zidane believes a final fling against 1998 World Cup final opponents Brazil would be the perfect way for Henry to say goodbye.

He said: 'For everything he (Henry) has brought to French football, it would be a great moment for him. And the opponents would bring him back some good memories.'

The Brazil friendly is due to take place at the Stade de France on March 26, which could mean Henry having to keep his fitness up between now and next year.

The 37-year-old is already being linked to a move back to Arsenal and Gunners boss Arsene Wenger believes the Emirates icon will return in the future.

Wenger said: 'Certainly one day he will come back here. In what role I don’t know, that is what he has to think about: what direction he wants to give to his next life.'
