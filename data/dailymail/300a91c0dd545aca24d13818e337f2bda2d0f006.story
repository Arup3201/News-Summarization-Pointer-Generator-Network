Twenty-eight News International employees are named in a notebook belonging to private detective Glenn Mulcaire, the phone hacking inquiry was told today.

The notebooks of the former investigator include references to the Sun and the Daily Mirror as well as for a series of News of the World journalists, the inquiry was told.

Robert Jay QC, counsel to the inquiry, said that senior executives had either failed to make the proper checks or they had condoned hacking. In either case there was 'room for a Nelsonian blind eye' towards the 'thriving cottage industry'.

Mr Jay said that Mulcaire wrote first names in the top left-hand corner of his notes recording details of the telephone voicemails he illegally intercepted.

Some of these corresponded to News of
the World employees, one of whom - referred to only as 'A' - apparently
made 1,453 separate requests for information from Mulcaire.

But the private detective also wrote 'The Sun' and a name relating to the Daily Mirror in his notebooks, the inquiry was told.

Mulcaire
was jailed with the News of the World’s former royal editor Clive 
Goodman in January 2007 after they admitted intercepting voicemail 
messages left on phones belonging to members of the royal household.

The
inquiry heard that the investigator’s notes relating to the royal aides
are marked 'Clive', 'private' and with the name of 'A', who cannot be 
named for fear of prejudicing the ongoing police investigation into 
phone hacking.

Robert Jay 
QC, counsel to the inquiry, said: 'One possible inference to be drawn 
is that ''A'' was working with or for Goodman, and he or she may have 
instructed Mulcaire to carry out an interception.

'It
might be argued that ''A'' could have been acting independently of 
Goodman, but that would not make much sense since Goodman was the royal 
editor.'

Mr Jay added: 'Either News International senior management knew what was going on at the time and therefore, at the very least, condoned this illegal activity.

'Or they didn't and News International's systems failed to the extent that there was failure in supervision, failure of oversight with possible failures of training and corporate ethos and checking of expenses claims.

'And there's room for a Nelsonian blind eye. In either version, we have clear evidence of a generic, systematic or cultural problem.

He added: 'I suggest that it would not be unfair to comment that it was at the very least a thriving cottage industry.'

Mulcaire also 
pleaded guilty to hacking the phones of publicist Max Clifford, football
agent Sky Andrew, chairman of the Professional Footballers Association 
Gordon Taylor, MP Simon Hughes and supermodel Elle Macpherson.

His notes for Mr Clifford feature the
name 'A' and 'private', for Mr Andrew a person referred to as 'I'; for 
Mr Taylor 'A'; for Mr Hughes 'A' and people named only as 'B' and 'C'; 
and for Ms Macpherson 'B' and 'private'.

In total about 28 legible corner 
names are legible in the 11,000 pages of notes that police seized from 
Mulcaire, which relate to a total of 2,266 taskings and the names of 
5,795 potential victims, the inquiry heard.

'A' requested information from the 
private investigator on 1,453 occasions, followed by 'B' on 303, 'C' on 
252, and someone identified as 'D' on 135.

Mr Jay said: 'We have a range of corner names. I know the names in each 
case, but obviously do not know anything about the corner name ‘private’
or its significance.

'We only have the first name in each 
of the cases, but they happen to tie up with the first names of 
employees of News International.'

The inquiry heard that actor Jude Law has brought a claim against the Sun for allegedly hacking his phone.

Mr Jay said: 'Part of the evidential 
matrix in support of his case is a corner name in the Mulcaire notebook 
which simply states ''the Sun'' without specifying the individual 
working there.'

The barrister added: 'There is also documentary evidence which we have seen of another corner name relating to the Mirror.'

Lord Justice Leveson this morning opened the inquiry into media standards that was set up after the News of the World phone hacking scandal.

He is examining the 'culture, practices and ethics of the press' and looking at whether media self-regulation works.

The
appeal court judge will hear evidence from phone hacking victims while 
considering whether self-regulation of the media works.

Lord Justice Leveson warned editors against targeting people who speak out against intrusion by journalists.

The Court
of Appeal judge was watched by Bob Dowler, the father of murdered 
schoolgirl Milly Dowler. Her phone was hacked by the News of the World.

Lord Justice Leveson said
his team would monitor newspaper coverage over the coming months for 
any evidence that witnesses to his hearings were being singled out for 
negative stories.

The chairman stressed that the freedom of the press was 'fundamental' to the UK's democracy and way of life.

He
also recognised that there was a 'great deal to applaud' in Britain's 
present press, adding: 'I certainly do not intend to limit my 
consideration to activities which could be the subject of criticism.'

But he stressed that he would be alert to any evidence of newspapers victimising witnesses who complained about press intrusion.

Lord
Justice Leveson said: 'Concern has specifically been expressed that 
those who speak out might be targeted adversely by the press as a 
result.

'I have absolutely 
no wish to stifle freedom of speech and expression, but I anticipate 
that monitoring will take place of press coverage over the months to 
come.

'And if it 
appears that those concerns are made out, without objective 
justification, it might be appropriate to draw the conclusion that these
vital rights are being abused, which itself would provide evidence of 
culture, practice and ethics which could be relevant to my ultimate 
recommendations.'

David Cameron set up the Leveson Inquiry in July after 
revelations that a private detective working for the News of the World 
hacked the phone of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler.

Lord Justice Leveson said the task of his investigation could be summed up in one simple question: 'Who guards the guardians?'

He said freedom of expression and freedom of the press must be exercised 'with the rights of others in mind'.

He said he had encouraged newspaper 
editors to meet and discuss these issues outside his hearings and put 
forward proposals for how the press could be better regulated.

'Those ideas must reflect the fundamental freedoms to which I have referred,' he said.

'But it must also recognise that 'guard the guardians' is not an optional add-on.

'Neither
is it good enough if it does not take account of the legitimate public 
concern, not only about phone hacking, but also other unethical 
behaviour not justified by what is truly in the public interest.'

The first part of the inquiry is looking at the culture, practices and ethics of the press in general.

The second part, examining the extent 
of unlawful activities by journalists, will not begin until detectives 
have completed their work and any prosecutions have concluded.

Milly's father Bob was among those who attended the start of the inquiry in Court 73 of the Royal Courts of Justice.

In an opening statement to Lord 
Justice Leveson and his panel, counsel to the inquiry Robert Jay QC, 
said the public probe was born of an 'extraordinary series of 
revelations' which resulted in the demise of the News of the World, 
along with high profile resignations at the top of the Met Police.

'The media trigger for the set up of 
this inquiry was the revelation that Milly Dowler's voicemail was hacked
into and deleted causing family and friends to cling to the hope that 
she might still be alive,' he said.

'Although the individual or 
individuals who deleted Milly's voicemail messages back in 2002 might 
not have realised at the time what the consequence might be in terms of 
raising false hopes, the public was ultimately sickened by the 
carelessness and cynicism of the perpetrators.'

Within two days of this revelation, 
the Prime Minister announced to parliament that an inquiry would be set 
up, Mr Jay told a room packed with lawyers, eminent QCs, media figures 
and journalists.

Mr Jay said the inquiry set out to expose the 'truth' and find 'practical and workable' answers.

But he added: 'These solutions will not 
necessarily have been the solutions which the press themselves would 
have devised but they will have to be workable in the real world both 
today and in the immediate future.

'Most particularly, the challenge is posed by the internet.The inquiry will also seek to identify where problems within the media might stem from, considering whether these may have been high up in organisations, exist because of a failure to stamp out bad practices or whether misdemeanours were systematic.'

But he added: 'Even if the inquiry was to conclude that a culture existed in a particular newspaper that would not mean that everyone else within that newspaper was inevitably tarnished by it.'
