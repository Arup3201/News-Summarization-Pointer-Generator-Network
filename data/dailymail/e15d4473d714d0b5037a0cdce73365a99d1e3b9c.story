Casey Kasem's wife will bury him in Norway and not Los Angeles as he wished, a publicist for the late radio star's daughter has confirmed.

Kasem's widow Jean Kasem has made arrangements for her husband's body to be flown to Oslo after claiming that she has Norwegian heritage.

But today in an embarrassing rebuttal for the statuesque blonde, Jean’s nephew spoke out to say his aunt doesn’t have ‘an ounce’ of Norwegian blood in her.

Tommy Thompson, the son of one of Jean’s siblings, said: ‘As far as we know, we are English, German and Native American.

Kerri Kasem, Casey Kasem's daughter,  wants her dad to be buried in Los Angeles

‘We have never ever heard anyone speak of Norway or [speak] Norwegian for that matter in our house. ‘We don''t have an ounce of Norwegian blood to our knowledge.’

Casey's family are now working with LA private investigator Logan Clarke but have few legal options to prevent the overseas burial, publicist Danny Deraney said.

Mr Deraney revealed that Casey’s daughter Kerri is planning on writing a letter to the Norwegian government expressing her dismay at the situation.

He said: ‘As you may have seen, Jean Kasem is planning to attempt to bury Casey Kasem in Oslo, Norway. She sent an open letter to the Norwegian government declaring among other things, her Norwegian ancestry.

‘The children, the family and friends want Casey Kasem to be buried in the place he requested, Forest Lawn in Glendale. Not to a foreign country he has never visited.’

Teruyuki Olsen, a lawyer for Jean Kasem, didn't return an email seeking comment.

As the spouse of the radio personality, Jean Kasem is conservator of his body, said Deraney,

They were married for 34 years.

It was unclear when the burial might occur.

Kasem, host of 'American Top 40', died on June 15 at a hospital in Gig Harbor, Washington. He was 82 and suffering from dementia.

His death followed a lengthy battle over his care between Jean Kasem and his three adult children from his first marriage.

Deraney said burial outside the United States would be contrary to what Casey Kasem had wanted.

'He publicly made it clear to his friends, his kids, that he wanted to be buried in Forest Lawn in Glendale, in Los Angeles,' the publicist said.

The Norwegian newspaper VG reported that Kasem will be buried in Oslo.

'It's been arranged, he's going to Oslo,' Wenche Madsen Eriksson, the head of the funeral service administration in Oslo, told the newspaper.

She declined to say why Oslo was chosen, explaining that the family wants to keep that information confidential.
