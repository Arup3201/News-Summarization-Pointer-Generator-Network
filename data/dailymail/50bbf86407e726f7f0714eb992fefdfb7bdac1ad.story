A 21-year-old man critically wounded his college honors student ex-girlfriend and killed her new boyfriend, then turned a gun on himself in a murder-suicide that has shocked the small-town campus of Salisbury University in Maryland.

Police say Ryan Shallue became increasingly disturbed after his high school girlfriend Kristen Loetz, 19, dumped him four months ago. She had just started her sophomore year of college. Shallue began stalking her and bought a gun two weeks ago.

On Wednesday night, he showed up at Loetz's off-campus house, where she discovered her with 20-year-old Charles 'CJ' Abbott. When Shallue began fighting with Loetz, Abbott tried to intervene, police said.

'Thanks for being my hero': Loetz wrote an emotional thanks to CJ Abbott, the 20-year-old who sacrificed himself to help save her life when ex Ryan Shallue pulled out a gun to exact his revenge

Shallue pulled out a semi-automatic pistol and shot Loetz in the face and killed Abbott. He then went into the bathroom and shot himself in the head. 

Abbott's sister said he died a hero, trying to stop Shallue from assaulting Loetz.

Loetz was taken to a Baltimore hospital, where she was listed in critical condition. Friends say it appears she will pull through, but will need facial reconstruction surgery.

The Salisbury Daily Times reports that Loetz and Shallue graduated high school together in Stevensville, Maryland, in 2010. The Facebook profiles for both Loetz and Shallue show dozens of photos of them embracing - appearing a happy couple at the beach and at prom.

After high school, Loetz left and attended Salisbury University, an hour and a half away. She became a promising nursing student whom teachers called bright and attentive. She joined a sorority on campus and worked at a community center for special needs children and teens.

Shallue stayed behind and appears to have done little with his life. His Twitter page shows a man becoming increasingly bitter and obsessed with alcohol.

Police say Loetz dumped Shallue four months ago and that he spiraled into obsession and anger.

The Daily Times reports that his Twitter page, now removed, includes tweets like 'I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive!' and 'I found the cure and its name is vodka!'

Abbott was a skilled car mechanic in Salisbury. His bosses described him as hard-working and dedicated.

His sister told the Daily Times that Abbott and Loetz had been seeing a lot of each other recently.

She said her entire family - including his twin brother - are devastated by the shocking murder, but said no one was surprised he died trying to protect a friend.

'It’s just like CJ to be a hero,' April Abbott told the newspaper.
