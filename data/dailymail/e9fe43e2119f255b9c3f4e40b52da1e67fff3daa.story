A security guard was burned to death when a massive fire engulfed a 15-storey office block in the heart of New Delhi's business district on Monday morning.

Jai Bhagwan, 52, died on the eighth floor of Himalaya House after the fire broke out on the third floor of the building and rapidly spread upwards, the Hindustan Times reported.

Thick plumbs of smoke poured from windows and flames were visible on a number of floors during the blaze, which was reportedly caused by an electrical fault at about 6.20am.

Inferno: A security guard died in this enormous blaze in Himalaya House, a 15-storey office tower in the heart of New Delhi, on Monday morning

Burned out: The fire was believed to have been caused by an electrical fault on the third floor and spread rapidly to higher levels

Intense heat: Firefighters dispatched 32 engines to tackle the blaze, which was still smouldering at around midday, six hours after it started

Two other guards were rescued from the building by firefighters, who had dispatched 32 engines to the scene to douse the blaze.

They were Shiv Kumar, who was rescued from the sixth floor, and Raj Kumar, who was rescued from the 11th floor.

However, Mr Bhagwan, who was sleeping when the fire broke out, wasn't able to escape in time.

'The body of a security guard was recovered from the building,' said AK Sharma, director of Delhi Fire services.

'He was apparently sleeping when the fire broke out and could not get out of the building. Two guards were rescued.'

Casualties would have been higher had the fire broke out later in the day, as the 50-metre high is home to a number of companies.

'There was a lot of smoke. The smoke blackened the sky,' Kamal, an eyewitness, said.

Big operation: Firefighters coordinate on the ground outside Himalaya House, which is home to a number of commercial companies

Risky: The Delhi Fire service said it was not known whether firefighting equipment inside the building was functional

Good view: Office workers in an adjacent building watch as the large fire burns out of control

Close quarters: The blaze was very near to other office blocks in New Delhi's business district
