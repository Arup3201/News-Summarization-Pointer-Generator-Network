Newcastle United legend, former England captain and national treasure Alan Shearer spent his illustrious football career terrorising the best defences in the Premier League - and it all started just earning a weekly wage of £25.

With a record-high 260 goals in the Premier League, the talismanic forward has left a lasting legacy in the north east and one that is unlikely to be bettered.  

In an exclusive interview with Match of the Day magazine, Shearer opens up about his first experiences in life on and off the football pitch.

MY FIRST ... Live game

Alan says: 'I remember everything – getting on the metro, getting in the ground, walking up to the top of the stadium and looking at the pitch! Getting squashed because it was standing in those days, then it all going ballistic when Kevin Keegan scored and Newcastle won – it was mad!'

Shearer saw Kevin Keegan score in his first ever match at St James' Park when he was a child

MY FIRST… Job

Alan says: 'I used to do a milk round with my uncle to earn five pound every Saturday. I' get up at three in the morning, do the round and then go back to sleep. With that five pound I thought I was rich!'

MY FIRST … Girlfriend

Alan says: 'Oh, there was loads. All the girls wanted to go out with me!'

MY FIRST … Pay packet

Alan says: 'It was when I was an apprentice at Southampton, I was on a YTS scheme and it was £25 a week, straight into my bank account!'

Shearer started his career at Southampton before moving to Blackburn and winning the Premier League

MY FIRST… Car

Alan says: 'It was an Escort 1300 L, registration number B993 XHT. It cost me £3,395. I thought I was rich. I thought I was a multimillionaire 'cos I could go out and buy it when I was just 17! I cleaned it every day. If I ever got mud on it I was devastated.'

Shearer's first ever car was the Ford Escort 1300 L which was similar to the car pictured above

MY FIRST … pre-match meal

Alan says: 'My first pre-match meal was fillet steak. I'd never had it before in my life and everyone else was having it, so I thought I'm going to have it too!'

The former Blackburn star revealed that a fillet steak was his first ever pre-match meal as a footballer

MY FIRST… hat-trick

Alan says: '1988. It was my debut for Southampton at 17 against Arsenal. And then I was in the next day cleaning the kit because I was still an apprentice. I didn't think that was a great idea at the time but looking back it made sure I didn't get carried away.'

A 17-year-old Shearer had a debut he'd never forget after scoring a hat-trick but was soon back washing kits

The Newcastle United legend also holds the record for the most Premier League hat-tricks (11)

MY FIRST… tournament as a pundit

Alan says: 'I started with the BBC in 2006 so the first tournament was the 2006 World Cup in Germany. It was nerve-wracking because I was out of my comfort zone.'

The Match of the Day pundit has become a regular on the show and at major tournaments like the World Cup
