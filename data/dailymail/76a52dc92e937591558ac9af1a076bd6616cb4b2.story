Republican congressman Randy Weber went after President Barack Obama on Twitter for his absence at the Paris solidarity march on Sunday and compared him to Hitler

A GOP congressman compared President Barack Obama to Hitler while criticizing the U.S. leader for neglecting to attend a solidarity march in France last weekend.

Texas Rep. Randy Weber tweeted: 'Even Adolph Hitler thought it more important than Obama to get to Paris. (For all the wrong reasons.) Obama couldn't do it for right reasons. 

Weber notably misspelled Hitler's first name, which was Adolf, not Adolph. 

A conservative congressman who was among a group of 25 Republicans last week who revolted against House Speaker John Boehner, Weber has excoriated Obama in the past over his plans to give 'amnesty' to millions of immigrants residing in the country illegally.

Ahead of last year's State of the Union address he used a Nazi-era term for military police to in a tweet attacking Obama and suggested that the Democratic president was purposefully misleading the American people.

'On floor of house waitin on "Kommandant-In-Chef"... the Socialistic dictator who's been feeding US a line or is it "A-Lying?"'

Weber first tried to justify his tweet invoking reviled German dictator Hitler in his verbal assault on Obama, telling the Dallas Morning News it was meant to 'start a discussion' about the president's foreign policies.

'Hitler reminds us that there’s evil in the world. Obama doesn’t seem to get it. This is about his foreign policy, his actions or lack thereof,' Weber said. 

But after the controversy over his tweet raged on, he apologized in full.

'It was not my intention to trivialize the Holocaust nor to compare the President to Adolf Hitler,' Weber said in a statement, this time spelling Hilter's first name correctly.

'The mention of Hitler was meant to represent the face of evil that still exists in the world today. I now realize that the use of Hitler invokes pain and emotional trauma for those affected by the atrocities of the Holocaust and victims of anti-Semitism and hate,' he professed.  

Prior to Weber's retraction, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had gone for the jugular over the matter, calling his tweet  'beyond vile and insulting.'

Twitter users also blasted him. 

'[W]hat the hell is wrong with you. Moron,' Jack Hutton said in a reply.

'So you're saying... Obama is worse than Hitler?' another user asked.

'I mean, geez. If you're going to the Reductio ad Hitlerum route at least spell "Adolf" correctly,' a user named Josh Terry lampooned.

New York Rep. Steve Israel, who is Jewish, said in a statement that the tweet was 'vile and stoops to a new low level by desecrating the victims of the Holocaust to make a political point.'

'At a time when we should be coming together in the wake of the attacks in Paris, Rep. Weber turned instead to hate. 

'While I, too, disagree with the President's absence in Paris, there is a proper way to express that disagreement, unlike Rep. Weber's tweet,' the Democrat said, chastizing Weber for having a 'complete lack of judgment.'

Hitler once visited France's capitol city in 1940 after it was under German control. During the brief trip he viewed the tomb of famed French emperor Napoleon and marveled at the city's architecture, drawing inspiration from Paris for the construction of public buildings in his own country's capitol, Berlin.

He also arranged for two WWI memorials, one honoring British nurse Edith Cavell, who was executed by a German firing squad for aiding Allied soldiers, and the other French General Charles Mangin, be destroyed, as they represented German defeat.

Obama last visited the Paris in June when he attended a service commemorating D-Day and the liberation of northern France from Hitler's forces.

Since the Sunday unity rally in Paris memorializing the victims of a terrorist attack on satirical publication Charlie Hebdo, Obama has been assailed by Republicans and the media for sitting out the major event, which attracted millions.

'The absence is symbolic of the lack of American leadership on the world stage, and it is dangerous. The attack on Paris, just like previous assaults on Israel and other allies, is an attack on our shared values,' Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a presumed candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, said Monday in an op-ed for Time.

'Our President should have been there, because we must never hesitate to stand with our allies. We should never hesitate to speak the truth. In Paris or anywhere else in the world,' Cruz wrote.

Attorney General Eric Holder was in Paris on another matter, but he did not march for undisclosed reasons. The U.S. ambassador to France, Jane Hartley, was the highest-ranking American to march.

The White House's failure to send a visible U.S. representation at the event that was attended by more than 40 other world leaders fueled a sparring match between 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and members of the press on Monday as reporter after reporter demanded that the president's spokesman explain the  goof up.

The West Wing's chief spokesman, Josh Earnest, acknowledged that the president's advisers made a mistake in not ordering a cabinet-level official to the march.

'I think it’s fair to say that we should have sent someone with a higher profile to be there,' he said.

Without directly blaming West Wing staff, Earnest confessed that Obama was not involved in the decision-making process. 

He also confirmed that both the president and vice president were resting at home over the weekend, though the Obama administration official adamantly denied that either U.S. leader could have marched in Paris  without their security detail 'significantly' impeding the experience of other marchers, which he said was a major concern of the White House.

Earnest said 'had the circumstances been a little bit different, I think the President himself would have liked to have had the opportunity,' pointing out that the White House was informed of the march just 36 hours before it was to take place.

The president's spokesman was won't to detail the White House discussions that precipitated the international incident.

'But I think suffice it to say there should not be, and there is not any doubt in the minds of the people in France or people around the world, and certainly not among our enemies, about how committed to a strong relationship that the United States is with France, and committed to the same kinds of values that they are,' he said.
