When it comes to packing for a long-haul journey, who better to take travel inspiration from than a globe-trotting celebrity? After all, they basically do it for a living.

From our favourite Victoria's Secret supermodel to the latest reality starlet du jour, they all love sharing their packing secrets, from A-list essentials like energy drinks and healthy snacks to those little luxurious touches.

While Rosie Huntington-Whiteley loved comfortable leggings and a cosy cashmere sweater, model Karlie Kloss swears by good reading materials for the flight and a pair of rose-gold Frends headphones.

America's supermodel darling - not to mention best friend to Taylor Swift - Karlie certainly knows a thing or two about work travel.

In one of her most recent Instagram posts, the 22-year-old Victoria's Secret Angel revealed every last item that went into her stylish carry on.

Among her must-haves: the latest issue of The Economist, Vanity Fair and The Wall Street Journal (clearly the model is well-read), as well as stylish Nike trainers and two smartphones: an iPhone and a Blackberry.

She also showed off a chic monogrammed passport wallet from Louis Vuitton and a sleek Canon digital camera.

Spice Girl-turned-fashion designer, Victoria Beckham, is often flying around the globe. Here, she reveals what she packed on her trip to China

Many of the clothes that Victoria packed for her Asia adventure were items from her namesake label. Pictured here landing at JFK Airport in New York City with daugher, Harper

From her days in the Spice Girls to her recent career as an in-demand fashion designer, Victoria Beckham tops the list when it comes to our airport (or any other time) style inspirations.

Unsurprisingly then, when Victoria took to Instagram to share her clothes to be packed for a trip to China - splayed out beautifully across the floor - she also took the opportunity to promote some of her namesake high-end label.

The two-toned pouches and contrasting collared shirts are particularly useful during a quick getaway, no matter where you are in the world. 

Karlie's fellow Victoria's Secret Angel, Candice Swanepoel has also taken to Instagram to share the contents of her carry-all

Candice and fellow supermodel, Joan Smalls, recently headed to London from New York City for the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show

'Forever packing suitcases,' Victoria's Secret Angel, Candice Swanepoel, captioned her #TravelinStyle Instagram snap. And as one of the top earning models in the world, we're not surprised.

Among her most coveted posessions is a personalised black Schutz bag, as well as a collection of trainers and even a baseball cap for a casual off-duty look.

And sticking true to her fashion-forward roots, the 26-year-old supermodel was also sure to add some Rag & Bone to her suitcase. 

Kim's purse essentials include Cosmopolitan, a Blackberry and iPhone, LaMer moisturiser, a snack bar and, of course, stylish sunnies

Proud sis! Reality star Kim Kardashian used a snap of her in-transit essentials as a way to show off her little sister's Cosmopolitan cover

Whether travelling with husband Kanye West or fulfilling her own media commitments around the globe, it seems like Kim Kardashian spends most of her life in transit.

Before an early call-time, Kim took to Instagram to share her purse essentials, which would undoubtedly all come in useful during a long-haul flight.

Among her must-haves was her little sister Kylie Jenner's most recent accomplishment: a Cosmopolitan cover.

Kim also packed a coconut snack bar, Hype energy drink, rosewater (because she's 'obsessed with the scent'), as well as a travel-sized version of LaMer's signature moisturiser.

Like Karlie, Kim also opted for both a Blackberry and an iPhone and her trademark accessory: a pair of stylish sunglasses. 

If you've ever wondered what is inside Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's luggage, the model has taken to social media to reveal all...

From day to night: Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is always the epitome of travel style perfection, seen here at LAX

As Who What Wear's latest monthly contributor, Rosie Huntington- Whiteley isn't shy when it comes to sharing her style tips.

For her first column, the British supermodel and actress revealed all of her airport and travel must-haves, which include everything from a pair of statement Alaia boots to Lena Dunham's best-selling book, Not That Kind Of Girl. 

'Travelling is a big part of my job,' she told Who What Wear. 'Over the years, I've learned the importance of an unfussy airport outfit.'

'Long hauls call for pieces that keep you cosy on the plane, but also make you feel good upon arrival.' 

During a recent trip to London, Rosie filled her suitcase with a cashmere sweater from Acne, a Saint Laurent bag and scarf, Balenciaga leather pants and weekend bag, a casual Paige t-shirt, a Eugenia Kim hat, Miu Miu sunglasses and a coat by The Row.

When it comes to serious airport style, model Kendall opts for a matching set of (extremely expensive) Louis Vuitton luggage

Nineteen year old Kendall Jenner has clearly learned a thing or two about packing from her jet-setting older sister, Kim Kardashian

When it comes to travelling in style, it's clearly an instance of younger sisters learning from their older siblings.

Model of the moment, Kendall Jenner, posted an impressive collection of Louis Vuitton luggage to the social networking site, along with an emoji of a plane - no doubt inspired by big sister Kim's stylish airport ensembles.

Louis Vuitton's Zephyr range starts at £2,140, while the brand's similar rolling Pegase model starts at £1,950.
