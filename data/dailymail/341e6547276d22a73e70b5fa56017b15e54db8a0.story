Would-be presidential assassin John Hinckley Jnr has engaged in 'risky' relationships with married and psychotic women and may still pose a risk to society, according to a psychiatrist who is an expert in risk assessment for assassins.

Hearings to determine whether Hinckley should be allowed more free time outside of St Elizabeth's Hospital to visit his elderly mother in Williamsburg, Virginia, is entering its tenth day today.

The 56-year-old tried to kill President Ronald Reagan in March 1981 outside a Washington hotel to try and impress actress Jodie Foster. He was found not guilty by reason of insanity and has been in mental hospital ever since.

Yesterday, Dr Robert Phillips testified that he is 
opposed to Hinckley being given more free time from the hospital he has been treated in the last three decades, citing concerns about the risks his 
relationships with women may cause.

Dr Robert Phillips said that in the 'real relationships' he has formed with women, he has not always shown good judgement.

As well as getting involved with a 'psychotic' patient from the mental hospital - whom he allegedly became physically affectionate with - he tried to begin a relationship with an employee at Eastern State Hospital, a mental facility Hinckley works a few hours a 
week when he's in Williamsburg.

The woman was married with children.

Dr Phillips said his efforts to attract the married woman were 'either fantasy or abject narcissism'.

Hinckley has been diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder. He was also diagnosed as suffering from major depressive and psychotic disorders, but doctors say these are now in remission.

Dr Phillips, who is also a medical doctor, is an expert in risk assessment for assassins.

The presidential assailant is currently allowed to leave St Elizabeth's Hospital for ten days each month to visit his visiting his mother in a gated community in Williamsburg, Virginia.

The hearing is to determine whether the visits can be increased. The latest proposal would allow for two 17-day releases followed by six 24-day releases.

Federal prosecutors oppose expanding Hinckley's visits, saying he remains a danger to society.

Hinckley shot President Reagan, press 
secretary James Brady, Secret Service Agent Timothy McCarthy and police 
officer Thomas Delahanty in 1981.

All of the men survived the assassination attempt but Brady was left permanently disabled.

Reports from the U.S. Secret Service surveillance of Hinckley said he would often visit bookstores when he went to Williamsburg and focused on books about Reagan and assassinations.

Though he did not buy the books or even open then, Dr Phillips said this activity indicated a risk factor.

He said: 'His target is on this shelf.'

Hinckley's defense lawyer argued the shelves at the store he was found to be staring at also contained other books and that he never actually picked any up or bought them but instead bought music books.

However the court also heard that he looked at a classical music CD entitled The Dead Kennedys.

Dr Phillips, who spent five hours interviewing the would-be assassin last year, will continue testifying today.
