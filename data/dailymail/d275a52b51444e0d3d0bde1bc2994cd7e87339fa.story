An aide to the Turkish prime minister who became internationally notorious when he kicked a mourning protester has been sacked over the controversy.

Yusuf Yerkel was filmed earlier this month attacking a man during a demonstration about the Soma mining disaster in which more than 300 people died.

He subsequently went on sick leave after claiming he had injured his leg in the incident - but now prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has sacked him as his deputy chief of staff.

Anger: Mr Yerkel became a symbol of the government's mishandling of the tragedy in which 300 people died

The mining accident has prompted national protests against the government, accused by mourning relatives of mishandling the aftermath.

Mr Yerkel became a symbol of the regime's alleged disdain for the victims when photographs emerged of him lashing out at the man, who was being restrained by two security officers.

In an apparent bid to quell the outrage, Mr Erdogan fired him from his post earlier this week.

'Yusuf Yerkel apologised but it was too late,' a government spokesman said. 'At the end of the discussion the Prime Minister fired him directly.'

The former aide is now due to be re-assigned to a different government job, according to a Turkish news agency.

Mr Yerkel took sick leave soon after the incident first came to light, saying he had injured his leg by attacking the protester.

Although he later apologised for his actions, he insisted that the mourner had provoked him.

'I am sorry as I was not able to keep my calm in the face of all provocations, insults and attacks I was subjected to,' he said.

Mr Erdogan, who faced mass protests in Istanbul last year, has been the subject for virulent criticism for his response to the Soma disaster.

However, he is still likely to become Turkey's first ever elected president later this year.
