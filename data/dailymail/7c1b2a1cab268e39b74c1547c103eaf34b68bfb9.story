Just hours after his top secret summit with the next Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal in Holland, Ryan Giggs was back at Old Trafford to cast his eye over the club's next generation of talent.

United's Class of '14 were in action against Chelsea in the final of the Under-21 Premier League, but Giggs's long day ended in disappointment as they went down 2-1.

So what should Giggs report back to Van Gaal? Which young stars should he bring through into the first team fold and which need a little more time to develop?

Ben Amos (Goalkeeper)

Aged 24, Amos was one of the permitted over-age players on show at Old Trafford and is already an understudy to David De Gea and Anders Lindegaard in the first team squad.

He pulled off an outstanding save early on to push away a rasping shot from Chelsea's Lewis Baker but his positioning could have been better when Charly Musonda flashed in the equaliser on 22 minutes.

De Gea isn't likely to be going anywhere soon and is actually younger than Amos. Needs to head off on loan again next season, like he did at Carlisle United in the first half of this campaign, otherwise he's going to be starved of match time.

Guillermo Varela (Defender)

An enterprising performance at right-back from the Uruguayan, who isn't shy in getting forward in support of the attack as is expected at United.

Gave Adam Nditi all kinds of problems with his twisting runs and trickery during the first-half and was then pushed further forward.

Deserves to be elevated to the first-team squad though and can provide competition for Rafael as his game becomes more mature.

Patrick McNair (Defender)

The centre-back only graduated to the Under-21 team during the latter part of the season and so isn't fully established at this standard.

Like his fellow defenders, was a little stand-offish when Chelsea attacked with pace and perhaps could have done better in closing down Musonda and Baker for the two goals.

Showed attacking credentials when nearly winning a penalty just before the interval. Will improve with another year at Under-21 level.

Michael Keane (Defender)

An England Under-21 regular and fairly experienced after loan spells in the Championship with Leicester, Derby and Blackburn, it's a big year ahead for Keane.

With the departures of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic leaving a vacuum at the heart of United's defence, a few solid performances could propel him into the first team on a regular basis.

Not the finished article, but there is a case for giving the 21-year-old an opportunity to prove himself.

Reece James (Defender)

Like Varela, showed a willingness to push forward on the left-side but also found himself pinned further back after half-time when United needed impetus.

His loan spell at Carlisle early this season was blighted by a thigh injury, though he recovered to become an Under-21 regular after Christmas.

Likely to be sent out on loan for experience again when the new season comes round. Replaced by Tyler Blackett after tiring late on.

Saidy Janko (Midfield)

Probably United's greatest threat in the second half, Janko was prepared to run at the Chelsea defence and covered plenty of ground up and down the right touchline.

At just 18, he has time on his side and will inevitably feature in more Under-21 matches for United next season. Giggs and van Gaal will keep an eye on his progress. 

Willing: Saidy Janko covered plenty of ground on the right flank as he tried to inspire United in attack

Charni Ekangamene (Midfield)

The Belgian was up against two very talented Chelsea midfielders in Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Lewis Baker but wasn't fazed and showed a willingness to get stuck in.

This was best demonstrated when he clattered Nathan Ake and earned a booking just before half-time.

His season in the Under-21s was also punctuated by a spell at Carlisle, though he only got on the field four times. Another spell in the Football League seems likely next season.

Ben Pearson (Midfield)

Oldham-born midfielder who has drawn inevitable comparisons with Paul Scholes. Featured heavily for the Under-21s and in the UEFA Youth League this season and put in a decent shift against Chelsea.

Will continue with the Under-21s for another season and could be worth a look in the League Cup.

Andreas Pereira (Midfield)

It was a disappointing night for Pereira as he struggled to inspire the United attack. He would have hoped to create a continuous stream of chances but openings proved few and far between, especially in the second-half.

He is tipped for big things and is clearly capable, but he won't be stepping up to the first team anytime soon.

Another year of experience for the 18-year-old in the youth competitions will increase his influence on games.

Quiet night: Andreas Pereira was unable to provide forward thrust for United

Tom Lawrence (Forward)

United's stand-out player in the first-half, especially with a nicely-taken goal early on, but lost his cutting edge after the break when often forced to take the Chelsea defence all by himself.

When Lawrence turned his man to curl home United's goal on 12 minutes and when he marauded down the wing early on, you could have closed your eyes and imagined it was a young Ryan Giggs with the No 11 shirt on.

Giggs would have been impressed watching on in the stands and will be willing to give him first team opportunities next season.

Lawrence sadly wasn't able to maintain his performance after half-time and lost two one-on-one battles with the quick Ola Aina when he could have been clear.

Was ultimately replaced by Josh Harrop and appeared to be carrying a knock. Did enough to impress though.

On target: Tom Lawrence capped a good display with the opening goal, a well-taken curling effort

James Wilson (Forward)

The 18-year-old lived out many a United fan's dream when he scored twice on debut against Hull City last week, but he was off the pace for the most part here as he struggled along while clearly carrying a hamstring injury.

He showed good awareness to set up Lawrence for the goal but otherwise couldn't carve out any chances. In the end, he limped off for the lively James Weir with a quarter of the match left.

Wilson will be in and around the first team next season having shown his potential already and could make an effective impact sub for Giggs and Van Gaal.
