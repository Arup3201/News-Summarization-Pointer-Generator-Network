This nifty new gadget is set to be a hit this summer - because it makes ice cream from scratch in just three minutes.

The clever Shake and Make device, £14.99, uses simple technology invented by the Victorians that uses salt and ice to create an exothermic  reaction, which in turn makes ice crystals form.

The user just puts salt and ice in the base unit then pours their own ice cream mixture in and gives the whole lot a shake.

The nifty gadget is perfect for camping trips and outdoor occasions

After three minutes the gadget will have made enough ice cream for a single serving.

Its inventors say the clever contraption allows ice cream fans to make their favourite treat on the go, and also means they can control the amount of sugar and preservatives in it. 

The device is now on sale at kitchen gadget shop Hinton's Home. 

Richard Smart, from Hinton's Home, said: 'The Shake and Make is a bit of a clever look back to a Victorian idea of frozen ice cream making before the days of electric freezers and machines.  

'It goes to show that sometimes the old fashioned ideas are the best.

'Very simply, you put ice and salt into the base unit and then place the mixing compartment on top, click the lid down and shake.

Old fashioned ideas are the best: The Shake and Make is aimed at children and adults 

Ice-cream in minutes: There are only four simple steps to making ice-cream with the device

Users put ice and salt into the base unit and then place the mixing compartment on top, click the lid down and shake for three minutes to get creamy and delicious ice-cream 

'The ice and salt create an exothermic reaction and starts to chill the mixture forming ice crystals and subsequently ice cream. 

'It can be used for regular ice cream or for frozen yoghurt. The taste is up to the end user, depending on what they decide to put into their mix.

'The ice cream is a bit firmer and less processed tasting than shop bought ice cream, and you also have the added benefit of not having an endless supply of E numbers added if you simply use natural flavourings and cream.

'The Shake and Make is aimed at children and adults alike. It's a bit of fun and creates just enough ice cream for one serving.

'I guess it's for that moment you think 'I really want a frozen treat but haven't got any in the house!' or if your camping and want to shake up a bit of a post campfire pudding.
