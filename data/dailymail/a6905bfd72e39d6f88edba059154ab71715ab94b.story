It is tempting whilst on holiday to let your hair down and enjoy the freedom of being away from home. 

Some holidaymakers take that freedom a little too far or fail to do their homework on local customs or laws, leading to calls for tourists to preserve some of their modesty and put on another layer or two.

From a bikini ban in Spain to a law that requires knees to be covered whilst shopping in Dubai, MailOnline Travel has compiled some of the clothing bans from around the world which have led to embarrassing incidents or fines for visitors.

Underboob photos have been posted by celebrities such as Rihanna and Suki Waterhouse to their many fans

Underboob selfies in Thailand 

It was revealed this month that Thailand would be banning women from taking underboob selfies to avoid the 'obscene' material causing 'public panic'.

Despite the act of photographing the lower part of the breast becoming a popular trend in the south-east Asian country, snappers could face five years in prison.

The military has been criticised for its extreme censorship of film, TV and music, while allowing some of its  infamous raunchy night activities to continue.

Qatar reminded tourists about appropriate dress last year and confirmed that leggings are not considered trousers in the country 

Lose the leggings in Qatar

Last year Qatar issued a decree advising tourists that leggings are not considered trousers and are not modest enough to wear in public.

Leggings have been singled out in pamphlets distributed by the Gulf state as inappropriate attire for tourists in the notoriously strict Islamic country.

The Reflect Your Respect campaign, launched by the Qatar Islamic Cultural Center, has listed some advice and tips for tourists on how to dress modestly in preparation for the 2022 Football World Cup it is hosting.

The pamphlets asked visitors to help preserve Qatar's culture and values. They state: 'If you are in Qatar, you are one of us. Please dress modestly in public places.'

It then adds: 'Leggings are not pants.'

The campaign uses social media to help get its message across, including the use of its own Twitter account.

Cover up or pay up! Beware if you are in Spain and fancying strolling off the beach in a bikini and heading into town, as you could face large fines 

Shelve the swimsuits in Spain  

Holidaymakers who feel the need to wander off the beach and into the town in their bikinis and speedos should think again in Spain.

In 2011 Barcelona announced that tourists who wander the streets in their swimming costumes, or less, could face fines. 

Mallorca followed suit with this last year and said penalties of up to £500 could be dished out for wearing swimming costumes in the street.

Aimed at both tourists and citizens, the laws are part of Palma City Council's 'Good Citizen Plan' which is known in Spain as the 'Ordenanza Civica.' 

Cover up in the Vatican

Fed up with tourists walking around the Holy See in skimpy outfits, instructions were issued in 2010 to cover up, particularly when entering St Peter's Basilica.

However, reports emerged of the Swiss Guards - the Pope's private army - implementing the rules across the city state.

Men in shorts and women who had not covered their shoulders were reportedly pulled aside in the July heat to be informed they were not dressed appropriately.

In order to enter the Vatican they were forced to buy shawls and trousers form nearby shops to ensure they were modestly dressed enough to pass inspection. 

Security cracked down on underdressed women at a shopping mall in Dubai by handing out guidelines

Cover your shoulders and knees in Dubai 

If you want to take advantage of the shopping mall whilst on holiday in Dubai, you may want to cover your shoulders and knees, or face being handed an advice card. 

Security at the Dubai Marina Mall in 2013 gave out blue cards to remind customers to wear 'respectful clothing' and outline what items were considered acceptable clothing and what are not.

Many people who received cards said they felt humiliated and that the action was unfair.  

According to a 16-page style guide laid out by Ascot, hats should be worn and strapless dresses are banned 

Don't bare your shoulders at Ascot

Seeing the fashion choices of ladies at Ascot has almost become as popular as the event itself. 

Some women push the boundaries of what can be worn to the traditional racing event, leading to 'fashion police' being installed at the entrances and turnstiles to vet outfits. 

According to the 16-page style guide laid out by Ascot, hats should always be worn, and strapless, halterneck and spaghetti-strap dresses are strictly prohibited.

Thailand's prime minister apologised for comments he made about bikinis after the deaths of two tourists 

Bikinis in Thailand

The prime minister of Thailand caused worldwide condemnation when he appeared to question whether female travellers who wear bikinis could be safe in the country.

Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha appeared to suggest that 'beautiful' women in bikinis could not be safe in the country, following the murders of British tourists David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, in Koh Tao last September.

In a broadcast, he was quoted by AFP as saying: 'There are always problems with tourist safety. They think our country is beautiful and is safe so they can do whatever they want, they can wear bikinis and walk everywhere.'

He added: 'Can they be safe in bikinis... unless they are not beautiful?'

Following worldwide outcry, the Prime Minister apologised for his comments, saying: 'I'm sorry that it hurt people'.
