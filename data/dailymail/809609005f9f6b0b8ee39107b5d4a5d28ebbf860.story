One person has died and three others have become ill after contracting the so-called 'flesh-eating' bacteria the Gulf of Mexico in Louisiana.

The person who died was an 83-year-old Terrebonne Parish man, who was infected when an open wound on his body came into contact with sea water while he was fishing in a boat.

Vibrio vulnificus is a naturally-occurring bacteria in warm sea water that belongs to the same family of bacterium as cholera and requires salt to live.

Southern waters: Water is routinely tested in Grand Isle and other areas in Louisiana to ensure safety for swimmers

According to the Center for Disease Control the bacteria can also be contracted from eating contaminated raw seafood.

The effects of the bacteria can be deadly.

When open wounds on otherwise healthy people are exposed to warm seawater containing the bacteria, the skin can become infected, leading to a breakdown and ulceration of the skin. 

Immunocompromised people face a deadlier risk: they have a higher possibility of the bacteria invading the bloodstream, leading to potentially fatal complications.

Contamination: Raw seafood, especially oysters, is a source of Vibrio Vulnificus

If the bacteria is ingested, healthy people can experience vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain.

For people with weaker immune systems, consuming Vibrio vulnificus can infect the bloodstream, leading to 'a severe and life-threatening illness characterized by fever and chills, decreased blood pressure (septic shock), and blistering skin lesions,' according to the CDC.

Bloodstream infections by the bacteria are fatal about 50 per cent of the time.

Patients are treated with antibiotics, and according to the CDC, infected wounds must be treated aggressively - sometimes meaning amputation of an infected limb.

High bacteria area: The warm waters around the Louisiana Gulf are prime areas for Vibrio Vulcanificus

Safety: Most swimmers are not at risk from the bacteria if they exercise precaution and avoid warm, brackish waters where the bacteria thrives

The four cases this summer have prompted the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals to warn residents to be careful about swimming with open wounds or infections, and avoid certain areas around the Gulf.

'We know people are venturing into our state’s waterways to cool off this summer, so we advise them to be careful and exercise health precautions,' Department of Health and Hospitals Secretary Kathy Kliebert said in a news release.

According to The Town Talk, Louisiana routinely tests its beaches' water, and posts advisories on 25 Louisiana beaches if the bacteria levels become high.

These recommendations are particularly important for those with compromised immune systems:
