The father of the child who was ripped from her murdered mother’s womb and then kidnapped has today broken his five-year his silence after the killer was convicted of the grisly crime that shocked a nation.

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, Roberto Rodriguez, 29, whose estranged partner, Darlene Haynes was eight months pregnant when she was horrifically murdered, revealed that he hasn't told the four-year-old about her mother and fears she might blame herself.

Mr Rodriguez said: ‘My daughter doesn’t know what happened to her mother. 
She’s too young to understand right now. If I told her how she had been 
born what would she think?

Killer: Julie Corey, 39, pictured today, was sentenced to life for the brutal murder of her friend Darlene, then 23, whose body was found on 27 July 2009 stashed in a small closet of the Worcester, Massachusetts home the friends had shared

‘She might blame herself. She might think that it was her fault her mother died.’

Rodriguez, who was accused of assaulting Darlene in the weeks before the murder went on to defend himself after he was accused in court of taking part in the gruesome crime and was questioned twice by detectives.

He said: ‘We’ve waited five years for this, five years for justice. I’ve 
had my name dragged through the mud.

'I’ll always be known as some 
scumbag but I don’t care now, I don’t care about my name I’m just happy 
this is over and that the person who did this has got what they 
deserve.'

Julie Corey, 39, was convicted of the brutal murder of her friend Darlene, then 23, whose body was found on 27 July 2009 stashed in a small closet of the Worcester, Massachusetts home the friends had shared.

She was sentenced to life in prison today while Haynes's father sat in court holding his daughter's ashes and her other daughter, now aged nine, read a heartbreaking statement to the court.

Haynes had been beaten around the head and strangled with an electric cord from a lamp. Corey, who had herself miscarried three months earlier, then cut the unborn child from her friend’s womb.

District Attorney Joseph Early Jr described the case as ‘the most horrific case this office has ever seen in terms of facts.’ Haynes, he said, was ‘killed for her baby.’

Corey tried to pass the child off as her own, to her boyfriend Alex Dion, 31. The couple were found following a tip off two days after Haynes's body was found, 130 miles away in a homeless shelter in Plymouth, New Hampshire.

Mr Rodriguez was granted full custody of the child who now lives with him and his wife Ana. He married Ana Cruz on 17 August 2009 having applied for the marriage license at Worcester City Hall on the very day that Haynes’s mutilated body was discovered after neighbors complained to their landlord about the smell.

Haynes knew both Corey and Dion through her relationship with Rodriguez.

In closing arguments defense attorney Louis Aloise offered a theory that Haynes was actually killed by Rodriguez who then removed the 4lb infant from her mother’s womb and gave her to Corey.

Speaking of Rodriguez Mr Aloise alleged: ‘He had had it with Darlene Haynes.’

Mr Rodriguez was questioned twice by detectives investigating the case in 2009.

‘I don’t owe it to nobody to try to clear my name in public. It doesn’t bother me what people think.

‘I
 have a lovely family and I’m just trying to raise my daughter the best I
 can. She’s affected by what happened – she is not the same as other 
four-year-olds.’

Mr Rodriguez declined to elaborate on the extent of the physical legacy of his daughter’s violent birth.

The prosecutor described that violence as an act of  ‘extreme atrocity and cruelty.’

As
 far as shocked neighbors who had known both women were concerned there 
had been no reason to suspect that Corey and Haynes were anything other 
than two good friends sharing the excitement of the imminent births of 
their children.

Corey told friends she was expecting a daughter too and that she planned to call her Ailda.

On
 the day of the murder Corey told friends she was giving Haynes a ride 
to a local store. She then called her boyfriend Dion and told him her 
waters had broken and that she had gone into labor.

The
 next morning she presented the premature infant as her own. But the 
umbilical cord raised the suspicion of several witnesses as it had 
clearly not been cut by a doctor and was tied with a bow.

When
 the full horror of the crime emerged with the discovery of Haynes’s 
body, police immediately focused on her estranged boyfriend, Mr 
Rodriguez as a prime suspect.

The couple’s relationship had been marred by violence and difficulty. Hayne’s own family history was fractured and troubled. Her mother left her in the care of her grandmother, Joanne, when she was just six years old.

Speaking to MailOnline this week Joanne admitted that she had never met Mr Rodriguez. She said that in latter years, the granddaughter she has raised as her own had ‘come and gone’ from their lives, sometimes disappearing for months on end.

She said she had seen her great-grandchild – whom Haynes told friends she planned to name Sheila – only once when she was brought round by an official from the Department of Children and Families.

In the weeks before her murder, Haynes had reported Mr Rodriguez to police for an assault.

She told social worker Jessica Bader, who had had various dealings with Haynes, that Mr Rodriguez had thrown his heavily pregnant girlfriend into a glass table and ripped the phone from the wall to prevent her from calling for help.

Mr Rodriguez said: ‘I know what some people think of me. But I don’t care anymore and I don’t have to defend myself.

‘The killer has got what they deserve this is justice. Some people need their 15 minutes of fame. I don’t need that. I don’t want it.’

‘I want my family to be respected and for us to start a fresh chapter in our lives. I want this verdict to be the beginning of that.

‘My daughter didn’t ask for this but she’ll have to live with it. We will tell her in time.

‘But right now I’m done with this. I’m just done. We want to move on that people let us do that.’

Meanwhile, in an emotional hearing in court today, the judge read a statement from Haynes's nine-year-old daughter. It read: 'Julie, it was mean to kill my mother. I think it was very bad that you did that.'
