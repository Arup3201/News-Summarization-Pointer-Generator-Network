An airport in northern Japan was closed today after an unexploded bomb believed to be from the second world war was discovered by construction workers.

All 92 flights in and out of Sendai airport were cancelled and a military bomb disposal unit was called in following the scare.

The 250kg bomb, which was found near a runway during construction work, has been identified as one made in the US.

It appeared to have a working detonator, and the bomb squad was considering whether to move it or explode it on the spot.

Sandbags were piled up around the bomb and Sendai police official, Hiroshi Ouchi, said evacuations of nearby homes were being considered.

Officials said the area had been sealed off and there was no immediate concern that the bomb would explode.

The airport was a Japanese military flight school during the war. It was closed for months due to damage from the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami.

Parts of the airport, which is a major hub for travel in northern Japan, are still being reconstructed.

It is common for bombs that are duds to be uncovered at constructions sites in Japan as many of its cities were bombed during WWII.

By mid-day local time, 'live' webcam links to the airport's flight information boards were still showing cancellations of both domestic and international flights.

The city of Sendai, with a population of more than a million, was very close to the epicentre of the devastating quake.
