American nuns are a 'dying breed'  an in-depth Vatican study has confirmed, prompting concern within the religious community.

The results of a three-year-long investigation released in Rome on Tuesday, told how the current workforce stands at 50,000 compared to 175,000 in the mid-sixties.

And on top of that, the average age of Roman Catholic sisters is mid-to late 70, with few young women stepping in to replace them.

Dwindling numbers: A Vatican report has confirmed fears among the religious community that nuns in the U.S. are a 'dying breed' - here two sisters leave the Vatican after the findings were announced Tuesday

Vatican researchers sent questionnaires and conducted 'sister-to-sister' dialogues at 341 Catholic institutions across the U.S. between 2009 and 2012.

Among the topics of focus were numbers and mission, prayer schedules, living arrangements, financial assets and property. 

'Many sisters expressed great concern . . . for the continuation of their charism and mission, because of the numerical decline in their membership,' the report on the Apostolic Visitation of Institutes of Religious Women in the United States of America said. 

The paper is the result of an investigation launched after some Vatican officials and U.S. bishops voiced concerns over the nuns.

One official suggested they had been infiltrated by 'radical feminism'. The inquiry, begun during the papacy of former Pope Benedict XVI.

However, Tuesday's overwhelmingly positive 12-page report was cheered by the sisters themselves, dozens of whom swarmed the news conference announcing the results in a rare moment of women outnumbering men at the Vatican. 

Sister Sharon Holland, who currently heads the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, acknowledged that the investigation was initially met with apprehension and distrust, particularly among elderly sisters who 'felt that their whole lives had been judged and found wanting.'

But she said the results showed that the Vatican had listened and heard what the sisters had to say.

'There is an encouraging and realistic tone in this report,' she told the news conference. 

'Challenges are understood, but it is not a document of blame, or of simplistic solutions. One can read the text and feel appreciated and trusted to carry on.'

Asked if the change in tone from the start of the process to the end was a reflection of Pope Francis' leadership, Holland said 'I'm willing to give him all sorts of credit.'

'I don't know how to assess entirely his influence in all of this, but he's been a great encouragement and hope to a lot of us,' she said. 

The Vatican officials had suggested some nuns did not fully espouse Church teachings against abortion and homosexuality and that some had become too involved in political issues. 

On a good note: The Vatican went out of its way to mend fences with American religious sisters, thanking them for their selfless work caring for the poor, gently suggesting ways to survive amid a decline in numbers

But Tuesday's report made no reference to any specific criticism and did not dwell on the controversy over the investigation.

It said U.S. orders of nuns 'should carefully review their spiritual practices and ministry to assure that these are in harmony with Catholic teaching' and urged them not to 'displace Christ' while going about their social work.

But it also praised them for 'selflessly tending to the spiritual, moral, educational, physical and social needs of countless individuals, especially the poor and marginalized'.

The report acknowledged that a number of nuns had expressed the need for greater recognition of the role nuns play in the Church and felt women should have more input into decisions that affect them.

Pope Francis, who met a delegation of U.S. nuns on Tuesday, has promised to appoint women to decision-making roles in the Vatican.

The Nun Justice Project, a U.S. group which organized demonstrations to defend the nuns, said the investigation had been a waste of time.

'(The nuns) had to divert precious resources away from ministries to the marginalized just so Rome could discover what Catholics have known all along: U.S. women religious are among the most inspiring and faithful of Catholics,' it said.
