If your supermarket vouchers are stuffed at the bottom of a drawer nearing their expiry date, it's time to take a leaf out of cash-savvy Emma Mumford's book.

The 20-year-old from Dorchester, Dorset saves a staggering £2,000 a MONTH by using coupons and vouchers.

When Emma's relationship ended, she found herself lumped with rent, bills and £7,000 worth of debt, which she couldn't afford.

Emma Mumford saves a staggering £2,000 a MONTH by using coupons and vouchers

So Emma decided to make her wages as a part-time shop assistant in Next stretch as far as possible - by becoming a voucher vulture.

Emma, who so far has struggled to find full time employment, spends 10 hours online each week searching for the latest vouchers, deals and coupons to save her money.

And every month, she saves herself £2,000 on the cost of clothes, food, presents and days out - which amounts to a whopping £24,000 a year.

'Getting a good bargain is addictive. I just love the feeling of saving money and I make sure I never do without,' says Emma.

When 20-year-old Emma's relationship ended she found herself lumped with rent, bills and and £7,000 worth of debt and became obsessed with using coupons

'I have all the same things as my friends, but I still manage to save money at the end of the month,' she adds.

Coupon-crazy Emma has turned her whole life around and converted to a money-saving way of life.

She now no longer buys anything full price and with careful planning she is able to buy presents, food and even holidays for a fraction of their recommended price.

When there is a specific deal on, Emma will make sure she takes full advantage of it and often this means bulk-buying products with offers on such as shampoo and toothpaste.

'When I found myself in a desperate situation with no money, I didn't want to resort to selling everything I owned or getting in trouble with debt collectors,' she explains.

'I knew I needed to make some savings somewhere and I had no idea how I was going to manage,' she says.

'I first heard about extreme couponing from an American TV programme, and ever since I started it has turned my life around.

'It really is a way of life and I don't understand why more people don't take it up.'

Dripping in coupons: Emma has moved back in with her parents and pays minimal rent but has helped the family by slashing their £330 a month food bill in half

'It takes a bit of effort in the beginning but who hasn't got the time to save themselves money?,' she says.

'The key is to be open-minded. People are slaves to brands when in reality cheaper versions are identical.'

Emma moved out of the flat she shared with her ex-partner and now saves £300 a month by living at home with her parents.

Emma says, 'I pay my parents £80 a month rent, which isn't as much as I'd like to, but with my wages that's all they ask for.'

Emma Mumford saves the £95 a month she used to spend on gel nails by using a £10 home nail kit

'But I do my best to save them money with things like the utility bills and food shop. It's my way of helping out,' she says.

Emma makes sure that just because she doesn't splash the cash, she doesn't go without.

She still manages to pamper herself each month with gel nails and a professional haircut and colour - all for just £20.

Emma managed to slash the £95 she would have paid for her nails and hair in a salon too by using a £10 home kit for her nails, which she can do as she is a qualified nail technician.

And she has her hair cut and coloured each month at her local Toni & Guy hairdressers for just £10 by offering to pose as a hair model.

Cash-savvy Emma purchased her entire summer wardrobe in February, for just £60 by taking advantage of online codes and in-store vouchers

'The haircuts are always supervised and I was nervous at first but I would highly recommend it, as it saves so much money and my hair looks great,' she says.

Cash-savvy Emma purchased her entire summer wardrobe in February, for just £60 by taking advantage of online codes and in-store vouchers.

Emma said, 'I'm a self-confessed fashion-lover and always preach Primark over Zara. For my spring/summer 2014 wardrobe, I bought it all in the beginning of February.

'I always find if you buy spring clothes as soon as they are launched they are very cheap. The shops put the prices up as soon as the weather warms up so usually around May.'

'I resent paying £50 for the same white blouse I could buy for £5 in a different shop.' 

Emma Mumford has managed to save £24,000 a year on supermarket shopping, clothes and treats by using coupons

And generous Emma even uses her savings to treat her family. This year, Emma spoiled her mum Jill on Mother's Day without spending a single penny.

She bought Cadbury's chocolates, flowers and a card which should have been £10 for absolutely nothing, after saving up Morrisons' coupons.

And she also won a birthday photo shoot for her mum worth £75 through a local radio competition offering vouchers for the shoot.

'Couponing is a great way for those who are feeling the pinch to get back in control of their finances,' says Emma.

Before Emma's couponing days, the family of three would spend £330 a month on food and drink.

But now Emma has convinced her parents to shop around and ditch the brands, she has slashed the family's food bill in half and now they spend just £10 a head, per week.

Emma said, 'I have created a giant stockpile of things like toothpaste and shampoo which will last at least six months, so that costs me nothing.'

On days out with her boyfriend Mitch, Emma will always use BOGOF vouchers and she will stay in with a bottle of discount wine, over expensive nights out in clubs.

Emma has even blagged a two day holiday to Disneyland Paris for her 21st birthday with her parents, all expenses included, for just £93 a head instead of the £900 RRP.

Emma said: 'I would never go back to frittering money away, couponing and saving money is now my way of life.

'The savings I have made mean that my finances are now getting back on trackand I don't have to worry each month.'
