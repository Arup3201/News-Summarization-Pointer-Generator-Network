'We have received no specific request to engage in actual military action against ISIL, nevertheless we have received a general request and we are considering what we may be able to make available,' Mr Abbott said.

'No specific decision has been made.'

To date, the Australian involvement has been limited to humanitarian air-drops to communities on Mount Sinjar and Amerli

He has told parliament that 'Australia will do what it can to respond to this developing situation'.

Australian aircraft have been involved in two humanitarian air-drops and also the air-lifting of military equipment to Kurdish forces.

Mr Abbott again stressed the specific objectives and roles of Australian troops would be assessed ahead of any deployment. 

"It boasts of evil, it's proud of evil, it advertises its evil,' Mr Abbott said of the militant group he has labelled 'death cult'.
