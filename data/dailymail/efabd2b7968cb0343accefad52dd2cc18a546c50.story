Great Britain's 4x100metres relay team will be without the fastest man in Europe after newly crowned individual champion James Dasaolu revealed he was ‘very doubtful’ to take part in the event.

The 26-year-old has never represented Britain in a relay at a major championships but will stay in Zurich until Sunday to watch his team-mates, who won silver at the Commonwealth Games.

‘My focus for this European Championships has solely been on the individual so I don’t really want to mess too much with their chemistry,’ said Dasaolu, who ran 10.06sec to win the 100m on Wednesday.

‘It’s probably very doubtful I’ll be in the relay unless I’m needed,’ he added. ‘Going forward to next season I’d love to be a part of the relay and be involved in the set-up and go to their training camps.’

Meanwhile, the youngest athlete at the championships, 17-year-old Morgan Lake, is targeting a new personal best in the high jump.

The heptathlete, who became double junior world champion in Oregon last month, is only competing in one event in Zurich.

‘It’s my first international event as a senior,’ said Lake. ‘Its quite weird being here with athletes I’ve watched on TV when I was younger, hanging around in the hotel with them and having lunch with Dwain Chambers. I sometimes feel young but I know I am capable of competing at this level.’

Lake is sharing a room with fellow teenager Dina Asher-Smith, who has qualified for tonight’s 200m final, and will be hoping to share in some of her success.
