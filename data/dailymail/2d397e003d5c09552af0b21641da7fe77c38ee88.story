A man has been charged with murder after a married couple were subjected to a 'violent and sustained' attack in their £750,000 home.

Lithuanian builder Viktoras Bruzas, 38, appeared at South East Surrey Magistrates' Court in Redhill today on two counts of murder.

Patrick Kettyle, 55, and his wife Gillian Kettyle, 54, were found dead at their Surrey home shortly after midnight on Thursday after police received a call from Mrs Kettyle's 16-year-old son, Timothy.

Police confirmed that Bruzas knew Mr Kettyle (pictured) and his wife, and said this relationship was an ‘important part’ of their investigation. Bruzas was found less than five miles from the scene of the murder

Their deaths sparked a police search for Lithuanian builder  Bruzas, 38, who was found later in Oxshott - less than five miles from the scene and arrested on suspicion of murder.

A clean-shaven Bruzas, from Walton-on-Thames, wore a navy sweater and grey tracksuit bottoms when he appeared in the dock today, flanked by two guards.

The Lithuanian builder spoke only to confirm his age and address during a brief appearance.

Kristina Bruziene is reportedly the estranged wife of Bruzas. She was employed by the dead couple as a secretary in 2012

He has been remanded in custody to appear before Guildford Crown Court on Tuesday.

Police confirmed that Bruzas and the Kettyle family were known to each other, and said this relationship was an ‘important part’ of their investigation.

Mr Kettyle had employed Bruzas’s ex-wife, Kristina Bruziene, 37, as a secretary at his million-pound building and property development firm after the builder introduced them.

Bruzas grew up in Kaunas, Lithuania, the country’s second biggest city, 65 miles west of the capital, Vilnius.

He married his wife in Lithuania before they moved to the UK in their twenties. The couple settled in Forest Gate, East London, and had their son Richard, who was born in September 2007.

Bruzas was known by his neighbours as a quiet man who worked hard to support his family. 

The full results of the post mortems, as well as formal identification of the couple, are expected next week but the initial cause of death has been established as stab wounds.

Detective Superintendent Nick May, from the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team, said they were killed in a 'significant, violent and sustained' attack. 

Detective Chief Inspector Mark Preston, from the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team, said after their murders: 'This is a tragic incident which has shaken the close community in Fetcham.

'I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who assisted with the search of Viktoras Bruzas including members of the public and the media.' 

Prior to Bruzas' arrest, police had been liaising with both the National Crime Agency and Interpol who were in touch with the Lithuanian authorities.

Another man in his 30s who was arrested at a property in Walton-on-Thames in Surrey on Thursday has been released with no further action taken against him, police said.

Officers were called to The Copse, a quiet street of detached houses in Fetcham, at around 12.30am on Thursday.

Police said that the murders had shaken the close community in Fetcham. Above, the house was cordoned off as the police searched the area after the attack

Police set up at the scene. Senior officers said they had been working with the National Crime Agency and Interpol in a bid to track down the Lithuanian

Fetcham is a leafy commuter village in Surrey, just south of the M25. The sleepy road where the murders took place was cordoned off by police
