Sam Allardyce branded Louis van Gaal’s side ‘Long-ball United’ after West Ham were denied victory by a late goal.

Daley Blind snatched a point in second-half stoppage time after Manchester United resorted to pumping long balls up the pitch and into West Ham’s penalty area.

They were trailing to Cheikhou Kouyate’s strike until right at the death when Carl Jenkinson misguided a headed clearance into Blind’s path.

West Ham manager Allardyce said: ’In the end we couldn’t cope with Long-ball United. It's not how you normally see United play, but it got them a goal in the end.

‘You might just criticise Louis Van Gaal for playing long balls as much as I’m sometimes criticised for being direct. In the end it’s paid off for them so you can’t knock it.’

Despite the draw, Allardyce was proud of his side’s resolute display: ‘It was a terrific performance from all who took part, they excited the crowd but with the quality Manchester United have you know they will be a threat. They were a bit fortunate but it was a great finish from Blind.

‘We were good at getting the ball quickly to our front two. The chances we had, the trouble we caused them. Blocking off Falcao, RVP, Rooney, Di Maria, barely got a look in until the end,’ added Allardyce.

‘Restricting Man United to such little and stifling them going forward was fantastic and I thought we deserved a 2-0 nil lead but sadly we couldn’t grab a famous victory.'

The Manchester United boss even admitted afterwards that it has been his Plan B in games this season to get Marouane Fellaini on the pitch and pump passes up to him. The towering forward was thrown on with 18 minutes remaining.

‘I have done that already a lot of times with Fellaini so that is not new,’ Van Gaal revealed. ‘I think also West ham should know that.

‘With him we have more power. With Adnan Januzaj and Angel Di Maria, we have more creative players. That's why the second ball you cannot always win, with these players. 

'But you have to win, otherwise I have to line-up always players like Fellaini.’

Van Gaal ripped into his side’s lacklustre opening 45 performance: ‘I think we played very bad in the first-half but showed a lot of resilience in the second-half.

‘We need the guts to play football along the floor. We didn’t in the first-half. We did in the second.

‘After the goal, then we finally played football but you have to do that from the start. But I must say what spirit from my team.’

Luke Shaw was sent off late on for a second bookable offence when he scythed down Stewart Downing. But van Gaal disagreed with referee Mike Clattenburg’s decision, adding: ‘He doesn't touch him. It was in front of me. The player was jumping, but I think it was tactically not so smart of Shaw.’
