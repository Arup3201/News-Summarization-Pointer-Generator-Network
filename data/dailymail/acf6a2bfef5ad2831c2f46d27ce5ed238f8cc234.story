Linebacker Erik Walden and his girlfriend were seriously injured in an attack that took place Saturday evening.

The ex-girlfriend of the Indianapolis Colts star, Erica Palmer, broke into his house through a backdoor and attacked him and his girlfriend, whose name has not been released, with a bat.

The two allegedly found Palmer sitting on the couch with a loaded gun waiting to attack, and as they tried to leave for the hospital after she broke the woman's arm with the bat, Palmer surprised them by jumping out of the woods and slashing Walden's arm with a knife.

All this as Palmer left the two young children she has with Walden alone in a car a mile away.

NBC 11 reports that Palmer suspected that Walden was seeing other woman, so she parked the car a mile away to see if she could catch him in the act.

After the two came in shortly before midnight and saw Palmer with the gun, Walden, who owns the weapon, managed to wrestle it away from the woman.

Walden claims that Palmer then began swinging the bat at the two, breaking his female companion's arm. 

Palmer fled after this and Walden called police, who came, took a statement and left.

Then, when Walden left to drive the female to the hospital to have her arm treated, Palmer jumped out of the woods with a knife and slashed his arm.

Police were able to locate Palmer soon after using her cell phone to track her and she has been charged with multiple crimes, including  several counts of aggravated assault.

The two young children have been placed in Walden's care and Palmer is being held at the Hall County Jail.
