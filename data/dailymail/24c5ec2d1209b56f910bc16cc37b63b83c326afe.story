Dominique Strauss-Kahn has appeared in public for the first time with his new girlfriend.

The disgraced former head of the International Monetary Fund was on the red carpet at Cannes with new companion, Myriam L’Aouffir.

It was confirmation that the pair are together, following his split last year from his long-suffering wife of 20 years, Anne Sinclair.

Movie date: The couple attended a screening of 'Plein Soleil' during the Cannes Film Festival

The pair were rumoured last September to have started dating but this appearance appeared to be the first public confirmation. They attended  the screening of a French film, Full Sun, starring veteran actor Alain Delon.

At 43 years-old, Miss L’Aouffir is 20 years younger than her infamous economist boyfriend.

Like Mr Strauss-Kahn, she comes from a Moroccan background, and is also believed to be estranged from her husband, with whom she has two children. She works in marketing.

Strauss-Kahn faced a series of accusations over sexual abuse and pimping

Mr Strauss-Kahn last December agreed a financial settlement with the hotel maid whose 2011 allegation of sexual assault forced him to resign from the International Monetary Fund.

Strauss-Kahn - once tipped as a Socialist French president - was accused of trying to rape chambermaid Nafissatou Diallo at a Sofitel Hotel in New York.

After being held in the city’s notorious Rikers Island prison, criminal charges were dropped.

He then returned to France last year only to face accusations of sexually abusing a young French writer.

French judges agreed there was a case against Strauss-Kahn, but had to drop it because the alleged attack happened more than a decade ago.

Strauss-Kahn was then charged with conspiring with pimps in Lille, northern France, to procure girls for sex parties around the world.

His interest in movies may be soon tested however.

A film starring Jacqueline Bisset - who plays his former wife - and Gerard Depardieu as Mr Strauss-Kahn which recreates the drama around the 2011 incident is expected to be released later this year.

Mr Strauss-Kahn’s New York arrest ultimately destroyed his ambitions for the French presidency.

A gifted orator, fluent in English and German, the silver-haired high-flier had been seen as a likely challenger to president Nicolas Sarkozy in the 2012 election, won by Francois Hollande.
