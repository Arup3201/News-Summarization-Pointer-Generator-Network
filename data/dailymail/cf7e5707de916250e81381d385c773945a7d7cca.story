The sister and father of a Malaysia Airlines worker due to fly on MH17 were left reeling with shock when they heard about the massacre – but unbeknown to them, their loved one was safe and sound, because she’d given up her seat on the doomed flight to another passenger.

Nina Corder, from Toledo, Ohio, spoke of the hours of agony she went through with her father when they heard about the horrifying missile attack.

Ms Corder said her father had called her last Thursday to tell her the chilling news that her sister, Wani Hashim, had been killed.

Relieved: Nina Corder thought that her sister had died on MH17 - but she'd given up her seat at the last minute

She told Fox 5 Vegas: ‘My dad started shaking. He was like, “I don't know what to do. You need to do something.”’

Ms Corder, who works in downtown Toledo, said that she tried for several hours to get clarification on exactly what had happened, and whether her sister was safe.

She tried her sister’s cell phone over and over again, but to no avail. ‘I just started crying,’ she said.

But after several attempts, to her astonishment – and joy – she got through and her sister answered.

‘I picked up my phone and I dialed her again and then I heard her voice say, “Hello!”’, Corder said.

It turns out that the flight had been overbooked so Wani changed her plans and flew to Paris instead, where she prepared for a meeting in London.

After the plane crashed in eastern Ukraine, she immediately sent her sister a text. It said: ‘I gave up my seat for another passenger. OMG, I nearly took that flight.’

The family are incredibly grateful, but are all too aware that someone else perished instead of Wani.

Corder added: ‘I think it's not her time. It's just a miracle.’

Meanwhile, bodies of the dead from the downed Malaysia Airlines plane have arrived in Holland to be received by a nation in mourning.

Doomed: MH17 is seen taking off from Schiphol Airport last Thursday - a short while later it was shot down in a missile attack over eastern Ukraine with the deaths of all 298 people on board

Two transport planes, one Dutch and one Australian, flew in to Holland's Eindhoven airport from the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv carrying 40 coffins.

They touched down to the sound of tolling bells just before 3pm UK time and were greeted by Dutch king Willem-Alexander and queen Maxima as well as by Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte.

Relatives of the 298 people, including 10 Britons, who died aboard flight MH17 were also at Eindhoven.

Waiting at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport was Barry Sweeney, father of Newcastle United football fan Liam Sweeney, who was on board MH17 on his way to see his team play in a pre-season friendly in New Zealand.

Devastating: Debris and bodies from the flight were scattered over eight square miles of countryside

He told ITV News that the grieving families 'need closure' through the return of the victims' bodies and their burials. He also spoke about how it feels to walk in his son's footsteps, making the same journey to Amsterdam just six days after his son.

To mark the arrival of the bodies in Holland the Union flag and Dutch flag were being flown at half-mast over Downing Street in London.

It is the Netherlands that has bore the brunt of the tragedy, with 193 Dutch lives lost, including many children.

Even as the planes were flying to Eindhoven, news came through of further violence in the Ukraine, with reports that two Ukrainian military fighter jets had been shot down about 20 miles south of the MH17 crash site.
