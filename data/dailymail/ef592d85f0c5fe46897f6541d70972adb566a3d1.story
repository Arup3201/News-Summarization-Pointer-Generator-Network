Failed: Staff first detected Patricia McQuade's cancer when she was admitted to hospital in September 2013 after breaking her arm in a fall

A hospital has apologised after doctors failed to treat a great-grandmother's cancer - even though they detected a tumour eight months before she died.

Patricia McQuade, 66, died from pneumonia 12 hours after being admitted to the Royal Sunderland Hospital in May.

But her family were only told that she had cancer, which hospital staff detected in September 2013, hours before she died - despite asking for details on her deteriorating condition.

Medical staff revealed that the tumour had been picked up in a chest X-ray taken when the grandmother broke her arm eight months earlier and that no one had acted on the discovery.

Mrs McQuade's son Danny, 45, and partner Joanne Knebel, have spent months trying to find out why no one acted on the tumour when it was detected.

Sales assistant Miss Knebel, 39, said: 'She just deteriorated from an independent woman into someone who could do very little.

'The doctors apologised but I wonder what it would’ve been like for them if they had to watch someone they loved wish she was dead for the last five weeks of her life.

'She’d lost all of her dignity. She was so thin you could see the bones sticking out of her.'

Mr McQuade added: 'We never got the chance to tell her she had cancer before she died.'

Mrs McQuade, a grandmother of six and great-grandmother of five, was admitted to the Sunderland Royal Hospital in September 2013 after breaking her arm in a fall.

The 4.4cm tumour was picked up by a chest X-ray, which was carried out because doctors thought she might have had a chest infection.

But the information was never shared with Mrs McQuade, her family or any other hospital departments and after treatment for her broken arm, she was discharged.

In the following eight months she became increasingly frail was eventually admitted back to the hospital with pneumonia.

Apology: Bosses at Sunderland Royal Hospital apologised for failing to act after a chest X-ray detected Mrs McQuade's cancer and said they had investigated the situation surrounding the failure

Following her death Mr McQuade and Miss 
Knebel met with NHS trust bosses who gave gave them the details of a 
full investigation into what had happened.

They apologised to her family, who say they are considering legal action, and pledged that lessons must be learned.

Mr McQuade, who works as a customer manager, said: 'She could have had a couple of extra months with us at least if this was picked up.

'For the last part of her life, we could have had help and support from people like Macmillan nurses if we’d known she had cancer, but we didn’t and the pain and sorrow we feel is terrible.

'Another thing we wonder is how many people this has happened too.'

A report by Home Office pathologist Dr Jennifer Bolton, stated: 'It is certainly possible that the tumour had already spread at the time of the first X-ray.'

She added: 'It may be likely that some form of palliative therapy would have been offered.

'It is likely that ultimately the cause of Mrs McQuade’s death would have remained the same even had the tumour been identified sooner with bronchopneumonia representing the terminal event.'

A spokeswoman for City Hospitals Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We would like to extend our sympathies once again to Mrs McQuade’s family on their sad loss.

'We have investigated the circumstances surrounding the failure to review Mrs McQuade’s X-ray and have met with her family to discuss the findings and to apologise for this error.

'Clearly in any investigation like this there are always lessons to be learned and we have, and will continue to, review our processes to minimise the risk of a similar incident happening in the future.'
