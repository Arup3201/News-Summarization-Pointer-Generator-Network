A heavily pregnant woman and two accomplices murdered a pensioner with a hammer to get to a safe where they thought he had stashed £30,000.

But when Daniel Davies, his stepbrother Troy Schuldt and Davies’ former girlfriend Samantha Smith opened the safe, there was only one dollar inside.

Victim Daniel Spires, 69, was lured to a Hertfordshire wood by the two men and throttled with a rope before his head was smashed in with a hammer.

Cold-blooded killers: Samantha Smith, left, plotted the brutal murder with her ex-boyfriend Daniel Davies and his stepbrother Troy Schuldt

The trio responsible for the brutal murder were jailed today at St Albans Crown Court for a minimum total of 77 years.

Mr Spires, who was nicknamed the 'scrap metal man', had few friends and his killers thought he would not be missed, the court heard.

But they confessed to others and were arrested, 
more than three months later, after Mr Spires’ remains were found in undergrowth in a wood at Welham Green, where he had been left 
by Schuldt and Davies.

Smith, 21, of St Albans, was convicted of 
murder despite not being at the scene of the killing, and 
of obstructing the coroner by not revealing where the body was. The mother of two 
was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 21 years.

Davies, 24, of St Albans, and
 Schuldt, 20, of no fixed address, denied murder 
between 12 and 15 June last year, but were convicted and sentenced to 
life with a minimum term of 28 years.

Smith pleaded guilty to two charges of assisting an offender in relation to Schuldt and was convicted unanimously by the jury of two charges of assisting an offender in relation to Davies.

'Scrap metal man': The defendants did not think Daniel Spires, 69, would be missed, because he had few friends

Schuldt pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice and obstructing the coroner. Davies was found guilty of obstructing the coroner.

Stuart Trimmer QC, for the Crown Prosecution Service, said that the partially decomposed body of Mr Spires, who had looked like an 'aged rocker', was found on 24 September last year.

The defendants, who at the time were on benefits and all lived in St Albans, had been regular visitors to his address in London Colney near St Albans in the period before his murder.

He was last seen with his large and distinctive Mercedes Sprinter van on June 13 last year.

Mr Trimmer said: 'He bought and sold items and had a metal safe. It is this safe that appears to be a central feature in the murder. These defendants believed it contained £30,000 in cash. That safe was removed after the murder and has not yet been recovered by the police.

'The murder of Daniel Spires was not a spur of the moment event, but a planned crime specifically to take the money they believed to be in the safe and any other items of value which they could sell.'

Emma Blee, who knew the stepbrothers, heard them say they had taken the safe from the wardrobe at Mr Spires’ home in London Colney to discover it contained just a dollar. The safe was never recovered.

Schudlt later confessed that Mr Spires was tricked into going with him and Davies to the woods when they said they had some catalytic converters to sell him .

'He was attacked there in the van, but not killed. After being throttled with a rope he was dragged out of the van. The rope was tightened using a hammer handle as a tourniquet.'

He was beaten and kicked by Davies and Schuldt hit his head with the hammer until he died.

'They did this some way into the undergrowth and then used some nearby foliage to conceal the body,' said the prosecutor.

After finding there was only $1 in the safe, the callous killers sold off Mr Spires’ property for sale. His jewellery was taken from his body along with his keys, wallet and phone.

The van was placed for sale on the Gumtree website and was eventually swapped for a red VW Polo by Davies, who then put that for sale on Gumtree.

Other items belonging to the dead man that were put up for sale included a pressure washer, a suitcase, generator, a PC, a flat-screen TV, a mini safe and external hard drives.

Schuldt told his stepsister Hayley Davies: 'Me and Daniel killed our mate Danny. He was mugging us off so we took him to the woods and did him over.'

Schuldt confessed he had hit him with a hammer and they had both kicked and punched him. He  was later seen wearing a chain belonging to the dead man.

They were arrested after Keely Charlton, Schuldt’s ex-girlfriend, told a friend what she had learned.

She passed the information to a college tutor, who called the police.

The prosecutor said Mr Spires was a safe target. If he were to go missing his disappearance would neither be quickly noticed nor reported.

'It was also known that he was going to take a lengthy trip abroad. Daniel Spires was a man who was estranged from his family. He had few friends and counted Daniel Davies as one of them,' he said.

Mr Trimmer said Smith’s flat was the base from where the plan was executed. He added: 'Samantha Smith was part of the group trusted with the knowledge of the plan and the execution of it. It started from her flat, it returned to her flat.

'Her flat was the place where all were free to change out of bloody clothes and to dispose of them. Although not at the scene of the murder she was part of its planning and assisted in its execution.'

Judge Andrew Bright QC told them: 'You were all three involved in the planning and killing of Daniel Spires in order to break into his property and steal the safe which I am sure you believed contained £30,000.

'I am in no doubt the plan involved throttling him with a rope and, if necessary, finishing him off with a hammer.

'I am quite certain that you, Samantha Smith, knew the co-defendants were off to commit a murder and that you were happy to allow them to use your flat as a base and a safe house.'

The judge praised the investigation carried out by the Beds and Herts Major Crime Unit saying: 'This was a complicated and challenging investigation which was put together in an efficient way to be easily understood by the jury.'

The judge mentioned in particular DC Katie Jackson, DS Mark Devine and Senior Investigating Officer DI Jerome Kent.
