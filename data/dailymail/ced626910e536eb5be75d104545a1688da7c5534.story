Italian coastguards returned to port to a hero's welcome on Saturday after they delivered the baby of a desperate African immigrant  following her dramatic rescue from a stricken boat off the coast of Sicily.

The crew of the Italian navy frigate, named Euro, were forced into action minutes after dragging the heavily-pregnant mother on board as they rescued an overcrowded dinghy that had run into trouble in rough seas.

Despite a lack of sterile hospital conditions, the on-board doctor, with the help of crew members, successfully delivered the baby girl before returning to harbour, where they were greeted with rapturous applause from well-wishers who had gathered to welcome the new arrival.

Healthy: Both mother and daughter - who was named Yambambi Yete - were reported to be doing fine after being taken to hospital in Reggio Calabria for check ups

Happy news: Despite a lack of sterile hospital conditions, the on-board doctor, with the help of crew members, successfully delivered the baby girl before returning to harbour, where they were greeted with rapturous applause from well-wishers who had gathered to welcome the new arrival

Both mother and daughter - who was named Yambambi Yete - were reported to be doing fine after being taken to hospital in Reggio Calabria for check ups.

She was among 600 would-be immigrants rescued from the Mediterranean sea this weekend - a consignment of human misery that included 24 minors and one paraplegic woman. 

It was a welcome piece of good news for Italy's border control, whose personnel too often face pulling the dead and dying from the Mediterranean sea as more and more refugees attempt to make the perilous crossing from north Africa each year.

Technically the new arrival was born on Italian sovereign territory, which may increase the family's chances of being allowed to stay in Europe.

'At 15.23 on Saturday, we had the pride, happiness and joy to witness the birth of little Yambambi Yete, a Gambian national,' said the ship's captain, Cristian Nardone. 'It was a natural birth overseen by our on-board medical officer, Dr. Cesca, and Warrant Nurse Moscato. For them, it was their first experience of this kind, not only aboard a ship.'

Cramped: The crew of the Italian navy frigate, named Euro, were forced into action minutes after dragging the heavily-pregnant mother on board as they rescued a cramped rubber dinghy that had run into trouble in rough seas

Good news: It was a rare piece of good news for Italy's border control, whose personel are more used to pulling the dead and dying from the Mediterranean sea as more and more refugees attempt to make the perilous crossing from north Africa each year

Rescued: She was among 600 would-be immigrants rescued from the Mediterranean sea this weekend - a consignment of human misery that included 24 minors and one paraplegic woman

Desperate: Many migrants trying to reach Italy from Africa, often in overcrowded, unseaworthy vessels operated by ruthless people traffickers, are fleeing strife in their countries of origin

Dangerous crossing: This year has seen a surge in the numbers attempting to make the hazardous crossing from north Africa, with more than 100,000 having reached Italy since the turn of the year and nearly 2,000 having perished in the attempt

Many migrants trying to reach Italy from Africa, often in overcrowded, unseaworthy vessels operated by ruthless people traffickers, are fleeing strife in their countries of origin.

Yambambi and her mother were part of a group of more than 600 picked up by the Euro over this weekend - a consignment of human misery that includes 24 minors and one paraplegic woman.

This year has seen a surge in the numbers attempting to make the hazardous crossing from north Africa, with more than 100,000 having reached Italy since the turn of the year and nearly 2,000 having perished in the attempt, according to the UN refugee body UNHCR.

The implosion of Libya and conflicts in Eritrea, Iraq, Syria and Somalia have helped drive the upward trend, putting major pressure on Italy's rapid-reaction rescue operation, 'Mare Nostrum', which the European Union has agreed to take over later this year.
