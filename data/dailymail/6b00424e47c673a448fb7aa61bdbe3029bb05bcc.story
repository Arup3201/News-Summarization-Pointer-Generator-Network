The Irish have a reputation for enjoying a drink or two - partly due to TV characters such as Father Ted's Jack and the pub regulars in Mrs Browns' Boys.

Now, a study of students has confirmed what many have believed all along - that those from the Emerald Isle do drink more than their international counterparts.

The study, from University College Dublin (UCD), pins the blame on family drinking habits, same-sex schools and even if there's a cricket club nearby.

A map by researchers from the University College Dublin shows how much the average Irish student drinks a year, by county. Students from counties shown in blue drink in excess of 351 units of alcohol a year. Students in Monagh, Donegal, Tiperrary and Carlow drink the least per year - between 200 and 250 units each

Support is growing for the introduction of drink-driving permits on rural Irish roads as a second council is set to hear a motion on the proposal.

Councillors in County Kerry already backed a change in the law that would allow drinkers in rural areas to drive after having 'two or three drinks'.

But despite widespread criticism of the proposal, originally put forward by pub owner and Independent councillor Danny Healy-Rae, a councillor in another county has expressed support.

Independent Galway councillor Michael Fahy said in January he would raise the idea at the next sitting of his council's policy committee.

He disagreed that more lax rules would lead to more road deaths, saying: 'We don't want to see people drunk, we're only talking about up to three pints.'

Researchers asked 3,500 students - with an average age of 21 - about their alcohol consumption.

The research provided a fascinating insight into how the culture of the country affected drinking.

Boys who attended same-sex schools or boarding schools also drank more 
in college, according to this study, than boys who attended mixed-sex establishments. 

How much a student's siblings drink also played a part, and affected male and female students equally. 

Geographically,
the researchers found that towns with a higher population of Catholics 
drank less, on average, than towns with either a dominant Protestant 
community or towns with no strong religious following.

For example, towns where more masses took place per week raised students who drank less.

And
counties in which the legalisation of divorce was supported during the 
1996 referendum - a move that was opposed by the Catholic Church - had 
higher drinking levels.

The research also found that people who lived in towns that had a cricket club drank more than other Irish towns.

Participants were also asked questions about their family background and where they grew up, so the researchers could compare domestic and geographical influences.

Respondents
were then asked about the drinking habits of mothers and fathers and 
for each sibling over age 16, plus the town in which they lived at age 
10 and the 
secondary school they attended.

According to research from UCD, Irish students drink more than their international counterparts. One in seven of the 3,500 Irish students questioned said they drank at least two drinks a day, while only five per cent said they didn't drink at all

Characters such as Father Jack, played by Irishman Frank Kelly (pictured) and renowned for repeatedly shouting for a 'drink' during the show have fueled the stereotype that Irish people like to drink alcohol

The
researchers found that students from the Republic of Ireland drank 
more, on average, than international students from the UK and U.S - 
compared to previous studies on drinking habits from those regions.

They were then able to create a map showing the annual volume of alcoholic drinking by Irish students broken down by county.

Of
the 3,500 people asked, five percent of them did not drink at all while
one in seven consumed, on average, more than two drinks every day.

In general, drinking concentrated on a few days per week of very heavy drinking.

For example, eight percent of students 
drank 10 or more drinks on the occasions that they consumed alcohol, 
while one in five drank between seven and nine drinks each time they 
consumed alcohol.

While their parents' education, age, marital status and income played little part in determining how much they drank, if their parents - especially their mothers - drank, they did too. A father's drinking, on the other hand, only influenced the drinking habits of sons.

The study said: 'We find that drinking of mothers significantly impacts the number of drinks consumed by both female and male students about equally.

'But drinking of fathers appears only to influence drinking of their college-attending sons.'

The researchers claimed this was because cricket is an English import and places that had a strong English cultural influence drank more.

The research team also checked whether 
the average rainfall and temperature of a region played a part in the 
amount its residents drank, yet they could find no evidence to suggest 
this.

Irish cricketers celebrate taking the last wicket of Zimbabwe during the 2007 ICC World Cup Cricket. Research from UCD discovered that students who lived in towns with a cricket club drank more. The study claimed this was because cricket is an English import and places with a strong English cultural influence drank more

Commenting on the research, Discover Magazine said: 'This is a nice study, although it does suffer from being a student sample and purely self-report.

It’s also a useful reminder of the importance of not confusing correlation with causation.

Living near a cricket club clearly doesn’t cause anyone to drink more. It’s a marker for other cultural factors, no less real, but hard to measure directly.

But it is easy to forget this, to see only the tangible tip of the iceberg and overlook the true causes beneath the surface.'
