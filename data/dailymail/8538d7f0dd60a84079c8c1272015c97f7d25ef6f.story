Just five days after basking in the warmest Halloween on record, Britain is braced for temperatures to dip below freezing on Bonfire Night.

The mercury hit 23.6C (74.5F) in London and Kent on October 31, but could fall as low as -7C (19.4F) in northern Scotland tomorrow.

But forecasters said tomorrow’s weather is quite normal for November, and it will only seem so cold to Britons because of the balmy autumn.

Temperatures in urban areas could fall to about 0C (32F) on November 5, but dip below freezing to -3C (26.6F) in rural areas, the Met Office said.

The UK low is likely to be close to the -7.8C (18F) seen at the summit of the Cairn Gorm mountain in the Scottish Highlands on Bonfire Night last year.

The previous two years saw Bonfire Night lows of -5.3C (22.5F) at Shap, Cumbria, in 2012, and -2.9C (26.8F) at Cromdale in the Highlands in 2011.

Met Office forecaster Nicky Maxey told MailOnline today: ‘Tomorrow's going to the nicest day of the week - plenty of sunshine around.

‘But the night-time temperatures might dip a bit. The further north you go, the lower they are. It's all fairly typical for November.

‘The issue is that we've had quite a mild period, so although these temperatures are fairly typical for this time of year, we've got that contrast.’

Morning frost: A hand print on a car windowscreen in Leeds. Tonight will see scattered showers for the northern and eastern coast

Tonight will see scattered showers for northern and eastern coastal Britain, eastern English Channel coasts, south-west England and west Wales.

Showers will also be seen tomorrow for eastern coastal parts of Britain, and in particular, East Anglia and Kent.

Scattered showers for west Wales and south-west England for a time, but for the rest of the UK, it will be a mainly dry day with sunny periods.

On Thursday it will be wet and windy at first in Northern Ireland and western fringes of Britain, but drier elsewhere.

As the day progresses, the rain and strong winds will spread eastwards, finally reaching the far east of England by the end of the day.

Eastern England will see rain clear early on Friday, joining the rest of the UK in a bright but showery day, and it will be blustery across southern parts.

Hottest Halloween on record: Just five days ago, on October 31, this couple were relaxing in the sunshine at London's Green Park

Last Friday the UK record for the warmest Halloween was smashed, as Kew Gardens in west London and Gravesend in Kent both hit 23.6C (74.5F).

This beat the previous high of 20C (68F) set at Dartford in Kent in 1968. Conditions were warmer than those in Rome, Barcelona and San Francisco.

So far, 2014 is the warmest year on record, following consistently mild temperatures which have continued into autumn, according to MeteoGroup.

Bookmakers BetVictor said today they have seen a flurry of bets at 5/2 that November will record the highest mean temperature on record.

This would have to beat the 11.39C (52.5F) set in 2006. Other prices available are 16/1 that it will be the driest, and 12/1 that it will be the wettest.
