Ever wondered what a medieval battle looks like from inside the knight's armour?

Prepare to time warp, thanks to this video, which is filmed from the perspective of one of the full-contact combat fighters.

The footage was captured using a GoPro camera during a medieval combat tournament earlier this month.

Huzzah! Experience a medieval battle from an insider's perspective

One of the biggest mock historical battles, the Black Hawk tournament was held at the Faucon Noir Fortress in Montbazon, France.

The fighter gives a first person point-of-view of the 'Aquila Sequania' team dressed as knights fighting with historically accurate metal weaponry.

While it's unclear which side ultimately came out on top, at one point, we do get to see the battle from the fighter's vantage point - lying on his back on the ground.
