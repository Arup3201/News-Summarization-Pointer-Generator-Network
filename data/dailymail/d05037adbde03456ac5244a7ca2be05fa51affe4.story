Paula Stevenson, seen here with a picture of her baby girl Hayley, describe her daughter's treatment at Birmingham Children's Hospital as 'brutal'

A coroner has questioned if a baby girl who died in hospital was under the care of ‘work experience’ nurses.

He made the remark yesterday after hearing that one-year-old Hayley Fullerton had been looked after by clinical support workers who had made errors on her medical notes.

This included ‘incorrect’ entries and one afternoon that saw an eight-hour gap in observation notes on Hayley’s condition.

The little girl died of a massive heart attack at Birmingham  Children’s Hospital after medical staff ignored her family’s desperate pleas to help her.

At one stage, her despairing mother even offered a £100 ‘bribe’ to a nurse to pay more attention to Hayley.

Yesterday, coroner Aidan Cotter heard that, in the days before she died, Hayley was put under the care of clinical support workers.

These are NHS workers who are paid less than qualified nurses and recruited for their ‘commitment and enthusiasm’ rather than any academic qualifications.

The coroner said: ‘This was more “work experience”, somewhat?’

Senior nurse Jackie Clinton, manager of the ward Hayley was on, denied this, replying: ‘No, not work experience. They go through a period of six to eight months’ training, including observation, monitoring and how to read notes.’

But Mrs Clinton conceded that the clinical support workers looking after Hayley had made ‘incorrect’ entries on her medical notes.

Hayley Fullerton was born with a hole in her heart, and had to undergo surgery aged 10-months-old to correct it

It was during the recovery from the surgery when complications arose, ultimately leading to her tragic death

She also accepted that, on one day, they had failed to update the notes all afternoon, leaving an eight-hour gap in observations of Hayley’s condition. Hourly observations were supposed to be done to help doctors correctly assess Hayley, the inquest heard.

Mrs Clinton, who agreed nurses had ignored the hospital’s policy of hourly check-ups, said there were not enough nurses to go round.

She added that Hayley was being monitored by machines which sounded an alarm if there was any problem – but agreed that these alarms were often ignored.

Paula Stevenson told an inquest her one-year-old daughter was overlooked and neglected at the hospital

She said: ‘At that time, we had a high
number of patients who needed high dependency care. Nurses often have 
three patients. They can’t put down children and go to the alarm every 
time.’

Adam Weitzman, representing Hayley’s 
family, put it to Mrs Clinton that Hayley was put under the care of 
clinical support workers because nurses regarded her condition as less 
serious than other children on the ward.

Hayley was born with a blockage which 
stopped blood reaching her lungs. She was operated on shortly after her 
birth in Northern Ireland, and sent for further surgery in Birmingham in
October 2009.

Hayley Fullerton with her grandparents, Edward 
and Sylvia Stevenson, both helped keep a bedside vigil for the four 
weeks Hayley spent in hospital before her death

 The operation was a success but 
complications arose when staff inserted a tube into Hayley incorrectly, 
causing her lung to collapse.

Her parents and grandparents kept a 
vigil by her bedside but failed to convince staff to take the baby off 
the ward and put her into intensive care. She died on November 11, 2009,
after both her lungs collapsed and she went into cardiac arrest.

Her mother Paula Stevenson, 40, who 
now lives in Australia, has told the inquest: ‘All along, the family had
expressed their concerns about Hayley’s breathing and had even asked if
there was a problem with her lungs, yet nothing was done.’

Hayley’s family have accused the hospital of ‘abominable’ failings in her care, which they described as ‘brutal’.

The inquest at Birmingham Coroner’s Court continues.
