A witness at media tycoon Alexander Lebedev's trial in Moscow today claimed that the businessman he punched on a TV programme appeared to be high on drugs and had provoked him.

German Sterligov, also a guest on the talk show, said that he too became upset at Sergei Polonsky and might have hit him had Lebedev not lashed out.

Lebedev faces up to five years in jail if convicted of politically-motivated hooliganism in a trial his supporters fear has overtones of media censorship.

Sterligov was one of the first millionaires after Communism crumbled and previously knew both Mr Lebedev and Mr Polonsky.

Asked if he was surprised 
construction tycoon Polonsky seemed 'high', he said: 'No - as far as I 
know it was quite a typical state for Polonsky.'

Questioned on what he meant by 'high', Sterligov said: 'I meant that he was under the influence of drugs.'

Asked if he was a specialist in 
understanding the influence of narcotics, he said: 'Sadly I had 
tragedies linked to moments when people went under the influence of 
drugs. 

'I am not an expert - but I can understand when a person is on drugs.'

Lebedev owns a Russian investigative 
newspaper and later bought the Independent titles and the London Evening
Standard, before handing control of his UK interests to his son amid 
fears he could be jailed. 

His supporters suspect powerful 
enemies are using his attack on Polonsky to seek to have him jailed in 
revenge for his anti-corruption campaigns. 

They point out Kremlin 
leader Vladimir Putin accused him of behaving like a hooligan. 

The hearing went ahead today as 
previously without Polonsky, who said he could not come to court because 
he was in Cambodia on strict bail conditions. Bizarrely, it now appears 
he is relaxing by the sea in Israel. 

Sterligov told the court that on the 
TV show - before Lebedev threw his punch - 'there was a moment when 
Polonsky got very close to me, very close and sort of reached towards me
with an offer to massage me'.

He stressed: 'Had he come a bit closer it would be me answering the court today, not Lebedev.'

Asked by Polonsky's lawyer if 
throwing punches was the right way to resolve a dispute, Sterligov - who
several years ago gave up business for a time to live like a tsarist 
peasant - said: 'The way I was brought up, I find it the most adequate 
answer one man can give another man when he was offended in such way.

'I find it a very soft way of stopping another man from not going further.

'Lebedev acted as a man that stopped in as soft as possible a manner a rude and offensive person.'

On the show, there were 'moments 
when Polonsky was constantly throwing his arms about - and he's got long
arms, so when he gesticulates his arms reached out almost to the faces 
of people sitting next to him. 

'At some point his arms were close to Lebedev's face. It was quite emotional.'

Judge Andrey Bakhvalov asked the witness if he was in friendly relations with Mr Lebedev. 

'No, if anything I've got a little 
grudge against him - but it won't influence my testimony. I have known 
Lebedev for some time.'

He added: 'He is quite a calm man - it is impossible for me to imagine him starting a conflict.

'Even when me and him had a conflict,
he sent complaints to the police. This is his way, to always act within
the legal boundaries. He is a person of a system.'

Backstage before the programme 
started Polonsky was saying 'how long should we stand people like 
Lebedev with his constant lies and tricks,' he said.

'I felt uncomfortable, I didn't like it. He was hopping around, he was interrupting people, he was running around.'

He told the judge there was no political element to the TV show or the dispute. 

The co-presenter of the show, Pavel Selin, also claimed Polonsky 'behaved provocatively'.

'Lebedev was calm enough until a certain moment and nothing predicted such behaviour,' he said.

Just before Lebedev's infamous attack
- which was seen worldwide on the web - Selin said Polonsky had told 
him to 'shut up' while swinging his hand towards the media owner. 

Polonsky also muttered about 'wanting to punch him in the face', he said.

'I thought it was offensive,' Sterligov said. He was 'invading Lebedev's personal space'.

Seconds before striking, Lebedev asked who he wanted to strike in the face, he told the court. 

He told the judge Lebedev did not 
talk about politics - a key point because he is accused of hooliganism 
based on political hatred. 

Today was the first time Lebedev had called witnesses. 

He was accompanied yesterday in court by his wife Elena Perminova, the Siberian-born model and fashion icon.

Prosecution witnesses included people
who had seen the two punches on TV. One was stopped randomly as she was
getting off a bus in Moscow and asked if she would testify.

The trial was adjourned until June 21
and Mr Lebedev was permitted by the judge to travel abroad to Britain,
France and Africa. 

Earlier he was banned from leaving Russia.
