A man died after getting stuck in a cavity wall with his mobile phone just inches from his grasp, an inquest heard.

Adrian Matthews, 30, was surveying the space between two walls in his home when he fell and got wedged in the tight gap.

He was so tightly stuck that he was unable to uncross his arms to reach his phone, which was pressed between his chest and the side of the building in Maidstone, Kent.

The inquest was told Adrian Matthews died after becoming wedged in a cavity wall and was only discovered after two days, the inquest at the Archbishops' Palace in Maidstone (pictured) was told

The cleaner’s body was only discovered two days later when Alan Sage, who owns the farm building, visited, the inquest at Archbishop’s Palace in Maidstone, Kent, heard.

He was asked to check on Mr Matthews by his son Joe, who was the last person to see Mr Matthews on August 27 at about 1.30am.

Detective Sergeant Neil Kimber, from Kent Police, told the inquest: 'I can only imagine he made a frenzied attempt to extricate himself from the hole.'

Coroner Patricia Harding delivered an open conclusion and recorded a cause of death was compression of the chest.

The hearing was told cannabis plants 
were growing in an adjacent room but Mrs Harding asked if Mr Matthews 
was trying to install an electric system to cultivate them.

DS Kimber said it was not possible to know with certainty if that was the case.

Mr Matthews' body was discovered in a hole cut into the floor of the room.

The cannabis plants were in a room on the lower floor.

Fire crews had to remove a wall so paramedics could reach Mr Matthews' body, the Kent Messenger reported.
