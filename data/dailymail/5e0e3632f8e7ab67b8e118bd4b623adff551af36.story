The highest court for the U.S. armed forces has agreed to hear the 
appeal of a Kansas airman convicted of assault for exposing multiple sex
 partners to HIV at swinger parties in Wichita, his attorney said 
Friday.

David Gutierrez was a sergeant serving at McConnell Air 
Force base in Kansas when he was sentenced in 2011 to eight years in 
prison and stripped of his rank in an aggravated assault case. 
Prosecutors told the trial judge that a stiff sentence would send a 
message that the military values the integrity of its service members, 
saying Gutierrez played Russian roulette with his sexual partners' 
lives.

Air Force Sgt. David Gutierrez, who was convicted of assault for exposing multiple sex partners to HIV at swinger parties in Wichita, Kan., has won an appeal to be heard by the highest court for the U.S. armed forces

The defense on appeal has won a rare opportunity to 
present before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces an 
argument that his attorney says could set a far-reaching precedent 
across the military.

'It will set the table for the entire 
military services as to what kind of evidence is necessary to find that 
someone can cause grievous bodily injury after testing positive for 
HIV,' said Kevin McDermott, one of his defense attorneys.

In 
addition to the HIV issue, the military appeals court agreed Tuesday to 
decide whether the evidence was sufficient to find Gutierrez committed 
adultery. The defense contends Gutierrez can't be guilty of adultery 
because his wife participated with her husband in the 'swinger's 
lifestyle.'

The appeals court, essentially the military 
equivalent of the U.S. Supreme Court, takes fewer than 5 percent of 
petitions submitted to it, McDermott said.

David Gutierrez was a sergeant serving at McConnell Air Force base in Kansas when he was sentenced in 2011 to eight years in prison and stripped of his rank in an aggravated assault case.

A military judge in 
Wichita found Gutierrez guilty in January 2011 on seven of eight counts 
of aggravated assault and of violating his commander's order to notify 
partners about his HIV status and use condoms. The judge also convicted 
Gutierrez of indecent acts for having sex in front of others and of 
eight counts of adultery.

Prosecutors did not immediately respond to an email Friday seeking comment.

The
 Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the conviction in March 
2013, and the defense appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
Armed Forces.

In its petition, the defense argued that the 
evidence was not sufficient to prove Gutierrez was HIV positive. The 
test used has since been recalled by the Food and Drug Administration 
because it was susceptible to false reactions.

His attorneys also
 said that even if Gutierrez had HIV, his medical records showed his 
viral load was so low during that time that he had a 'zero chance' of 
infecting anyone through oral sex and a 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 100,000 
chance of infecting a partner through unprotected intercourse.

'If
 the court agrees with us and determines David was not infected to the 
point that he could have caused grievous bodily injury to others, this 
would gut substantially 90 percent of the case against David,' McDermott
 said.

The case has not yet been set for oral arguments and no decision is expected until the summer of 2014.
