There was not a hairdryer in sight but there was plenty of hair standing on the backs of necks.

‘I went into a sort of trance listening to him,’ said Rory McIlroy, perhaps explaining what happened to certain referees at Old Trafford over the years.

McIlroy was speaking on the morning after the highlight of his Ryder Cup week so far, the presence in the European team room at Gleneagles of Britain’s finest-ever football manager, Sir Alex Ferguson.

The great man went into fine detail about how to deal with the mantle of favouritism, and how he made Old Trafford a fortress. ‘He talked about how when teams went there it was very hard for them to compete and how we’re slight favourites for a reason and we should embrace it,’ said McIlroy.

‘I was looking up at him and I couldn’t take my eyes off him. I’m just listening and thinking this is all the stuff he’s probably said to all the great Man United teams over the years.

‘He told us a couple of stories about his experience in big matches, and we got to ask him questions about what he thought was a key element to being successful as a team.

‘He’s just a very inspirational man when he talks. He’s got a lot of authority and the room just goes quiet and everyone listens.’

Not everyone was quite as rapt as the big United fan, of course. Not with fans of Liverpool, Arsenal, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich represented among the other 11 team members. ‘Believe me, they let it be known that not everyone in the room was a Manchester United fan,’ said McIlroy.

Real Madrid fan Sergio Garcia probably spoke for the rest. ‘Given who I support you’ll appreciate I’m probably not his biggest fan in the world, but I think when you have the chance to listen to somebody who has been up there in sports, it’s always interesting to pick their brain,’ he said. ‘He was fascinating and I think I speak for everyone when I say we’re glad we got to know him a little better.’

It wasn’t just the players Ferguson addressed. He had a little banter with the caddies as well. ‘As you can imagine, he enjoyed all that,’ said Europe captain Paul McGinley, who hatched the idea some months ago. ‘I was upstairs at the time having a rules meeting and even though it was one floor down and five rooms across, I could hear the laughter coming up. It went very well.’

Day two of official practice and plenty of pairings that will see service during the Ryder Cup itself were in action on both sides. Lee Westwood and Jamie Donaldson were in tandem, as were Thomas Bjorn and Stephen Gallacher. Graeme McDowell and Victor Dubuisson got another trial runout together, while Henrik Stenson played with Justin Rose.

It is what will happen with the other four players that is particularly interesting — McIlroy, Garcia, Ian Poulter and Martin Kaymer. All four will surely see action on the first morning but who will be paired with whom? Will McGinley take the high-profile option and go for McIlroy and Poulter, with the former playing with Kaymer in the foursomes after lunch?

Just as he has all week, McIlroy had a new driver in the bag yesterday and was quick to allay any fears that it represented a gamble.

‘This is a driver that I have been actually using and practising with since June, and I wouldn’t be putting it in the bag if I didn’t feel it was better,’ he said. ‘It’s the only driver I have been practising with, so I think that probably gives a clear idea of what is going to happen.’

As for the Americans, captain Tom Watson’s selections appear cast in stone. For the second day running he sent them out in the same order. You’ve got the A team of Keegan Bradley (left) and Phil Mickelson. Masters champion Bubba Watson will partner Webb Simpson and Rickie Fowler will team up with rookie Jimmy Walker.

Veteran Jim Furyk has been paired with another debutant, Patrick Reid. Zach Johnson and Hunter Mahan will see action together, as will Matt Kuchar and Jordan Spieth. To be fair to Watson, all make perfect sense, but it does lead to the question of where’s the Plan B if things are not going to plan.

The action unfolded on a sublime autumn day and was played out before a vast crowd. Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond turned up, looking none too bruised from last week’s experience.

What Salmond and the organisers would give for three days of such weather come tomorrow.

This particular course at Gleneagles might be far from a masterpiece but it is clear it is going to be a great Ryder Cup course, with fabulous viewing spots for spectators and sumptuous glimpses of the amazing scenery.

Only one day to go now, and Mickelson has raised the stakes deliciously with his tasty, barbed attack on McIlroy and Graeme McDowell, while poking fun at Europe’s supposedly superior team spirit.

All we need now to complete the scene is for Rory and Phil to be drawn to play against one another tomorrow morning.

Wouldn’t that set the Ryder Cup alight?
