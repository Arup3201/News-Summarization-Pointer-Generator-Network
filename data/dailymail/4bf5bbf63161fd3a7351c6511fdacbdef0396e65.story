Members of the New York Police Department have been caught editing the Wikipedia pages of police brutality victims.

Computers being used inside police headquarters at 1 Police Plaza changed the entries of Sean Bell, an unarmed man shot dead in 2006; Amadou Diallo, who was shot dead when police mistook his wallet for a gun in 1999; and Eric Garner, the Staten Island man killed last July in a police chokehold.

An individual also changed the entry for the British alternative Chumbawamba, swapping out three of the band's members with members of the police department.

Individuals inside police headquarters tried to edit the entries of Eric Garner (left) and Sean Bell (right with his fiance and daughter)

They also edited the entry of Amadou Diallo (above) was shot dead in 1999 when police mistook his wallet for a gun

These changes were all traced by Capital New York by following the public IP addresses. 

The Garner entry seems to have been edited the most, with numerous changes made on the page.

'Garner raised both his arms in the air' was edited to say 'Garner flailed his arms about as he spoke' and 'Use of the chokehold has been prohibited' became 'Use of the chokehold is legal, but has been prohibited.'

A sentence was also added to say that Garner was bigger than the officers on the scene.

As for Bell, who was shot dead on November 25, 2006 by undercover officers at his bachelor party the night before his wedding despite being unarmed, his entry was not only edited but there was also an attempt to have it removed completely.

On the Articles for deletion page, someone from the department wrote, 'He [Bell] was in the news for about two months, and now no one except Al Sharpton cares anymore. The police shoot people every day, and times with a lot more than 50 bullets. This incident is more news than notable.'

The entry was not removed. 

An individual also changed the entry for the British alternative Chumbawamba, swapping out three of the band's members with members of the police department

Information about NYPD Officer Kenneth Boss was changed on the page of Diallo, saying that the cop shot an 'armed' and not an 'unarmed' man in a previous incident.

None of the cops involved in any of these three incidents were found guilty of any charges.

'The matter is under internal review,' NYPD spokeswoman Det. Cheryl Crispin said about the edits.
