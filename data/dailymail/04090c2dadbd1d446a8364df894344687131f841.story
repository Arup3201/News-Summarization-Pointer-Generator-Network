Elizabeth Smart, who was kidnapped at the age of 14 from her bedroom at knife-point and held captive for nine months, is engaged to be married.

A spokeswoman for 24-year-old Smart revealed she got engaged last week and would be getting married in the summer.

Her future husband has not been officially identified, but has been reported to be a Scotsman named Matthew Gilmour.

Wedding gift registers at Pottery Barn and Williams-Sonoma list an entry for Elizabeth Smart and Matthew Gilmour in Utah on July 1, according to the Salt Lake Tribune.

'She has planned to be very public in
her child advocacy work but wants to keep the details of her personal 
life private,' spokesman Chris Thomas told the Deseret News.

Elizabeth's
father Ed Smart said his future son-in-law is a 'fine young man' and 
that he is very pleased for both of them with hopes they will have a 
happy life together.

Elizabeth said she was 'happy and excited for this next chapter in her life'.

The
pretty blonde, from Utah, hit headlines after she disappeared from her 
bedroom in 2002. Despite a nationwide search for the teen, she was not 
found for nine months.

It 
was only when an alert biker who had heard about her case on America's 
Most Wanted spotted her at a diner about 18 miles from her home.

In
the nine months she was held captive by one-time itinerant street 
preacher Brian David Mitchell and his wife Wanda Barzee, she was 
continuously raped and was even married to Mitchell in a bizarre 
ceremony.

He was convicted of kidnapping and sexual assault and was sentenced to serve life in prison in May 2011.

Wanda Barzee was sentenced to 15 years in a Texas federal prison hospital for her role in the kidnapping of the girl.

Last month she spoke for the first 
time publicly about what she suffered at the hands of Mitchell, 
revealing horrific details about her ordeal, including how he dragged 
her from her bedroom to a camp in the woods where he performed the 
marriage and then raped her.

She said: 'He went straight from marrying me to 
raping me. And after that moment I couldn't feel more worthless and more
degraded. It was the worse feeling I could have ever felt.'

'I kept begging him to let me go - and he wouldn't listen to me,' she told ABC.

'All I could do was scream ''No'. He said, ''If you ever scream like that again, I will kill you.'

Ordeal: Elizabeth Smart was abducted at knifepoint from her Salt Lake City home on June 5, 2002. She was held captive for nine months

Guilty: Brian David Mitchell was sentenced to life in prison for kidnapping and raping Elizabeth Smart after she was found alive on March 3, 2003

Accomplice: Wanda Barzee was charged with the kidnapping of Elizabeth Smart and sentenced to 15 years in jail

Although Miss Smart has published a 
book on her terrifying ordeal and spoken at the trial of Mitchell last 
year, this was the first time she was heard in public recounting the 
terrible details.

She had been invited to speak to members of the Salt Lake City Rotary Club to help promote her charity the Elizabeth Smart Foundation. It works in schools across the country with a programme radKIDS to educate children on how to protect themselves from danger.

The 24-year-old, who studies at Brigham Young University recalled being tied down with a cable on her first night and the deep sense of hopelessness that surrounded her.

She was held captive for nine months during which time she was raped daily by Mitchell, sometimes up to three or four times a day.

Miss Smart had testified at Mitchell's trial in 2010 in excruciating detail about waking up in the early hours of June 5, 2002, to the feel of a cold, jagged knife at her throat and being whisked away by the religious fanatic.

Within hours of the kidnapping, she 
testified, she was stripped of her favourite red pajamas, draped in 
white, religious robes and forced into a polygamous marriage with 
Mitchell.

She was tethered to a metal cable 
strung between two trees and subjected to near-daily rapes while being 
forced to use alcohol and drugs.

She described the horrific events as her 'nine months of hell.'

She recalled being forced to live 
homeless, dress in disguises and stay quiet or lie about her identity if
ever approached by strangers or police.

Daily, her life and those of her family members were threatened by Mitchell, she said at the trial.

Survivor: Elizabeth has openly spoken to various media outlets about her ordeal, in which she was repeatedly raped and held captive, in the hope she can help others who have suffered
