Amir Khan is considering setting aside his reluctance to box on Floyd Mayweather's undercard so he can seek revenge against the fighter whose drug-fuelled victory put the skids under his career for a couple of years.

Lamont Peterson, who was gifted a scandalous home-town decision over Khan, was found later to have been on steroids that dodgy night in Washington.

That revelation came as Peterson tested positive during the build up to their re-match.

Now, ironically, Peterson may be the man to offer Khan a route back to the top and perhaps even renewed hope of the mega-millions bout with Mayweather from which he has just been unceremoniously dumped.

That door has been opened by Peterson signing a management deal with Al Haymon, the secretive Svengali to a galaxy of star fighters, Mayweather among them.

Haymon works closely with Golden Boy Promotions, whose stable includes Khan and who also organise Mayweather’s big shows.

Even more significantly, now, Haymon is believed to be in talks with Khan about his future.

Khan remains hungry to avenge the Peterson robbery and the re-match would appear to be a natural at this point in time.

Bolton’s still-young, former two-time world champion is indicating that he will return to the ring on May 3 – the night he should have been fighting Mayweather in Las Vegas in the richest bout ever contested by a British boxer.

Mayweather suddenly switched to Marcos Maidana, then urged Khan to fight his protégé Adrien Broner on that bill to prove he deserves a September bout against the world’s best pound-for-pound boxer.

Not unnaturally, since one promise had been broken already, Khan was unconvinced. However, he explored the Broner possibility but then reported: ‘He doesn’t want the fight.’

The Peterson connection brings the option of an opponent Khan knows he is capable of beating, especially under conditions  of rigorous drug testing.

Khan says: ‘It looks like I will be back on May 3 and it might be a good idea to keep in Mayweather’s face as the chief support on his card. Don’t get me wrong, Floyd’s a great fighter. Probably the best of his era. But as he gets older he might need pressing to take on a younger, explosive fighter like me with real speed.’

Devon Alexander and Luis Collazo are among other candidates for Khan’s first fight in almost a year spent waiting on Mayweather. But Peterson is emerging as the favourite.

The light-welterweight belt which the IBF allowed him to keep despite the failed drugs test would not be on the line. Peterson would move up to welterweight, where Khan needs a convincing win to prove himself a worthy challenger for Mayweather’s title.

However, the history of controversy between Khan and Peterson would make for a fascinating box-office fight in its own right.

As promoter Frank Warren shrewdly manoeuvres either Tyson Fury or Dereck Chisora towards a big money shot at Wladimir Klitschko, the hottest of all the heavyweight prospects is closing fast on the next available world title.

Fury and Chisora are heading for a domestic collision this summer in a final eliminator for one of the younger Klitschko’s collection of belts.

Meanwhile Deontay Wilder, the American knock-out artist who has yet to be taken beyond the fourth round, has already become the challenger-in-waiting for the WBC crown, which has been left vacant by Vitali Klitschko as he fights the far greater battle for the future of Ukraine.

Wilder stepped yet more heavily on the gas on Saturday with a first-round flattening of Malik Scott, to take his professional record to 31 straight KOs.

That positions the Bronze Bomber from Alabama to take on the winner of the up-coming WBC title fight between Bermane Stiverne and Chris Arreola, of whom he says: ‘I could knock both those two out on the same night.’

Rematch: Fury will be looking for a repeat of his points victory over Chisora in London three years ago

Warren, who had been contemplating one more warm-up fight each for Fury and Chisora next month, is now fast-tracking them to their WBO eliminator.

Big Wlad, who has a routine defence of all his titles in April, might then be pinned down to fight the winning Brit before the end of the year.

Should either Chisora or Fury prove capable of ending Klitschko’s seemingly ever-lasting run as multiple champion that should set up, in turn, a unification mega-bout with Wilder next spring.

Wilder appears open to that proposition. Remembering his quick stoppage of Audley Harrison in Sheffield last year, he says:  ‘I would be happy to cross the Atlantic again. Not only do I know I would beat either of them but I love going to England.’

He spices the prospect further by adding: ‘As for Fury, he’s a joke of a heavyweight.’ Careful, Deontay.

A cavalier traveller Fury may be but he is even bigger than you and punches almost as hard.

And, by the way, the reborn Chisora is a more dedicated, determined and dangerous fighter than the reluctant heavyweight who was knocked out by David Haye.

Kid Galahad was born Abdul Barry Awad but changed his moniker to that of the boxer played by Elvis Presley in a movie.

On Saturday, in his home town of Sheffield, the Kid has the chance to start making a name for himself.

Galahad takes on former Spanish champion Sergio Prado at the Ponds Forge Arena in a bid to become the European super-bantamweight champion.

He does so 20 years on from the night Prince Naseem Hamed won that same title, in the same arena, and he says: ’I’m looking to do an even better job than Naz did on Vicenzo Belcastro. 

‘That means I will have to be unbelievably good and take this guy apart.’

If he can deliver a performance of that quality, the Kid will propel himself towards Scott Quigg and Carl Frampton in the echelon of British world title contenders at super-bantamweight.
