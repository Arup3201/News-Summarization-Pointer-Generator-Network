This enormous pentagram etched into the ground next to a lake in an isolated corner of Kazakhstan, has had conspiracy theorists all of a flutter after it appeared on Google Earth.

The five-pointed star symbol which measures some 366 metres in 
diameter, is situated on the southern shore of the Upper Tobol Reservoir
 in the north of the country.

Pentagrams are commonly associated with devil-worship, but are also used in the Bahai religion and Chinese Taoism as well as neopaganists and followers of the Greek mathematician Pythagoras.

Work of the devil? The Kazakhstan pentagram pictured on Google Earth, is situated next to a reservoir in the north of the country

Location: The strange symbol is situated 12 miles west of the town of Lisakovsk

But quite what the symbol, which is visible on Google Earth here, is doing in such a remote location remains a mystery.

While some have jumped to the conclusion that it is obviously the work of a secretive satanic cult, others believe it could be the remains of a Russian military base.

The symbol, consisting of a five-pointed star inside one or two circles, is often associated with satanism

One internet user, Kurt Yates, from Seattle, Washington, posted on the Live Science website: 'It's probably an abandoned surface to air missile site.

'I was a military pilot and these things are all over the place in areas that use(d) Russian (Soviet) air defense systems.

'The shape has something to do with how their tracking radars work.

'Considering the size of it and the proximity to the Baikonur Cosmodrome, I'd say it possibly was used for tracking Soyuz rockets or some such.'

The satanic link is further strengthened by the fact the spot has been highlighted on Googlemaps by two users called 'Adam' and 'Lucifer', both of which are names associated with the devil.

The pentagram was used as a Christian symbol in ancient times to represent the five senses and to symbolise the five wounds of Christ. It was also believe to protect against demons.

Neopagans, such as wiccans, use it as a symbol of faith similar to the Jewish Star of David. The circle is said to represent unity and protection.

Satanist pentagrams, are commonly drawn with two points up and the head of a goat inside and are referred to as the Sigil of Baphomet.

They are associated with fallen angels and are used as a sign of rebellion or religious identification.

The three downward points are supposed to represent the rejection of Trinity.

Military link? One theory is that the pentangle is the remains of a Russian tracking station used to monitor Soyuz rockets
