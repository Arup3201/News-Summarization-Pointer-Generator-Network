The Māoris explained the presence of almost perfectly spherical boulders on Koekohe Beach, on the South island of New Zealand, as eel baskets washed up from an enormous, sunken canoe.

But the science behind the unusual rocks is much stranger.

The Moeraki Boulders, measuring up to three metres in diameter, were in fact formed from ancient sea sediments around 60 million years ago.

It is thought the stones were created by the cementation of Paleocene mudstone and were then buried in the mudstone cliffs

Found on new Zealand's Otago coast in isolation as well as clusters, the formations have been exposed through shoreline erosion from the coastal cliffs that frame the beach.

Experts say the unusual rocks are the result of erosion, time and concretion - when a compact mass of sedimentary rock is formed by the precipitation of natural mineral cement within the spaces between sediment grains.

It is thought the boulders date from the 
Paleocene epoch making them at least 56 million years old.

It is thought the stones were created by the hardening of Paleocene mudstone which was then buried in the mudstone cliffs, according to Kuriositas.

The relentless pounding of waves over millennia has gradually eroded the softer stone and uncovered the compacted spherical stones.

As the boulders were formed by concretion, they are more resistant to the weathering effects of the elements and so their shape is preserved while the softer mudstone is eroded.

The spherical boulders began forming in marine mud (that later became mudstone) of the Paleocene sea floor, while the cracks, known as septaria formed slightly later

The spherical boulders began forming in marine mud (that later became mudstone) of the Paleocene sea floor.

This theory was proven when studies of the boulders' composition showed their magnesium and iron content as well as stable isotopes of oxygen and carbon.

Scientists believe they are spherical as their source of carbon was mass diffusion and rocks two metre in diametre 'grew' over a five million year period, when up to 50 metres of marine mud settled on top of them.

Some of the boulders measure three metres in diameter. Rocks measuring two metres in diametre 'grew' over a five million year period, when up to 50 metres of marine mud settled on top of them

Some of the rocks have strange cracks (pictured), which are known as septaria. The cracks were filled with small amounts of dolomite and quartz as well as brown and yellow calcite, which gives the boulders their distinctive appearance

The cracks were filled with small amounts of dolomite and quartz as well as brown and yellow calcite, which gives the boulders their distinctive appearance.

This happened when the sea level fell and allowed groundwater to flow through the mudstone surrounding the boulders.

Unusually for rocks, the centre of the concretion can be relatively weak, whereas the outer layers are the hardest part as they are composed of up to 20 per cent calcite.
