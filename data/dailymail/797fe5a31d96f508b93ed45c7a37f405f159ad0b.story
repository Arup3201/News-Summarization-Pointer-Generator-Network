A nine-year-old girl who witnessed her mother being viciously assaulted wrote a letter to Santa asking for the assailant to be put ‘on the naughty list’.

The girl’s mother, Christine Beckwith, appears to have been attacked simply for parking her car badly while she took her daughter and five-month old twins to see a holiday light display.

The assault took place when Ms Beckwith returned to her car on Sunday night in Lake Mary, Florida with her children.

Attack: Christine Beckwith was assaulted over her crooked parking and was left with a black eye

Another car pulled up alongside her and the driver began shouting at her about the way she’d parked.

The mother explained that she would move the car once she’d secured her kids in the back seat, but the woman who was yelling, described as Hispanic, jumped out and launched an astonishing assault, with the help of her friends.

Ms Beckwith told Click Orlando: ‘The one [woman] had grabbed me and pushed me down to the trunk of her car and held me while the other girl punched me in the face and scratched my face and pulled my hair out.’

The whole incident was witnessed by Ms Beckwith’s daughter, who screamed uncontrollably throughout.

According to Ms Beckwith, she yelled: ‘don't touch my mommy. Leave her alone, stop it, stop it you need to stop touching her’.

Her little girl then decided that punishment should be meted out by Father Christmas and penned a letter to him asking that justice be served.

She wrote: ‘Dear Santa, Today my mom, Christine, got physically hurt by a woman. I want you to put her on the naughty list! She had long black curly hair, no tattoos, black shirt, jeans, and cruddy attitude!!!’

Ms Beckwith, who was left with a black eye, added that she feared if her attacker could strike again, since she had no scruples about assaulting someone with three children.

The suspects drove away from the scene in two cars, with the friends of the attacker covering her license plate with a rag.

One of the cars was a Honda Civic with a Christmas wreath on the front, thought to belong to the attacker.

According to Click Orlando, the attacker is described as having long, dark, curly hair, being in her early 20s, about 5 feet 4 and weighing 140 pounds.
