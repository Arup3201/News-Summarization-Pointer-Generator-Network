She has built a career on being the funny one with the rounder figure.

These days she is a little less rounder, however. According to Star magazine, Melissa McCarthy has shed about 45 pounds.

'She's been making small changes and seeing big results,' a friend told the weekly. 'It's given her a real confidence boost.'

The 44-year-old Heat actress has shed the weight by cutting back on pasta and bread.

'She has been on a high protein, low carb diet,' said the insider.

But the cousin of Playboy model Jenny McCarthy is not about to go overboard when it comes to dieting.

'Melissa knows that fans love her big and beautiful, and she's not obsessed with dieting,' said the source. 'She's looking for a happy medium.'

What motivated the Tammy star to shed the pounds was not the pressure Hollywood puts on her.

Rather, she just wanted to live longer. 

'Melissa realized she wasn't being as healthy as she could be,' said the friend. 'She wants to set a good example for her kids and she wants to be around to become a grandmother too.'

The actress, who shot to mega fame with the 2011 hit Bridesmaids, has children Georgette, aged four, and Vivian, aged seven, with actor Ben Falcone, who she wed in 2005.

Star's source claimed the beauty used to weigh 265 pounds and now is at 220 pounds. 

Over the summer, the Gilmore Girls star told People she has a 'good sense of self-worth' which she has 'grown into.'

Yet, she's not totally unaffected when she's the target of negativity.

The actress revealed she's had to deal with some nasty comments, ranging from her acting ability to her size.

'I've never felt like I needed to change,' she said. 'I've always thought, "If you want somebody different, pick somebody else."

'But sure, criticism can sometimes still get to me. Some things are so malicious, they knock the wind out of you.'

The star also hopes her daughters grow up knowing that looks aren't everything and it's what's on the inside that counts.

Melissa has had a successful run and there seems to be no sign of her slowing down any time soon.

She is currently filming B.O.O.: Bureau of Otherworldly Operations which is slated for release in 2015, along with her other film Spy.

The star is also said to be returning to the silver screen with The Heat 2.
