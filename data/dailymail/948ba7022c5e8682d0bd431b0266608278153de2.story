A terminally-ill cancer patient has decided to spend the rest of his life helping others.

Simon Mitchell, of Blackpool, drew up a bucket list to assist others achieve their dreams after he was diagnosed with lymphoma, a cancer of the blood, which has left him with only two years to live.

The 41-year-old former PR man now uses the contacts and expertise he built up through his old career to arrange meetings between seriously ill children and their idols

The wishes he has already granted 
include meeting Katie Price and the Stig, and arranging exotic holidays 
for injured soldiers.

One of those who have had their dream come true is 17-year-old Daniel Wilkinson, of Bingley, West Yorkshire, who has between one and five years left to live because of a brain tumour.

Simon arranged for him to meet his idols, Top Gear presenters including Richard Hammond and the Stig, after he was contacted with Daniel’s story by brain tumour charity Andrea’s Gift.

Simon said: 'I got in touch with one of the producers and they arranged for him to go to their track near Guildford.

'He went three times around with the Stig and met Richard, Jeremy, and James, who all chatted with him.”

Simon, who is married to Kerrie, 28, said: 'If I manage this list and I die with a smile on my face, with 
people remembering me and with my wife proud of me, then it will all 
have been worth it.

'It might all make my condition worse but it’s a chance I’m willing to take.

'I’ll only stop when my body tells me to stop.'

The former PR man was forced to quit his job with phone 
company Orange following his diagnosis, but now uses his contacts and 
expertise in his bid to help others.

Star turn: Simon has enlisted the help of Katie Price, who met with cancer sufferer Gabriella Davidson after he got in touch

He has in fact built up a 
relationship with former glamour model Katie Price, who agreed to meet fan and 
cancer-sufferer Gabriella Davidson, four, at a book signing.

Top of his bucket list however is to help 60 injured soldiers - something he has already started with the help of Lancashire-based charity, A Ray of Sunshine.

The organisation has a villa near Cadiz, Spain, which is free for deserving people.

Simon worked with the charity to arrange special trips abroad for soldiers Terry Mair, of Blackpool, and Steven Robinson, of Leyland, Lancashire, and their families.

The charity arranged the holidays while Simon used his PR contacts to get free flights, car hire, entertainment and petrol.

Former SAS man Terry, 44, who was left wheelchair-bound after being wrongly diagnosed with a nervous disorder, said: “The holiday was just fantastic.

'It was great to get away and forget about a few things. I can’t thank Simon or A Ray Of Sunshine enough.

'I think he is an outstanding man, it is nice there are people out there like him.'

Simon said: 'A lot of the general public forget that we’re still at war and some armed forces personnel are forgotten about when they return to the UK.

'Families can only be supportive so far, my aim is to try to make them forget, if only for a few days, what’s happened to them.'

Simon is also working with forces charity 
Band of Brothers by arranging holidays, concert visits, and celebrity 
meet-ups for 30 soldiers a year.

He has raised £60,000 for seven charities since 2010 and even completed a 200ft bungee-jump only weeks after chemotherapy.

'It was just three weeks after I completed a course of chemo,' he said.

'I was sick. My wife shouted at me. But I know it was only because she cares.'

Simon, who had half of his right lung removed soon after diagnosis, wants to raise a total of £100,000 for charity before he dies, through acts such as a sponsored climb of Europe’s highest mountain, Mont Blanc, and driving to the North Pole.

He said: 'How many people have climbed Mont Blanc with half of their right lung removed? I’m sure I have the strength in me to do it.'

Challenge: Mont Blanc, Chamonix, which Simon aims to climb despite having half of his right lung removed

Prime Minister David Cameron, who praised Simon after he helped capture a robber armed with a knife

Amazingly, Simon has also won praise from David Cameron - after he helped capture a knife-wielding robber just a few months after diagnosis.

He bravely pursued a knifeman after spotting him threaten a woman and then guided police to his location.

Simon said: 'He was a bit quicker than me because of my treatment but I could still run.

'Being diagnosed with a terminal illness takes the fear away from situations like that.

'The Prime Minister wrote to commend me for my bravery.'

Amy Wolsthenholme, a two-year-old meningitis victim who lost a leg to the disease, enjoyed a holiday in Spain thanks to Simon.

He helped organise the villa through A Ray Of Sunshine and also sorted out flights - including a seat in the cockpit.

Simon said his own wish was a simple one - 'to live'.

He said: 'I want to be able to buy myself enough time for more research into the treatment of my illness.

'If I were to survive it I’d start a charitable foundation of my own.'
