Stoke City manager Mark Hughes accused Joel Ward of making 'the best save of the match' after being denied a clear penalty during in Saturday's 2-1 home defeat against Crystal Palace.

Hughes was left feeling aggrieved after two big decisions failed to go his side's way having taken a 14th minute lead through Mame Biram Diouf.

Asmir Begovic was controversially penalised for a challenge on Yanick Bolasie to allow Palace to level from the spot after 41 minutes. And then after Wilfried Zaha had put the visitors ahead, Diouf's goalbound shot in the second half was blocked two-handed by Ward with the Palace getting way with it.

'That decision left us scratching our heads,' said Hughes. 'Referee Andre Marriner missed a lot of things. I know Julian Speroni did well in the Palace goal but arguably that was the best save of the match. He has got two hands on it for heaven's sake. How he doesn't give it, I've no idea.'

It rubbed salt into the wound for Hughes who had earlier seen Palace awarded their penalty.

'When you see the replay, the lad Bolasie has got his foot up high above Amsir. That has why Asmir has missed the ball and the referee has deemed it a penalty. It was a key moment, that is one you want them (the officials) to get.'

Even so, Hughes didn't have any excuses for Palace's winning goal from Wilfried Zaha on the stroke of half-time from Glenn Murray's flick-on.

'It was a mistake from us. It was just a long ball, if you don't clear the first ball, you have to deal with the second ball. We didn't and that is what cost us. We are better than that.'

Stoke slipped to ninth while Palace are now 11 points above the bottom three and Alan Pardew is above his former club Newcastle United in the table.

'It was a cracking game particularly if you were a neutral or a Palace fan,' said Pardew.

'I think Stoke were unhappy about our penalty. I haven't seen it back but it was a turning point.'

Zaha was all smiles after his winner after being told to stop his 'little sulks' by Pardew earlier last week.

'He had a tough game, Erik Pieters was a player we tried to sign, he is an aggressive defender. Wilf struggled but he has his moments and we showed a lot of character to have a go.

'It was a tough day for the officials. All of it was fair, but it was a tough physical encounter. It was almost like a Six Nations game at times, in a tough way.'
