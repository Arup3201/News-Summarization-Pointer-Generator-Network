Kell Brook could face British rival Amir Khan as soon as February after making a faster than expected recovery from a stab wound sustained on holiday in Tenerife and being given the all-clear by doctors.

Promoter Eddie Hearn has revealed doctors have told Brook he can fight again with dates being looked at as early as February and March - raising hopes of a domestic welterweight showdown.

Brook won the IBF version of the crown from Shawn Porter and was set to make his first defence in December before the stabbing incident earlier this month.

But the horrifying incident in Spain has changed the Brook camp's priorities, with Hearn saying they could try to secure a clash with Khan as soon as they can.   

'We can push for [the Khan fight] straight off the bat in the spring,' Hearn told the Toe 2 Toe podcast. 'I think it's a makeable fight and of course it's one that everyone wants to see.' 

Hearn has marvelled at the speed of Brook's recovery from what could have been a career-ending injury. 

Hearn told Sky Sports News: '(It was) a horrific injury, I've seen the damage it's done to his leg - it's one wound but it's bad enough.

'Unbelievably he's been given the all-clear from the doctors in terms of fighting again - no damage to ligaments, no damage to tendons, just muscle damage which will be repaired in time.

'He's a fast healer, and he'll need to be. I think he'll be three or four weeks in a sort of semi-cast and then back on the rehabilitation.

'But we're already looking at dates for February, early March next year. So not too much disruption bearing in mind the injury that he received.'

Brook is now back at his home in Sheffield after arriving from Spain on Wednesday night.
