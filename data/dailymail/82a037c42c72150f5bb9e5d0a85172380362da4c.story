A young Harry Potter aficionado believes she's the wizard's biggest fan thanks to her vast collection of memorabilia worth a staggering £40,000.

Katie Aiani, from Simi Valley, in California, USA, has dedicated the last 16 years of her life to the wizardly world of Harry Potter.

The 26-year-old, who works as a graphic designer, first became obsessed with the J.K. Rowling books after her sister recommended them to her when she was just 11.

A wizardly fan! Katie Aiani is so obsessed with Harry Potter that she's spent thousands of pounds on trips to film premieres and theme parks, and has rooms piled high with magical memorabilia

And she has been hooked ever since - spending thousands of pounds on trips to film premieres and theme parks, and has rooms piled high with magical memorabilia.

The self-proclaimed 'world's biggest fan' boasts an impressive collection, which includes wands, broomsticks, her very own set of Gryffindor robes and character figurines.

She also has replica props from the movies, cast autographs and a one-of-a-kind banner from the world premiere of the final film installment, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part Two, in London in 2011, which she claims is worth more than £3,000.

Katie said: 'My Harry Potter obsession began when I overheard the words 'Alas! Earwax'.

Is there anything she doesn't have? The superfan's collection includes wands, broomsticks and her very own set of Gryffindor robes and character figurines

'My dad read the first book to my younger sister and at first I teased her for choosing to read such a silly sounding book.

'But she demanded that I read it, so I decided to give it a go and I finished it in one night. I picked up the second and third books straight away.

'I got so drawn in by the story and the magic that I was so upset when I found out the fourth book hadn't been published yet.

'From there I attended the midnight book release parties, then the midnight movie release parties and conventions. And I travelled to film locations, Quidditch matches, world movie premieres, Potter fan events - everything you could possibly think of.'

She's amassed quite the collection! Katie's friends and family buy items for her every year for holidays and special occasions

But, despite the value of her mammoth collection topping more than $70,000 (£40,000), Potter-mad Katie has no plans to sell any of her prized hoard.

She said: 'The first item that I ever collected were these original plastic Harry Potter character set of figurines that my dad bought for me.

'And my first movie related item was a huge double sided Philosopher's Stone poster that I received from the local cinema where we had been for the midnight showing.

'I began collecting everything, and my friends and family have bought items for me every year for holidays and special occasions. My collection is priceless to me and will never be for sale.

Inking: And, in true super-fan style, Katie also had the message tattooed on her arm, which reads 'Keep fighting! You're inspirational. With Love & admiration -Jo'

Are you hiding Daniel Radcliffe under the bed? Katie has also rubbed shoulders with some of the stars of the blockbuster movie franchise, including Emma Watson, Rupert Grint and Julie Walters

'While some girls out there buy shoes, or expensive clothes and make-up, I am perfectly happy buying Harry Potter memorabilia instead.'

The obsessive fan even met her idol J.K. Rowling and treasures a handwritten letter she received from the author - which is estimated to be worth around £7,000 alone.
