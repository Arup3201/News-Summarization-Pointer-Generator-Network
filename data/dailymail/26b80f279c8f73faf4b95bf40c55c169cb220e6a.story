A taxpayer-funded website which allows drug dealers to get illegal substances tested for quality has provoked a backlash.

The service called Wedinos (Welsh Emerging Drugs and Identification of Novel Substances Project) was set up to enable health professionals and police to check the ingredients of suspect pills and powders.

It also offers people advice on how to start taking drugs and safeguards to consider when getting high.

Controversial: Users can submit drugs to Wedinos for testing, in complete anonymity, then log on to the site to see the quality of their drugs

The site, paid for by Public Health Wales, has now been launched 
nationally in an attempt to combat  health fears sparked by the 
explosion in the number of so-called legal highs.

But
 it has sparked anger from politicians who have accused it of diverting much-needed cash from frontline NHS services and also providing a
 de facto kitemark of quality which would be exploited by drug dealers 
as a 'marketing tool' to boost their profits.

Substances sent anonymously to Wedinos
 are analysed to identify their active ingredients, which are listed on 
the website alongside a photo of the substance and the packaging it came
 in.

Conservative
 health spokesman in the Welsh Assembly Darren Miller told Radio 4's 
Today programme: 'It’s not just legal highs that this website allows 
people to test. It’s also illegal drugs as well.

'It’s
 clearly open to abuse by drugs pushers who can use this, because it’s 
in the public domain, as a marketing tool to publicly advertise the 
purity of their substances and therefore increase their prices.

Analysis: Included on the substances listed on the website was a fruit pastille coated in LSD - which came back positive for the hallucinogen

'If you go on to the website, you’ll find there are brand names on there, there’s packaging on there, and it’s heroin, crack, methamphetamine, all these sorts of substances that people are sending in to be tested. And it includes even advice on how to snort, inject and smoke those substances.

Wedinos aims to reduce harm to drug-users by providing rapid information about substances on the streets.

A total of 175 samples have been received and tested by Wedinos project.

The project cost £103,000 to set up and has a budget of £90,500 a year - less than 1 per cent of the overall substance misuse budget.

Of the samples sent to the project, 84 per cent were new psychoactive substances (NPS), of which 16 per cent were synthetic cannabinoids and 31 per cent amphetamine-like stimulants.

A spokesman for the project said: 'Wedinos does not test for purity of a sample, and therefore cannot provide any information as to the relative "cleanliness" of a drug.

'What the system does do is enable individuals who have purchased substances believing them to be legal to ascertain the true content. 

'Of the samples collected to date, bought as legal highs, 27 per cent were found to contain controlled drugs.'

'I think it’s quite clear that the Welsh Labour government have given up the fight against drugs. That’s why they’ve established this website.

'When it’s costing hundreds of thousands of pounds, I would rather see that cash reinvested back into the frontline NHS services that are in crisis at the moment here in Wales.'

Included on the substances listed on the website was a fruit pastille coated in the hallucinogen LSD.

The sample came back positive for Lysergic acid diethylamide, or LSD.

The project, which cost £103,000 to set up and has a budget of £90,500 a year, has also raised questions about the dangers posed by sending drugs via the mail system.

Users are warned on the website: 'The mail system prohibits the posting of controlled drugs and narcotics. Do not knowingly submit samples of controlled drugs via the postal mechanism.'

Recent years have seen increasing amounts of new substances entering the UK drug market, manufactured in labs abroad to mimic the effects of known narcotics while sidestepping the law by changing their precise chemical make-up.

The unfamiliarity of the substances involved has introduced new risks, as users and health workers can be caught out by unexpected and damaging side-effects.

Josie Smith of Public Health Wales 
told Today: 'Essentially, the Wedinos project was established as a 
consequence of a call from clinicians within emergency departments, 
ambulance and other health services, along with the criminal justice 
service, where they were being presented with individuals who had taken 
substances but were unaware of what they were.

'The clinician would be unaware of what the substance was. They didn’t know how to treat.

'Over
 the last few years, we’ve seen a real sea-change in the drugs market. 
We refer to the term "new psychoactive substances" because the term 
"legal highs" can denote a degree of safety, and actually we are finding
 that there are a number of adverse effects that people are 
experiencing.'

Taking drugs: The publicly-funded Wedinos website offers advice for people who are thinking about starting to take drugs

Ms Smith added: 'We do not specify purity
 of substances, what we do is test a sample that has been submitted and 
explicitly name all of the substances that are contained within it. It’s
 not a purity measure.'

Ms Smith said 52 per cent of the samples sent to Wedinos were bought as legal highs, but 27 per cent of those actually contained illegal substances.

Evidence from across the UK showed that, even within a single batch of substances brought into the country from China or India, the actual chemical make-up can vary widely.
