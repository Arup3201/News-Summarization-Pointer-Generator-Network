Arsenal's new Colombian goalkeeper David Ospina has been ruled out for three months, with an injury he picked up while playing for former club Nice.

Arsene Wenger confirmed the keeper's injury at his press conference before Arsenal take on Anderlecht in Belgium on Wednesday night.

Emiliano Martinez is set to make his Champions League debut, and the 22-year-old Argentine is now the only senior cover for the suspended Wojciech Szczesny.

David Ospina has been ruled out for three months after aggravating an old injury in his last outing for Arsenal

Arsene Wenger blamed the problem on the player being rushed back from injury while at his former club Nice

David Ospina joins the Arsenal injury list which also includes...

Mesut Ozil, Olivier Giroud, Mathieu Debuchy,  Yaya Sanogo, Mikel Arteta and Laurent Koscielny, while Aaron Ramsey, Theo Walcott, Serge Gnabry and Jack Wilshere are all still struggling for fitness.

Wenger claims the injury is the result of being rushed back from a different problem while in France. 

‘He had his first injury in Nice,' claimed the Arsenal boss. 'It was a knee problem and I think he was a bit rushed back. 

'He didn't use his legs so his muscle became weaker, then he got injured during the World Cup. And after that he came to us injured, from the World Cup. 

'It took him two months to play a game. I had to bring him on against Galatasaray without warm-up, without being prepared and he had a recurrence of that injury.

Arsene Wenger has had to call up young keepers Ryan Huddart, Josh Vickers, Matt Macey. Read more about Wenger's young keepers here.

'That means he is out for two to three months. Now we have to be really careful because he has a recurrence of a thigh injury that's very difficult. It's a long-term injury.’ 

However, despite the injury crisis at the club, Wenger claims he feels younger than ever and just as motivated to win the Champions League on the eve of his 65th birthday as Arsenal take on Anderlecht tomorrow.

The Arsenal manager, who is in his 17th consecutive year of Champions League football with Arsenal, has never won the trophy,

But Wenger says that he has no plans to stop despite hitting pensionable age. ‘Do I feel young?’ said Wenger. ‘No, my age is my age. You have to believe in that.

Arsenal were given a boost ahead of Wednesday's match as midfielder Aaron Ramsey was able to train

'Until now I am lucky to be in shape. But the desire and motivation is stronger than ever. I am so keen to do well with my team this season. 

'Hopefully we can do it, I feel there is huge potential there. I want the club and the team to do as well as they can, it’s my dream, I want to give absolutely everything for my team to do it.

Arsenal's English stars were all smiles on the train to Belgium ahead of their Champions League tie 

Theo Walcott also took part in training as he steps up his return from nine months out after a knee injury

‘I am not a celebrator of birthdays. I just think what is important tomorrow is my team performs well. It is big game for us and I will dedicate all my energy to get things right and perform. 

'There is a difference between quality of our performances and points we gave. We want to add something to quality of our performance, that we feel is there in the team.’
