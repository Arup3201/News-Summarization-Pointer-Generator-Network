MSNBC caused a media stir after announcing Kim Kardashian's decision to accept Kayne West's marriage proposal using footage of a woman falling face first onto train tracks.

During a report this morning about a woman who sleepwalked off a subway platform, MSNBC accidentally put up the caption, 'Kimye Engaged'.

Punters questioned whether the premature headline was really an accident, while media outlets described the gaffe as 'one of the more disturbing cable news images in recent history' and a 'chyron fail'.

Kimye Engaged! Social media users are questioning whether MSNBC deliberately overlaid the playful caption about the celebrity engagement on footage of a dangerous fall

The News Now reported the 31-year-old woman was sleeping on a bench on a platform at Red Line T at Davis Square Station in Boston when she started sleepwalking.

The woman fell face first onto the train tracks, narrowly missing the third electric rail which was live.

Passersby helped the woman before a train arrived.

A Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) spokesman said she was never in danger of being hit because a train wasn't nearby.

The woman was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital where she was treated for an injury to her lower left arm.Â
