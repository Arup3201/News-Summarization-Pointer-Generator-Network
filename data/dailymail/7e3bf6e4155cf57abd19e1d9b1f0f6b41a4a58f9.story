It took 12 minutes before a section of Newcastle’s fans started their weekly invitation to Alan Pardew to seek alternative employment. How much leeway, if any, can be bought with a point at the Liberty Stadium remains to be seen.

Certainly, the prognosis looks better, a draw coming against a backdrop of 19 points taken from the previous 26 games.

More than that, there was the evidence here of a fighting spirit, manifested in the goals of Senegal’s Papiss Cisse, who twice pulled Newcastle level in a game they often looked like losing but, ultimately, might have won.

So that is progress and, most likely, a stay of execution for a manager who could desperately use some popularity points. Not that you would know it, with his frostiness towards elements of the media continuing after the game.

‘The players will be more confident coming out of the game than they were coming in,’ Pardew said, with extra praise reserved for recalled striker Cisse, who had his first start of the season and took his tally to four goals.

‘Papiss had a tough season [in 2013-14] with a lot of injuries and Loic Remy took his place. He looks like the rest has done him good. The first finish was brilliant and the second was instinct. He is in a good place at the moment.’

Not everyone at the club, particularly Pardew, can say that.

Swansea manager Garry Monk has certainly been in a better mood than he was after this match. His side gave away the lead on two occasions, after Wilfried Bony and Wayne Routledge had scored. He was also unhappy with the refereeing of Lee Mason. He said: ‘It is two points dropped for us. The goals we conceded were poor. A lack of concentration really has cost us dearly.

‘After the second goal, possession became too easy for Newcastle. In those situations you have to learn to keep your concentration, don’t get sloppy. We should have won by a couple of goals.’

The refereeing, in particular, agitated him, coming days after he complained that sides are allowed to get away with too much by disrupting his passing side with fouls.

‘I don’t know what else I can say,’ Monk said. ‘It has gone unheard. They had 10, 13, 14 fouls before anything [a yellow card] happened.’

For Pardew, there was the vindication of a brave selection succeeding. He dropped two summer signings in Remy Cabella and Emmanuel Riviere, who cost a combined £18 million and have, as yet, failed to deliver. In came Gabriel Obertan and Cisse and they played well for the team.

For a time, theirs was the only contribution worth cheering. Indeed, the game was less than 10 minutes old when owner Mike Ashley was the subject of frustrated fans’ attention with a chant of ‘you fat Cockney b******, get out of our club’. Supporters then dished out similar treatment to Pardew a couple of minutes later. By then, Cheick Tiote had already played a pass straight into touch.

‘Pardew for England,’ sang the Swansea fans. It can be a cruel game sometimes. For Pardew, that extended to going one down just moments after Newcastle’s first promising attack.

Obertan had fired wide in the 17th minute following some impressive pressing, but in the very next phase Swansea were ahead after a white blur of one-touch passing.

Ki Sung-yueng played through the middle, Bony laid off for Gylfi Sigurdsson and the Iceland forward’s pass was perfect. Bony went through and scored his first of the season, a staggering statistic in light of his 25 goals last time round. Newcastle would have been two down in the 38th minute had it not been for goalkeeper Tim Krul’s agility. Routledge had out-paced Daryl Janmaat on the left and play switched to Nathan Dyer on the right. There was a solid argument to be made for either of Swansea’s wingers to get an England call earlier in the week and Dyer strengthened it by darting past Paul Dummett.

Dyer’s low cross was met on the volley by Bony, but Krul reacted swiftly to tip the shot wide.

Against such Swansea momentum, Newcastle levelled two minutes before half-time. Poetically, it was the two men Pardew drafted in who did the damage.

Obertan found space on the right and hit a low cross to the near post. Cisse got away from Ashley Williams and glanced a finish across keeper Lukasz Fabianski. It was Newcastle’s first away goal in 763 minutes.

Did it inspire a significant improvement? Jack Colback kicked straight into touch from the kick-off and within five minutes Swansea were ahead again.

Jonjo Shelvey, who has been called up by England, took possession on the left and squared to Sigurdsson. The forward held off a weak challenge from Moussa Sissoko and slotted a pass to Routledge, whose chipped goal was delightful.

Krul then denied Bony, his save perhaps even better than that in the first half, and once more it was followed by a Cisse equaliser.

Sammy Ameobi, on as a substitute, made it with a 75th-minute cross from the right and Cisse found space between Jazz Richards and Williams to poke the ball over the line.

It was a poor goal to concede, but it was a blessing for Pardew.
