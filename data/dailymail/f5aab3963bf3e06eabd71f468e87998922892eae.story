Thailand's political crisis has deepened after its embattled prime minister announced she will dissolve parliament in a surprise televised address.

Yingluck Shinawatra 
appeared emotional and her voice shook in an emergency broadcast after 100,000 anti-government protesters took to the streets of Bangkok for a 'final showdown'.

At least five people have been killed and 289 injured in the latest wave of unrest in Thailand, which has been plagued by turmoil since an army coup in 2006.

Crisis: 100,000 protesters have taken to the streets of Bangkok today to call for the government to end

Protesters waving flags, blowing whistles and shouting anti-government slogans today have blocked the streets and 60 schools have been closed as a precaution.

Some have occupied the Finance Ministry and part of a vast government complex for more than a week. There were fears today's protests could end violently when nine groups of demonstrators converge on the prime minister's office.

During the broadcast, she said there would be new elections 'as soon as possible, adding: 'After listening to opinions from all sides, I have decided to request a royal decree to dissolve Parliament.'

But the move may not halt the country's political stand-off, which deepened yesterday after the main opposition party resigned en masse.

Protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban has repeatedly said calling fresh elections would not be enough to end the conflict.

Suthep, a former deputy prime minister under the previous military-backed government, said the announcement would not stop the march.

'We have not yet reached our goal. The dissolving of parliament is not our aim,' he said.

The protest leader was equally defiant yesterday, saying: 'We will rise up. We will walk on every street in the country. We will not be going home again.'

Thailand has been plagued by political turmoil since the army toppled Yingluck's brother Thaksin in a 2006 coup.

The former leader now lives in self-imposed exile in Dubai to avoid jail 
time for a corruption conviction which he says was politically motivated.

The Thai elite and the educated middle-class have pitted themselves against Thaksin's power base in the countryside, which benefited from populist policies designed to win over the rural poor.

The crisis boiled over last month after 
Yingluck's ruling party tried to push through a controversial amnesty bill, which critics said was designed to return Thaksin to power.

The violence had only a brief respite last week when both sides paused to celebrate the birthday of the nation's revered king, who turned 86 on Thursday.

Today's announcement concerns the 
500-member lower house of parliament, where all 153 representatives of 
the opposition Democrat party have resigned.

Party
leader Abhisit Vejjajiva claimed the government had become 
'illegitimate', adding: 'The solution to our current problems needs to 
start with the showing of responsibility. The prime minister has never 
showed any responsibility or conscience.'

Yingluck's government came to power in a landslide vote in 2011 that observers said was free and fair.

In a speech yesterday, Yingluck said again that she was not trying to cling to power and would be 'happy to resign' if new elections are organised within 60 days and all parties accept the outcome.

Suthep has repeatedly rejected those initiatives and refused to negotiate, it has been reported.
