Paleontologists have discovered a family of triceratops, including one of the most complete skeletons ever found.

The bones were uncovered on a ranch near Newcastle, Wyoming, by a team from the South Dakota-based Black Hills Institute of Geological Research and the Naturalis Biodiversity Center from the Netherlands.

They believe the rare find of skeletons belonged either a to a parent group of triceratops or two females and a youngster.

The three-horned dinosaurs lived more than 65million years ago and were often meals for predators, such as Tyrannosaurus Rex, which left behind only their skulls for dinosaur trophy hunters to find.

Paleontologists also discovered the left foot and left leg of a T-Rex, which roamed the same area.

It is believed the three Triceratops were attacked by a T-Rex.

Black Hills Institute president Pete Larson said he was excited when he first saw the T-Rex foot, but he soon realized the potential presented by the Triceratops bones.

'We have been given a rare, I would say unprecedented, opportunity,' Larson told AP.

The dig will continue for about four weeks as Larson while his 25-person team excavate the site.

Tyrannosaurus
Rex used its fiercely strong jaw and neck muscles to literally rip the 
head off Triceratops after killing the huge armoured creatures, a new 
theory claims.Research
into Triceratops fossils from the U.S. shows that the Jurassic apex 
predator first slew its prey, then wrenched off its head in order to get
to nutrient-rich neck meat hidden by body armour.Tyrannosaurus
was well known to feed on the Triceratops but until now few have 
questioned how it got around the herbivore's tough neck frill.

He said the fossils will provide a more 
complete example of the Triceratops, which in mass was about the size of
an elephant and stood more than 7ft tall.

Mr Larson said: 'If you could imagine a person, 6ft 
tall, inside the stomach of one of these adult Triceratops, they 
couldn't reach each side of the rib cage,' Larson said.

The Houston Museum of Natural Science in Texas currently houses a Triceratops that has about 75 per cent of its skeleton - believed to be the most complete find to date.

Mr Larson told Rapid City Journal that this skeleton only needs to be 50 per cent complete to be among the four most complete skeletons to be found.

Mr Larson said few Triceratops skeletons have ever been discovered, so the new find could provide a lot of information.

He said the family group is an 'unprecedented' find.

'We have the opportunity to really rewrite the book on Triceratops,' he told Rapid City Journal. 

After the fossils are prepared and mounted into a display, they could be sent to the Naturalis gallery, he said.
