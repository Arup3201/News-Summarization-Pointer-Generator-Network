A woman who traveled 2,000 miles across the country in order to surprise her pregnant sister with a visit just hours before her baby shower has released a video diary of her plan, which also captures the pair's incredibly emotional reunion.

Erica Pounds, 22, from Los Angeles, California, and her brother-in-law Perry Johnson, 28, who lives with his wife Felicia in Conway, Arkansas, spent more than a month hatching their plan together in order to ensure pregnant Felicia had the most memorable baby shower ever.

'The idea came from Erica and I, while I was texting her about the upcoming shower and what would make it special,' Perry, whose wife has since given birth to a beautiful baby boy, Perry Jr., told Daily Mail Online.

Sisterly bond: Felicia, 28, was overjoyed when she discovered her younger sibling hiding a large cardboard box on her doorstep, and promptly broke down in tears

'She originally was not able to make it but found a way to get off from work to be there in Conway which is almost 2,000 miles away.

'We spent about a month and a half planning it.'

The video, which begins shortly after Perry has picked his sister-in-law up at the airport, charts every moment of the duo's heartwarming plan, including the additional minutes that they had to wait while Felicia made an impromptu trip to the shops.

'Baby doll, you have no idea what's going on, but it's about to go down,' Perry says to the camera.

'You're about to get a special delivery package - and guess who's in it?'

He later adds: 'This is the one day that [Felicia] decides she wants to take some extra time and go to the store and go shopping before our surprise. 

'She's ruining our surprise because now we have to wait on Felicia. We love you any way though.' 

All of that effort most definitely paid off however; the shock and surprise on Felicia's face when she opened the box in which her sister was hiding quickly turned to tears of  joy as she pulled her sister into a tight embrace, sobbing into her shoulder.

The best present ever: Erica and Felicia share an incredibly close bond

And, action! The whole experience was captured on camera by Felicia's husband Perry

'I couldn't believe it,' she admitted to Daily Mail Online. 'It felt surreal and thought I was dreaming. It was the most incredible surprise that has ever happened to me.'

The 28-year-old, who gave birth to her four-month-old son Perry Jr. shortly after her baby shower, added that, despite the physical distance between them, she and her sister have always had an incredibly close bond - one which has only been strengthened by the birth of her first child.

'We are very close; she is my best friend and we have been through many ups and downs in our lives,' the new mother added. 

'She is one of my confidants and I am very thankful that she is my son’s aunt.' 

Both sisters admit that the surprise would likely never have happened without the help of Felicia's devoted husband Perry, who helped to engineer the whole plan right from the start - and also ensured the entire experience was captured on camera so that the family can relive the memory time and time again.

'[Seeing the video] immediately took me back and it was great to see how much work had gone into this,' Felicia said. 

'It really made me appreciate how much work and again, brought back that surreal feeling because this happened to me/ My husband, Perry and my sister Erica, planned it perfectly and it’s tough to keep anything from me. She got me good on that one.'

Perry, who is a singer and a musician - and actually met his wife while auditioning for the X Factor - and Felicia sing in a band together, and he thought it would add even more meaning to the video if he had one of their tracks playing throughout the clip.

'The song is a Fresh Play original called Our Love from our debut album called Unveiled,' he explained. 

'I was on American Idol Season 10 and later met my wife on the singing competition called The X-Factor.

'It was pretty much love at first sight.'
