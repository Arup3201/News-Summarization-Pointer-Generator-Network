The two young men at the head of a Philadelphia prep-school drug ring have turned on each other after authorities raided their operation - confiscating pounds of drugs, several weapons and $11,000 in cash.

Neil Scott, 25, and his 18-year-old associate Timothy Brooks were arrested as the ringleaders of the 'Main Line Takeover Project' - a drug dealership in suburban Pennsylvania which dealt exclusively in colleges and high schools.

While the two once worked closely together to run their illicit business, they have since turned on each other as they 
face multiple felony charges.

After the two were arraigned in Montgomery County Court on Monday, their lawyers issued statements defending their clients.

Greg Pagano, the attorney for Brooks, told ABC News that his client was only involved in the ring for three months, did not posses any of the weapons and was 'remorseful' for his behavior.

'He suffered an injury as an athlete at his first year of college in the Fall of 2013 requiring him to come home for surgery and to recuperate,' Pagano said.

'He became depressed and was not well physically or mentally. It was during this time period that he became acquainted with the wrong people.'

Scott's lawyer Timothy Egan paints a different portrait of Brooks however, saying he was a drug dealer before meeting Scott and the only one who worked directly with the high-school dealers.

'Mr. Scott had no direct relationships with any high school students or any high school drug dealers with regards to any substance - including marijuana,' Egan said. 'The main contact he had with the high school was Mr. Brooks ... and Mr. Brooks already had per-existing ties in at least a few of the high schools.'

Scott remains in jail on $1million bail while Brooks is free after his parents posted his $250,000 bail.

Both are facing multiple felony  counts including working for a corrupt organization, conspiracy, and possession of a controlled substance.

Scott and Neil are graduates of the Haverford School, a $35,000-a-year prep school where they played lacrosse and went on to supply drugs.

Good upbringing: Both Scott and Brooks the posh attended Haverford College. A private, nonsectarian, preparatory boys' school outside Philadelphia

Scott 
graduated in 2008 and went to Connecticut College, but he dropped out 
after three semesters when he was caught smoking pot and making fake 
IDs, the Philadelphia Daily News reported.

Afterwards,
 one of his high school coaches found him a job working for a team in 
California, and when that folded in February 2013, another coach in the 
state gave him a job on his program.

'He told me there was nothing good at 
home,' the coach, Zack Burke, told the Daily News. 'Nothing but drugs and trouble, and he wanted to get 
away from it out here.'

But Burke said that Scott's attitude 
began to change. He added that 
he thought Scott began dating a 40-year-old dermatologist who could provide him Xanax and other pills.

'I feel like she made him crazy,' he said. 'I heard he packed up his car and went back to Philly in September.'

Likewise,
 Brooks headed back to Philadelphia for surgery after suffering a sports
 injury after one semester - and he met with Brooks, a fellow Haverford 
grad who he knew through lacrosse circles.

The pair allegedly bought books about street-smart drug dealers to learn the business.

Prosecutors say they then hired 
students to peddle the drugs at Lafayette, Gettysburg and Haverford 
colleges, and at several suburban high schools.

The two named their network 'The Main Line Takeover Project,' investigators said.

'Their
 intention, as the name suggests, was the two of them would take over 
drug distribution - in particular, marijuana distribution - in schools 
and colleges on the Main Line,' District Attorney Risa Vetri Ferman 
said.

'This was not a game. 
These people were in business, they were in business to make money and 
they were going to do whatever they needed to do so that no one 
threatened their business.'

Scott would receive bulk shipments from a California supplier which would be shipped to his Haverford apartment, which allegedly served as his base of operations.

Ferman said local students would be drafted into the drug distribution operation as sub-dealers to allegedly distribute cocaine, marijuana, hash oil and ecstasy.

'The high school sub-dealers were encouraged to develop their business so they could sell at least one pound of marijuana each week,' Ferman said.

Brooks - who Ferman said acted as the supervisor of the student dealers - instructed them to make sure there was 'never a drought,' Ferman said. He wanted dealers to make certain there was always a constant supply in the assigned schools.

If the dealers met their weekly quota, the incentives included a lower purchase price for marijuana in order to increase their profit margin.

Ferman said investigators learned about the 'Main Line Take Over Project' through confidential informants and conducted a one-day round-up in February.

In that operation, prosecutors said they confiscated 8 lbs. of marijuana, 3 grams of hash oil, 23 grams of cocaine, 11 grams of Ecstasy, $11,000 in cash, a loaded handgun, an AR-15 assault rifle and AR-15 style rifle.

Most of the contraband came from Scott's Haverford apartment, authorities said.

Questions: As well as the two ringleaders, Garrett Johnson, 18, (left) and Daniel Mcgrath, 18, (right) were arrested in the investigation. They are both students at Scott and Brooks' former prep school

'Sub-dealers': Willow Orr, (left), and Domenic Curcio, 29 (right) were also arrested in connection with the ring

'Involved': Reid Cohen, 18, (left) a high school student, and John Rosemann, 20, (right) a Lafayette student

Investigators found approximately 
eight pounds of marijuana, three pounds of hash oil, 23 grams of 
cocaine, 11 grams of ecstasy, $11,000 in cash, a loaded AR-15 assault 
rifle, a loaded 9mm pistol, and a loaded .22 AR-15 style rifle along 
with ammunition for all of those guns.

During
 the four-month investigation, text messages revealed Scott gave Brooks 
advice on how to expand the marijuana sales in high schools, 
investigators say. Brooks then supervised sub-dealers who sold marijuana
 at local high schools.

Ferman says the two men exploited those relationships to help build their drug operation.

In addition to Scott and Brooks, seven alleged 'sub-dealers' were also charged. They are: Daniel McGrath, 18, a student at The Haverford School; John Rosemann, 20, a student at Lafayette College; Christian Euler, 23, a graduate of The Haverford School and student at Lafayette College; Garrett Johnson, 18, a student at Haverford College; Reid Cohen, 18, a Haverford College student; Willow Orr, 22; Domenic Curcio, 29.

Two juveniles, a 17-year-old Radnor High School student and 17-year-old Lower Merion High School student, have also been petitioned by the DA's office.

Lafayette College senior Christian 'Stocky' Euler, a star lacrosse player who attended Haverford with the two ringleaders, was also involved and turned himself into police last Tuesday.
