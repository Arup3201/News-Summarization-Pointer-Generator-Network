This is the suit designed to keep British medics free from Ebola, as they head for parts of west Africa ravaged by the disease.

The first wave of NHS volunteers were deployed by the Government this weekend. They were sent to Sierra Leone to join the global effort to control the epidemic.

The group of 30 volunteers is made up of GPs, nurses, psychiatrists and emergency medicine consultants.

After arriving in Sierra Leone's captital, Freetown, they will complete a week of training before moving to British-built Ebola treatment centres across the virus-ravaged nation.

There, they will help diagnose and treat those who have fallen victim to Ebola, which has killed more than 5,000 people - the majority in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea.

In their fight against the deadly disease, the health workers have been kitted out with special protective suits, made by four British companies.

The suits leave no part of a healthcare workers body exposed, providing a crucial barrier designed to keep them safe. 

The outfits include white overalls coated with a special plastic, which stops bodily fluids including blood, vomit and diarrhoea - which all carry the virus - from passing through the protective layer.

The mouth and eyes - two areas most vulnerable to potential transmission - are covered by a mask and visor. 

Each healthcare worker will wear two pairs of gloves, the outer pair acting as an extra seal. 

While the suit provides high levels of protection against Ebola, the volunteers have been warned they must be careful when putting the suit on and taking it off.

Removing the protective gear in the right order is essential for reducing the risk of contracting the disease.

Once removed, the majority of the kit is burned, and replaced to further reduce the risk of transmission.  

The visor and boots are sprayed with chlorine to kill any trace of the virus.

Working in a difficult environment where temperatures soar to more than 30°C, the NHS workers will only work for 45-minute sessions, to prevent heat exhaustion.

Each medic's name, role and the time they entered their ward will be written on their aprons to ensure they don't exceed the set time limit.

The importance of protective clothing was highlighted when a doctor treating a Spanish nurse who contracted the virus published an open letter saying his staff was ill-equipped for the job.

Dr Juan Manuel Parra claimed the suit he was given to treat Maria Teresa Romero Ramos left his arms exposed as the sleeves were too short for him.

Doctors who initially treated her were not properly equipped either he said, wearing only impermeable gowns, double gloves, a hat and a face mask. 

More teams of volunteers are set to leave the UK in the coming weeks after hundreds came forward to offer their services.

They have been preparing for deployment with intensive training at a Ministry of Defence facility in York.

Most of the volunteers said they put themselves forward for humanitarian reasons.

One of those leaving for Sierra Leone, Dr Hannah Ryan, 29, from the intensive care unit at Aintree University Hospital: 'I guess there are many reasons I volunteered for this; I am interested in infectious disease medicine, I have always wanted to do humanitarian work, I wanted to take on the challenge of working in this complex environment.

Prepared: NHS staff will undergo a week's intensive training after arriving in Sierra Leone tomorrow. More teams of volunteers are set to leave in the coming weeks after hundreds came forward to offer their services

'But mainly I found myself less and less able to hear about the evolving situation in west Africa and the increasing loss of life and do nothing. I felt I just had to go.

'The first aim of this operation is simply to get well-trained staff there to open more treatment centre beds and see more patients, and do it safely. 

'I hope more NHS staff, particularly nurses and laboratory staff, will hear about this and be encouraged to volunteer.'

Dr Mark Willcox, 26, a GP from the Wirral, said: 'I am in a position to go and help. I was greatly assisted by the Royal College of Surgeons, Dublin in getting a medical education so it's a privilege to give something back. 

'We have received superb training by the UK military, who really should be recognised for their outstanding efforts in this crisis.

'My GP practice has been hugely supportive of me going which has been fantastic.'

Dr James Lavers, 37, an intensive care registrar from Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor, said: 'I decided to volunteer for the Ebola response in Sierra Leone because this could be the biggest medical disaster of my lifetime, killing hundreds of thousands of people in the region. 

'To prevent this from happening and save vast numbers of lives, large-scale intervention has to happen now.' 

Committed: Within a week, British volunteers will be treating patients with the deadly Ebola virus in west Africa. They have been preparing with intensive training at a Ministry of Defence facility in York

Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies said: 'I have been really impressed with the numbers of NHS workers who have stepped forward to help the communities that have been devastated by Ebola.

'The fact more than 1,000 have come forward so far is a real testament to their commitment to public service.

'I want to offer my thanks to all those that are going, their efforts will make a real difference in West Africa.'

Previously the Department of Health has said British workers sent to fight the outbreak will not automatically be brought back to the UK for treatment if they become infected.

If they catch the virus, a decision to repatriate the patient will be made on a 'case by case' basis, depending on whether it is in the patient's medical interest to return.
