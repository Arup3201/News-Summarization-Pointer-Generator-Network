Florida authorities said Monday that a man who was arrested on three counts of second-degree murder hung his wife from a cord, then beat and shot her.

Andy Avalos, 33, is accused of killing his wife, a neighbor and a church pastor.

Authorities in Bradenton said the 4-year-old son of Andy and Amber Avalos was at home when the slayings occurred.

The 33-year-old Avalos was arrested Saturday at a mobile home park in Bradenton.

Officials say he killed his wife and a neighbor, Denise Potter, at his home Thursday.

Officials say Avalos then went to the church where his wife worked.

He first spoke with Joy Battle, the church pastor's wife, who is the office secretary.

Battle said Avalos 'was rambling on about how the world was evil,' according to the report.

Avalos was believed to have developed a strong paranoia about his relationship and had begun suspecting every man that walked pass his wife 

Detectives were called to Bayshore Baptist Church on Thursday where they found the body of Mr Battle sparking a manhunt for Avalos

Battle's husband, Pastor James 'Tripp' Battle, approached the office and that's when Avalos shot him in the courtyard, the arrest report said. Battle's wife saw him fall to the ground.

The motive for the shootings is unclear, said Manatee Sheriff's officials.

Assistant State Attorney Art Brown said during Avalos' first appearance in court on Sunday that Avalos admitted to killing the three people.

Brown said Monday that his office will review the charges filed by the Sheriff's office.

'The facts will be reviewed by us and we will be making a determination to the appropriate degree of the offense,' Brown said, adding that if the office feels there is enough evidence, the charges could change to first-degree murder, which would have to be presented to a grand jury.

Avalos is being held in the Manatee County Jail without bond and has requested a public defender.

The victims leave behind a total of 10 children; the Avaloses have six children, Potter had two and the Battles also had two.

The pastor is believed to have counselled the suspect while he was having problems with his marriage.

Mr Battle's father Jimmy told the Tampa Bay Times that he believed Avalos was paranoid and began suspecting every man that walked pass his wife.

Sheriff Brad Steube said Battle and Avalos met face-to-face in the church courtyard shortly before the shooting.

'The pastor saw this coming, they were facing each other' he told the newspaper.

Leslie Howell, who had been renting the home out to the family for the last three years, said she had vague suspicions the couple were having problems because of the poor condition of the home.

Killed: Police also found the body of 45-year-old Denise Potter, who lived next to the suspect and his wife

One of Amber Avalos' sisters, who lived in the same home with her three children, arrived at the scene shortly after police.

She said the couple had been together for more than 20 years but suggested Avalos had substance abuse problems.

She said: 'He's crazy, he's psychotic. He takes drugs and he drinks a lot.'

Patrick Duff, her partner, said that Mrs Avalos had left her husband a couple of months before but he had returned home.

Judy Smith, a friend of the family, told the Sarasota Herald Tribune that Alavos loved his children but was 'sick' and had a lot of problems.

As news of the deaths broke, the devastated church community tried to unite and support the families of the victims.

'We have to be strong for Joy,' church member Linda Stewart told the Bradenton Herald. 'I don't know how she will get through this.'

E.W 'Karp' Carpenter, a member of the church since the 1950s, told the newspaper that Battle 'was a great pastor,' and that the church's congregation grew from 30 to more than 100 under his stewardship.

'He was 31 years old and would give you shirt off his back,' Carpenter said.
