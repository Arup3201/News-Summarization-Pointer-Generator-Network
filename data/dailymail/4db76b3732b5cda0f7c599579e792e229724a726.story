An unsettling video of toddler being encouraged to smoke has incited an uproar on the Internet.

Wide-eyed and padded with puppy fat, the youngster, who can be no older than two, nervously holds the lit cigarette as adults out of shot whisper encouragement.

A couple of times he tries to give it back, but they will not take it. Then they are perversely effusive in their exhortations as he puts it to his lips, although he appears not to inhale.

Shocking: This toddler stands wide-eyed and innocent as he's encouraged to smoke a cigarette

Perverse: Although he has no idea what to do with the cigarette, the adults looking after him egg him on

Unsettling: Their cries of encouragement increase in intensity as he brings the lit cigarette to his lips

The footage was uploaded to the LiveLeak video-sharing website by a user from Macedonia. Its origins are unknown, but it is believed to have been filmed in eastern Europe or Russia.

Throughout the two-minute-long clip the adults looking after the boy, as well as at least one older child, can be heard cackling at the toddler's confusion.

It has been shot in a run-down living room, devoid of distinguishing features.

Despite the youngster not knowing what to do with the burning cigarette, and his repeated attempts to give it back, they insist he hang on to it until it has nearly burned down to his fingers.

Baby see baby do: The young boy makes a face as he mimics the actions he's seen older people repeat

Innocent: He tries to return the cigarette but is encouraged to hold on to it despite his unwillingness

Persistence: He flicks the ash into the ashtray. He's forced to keep it until it's burned nearly to his fingers

Commenters on LiveLeak, where they didn't try to make quips, were condemnatory: 'This is just too disgusting to watch,' wrote one upset viewer.

'An innocent kid who does not know any better, and can only imitate and follow instruction from the people he trusts most ... humanity has failed again..

Another opined: 'Some f***** up people in this world. You need a license to own a dog but any pr*** can have kids. Sad times we live in.'
