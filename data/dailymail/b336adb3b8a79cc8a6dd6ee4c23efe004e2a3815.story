Samsung has approached BlackBerry  
about buying the company for as much as $7.5 billion.

The Korean giant hoped to
gain access to its patent portfolio, according to a person
familiar with the matter and documents seen by Reuters.

The move could mean that BlackBerry's poorly performing handsets could be scrapped or integrated into Samsung's Galaxy line.

The Korean giant hoped to gain access to its patent portfolio, according to a personfamiliar with the matter and documents seen by Reuters.

South Korea's Samsung proposed an initial price range of
$13.35 to $15.49 per share, which represents a premium of 38
percent to 60 percent over BlackBerry's current trading price,
the source said.

Executives from the two companies, which are working with
advisers, met last week to discuss a potential transaction, the
source said, asking not to be identified because the
conversations are private.

Shares of Blackberry jumped as much as 30 percent on heavy
volume in afternoon trading in New York.

The offer price would imply an enterprise value of $6
billion to $7.5 billion for BlackBerry, assuming conversion of
$1.25 billion of convertible debt, according to the documents.

BlackBerry announced a high-profile security partnership
with Samsung in November. 

The partnership will wed BlackBerry's
security platform with the South Korean company's own security
software for its Galaxy devices.

Representatives for BlackBerry declined to comment while
Samsung could not be immediately reached for comment.

Last month the ailing firm launched the Blackberry Classic, a handset based on its hugely successful Bold phone.

It hopes 'loyal customers' - who include Kim Kardashian and Barack Obama, will save the firm following disastrous sales of its touchscreen handsets. 

BlackBerry CEO John Chen introduces the company's new phone, the BlackBerry Classic, during a news conference in New York.

Pioneered in 1999 with the launch of the RIM 950, BlackBerry changed the culture by allowing on-the-go business people to access email wirelessly. 

Then came a new generation of competing smartphones, and suddenly the BlackBerry looked ancient. 

Apple showed that phones can handle much more than email and phone calls. Blackberry was late in overhauling its operating system to compete.

BlackBerry now holds a small fraction of the U.S. smartphone market after commanding a nearly 50 percent share as recently as 2009. 

Instead of apps, cameras and screens, the $450 Classic focuses on keyboard, security and battery life 

With the Classic, BlackBerry is courting its core customer, the business user. 

The physical keyboard is something traditional BlackBerry users prefer because they find it easier than touch screens to type with. The company is also emphasizing battery life and security.

'A lot of people say the Classic is aiming for loyal customers. And that is true,' CEO John Chen said at the gadget's launch event, tellingly held in New York City's Financial District. But he also invited people who haven't used a BlackBerry 'especially people who are young,' to try the BlackBerry Classic.

The handsets have a legion of loyal fans.  

'I love a BlackBerry,' Kardashian West admitted to the Code Mobile conference earlier this year. 

'Every time I say that, people are horrified that I have a BlackBerry, and I don't understand that reaction.' 

'BlackBerry has my heart and soul, I'll never get rid of it,' she said.

 'I do have an iPhone, and I use that for photos, but if you have an email and you need to type fast, you need to have that keyboard.' 

The BlackBerry Classic is available for sale starting Wednesday for $449 in the U.S. and 499 Canadian dollars in Canada through Amazon.com and BlackBerry.com. It will come later to AT&T and Verizon.

Despite the endorsement, speaking at the APEC CEO summit in Beijing, BlackBerry CEO John Chen said he was not interested in hiring the reality TV star.

'I'm not into bringing celebrities on board,' Chen said. 

'It's not that it's a waste of money but a question of where you should spend the money today.'

The company is trying to stay relevant on making hardware even as it tries to transform into an enterprise security and consumer software company. 

Whether the Classic will sell enough to keep it in the hardware business is unclear.

'It's going to be a niche product based around enterprise, based around security and pockets of the world where there is still strengths. 

The future of this company is not the hardware,' BGC analyst Colin Gillis said.

The BlackBerry Classic is available for sale starting Wednesday for $449 in the U.S. and 499 Canadian dollars in Canada through Amazon.com and BlackBerry.com. It will come later to AT&T and Verizon.

BlackBerry has been expanding its efforts to sell mobile-security software on its rivals' smartphones and tablets to help counter the waning popularity of its own devices.

And on the hardware side, BlackBerry partnered with Foxconn, the Taiwanese company that assembles products in vast factories in China. 

Foxconn, known for its manufacturing contract work on Apple's iPhones and iPads, jointly designs and manufactures most BlackBerry devices and manages inventory of the devices in an agreement that offloads much of BlackBerry's manufacturing costs. 

Foxconn is making the Classic for BlackBerry.

Chen, who took over as chief executive 13 months ago, has set a goal of selling 10 million phones a year. 

In comparison, Apple sold 39.3 million iPhones over three months in the third quarter.
