A Royal Navy 'floating hospital' with 100 beds and a state-of-the-art casualty unit has begun loading supplies as part of Britain's bid to halt the Ebola outbreak.

RFA Argus arrived today in Falmouth, Cornwall, where it is set to spend six days before sailing for Sierra Leone with 750 servicemen and three Merlin helicopters.

The ship's arrival came as the death toll from Ebola passed 4,000 and the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned its spread to Europe was 'unavoidable' following the diagnosis of a Spanish nurse.

Floating hospital: Navy ship RFA Argus arrived today in Falmouth, Cornwall, to prepare for its deployment to west Africa next week. The ship has 100 beds including some on high-dependency and critical care units

Loading up: Crew members receiving medical supplies to deliver aboard the ship. Today the WHO said the spread of the disease in Europe was 'unavoidable' after the diagnosis of Spanish nurse Teresa Romero

Critical: Crew members aboard the 18,000-tonne ship received boxes labelled 'urgent medical supplies'

Crew members received boxes labelled 'urgent medical supplies' today as the 18,000-tonne Royal Fleet Auxilliary ship prepared to deliver vital equipment as part of Operation Gritrock.

The 574ft floating hospital, which carries 80 personnel, can be 'uniquely tailored to deliver cutting-edge treatment afloat' according to the Ministry of Defence.

It has more than 40 medical and surgical specialities and is manned by crew members from the MOD's hospital units and Royal Marine Band Service.

Its facilities include a full emergency department, resuscitation and surgical facilities, a radiology suite with a CT scanner, a critical care unit, a high dependency unit and a 70-bed general ward. 

Once the ship is off the coast of west Africa, personnel will help train doctors and nurses as well as running treatment centres, with 200 military staff set to run a WHO-led training centre.

Base: The ship will also support three helicopters as they move people and supplies to hard-to-reach areas

Preparations: Crew members in Falmouth today. Liberia has been by far the worst-affected country in the disease's deadliest ever outbreak, with 2,316 deaths compared to 930 in Sierra Leone and 778 in Guinea

The government says the training is vital - as among the 4,000-plus people who have died of Ebola, more than 230 have been doctors and nurses struggling to treat people with the disease.

The ship will also be a forward base for the three Merlin helicopters, whose aircrew and engineers from 820 Naval Air Squadron will ensure 'the rapid movement of key personnel to areas where they are required', a Navy spokesman said. 

Troops, meanwhile, will help build a treatment centre in Sierra Leone's Kerry Town to help meet the British government's target of providing 700 new beds in the region. 

A spokesman said: 'This package will further support the country’s stretched public health services in containing the disease by helping up to nearly 8,800 patients over a 6-month period.' 

Liberia has been by far the worst-affected country in the outbreak, with 2,316 deaths compared to 930 in Sierra Leone and 778 in Guinea.

The number of deaths dwarfs the previous most deadly outbreak, which killed 280 people in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1976. 

Precaution: A funeral yesterday near Sierra Leone's capital Freetown. Many people contracted the disease by handling bodies of loved ones, and more than 230 of the 4,000-plus deaths have been of health workers

Unstoppable: Health authorities have warned it could be difficult to halt the disease if it is not contained soon

Today the WHO said the spread of the disease in Europe was 'unavoidable' after the diagnosis of Spanish nurse Teresa Romero.

She became the first European to contract the disease outside west Africa after coming into contact with 75-year-old Spanish missionary Miguel Pajares, who was flown home for treatment and later died.

'Such imported cases and similar events as have happened in Spain will happen also in the future, most likely,' said WHO's European director Zsuzsanna Jakab.

'It is quite unavoidable... that such incidents will happen in the future because of the extensive travel both from Europe to the affected countries and the other way around.'  

Defence secretary Michael Fallon said it was vital that Britain helped the international fight against the disease.

The current outbreak, the deadliest since the virus (pictured) emerged in 1976, has killed about half its victims

'The Ebola outbreak in west Africa is already a global threat to public health and it’s vital that the UK remains at the forefront of responding to the epidemic,' he said after a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee.

'We are stepping up significantly the UK's contribution and leadership in work to tackle the outbreak on land, in the air and at sea.

'At the heart of the package is the commitment to provide more than 750 personnel to help with the establishment of Ebola treatment centres and an Ebola training academy.

'We are deploying troops, helicopters and a ship – army medics and Merlin helicopters supported by RFA Argus – to provide direct support and reassurance.
