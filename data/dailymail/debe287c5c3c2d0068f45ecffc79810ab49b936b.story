Charged: Eyal Alima has been charged with drunken driving after getting his car stuck on the front lawn of a Chicago police station

A 47-year-old man has been charged with drunken driving after getting his car stuck on the front lawn of a Chicago police station.

Police said Eyal Alima arrived at Northbrook Police Department about 10pm Saturday to file a report, but his car got bogged on the front lawn after he missed the turn for a public parking bay.

While Alima insists it was simply a 'misunderstanding', police say he registered a blood alcohol level reading above the legal driving limit of 0.08.

'The building is pretty well-lit outside,' police spokesman Daniel Petka told Chicago Tribune. 

'I think it'd be hard to get confused.'

Petka said that Alima missed the public parking lot and drove into the employee section before circling the building.

But instead of exiting onto Landwehr Road, he allegedly turned and drove over the grass in front of the building.

Petka said it's likely the Ford Fiesta got stuck because the lawn was saturated with melted snow.

Alima, however, maintains he wasn't drunk, suggesting the breath tester was broken.

He said he drove to the station with his 14-year-old son to report threatening phone calls he'd received.

'I absolutely 100 percent wasn't 
drunk. This happened by mistake,' Alima, who claims he has a clean 
record, told Chicago Tribune. 'If I really was drunk, why would I go to the police?'

He said he had two beers about two hours before he got behind the wheel and that he wasn't sure where to park at the police station.

Alima
 said he and his son were planning to go to the gym after the police visit. 

Alima was released on $1,000 bail the same night and faces court on April 4.
