News International made an abject apology for ‘shameful’ phone hacking by the News of the World at the public inquiry into Press standards yesterday.

A lawyer for the company said that the newspaper, closed earlier this year, had reached both ‘the depths and the heights’ of journalism.

Rhodri Davies QC said that the company now accepted that phone hacking may have gone on after 2007 – when the paper’s royal editor Clive Goodman was jailed – and went beyond a ‘single rogue reporter’.

But he said the paper also produced 
major investigations, such as the Pakistan cricket fixing affair, a 
scandal initially ignored by police.

From Monday the inquiry will hear 
from 21 witnesses, including film and TV stars and relatives of crime 
victims, who will tell of the impact of having their phone messages 
intercepted or their privacy intruded upon by the Press.

The first live evidence is expected to come from the family of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler.

Allegations that Milly’s voicemail 
was hacked on behalf of the News of the World after her disappearance 
triggered the public outrage that led David Cameron to launch a public 
inquiry into the Press.

Among those expected to appear, the 
inquiry heard, are J K Rowling, Hugh Grant, Sienna Miller, Steve Coogan,
Sheryl Gascoigne, Charlotte Church, Anne Diamond, Max Mosley, Alastair 
Campbell and Christopher Jeffries, who was wrongly suspected of Joanna 
Yeates’s murder. A further 30 ‘core participants’ will submit evidence 
in the form of written statements.

Yesterday Mr Davies said: ‘It is 
right that at the formal opening of this inquiry and in public, I should
repeat on behalf of News International the apologies that have been 
made to all those whose phones were hacked or whose families, friends or
associates’ phones were hacked, by or at the behest of staff working at
the News of the World.

‘That phone hacking was wrong. It was shameful. It should never have happened.

‘We accept that there was no public 
interest justification for it and we further accept that it was not the 
subject of a proper and thorough investigation until the Metropolitan 
Police began Operation Weeting in January this year, following the 
supply of certain material to them by News International.’

But he added: ‘Tragically, the News 
of the World managed to plumb both the depths and the heights. The 
depths, I need hardly say, are taken up by phone hacking.

‘The heights are well illustrated by 
the remarkable piece of investigative journalism which exposed very 
recently the willingness of international cricketers to take money to 
fix events in cricket matches and led to the convictions of three 
cricketers. 

‘It was an investigation which no 
private citizen could have taken on, and which no government organ or 
 professional body showed any inclination to take on.’

Mr Davies described the commissioning
of a former detective to carry out numerous surveillance operations for
the paper as ‘wholly unacceptable’ and ‘not journalism’.

But he added: ‘Not everyone who 
worked at the News of the World was involved. There were many fine 
reporters and staff who worked at that newspaper who had no involvement 
in phone hacking and who have suffered in the fallout.’

Mr Davies said he ‘was surprised’ by 
claims from Robert Jay QC, counsel to the inquiry, that 27 News 
International employees were involved in commissioning investigator 
Glenn Mulcaire to phone hack and said ‘our understanding is it certainly
does not add up to 27’.

He also disputed Mr Jay’s claims that Jude Law’s phone was hacked ‘by or for the Sun’.

The whole of the British Press must not be tarnished by the illegal activities at the News of the World, the inquiry was urged.

Jonathan Caplan QC, counsel for Associated Newspapers, which publishes the Daily Mail, Mail on Sunday and Metro, said: ‘We are anxious that the allegations of phone hacking should not be allowed to besmirch the profession as a whole.’

He told Lord Justice Leveson: ‘We need to be clearly aware that any recommendations or restrictions which come out of this inquiry are not simply introduced on the basis of historic transgressions which no longer occur.’

Setting out the position of the newspaper group, Mr Caplan added: ‘It condemns the practice of phone hacking, and so far as it is aware, no journalist at Associated Newspapers has engaged in phone hacking.

‘It does not bribe police officers and, in particular, it condemns the shameful practice of hacking the mobile phones of the victims of crime or of their families.’

He told the inquiry: ‘Of course there is always room for improvement, and for better practices.

‘We do wish, however, to stress that Press standards have vastly improved over the last 20 years under the Press Complaints Commission and under the Editors’ Code of Conduct.

‘Most journalists are hard-working, conscientious and honest, and they passionately believe in what they do.’

Mr Caplan went on: ‘No one involved in this inquiry or outside this room could seriously doubt that a free Press, which is independent of government, is essential to any democracy.’

He said the Daily Mail and its sister paper the Mail on Sunday are successful because they connect with their readership and their values, and went on: ‘That readership will stop buying those newspapers if they feel that they cannot trust its integrity or accuracy.’

Referring to Operation Motorman, an investigation by the Information Commissioner into inquiry agent Stephen Whittamore, who was commissioned by most national papers, including the Daily Mail, the barrister said: ‘The activity which Stephen Whittamore was hired to undertake almost a decade ago was primarily to obtain addresses and telephone numbers, most of which could legally have been obtained if the individual had had the time to research it.

‘It should also be stressed that Mr Whittamore did not work simply for newspapers. He was hired by organisations such as banks, local authorities and firms of solicitors who similarly were seeking to locate people.’

After the Information Commissioner’s report into Whittamore was published in 2006, Paul Dacre, editor-in-chief of Associated Newspapers, banned the use of all inquiry agents, said Mr Caplan, and all Associated journalists are required to abide by the Editors’ Code of Conduct.
