Imagine a world where you no longer have to spend hours putting together Ikea furniture.

Instead, that flat-packed table you purchased will instantly unfold into the right shape while you sit back and relax.

Now,
 the U.S. Army Research Office is hoping to make this a reality by 
providing an $855,000 (£528,000) grant to develop 4D printing 
technology.

4D printing uses
 3D printing- a process that works in a similar way to a laser printer, 
building a solid object from a series of layers with each one printed 
directly on top of the previous one.

But
 4D printing takes 3D printing one step further by allowing 3D-printed 
materials to be programmed to self-assemble into different shapes over 
time.

The concept draws 
inspiration from nature which has the ability to self-replicate and 
repair itself in response to external environmental conditions.

The
 technology has the potential to dramatically change processes in 
construction and manufacturing and could make it easier to build in 
extreme environments.

The 
U.S. Army Research Office is hoping 4D printing will lead to materials 
that allow cars to change their structure or a fabric that enables a 
soldier’s uniform to alter its camouflage.

The
 research grant has been awarded to a trio of university researchers 
from the University of Pittsburgh’s Swanson School of Engineering, 
Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and the University 
of Illinois.

3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is a process that works in a similar way to a laser printer, by 
building a solid object from a series of layers with each one printed 
directly on top of the previous one.

4D printing takes 3D printing one step further by allowing 3D-printed 
materials to be programmed to self-assemble into different shapes over 
time.

It can do this, for instance, by varying water-absorbing 
characteristics in parts of the material that activate a change in shape when they come into 
contact with moisture.

The three 
scientists will combine their expertise to manipulate materials at nano 
and micro levels in order to produce, via 3D printing, materials that 
can modify their structures over time.

‘Rather
 than construct a static material or one that simply changes its shape, 
we’re proposing the development of adaptive, biomimetic composites that 
reprogramme their shape, properties, or functionality on demand, based 
upon external stimuli,’ said principal investigator Anna Balazs.

Co-investigator
 Jennifer Lewis added that current 3D printing technology allows the 
researchers to build in complicated functionality—not just throughout an
 entire structure, but also within specific areas of the structure.

‘If
 you use materials that possess the ability to change their properties 
or shape multiple times, you don’t have to build for a specific, 
one-time use,’ she explained.

The
 research will use responsive fillers embedded within a hydrogel. They 
claim this will open up new routes for producing the next generation of 
smart sensors, coatings, textiles, and structural components.

‘The
 ability to create one fabric that responds to light by changing its 
colour, and to temperature by altering its permeability, and even to an 
external force by hardening its structure, becomes possible through the 
creation of responsive materials that are simultaneously adaptive, 
flexible, lightweight, and strong,’ said Harvard University’s Ralph 
Nuzzo.

‘It’s this ‘complicated functionality’ that makes true 4D printing a game changer.’

Earlier this year, architect Skylar Tibbits announced a project to develop morphing materials using 4D printing.

In
 collaboration with Minneapolis-based group Stratasys, Tibbits set up a 
radical lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to create
 materials that self-assemble.

In
 a similar way to the U.S. Army’s project, Tibbits is aiming to use of 
multi-material 3D printing to programme different properties into 
various parts of a product’s geometry.

The
 idea is that these parts will have varying water-absorbing 
characteristics that activate a change in shape when they come into 
contact with moisture.
