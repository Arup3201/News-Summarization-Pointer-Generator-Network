City of the rich: Research by New World Wealth shows London has retained its place as the dollar-millionaire capital of the world - with 36,600 more residents becoming millionaires in the last 12 months 

They make up almost half of the 840,000 millionaires living in the UK - the third highest in the world behind the U.S. and Japan.

In terms of multi-millionaires (those with assets over $10m), the study by financial specialists New World Wealth shows the capital lies third in the table with 9,700 - behind Hong Kong (15,400) and New York (14,300).  

Geneva in Switzerland has the highest proportion of millionaires, with one in every 12 residents  having worth more than $1m, followed by Zurich (one in 17) and Singapore (one in 22).

Andrew Amolis, the head of research at Johannesburg-based New World Wealth, said London was attractive to millionaires because of the language and the international nature of the city.

He also suggested that buying a house has been easier than in the past with the EU's open border policy allowing people to move to the city far more easily.

Over the past 10 years, worldwide millionaire and multi-millionaire numbers have grown at vastly different rates.  

Millionaire numbers have gone up by 58 per cent during this period, whilst multi-millionaire numbers have gone up by 71 per cent. 

There are currently just over 13 million people worth more than seven figures in the world (as of June. Approximately 495,000 of these individuals can be classified as multi-millionaires.
