At 72 ounces, the steak is big enough to feed nine people.

Then there are portions of bread, soup, salad, baked potato and ice cream – plus servings of tomato juice and milk.

Combine that with five decades of failure by countless customers who have tried to stomach this colossal spread in under an hour - and the Wedgwood Broiler challenge seems unconquerable.

That was until Randy Santel showed up to restaurant in Seattle, Washington – and guzzled the estimated 5,000-calorie gut-busting banquet with 18 minutes still on the clock.

Gut-busting: The enormous steak, served at the Wedgwood Broiler in Seattle, was complemented by a bread roll, soup, salad, baked potato and servings of milk and tomato juice. It took Mr Santel 42 minutes to finish it

As well as earning a place in American food folklore, the 6ft 5in-tall bodybuilder, who weighs 230lb, got the $75 back that he had paid for the platter.

Kitchen manager Mike Hamman was stunned when he witnessed the meal being devoured by this hulk of a man, who chewed in rhythm to Dixie Chicks tracks on his Hannah Montana MP3 player.

He was even more shocked when Mr Santel, 25, ordered an extra glass of soda and also added four tall glasses of lemonade.

Even more astoundingly, he polished off a beer that an astonished customer offered to buy him after completing the challenge in 41 minutes and 46 seconds.

‘We have no documentation of anybody ever finishing this,’ Mr Hamman told Seattle Post Intelligencer newspaper.

‘I was in awe just after he finished the steak. Most people can’t even get to the sides.’

The restautant does not reveal nutrition values for the challenge. But it is estimated to contain at least 5,000 calories and 22g of fat - more than double the daily allowance.

Mr
 Santel, from Kansas City, Missouri, said he hoped to eat the steak 
faster ‘but it was cooked almost between medium-well and well, which 
made it a lot harder to chew.’

Grease: Within a day of eating the steak, Mr Santel had devoured this 6lb burger with buns made from grilled cheese sandwiches as the Loose Wheel in Tacoma, Washington

ll in a day's work: Hours before he had also eaten this 2ft-long Big Dawg hotdog at Wing Central in Seattle

Appetiser: Shortly before, he also downed this three-litre bowl of ramen soup at Kobe Sushi Bar Restaurant

But Mr Santel, a former Missouri State University football player who suffered obesity problems as a child, did have one trick up his sleeve.

He had already completed more than 100 challenges across the U.S – in a bizarre bid to show the world how to ‘eat fat but remain fit’.

Mr Santel follows a new competitive eating mania, which has in part been sparked by TV show Man V Food.

But Mr Santel goes to lengths to point out that Adam Richman, the host of that programme, has only scored 37 ‘wins’.

Since he embarked on his competitive eating adventure two years ago, he has eaten everything from heaps of hotdogs, a 6lb burrito and a 28in pizza.

He had also knocked off an 84oz steak challenge in New York – but that didn’t include so many additional items.

Steaking a claim: The Wedgwood Broiler in Seattle, where Mr Santel ate a 72oz sirloin

Challenge: Mt Santel's website. His bizzarre mission is to show the world how to 'eat fat and stay fit'

Mr Santel, who has his own website and posts videos on Facebook of some of the challenges, had already polished off three challenges in the 24 hours before arriving at the Wedgwood.

He guzzled down fries and a 6lb bacon burger with grilled cheese sandwiches for a bun at Seattle’s The Loose Wheel Sports Bar and Grill.

After that was he ate a 1lb doughnut in Auburn before swallowing a 2ft-long chili-cheese hot dog with jalepenos, onions and a side of yet more fries.

And just a few hours before the steak challenge, he gulped down  a three-litre bowl of ramen noodle soup at Kobe Sushi Bar and Restaurant in Bellevue.

Mr Santel says the only thing holding him back from doing more challenges is his girlfriend.

‘It sucks I'm not single,’ he told the Seattle Weekly who has so far competed in 15 states.

‘Not I want to break up with my girlfriend or whatever, but I'd like to move out west.’

The highest concentration of eating challenges is in California
