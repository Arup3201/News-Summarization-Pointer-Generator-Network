In a candid interview the President has insisted that his Affordable Care Act would survive and be remembered as
 a positive step for the country.

Obama confidently told Barbara Walters on ABC news on Friday that his Healthcare Act will be remembered positively, despite his poor approval rating.

'I've gone up and down pretty much consistently throughout,' Obama said. 'But the good thing about when you're down is that usually you got nowhere to go but up.'

President Obama believes that despite the negative attention towards the Affordable Healthcare Act, he will be remembered well

Michelle Obama and the president spoke about how negative attention is just 'part of the job'

An ABC News-Washington Post poll published last week showed that Obama's approval rating had dropped by 13 percentage points this year and is now only at 42 per cent.

This is the lowest rating during his presidency. His approval rating in regard to understanding problems of average Americans was even lower at 41 per cent.

But the President shrugged off his low rating, saying: 'We get a lot more cheers.'

His wife, Michelle, added: 'I've been booed and I'm more popular.'

The first lady was defensive of her husband, adding: 'I've got his back. From five years to today, to forever.'

Republicans have been doing 
everything they can to use the healthcare glitch against Obama. The 
affordable healthcare act has been called a 'broken promise' and the 
president has been heckled during public speeches.

But
 the President said: 'I got re-elected in part because people did think
 I was trustworthy and they knew I was working on their behalf.'

'Very rarely are the good things that happen get the same attention as the things that aren't working so well.'

Mrs Obama added: 'It's a hard job. I 
am fortunate to be living with a man who has a long view of this job, 
who understands that, in the case of healthcare that this is all about 
the folks who don't have insurance, the folks he sees every single day.'

She added: 'I've got his back. From five years to today, to forever.'

Part of the couple's obvious 
commitment to each other is the way they have made the White House a 
family home where their daughters Sasha and Malia can lead a relatively 
normal life.

Mrs Obama said: 'We both try to make 
the home a sanctuary. Our daughters are there and they dominate the 
conversations.'

The couple are fiercely protective of their daughters' privacy, refusing to be drawn on whether 15-year-old Malia dates.

While they admitted that she 'can 
date' they refused to discover her 'private business' and said only that
 she 'does what normal teenagers do'.

The Obamas have converted former 
guest quarters on the third floor of the White House into a room where 
the girls can hold slumber parties, with the President saying: 'There's a
 lot of giggling behind closed doors. I have no idea what's going on.'

Their daughters will also continue to
 have an impact on future decisions the family make, with Obama saying 
that whether they choose to return to Chicago at the end of his 
presidency will depend on what Sasha, who will be a sophomore, wants.

Obama said he is grateful for Americans on Thanksgiving who are doing everything they can 'to make it'

'Sasha has a big vote in returning to
 Chicago. Michelle and the girls sacrificed a lot for my cockimany idea 
of running for office.'

When asked whether he would remain in politics, Mrs Obama interrupted her husband, with a definite 'No'.

'I've run my last campaign,' the 
President said, adding that although he would no longer be an elected 
official he would continue to care about his issues.

The couple said they had their first glimpse of their future over the summer, when their girls were at camp and they were home alone with just the dogs for company.

Bo and Sunny, two Portuguese Water Dogs, are a big part of the family, with the first lady admitting, much to Obama's shock, that when her husband is away, she lets Bo share her bed.

When Walters reminded Obama he had 
said he wanted to be a good one-term President rather than a mediocre 
second-term, and asked which he though he was the President said: 'I'm 
shooting for a good second-term President. In your second-term you are 
mindful you only have a little time left.'

Obama is just as committed to his 
role as president. 'I continue to believe and [I'm] absolutely convinced
 that at the end of the day, people are going to look back at the work 
we've done to make sure that in this country, you don't go bankrupt when
 you get sick, that families have that security,' the president 
said about the Affordable Healthcare Act.

'That is going be a legacy I am extraordinarily proud of,' he said.Â 

During the interview he also predicted that the U.S. would soon have its first female president.

'We have some amazing female [public] servants all across the country and there is no doubt that sometime very soon, we're going to have a female president,' he said. 'I'm confident that she will do a great job.'

Walters asked Obama if he thought his wife would do a better job as president than he would. He responded, 'that's an easy question, but she is smart enough to know that she might not want to go through the process.'

The first lady said that she didn't have the 'patience' her husband has.

In a message to the hard-working Americans, Obama said: 'Every day I'm going be working as hard as I can on your behalf ... For all the challenges and all the polarization of our politics and the frustrations of Washington, this remains and will remain the greatest country on Earth.'
