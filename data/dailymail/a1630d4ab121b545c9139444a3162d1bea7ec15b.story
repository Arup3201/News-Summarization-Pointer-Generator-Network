Elsewhere, Nike have produced a new boot collection for the likes of Wayne Rooney, Neymar and Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

Nike have also released the new range just in time for the first week of the Champions League as the world's best players prepare to do battle.

Long gone are the days of players just wearing black boots as fans will be able to spot Neymar and Rooney in bright orange as well as Ibrahimovic in the 'Neo-Turquoise' Mercurial Superfly.

Neymar wanted the Nike Hypervenoms to 'enhance' his agility and give the star more time on the ball

Ahead of the creation of Nike's Hypervenom boot, Neymar was sure to tell the company exactly what he wanted.

According to Nike, the Barcelona star asked: 'Help me make space more often and more quickly. I want a boot that helps enhance my agility and gives me the space to get my shot off before I’m closed down.'
