John Podesta, the Obama 
administration's latest key personnel addition, was forced to apologize 
to Republicans on Wednesday for a remark that compared them to a 
murderous cult that killed more than 900 adults and children in 1978.

In
 an interview conducted before President Obama announced his return to 
the White House, Podesta told Politico magazine that the president 
should take a harder line against Republicans who are slowing down 
Democrats' agenda in the House of Representatives.

'They
 need to focus on executive action given that they are facing a second 
term against a cult worthy of Jonestown in charge of one of the houses 
of Congress,' Podesta told the startup magazine.

Obama named Podesta to his Global Development Council just before Thanksgiving. The White House later confirmed that he 'will be joining the White House staff as a counselor to the President' in 2014.

Podesta has helmed the Center for American Progress since the end of the Clinton administration, but is now facing fresh criticism after comparing the GOP to a death cult

Dead bodies littered the ground in Jonestown, Guyana on November 18, 1978 after a mass suicide of People's Temple cult followers, led by Jim Jones. More than 900 adults and children died after drinking cyanide-laced punch

Congressman Leo Ryan (L) was killed while investigating reports that Americans were being kept prisoner at the Jonestown religious colony. His aide Jackie Speier (R) was wounded in the ambush, and now serves in Congress.

A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner immediately fired back against the comparison with the 1970s Jonestown cult.

'For
 those whoâ€™ve forgotten, a Democratic member of Congress was murdered in
 Jonestown and a current one, Rep. Jackie Speier, was shot five times 
during the same incident,' Brendan Buck said Wednesday in a statement.

'If this is the attitude of the new White House, it's hard to see how the president gets anything done again.'

Jim
 Jones, the charismatic 'Peoples Temple' cult leader, brought his 
followers to Guyana in 1977, settling in a compound named 'Jonestown' in
 his honor.

Most of his 
eventual victims died in 1978 after downing a fruit punch-flavored drink
 spiked with cyanide. Jones later shot himself in the head.

John 'Jones' Boehner? Podesta had to apologize to the Speaker of the House for equating his leadership to that of the murderous People's Temple cult

While most of the cultists died of cyanide poisoning after drinking poisoned fruit punch, authorities said five of them, including Jim Jones, died of gunshot wounds

He
 called the event a 'revolutionary suicide,' and told his followers to 
take their own lives after ordering them to ambush a congressional 
delegation that had traveled to Guyana to assist Americans who wanted to
 flee the Jonestown colony.

While 'drinking the Kool-Aid' has become political shorthand for believing in self-promoting leaders and their outlandish positions, the Jonestown victims drank Flavor Aid -- mixed with cyanide, Valium, Phenergan and chloral hydrate

California
 Democratic Rep. Leo Ryan perished in that attack. Jackie Speier, then 
one of his congressional staffers, sustained five gunshot wounds.  She 
is now a member of Congress herself.

After Politico's magazine published its interview with Podesta, he apologized â€“ via Twitter.

'In
 an old interview, my snark got in front of my judgment,' he wrote. 'I 
apologize to Speaker Boehner, whom I have always respected.'

Podesta
 served as chief of staff in the Clinton White House, and founded the 
Center for American Progress after the administration's tenure ended.

He was also in charge of the Obama transition team after the president's historic 2008 election.

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Wednesday that Podesta was right in thinking he needed to apologize.

'He clearly thought he did, since he issued one very quickly,'  Carney told reporters.
