These incredible pictures show how storms have stripped some of Britain’s top beaches of millions of tonnes of sand - leaving them strewn with rocks and green slime.

Experts say the effects of last year’s severe storms is only now being felt along some of the most beautiful coastal parts of the UK.

Fistral Beach, Bude and Perranporth in Cornwall have been all but decimated, leaving the British Costa looking drab and lacklustre.

The images from Fistral Beach in Newquay, Cornwall - a world famous spot for surfing - show it stripped of its golden sand and covered in stones and seaweed.

Officials say the beach has lost 125.37 cubic metres of sand per metre of beach - or the equivalent to half a billion bags of sugar.

The popular holiday spot in Newquay, Cornwall, is regarded as Britain’s finest surfing location and regularly hosts international competitions.

It also sits under an iconic hotel which appeared in the film The Witches.

Before the sand shifting occurred, Fistral Beach in Cornwall was a popular destination for tourists and surfers

But so much sand has vanished that the once golden shoreline is now dotted with razor-sharp rocks which are covered in slippery green seaweed and algae.

Lifeguards say their job has become harder as the submerged rocks pose a danger to swimmers and surfers.

To their dismay, boffins have warned it could take years for the sand - now languishing offshore in mountainous sandbanks and bars - to return.

Similar sand loss has been seen along the coast - including Perranporth and Bude.

Greg Spray, RNLI lifeguard manager for Newquay, said: 'The winter storms altered the topography of many of Cornwall’s beaches this year, and the shifting sand has created some strong rip currents and exposed bedrock on some beaches.

'As a result the lifeguards have worked extremely hard all summer advising the public of the hazards and keeping people as safe as possible.

'The beach is an ever-changing environment and lifeguards continually monitor and assess the conditions to ensure the flagged bathing areas are situated within the safest area of the water, and the hazardous areas are clearly highlighted.'

Saber Atmen, of Fistral Beach Surf School, said the newly exposed rocks are restricting surf lessons.

He said: 'I’ve been here for 11 years and this is the worst I’ve seen it. It was pretty bad in 2005 or 2006, but it’s never been worse than this.

'We can’t go in the sea at any time of the day. We’re having to work around it and try to avoid the high tide by two hours.

'If we did it at high tide, it could potentially be dangerous.'

Gerd Masselink, a professor of coastal geomorphology, from Plymouth University said there had been a 'dramatic' loss of sand and gravel from several famous Cornish beaches.

He said most of the missing sand has been deposited in sand banks and bars deeper offshore.

Perranporth lost 210.28 cubic metres of sand per metre of beach - about a million tonnes of sand.

Bude lost almost all of its beach, although some locations such as St Ives have actually gained sand.

He said: 'So far we haven’t seen much recovery. This is bad news for tourism.

'After last winter’s storms it might take another four years for the beaches to recover.'

Malcolm Bell, head of Visit Cornwall, added: 'It would be lovely to get the sand back as soon as possible but nature will take its time.'
