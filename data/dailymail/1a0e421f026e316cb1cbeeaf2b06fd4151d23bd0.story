A Georgia woman has been fired from a fast food joint after a customer found an unexpected topping in her cheeseburger: a half-smoked marijuana cigarette.

Amy Seiber, 32, is no longer an employee at Wendy's Lovejoy store after admitting to police that she 'misplaced' the joint inside a burger - after smoking half of it at work.

The customer Shalon Travis, 39, called police after discovering the marijuana in her burger, placed right on top of the pickle.

The police report states that Travis had picked up a Wendy's single cheeseburger combo from the drive-through window of the 11121 Tara Boulevard Wendy's around 10:30pm November 1.

'Upon arrival at home, she took her food out of the bag and noticed a strange odor in her hamburger,' Officer Gaddis told the Atlanta Constitution-Journal.

'When she opened it, she discovered a partially smoked marijuana cigarette.'

She was admitted to hospital after suffering symptoms similar to food poisoning.

According to TMZ, Seiber owned up to the marijuana mishap as soon as police arrived at the Lovejoy Wendy's.

She was arrested for possession of less than an ounce of marijuana.

Management at Wendy's promptly fired Seiber.

The customer told TMZ that the Wendy's franchise offered to help with Travis' medical bills.

'Obviously the employee broke the rules and did not follow proper food handling steps... We are deeply sorry that this incident occurred,' a Wendy's spokeperson told TMZ.

The company also provided the customer with a $50 gift certificate for Wendy's, though after her last experience it's unclear if she plans to use it.

Seiber was able to bond out of the Clayton County Jail.
