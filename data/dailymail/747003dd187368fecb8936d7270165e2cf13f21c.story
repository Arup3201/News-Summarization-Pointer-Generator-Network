Jack Wilshere missed Arsenal's pre-Monaco training session on Tuesday morning as he continues his recovery from an ankle injury.

The England midfielder was absent from first-team training, but is understood to have worked in the gym.

Manager Arsene Wenger, however, insisted that Wilshere has not suffered an setback from the injury that kept him out for four months.

Wenger said: 'Wilshere missed training but it was just a precaution. 

'He trained hard to come back from injury, and we rested him - but no way is it a setback. He's not involved tomorrow [Wednesday] but will certainly be available for the weekend.'

Wilshere made his return to the bench at the win at Crystal Palace on Saturday, but remained an unused substitute.

One player who did train with the first-team, however, was 17-year-old midfielder Krystian Bielik - a January arrival from Legia Warsaw.

Meanwhile, Wenger wants his Arsenal team to embrace the pressure of going into the clash as favourites.

The Gunners have faced European giants Bayern Munich (twice), Barcelona and AC Milan in the last-16 stage in the last four years and crashed out on every occasion.

However, the Gunners will head into the Monaco tie as favourites to qualify for the quarter-finals and Wenger says his side are ready to cope with the expectation.
