Former vice president Dick Cheney believes that a terrorist attack even worse than the destruction of the twin towers on September 11, 2001 is probable before the end of the decade.

Cheney appeared on Hugh Hewitt’s radio show on Tuesday and was asked if he thought the United States would ‘get through this decade without another massive attack on the homeland.’

‘I doubt it,’ Cheney said. ‘I think there will be another attack and the next time I think it’s likely to be far deadlier than the last one. You can just imagine what would happen if somebody could smuggle a nuclear device, put it in a shipping container, and drive it down the beltway outside Washington D.C.’

Hewitt wondered if the government could continue in such a scenario and Cheney recalled a Cold War era plan for constitutional government in the event of a nuclear attack.

‘Basically, it involved having a government in waiting if you will ready to go in the event of  nuclear attack on the United States so that we could always maintain the constitutional-based governmental authority,’ he explained.

‘We operated and actually trained under circumstances of how would we go about providing for a government to survive if we were having nuclear weapons from the Soviet Union falling all over the country.’

Cheney and his daughter Liz last week announced the launch of The Alliance for a Strong America, which they’ve described as a ‘grassroots organization that will advocate for a restoration of American strength and power.’

Harsh: Dick Cheney and his daughter Liz - a former deputy assistant secretary of state - have harsh words for Obama's handling of the insurgency in Iraq

The Cheneys have posted a video to 
YouTube about their organization, which the video’s description says 
will attack 'the dangerous policies of the Obama Administration' and 
promises to keep 'policies necessary to protect the nation' in the 
spotlight.

Concerning the current situation in Iraq, the Cheneys oppose the president's plan for the uprising and are critical of his actions before the uprisings that allowed the jihadi group Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) to grow. 

'Rarely has a U.S. president been so wrong about so much at the expense 
of so many,' the Cheneys wrote in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal last week.

'Too many times to count, Mr. Obama has told us he is 
"ending" the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan—as though wishing made it so.

'His rhetoric has now come crashing into reality. Watching the black-clad
 ISIS jihadists take territory once secured by American blood is final 
proof, if any were needed, that America's enemies are not "decimated." 
They are emboldened and on the march.'

Fore! The Cheneys say that while the situation in Iraq escalates, Obama is playing golf and talking about climate change

The Cheneys contend that the uprising in 
Iraq is not just a threat to Iraqis, but to Americans, as well, as the 
country could become a safe-haven for al Qaeda and other terrorist 
groups that could carry out 9/11-style attacks on the U.S. and its 
allies.

The Cheneys mention trips they've been on to the Middle East, where government officials are confused as to what Obama has been doing in the region following the wars in Irag and Afghanistan, and say that the president is abandoning the few friends the U.S. has in the Arab world.

'In one Arab capital, a senior official pulled out a map of Syria and
 Iraq,' the Cheneys write.

'Drawing an arc with his finger from Raqqa province in northern 
Syria to Anbar province in western Iraq, he said, "They will control 
this territory. Al Qaeda is building safe havens and training camps 
here. Don't the Americans care?"

'Our president doesn't seem to. Iraq is at risk of falling to a radical 
Islamic terror group and Mr. Obama is talking climate change.

'Terrorists
 take control of more territory and resources than ever before in 
history, and he goes golfing. He seems blithely unaware, or indifferent 
to the fact, that a resurgent al Qaeda presents a clear and present 
danger to the United States of America.'

Brutal: ISIS crucified this man and left a note on his body saying 'Cleanliness is a civilized matter that shows ur ethics and love for country

After the Iraq War, the Cheneys say al Qaeda was nearly defeated in the country thanks primarily to military efforts by the U.S. and its allies. Rather than stay in the country and make sure the peace was preserved, Obama pulled the U.S. out of the unfinished conflict, according to the Cheneys.

Mr. Obama had only to negotiate an agreement to leave behind some 
residual American forces, training and intelligence capabilities to help
 secure the peace. Instead, he abandoned Iraq and we are watching 
American defeat snatched from the jaws of victory.

The Cheneys cite a Rand study that shows a 58 percent increase in the number of Salafi-jihadists between 2010 and 2013. They say that 'in the face of this threat, Mr. Obama is busy ushering America's adversaries into positions of power in the Middle East.'

'First it was the Russians in Syria. Now, in a move that defies 
credulity, he toys with the idea of ushering Iran into Iraq,' they write. 'Only a fool
 would believe American policy in Iraq should be ceded to Iran, the 
world's largest state sponsor of terror.'

Violence: The number of Iraqis executed by ISIS since the uprising began is in the thousands

They write that there is 'a dire need for American leadership around the world' and that the president has failed our allies by abandoning conflicts before they are actually over.

'It is time the president and his allies faced some hard truths: America 
remains at war, and withdrawing troops from the field of battle while 
our enemies stay in the fight does not "end" wars. Weakness and retreat 
are provocative. U.S. withdrawal from the world is disastrous and puts 
our own security at risk,' the Cheneys write. 

They went on to quote former President - and conservative hero - Ronald Reagan.

In 1983, President Ronald Reagan said, "If history teaches anything, it 
teaches that simple-minded appeasement or wishful thinking about our 
adversaries is folly. It means the betrayal of our past, the squandering
 of our freedom." President Obama is on track to securing his legacy as 
the man who betrayed our past and squandered our freedom.
