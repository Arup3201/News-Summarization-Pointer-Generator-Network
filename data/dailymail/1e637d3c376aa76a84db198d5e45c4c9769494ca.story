Chemical and radiation experts were yesterday called in following the unexplained death of a man found inside a tent in a field.

Police said that there was a ‘strong odour of chemicals’ inside the tent in Port Meadow, Oxford, and officials from the chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear team had been sent to the scene.

The body was found yesterday afternoon by a passer-by, who became concerned about what he could see and looked inside the tent, before smelling the chemicals and immediately calling police.

Within an hour the entire area of Port Meadow had been sealed off and specialist teams began examining the tent and the body for clues to the source and type of the chemicals.

Police said the identity of the dead man was not yet known. The chemical involved in the alert was suspected to be hydrogen sulphide, which can lead to death within minutes when inhaled.

Residents living near Port Meadow said that emergency services including police and ambulance staff, had been gathering in the nearby area of Jericho at a rendezvous spot set up by police.

All other access points for the meadow were also closed off and a police helicopter was seen hovering over the site.

Oxford University student Rami Koujah, 22, who lives nearby said: ‘The whole of Port Meadow is closed off. Someone from the emergency services told us there had been a chemical spill.’

Sushila Dhall, chairman of Oxford Pedestrians Association, added: ‘I tried to get onto the meadow but I was turned away and was told there had been a toxic spillage. There were people in full-body suits and police are stopping people from going onto the meadow.’

Police said the death was being treated as unexplained but 'at this time' there appeared to be no suspicious circumstances.

Superintendent Steve Hockin, of Thames Valley Police, said: 'Early indications are that the chemical involved in the death of the man is hydrogen sulphide, but emergency services are working together to examine the scene and recover the body as safely as possible.'

A police spokesman said: ‘Thames Valley Police is currently attending the scene of an unexplained death in a field at Port Meadow, Wolvercote, Oxford.

‘A member of public discovered the body of a man in a tent while walking in the Port Meadow area. The body was confirmed as deceased at the scene, which presented a strong odour of chemicals.

‘The area has been cordoned off as specially-trained CBRN officers attend the scene to ensure its safety, before further investigations can take place,’ said the spokesman.

‘Thames Valley Police, Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service and South Central Ambulance Service (SCAS) are working together to progress access to allow investigations.

‘The public is advised to avoid the area contained within the cordon and a number of local footpaths have been closed, until such time as access restrictions are lifted.’
