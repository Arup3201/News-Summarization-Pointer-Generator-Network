Jay Miller, 21, (pictured outside Cardiff Crown Court yesterday), denies four counts of actualÂ bodily harm and one of inflicting grievous bodily harm

A babysitter is accused of assaulting a toddler in his care, causing fractures to both of her arms and leaving her face and ears bruised.

Jay Miller, 21, was arrested on suspicion of injuring the little girl after she was admitted to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff with a spiral fracture to her upper right arm.

Doctors said a fracture of that kind was usually the result of pulling and twisting an arm and further X-rays revealed the youngster also had two other untreated fractures on her lower arms, both of which were healing.

Medics said those fractures could have occurred about 10 days earlier and said the girl's facial bruising could have been caused by slapping or grabbing by an adult hand.

Prosecutor Ieuan Bennett told the jury: 'There is no dispute she had the injuries - the question is how were they caused.

'Were they caused accidentally or by an unlawful assault?'

Miller, of Barry, Wales, denied four charges of causing actual bodily harm and one of inflicting grievous bodily harm when he appeared at Cardiff Crown Court yesterday.

The jury heard he had minded the young girl in the preceding days when her mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had to go to a hospital appointment.

Mr Bennett said: 'He has trouble controlling his temper and when he is under stress, lashes out.

'He was probably having trouble with her - maybe she was crying too loud - one knows not - but he snapped.'

He suggested Miller may have lost his temper because the child did not use her potty correctly or had made a mess with her food, and also alleged that at the hospital he was heard muttering: 'I'm sorry'.

The child's grandmother told the court she had asked questions about the bruises, which appeared on the child's face and ears in the days before the spiral fracture.

She told the court: 'He said he had taken her for a walk and she had fallen down a grass bank and hit a wall.'

She said she saw Miller at the hospital as the child was being examined.

The court heard how the young girl was found to have fractures to both of her lower arms, a spiral fracture to her upper arm and facial bruising when she was taken to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff (pictured)

'He was sitting with his head down saying "I'm sorry, I'm so sorry," she said.

'I didn't ask him why. Knowing there would be a police investigation, I didn't want to alert him to my concerns and him come up with an explanation.'

The child's mother said Miller was concerned when he knew social services were involved.

She told the court: 'He said, "They'll blame me - I'll be going to prison - that's what social services are like."'

Asked about the bruises, Miller told police: 'I know I haven't hit her and never said "I'm sorry."'

The trial continues.
