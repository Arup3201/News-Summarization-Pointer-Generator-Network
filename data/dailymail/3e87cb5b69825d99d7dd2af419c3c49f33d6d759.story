A cure for dementia or a drug that can halt the disease in its tracks will be available by 2025, the Prime Minister has said.

David Cameron has pledged to double the amount that is spent on research into the devastating illness and to help speed up the development of treatments.

At a summit in London attended by the health ministers of the G8 nations – including the US, Canada, Japan and France – he said that a cure was ‘within our grasp’.

There are around 800,000 adults in Britain with dementia – and 44 million worldwide – but these numbers are predicted to double in the next 40 years as the population ages.

But despite the vast numbers affected, there are only a handful of treatments available, and these only temporarily slow the advance of the disease.

The Prime Minister yesterday unveiled a package of measures, with the health ministers of G8 states promising to share more research across national boundaries and to  cut the bureaucratic hurdles which delay treatments becoming available to patients.

A drug which would stop dementia in its tracks could soon be on the market

Mr Cameron told the summit in central London yesterday: ‘This disease steals lives, wrecks families and breaks hearts.

‘If we are to beat dementia, we must also work globally, with nations, business and scientists from all over the world working together as we did with cancer, and with HIV and Aids.’

He added: ‘This is going to be a  bigger and bigger issue, the key is to keep pushing. The challenge is huge and we are a long way from a cure, but there is hope.’

Last week, researchers from University College London said they hoped that a monthly jab capable of halting dementia in its tracks could become available within the next five years. The drug – solanezumab – is in trials and could be given to patients even before symptoms have developed if the disease is picked up in scans.

And yesterday a brain scan capable of accurately diagnosing Alzheimer’s became available on the NHS for the first time.

The test – which costs £810 – distinguishes the illness from other forms of dementia, meaning patients can be given the most effective treatments.

Ministers hope they can speed up the time it takes for drugs to come on to the market by removing some of the unnecessary safety checks and regulations.

It can take at least ten years for drugs to be offered to patients after they are first developed – but politicians believe this could be slashed to two or three.

Health secretary Jeremy Hunt, who was also at yesterday’s summit, said: ‘The amount going into research is too little.

‘We would like a cure to be available by 2025. It’s a big, big ambition to have. If we don’t aim for the stars we won’t land on the moon.’

Jeremy Hughes, chief executive of the Alzheimer’s Society, said: ‘The UK has demonstrated global leadership on tackling dementia.

‘We have committed to a global plan, better support for people with dementia through research, and the Prime Minister has agreed to narrow the funding gap between dementia and cancer research – something we have long campaigned for.

‘Dementia has come out of the shadows and is centre stage, but we must ensure G8 has a lasting legacy.’

Dementia is a progressive disease, meaning that symptoms cannot be reversed. Symptoms include loss of memory, mood changes, and trouble communicating. The most common types of dementia are Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia.
