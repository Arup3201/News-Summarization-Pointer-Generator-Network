Don't pass the ball to Kobe.

Nineteen years into his illustrious career, Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant finally entered the record books last night in the worst way possible when he broke the NBA record for most missed shots by a player.

This as the Lakers fell to the Memphis Grizzles 107 - 102.

One for the record books: Kobe Bryant (above) entered the record books for all the wrong reasons last night when he became the most missing shooter in NBA history

These were probably banked: Bryant has now missed 13,418 shots in his career

And while it was a bad night for Kobe, it was a very, very good night for former Boston Celtics forward John Havlicek who is now only the second worst shooter in the history of the game.

To be fair, a look at the players who top the record board for this infamous honor includes the greats of the game, with Michael Jordan sixth on the list, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar fifth and Karl Malone fourth.

Among the active players who could perhaps surpass Bryant are Vince Carter, Kevin Garnett and Dirk Nowitzki, who are all right outside the top ten.

Bryant needed 13 misses heading in to last night's game to claim the record, and lucky number 13 came in the fourth quarter, pushing his lifetime total to 13,418 botched ball throws. 

Only the second worst: Bryant broke the record set by Boston Celtics forward John Havlicek (above)

On a much more positive note, Bryant  still remains the youngest player in league history to notch 30,000 career points, is the all time leading scoring in Lakers history, one of the game's most storied franchise, and has won the All-Star MVP a record four times.

He also has two gold medals and has won the NBA championships five times with the Lakers.

Off the court, Bryant is notoriously private and press shy, especially following accusations in 2003 that he raped a hotel employee at a Colorado spa.

So in love: Bryant and his wife Vanessa, mother of his two children, Natalia and Gianna

The case was eventually dropped and a civil suit settled out of court.

Bryant has been married to his wife Vanessa for 13 years, who scored a very nice and very expensive diamond apology ring following the aforementioned accusations said to be worth $4million, and the couple have two daughters, Natalia and Gianna.
