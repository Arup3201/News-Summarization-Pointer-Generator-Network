California's grape growers say they are expecting one of the earliest harvests seen to date - and it's all because of the weather.

Although the state enjoys a balmy climate all year round, this year's unexpectedly dry Spring has hastened the arrival of this year's crop.

What's more, say wine experts, the unseasonably early harvest could result in vintages that are 'bolder' and stronger than usual.

Farmers usually have to wait until 
August for the first signs of ripening but say grapes are already 
turning purple and expect to gather in the fruit three weeks early.

According to Tom Davies, the owner of V. 
Sattui Winery in Napa Valley, the sight of swiftly purpling fruit marks the start of a three week countdown to harvest.

'It's all due to the weather,' he revealed in an interview with ABC News. 'The dry spring kick started the grape growing season.'

Although an early harvest isn't entirely without precedent, it happens on average once every 10 years, with the last recorded in 2009 according to growers.

But while the red wine grapes still have another few weeks to go, the white grapes are ready now according to champagne grape growers, who say they will start bringing in the crop next week.

Happily for Californian wine lovers, the unusually early harvest won't have an impact on the taste of the eventual wine.

'If we have an earlier harvest, for the north coast, it's a good thing because this is a cooler climate area,' added Davies.

'If we can get the grapes in sooner then we're not backed up into late October and early November and that's when bad things happen.'
