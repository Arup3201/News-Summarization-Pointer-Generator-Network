Air conditioning units fitted at a school gym that athletes were using for training have been removed just days after the end of the Olympic games.

The gym at Rokeby School in Newham, East London was known to be stiflingly hot and one teacher claimed that pupils could only use it for 15 minutes at a time because of the high temperatures.

There have even been cases in the past of children fainting during PE lessons as a result of the conditions.

Teachers at the school have now hit out at LOCOG as 'hypocrites' who were going against the idea of the Olympic legacy.

The gymnasium at Rokeby School in deprived Newham, East London, had air con installed so athletes could train there before the Olympics

Organisers agreed to install air conditioning units in the school's gym so that volleyball teams could train in the sports hall a mile away from the Olympic stadium.

But in contrast to the 'Olympic legacy' promised to East London and the rest of the capital, the generators powering the new air conditioning units were removed as soon as the Games finished.

LOCOG confirmed the air conditioning units would not remain at the all-boys school, prompting critics to label the 'sporting legacy'.

One teacher at the school branded the situation 'complete hypocrisy', while other staff, including the headteacher, were said to be 'very angry'.

The teacher, who did not wish to be named, said LOCOG removed the air conditioning in the stifling gym even though the school offered to pay to keep it in place.

Training base: LOCOG temporarily upgraded the school's gym so volleyball players could train there before competing at London 2012

Details emerged as David Cameron said Britain needed to 'use the inspiration of the Games to get children playing sport more regularly'.

A pupil at the boy’s secondary school reportedly collapsed in the sports hall and was rushed to hospital in the last week of term - just days before air conditioning was installed for the arrival of athletes.

Pupils are currently limited to using the hall for 15 minutes at a time, according to teachers, one of whom went as far as saying the the building was 'making children ill'.

Rokeby School, in the London borough of Newham, is just a mile from the Olympic Park in Stratford, and its students come from some of the poorest families in the capital.

LOCOG, which was in charge of the school site during the Games, said the sports hall did not need permanent air conditioning because term did not fall 'during the hottest summer months.'

A teacher at the school, who asked not to be named said: 'We have a lot of children getting headaches and experiencing breathing problems after playing sport in there. The building is making children ill.

'It is one of the most used buildings in the whole school and is used by after school clubs as well.'

Legacy: Rokeby School is around one mile from the Olympics Stadium in East London

Simon Shaw, 53, a former teacher at Rokeby who is close friends with a number of teaching staff at the school said: 'They are furious. They wanted to keep the air conditioning but they’ve just been walked over.

'There is a big issue with ventilation in the sports hall - pupils have actually collapsed from overheating. They said the Olympics were going to bring all these benefits to children in an area that really needs them and its just rubbish.

'They bend over backwards for athletes, but as far as they are concerned children can just suffer. It is disgraceful.'

A LOCOG spokeswoman said: 'The air cooling used during the Olympics is temporary. Historically it might have been needed during the hottest summer months.

'Those months are not when school normally happens, so the removal will not affect the students ability to enjoy their physical education classes during regular school months.

'We always made it clear that the facilities we were putting in were for the Games time period only.

'The air conditioning was hired by LOCOG and therefore there was no option for the school to buy from us.

'However the school did get upgrade works paid for by the Olympic delivery Authority, such as the installation of a new floor.'
