A couple got married in a hospital chapel so the bride's father who is on a transplant list could walk his daughter down the aisle. 

Proud dad Timothy Lewis was admitted to Methodist Hospital in Houston, Texas, where he is on the heart transplant list.

His youngest daughter Lolaycia was planning to get married in March but instead she brought the wedding forward and planned it in seven days so her father would be there.

Lolaycia married Melmiah Walker on Saturday at 2pm in front of family and friends.

Mr Lewis said: 'To have this energy to be able to walk my daughter down the aisle is very, very special to me'. 

Pastor Erick Hoskin, of Word of God Christian Fellowship Church, said the marriage was a great Christmas gift for the family.
