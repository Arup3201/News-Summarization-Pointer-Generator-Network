Lieutenant Joe P. Kennedy, who died when the American bomber he was piloting blew up over East Anglia in August 1944

Residents in a quiet English village are calling for a permanent memorial to the older brother of JFK who had been tipped as a future US president but died in a plane crash. 

Lieutenant Joe P Kennedy, the brother of John F Kennedy, had been at the controls of an American bomber flying over Blythburgh in Suffolk in August 1944 after taking off from RAF Fersfield.

The navy pilot had been on a top secret mission named Operation Anvil, which aimed to target German forces in northern France.

But the aircraft, packed with 21,000lbs of explosives blew up killing all on board and the remains of the crew were never found.

Lieutenant Kennedy's death hit the family hard, particularly his father Joe Kennedy Senior, who was said to have been grooming him to be the first Irish Catholic U.S. president.

After his death, the former American ambassador to the UK, then started pinning his hopes on his second son John, who eventually became the 35th president of the United States in January 1961.

No memorial or has ever been put up in the village and there is no grave for the former pilot and now local military groups are calling for a simple tribute.

Huby Fairfield, curator at Norfolk and Suffolk Aviation Musuem at Flixton told the Times: 'If someone doesn't do something soon he will be forgotten.

'He gave his life for his country and ours - he didn't have to take part in the operation, he volunteered.'

It is thought that the crash had been caused by a lack of electrical shielding and Lieutenant Kennedy was posthumously awarded the the Navy Cross, the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal.

It is also understood that JFK later visited the crash site of where his brother died.  

The crash was the first of a series of tragedies in the Kennedy clan's history dubbed the 'Kennedy curse'.

In 1948, Kathleen Kennedy was killed in an air crash and in 1963, John F. Kennedy, who was president at the time was assassinated leaving the nation bereft.

Just six months later in June 1964, a plane carrying JFK's youngest brother Senator Edward 'Ted' Kennedy crashed, killing the pilot and a political aide.

The senator was pulled from the wreckage and spent weeks recovering from a broken back, punctured lung and internal bleeding.

On June 6, 1968, Senator Robert F Kennedy, Robert Jr's father, was assassinated by a shooter in LA following his victory in the Californian presidential primary.

Then in 1999, John F. Kennedy Jr, the little boy known as John-John who symbolised a nation's mourning as he stood at his father's coffin in Arlington Cemetery, was killed when a small plane he was flying crashed into the Atlantic, close to the family's Martha's Vineyard compound.

His wife Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy and his sister-in-law Lauren Bessette were also killed in the crash.
