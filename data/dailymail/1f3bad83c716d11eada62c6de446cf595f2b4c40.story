Growing out long hair while keeping it in good condition is always a challenge.

Now stylist Arsen Gurgov of the Lous Licari Salon in New York is cutting hair with 'hot scissors' that heat up to 310 degrees, the New York Daily News reports.

Mr Gurgov claims that while regular scissors can cause hair to look frizzy and dry by opening the cuticle, the Jaguar TC Thermocut System shears seal the ends of hair to trap moisture inside.

Cutting edge: Temperatures can reach over 310 degrees in a hot scissor haircut, but stylists say that clients can not feel the heat

At first glance, the slim, lightweight
German-made scissors look like regular barber's shears - except for the 
small black box used to adjust the temperature.

Mr Gurgov says that hot scissors work best on fine, 
frizzy hair because they smooth ragged ends, making hair look and feel 
more voluminous.

Stylists adjust the temperature from around 270 degrees for fine hair to up to 310 for coarse locks. In general, the greater the damage, the higher stylists crank up the dial.

But the temperature isn't the only thing 
that rises: At Louis Licari, hot scissor cuts cost $350, compared to 
$145 for regular cuts.

Hot hair: Stylists say that haircuts with heated scissors can eliminate split ends

Mr Gurgov says that he spent a month 
researching new developments in the hair tool industry and had to go on 
an international scavenger hunt to find the scissors.

'I knew about people in Germany who were actually able to 
get these scissors for a while, and I just couldn’t get them,' he tells the paper.

'I went to 
Moscow, to England, and I found a guy who was able to access the 
Germans.'

Despite the high temperatures,  stylists say that clients can't feel the heat because the scissors heat up like a curling iron.

Experts say that they are a good option for people not willing to 
sacrifice their length to repair damage.

But while the shears can keep the haircut looking good for several weeks, they can't permanently cure split ends.
