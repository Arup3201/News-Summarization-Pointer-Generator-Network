Rumours Apple is on the verge of launching a larger screen iPhone have been circling for months, and now leaked slides reveal exactly why the firm may be looking to this new market.

In short, it’s because that’s where the money is.

The slides were used by Samsung as part of the current court battle in California between the two rival phone makers, and were published by website Re/Code.

They were taken from an Apple planning meeting from April 2013 that plotted the rise in popularity of larger screens, compared to a drop in iPhone growth.

The slides, pictured, were revealed by Samsung as part of the current court battle in California. They date back to an Apple planning meeting from April 2013. According to one slide, pictured, the smartphone market recently grew by 228 million units. Of this increase, 159 million units were larger, cheaper phones

Reports claim Apple will introduce a new 4.7-inch iPhone alongside a larger 5.5-inch model later this year.

The claims are said to have come from sources inside Apple’s supply chain.

Apple’s display suppliers, including Sharp and LG, and expected to go into mass production as early as this month.

Apple's iPhone 6 is also rumoured to come in a slim 'Air' version.

Up until August last year, Huawei was the record-holder for the thinnest phone in the world with its Ascend P6, at 6.18mm.

This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 5.75mm.

By comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 7.6mm, while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 7.5mm.

Samsung's Galaxy S4 is 7.9mm thick.

On one slide, Apple accused its rivals of spending an ‘obscene’ amount of money on advertising, and claimed consumers want what Apple doesn’t have.

Elsewhere, Apple admitted the strongest demand from consumers was coming from ‘less expensive and larger screen smartphones.’

It continued that its competitors have ‘drastically improved their hardware and in some cases their ecosystems.’

According to the slides, between 2011 and 2012, the smartphone market grew by 228 million units.

Of this increase, 159 million units were phones with screens larger than 4-inches, that cost less than $300 (£181).

Larger phones that cost more than $300 (£181) equated to 91 million units, and there was a drop of 22 million units in every other sector.

By comparison, Apple’s growth rates since 2009 to 2013 are shown as dropping from 107 per cent down to 8 per cent.

The $2billion court case began on 
March 31. Apple is accusing rival Samsung of infringing a number of 
software patents on the iPhone.

It is the latest battle between the two firms dating back to 2010.

Apple began by suing Samsung, but the Korean firm counter-sued just 
days later.

Apple then secured an injunction to restrict sales of 
Samsung’s Galaxy Tab 10.1 in Europe.

In
 July 2012, another court battle led to Apple publicly stating Samsung 
didn’t copy its designs, but in August 2012 Apple was awarded $1billion 
in damages.

In June 2013, the International Trade Commission ruled iPads infringed on Samsung patents and the products should be banned in the U.S.

This ruling was vetoed two months later when ITC blocked older Samsung phones.

A retrial began in November last year and Apple won, but Samsung appealed.

Apple did hit back, claiming Samsung had copied a number of its touchscreen gestures including its slide-to-unlock feature.

Samsung reportedly said Apple’s software was ‘fun’ and evoked emotion, while Samsung’s was unappealing to its owners.

Earlier this month, Japanese magazine MacFan published drawings of what seemed to be a 4.7-inch and 5.7-inch iPhone 6C, pictured. The drawings feature a flat, bezel-free device with rectangle-shaped volume controls like those found on the current iPhone 5C, as well as a camera with a single LED-flash on the rear

Recent concept images by designer Martin Hajek, pictured, and Italian artists Enrico Penello and Ran Avni feature a curved screen with 'bumps' at the top and bottom, along with an illuminated Touch ID sensor used to recognise fingerprints, first introduced on the iPhone 5S
