It seems the idea of granny struggling to send a text is well and truly outdated.

A survey has revealed that Britain is actually a nation of IAPs â€“ Internet Age Pensioners â€“ who think nothing of talking to friends on Skype, watching YouTube or uploading pictures on Facebook.

The study of 600 over-60s by retirement property developer McCarthy & Stone found that more than half of pensioners are comfortable with downloading apps, while nearly one in ten silver surfers are using dating sites.

They are also happy to back up their 
PC with security software and think nothing of syncing their iPhones, or
 uploading pictures on Facebook.

Half of those polled own tablets and 47 per cent have smartphones. Three-quarters own a laptop and 61 per cent a PC.

Research deals/utility quotes (88 per cent)

Research days out           (82 per cent)

Booked a holiday            (81 per cent)

Online banking (78 per cent)

Buy clothes (75 per cent)

Read online newspapers (72 per cent)

Get recipes (72 per cent)

Watch catch-up TV (69 per cent)

Bid on auction sites (61 per cent)

Book flights (61 per cent)

Research cars (61 per cent)

Look for properties (60 per cent)

Book train tickets (57 per cent)

Instant messaging (54 per cent)

Grocery shopping (47 per cent)

Order a repeat prescription (33 per cent)

Booked a hire car (32 per cent)

Booked an appointment (30 per cent)

Online dating (eight per cent)

And 96 per cent said they are far more savvy with technology than five years ago â€“ with 88 per cent describing themselves as fairly competent.

Bank books are also a thing of the past, as more than three-quarters (78 per cent) use the internet to do their banking online.

Some 72 per cent read their daily news online and 88 per cent used the internet to research deals and utility quotes or days out.

Other activities tackled online include buying clothes, find recipes, watching catch-up TV and bidding on auction sites.

Ali Crossley, Executive Director of McCarthy & Stone, said: 'There is a perception retirees are less in touch when it comes to technology, but that really isn't the case anymore.

'Many of the over 60s worked in careers which involved being savvy and up to date with the latest technology.

'You have to keep up with modern modes of communication if you want to keep in touch with the younger generation - many of the respondents used social networking sites to keep tabs on their children and grandchildren.

'The image of Granny struggling to send a text is really a thing of the past, with millions of pensioners logging on to Facebook and Twitter accounts daily.'

Nearly 40 per cent of the respondents said they use social media to keep in touch with friends and 35 per cent with family.

More than half said they use Facebook, while YouTube is used by 41 per cent, Skyping or instant messaging by 23 per cent, iTunes by 19 per cent and Twitter by 18 per cent.

Nearly two thirds of the older generation said their adult children encouraged them to be knowledgeable when it comes to technology to stay 'with it.'
