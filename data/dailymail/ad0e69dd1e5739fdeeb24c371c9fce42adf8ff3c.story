As preparations for Easter begin, Nestle has come up with a new way of harnessing the appeal of the Easter bunny. 

The confectionery giant has launched special edition apple pie and carrot flavour Kit Kats for the Japanese market.

Nestle came up with the idea after it surveyed Japanese chocolate fans and found apple and carrot were the flavours that most would like to see.

The Japanese arm of Nestle has launched an apple pie and carrot flavour Kit Kat in the country for Easter 

The idea has proved so popular apple pie and carrot flavour Kit Kats have now gone into production in time for Easter. 

The chocolate sweet made by Nestle has existed as a product since the 1920s and is now sold all over the world.

Versions of KitKats sold in Japan are well-known for being different to the main product sold elsewhere in the world with limited editions often made available for Christmas and Halloween.

The carrot flavoured KitKat is the firm's first attempt at coming up with a product for the Easter market. 

The new Kit Kat was created after Japanese customers were asked for their favourite flavour combinations

In special versions of the chocolate there will be limited editions, featuring a bunny and Easter message 

The treats went on sale from today and are priced at 540 yen (£3) for a pack of 12. 

For the first time in the company's 42-year history in Japan they will use a bunny

A spokesman for Nestle said: "We will have 13 different designs, so anybody who wants to collect all the labels may have to buy more than one packet."

He said in addition every 30th chocolate bar would have a limited special edition design for collectors.

Kit Kats are extremely popular in Japan, with novelty forms such as Special Chilli already being sold 

Kit Kats are considered lucky In Japan and Tokyo already has its own chocolatory for special flavours 

Japan is no stranger to novelty forms of KitKat. 

Last year the confectionery giant launched bake-ready versions of the snack which can either be baked and eaten or consumed raw. 

Other flavours included Sublime Bitter, Special Sakura Green Tea and Special Chilli.

Tokyo has its own KitKat Chocolatory in Seibu Department Store in Ikebukuro which produces limited edition versions of the snack, considered lucky in Japan.
