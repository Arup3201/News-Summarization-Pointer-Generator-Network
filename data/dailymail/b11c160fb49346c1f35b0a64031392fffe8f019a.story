Rielle Hunter, the former mistress of disgraced senator John Edwards, is set to give an explosive interview where she will spill the details of their love affair which shattered his presidency dreams, ended his marriage and culminated in a political corruption trial.

She will open up about the state of her relationship with the former North Carolina Senator and his relationship with the couple's four-year-old daughter Quinn.

Dressed in a short, printed dress with bare legs and wedge heels, 48-year-old Ms Hunter was pictured for the first time being interviewed on ABC's 20/20. The show will air next Friday, June 22. 

Revelations: John Edwards' former mistress Rielle Hunter is set to speak publicly for the first time on June 22 about their relationship since the disgraced senator was found not guilty of illegally accepting campaign funds

She will also talk about what she would have said if called as a witness in Edwards' trial.

Her book What Really Happened: John Edwards, Our Daughter, and Me hits the shelves four days later on June 26 when she will make further scheduled TV appearances on ABC.

It is being billed as the tell-all behind the love affair.

On May 31, John Edwards was acquitted of one count of corruption
and a U.S District Court judge ruled a mistrial on five other 
counts.

Outside court, Edwards addressed the media to take responsibility for his sins and personally mentioned Quinn saying: 'My precious Quinn, who I love more than any of you can ever imagine, who I am so close to, so, so grateful for.'

Rielle Hunter was not called to give 
evidence in the trial and she has not spoken about her affair with 
Edwards and their child Frances Quinn since an interview with GQ in 
2010.

She told the magazine at that time: 
'I know he loves me. I have never had any doubt at all about that. We 
love each other very much.

'And that hasn't changed, and I believe that 
will be till death do us part. The love doesn't go away. It's 
unconditional.'

Originally hired as a videographer for the Edwards presidential campaign, Rielle Hunter started a romantic relationship with ‘Johnny’ while the two were on the road.

Her own personal narrative is as 
fascinating as the ensuing campaign scandal: her father was involved in 
the death of her show horse when she was a young girl.

She then became a muse for 
Manhattan’s 90s literary scene and author Jay McInerney based a 
‘cocaine-addled, sexually voracious’ character on Hunter.

By the time she met Edwards in a New York hotel bar in 2006, she was a convert of new age philosophies and mysticism.

She walked up to him, said, 'You’re so hot', and ended the conversation 
by passing him her business card which read: 'Rielle Hunter: Being is 
free'.

After the pair began their romantic partnership, she became pregnant and agreed with the plan to have Edwards’ long-time aide Andrew Young claim paternity in an effort to keep Edwards’ political prospects alive.

Until now, no one has heard her full version of events after she did not testify during Edwards' trial.

Though he was acquitted, the trial exposed a sordid sex scandal that unfolded while Edwards' wife Elizabeth was dying of cancer.

In the end, prosecutors couldn't convince jurors that the ex-U.S. senator and 2004 vice presidential candidate masterminded a $1 million cover-up of his affair.
