There will be a fresh sense of optimism in and around the Emirates on Saturday lunchtime as Arsenal take on Manchester City in the latest blockbuster Premier League clash.

The sight of Danny Welbeck, their £16m deadline-day signing from Manchester United, scoring twice for England in their Euro 2016 opener with Switzerland will have gladdened the hearts of the Arsenal faithful. 

The striker looks revitalised by a change of surroundings and a new challenge, ready to feed off the ammunition supplied to him by Alexis Sanchez, Aaron Ramsey, Santi Cazorla and Mesut Ozil.

Arsene Wenger knows Arsenal's record against the big clubs must improve if they are to sustain a Premier League title challenge - they have collected just 26 points from 90 against the top four over the last five years

In terms of craft and creativity, there are few midfields in the top flight that can match the one Arsenal now boast - at least on paper.

But in order to return the title to north London for the first time in a decade, there is one thing that must change, starting this weekend.

Arsenal's recent record against their title rivals is very poor; their last 30 matches against their fellow incumbents in the top four have yielded just seven wins and 18 defeats.

They have collected a meagre 26 points out of a possible 90 during this five-year period against the big boys.

Arsenal also suffered humiliation at the hands of Liverpool, losing 5-1 at Anfield last season

Arsenal have finished in the top four for each the last five Premier League seasons, unlike their rivals Chelsea, Man United, Man City and Liverpool, who have all had at least one season outside the Champions League places. 

But even with just 30 matches played against their rivals, their points-per-game ratio is the worst. Chelsea have fared best in the big games, winning 17 out of 32 against teams that finished that season in the top four. 

One thing that might cheer up Arsenal fans is that their rivals Spurs have a worse record in the big games...

The TV companies have not done Arsenal a favour in scheduling their match with Manchester City for 12.45pm. 

The Gunners' biggest beatings last season - 3-6 at City, 1-5 at Liverpool and 0-6 at Chelsea - were all 12.45pm starts. 

It is this inability to beat their nearest challengers on a regular basis that is making the difference between finishing first and finishing fourth, and Arsene Wenger knows he need to address it.

Last season was a prime example - Arsenal were flying high when goals from Cazorla and Ramsey saw off Liverpool at the Emirates in November and it genuinely looked like their year.

But things quickly unravelled. They were thumped 6-3 by Manchester City, 5-1 by Liverpool and 6-0 by Chelsea away from home, ultimately finishing fourth - enough to secure Champions League football for the 17th consecutive season but a disappointing return given they led the table until February.

The season before, they failed to pick up a win against Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea - the three sides who finished above them. In 2011-12, they were thrashed 8-2 at Old Trafford and also lost on the road to rivals Tottenham and City.

These defeats in big matches are disastrous and have been going on too long. The fear factor must be overcome and there's no time like the present to make the change.

Arsenal face City on Saturday, play Tottenham at home on September 27 and then travel to Chelsea on October 5. This is a team packed with quality, they need to make a big statement against their title rivals.
