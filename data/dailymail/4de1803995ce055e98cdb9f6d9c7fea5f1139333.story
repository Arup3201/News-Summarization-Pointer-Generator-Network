Simon Cowell's pregnant, married lover Lauren Silverman is set to get a share of the multi-million dollar pre-nup she signed before marrying Andrew Silverman - despite breaking a cheating clause.

The 36-year-old socialite, who is expecting a baby with the music mogul, has held 'productive conversations' with her estranged husband as they continue to thrash out their divorce agreement.

And the couple- who spent the weekend locked in talks at their rental home in the Hamptons - are also working on plans to share custody of their seven-year-old son Adam.

Today, a source told MailOnline: 'There have been productive conversations over the weekend.

'Lauren and Andrew are intent on resolving this - and Simon also wants it resolved.'

As MailOnline revealed, the X Factor 
supremo, 53, jetted out of Los Angeles on Friday, watching his band One 
Direction in concert in Las Vegas on Saturday night before heading to 
Europe, where he will spend the month on board the Slipstream yacht, 
touring St Tropez.

He 
is believed to want to give his lover space in order to work out her 
divorce case. If the case is settled somewhat amicably, then it will 
avoid an ugly court battle, in which Cowell could be dragged into - and 
any embarrassing secrets exposed.

The
 New York Post reported that Lauren waited until her 10th wedding 
anniversary to break the news of her affair with Cowell to her husband 
so the terms of her pre-nup would kick in.

And
 a source again insisted today that Lauren tried to 'max out her return 
by stringing things along past the 10 year mark to increase what she 
would be eligible to receive.

Lauren today appeared outside the Bridgehampton home where she is staying with her husband and son.

The striking brunette, wearing a sweatshirt and baseball cap, smiled as her son was picked up for summer camp.

She then headed to lunch with a friend in nearby Southampton, where she had donned a clingy striped sun dress, with a black bikini top underneath.

Lauren is now being represented by Bernard Clair - named as one of '10 lawyers you don't want representing your spouse in a divorce' - by Business Insider.

Mr Clair famously represented socialite Jocelyn Wildenstein in her divorce from Alec Nathan Wildensteain, New York designer Carolyn Roehm, and Republican fundraiser Georgette Mosbacher.

While Andrew Silverman is being represented Jeffrey Cohen of Cohen Goldstein Silpe. As previously revealed, his parents Eleanora and Allen refused to attend the wedding in 2003 in the fabulously elegant old-money confines of the St Regis hotel in Manhattan’s Midtown.

According to a friend, the Silvermans 'did not approve of the relationship, they didn't have a good feeling about Lauren and the relationship.'

Lauren did her utmost to take her mind off her situation over
 the weekend, as she headed out for a spot of retail therapy.

She wore a fitted yellow minidress as she was joined by her sister 
and son Adam as the group browsed the local shops in Bridgehampton, New 
York.

Lauren's outing 
came as Cowell headed to St Tropez, where he is expected to spend the 
next month alongside ex-girlfriends including Sinitta.

Cowell will 
tour Europe and take time to evaluate how exactly to proceed after it 
was revealed last week that New York socialite Lauren - married to his 
friend Andrew - is expecting his baby.

Ironically,
 it was on board the $458,000-a-week Slipstream that Cowell was pictured
 sharing a tender embrace with Lauren last August, in images that came 
to light last week.

Despite the St Tropez trip, Cowell is also expected to fly to 
Britain within the next few days to meet up with his 87-year-old mother Julie and brother 
Nick to discuss the pregnancy and his plans for the future.

Prior to heading to St Tropez, Cowell
 was seen taking his mind off the drama in his personal life by 
attending a One Direction concert in Las Vegas on Saturday night.

He was spotted mingling 
with fans, standing alongside a male friend, as he stood in the audience
 and watched his X Factor stars perform in the city - while his lover stayed on the East Coast.

A
 friend close to Andrew Silverman told the New York Post that the idea that he 
knew about his wife's relationship with Cowell is 'ridiculous' and 'she 
knows this isn't true.'

Lauren's accusations that her husband
 messed around, partying with girls all over the world, is only adding 
fuel to their bitter custody battle over son Adam.

Andrew's friend said that it sounds like a 'desperate attempt to smear him.'

The statement was in response to an earlier TMZ report that said Andrew knew about the affair all along.

They
 said Lauren was 'outraged' that when he feigned shock at pictures of 
the Hamptons socialite kissing Simon on a yacht last year.

The
 website reported that Lauren has alleged to close friends that Andrew 
'knew what was going on the whole time and he was doing the same thing.'

While
 Lauren's pregnancy is still in early days, Cowell is said to be 
concerned about the strain the situation and publicity could put on the 
socialite.

The
 pair are in a relationship, as MailOnline revealed, but 
another friend said: 'At the moment, Lauren and Andrew need to thrash 
out their divorce - Lauren can't just go running off to be with Simon, 
as much as she wants to be with him.

'All sides want the divorce to go through as quickly as can be.'

It remains to be seen just how the 
news that he is to be a father will go down with Cowell, who has never 
made a secret of the fact that he doesn't believe he is the right 
material to become a parent.

In an interview in 2009, Cowell said: 'God, no. I couldn't have children. If I had them here drawing on the walls I'd go nuts.

'With
 kids, you've got a routine you can't escape from. You've got to be up 
at a certain time. Got to listen. When all you want to do is sit in a 
corner thinking.'

However,
 in a more recent interview in April this year, Cowell appeared to have 
somewhat changed his mind, saying: 'I haven’t ruled it out. If I knew I 
could be - how do I put this delicately - faithful, I would.

'I do like kids, I’m just not sure I’d 
be any good for the first six months. I don’t think I’d adopt because 
I’d rather have my own. I’d have to say I’d like a little girl.'
