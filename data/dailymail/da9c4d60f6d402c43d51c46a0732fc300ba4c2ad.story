Cristiano Ronaldo may have just won the Ballon d'Or for the second successive year in a row, but has the Real Madrid ace lost his trophy girlfriend?

The Portuguese star has reportedly been dumped by Russian beauty Irina Shayk, his partner of four years.

The 29-year-old supermodel was not in attendance as Ronaldo collected the award in Zurich on Monday, the third of his career.

And there was also no mention of the Russian in the Real Madrid striker's acceptance speech, meaning rumours of their break up is rife.

The duo were both in attendance when Ronaldo won the award last year, with the happy couple taking to social media afterwards to celebrate his achievements with fans.

However, this time round there was no words of congratulations from Irina, instead she is even believed to have unfollowed the former Manchester United man on Twitter.

Just weeks ago the Russian model fell out with Ronaldo’s mum over Christmas plans and it looks as though she may finally have had enough.

The couple have been together for the past four years, but it seems there may be trouble in paradise with rumours circulating that she had dumped the Real Madrid man.

There was no words of congratulations from Irna, just pictures of the beach posted to her social networks
