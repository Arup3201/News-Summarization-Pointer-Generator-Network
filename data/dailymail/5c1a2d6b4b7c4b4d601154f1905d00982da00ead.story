A taxi driver has told how he chauffeured a ‘relaxed and happy’ Michaella McCollum Connolly and Melissa Reid around Lima as they spent hundreds of pounds on shoes, clothes and jewellery in a three-day spree.

Martin Huaroto works for the hotel where the girls stayed. He told The Mail on Sunday they did not seem anxious at the prospect of being forced to be drug mules and even found time for a once-in-a-lifetime sightseeing trip.

The driver, 45, employed by the Hotel San Augustin Colonial, said: ‘The girls arrived in Peru and immediately got a flight to Cusco where they spent two days taking in the  awe-inspiring sights of the Andes.

A taxi driver has said Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly (pictured being held in Peru) did not seem anxious at the prospect of being forced to be drug mules

‘When they got back they checked into the hotel and told the staff all about their trip. They said they had a fantastic time and seemed incredibly relaxed and happy – not at all as if they had the world on their shoulders.

‘They hired me for three days and I took them on expensive shopping trips where they came back loaded with bags.

‘We went to the Plaza de Armas and Larcomar – both famous for their high-end shops. When they returned they were carrying so many bags it was difficult to get them into the car.

‘There were shoes and lots of clothes and some jewellery. They stuck together the whole time and there were no other men with them, just like regular holidaymakers.

‘I thought they must be really spoilt because they bought so much. When I saw them on the news I could not believe it – they had gone from being on expensive shopping trips in my cab to holed up in a dirty cell.

‘It’s very common for girls to be talked into coming to Peru by flash gangsters. They are promised free drugs, money, a holiday and accommodation. When they get caught out the world comes from beneath them.’

A source at the police station said: ‘The cells are a very difficult place to be, even for hardened criminals, so it can tell you a lot.

‘Michaella and Melissa have been laughing, and even singing songs like You’re Just Too Good To Be True. It’s the same old story we have heard a million times.

‘They were just stupid, allowed themselves to get in a situation and got caught. Now they have to deal with the consequences.’

The pair were arrested at Lima's Jorge Chavez airport while trying to board a flight to Madrid
