Some of Greece's most-cherished archaeological sites are to be opened up to advertising firms and other commercial ventures.

In a move bound to leave many Greeks and scholars aghast, Greece's culture ministry said it was taking the measure to help with the upkeep of the debt-stricken country's ancient ruins.

The ministry said the move was 'a common-sense way' of helping 'facilitate' access to the venues.

Archaeologists have for decades slammed such an initiative as sacrilege. But the culture ministry has tried to calm fears by saying that strict conditions will be imposed on anyone wanting to rent the sites.

According to a ministerial briefing dating from the end of December, a commercial firm could rent the Acropolis for a professional photographic shoot for as little as 1,600 euros per day.

Demonstrators could also rent the ancient landmark. Greece needs every euro it can get. The country's public coffers are drained and the nation is struggling to avoid a historic debt default in March.

Greece was bailed out in May 2010 by the European Union and International Monetary Fund and is in the process of nailing down a second rescue, though it is undergoing tough talks with private creditors to reduce its massive debt mountain.

Commercial use of Greece's archaeological sites has until now been the responsibility of the Central Council of Archaeology, which has been very choosy about who gains access.

In recent decades, only a select few people, including Greek-Canadian filmmaker Nia Vardalos and the American director Francis Ford Coppola, have been able to use the Acropolis, while most filming and advertising requests have been refused.
