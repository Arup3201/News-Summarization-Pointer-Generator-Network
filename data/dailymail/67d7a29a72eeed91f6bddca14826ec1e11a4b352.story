Manchester City star Yaya Toure has been revealed as one of three players nominated to win the African Footballer of the Year award.

Lille goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama and Dortmund striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang make up the final contingent. 

A longer list involving 25 players was announced in November but that has now been whittled down.

Yaya Toure has been revealed as one of three players nominated to win the African Player of the Year Award

Toure has won the award three times before, he scored 24 goals last season for City in all competitions

Toure, a three-time winner of the award, had an exceptional season as City won the Premier League in 2013-14, scoring 24 goals as Manuel Pellegrini brought home the title in his first season in England.

He also played all three of the Ivory Coast's matches at the World Cup in Brazil. 

Aubameyang, meanwhile, scored 14 goals last season as Dortmund finished runners-up in the Bundesliga behind Bayern Munich. 

Enyeama helped guide Lille to a third-placed finish in Ligue 1 and also captained Nigeria at the World Cup in Brazil.
