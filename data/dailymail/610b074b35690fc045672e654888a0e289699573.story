Neil Taylor is a target for West Bromwich Albion as Tony Pulis looks to strengthen his left-back options.

But Pulis will likely battle with his former club Crystal Palace over the signature as Alan Pardew is also keen on the 25-year-old.

Taylor is entering the final 18 months of his contract at Swansea City and Garry Monk is said to be searching the market for left backs, suggesting a deal could be done this window.

Pulis has been unconvinced by Sebastien Pocognoli, preferring to start Chris Baird in the win over Hull City, and is keen to do extensive business in January.

Palace have been desperate for a natural left back with Joel Ward and Martin Kelly asked to cover their weaker flank frequently this season.

Taylor, who has 20 Wales caps, has been a regular for Swansea this season after Ben Davies’ departure to Tottenham Hotspur.
