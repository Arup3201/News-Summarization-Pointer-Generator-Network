A Californian woman is suing Yosemite National Park for $3.5 million after contracting a deadly virus while vacationing there.

Cathy Carrillo fell ill with the hantavirus after visiting the iconic park in June last year - leaving her unable to talk or walk and confining her to hospital for three weeks of treatment in critical care.

One year later, Carrillo still has reduced lung capacity and problems communicating, caused she says, by the deadly disease which is spread through the inhalation of rodent feces.

Cathy Carrillo of Chino Hills was among the nine confirmed cases of people who became ill with the hantavirus. Three of them died.

Investigators discovered that mice were living in the double-walled tents at Yosemite - which have since been changed to single wall tents along with 18,000 mouse traps and hantavirus warnings.

'I couldn't walk at all, I couldn't move my arms or anything,' said Cathy Carrillo to ABC News 7.

'The doctors at the hospital said I was a miracle because they didn't know if I was going to pull through.'

Carillo and her husband and son stayed at Yosemite's Curry Village tents in June of last year - falling ill two days after she returned home.

'I started getting chills and fever, so I just assumed I had the flu,' she said.

Having come down with the hantavirus, which can cause irregular heart beats and kidney failure, Carillo was hospitalized.

'The virus is in the waste and it becomes aerosol, and it's breathed in and that's what happens, it comes in through the lungs,' said her attorney Mark Algorria.

'Most people die of this illness, it's a very severe illness.'

The hantavirus has a mortality rate of 30 percent and during a 2011 outbreak in the park this increased to 50 percent.

Yosemite officials confirmed that the virus Carilllo caught did originate in the Curry Village and now Carillo and her husband are suing the Delaware North Company who maintain the parks resorts, for negligence.

According to Algorri, the Delaware North Company knew about the virus as far back as 2008.

'They've known about it, they did not warn about it, and they did not maintain this premise, the park, in a safe condition,' he said to ABC News 7.

The Delaware North Company said that it would not comment on the pending litigation but released an email to ABC News 7.

Following the outbreak Yosemite handed out leaflets informing visitors of the potential threat of the hantavirus

'All the Yosemite Valley cases of hantavirus were associated with a double-wall, insulated tent cabin design, which have all been removed.'

The lawsuit against Delaware North Companies Parks & Resorts at Yosemite claims the defendants acted in a conscious and reckless disregard for the rights and safety of others.

Attorney Mark Algorri said, 'The fact they knew about it, really didn't warn about it. The Carrillos went up there, been up there, never knew this problem existed. It was really kept on the down low.'

Cathy says she still suffers from fatigue and diminished lung capacity. She adds it's been especially tough for her husband and kids.

The next move for this Yosemite Hantavirus lawsuit is the scheduling 
conference. It is set for July 23rd in U.S. district court in Fresno.
