When thinking of scary types of dogs, one might imagine an American Pit Bull Terrier or a Rottweiler.

Which is why a Washington state woman is struggling to understand how her tiny Shih Tzu 'Lucky' could be seen as a 'monster', after receiving a letter from UPS saying the little guy is a danger to mail carrier workers.

The letter went on to say that if Sun Moon, of North Spokane, didn't relocate her mail box to the fence line, UPS would stop delivering her letters, according to KREM 2.

Vicious?: UPS have complained this dog, Lucky, poses a safety risk to workers delivering mail in North Spokane, Washington, according to the Shih Tzu's owner

'He's not a monster,' Moon told the network.

'He's not a mean puppy. This dog is very friendly, very likeable.'

'We never had a problem. Also, he never bite anybody.'

UPS have sent three letters of complaint to Moon, she says.

The third was the one that threatened to stop deliveries.

A customer relations coordinator for the local U.S. Postal Service said that no serious incident had been reported, but that Lucky was often on the loose in the yard and frighten workers when they have to walk through the gate.

'It's not about (the dog) being vicious, it's about it being loose,' the spokesperson, Robbin Darst, told KREM 2.

'So we have to treat everybody the same.

'One of our largest safety issues (we face) is dog bites.'

'They need to put a forward in from their street address so we can forward the mail to their P.O. Box and the whole issue is solved.'

UPS have asked Moon to move her mail box from the door to the fence line

'One of our largest safety issues (we face) is dog bites.'

'They need to put a forward in from their street address so we can forward the mail to their P.O. Box and the whole issue is solved.'

Moon said she has tried to redirect her mail to a PO Box but that she stopped receiving things.

She doesn't want to move her mail box to the street because she fears letters will be stolen.

The dispute is ongoing.
