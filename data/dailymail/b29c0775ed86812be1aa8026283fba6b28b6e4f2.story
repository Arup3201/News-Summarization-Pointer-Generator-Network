Victoria's Environment Protection Agency had no previous cases to base its response to maintain air-quality as a six-week fire ravaged the Hazelwood underground brown coal mine in a world-first.

The inquiry into the devastating coal mine fire is into its second week.

Morwell - the town near the mine - was covered in smoke and ash for 45 days as the fire burned, with residents reporting headaches, nose bleeds and ash blanketing their homes like snow.

The Hazelwood coal mine fire started on February 9 and burned for six weeks

Some residents were told to evacuate their homes.

On Monday, the inquiry heard Victoria's Environment Protection Agency was ill-informed about how to respond to the mine fire, AAP reported.

The agency was called two days after the fire started in the open-cut brown coal mine on February 11.

Chief executive at the time of the fire John Merritt said the agency had never been called to mine fires and was not an emergency air-monitoring agency.

Victoria's Environment Protection Agency said it did not have anything to base its response to the air quality because the situation was a world first

'It was simply without precedent that we would have this sort of event of this sort of duration ... that would warrant the emergency readiness of mobile air-monitoring equipment,' he said.

Mr Merritt went on to tell the inquiry that the EPA started transmitting data from a 24-hour reading on February 14.

But counsel assisting the inquiry Melinda Richards said there was a week-long gap between air quality data recorded at East Morwell on February 12 and data recorded at Morwell South - where conditions were reported to be more severe.

The inquiry into the Hazelwood fire is into its second week and the final report will be handed down at the end of August

Mr Merritt indicated the brown coal mine fire burning for so long was a world first and the EPA had nowhere to draw experience from after the Victorian Government's lawyer Josh Wilson asked him if this was the case.

'For all the wrong reasons this particular mine fire was a world's first in terms of prolonged adverse air quality," Mr Wilson said.

Mr Merritt agreed and said 'Previous fires had led us into a false sense of the impact of a mine fire on the town.'

He said there was no historical basis before February 9 to indicate it would have been useful to have air-monitoring labs on hand.

Country Fire Authority firefighters have told the inquiry that when they arrived they were locked out of the site

Mr Merritt also added the agency responded as quickly as it could.

'I don't believe we could have acted any faster than we did,' he said.

The inquiry has also heard efforts to stop the fire were marred with communication issues.

On Thursday, volunteer firefighter Doug Steley told the inquiry Country Fire Authority (CFA) crews had trouble getting into the Hazelwood mine when they first arrived because the gate was locked, and weren't told where to go and weren't given proper information on how to operate carbon monoxide monitors.

7,000 people were looked at for carbon monoxide poisoning in relation to the fire, with 23 WorkCover claims filed

During the fire, some residents in the town of Morwell - that has about 125,000 people - were evacuated

The Herald Sun reported the inquiry heard the fire's health monitoring was the largest of its kind in the world - with 7,000 people looked at for carbon monoxide poisoning and 23 WorkCover claims were filed. There were 14 firefighters who were taken to hospital with carbon monoxide poisoning while they battled the fire.

It also heard the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning from mine fires was known after an incident in 2006, but the Country Fire Authority had not yet put into place a 2010 draft operating procedure when the Hazelwood fire started.

The inquiry into the coal mine fire started on May 26 and will focus on its origin and the response effort.

The final report will be submitted to the Victorian Government at the end of August.
