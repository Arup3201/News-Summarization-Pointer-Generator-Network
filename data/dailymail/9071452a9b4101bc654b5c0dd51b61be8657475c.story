Twenty workers at a Quaker Oats plant in Iowa have claimed a $241 million winning Powerball ticket in Iowa's biggest jackpot prize to date.

Filing off a bus to present their winning ticket Wednesday afternoon the group of 20 workers in matching red t-shirts let out a loud cheer when submitting their ticket at the Des Moines headquarters.

'You're a winner!' the automatic machine replied to the group's all-around celebration.

'They're obviously having a great time,' lottery spokeswoman Mary Neubauer who welcomed the group from the plant's Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union told the Quad-City Times.

Purchasing the ticket on June 13 on behalf of the employees, the winnings will be split 20 ways, said Dan Morris, a spokesman for the group's union.

All from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Mr Morris said the winners are between 35 and 64 years old and arrived on a charted bus paid for by their union from Cedar Rapids to Des Moines.

'They’re in shock. Still trying to recover,' said Joe Day, the group’s lawyer.

Success: Inside the lottery headquarters the 20 men and women watch as their winning ticket is scanned and received as Iowa's biggest jackpot win to date

Mr Day said the group had yet to decide what to do with the winnings, but described the winners in one word: 'ecstatic.'

'Financial security for a lifetime,' he said. 'Anybody would want that.'

The jackpot is the 15th largest won by Powerball players in the country and, according to Ms Neubauer, would amount to roughly $5.6 million per person after taxes if the group chooses the lump-sum cash option.

Lottery officials told the Times that withholdings on the lump sum option - of $160.3 million - would amount to $40.1 million in federal taxes and $8 million in state.

After those taxes the group would be awarded $122.2 million in all.
