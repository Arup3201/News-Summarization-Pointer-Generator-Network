A new computer games controller that could be mistaken for a real gun is set for release early next year.

The Delta Six controller for video games like Call of Duty looks frighteningly similar to a genuine firearm, with its inventor claiming 'the only way to get more real is to enlist'.

Aimed at adult gamers, the device is intended to give players of First-Person Shooting (FPS) games a more immersive experience than has been possible so far.

However, the imminent release of the hyper-realistic add-on is bound to raise fears that computer games encourage violent behaviour among the young.

The hybrid controller incorporates all the controls of a standard joypad in a shell modelled on military grade assault weapons.

With
 a built-in accelerometer that its makers say can be used in any game 
without calibration, it aims like a real gun without the need for a 
receiver on top of the user's television set.

The controller also features a range of pressure switches, one of which can automatically switch the game to precision aiming mode by simply holding the device up to the user's cheek.

Other functions include a faux recoil simulation that makes it judder like it's spitting lead from the muzzle, and a real-life style reloading function in the gadget's magazine.

The device ships with a range of accessories that allow users to convert it from full-length sniper rifle to compact sub-machine gun, depending on their preferred style of play.

The Delta Six is the brainchild of David Kotkin, who is well known in gaming circles for his Avenger joypad mod.

He
 said: 'For the first time a Call of Duty player will feel more immersed
 in game-play and have more control over the game than ever before. The 
only way to get more real is to enlist.'

Mr
 Kotkin's company says preliminary testing has shown that the Delta Six 
is easier and faster to use than a standard controller for FPS-style 
games.

Features: 
The controller, which is expected to retail for $89, can be adapted to a
 range of configurations depending on the user's preferred style of play

'This wins against a reg controller, even with and Avenger adapter on it,' the inventor said. 'We're more excited about Delta Six than any other project to date.

'The Wii, and the Move tried but could not make a fun and innovative motion control for FPS games. So we had to.'

However, he adds: 'This is fun for adults, not for gamers younger than 21.' The Delta Six is expected to cost $89 (Â£55) when it launches early next year.
