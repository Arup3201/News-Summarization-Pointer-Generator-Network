The woman who fell 70 foot to her death when a San Francisco beauty spot collapsed into the sea on Saturday has been named as 58-year-old Nancy Blum.

Authorites said on Monday that Blum, together with an unnamed companion, had been hiking about 6:30 p.m. ‘when a structural collapse of the rock occurred’ at Point Reyes National Seashore.

After emergency personnel reached Blum and her companion, she was flown to Bear Valley Ranger Station, where she was pronounced dead.

The National Park Service and the county coroner's office are investigating the cause of Blum's death, reports SFGate.

'The cause of death will be pending the completion of toxicology studies,' the sheriff's office said in a statement.

Blum’s hiking companion continues to be treated for life-threatening injuries.

The two visitors were standing on the Arch Rock lookout point when the bluff gave way and the pair fell about 70 feet, winding up covered with rocks and debris.

The National Park Service had posted signs at the site on Thursday warning hikers that a fissure along the top of Arch Rock may have weakened the cliff and that walking along the edge was potentially dangerous.

The park did not close the trail and in spite of the warnings, one hiker who visited the park  told the San Francisco Chronicle that she had seen dozens of people walking in the area.

'It was clear no one should be on that rock with the huge fissure,' Karen Blasing said. 'We stayed back, but many others were unconcerned and dangerously taking chances.'

KBCW reports  that other park-goers scrambled to assist Blum and her companion before officials from Marin County fire, sheriff, and Park Rangers arrived.

A Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office carried the pair to the trailhead, where a medical chopper was waiting.
