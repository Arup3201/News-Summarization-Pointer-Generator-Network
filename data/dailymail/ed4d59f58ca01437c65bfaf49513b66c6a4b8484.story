A sickening photo has emerged social media showing a toddler kicking the severed head of a dead soldier in Syria.

The toddler's father is believed to be an avid Islamic State supporter and is wearing a camouflage military style baseball cap on his head. 

The father can be seen smiling with delight in the photo as he watches his innocent child kick the severed head.

Shocking photo has emerged showing a suspected ISIS supporter encouraging a toddler to kick the severed head of a dead soldier 

Leaning over, the bearded man, wearing a short white thoub, appears to be helping his young child to raise their small leg and kick the rotting head of the dead body. 

At least one person, wearing three quarter length jeans can be seen watching the horrific scene.

The severed head, which is too gruesome to show in full detail, appears to be several days old. 

It appears to be the head of a dead prisoner, although it is hard to distinguish his features due to the heavy decomposition of the face. 

The face has also suffered a deep wound, suggesting the victim had been militated with a knife.

The horrific photo comes just hours after 'Raqqa is being Slaughtered silently', a Syrian activist group based in the ISIS stronghold posted photos of the latest barbaric execution carried out by IS. 

A photo of children crowding around the body of a crucified and beheaded Syrian rebel member has emerged

The photo shows a crowd of young boys, standing around a wooden gallows. There appears to be at least ten boys in the photo, but few are focused on the gruelsome scene nearby. 

At the center of the photo is the body of a Syrian rebel member, who has been crucified and beheaded. 

It is believed he was the relative of Zahran Alloush, the renowned leader of Jaysh al-Islam, one of the groups which is part of the Islamic Front and fighting to form their own Islamic State in Syria.

Zahran Alloush shot to fame for surprising reasons in early July when Islamic Front released a video showing the imposing figure of Alloush delivering a rousing speech to denounce Islamic State. 

However, it was his notebook which attracted a bigger talking point rather than the words of his speech. 

On his desk, a Hello Kitty notebook appears to have been used by Alloush whilst making notes for his speech.

The Japanese brand, which celebrated its 40th birthday the other day, is better known to be the trusted diary for teenage girls rather than fearsome rebel leaders, leading many Islamic State supporters to mock Alloush on social media.

It is unknown exactly how closely related the dead prisoner in the photo was to Zahran Alloush. However due to the age of his body, it is likely he was possibly a distant, younger cousin. 

The photo shows how he was subjected to a brutal death as his arms are bound to the scaffolds in an outstretched crucifixion pose. 

The head has been severed from his body and placed on his lap, with blood still dripping from the open neck wound.

The horrific scene, which appears to have been openly witnessed by children, underlines the brutality of Islamic State. 

Their interpretation of Shari'a law has meant that public executions for crimes like 'cursing God' and 'sorcery' have become a fixture in the city's public square. 

Young boys appear to be openly encouraged to witness these appalling scenes without any consideration by adults.

'Raqqa is being slaughtered silently' has developed a reputation for providing a shocking insight into life in Raqqa. 

The secret activist group, whose members risk their lives to document the atrocities happening in the IS held city of Raqqa, have previously published other photos of public executions and general oppression. 

Several of the groups members have been imprisoned and executed, whilst attempting to document the crimes being carried out by Islamic State militants.
