The unnamed woman who was discovered in her home six months after she died

A television network and forensic cleaning company could face legal action after allegedly filming without permission inside the home of a Sydney woman who lay dead in her home for six months before being found.

Six month-old expired milk still in the fridge, the chair of unnamed woman fell off at the time of her death and even the remains of her scalp was just some of the graphic footage aired on the SBS current affairs show The Feed on Wednesday.

Following the broadcast, the NSW Trustee and Guardian, acting as executor of the woman’s will because she had no next of kin, claims there were no permission granted to film inside the home in Auburn, western Sydney.

The almost 90-year-old woman had been undiscovered for so long that when the film crew and forensic cleaner arrived that her body was decomposing through the floor boards.

Trustee chief executive Imelda Dodds told Fairfax Media the only permission approved was for Lee Iordanidis , the owner of a recently deregistered forensic cleaning company, to assess the cleaning job to give a quote.

Ms Dodds said the agency would never release any details about the deceased, her assets or her will publically and had not ruled out pursuing charges against either party after being in contact with NSW police over the matter.

She also said SBS had been asked to remove the segment from its site but so far the network had refused.

‘The NSWTG will be lodging a complaint with the Australian Communications and Media Authority on the basis of a breach of privacy, Ms Dodds said.

The woman lived with her husband, who died in an aged care facility in 2001, in their Auburn house from 1966

Ms Iordanidis, owner of All Gone Extreme Clean, claims she was misled about the focus of the show and that she begged the producer not to run the show.

The footage shows Ms Iordanidis pointing to a chair in the kitchen saying 'obviously she was sitting at this seat and the seat has fallen - we’ve got maggot activity and fly activity.'

Then she holds up the remains of the woman's scalp while stating ‘that’s her scalp that’s come off her head’.

She then went on to describe in graphic detail about what happens to the body after a person dies.

‘Within six minutes the fly lands on the body to lay maggots then you fill up with gases – it actually turns a greeny black and the body  explodes – you’re virtually left with bone,’ she explained to the camera.'

Meanwhile, SBS commented that it was acting in ‘good faith’ that Lee Iordanidis had the right and authority to complete the cleaning job.

The deceased woman was born in the Czech Republic in 1924 and studied medicine before travelling to Egypt where she was married.

She worked as a bilingual translator in Morocco before immigrating to Australia in 1957.

Then she lived with her husband in their Auburn house from 1966. He died in 2001 in an aged care facility.

Trustee chief executive Imelda Dodds said Ms Iordanidis only had permission to access the house to provide a  cleaning quote
