Chelsea Handler is the queen of late night snark and has made a career out of cheerfully taunting celebrities.

But the chat show host, who will bid farewell to her E! show Chelsea Lately in August, admits she is quitting because she is totally fed up of stars.

In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, the statuesque blonde, 39, said: 'To be quite honest I don't really care 
about Justin Bieber and I don't want to talk about him anymore. In order
 to make that happen I had to just stop doing my show. Straight away.

Sick of it! Chelsea Handler says that after seven years of taunting celebrities, she's over it- saying: 'I don't care about Justin Bieber and I don't want to talk about him anymore'. The blonde is seen interviewing the teen idol on 2011

Network buddies: Chelsea Handler is leaving E! home to Keeping Up With The Kardashians. She will film her last show in August

Bieber, 20, has often been on Chelsea 
Lately, flirting with Chelsea and prompting her to tell him once: 'I'm 
always better when you're here.' And talking about the troubled teen 
idol's drink driving arrest in January, she gave him the advice: 'Don't go out. It's 
okay to party and have fun and be crazy, but don't hurt other people. 
You have to do that in the confines of your home. And yeah, I'm all 
about that. I've got a party at my house all the time. ... I'm just a 
danger to myself, not to others.'

Chelsea announced her departure from the E! in May,  instantly being linked with a move to CBS to take over from Craig Ferguson on the Late Late Show.

However, Chelsea denied the rumours, saying: 'I've
 had seven years of being on the show but I was just kinda over it and 
tired and I have a really proper new exciting project which will be 
announced in the next two weeks which I'm super happy about.

'I'm 
excited more than anything about that.

'I'm not doing CBS Late Late. 
Anything being rumoured is not what I'm doing. I'm going to do a show. 
It will be a refresh situation, a little bit more mindful and a little 
bit more interesting for me and my viewers.'

Despite being in a Hollywood clique - and highly protective of friends who include A listers Jennifer Aniston, Cameron Diaz and Reese Witherspoon - Chelsea said she was exhausted of being made to cover the shenanigans that surround the Kardashians.

Even though she is on the same network as Keeping Up With The Kardashians - and Khloe stood in for her while she was away in April - she said: 'I think if you participate in the celebrity world 
then you don't really have a choice but to be involved in the drama.

'You
 end up getting so into the mix that it changes the topics of the day. 
You can sit around and complain about all that s**t and the Kardashians
 all day but if you're participating in it then what can you do? It 
really didn't feel great doing the show and the only way to sort things 
out was to extricate myself from the entire situation.'

Enough is enough: Kris Jenner appears on Chelsea Lately - while Khloe Kardashian even stood in for Chelsea when the host was away in April

Just like college: Chelsea, seen with her sidekick Chuy Bravo, said she was 'glad I went'

Currently on tour with a show based on 
her New York Times bestseller Uganda Be Kidding Me, Chelsea plans to 
take some well deserved R&R when the tour finishes.

She has 
plans to travel around Europe, Asia 'and where ever the wind blows 
me...then it will be time to start up a new kind of show.'

She said: 'Now I want to 
do things differently. I want to talk to people who are going to educate
 me. Politicians, medical professionals and people with real human 
interest stories.

'I want to talk to people who have changed the course 
of the world. Inventors, invaders and people who have been doing 
exciting stuff.'

E! told Variety the last month of Chelsea Lately would feature special guests and special episodes.

And as ever Chelsea had a sense of humour as she announced the end of the show, saying: 'I
 myself am more surprised than anyone that I was able to hold down a job
 for seven years, and it was a fantastic seven years.

'I will always look back at my time on E! as most people look back at their time in college. I’m glad I went.'

The show will be replaced by a new, longer episode of E!'s entertainment news.

New challenge: Chelsea is ending her chatshow after seven years

'We are very proud of ‘Chelsea Lately’s’ long-running success and the unique space that the series carved out in late night television,' E! president Suzanne Kolb in a statement.

'Chelsea brought a distinct voice to latenight with her acerbic wit and fearless commentary, and we look forward to providing fans with a memorable sendoff that lives up to that tradition.

'Most of all, we are grateful to the Chelsea Lately team for making this show so special for seven years.'

Chelsea Handler brings her show Uganda Be Kidding Me to the London Palladium on July 12 - tickets are available at www.livenation.co.uk.
