Cities in Germany have warned that ‘social peace’ there is at risk due to an influx of economic migrants from Bulgaria and Romania.

In a stark warning to the UK, reports tell of an epidemic of illegal working, chaos in schools because so many children can’t speak German, and an alarming increase in organised crime since the migrants arrived.

Dortmund, Hanover, Berlin and Hamburg say they are struggling to absorb a six-fold increase in economic migration from the two countries since 2006.

The rise is exacerbated by the euro 
crisis, which has forced Bulgarians and Romanians to seek a better life 
in their nearest big economy.

A report by the German Association of Cities says they face ‘significant
costs as a result of this poverty migration’.

They are demanding 
financial support from Chancellor Angela Merkel, telling her ‘the social
balance and social peace is extremely endangered’.

It comes as worried councils in the UK appeal for help with an expected 
influx of migrants from Bulgaria and Romania when they are given free 
access to our jobs market from the start of next year.

Westminster City Council is already spending thousands buying return 
tickets for Romanian rough sleepers when they arrive at Victoria Coach 
station.

It has warned that more arrivals will put greater pressure on 
already overstretched schools and housing services.

UK: Bulgarians and Romanians who come to Britain from January 1, 2014, will be eligible for most benefits if they have work, are self-employed or seeking a job, have an address and intend to stay.

They would be means tested, but could get: Jobseeker’s allowance, housing benefit, working tax credits, incapacity benefit, disability living allowance, income support and child benefit.

Germany: Immigrants can claim child benefit until the child is 18, or 25 if still in education.

It is £160 per month for each of the first two children, £165 for the third and £187 for each subsequent one.

A scheme barring EU citizens from jobless benefits until they have worked in Germany for a year is being legally challenged.

Romania and Bulgaria: The only government welfare payments are child benefit, which is £3.50 per youngster per week in Bulgaria and £3.69 in Romania.

Councillor Nickie Aitken said: ‘We need some firm answers from the 
Government both on numbers and whether we can expect any extra help for 
bulging school rolls and housing services already squeezed to the 
maximum.’

Romania and Bulgaria joined the EU in 2007 but under ‘transitional 
controls’, most low-skilled workers have continued to require permission
to come to the UK.

From January 1, almost 30million Romanians and Bulgarians will be 
entitled to live and work freely in  the UK. Ministers won’t put an 
estimate on how many will travel here but the campaign group 
Migrationwatch says it could be as many as 70,000 a year.

Officially, 
there are 42,000 Bulgarians in the UK, but unofficially it could be up 
to 80,000. There are also thought to be 93,000 Romanians already here.

In Germany there are more than 90,000 Bulgarians and 159,000 Romanians. 
They are not allowed to work legally until January 1, as in Britain. But
they can stay under EU rules if they declare themselves to be 
‘self-employed’.

However the report by the German cities says: ‘The Roma
in particular end up in desolate conditions once they are here.’

Police claim Romanian gangs send children out each morning with 
instructions to steal. And in Munster new arrivals from Romania and 
Bulgaria last year formed a tent city alongside a canal.
