For many, just taking part in a single marathon is the achievement of a lifetime, but Julie Weiss, they've become something of a weekly routine.

She has run 52 of them - one a week - for the past year in memory of her dad who passed away from pancreatic cancer.

Yesterday, the 42-year-old California mother of two finally stopped as she crossed the finish line of the Los Angeles Marathon.

Marathon Goddess: Julie Weiss has run 52 marathons in 52 weeks raising money for pancreatic cancer awareness in memory of her father who died from the disease

Her aim was to raise awareness of the disease that killed her father just one month after he was diagnosed in November 2010.

Doctors say the disease has less than a 5 percent survival rate.

'Pancreatic cancer is my only competition out there and I intend to beat it,' she told the Today Show.

'As I learned more about pancreatic cancer, I had to do something more to raise awareness and raise hope and raise money for this severely underfunded disease,' she said, 'so I decided to do something dramatic.'

1362 miles: Yesterday was Julie's final marathon having completed one race each week for an entire year. She has raised almost $180,000

In the name of her father: Maurice Weiss died from pancreatic cancer. His daughter Julie was told he'd live another six months but he passed away after one. She thinks of him every step of the way

Challenge: Julie's modesty shines through. She says the real task isn't the 26.2 miles each weekend but traveling and returning back to California for work on the Monday morning!

Julie began her incredible challenge with a marathon in Rome and then entered a race every weekend in some city across North America.

As soon as she left work at 5pm on Friday she would be on a plane, ready to begin the next race, before heading home to California on the Sunday.

Julie says the real challenge is to travel to a different city, state or country each weekend and be back in the office for Monday morning - all while raising two children.

Charity: Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States and killed Julie's father Maurice just 35 days after he was diagnosed

Triumphant: Julie Weiss, 42, releases air balloons to commemorate with members of the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, after completing her 52nd marathon in 52 weeks

Still going: Julie Weiss with her friend David Levine after completing yesterdays LA marathon. She says she will rest for a while but will complete another year of marathons by 2020 and raise $1 million

She has only been running for the past five years. Initially it was to lose some weight and get in better shape physically and mentally.

What began as simply running around the block moved into running races before she finally progressed onto marathons.

It made her father, Maurice, extremely proud, and after each race she would call her Dad to tell him how she had done.

In that short amount of time she has earned the nickname 'Marathon Goddess' and become something of a folk hero in the running community.

According to her nicknamed website MarathonGoddess.com the 1,362 miles she's covered has raised almost $180,000 for charity.'

Running in memory: Weiss lost her dad to pancreatic cancer in 2010, just a few weeks before she qualified for the Boston Marathon.
Through her website, marathongoddess.com, she's hoping to raise $1,000,000 by 2020

Making each one count: Julie started running and her father thought it was fantastic. He supported her on her journey to qualify for the Boston Marathon. He passed away before the race but she says she felt his presence every step of the way

'When people tell me I'm crazy or nuts, it means I'm on the right track and doing something good,' she says.

Online she pledges the following: 'To honor my father, I will run 52 marathons in one year to show how strong the human spirit can be.

When you do what you love, for those you love, that is where the miracles happen. Together we can make a difference, and pave the way to a happy, healthy, cancer free life.'

Medallion woman: Julie Weiss holds down a full-time job and raised nearly $180,000 so far. She credits the memories of her dad and others who have suffered with pancreatic cancer fueling her 42-year-old legs

Nickname: She's known as the Marathon Goddess in running circles... for obvious reasons!

Although she is spurred on by the memory of her father, on her Facebook page she dedicated each marathon to a cancer victim.

Julie says she's hanging up her running boots for now but is hoping to run another set of 52 marathons in 52 weeks to reach her ultimate goal of $1 million for pancreatic cancer research and awareness.
