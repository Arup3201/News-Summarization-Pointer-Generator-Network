They don't call her Queen B for nothing.

She's just wrapped up one of the biggest performances of her career at the Super Bowl, and now she's ready to take on the world.

Dressed up to promote her Mrs. Carter Show world tour the 31-year-old songstress looks every inch the queen of pop with a billowing Victorian updo topped with a crown and golden royal-looking garb.

And it seems there was no expense spared for the stunning shots, with even her gold-tipped nails costing a staggering £560 - that's £56 for each nail.
