The company that was due to make the scratchproof sapphire glass screen for the Apple Watch it still in crisis and may be forced to shut down, it has been revealed. 

GT Advanced Technologies, a former stock market darling and supplier to Apple,
filed for bankruptcy on Oct 6 in a stunning turn of events for a
company whose fortunes looked bright only a few months ago.

Apple said on Thursday that GT's 'ambitious' vision of sapphire
manufacturing was ultimately not quite ready for primetime. 

Apple's Watch uses a sapphire glass screen - but the firm that makes it may have to shut down

Synthetic sapphire is a hard, transparent material made of crystallising aluminium oxide, produced at high temperatures.

As the material is heated, it forms disks that can be sliced using diamond-coated saws.

These round disks are ground into shape, and polished, to become glass.

The technology is traditionally used in watch displays because it is thin, super-strong and scratch resistant.

Apple already uses sapphire crystal in the Touch ID fingerprint scanner on its latest iPhone 5S and to protects the phone's camera.

As a result, sapphire glass could potentially replace Gorilla Glass currently used in most high-end smartphones. 

Few details have emerged since the bankruptcy filing, which
wiped out most of GT's market value and triggered speculation
over what may have soured its relationship with Apple.

But on Thursday, Apple, which had backed the development
with GT of a sapphire-manufacturing plant in Arizona, said it
will keep an eye on GT's advances, holding open the possibility
of doing business with it in future.

'Apple put a lot of effort into an ambitious new sapphire
manufacturing process with GTAT which is not ready for
production. 

'We're going to continue evaluating GTAT's progress
on larger sapphire boule development, as well as consider other
options for the facility,' spokeswoman Kristin Huguet said,
referring to raw cylinders of the material.

At the heart of GT's bankruptcy filing was a deal struck
with Apple in November 2013. 

GT Advanced was to have used the
Arizona plant to make scratch-resistant sapphire exclusively for
Apple. 

That sapphire was to have eventually found its way into
future mobile devices, such as iPhones - where it's already in
use in their fingerprint sensors - or the upcoming Apple Watch.

On Thursday, GT said it will continue 'technical exchanges'
with Apple on making larger, next-generation sapphire boules, 
raw cylinders of the material that effectively increase capacity
and lower the unit cost of production. 

GT said it would expand
into boules of more than 165 kg, from the current 115 kg.

On Thursday, GT Advanced also laid out the details of an
agreement struck and described in court on Tuesday.

Apple CEO Tim Cook shows off the new iPhone 6 and the Apple Watch during an Apple special event at the Flint Center for the Performing Arts on September 9. both products use sapphire glass - the watch for its screen, and the phone for its touch ID fingerprint sensor

Under that pact, GT will stop making sapphire materials for
now and focus on supplying equipment to make sapphire crystals.

GT said it would be released from all exclusivity
obligations with Apple and a mechanism would be provided for the
iPhone maker to recover its $439 million pre-payment to the
company, without interest.

At a hearing this week at the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Springfield, Massachusetts, GT said the expected deal with Apple
would save money and allow it to be more open about its
mysterious Chapter 11 filing.

GT said on Thursday it would wind down its sapphire
production factories in Mesa, Arizona and Salem, Massachusetts.
It has laid off about 650 employees at the Mesa plant and
expects additional job cuts in Salem.

GT will retain control of its intellectual property and will
be able to sell its sapphire fabrication technology without
restrictions, it said in a statement.
