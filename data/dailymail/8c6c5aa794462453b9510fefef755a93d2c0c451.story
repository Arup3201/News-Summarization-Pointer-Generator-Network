A black man pushed off a Paris Metro train by Chelsea fans chanting racist abuse last month says he can no longer take public transport and is depressed after the attack.

The man, identified as Soulemayne S, says the incident, which happened before Chelsea played a Champions League match agains Paris Saint-Germain, has 'destroyed' him.

He says coverage of the attack, for which five men have been handed court summonses, has 'traumatised' his children, and forced him to explain the concept of racism to them.

Soulemayne S, the black man subjected to racist abuse on the Paris Metro last month, said the incident has left him depressed, unable to work, and has 'traumatised' his children

A video showed the men pushing Soulemayne before chanting 'we're racist and that's the way we like it' (pictured). Police say five men are due to appear in court in connection with the attack

Soulemayne was recorded being pushed off the Metro train by a group of supporters who then began chanting 'we're racist and that's the way we like it.'

He told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'I'm here like a child. I have got a phobia of public transport. I can't take public transport to go to work - since what happened I have been under a lot of pressure. 

'I have been referred to a psychologist. I can't sleep any more. Every hour, every instant, I think about what happened. I think about the ordeal.'

He said his family had been 'divided' by the 'humiliation' he experienced, adding : 'I am obliged to tell [my children] that there are people who aren't very nice, and that there are people who don't like black skin.'

Speaking about Chelsea's offer of a free ticket to last night's second leg match at Stamford Bridge, he said: 'This offer to go, this invitation, is just an attempt to make things up. For the moment I don't want to come because of what they've caused, the team and their fans.

'The Chelsea supporters have destroyed me. Even when I drive my car I feel like I'm being followed. I don't know if I am being followed by Chelsea fans, or police or the media. 

'Even when I go and see my lawyer I am followed, when I go to see my therapist I feel like I'm being followed, and I've never had that in my life.

'The only problem I have in my life right now is because of Chelsea and their fans.'

On his decision to reject the invitation to tonight's game, Soulemayne S previously told RTL radio: 'I don't want to sit in that stadium next to those people who pushed me.

This is the moment Chelsea fans were recorded pushing Soulemayne off the Metro ahead of a clash with Paris St-Germain, an incident which Soulemayne says has 'destroyed' him

Soulemayne refused to attend last night's second leg clash between Chelsea and Paris St-Germain in London, which Jose Mourinho's men lost, knocking them out of the Champions League

'I won't go. They can't buy me with a little piece of paper. I'm not a child.'

A Chelsea spokesman said: 'We appreciate he doesn't want to come to this particular game, however, our offer remains open and we hope he'll take us up on it so he can meet real Chelsea fans and experience the true spirit of the club.'

Five men involved in the incident were today and yesterday served with summonses over the issue, Scotland Yard said. 

The men will appear at Waltham Forest Magistrates' Court on March 25 'regarding a police application for football banning orders'. 

Football banning orders are issued by courts following a conviction for a football-related offence after a complaint by the Crown Prosecution Service or local police, the Home Office website says.

They can last for between three and 10 years. Breaches of the orders can result in a sentence of up to six months in prison.

Chelsea FC said previously it was 'appalled' and apologised to the victim, while manager Jose Mourinho said he was 'ashamed' of the fans involved.

Fans were again accused of racism this month after claims a group were heard using the N-word and anti-Semitic slurs on a train from London to Manchester.

One supporter was allegedly overheard saying 'Paris, Paris, Paris, that's the way we like it, a n***** on the door' after their victory over Tottenham in the Capital One Cup.
