To chants of 'Batkid, Batkid, Batkid!' and the strains of Journey's Don't Stop Believing, five-year-old Batkid Miles Scott stepped down from a stage outside San Francisco's City Hall with the key to the city and memories to last a lifetime.

After a full day of crime fighting, the leukemia-survivor's wish to be Batkid for a day had come true and culminated in a ceremony watched by thousands of people who lined the streets to catch a glimpse of the city's smallest hero.

As many as 12,000 people in San Francisco turned out to help make Miles' wish come true, and millions more watched on from around the world - including President Obama, who tweeted in support of the brave Batkid.

The 
President also employed another form of social media in honor of Miles, 
using Vine to tell him, 'Way to go, Miles! Way to save Gotham!'As Miles worked his way around the city, crowds of San Franciscans lined the streets to watch his heroics. First, he rescued a damsel in distress, then he foiled a dastardly plan to rob the bank by the Riddler, and his third challenge was to rescue mascot Lou Seal from the clutches of the Penguin.Patricia
 Wilson of the Make-A-Wish Foundation paid tribute to the hundred of 
people and thousands of well-wishers who made Miles' wish come true. From
 a special edition of the Gotham City Chronicle to a 
Batmobile, there was nothing Wilson could not procure for the little 
superhero.'It might be the first time a Lamborghini has had a booster seat,' she joked.

Wilson said that every person she called to make Miles' wish happen wanted to help.

'Every time I picked up the phone, I got a yes. And it was followed by a question: How else can I help?' she said.

For Miles' parents, his day as Batkid symbolizes a new beginning for Miles and the Scott family.

'This is closure for us. He finished treatment in June, it's been a long three years for us. So this is one way to kick it off,' said father Nick Scott.

The Make-A-Wish foundation transformed the
 streets of San Francisco into Gotham City so that the 
young cancer victim could achieve his dream of becoming a superhero today.

Miles Scott, from Sikiyou
 County, near Oregon, assumed the persona of 'Batkid', donning a 
mini-cape in his crusade to rid the city of its fiercest foes, the 
Penguin and the Riddler.

Thousands
 of volunteers signed up to help cheer along the boy, who is in 
remission after a four-year battle with leukemia, as he enjoys his dream
 day granted by the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

When the charity, which grants wishes for ill children, asked Miles to name his dream, his answer was simply: 'I want to be Batkid!'

It sparked a massive effort by the foundation, friends, strangers and the city of San Francisco to ensure this heroic little boy could achieve his dream.

Finally, on Friday morning, he was called into service by San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr.

Hundreds of people lined the streets and cheered as he emerged from the Batmobile - driven by an adult Batman - before freeing a damsel who had been tied to cable car tracks.

As she embraced him in thanks, he got a call that the Riddler was trying to rob a vault 
downtown, so headed to the Financial District and promptly stopped the thief in his tracks.

News cameras captured the moment the Riddler was hauled from the bank and taken away by police officers.

After battling his enemy, he headed to Burger Bar to refuel, his Make-A-Wish itinerary explained.

While at Burger Bar, he received get a 
call on his batphone to go to the window where he saw a 
huge group of volunteers screaming for Batman’s help - because the Penguin was kidnapping a famous Gotham City mascot - Lou Seal.

Batman and Batkid raced to AT&T 
park to apprehend the villain and freed Lou Seal, the San Francisco 
Giants mascot since 1996.

After catching the Penguin, Batkid made his final stop at City Hall, where the Mayor and the Police 
Chief of Gotham City thanked him and gave him the key to the city.

Batkid was praised for his efforts, with Senator Dianne Feinstein tweeting: 'Thanks for saving Gotham, Batkid!'

Ahead of his heroic efforts, little Miles underwent acrobatic training with his 'Batman', inventor and acrobat 
Eric Johnston, to prepare him for his big day.

Johnston and his wife, Sue Graham 
Johnston, who played the damsel, even created Bat-style 
gadgets such as a wrist device that played previously recorded 
messages from San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr for Batkid throughout
 the day.

Johnston said of Batkid: 'He's
 an excellent superhero because he's a totally mild-mannered kid when 
the mask is off. But when he puts on the armored Batsuit, he's 
uncontainable. He shines.'

Around 1,000 special edition 'Gotham 
City Chronicle' newspapers will be handed out at Union Square today, 
with the headline: 'Batkid saves city.'

And
 even the illustrators for the original Batman are involved, after 
Andrew Farago, curator of the Cartoon Art Museum in San Francisco, 
reached out to cartoonists and DC Comics.

Graham Nolan,
 who drew the Batman series through the 1990s and co-created of the 
villain, Bane, was the first to respond - and sent through a drawing 
showing Miles as Batkid fighting Bane.

Nolan signed it: 'For Miles, a real superhero!'

'We
 certainly all were children who had dreams of being a superhero and 
being larger than life,' Farago told the Mercury News.

'But I think this
 has touched people because most of us have never had to overcome the 
obstacles that this boy has.'

While the day of saving damsels in distress and capturing the Riddler 
will no doubt be great fun for Miles, it is also an important day for 
his family.

'This wish has meant closure for our 
family and an end to over three years of putting toxic drugs in our 
son's body,' said his mother Natalie, the San Jose Mercury News reported.

The Make-A-Wish Foundation grants the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions to give them hope.

Other
 incredible wishes it has granted include Justin Bieber meeting 
eight-year-old Annalysha Brown-Rafanan, who suffers from a 
life-threatening liver condition, and 11-year-old Tyler Sue, who has a serious genetic condition, meeting her 'Cake Boss' idol, Buddy Valastro.
