Plight: Danny Binks in hospital in Bodrum, Turkey, after he was stabbed with a broken bottle in a brawl with a gang who accused him of stealing a watch

A British tourist has been left badly hurt and stranded in Turkey after he was attacked by locals and stabbed with a broken bottle.

Danny Binks, 20, was set upon by a gang of up to 15 men in front of his fiancée after he was accused of stealing a watch from a jewellery shop in Bodrum, a popular tourist town.

After he fled down an alley, witnesses say he was attacked by a man who stabbed him four times in the chest.

Mr Binks, a joiner from Poulton, Lancashire, 
was taken to a local hospital where he underwent emergency surgery for 
stab wounds to his chest, a severed liver and cuts to vital arteries.

His condition was so serious he was initially treated in intensive care, but he is now recovering on a mainstream ward.

Although
 Mr Binks’ fiancée, Remi Simpson, 21, had taken out on holiday insurance
 they are worried they might still have to pay for his medical treatment
 and flights home.

Insurers are waiting for a police and hospital report of the incident before deciding whether to pay out.

One
 man is thought to have been arrested and Turkish police are due to take
 a statement from Mr Binks about the attack last Friday. Until officers 
speak to the holidaymaker, he is not allowed to leave the country.

The
 family is now facing the prospect of a medical bill, interpreter costs,
 accommodation and new flights. They fear it could spiral to more than 
£20,000. So far wellwishers have raised £2,165 towards a £5,000 goal of 
getting the holidaymaker home.

In a statement, Mr Binks said he believed the man who stabbed him was the owner of the shop who had accused him of stealing the watch.

'It all happened so fast. We had been for a meal and went into a shop to buy some things,' he said.

'We went to another shop and this guy chased us saying I had pinched a watch from his shop, which of course I hadn’t, and said I needed to go back to the shop to be searched.

'It was really intimidating. All of a sudden there was 15 of them there - I had no chance. Before I knew it they were battering me. I had wounds all over me.

'We managed to get away but then the shopkeeper appeared and stabbed me.

'I don’t remember much after that apart from sitting on a chair pressing my T-shirt into my side where all the blood was.'

He added: 'Depending on what the police say I may have to go to court to give evidence due to the seriousness of the offence. Until then I can’t go home. I’m in a lot of pain. All I want to do now is go home. It’s a nightmare.'

Mr Binks with his fiancée Remi Simpson: He wrote on Facebook that the stress of the experience and his brush with death had finally given him the courage to propose to Miss Simpson, who witnessed the attack

Miss Simpson, a project manager at a 
construction firm, said: 'When Danny went back to the shop the 
shopkeeper tried to lock him inside.

'There were 15 or 20 of them there with metal poles and other weapons. He didn’t stand a chance.

'It
 was awful, I just couldn’t do anything. There were lots of people 
trying to help and get them off Danny. I felt sick at seeing Danny being
 attacked like that.

'I have
 spoken to my bank NatWest who I am insured with and they can’t say 
whether they will pay out or not until they have got the hospital report
 and police report.

'They 
have got the medical report now but obviously not the police report 
until Danny has been interviewed. My mum has to fly home on Wednesday 
and I’ll be staying here.

'It’s so scary, it’s horrible. We just don’t know how long we will be here.'

Mr Binks had been on holiday with Miss Simpson, her mother Nicola, 42, and her mother's partner Daniel.

Mr Binks's friend Dave Palmer, 23, has flown out to Turkey to be at his bedside. He said: 'We have set up an account to which people can make donations to help pay for the medical costs and the response has been great so ar.

'It was already up at £715 in just a few hours. Danny is going to be off work for a while whatever happens so we are grateful for all the help anybody can give us.

'It costs me and Remi £90 a day to get to the hospital and back. for Remi to sleep in the hospital with Dan it’s £120 per night, they’re both in pieces about the whole situation and they need to be there for each other.

'They need food [and] drinks and probably have to pay for the flight home.

'Dan had to go to court over here and he can’t come home until it’s all sorted. The police are taking a statement so it could be a while before he gets back.”

A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: 'We are aware of the hospitalisation of a British national in Bodrum, Turkey on July 4. We are providing consular assistance.'
