Besiktas boss Slaven Bilic will be banned from the touchline when the Turks face Arsenal in London in the second leg of their Champions League play-off next week.

Bilic was dismissed from the touchline in the final seconds of the first leg, a stormy goalless draw in Istanbul's Ataturk Olympic Stadium.

He hoped it would not incur a ban, since it was at the very end of the match, he apologised immediately and his disciplinary record has been good, but UEFA have confirmed that the automatic one-ban suspension will stand.

Their Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body will decide on the full extent of the final sanction when they meet next week.

It comes as a considerable blow for Besiktas as Bilic is such an influential figure during games, constantly on the touchline, directing his players and motivating.

The former West Ham and Everton defender became agitated during the second half as tackles started to fly in from both teams and Aaron Ramsey was sent off for two yellow cards.

He was warned by the Serbian referee Milorad Mazic but continued to berate the fourth official and exploded furiously when the game was halted with Besiktas on the attack so that Mathieu Flamini could receive treatment after being hit by the ball.

After the game, Bilic said: 'I have apologised. It was a big game for us, right. I just wasn't happy with some of the decisions. After the game I apologised to the referee and to Mr Wenger. No hard feelings or whatever. I made a mistake.

'Maybe I over-reacted in that situation when he stopped the game when the ball hit Flamini in the stomach and we were in a good position, two against one... But nothing serious happened in that moment or after the game.'

He added that he hoped to avoid a ban. 'I'm not used to this kind of situation,' said Bilic. 'I had 60 or 70 games with Croatia, but this is only the second time I've been asked to leave the dug-out. I don't know the rules... but I see no reason for me not to be in the dug-out in London, really. If that was a reason, many coaches would be missing from the dug-out.'

The UEFA ban will stand firm. He will be allowed into the Emirates Stadium to watch the second-leg but he will be denied access to his squad, which will keep him out of the dressing room before the game and at half-time.

Ramsey will also serve an automatic one-match ban for his red card. UEFA are still considering the incident reported by Wenger, that a bottle was thrown in his direction from the crowd after the game.
