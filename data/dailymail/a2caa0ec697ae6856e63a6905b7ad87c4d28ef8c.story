Rickie Lambert has been getting over the disappointment of England's World Cup exit by jetting straight off to Barbados with his family.

The 32-year-old made just one brief appearance in Brazil, coming on in the closing stages with the team trailing 2-1 to Uruguay, but seems to have bounced back fairly quickly.

He is currently in the Caribbean with his wife, Amy, and his three sons.

But for all the disappointment he must be feeling, there will also be a huge swell of optimism as he prepares to begin training with new club Liverpool - a move that was completed before the World Cup started.

He is moving to the club he has supported all his life from Southampton after five years, 235 appearances and 117 goals.

And with Luis Suarez's future still unclear following his ban, he could be seeing plenty of action over the coming months.
