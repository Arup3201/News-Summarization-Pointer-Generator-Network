Ed Miliband's political turmoil intensified yesterday after Labour admitted it had been forced to stop using David Cameron as a ‘scare tactic’ in Scotland – because the Prime Minister is more popular with voters than Mr Miliband.

Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy admitted that the party had ditched its mantra of ‘Vote SNP – get Cameron’ in favour of ‘Vote SNP – get Tory’, after strategists vetoed plans to portray the Election as a straight fight between Mr Miliband and Mr Cameron.

Mr Murphy said: ‘It’s the same argument, but the “Vote Tory” thing has a much greater resonance. Among working-class Scots, voting Tory is associated with Mrs Thatcher, more so than David Cameron.’

The U-turn comes barely a week after Mr Miliband insisted during a visit to Glasgow that the point of the Election was ‘Who is going to be Prime Minister, is it going to be Cameron or Miliband?’

A devastating set of polls by Tory peer Lord Ashcroft in Labour’s Scottish heartlands last week revealed Mr Cameron was considerably more popular than Mr Miliband in Scotland. 

In 15 out of the 16 constituencies studied, including several of Labour’s supposedly ‘safe’ seats, more voters said they were either satisfied with David Cameron or preferred him to Ed Miliband than said they would prefer the Labour leader to be Prime Minister.

If the findings were repeated at the Election, Mr Miliband’s party could be wiped off Scotland’s political map, losing 35 of its 41 seats to the SNP and allowing Nicola Sturgeon’s Nationalists to play a key power-broking role in a new Left-wing Coalition.

A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said: ‘Most Scots prefer David Cameron to Ed Miliband as Prime Minister and it now appears that Jim Murphy agrees with them. 

'His Election strategy has been laid bare – avoid all mention of his leader, drag up 40-year-old memories of Mrs Thatcher, and hope no one notices. It’s negative and weak.’

The embarrassment for Mr Miliband emerged as his health spokesman Andy Burnham appeared to be positioning with increasing confidence as the Left-wing candidate in any post-Election leadership contest.

Mr Burnham lavished praise on Unite leader Len McCluskey, whose union votes will be crucial, and criticised Blairites.

In particular, he distanced himself from Peter Mandelson’s infamous comment that he was ‘intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich’. 

Mr Burnham told The Times: ‘I don’t think any person in the Labour Party feels relaxed about the gaps in society.’

His remarks came as former Business Secretary Mr Mandelson went on to the BBC Radio 4 Today programme to deny that he had ‘sounded out’ former Home Secretary Alan Johnson last autumn about trying to topple Mr Miliband.

Meanwhile, Lord Ashcroft yesterday released revised poll data that shows Nick Clegg is facing the loss of his Sheffield Hallam seat.

It is the second poll in a week to indicate the Liberal Democrat leader will lose his seat to Labour.

The initial poll last November put the Lib Dems narrowly ahead, but the revised results show them three points behind Labour. 

A second corrected poll saw figures for the seat of Thanet South, where Ukip leader Nigel Farage is standing, revised. 

The Tories’ five-point lead over Mr Farage has been reduced to one.
