A man who bought a talking toy remote control for his toddler grandson was outraged when it blurted out 'f***s' instead of the number six.

Joe McManus, 61, paid Â£4.50 for the Little Tikes First Remote Control at an Asda branch in Birkby, West Yorkshire, for 18-month-old Vinnie Lydall who he said was 'mad about gadgets'.

He returned it to store staff - who said they agreed it sounded rude and said they would clear all other models from the shelves.

Foul-mouthed: Joe McManus, 61, was shocked when he realised the toy he bought at Asda for his 18-month-old grandson Vinnie Lydall was blurting out 'f***s' in a robotic voice instead of the number six

Hanging on the telephone: Mr McManus claimed his complaints to the firm were not taken seriously enough

But although the supermarket said Mr McManus was the only customer to complain, he fears the foul-mouthed toy could be a bad influence on other children.

The grandfather-of-10 said: 'Vinnie was just sat playing with it one day pressing the buttons when we heard it. When you press the six button it says the F-word.

Little Tikes: The firm said 20,000 of the toys have been sold and this was the first complaint

'Call me old-fashioned but I believe that a child's first words should be mum or dad, or maybe please and thank you, but not four-letter swear words.'

He added: 'Vinnie's mad about gadgets and will press the buttons of anything he can get his hands on. He likes to mess around with our iPad and have the Wii on, even if he's not playing on it.

'A few times he's picked up the phone and ended up calling somebody, so we thought we'd buy him his own phone and that would keep him happy.'

The retired plant worker, from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, bought the plastic pink toy which he described as a phone on January 23. When he noticed the defect he returned it to Asda and complained to toy firm Little Tikes.

He said: 'They agreed with me it sounded rude and gave me my money back and assured me they would make sure no more were on the shelf.

'But when I went back a couple of weeks later they had restocked the shelves with more of the phones.

'I took one to the customer service lady who said they didn't have the authority to take items off the shelves.

'She said she'd look into it but didn't really seem interested. I don't have a problem with Asda, but I think there's been a lack of communication in customer services.

'This has been going on for weeks now... I'm surprised no-one else has complained.

Bad education: Mr McManus hoped the toy would teach Vinnie to count, but it taught him otherwise

Profane: Vinnie's grandmother said it was a good thing their other nine grandchildren and not picked it up

'[Little Tikes] said it wasn't their problem and advised that I got in touch with the distributors, so I sent them an email and recieved no reply.'

His wife Jackie, 60, added: 'Luckily, Vinnie is too young to pick up the language, but I would be really annoyed if one of my older grandchildren started playing with it.'

Vinnie is the couple's youngest grandson, and they look after him during the day while his mother Tina, 35, works as a secondary school teacher.

A joint statement by Asda and Little Tikes said: 'We sold 20,000 of these products last year and this is the first complaint we've had of this nature.'
