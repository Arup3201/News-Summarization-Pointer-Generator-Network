Arsenal cruised to a 3-0 victory over Premier League champions Manchester City to lift their first silverware of the season - the Community Shield.

It was largely one-way traffic at Wembley where Arsene Wenger's side made it two trophies from two games but Manuel Pellegrini's men never really turned up.

Sportsmail's Sami Mokbel gives his opinion on the performances of both sets of players.

Champions: Arsenal make it two trophies from two Wembley visits after winning the FA Cup back in May

Rivals: Aaron Ramsey scored an excellent goal against former team-mate Gael Clichy's Manchester City

Opener: Santi Cazorla's neat turn wrong-footed Clichy before he fired past Willy Caballero

Arsenal: 4-2-3-1

Wojciech Szczesny - Has serious competition after the arrival of David Ospina, but was safe as houses. 6.5

Mathieu Debuchy - Bacary Sagna's replacement will be satisfied with his display, but needs to show more defensive responsibility. 6.5

Calum Chambers - Looks sure to be an England regular of the future. Not the quickest, but reads the game well. 7.5

Laurent Koscielny - Largely untroubled but the Frenchman was solid in heart of Arsenal's back-four. 6.5 

Third: Substitute Olivier Giroud scores an excellent long-range goal to give Arsene Wenger food for thought

Kieran Gibbs - Looks in excellent shape. Finally free of injury, he can make a run for the England squad. 7

Mikel Arteta - Skippered the side and led by example. Kept things ticking over in midfield. 7

Aaron Ramsey - Picked up where he left off last season, with another excellent Wembley goal. 8

Jack Wilshere - After an injury free pre-season, the midfielder looked sharp before he was forced off with knock on his knee. 7 

New boys: Alexis Sanchez makes a pass while former Porto man Fernando watches on 

Alexis Sanchez - Dangerous whenever the ball was at his feet. Big hand in Arsenal's second. 6.5

Santi Cazorla - Been talk of him leaving this summer, but remains vital to Arsene Wenger's plans. Excellent goal, too. 7

Yaya Sanogo - Looks far from being an Arsenal player at times, but had a hand in both goals. Work that one out. 6.5 

Subs: Rosicky (for Cazorla, 70) 6, Giroud (for Sanogo 46) 7, Oxlade-Chamberlain 6.5 (for Sanchez 46), Monreal 6.5 (Koscielny 46), Flamini (for Wilshere 68) 6, Campbell (for Ramsey) 5.5

Not used: Martinez. 

Arsene Wenger - Winning is a habit. They've won at Wembley again. The Frenchman will be full of optimism going into the new season. 7.5 

Tussle: Yaya Toure and Jack Wilshere compete for the ball during the Community Shield final

Man City: 4-4-2

Willy Caballero - An opportunity to put pressure on Joe Hart ahead of the new season. He didn't take it. 5

Gael Clichy - Played out on the right-hand side and was kept busy by Cazorla's movement. 6

Dedryck Boyata - Unlikely to feature regularly for the City this season and he looked uncomfortable for City. 5 

Matija Nastasic - Looks set to leave the Etihad Stadium this summer. It looked that way. 5 

Tactics: Manuel Pellegrini gives instructions to James Milner before the Englishman headed on as a substitute

Impressive: Former Southampton defender Calum Chamber looked assured for Arsenal playing in a central role

Aleksander Kolarov - Kept plugging away against the pace of Sanchez, but couldn't stop the Arsenal tide. 5.5

Jesus Navas - A few elaborate touches that came off, but not the Spaniard's best afternoon. 5

Yaya Toure - Strong physical presence in midfield, but struggled to contain the movement of Arsenal's midfield trio during the first half. 6

Fernando - The game bypassed Manchester City's summer signing somewhat. He'll hope for easier afternoons. 6 

Marked: Jesus Navas battles with Kieran Gibbs as the two lined up against each other 

Unpopular: Samir Nasri's every touch was greeted by boos in the first half, he was eventually substituted

Samir Nasri - An unhappy afternoon playing against his former club. Subbed at half-time - much to Arsenal supporters delight. 5

Edin Dzeko - Starved of service from City's midfield before being replaced at half time. 5

Stevan Jovetic - Has looked sharp during pre-season but it was a day to forget. 5.5 

Subs: Richards (for Kolarov 76) 5.5, Milner (for Dzeko) 6, Sinclair (for Navas 86) 5, Silva (for Nasri 46) 6, Zuculini 5.5 (for Toure 46)

Not used: Hart, Rekik 

Manuel Pellegrini - He'll argue that this was just a glorified friendly, but his side looked way off the pace ahead of the big kick-off next week. 

MOM: Aaron Ramsey

Referee: Michael Oliver (Northumberland) - 6.5

Reserves: Neither Yaya Sanogo or Matija Nastasic are likely to be first choice for their clubs this season

Chance: With Sergio Aguero not fit, Stevan Jovetic has a chance to earn a starting spot at Manchester City

Dejected: David Silva and Stevan Jovetic kick off after conceding a third goal
