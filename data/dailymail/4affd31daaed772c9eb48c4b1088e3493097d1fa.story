It's all going swimmingly at the top. Chelsea - leading the way in the Premier League and their Champions League group - looked as if they hadn't a care in the world on Monday morning. 

The Blues face Roberto Di Matteo's Schalke on Tuesday knowing victory will take them through to the knockout stages in Europe. 

And, such is the morale within Jose Mourinho's squad following a glut of wins, they appeared in relaxed mood.

And why not? Chelsea look primed to claw back the league title and are unbeaten heading into December. 

They appear too good to be beaten, while also having both Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas fit and firing ahead of the trip to Germany.  

Mourinho reignited his war of words with the Spanish national team over the weekend, intimating that there were double standards at work in the ongoing club versus country dispute.

'My doctor and the doctor of the Spanish national team, they had the scans and they decided that the player was not in the condition to play,' he said, before rounding on Sergio Ramos for questioning certain players' commitment to Spain. 

'My doctor and the Spanish national team doctor, they had the scans and decided the player was not in a fit condition to play. I don't think Sergio did a medicine masters in the last couple of years to understand it.'

But that won't bother him a jot this week; both of his star performers were on the plane to Gelsenkirchen with the team flying out on Monday afternoon.
