Jeffrey Maxwell, 59, faces charges of kidnapping and aggravated sexual assault

A Texas woman who prosecutors say was tortured for 12 days seemed to be in shock as she spoke to authorities following her rescue, initially defending the man accused of hanging her from a deer-skinning device and chaining her to a bed, according to a recording of the interview played at his trial on Tuesday.

The woman is heard telling an investigator that Jeffrey Allan Maxwell, her former neighbour, told her he'd been hired to kill her.

During the rambling interview after she was found last March, she also said some of her relatives wanted to harm her over a property dispute and urged the investigator to arrest them.

She said she didn't want to get Maxwell in trouble because 'he's been good to me,' but later said he was 'mean.'

Maxwell, 59, is accused of abducting the woman from her rural home, driving her some 100 miles away to his house in Corsicana, about 50 miles south of Dallas, and holding her captive for nearly two weeks. Maxwell is charged with aggravated kidnapping and two counts of aggravated sexual assault. If convicted, he would face up to life in prison.

Testimony is expected to resume on Wednesday.

In the audio recording, an investigator repeatedly yet gently questions the 62-year-old woman before she said Maxwell hit her with a rolling pin and tied her up March 1 inside her Parker County home. She said she briefly escaped and ran down the road before he caught her, pulled out his gun and forced her into the back seat of his vehicle.

She said Maxwell was mad when they 
arrived at his home, and he hit her with a whip and put her wrists in 
some type of device that hoisted her off the ground. Authorities have 
said it was Maxwell's homemade device for skinning deer, and photographs
shown to the jury depict a long, thin wooden board with hooks attached.
A cable was attached to the garage ceiling.

Maxwell, seen here last year, allegedly tortured the woman, who used to live near him and on whom he had reportedly had a crush

'I don't know what it is but he pulled me up in the air,' the woman is heard saying on the audiotape. 'It scared me to death.'

She also said Maxwell told her his 
fingerprints were all over her house so he would have to torch it — 
which authorities say he did two days later.

Sgt Ricky Montgomery, a Parker County
sheriff's investigator, told jurors that authorities conducted a 
massive ground search after fire officials didn't find the woman's body 
in the rubble of her burned home near Weatherford, which is about 60 
miles west of Dallas.

He said authorities had few leads 
until a neighbour reported seeing an unfamiliar blue car drive by twice 
on the day of the fire, and bank records showed no activity on the 
woman's account — except for a $500 check recently cashed by Maxwell. 
Investigators later found out that Maxwell had a blue car and once lived
in that area.

When authorities went to Corsicana on
March 12, Maxwell answered the door and said he was alone — but then 
the woman ran out and said, 'I'm here! I'm here!' Montgomery testified. 
She had a broken arm, head injury and multiple bruises, an emergency 
room doctor testified.

Earlier Tuesday during opening 
statements, prosecutor Kathleen Catania said the woman had been friendly
with Maxwell several years ago but told him to stay off her property 
when he said he wanted to be romantically involved with her.

Defence attorneys declined to make an
opening statement on Tuesday, though they questioned Montgomery about 
whether authorities took photographs and collected evidence at Maxwell's
house before proper search warrants were obtained.

Authorities had a search warrant only
for Maxwell's blue car when they first arrived at his house, but 
Montgomery said law enforcement officers went inside after the woman ran
out to make sure nobody else was being harmed or was a threat. Evidence
was seized after another search warrant was obtained for the house the 
next day, Montgomery testified.

Maxwell will not use an insanity 
defence and is competent to stand trial, his defense attorneys said at a
court hearing last month.

State District Judge Trey Loftin also 
previously denied a defence motion to suppress Maxwell's statements to 
law enforcement authorities.

Defense
attorneys have said Maxwell had asked for a lawyer while being 
questioned shortly after his arrest. But Loftin said Maxwell gave his 
statements voluntarily and requested an attorney only when authorities 
asked if anyone else had helped him.

According to documents, Maxwell told 
an investigator that after he took the woman back to his house, he 
'strung her up' in his garage on a homemade rack used for skinning deer.

Maxwell has also been investigated on suspicion of involvement in the disappearance of his ex-wife Martha Martinez Maxwell.

She has been missing since 1992. Maxwell divorced her in 1995, citing her disappearance.

Martha Martinez Maxwell first went missing in 1987 before being found beaten with her throat cut near Ardmore, Oklahoma. She survived those injuries.

Maxwell was charged with aggravated kidnapping in that case in 1987, but court records show a Tarrant County grand jury declined to indict him, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported.
