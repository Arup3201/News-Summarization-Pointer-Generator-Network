Divock Origi ended a six-month scoring drought with a hat trick as Lille defeated Rennes 3-0 in the French league on Sunday.

Origi, on loan from Liverpool, helped to secure a third consecutive win for Lille, which climbed to eighth in the standings, three points clear of the Brittany side.

Despite a bright opening spell, Rennes failed to convert its early chances and was then overrun by the hosts.

Origi put Lille in front in the 38th minute from close range after making the most of a poor clearance from defender Fallou Diagne.

He doubled his tally from the spot in the 63rd then latched on to Nolan Roux's cross at the back post 10 minutes later to complete his hat trick.

Rennes should have equalized in the 49th when Ola Toivonen netted a clever lob that was incorrectly disallowed for offside.
