Tragedy: Michael Goodman (pictured) was allegedly pushed by his twin brother, fell against a doorknob and hit his head, dying instantly

A grieving mother has vowed to stand by her teenage son after he was charged with killing his identical twin brother in a tragic mistake.

Lynette Goodman, 39, says her family life has been torn apart by what she claims was a 'terrible accident'.

Shockingly, Lynette only moved to Spain six years ago to escape the drug riddled streets of Northampton and provide a safer environment for her sons.

The mother-of four had been living the Spanish dream until she discovered her son Ryan, 19, had killed his twin brother Michael following a 'stupid argument'.

The brothers rowed after their mother shouted at them over money that had gone missing from her purse.

The twins, who lived with Lynette and younger twin brother and sister Owen and Shannon, both 10, blamed each other for stealing the money.

The fight in February last year ended in tragedy when Ryan pushed Michael and he fell against a doorknob and hit his head, dying instantly.

Seeing his brother had no pulse, Ryan dragged Michael’s body out of the family’s country villa, near Valencia, and hid it beneath undergrowth in a ditch just ten metres from their front door.

Michael’s decomposed body was only found in April this year when a wild asparagus picker stumbled across the remains.

A court in the nearby town of Xativa heard last week that DNA testing confirmed Michael’s identity.

The trial is being held in Xativa, close to Valencia, in an area popular with British ex-pats

Lynette, who moved to Spain to live with her father, David, 62, from Blackthorn, Northampton, said she will now support Ryan 'every step of the way' as he faces the harsh Spanish legal system.

She said: 'I love him and I will support him every step of the way. I have to, he’s my son.

'The whole thing has been a nightmare. It was going so well out here, the boys were doing well at school, they had the life of Riley, but now it has all gone so wrong, all because of a terrible, terrible accident.

'This was meant to be a fresh start for all of us. I’d had enough of Blackthorn. It was ‘Smackthorn’, there were drugs everywhere and I needed to get away, I didn’t want my kids to grow up around that.

'I lived two doors away from a drug 
dealer. The children would be playing with syringes, injecting by 
accident and having to go for AIDS tests.

'When my mum died, my dad moved to 
Spain and we went with him to get away. It was going to be our new life 
together in the sunshine.

'It wasn’t meant to turn out like this.

'It took them seven weeks after the body was found to confirm it was Michael.

The twins attended school in the town of Vallada close to where the killing took place

'Everything is so long-winded out here, it takes forever. We’re looking at another six or nine months before we get to the end of all this.

'It was a stupid argument. They were brothers, they argued. There’s nothing more to it than that. I can’t believe it has ended like this.'

Appearing at court in the nearby town of Xativa last week, Ryan told the investigating judge that his brother’s death had been an accident and he was very sorry.

He said: 'I loved my brother and had no intention of killing him' and added that he had hidden the body because he was 'very scared' of the consequences.

The judge remanded him to the custody of youth criminal services because he had been 17-years-old when the crime was committed.

He will spend six months in a juvenile detention centre while he awaits trial.The court heard Lynette had only reported her son missing three months after he vanished.

It is believed Ryan had told the family his brother had returned to England and they did not raise the alarm as he was 'prone to disappear' for weeks at a time.

When there was no sign of the missing teenager his mother made an appeal for help to find him on Facebook.

Police questioned Ryan and his grandfather David, 62, several times about Michael’s disappearance, believing David was covering for his grandson, local reports said.
