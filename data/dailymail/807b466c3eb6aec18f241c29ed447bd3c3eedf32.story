Colin Gregg, 71, back at his Gosforth home after his arrest on suspicion of child sex abuse

The former co-owner of national bakery chain Greggs has been arrested on suspicion of child sex abuse.

Colin Gregg, 71, son of Greggs' founder Jack, was questioned by police on Saturday over alleged sexual abuse of a child in the 1960s.

Police raided his luxury farmhouse in Gosforth, Newcastle upon Tyne, and seized two mobile phones and a laptop.

Mr Gregg and his brother Ian transformed the family bakery business from a single shop in Newcastle into a chain of more than 1,000 stores.

He spent more than 30 years as non-executive director before retiring, while his brother worked as chairman.

A spokeswoman for Northumbria Police 
said: 'A 71-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of sexual 
assault and has been released on police bail.'

Married father-of-three Mr Gregg, who reportedly has shares worth at least Â£5.5million in the company, also ran its charity, the North East Children's Cancer Run in the 1980s.

He worked as a social worker and teacher and later was employed as headteacher at King's School in Tynemouth, Newcastle.

One of Mr Gregg's neighbours told The Sun: 'Everyone here is nice. He and his wife are churchgoers.'

Mr Gregg co-owned the business along with brothers Ian and Colin, sister Gay and mother Elise, when his father died in 1964.

A spokesman for the company told The Sun that he was no longer on the board.

He added: 'It would therefore be wholly inappropriate for us to comment on this matter.'
