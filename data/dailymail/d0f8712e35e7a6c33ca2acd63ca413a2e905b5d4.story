Having provided little to cheer on the pitch, Borussia Dortmund's stars attempted to bring their fans a little happiness another way this week - by serving them beer.

Jurgen Klopp's side sit bottom of the Bundesliga with just 11 points from 13 games, having finished second behind Bayern Munich last season.

Even qualification from their Champions League group, where they lead Arsenal by two points going into the final round of matches, hasn't been enough to lift the gloom around the Westfalenstadion.

However, the fans have stayed loyal to Klopp and his team, and to thank them, Dortmund's stars went behind the bar to pull some pints at Tuesday's Christmas party.

The likes of Marco Reus, Mats Hummels, Ilkay Gundogan and Neven Subotic all gave bar-tending a go, before the squad sat down for a bumper autograph-signing session.

Over 1,000 fans were invited to the party, which has become a traditional part of the season for the German club.
