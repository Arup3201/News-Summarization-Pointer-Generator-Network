An asset management boss is selling his multi-million-dollar Adelaide mansion and moving to Bali to do humanitarian work with his partner.

Erik Metanomski, 52, has put his  five-bedroom mansion on the market, which is located at Austral Terrace in Malvern in the exclusive inner suburbs of Adelaide and expected to sell for around $3.7 million.

Mr Metanomski and his partner Lisa Kenny, 48, have relocated from Australia to Sanur on the Indonesian island where they do work for the John Fawcett Foundation blindness prevention charity and Jodie O'Shea Orphanage respectively.

The five-bedroom mansion is expected to sell in a short amount of time for around $3.7 million

Mr Metanomski, who is chairman of the John Fawcett Foundation, said had been splitting his time between Adelaide and Bali but decided to sell his home and relocate more permanently to Indonesia.

'I never expected I'd end up spending this much time in Bali,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'I'm going to be in Bali two-thirds of the time so having a big house is a bit self-indulgent, so we just decided having a smaller place we could just lock up and leave made more sense.

'My daughter and nephew were living in the house, they were having a great time, so they're probably not so pleased with the decision,' he joked.

The couple, who met in Bali, are both living in Indonesie where they are doing humanitarian work

Ms Kenny quite her high-flying job at Zurich bank in Sydney to volunteer at the Jodie O'Shea Orphanage

Ms Kenny had only planned to stay for six months but she quit her job when she realised she couldn't return to corporate lie

Ms Kenny, who is already living in Bali full-time, said she and Mr Metanomski met there after she moved to the island in November 2013.

Ms Kenny took a six month leave of absence from her job as head of operations for the general insurance division of Zurich bank in order to spend time volunteering at the Jodie O'Shea Orphanage.

'My plan was always to retire and go and volunteer in orphanages around Cambodia and Indonesia,' she said.

'But I just thought about it and thought I could be dead by the time it happens, I just couldn't imagine waiting another 20 years.'

Mr Metanomski is chairman of the John Fawcett Foundation which works to prevent and cure blindness

In Bali there is a high proportion of vision impaired people and the vast majority have curable conditions

When her six month leave in Bali was over Ms Kenny decided she wanted to stay permanently and gave her notice to Zurich.

'Once you've made a lifestyle change it's really difficult to go back and live that corporate lifestyle,' she said.

She now splits her time between the orphanage and running a commercial laundry business on the small island of Flores.

Mr Metanomski said he became involved in the John Fawcett Foundation, which works to prevent and cure blindness in Bali's population, by chance.

Mr Metanomski's mansion has been on the market for five days and he said he expected it to sell quickly

The property is being advertised as 'One of South Australia's finest family estates which is sure to impress the premium buyer who appreciates sophisticated entertaining and the very best in lifestyle living'

'I made a trip to Bali and someone suggested I go see John Fawcett and I was captivated by it all, and so impressed by John and the people working with him,' he said.

'They asked to me take on the role of chairman.'

The foundation carries out eye operations in Bali's villages, where there is a high proportion of vision impaired people and the vast majority have conditions that can be cured.

Mr Metanomski is also a director of investment company Lanyon Asset Management in Adelaide, but he does a lot of his work for the company from his office in Indonesia.
