The Metropolitan Police is being sued for £50,000 over claims a group of six officers allegedly called a suspect a 'black b*****d'.

Jonathan Billinghurst is taking action after officers ambushed him, smashing the windows of the Mini Cooper he was driving with baseball bats.

He claims during the 'unconventional' arrest one officer turned up the music while his colleagues physically and verbally assaulted him, in a manner designed to 'punish, demoralise and humiliate' him.

Jonathan Billinghurst has claimed that he was called a 'black b*****d' as he was arrested in North London

An Independent Police Complaints Commission investigation found the police officers had used excessive force.

But the Met Police claimed in its defence to Mr Billinghurst's claim that 'officers were permitted to use such force'.

The High Court papers, which were filed in October, have emerged after the six officers failed to sue Channel 4 News for libel after the programme broadcast footage of the arrest.

Specifically, the six claimed journalist Simon Israel had insinuated they misled the IPCC panel on evidence they had against Mr Billinghurst. But the case was thrown out of the High Court.

The video showed the men shouting ‘attack, attack’ before running at the suspect's car, smashing the windows and windscreen and telling him to ‘get out of the car’ before pinning him to the ground. 

The arrest took place in 2008 - but the IPCC investigation was not completed until three years later. All of the officers, part of the now-disbanded Enfield Crime Squad, kept their jobs.

But they have come under further 
pressure now after Mr Billinghurst claimed one officer turned up the 
music in his car as others assaulted him physically and verbally after 
they had pinned him down on the side of the road.

The
 suspect, who was later jailed for two months following the arrest, 
believed the officers were ‘muggers’ because most of them appeared to be
 wearing plain clothes.

He said the unconventional manner of the arrest was designed to 'punish, demoralise and humiliate' him.

He also claims police failed to say 
who they were. In its defence, the Metropolitan Police said officers 
shouted ‘police, police’ and put a blue flashing siren on one of their 
cars.

They said Mr 
Billinghurst ‘was informed that he was under arrest and the grounds of 
arrest as soon as was practicable’ - though it does not specify when 
this was.

Mr Billinghurst has also claimed the officers took and failed to return his iPod, CDs and mobile phone.

After
 going to Edmonton Police Station, Mr Billinghurst was taken to North 
Middlesex Hospital and treated for a cut on his face believed to have 
been caused by flying glass.

In
 its defence, the Metropolitan Police said Mr Billinghurst was suspected
 of driving a stolen car while disqualified from driving. Officers also 
claimed that intelligence suggested he would be carrying a knife.

Police have denied Mr Billinghurst's claim that they did not announce themselves as Met officers

The arrest took place in 2008 - and the IPCC judged officers had used excessive force at a hearing in 2011

They said smashing the windows was being used as a valid ‘distraction technique’.

The defence also questioned the likelihood that Mr Billinghurst could win the action because the incident took place five years ago.

Police said the arrest took place on the same road Mr Billinghurst's twin brother had died while being pursued by police - although the suspect, who was in the car at the time, has denied police were involved.

In 2011, Mr Billinghurst told Channel 4 News: ‘I personally believe that they may have thought that I have… I may have links or connections.

'It could have been - not pulling the racial card or anything – but it could have been that because I'm a male, I'm a black male, they could have thought that I…or I must know somebody in a gang, or I must know who stole the vehicle or where it came from, but they were mistaken.’

The Metropolitan Police confirmed the claim had been lodged, but said: 'It would be inappropriate to comment further.'
