A 27-year-old Pennsylvania woman's viral Facebook quest to find her birth mother who had abandoned her as a baby in a Burger King bathroom has finally paid off.

Katheryn Deprill announced Tuesday that she was reunited with her biological mother for the first time Monday 
in an attorney's office, with the meeting leaving her in a state of 'pure joy.'

'She
 is better than anything I could've ever imagined. She is so sweet and 
amazing. I'm so happy,' said Deprill, who became known as the Burger
 King Baby after she was found wrapped in a shirt and crying on the bathroom floor of the fast food eatery in Allentown. 

Happy reunion: Katheryn Deprill, pictured in her viral Facebook photo, finally met her
 biological mother who had abandoned her in a Burger King bathroom for the first time Monday in an 
attorney's office

Deprill began her quest March 2 by 
posting on her Facebook page a photo in which she held up a sign that 
said: 'Looking for my birth mother. ... She abandoned me in the Burger 
King bathroom only hours old, Allentown PA. Please help me find her by 
sharing my post.'

The photo 
was shared more than 30,000 times by Facebook users around the world, 
and Deprill's story landed in numerous media outlets.

That caught the 
attention of the woman claiming to have abandoned her, and she came 
forward to attorney John Waldron, who arranged for them to meet.

Deprill said she bears a very strong resemblance to the woman, whose name she wouldn't disclose.

'It looked like I was looking in a mirror,' she said.

Deprill,
 an EMT and married mother of three who lives outside Allentown in South
 Whitehall Township, said she embraced her mother.

'I
 got the hug that I had wanted for the last 27 years, and that broke the
 ice,' she said. 'I asked if I could have it, and she said, "absolutely," and just held her arms open, and the rest is history.'

The pair met for about four hours and exchanged contact information. Deprill said they plan to meet again.

'We are definitely going to have a relationship,' she said.

Waldron
 told WFMZ-TV that the woman said that, as a 16-year-old girl, she was raped by a stranger 
while traveling abroad with her family and became pregnant.

The woman said she hid the 
pregnancy from her parents because she was ashamed and, when she gave birth at home, felt she could not 
take her newborn to the hospital.

‘She left me somewhere she knew I'd be found,’ Deprill said. ‘She did not want to throw me away.’

Waldron said the woman, who is married, recently had launched her own search for the daughter she gave up.

Deprill said her mother expressed regret during their meeting. Deprill said she forgave her '110 per cent, absolutely.'

Speaking to WFMZ Tuesday, Mrs Deprill described her long-lost parent as a 'normal person,' ‘sweet’ and 'very loving.'

Attorney John Waldron, who organized the reunion in his Allentown officer just before 2pm Monday, told the station that Deprill's headline-making Facebook plea has made the search easier, but it also 'scared Mom a bit' because she wanted to stay out of the limelight.

After the 'emotional’ get-together, Deprill said her birth mother was very upset that she had to leave her as a newborn, and that it was not what she wanted.

The 27-year-old woman added that her mother quickly caught wind of her social media campaign, but decided to seek legal advice first instead of reaching out to her right away.

The Monday meeting was also attended by Deprill's seven-month old son and her adoptive mother.

One of the reunion's objectives was for Deprill to learn about her medical history, and she said that her mother provided her with all the information she needed.

The unnamed woman said that she hopes to be involved in the lives of Deprill and her family going forward.

Deprill, who was about three hours old when she was found, was adopted by a local foster family and she has since gone on to marry, work as an emergency medical technician and have three children of her own.

She told WFMZ earlier this month that she wanted to find her birth mother to ask questions she had always had about that day - and because she had always wondering if she had any siblings.

'I really want to see her and just 
ask her why and see if I have any brothers and sisters and anyone that 
looks like me,' Deprill said.

Support: Hollis said she was excited by the thought of her daughter finding her birth mother

Deprill's adoptive mother Brenda Hollis said she fully supported her daughter's plan.

'I think it's just kind of fun, like 
there's so many questions to be asked and it's just, I am so excited 
about it,' she told WFMZ.

A 
massive search was launched to find Deprill's mother after she was 
dumped in the Burger King, which is still standing in Allentown.

A worker told
 police he could remember seeing just one person who might fit the 
profile: a woman in her early 20s, with collar-length, frizzy sandy 
brown hair, the Morning Call reported.

He added that she was driving a blue 1970s car and that she'd headed south after leaving.

At the hospital, a nurse guessed that 
the baby was probably about three hours old. From how the umbilical cord
 was tied, investigators guessed that whoever delivered the baby had 
done so before.

Investigators dusted for fingerprints,
 searched trash cans, interviewed witnesses and followed up on seemingly
 promising tips - but nothing led them to the mother.

New life: She was adopted and now has a family of her own - her husband Mike and their three sons, Mason, 8, Gavin, 3 and Jackson, 7 months. But she said she would love to find out if she had any siblings
