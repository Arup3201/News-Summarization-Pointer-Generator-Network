Adebayo Akinfenwa might be a lifelong Liverpool fan, but ‘The Beast’ will be hoping to shoot down his boyhood club’s FA Cup dream with AFC Wimbledon on Monday night.

The lower-league journeyman striker with a 16 stone, 6ft 1in frame has never faced Liverpool before, and will be relishing the opportunity at Kingsmeadow. But his manager Neal Ardley has his own cup dream — getting revenge against visiting captain Steven Gerrard.

Gerrard scored both goals in a 2-0 aggregate win over Ardley’s Watford in the 2005 League Cup semi-final during the Dons boss’s playing days.

Akinfenwa has scored nine goals in 28 games for AFC Wimbledon so far this season

‘I played against him (Gerrard) loads of times,’ Ardley said. ‘We had a semi-final of the League Cup and we lost 1-0 in both games and he scored both.

‘The players and me want him to be involved. If we are going to put in a performance and get plaudits we want to play their best team. 

'I’m surprised (by Gerrard’s decision to leave in the summer). It’s rare to have a one-club player, he is a legend because of it and rightly so.’
