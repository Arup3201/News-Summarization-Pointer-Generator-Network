Andy Carroll faces another injury lay-off after leaving St Mary's on crutches following West Ham's goalless draw at Southampton.

The injury-prone striker is expected to have a scan on his injured knee on Thursday but the early diagnosis was he will be out for at least two weeks.

Carroll had returned for Wednesday's Premier League encounter at St Mary's after recovering from an ankle injury. 

Carroll came on as a second half substitute against Southampton and was injured in a challenge by Saints defender Yoshida. 

The early diagnosis was grim, considering his recent struggles.

Manager Allardyce was forced to leave the striker on because he had already used all his three permitted substitutes.

West Ham were also down to 10 men following the dismissal of goalkeeper Adrian for deliberate handball in the second half.

Allardyce said: ‘The sad thing is the injury to Andy which we can ill afford. It’s the same knee (he injured against Liverpool on January 31). 

'He got kicked in the back of his knee and he stayed on as nuisance value. We just hope staying on has done no more damage.’
