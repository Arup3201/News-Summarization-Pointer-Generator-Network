Large transnational companies are getting away with paying little tax in Australia by taking advantage of recent cuts at the Australian Tax Office, an outgoing ATO employee has claimed.

The insider said the ATO's Internationals department, which is responsible for making sure companies such as Google, IKEA, Apple and Starbucks pay their fair share of tax, has lost a large number of senior staff in recent years, The Canberra Times reported.

Funding cuts to the tax office combined with an Internationals department that is increasingly made up of junior staff has left the ATO unable to properly pursue multinational companies, he said.

In 2013 Apple paid $36 million in tax despite making $6.1 billion in Australia, while Google paid just $7.1 million despite making $46.5 million.

In 2013 Starbucks Australia had gone 13 years without paying any company tax.

The ATO insider said the 'big four' accounting firms that represent large corporations - including PwC, KPMG, Deloitte and Ernst & Young - were bolstered by the loss of senior staff and were attempting trickier ways of tax avoidance.

'That's more likely to be the case in a climate of a loss of staff, it has progressively become that way during the past three years, Internationals has dramatically shrunk in its technical staff," the mid-ranking executive, who did not wish to be named, said.

He added that new rules within the ATO restricting audits to a 90-day time frame also made employees less likely to pursue 'hard-nosed' audits.

'The Taxation Office is saying they want say, a 90-day turnaround, the office doesn't want a team to be bogged down in a case that might take months or years, unless they know there is going to be a revenue outcome,' he told the Times.

An ATO spokesman denied there was a 90 day time limit.

'This seems to have selectively chosen from blue-sky discussions about things that could occur in the longer term,' he said.

'The Commissioner ensures that reviews of multinational operations are thoroughly carried out according to case plans. Reviews and audits usually take a couple of years to complete.'

The spokesman said staff numbers in the Internationals branch had remained steady since 2011

'International structuring and profit shifting issues can be complex and that is why the ATO recruited further expertise into its International area, and into its advice and review teams.  The International area will continue to restructure as the risk environment changes,' he said.

'Multinational groups are reviewed by teams of compliance officers located in our Public Groups area.  Those teams include a range of officers of different seniority and experience levels who work together to make sure the right skills are brought to bear on each case.'
