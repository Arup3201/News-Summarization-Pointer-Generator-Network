A 17-year-old student has described his relationship with his 35-year-old English teacher accused of having sex with two teenagers as a 'teacher with benefits'.

Brainne Altice, a former teaching assistant at Davis High School in Kaysville, Utah,appeared for a preliminary hearing in Farmington to face allegations from the former students, and is now facing nine felony charges. 

One of the teenage boys, now 18, offered graphic details during his testimony about how he went from being Altice's student to allegedly having sex with her in his Farmington home.

Former: Davis High School English teacher Brianne Altice stands before the judge during her first court hearing in January in Farmington, Utah, accused of having sexual relationships with two of her students 

The teen testified that he was 17 years old when a relationship with Altice took place between April and June of last year, according to The Salt Lake Tribune. 

He says it began with kissing between class periods and eventually led to intercourse.

When asked Friday to describe his relationship with Brianne Altice, the teenage boy said she was his 'teacher with benefits.'

Altice, who was arrested in October for the alleged incidents involving the first student, now faces nine felony counts in connection with the allegations involving two of her former students.

Farmington 2nd District Judge John Morris ordered her on Friday to return to court on Oct. 9 to face three counts of rape and one charge of forcible sodomy.

Altice has pleaded not guilty to all counts. Her attorney Ed Brass argued she did not use her position as a teacher to persuade the teen into having a sexual relationship. He says she succumbed to the student's frequent flirting.

Under Utah law, a victim cannot consent to sex if the other person is in a position of special trust.

Altice was fired from Davis High School in February. She remains free on $10,000 bail.

On Friday, Brass peppered the teen with questions mostly concerning dates and the timeframe in which the alleged sexual contact occurred.

Prosecutors say the teacher acknowledged to investigators that she had engaged in sex with the 16-year-old boy on two occasions. 

But Brass has asked the judge to not allow those statements at her trial, arguing that she was intimidated by the eight to 10 male officers who came to her home last October to interview her about the allegations. Brass argued that the officers would not let her care for children, call an attorney or use the restroom for nearly four hours as they questioned her.

'Her statements were coerced and involuntary and were taken in violation of her so-called Miranda rights,' Brass wrote in court papers. 

'The evidence she provided was the product of that tainted statement.'

Altice, whose husband filed for divorce and custody of their child in December, was hired by the Davis County School District in 2004. She had been teaching at the high school since August 2012.
