A man accused of rounding up 200 Bosnian Muslims for slaughter in what is thought to be the bloodiest mass killing since World War Two has been found running a grocery store in Las Vegas.

Dejan Radojkovic was arrested and deported to his native country to face charges of genocide for his part in the Srebrenica massacre in 1995 which saw the murder of  up to 8,000 Bosnian Muslims.

Court documents show that Radojkovic and his family were granted refugee status and admitted to the United States in 1999 - four years after Srebrenica.

He is said to have two children, daughter, Ranka Shaw, who now lives in Bosnia and son, Ranko Radojkovic, who lives in Las Vegas.

Documents show that Radojkovic became a permanent U.S resident in January 2002 and used money from an insurance settlement to open the grocery, which sold food, tobacco, sundries and videos.

It is understood that his wife died in a car crash in Las Vegas in September 2000 at 43 years of age.

The business closed when Radojkovic was arrested in January 2009. He remained in U.S. custody for more than three years.

Officials have confirmed that he arrived in Sarajevo, Bosnia- Herzegovina, yesterday, after boarding an overnight commercial airline flight from Las Vegas accompanied by federal agents.

His lawyer in Las Vegas, Don Chairez, claimed that no evidence links his 61-year-old client with the execution of Muslim boys and men in July 1995.

'He is not a war criminal,' said Chairez . 'There is no evidence that Mr. Radojkovic ever killed anybody.' 

Prosecutors say that the father-of-two commanded a special police brigade that rounded up hundreds of Muslims in the Konjevic Polje region for execution.

Radojkovic will face genocide charges. He lived in the United States for 12 years where he ran his own business

But his lawyer refutes this, claiming that Radojkovic didn't know the men would be killed when he turned the men over to Bosnian Serb forces.

Radojkovic was arrested in 2009 for failing to disclose his wartime history when he entered the U.S and documents identify him simply as an ethnic Serbian refugee.

An immigration judge in late 2009 ordered him deported on multiple grounds, finding that he ordered or participated in 'extrajudicial killing'.

U.S. and Bosnian authorities confirmed that Radojkovic was handed over to police yesterday at the Sarajevo airport for prosecution based on evidence collected by investigators from the ICE Human Rights Violators and War Crimes Center, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia at The Hague and prosecutors from Bosnia-Herzegovina.

Nicole Navas, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman in Washington confirmed that Radojkovic was wanted on genocide charges. 

Announcing the Bosnian national's deportation Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director John Morton said: 'For the families who lost loved ones at Srebrenica, justice has been a long time coming.

'But they can take consolation in the fact that those responsible for this tragedy are now being held accountable.'

Morton added: '(America) does not serve as a haven for human rights violators and others who have committed heinous acts.'

Authorities preparing for the trial of another former Bosnian Serb military leader, Ratko Mladic, on war crimes charges at The Hague, Netherlands, said this month the remains of almost 6,000 people had been exhumed from mass graves in the Srebrenica area.

Mladic is standing trial before the military war tribunal on wider charges stemming from atrocities during a process dubbed 'ethnic cleansing.'

Mejra Dzogaz searches for the names of her killed relatives in a memorial plaque. Her husband, three sons and a grandson were killed during the Srebrenica massacre in 1995 by a Serbian army unit commanded by Mladic

Bosnia's 1992-95 war following the breakup of the former Soviet republic of Yugoslavia left more than 100,000 dead.

Chairez said: 'The government merely alleges that as an individual who was part of a group that accepted the surrender of these enemy soldiers, it is presumed that Radojkovic should have known that the Bosnian-Serbian military forces were likely to kill them.

'There is no evidence and there is no allegation that Radojkovic shot and killed a single prisoner.'

The appeals court in February denied Chairez's appeal, clearing the way for Radojkovic's deportation.
