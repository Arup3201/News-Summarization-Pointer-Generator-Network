 The Netherlands is known as the liberal bastion of Europe - with relaxed attitudes to drugs and sex - but when it comes to Christmas, things are a little different.

According to tradition, around mid-November St Nicholas, or Sinterklaas, is supposed to arrive in the country from Spain where he spreads Christmas cheer, with most towns holding parades.

However, Sinterklaas also has a helper - Zwarte Pieten, or 'Black Pete' - who has attracted criticism in recent years over allegations the character is racist.

Racist? As part of Dutch Christmas tradition towns hold Sinterklaas parades, where a man playing St Nicholas marches through the streets along with his helper Zwarte Pieten, or 'Black Pete'

Tensions: While the majority of Dutch people see Black Pete as harmless, the character has become a flashpoint for tensions in recent years over allegations it is racist

Dispute: Supporters argue Black Pete has nothing to do with race, but critics say an 18th century book called St Nicholas and his Servant, from which Dutch traditions are drawn, show the character is based on a slave

As part of the tradition hundreds of Dutch  paint their faces black, rouge their lips, and don fuzzy wigs, before marching through town centres with Sinterklaas, who is usually played by a white man.

While the tradition has been observed in the Netherlands for hundreds of years, recently it has been a flashpoint for tensions with the black community.

At one march in Gouda ninety people were arrested after fights broke out between anti-Pete protesters and those taking part in celebrations.

Supporters of the 'Black Pete' tradition argue that the character has nothing to do with race like American comics such as Al Jolson, and instead represents the black of winter.

However activists say that an 18th century book, called Saint Nicholas and his Servant, from which many Dutch Christmas traditions are drawn, clearly shows the character is based on a slave.

Division: Despite the controversy, that has not stopped most Dutch towns hosting parades featuring people dressed as Black Pete this year, including in Voorschoten (pictured) near The Hague

Investigating: Last year the UN were asked to probe the displays. Officials ruled the parades could be stopped if they risked law and order, but refused to say whether Black Pete was racist

Celebration: As part of Dutch Christmas tradition Sinterklaas is supposed to arrive in the country around mid-November from Spain where he spread cheer until December 5 when presents are exchanged

According to the book, Black Pete helps St Nicholas on his travels, before putting naughty children into sacks and taking them back to Spain when the celebrations are over. 

Last year the UN made a ruling over the parades after a legal case was brought, with judges saying that the displays could go ahead, so long as they didn't present a threat to law and order.

However officials refused to say whether or not the character of Black Pete was racist.

Recent polls across the Netherlands show strong support for the character, with between 85 and 90 per cent saying they want him to stay.

Following the ruling, right-wing party Livable Rotterdam hung hundreds of Black Pete dolls in the city in celebration, while liberal politicians said it showed a lack of support for the tradition.

The country's Prime Minister Mark Rutte also weighed into the debate, coming out in support of the tradition, saying: 'We should not disturb a children's party in this way.'

Support: Recent polls show that between 85 and 90 per cent of Dutch want to keep the character, but growing resentment has also sparked violence at some parades

Controversy: While the Voorschoten protest passed off without disruption, at another parade in Gouda, ninety people were arrested after activists clashed with those taking part

Despite the controversy, Sinterklaas parades have continued throughout the Netherlands, including in the city of Voorschoten near The Hague.

Dutch Christmas celebrations begin around mid-November, when Sinterklaas is supposed to arrive in the country from Spain, and continues until December 5 when presents are handed out on pakjesavond - literally meaning 'packages evening'.

Between those dates Sinterklaas supposedly travels around the country, along with Black Pete, taking part in parades and spreading Christmas cheer.

The tradition is taken very seriously by the Dutch, with news channels running a nightly report for children updating them on Sinterklaas's activities that day.
