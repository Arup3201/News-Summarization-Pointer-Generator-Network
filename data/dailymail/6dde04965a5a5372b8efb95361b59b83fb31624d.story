If you feel you have seen it all before, spare a thought for the young man convinced he is trapped in a time loop.

The feeling of constantly reliving his actions became so severe he stopped watching TV, listening to the radio or reading newspapers.

The 23-year-old even had to drop out of university and was tormented by further attacks when he holidayed abroad.

A 23-year-old British man has had to stop watching TV and reading books because he suffers déjà vu so extreme he felt he'd seen it all before (file picture posed by a model)

Psychologists diagnosed him with severe déjà vu, an extremely rare condition and the first known case to be triggered by anxiety.

The feelings he experienced were stronger and far more frequent than the normal sense of déjà vu, which is French for ‘already seen’.

The man said that rather than just a feeling of familiarity, he feared he was reliving the past moment by moment in a real-life enactment of the movie Groundhog Day.

Details of the extraordinary case have been revealed in a report published by the Journal of Medical Case Reports.

Although sporadic cases of severe déjà vu have been encountered before, all previous cases were triggered by neurological conditions such as epilepsy or dementia.

However, in this case the trigger was the man’s anxiety, leading scientists to believe that anxiety disorders could be more related to déjà vu than previously thought, and the peculiar feeling could be triggered in the same way as panic attacks.

Dr Christine Wells, a psychology expert from Sheffield Hallam University, said it could be the first case of a person experiencing persistent déjà vu stemming from anxiety. Past studies have linked the condition to seizures in the temporal lobe (the pink part of the brain, pictured)

Even though he knew that what he was experiencing was not real, over three years the episodes gradually grew in intensity until they became debilitating.

His case was analysed by experts from the universities of Sheffield Hallam, Exeter, Leeds, King’s College London and universities in Canada and France. All found his brain scans appeared normal.

Déjà vu - French for 'aready seen' - is a recognised health condition, explored by scientists across the world.

It is the phenomenon of having the strong sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced has been experienced in the past.

The psychologist Edward Titchener in his book A Textbook Of Psychology (1928) explained the condition as being caused by a person having a brief glimpse of an object or situation, before the brain has completed 'constructing' a full conscious perception of the experience.

That 'partial' perception then results in a false sense of familiarity. While scientists have spent years investigating déjà vu, a complete explanation is still lacking.

The condition is reportedly experienced by more than 70 per cent of people at some point.

A 2003 study revealed the condition is thought to occur in men and women across races equally.

But the research found it was most common in people aged 15 to 25.

Other studies have linked the condition with epilepsy.

There is a strong correlation between déjà vu and the seizures that people with temporal lobe epilepsy suffer.

A study in 2012 found people with medial temporal lobe epilepsy often experience deja vu as their seizures begin.

That has led some experts to suggest deja vu could be the result of neural misfiring, where the brain transmits signals randomly, causing healthy people to experience a false sense of familiarity.

Report author Dr Christine Wells, from Sheffield Hallam, said: ‘Rather than simply the unsettling feelings of familiarity which are normally associated with déjà vu, our subject complained that it felt like he was actually retrieving previous experiences from memory, not just finding them familiar.

‘Most cases like this occur as a side effect associated with epileptic seizures or dementia.

‘However, in this instance it appears as though the episodes of déjà vu could be linked to anxiety causing mistimed neuronal firing in the brain, which causes more déjà vu and in turn brings about more anxiety.’

The patient’s anxiety had been so serious he would take two or three showers a day because he felt ‘contaminated’ and repeatedly washed his hands.

He began experiencing severe and frightening cases of déjà vu at 20.

The early episodes sometimes lasted only for minutes, but other attacks could be extremely prolonged. At university he took the hallucinogenic drug LSD once, and from then on the déjà vu would last for several minutes at a time.

He told Professor Adam Zeman at Exeter University he felt as though he was ‘trapped in a time loop’.

Dr Wells said: ‘If proved, this could be the first-ever recorded instance of psychogenic déjà vu, which is déjà vu triggered by anxiety rather than a neurological condition such as dementia or epilepsy.

‘Distress caused by the déjà vu experience may itself lead to increased levels of déjà vu – similar feedback loops are reported in other anxiety states, for example panic attacks.’

Without knowing for sure exactly how the severe symptoms have been caused, Dr Wells said there was no way to treat the young man.

Bizarrely the man didn't suffer any neurological conditions previously reported in people who suffer frequent déjà vu

His problem was anxiety leading scientists to believe the condition may be linked to and triggered by anxiety disorders like panic attacks
