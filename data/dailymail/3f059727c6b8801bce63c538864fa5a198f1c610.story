A gang led by Phil Collins’s nephew recruited the two young women held in Peru on suspicion of drug smuggling, it was reported last night. 

Melissa Reid, 19, and Michaella McCollum Connolly, 20, were found with £1.5million worth of cocaine as they waited for a flight out of the South American country.

A gang led by Phil Collins's nephew - Philip Austin Collins - recruited the two young women held in Peru on suspicion of drug smuggling, it has been reported

Drug officers suspect they were recruited by a cartel allegedly operated from behind bars by Philip Austin Collins, son of the Genesis frontman’s brother Clive Collins.

On route: Respected human rights lawyer Peter Madden is on his way to Peru to represent Ms Connolly

The 38-year-old was arrested in Peru 
last year after £3million worth of cocaine was found on a yacht he and 
two other British men were trying to sail across the Atlantic.

A solicitor representing Ms Connolly flew out today for a preliminary court hearing.

Peter Madden from Belfast has told colleagues he expects to spend at least a week in Lima where Ms Connolly and Ms Reid are being held.

He has said that his client will plead not guilty if charged.

Mr Madden is one of Northern Ireland's best-known lawyers and has been involved in a number of high profile cases.

A former colleague of murdered human rights solicitor Pat Finucane who was shot dead by loyalists in north Belfast in 1989, he was involved in the legal representation of three Irish republicans who were arrested in 2001 in Colombia for allegedly training members of FARC. They eventually returned to Ireland in 2005.

Mr Madden said: 'She is saying she has done nothing wrong, that she is innocent and that as far as any offences are concerned, if she is charged she will be denying it.

'It could be a long time. It is a question of considering what the state prosecutor is proposing to do.'

He will discuss with local lawyers whether bail would be granted if she is charged. The experienced solicitor has already spoken to the woman and said she was doing as well as could be expected.

'If she is charged, there will be a trial so it could take a while,' he said outside George Best Belfast City Airport.

Miss McCollum Connolly and Ms Reid have spoken of their concerns that they 'are not going home soon'.

Family members of the two women are also said to be travelling to Lima.

One of the teenagers has allegedly 
told police that she collected the drug haul from outside a takeaway.

Miss
 Reid said she was called and told to go with her alleged 
accomplice Miss McCollum Connolly to collect suitcases packed 
with the Class A drug in the country's capital of Lima.

Yesterday
 it emerged that the women’s first formal police interview had been 
postponed because police did not have a translator.

It is now expected to take place today or tomorrow.

In an interview with the Daily Mirror,
 the women claimed to have been forced into carrying the drugs by 
members of a violent drug gang who put loaded guns to their heads.

Ms Reid said the men had information on their families, who would be threatened if they failed to follow the gang's orders.

She
 also revealed that the first time the women met was after being 
kidnapped and taken to the drug cartel's safe house in Majorca.

Ms Reid was the first to be sent to Lima, on August 1.

She was joined by photography student and former nightclub hostess Ms McCollum Connolly a day later.

She
 said they were 'coached' on what to say if they were stopped and told 
to claim they were 'best friends' who were travelling together.

The maximum sentence the pair could receive if convicted is 25 years in jail, but Peruvian police chief Tito Perez said they could be released within two years if they sign a confession.

He said that the pair are likely to be charged on Monday or Tuesday of next week.

Colonel Perez said: ‘The normal jail sentence for a drugs mule who isn’t found guilty of belonging to a criminal gang is eight years.

‘But if they confess they get six. Convicts sentenced to six years are being released from prison after two years with good behaviour.’

The allegations concerning Collins were reported in one of Peru’s most respected newspapers, El Comercio.

Locked up: The girls have been held in a prison in Peru for more than a week now

A police source told the newspaper: ‘Officers have confirmed the link between the arrested women and the mafia allegedly led by Philip Austin Collins whose organisation tends to use drug mules from the UK.

‘Although Collins is being held in jail awaiting trial, the drugs trafficking organisation he allegedly created in our capital is still active. The failed attempt to smuggle cocaine through these two women is said to be proof of this.’

A spokesman for Phil Collins said: 'This has nothing to do with my client so there is no comment to be made'

Miss Reid, an aspiring nurse, and Miss McCollum Connolly, a photography student, said they were given 11kg of cocaine in a secret meeting with an unknown man outside the Hotel Colonial San Agustin in Lima the day before they were due to fly back to Spain.

They have visited the hotel with police, who are trying to obtain CCTV footage of the handover and track down who made the booking.

In an interview from inside police headquarters, Miss Reid, from Lenzie, near Glasgow, said: ‘I was the one who went to pick up the drugs outside our hotel. 

‘At that point I didn’t know what was in the suitcase, drugs, guns or money and we were like, “we’re not going to do it”. But they said: “We’ve been watching you and you’ve got to do it.”’

Miss McCollum Connolly, who had been reported missing by her family in Northern Ireland before they learned of her arrest, continued: ‘I didn’t realise drugs were so big here but it happens all the time.

'The police have said they see girls like us all the time. We’ve resigned ourselves to the fact that we’re not going home soon and are doing jail time here.’

She added: ‘We’ll take responsibility for what was found on us but we didn’t do it of our free will, we didn’t have a choice.’

Miss Reid’s father, 53-year-old William, was yesterday on his way to visit his daughter, and was hoping to arrive in time for her 20th birthday tomorrow. 

Mr Reid will be carrying a letter from his wife, Debra, in which she urges her daughter to ‘stay calm’ and adds: ‘I can’t begin to tell you how much we love and miss you, and we pray that you stay safe and that one day you will return safely to your home here with us.’

A spokesman for Phil Collins said: ‘This has nothing to do with my client so there is no comment to be made.’

Party lifestyle: Thousands of young Britons head to Ibiza every summer to work in bars and enjoy the clubbing scene. Pictured, Ms Connolly who is believed to have worked as a tout and on a cruise ship

Like many young Britons, Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly had arrived in the party island of Ibiza for a summer of hedonism in the sun.

Ms Connolly says she had found occasional work as a tout, standing outside bars on the West End of the island's San Antonio resort, trying to entice customers inside. Ms Reid was simply enjoying a holiday.

But something went drastically wrong.

The pair allege that they were kidnapped by a gangsters and forced at gunpoint to travel to Peru to act as drug mules.

A 23-year-old woman, who knew Miss Reid, told The Times newspaper: 'She seemed just like the rest of us - clubbing, getting a bit drunk. That she might have been involved in anything like this is incredible.'

A friend of Ms Connolly told The Sun that she had been hired to work as a dancer by an exclusive to work on a cruise ship which toured the island.

But back in San Antonio, a bar owner who allegedly employed Ms Connolly told a different story.

A man, who gave his name as Andreas, told the newspaper he sacked her from working as a barmaid after only one night because she drank more than she sold.

'For every shot she sold she drank two. By the end of the night she was drunk. “I told her ‘f*** off!’ She was no good,' he said.

Spanish police have dismissed the girls' story that they were recruited by a cartel to act as mules insisting that it was more likely they were acting for financial reward.

But another Scot has told the Daily Record that he found himself in a similar situation with a drugs gang in Ibiza.

The man, who did not reveal his identity, said he was almost forced to make a drugs run to Peru after getting into spiralling debts with dealers.

He told the newspaper that it is easy for young people to get into trouble because of the hard-partying lifestyle and expensive rent costs.

He said he started selling off small amounts of ecstasy and cocaine but the money quickly got out of his control.

The 27-year-old, who said he eventually escaped via Madrid airport, added: 'What happened to Melissa could have been me and my friend standing there.

'I feel so sorry for the girls because I know what they’ve been through.'
