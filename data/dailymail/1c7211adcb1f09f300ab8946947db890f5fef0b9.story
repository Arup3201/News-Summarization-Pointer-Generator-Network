In the latest of our regular series on the travel habits of the rich and famous, TV icon Ruby Wax tells us all about camping in Wisconsin and beaches in Costa Rica.

Ruby Wax: Happy memories of Wisconsin and Costa Rica, not so much of Chile

Earliest holiday memory? 

Elkhart Lake in Wisconsin. There was a theatre camp nearby for children who wanted to act.

I would go and watch performances of Oklahoma! and hang around the stage door. No one broke it to me that it wasn't actually Hollywood.

Top travel tip?  

Get upgraded. If you're on a plane, say you have a condition that means you can't be around other people. And never accept a hotel room until you've had a good look at everyone else's.

Favourite place? 

Cape Town. It has everything America aimed for, but it hasn't been ruined by tourism.

It's difficult to get to and it has edge. The mountains are above you and the ocean in front. I own a place there and I just love it.

Favourite hotel?

Harmony House in Costa Rica. It's in the jungle and it's primitive, but in a five-star way. There's a beautiful beach and paths that wind through jungle.

Holiday disaster?

When I was eight, we were in Chile and my father said he would leave without me if I wasn't in the lobby on time. I was late, and he left me behind. He left 12 dollars with the receptionist and told me to get a taxi. I got in the taxi in my swimming costume and rubber ring. I was traumatised.

What do you look for in a holiday?

Go small and interesting. Guesthouses and home stays are fantastic.

Ruby Wax is bringing her one-woman comedy show, Sane New World, to St James Theatre London, March 2-14. Visit www.stjamestheatre.co.uk to book tickets.
