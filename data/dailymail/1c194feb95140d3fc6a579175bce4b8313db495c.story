A man has been killed and a woman seriously injured after a stabbing at a retirement complex.

Police arrested a 34-year-old man at the scene, in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, who is believed to be the dead manâ€™s grandson.

He was being held yesterday on suspicion of murder after the incident at the sheltered housing complex.

Attack: A man was killed and a woman seriously injured in the attack in Southend-on-Sea, Essex

Police cordoned off the street after the murder.

Officers were called to the flats at 2pm on Thursday by an ambulance crew after they found that the pair had received stab wounds.

A post mortem, carried out today, showed the 84-year-old man died of a single stab wound. The 81-year-old woman remains in a stable condition in hospital.

Residents were afterwards shocked to find blood splattered on the stairway at the block and also on the ground just outside the main entrance door.

An Essex police spokesman said: 'Detectives in Southend have arrested a man on suspicion of murder.

'A man and woman in their 80s received knife wounds and sadly the man died at the scene.

'The woman was treated at the scene and taken to hospital by ambulance. Police are currently liaising with the family of the man who died.

Investigation: An 84-year-old man died of a single stab wound and an 81-year-old woman is still in hospital

'A 34 year old man, known to the victims, was arrested at the scene by officers and is in police custody.'

An air ambulance landed close to the murder scene in Burr Hill Chase, Southend, but it was not required and an ambulance took the injured woman to hospital by road.

An ambulance service spokesman said: 'We had one casualty and conveyed them to Southend Hospital. Their injuries are not thought to be life-threatening.'

A spokesman for South Essex Homes, who manage the flats, said: 'This is a devastating and shocking incident for everyone concerned and our thoughts are with the families involved.'

The arrested man is still in police custody. Essex Police have not released the identity of the deceased man.
