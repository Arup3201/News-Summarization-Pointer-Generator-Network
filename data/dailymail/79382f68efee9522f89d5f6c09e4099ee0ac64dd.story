At least two suspects were interviewed over the disappearance of Madeleine McCann in the presence of British police yesterday. 

The pair are among four ‘persons of interest’ – or arguidos – who are being quizzed in Portugal as part of the latest stage of the Metropolitan Police’s multi-million-pound reinvestigation of the case.

Portuguese police, who are carrying out the interviews following a request from Scotland Yard, would not confirm the identities of the suspects.

But the
 suspects, set to be quizzed by local police in the presence of Scotland
 Yard officers, are said to be three Portuguese nationals and Russian 
computer expert Sergey Malinka, whose Praia da Luz home was searched by 
police shortly after Madeleine went missing in May 2007.

Madeleine, then aged three went missing from the Ocean Club resort in May 2007

As revealed by the Mail earlier this 
year, the men emerged as key suspects after analysis of mobile phone 
records suggested they were close to the scene of her disappearance when
 she went missing.

Yesterday,
 as they arrived for questioning at a police station in the Algarve 
capital Faro, the first two suspects cowered down in the back of their 
lawyer’s car. 

One hid 
behind a hoodie and the other tried to cover up his face with his hands,
 before dropping their guard inside. They left later without commenting.

A third person said to be suffering from severe schizo- phrenia was 
still believed to be in the police headquarters late yesterday and had 
yet to be questioned. 

It is not clear when the fourth individual will be interviewed.

All of those being questioned are Portuguese citizens, while one is believed to be of Russian origin.

hey have all been summoned to be interviewed but there have been no arrests.

In June, Portuguese and British police searched three sites in Praia da Luz but found no evidence relating to the case. 

Scotland
 Yard said at the time that ‘more activity’ had been agreed with 
Portuguese police and the searches were the ‘first phase’ of a major 
investigation.

Detective 
Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, who is leading the Metropolitan Police 
inquiry, was among those present at the interviews yesterday.

He declined to make any comment as he walked the short distance from his rental car to a back entrance into the station near the town marina.

A transit van with colleagues inside drove straight through the back gate into a covered car park sealed off from public view.

Mr Malinka, one of the suspects, told a Portuguese paper which named him today as one of the four so-called arguidos: 'I'm going to have to talk first with my lawyer.'

Eight other people, thought to be mainly former workers at the Ocean Club holiday resort where Madeleine McCann vanished during a family holiday, are also due to be questioned as witnesses.

The police questioning is expected to last until Friday.

Scotland Yard are working on the theory burglars killed Madeleine during a bungled break-in while her parents ate tapas nearby with friends

It comes less than three weeks after police dug up waste land near the Ocean Club and inspected sewers using a hi-tech camera over nearly a fortnight in a grim search for Madeleine's body.

The search and this week's police quizzes have happened at the request by Operation Grange detectives leading the British hunt for Madeleine.

Scotland Yard are working on the theory burglars killed Madeleine during a bungled break-in while her parents ate tapas nearby with friends - and then buried her body on waste ground in the resort.

Portuguese papers claimed this morning the witnesses and suspects identified by the British police are of no interest to the Portuguese police, who believe Madeleine was snatched by a foreigner no longer in the country.

Daily Jornal de Noticias said British police had brought sniffer dogs used in the Praia da Luz ground searches earlier this month back to Portugal with them - but it was not clear if new searches would be conducted.

Mr Malinka was quizzed first time round but not made an arguido at that time. He has previously denied any role in the youngster's disappearance.

He is an acquaintance of Robert Murat, who had also been an arguido but ceased to be a suspect in July 2008.

Mr Malinka said in 2007 when computers and computer disks were taken from his home during searches: 'The disappearance of a child is always difficult. No parent would want any of that to happen to anyone.

'So I wish and truly hope that Madeleine will be found and returned to her parents.

'I have a clear conscience. I have nothing to worry about.'
