Different reality: Andrew Firestone  married Ivana Bozilovic in 2008. The couple has two children

As he appears to leave reality TV behind him, former Bachelor star Andrew Firestone is now looking to politics - and handing a rose to Mitt Romney.

Firestone, 37, of Santa Barbara, has latched on to the California delegation that will formally nominate Romney as the Republican candidate for president on Tuesday.

Attending the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida, Firestone says that he’s hoping Romney will present solutions for the issues affecting America.

He told the Sacramento Bee: ‘I don't think anybody denies that this country is going in the wrong direction and we want a plan.

Firestone, now a married father of two, says he has come to Tampa hoping Romney will motivate Republicans.

He said: 'We want a direct idea of how it's going to be put into place to get us going in the right direction.

Firestone added: 'Politics are participatory and not just by the elected officials but by the private sector as well and being able to have their voice heard and being able to participate in the process.'

The winery owner says he likens the rigors of the campaign trail to competing in a dating reality show, but says there is one key difference.

He told the Bee: 'I think probably the difference between politics and 'The Bachelor' is the fact that the candidates I think in 'The Bachelor' are a lot better looking.' 

Backing: Firestone is attending the Republican National Convention in Tampa, where Mitt Romney is expected to be formally nominated on Wednesday

He added: 'But probably just as stressful as well.'

Contestant: Firestone took part in the third series of The Bachelor in April 2003, when he courted 25 women

Firestone is not the first of his namesake to enter the Republican fray.

His dad, former Assemblyman Brooks Firestone, was an avid supporter of Bob Dole, who ran an unsuccessful campaign to unseat Bill Clinton from the White House in 1996, according to KEYT.

Firestone took part in the third series of ABC show The Bachelor in April 2003, when he courted 25 women.

He eventually picked Jen Schefft and proposed to her, but they split that December.

Firestone went on to marry actress and model Ivana Bozilovic in 2008. The couple has two children.

Post-Bachelor, Firestone has also appeared on such TV shows as Iron Chef America, Celebrity Poker Showdown, and Celebrity Paranormal Project.

His grandfather, Harvey Firestone, is the founder of the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company.
