Louisiana has emerged as America's most corrupt state with the highest rate of convictions for people in public office, official figures revealed this week.

The Southern state came top for public corruption convictions with nine per 100,000 population. Overall Louisiana convicted 403 public officials in the past ten years.

The data was compiled by the Justice Department, covering the period from 2002 until 2011.

Florida had the largest number of convictions in the ten-year period at 618 but Louisiana came out ahead per head of population, according to Business Insider earlier this week.

The Southern State has been rocked by corruption in public office for decades.

Perhaps the most infamous is former governor Edwin Edwards, who had four terms in the 1970s, 80s and 90s before serving time in federal prison for bribery and extortion over a scheme to rig riverboat casino licenses.

On release from jail in 2011, the ex-con  launched himself as a reality TV star in a show called The Governor's Wife, following the 86-year-old and his 35-year-old wife Trina.

It is due to air in the fall. The couple had their first son in August.

The former New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin is currently waiting for his trial to begin in October after he was charged with accepting more than $200,000 in bribes, 
plus free trips and other gratuities in exchange for helping contractors
 secure millions of dollars in work for the city.

The charges against Nagin were the product of a City Hall corruption investigation in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Nagin pleaded not guilty.

Nagin was a political novice before he was first elected mayor in 2002, but Katrina turned him into a national figure with a reputation for cringe-inducing rhetoric.

A 2013 indictment accuses Nagin, 56, of accepting more than $160,000 in bribes and truckloads of free granite for his family business in exchange for promoting the interests of Frank Fradella, a local businessman. Fradella pleaded guilty in June to conspiracy to commit bribery and has been cooperating with federal authorities.

The Dakotas - North and South - came in second and third place for corrupt public figures with Kentucky and Alaska close behind.

The lowest conviction rates for public corruption are South Carolina, Oregon, Washington, New Hampshire, Minnesota
 and Utah - with 1 per 100,000 population.

Corrupt public figures in Louisiana have littered the headlines in the past few years.

Former New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin pleaded not guilty in February 2013 to charges he accepted more than $200,000 in bribes, plus free trips and other perks in exchange for helping contractors secure millions of dollars in work for the city.

Charges included bribery, wire fraud and filing false tax returns.

The charges against Nagin were the product of a City Hall corruption investigation in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.

It also resulted in guilty pleas by two former city officials, two businessmen and a prison sentence for a former city vendor.

Nagin's trial is due to begin next month after months of delays.

Perhaps the state's most infamous is Edwin Edwards  - who was governor four times in the 1970s, '80s and '90s - before being sent to federal prison for his role in a bribery and extortion scheme to rig riverboat casino licenses during his fourth term in the early 1990s.

Edwards, 86, married his third wife Trina, 35, in July 2011, shortly after his release following eight-years in federal prison.

The couple had a son in August. They are also the upcoming stars of  A&E 
reality TV show, The Governor's Wife, due to air in the Fall.

There are a variety of crimes which constitute public corruption, according to the DOJ report.

 crimes covers corruption related to campaign financing, fraud and 
conspiracy when it comes to the electoral process at local, state and 
federal level.
