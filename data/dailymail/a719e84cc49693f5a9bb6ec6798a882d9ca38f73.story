The basement of the Austrian house where Josef Fritzl kept his daughter as his sex slave for 24 years has been sealed with concrete.

Elisabeth Fritzl was imprisoned from the age of 18 in the cramped and 
windowless 18 square metres cellar by her father who repeatedly raped her.

She gave birth to seven children while held captive in the cellar - with three of them ending up trapped inside with her.

But the cellar has now been closed up with 200 tons of concrete after the house became a bizarre tourist attraction.

Walter Anzboeck, the liquidator of Fritzl's estate, has previously said the move is to ensure the dungeon - where Fritzl repeatedly raped his terrified daughter and refused to let his trapped children see daylight - can never be entered again.

The 76-year-old Fritzl was sentenced to life in prison in 2009 after being convicted of holding his daughter captive in a windowless cellar, fathering her seven children and for responsibility in the death of one of them.

He kept three of them with him and his wife Rosemarie, who was oblivious to what lay beneath her home.

She thought the three children had been abandoned by Elisabeth after Fritzl convinced her that their daughter had ran away and the evil rapist masqueraded as the children's grandfather.

It was the critical illness of Elisabeth's 19-year-old incest daughter Kerstin in April 2008 which finally heralded the end of the secret cellar and its inhabitants.

Under pressure from a terrified Elisabeth, who warned that Kerstin would die unless she received medical attention, Fritzl took her to hospital.

The house on Ybbsstrasse in Amstetten, Austria, became a world-wide symbol of evil after the revelation and planning officials at Amstetten City Hall approved an application to pull down the house in a secret closed session.

The task involved putting up special barriers designed to stop the demolition, which took two weeks, from being filmed by the media.

The 43-year-old and her children are now living in a remote town in the Austrian countryside.

Of the seven children she bore, one died shortly after birth, three were allowed upstairs to live with her father and mother Rosemarie, and the other three remained underground, never seeing daylight.
