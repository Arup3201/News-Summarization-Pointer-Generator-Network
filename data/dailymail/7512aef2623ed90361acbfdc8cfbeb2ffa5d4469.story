I've got a brand new training method for my abs and pecs – firing 70mph baseballs at them. Sounds a bit painful and, frankly, it is.

You simply stand in the nets in front of a baseball pitching machine and take it like a man when the ball hits you in the chest. If you don't believe me watch the video below.

I don't think it's likely to catch on as a new fitness craze - and kids please don't try this at home. Although, thinking about it, it's unlikely that many people will own a baseball pitching machine – but you know what I mean.

This week Spencer says goodbye to the Big Apple in true New York style with a trip along the Hudson: Left to right, Spencer, Proudlock, Binky, Lucy, Stevie and Sam

Seriously though, Jamie and I have been hitting the gym, or rather working out on our roof. Interval training, press-ups, squats, burpees, sits, leg raises, crunches, swimmers – basic gymnast conditioning exercises, high intensity with only 10-20 second rests in between reps.

I pop a couple of Forza T5 Super Strength in the morning then do 50 minutess of this physical torture on the roof.

Only problem is that we've had to do this pretty early in the morning as there's been a crazy heat-wave over here up to 30C. One time we tried the work out at midday and nearly collapsed from dehydration. You can see me and Jamie post-work out with TV presenter Marissa Montgomery. 

Spencer and Jamie have been keeping up their fitness levels in NYC, here they are pictured post work-out with TV presenter Marissa Montgomery.

So my advice is if you want to do the Forza high-intensity circuits – do it early in the morning or late afternoon. Then you will be ready for a bit of body baseball.

So we've finished our job in the Big Apple making Made In Chelsea NYC. All is left to do is the wrap party – which is clearly going to be huge – I'll let you know all about that next week, if I remember any of it. 

Everyone from the cast is de-mob happy now and looking forward to the last few days in this amazing city.

We have made an amazing TV show and we've made some new best friends here.

Morale couldn't be higher here and there's been a lot of fun and light-hearted japery - you can see me having a floppy hair length competition with Oliver Proudlock (he won clearly and he's very Proud of his locks, geddit?)

So, we are coming back soon, so watch out Chelsea, we're coming home.

Lots of love, Spencer xxx
