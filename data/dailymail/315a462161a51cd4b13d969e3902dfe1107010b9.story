David Cameron may have lost over 100 seats to Ukip in the local elections but Samantha didn't let her husband's news dampen her evening plans.

The Prime Minister's wife headed out to ultra-fashionable celebrity hotspot The Chiltern Firehouse for dinner and drinks last night.

Looking stylish, as always, the 43-year-old showed off her tanned legs in a black dress, which she accessorised with a leopard-print belt, black court shoes and black clutch bag.

Where's your husband? Samantha Cameron enjoys an evening at the trendy Chiltern Firehouse while her husband's conservative party took a battering in last night's local elections

Other famous faces at the Marylebone restaurant this week included socialites Zara Martin and Tamara Beckwith, as well as actress Kate Hudson and her boyfriend, Muse singer Matt Bellamy. 

The Firehouse has become a second home for the A-listers. Tom 
Parker-Bowles aptly described the venue as 'hotter than the surface of 
the Sun where even God would have to wait for a table'.

Last week saw the hotspot welcome David Beckham, the One Direction boys, Lindsay Lohan, 
Nigella Lawson, Cara Delevingne, Rita Ora and Kirsten Dunst (and just about every other celebrity you can think of).

Happier than her husband! Samantha was looking cheerful as she left the trendy restaurant in a stylish black dress

Chiltern 
Firehouse is part of a group owned by renowned hotelier André Balazs, the man behind 
celebrity favourites including The Mercer in Soho, 
New York, Chateau Marmont in Hollywood and Sunset Beach in Shelter 
Island.

Housed within what was one of the first purpose-built fire stations in 
London, in 
London's Marylebone, the building was designed in a Tudor, 
Neo-Gothic style by Robert Pearsall.

The Grade 
II listed Victorian 
building was built in 1889, and is regarded as one of the 
finest surviving examples of the Gothic architectural style used during 
the pre-war period.

She won't let it dampen her fun! The Tories, Labour and Lib Dems all saw their grip on local authorities eroded as dozens of seats fell to Ukip in local elections in England-  but Samantha appeared in good spirits

It
 closed in 2005 and André Balazs discovered the building around five 
years ago with friend and London property developer Harry Handelsman.

He revamped it with the help of Paris-based Studio KO and it now comes complete with high ceilings, sleek tiles and a bustling open kitchen.

The
 kitchen 
is headed up by Michelin-starred chef Nuno Mendes, formerley 
of Viajante in Bethnal Green.

Dale
 Osborne also rustles 
up his culinary magic there, alongside chefs from The Wolseley,
 Corinthia Hotel, and The Ritz.

Look who else stopped by! Kate Hudson and Matt Bellamy were also at the Chiltern Firehouse this week

The menu offers starters such as sea trout crudo, yellow mole, coriander (£11) and steak 
tartare, pine nuts, chipotle and Firehouse hot sauce (£12), while main 
courses include blackened salmon, sea kale, crispy skin and trout roe 
(£24) and pan-roasted chicken, charred leek heart, mustard tops (£26).

Earlier in the day Samantha arrived at a London 
polling station to show her support for the Prime Minister.

Despite
 early opinion polls suggesting the Conservatives would fall into third 
place, the Camerons looked calm and casual, and held hands as they were 
photographed by press.

A surge in 
support for Ukip has cost all the mainstream parties seats and control 
of councils, as Nigel Farage's People's Army marches into town halls 
across the country.

The
 Tories, Labour and Lib Dems all saw their grip on local authorities 
eroded as dozens of seats fell to Ukip in local elections in England.

With
 half of council results declared, Ukip had smashed through more than 
100 gains, with the Tories losing 132 and Labour gaining 151. Labour has
 gained control of five councils, with Conservatives losing nine and the
 Lib Dems two.

Ukip gains cost the Tories control of Basildon, Castle 
Point and Southend and David Cameron saw his party ousted from 
Hammersmith and Fulham, a flagship authority in the capital. The Tories 
were also defeated by Labour in Croydon.

They like it too! Gary Linker and his wife Danielle dined at the Firehouse on May 20

It's got Becks appeal! The Chiltern Firehouse,

Hot young things: Rita Ora, right, and Cara 
Delevingne love the venue. Rita is no stranger to the Firehouse and 
has practically set up camp there. The singer has popped by almost every
 day since its opening
