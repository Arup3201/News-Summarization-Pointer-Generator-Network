England World Cup stars put their club rivalries to one side as players from Liverpool and Manchester United competed in a basketball match.

The game paired Wayne Rooney and Jordan Henderson against Raheem Sterling and Danny Welbeck - with an (over) enthusiastic video commentary from Daniel Sturridge.

The Liverpool striker became so involved in what was, in truth, an extraordinarily average exhibition of co-ordination between professional sportsmen that he even turned away picture hunters by squealing: 'Not now baby! I've gotta record this'.

It's the shoes! Rooney was playing with the disadvantage of playing barefoot!

Sturridge may as well have taken time out for a few pictures since none of the four players on court managed to score a single basket - although Rooney's decision to play with bare feet can't have helped much.

Nonetheless, England's talisman was involved in the game's only highlight when he blocked a shot from the equally diminutive Sterling - not quite clash of the titles but enough to send Sturridge into hysterics.

Unfortunately, the video ends just as Rooney shoots from the three-point line with a nicely arced shot, the outcome of which may never be known.
