Sashaying down the aisle trying to look elegant is a daunting moment for any bridesmaid, but for one loving sister it proved far more difficult than for most.

That's because dedicated bridesmaid Lucy Morris walked her sister down the aisle while in labour.

Primary school teacher Lucy, 29, woke on the morning of the big day with contractions but put on a brave face and didn’t tell bride Emma, 26.

Her cramps became more intense throughout the day but she winced her way down the aisle and even posed for photographs after the nuptials.

It was only at the reception that the contractions became so painful she had to be rushed to hospital, where she gave birth to baby Izzy.

Brave Lucy - who was a week overdue - said: 'I wanted to watch my sister say "I do" and didn’t want to steal the limelight by giving birth.

'My due date was a week before the wedding so we always knew it was going to be close but I never imagined I’d go into labour while walking down the aisle.

'I don’t know how I made it through the ceremony, I was in agony.

'Baby Izzy nearly upstaged the bride, but I had made a promise to my sister that I’d be there no matter what.'

Lucy and her husband David, 29, found out she was three weeks pregnant in August 2013 and her due date was April 19 this year - just one week before sister Emma Bowker’s big day.

'We joked about how we were cutting it a bit fine but we foolishly thought everything would be fine,' said Lucy, of Bradford, Yorkshire.

'As it got closer to Emma’s wedding, the panic started to set in.

'She’d had to order me a maternity bridesmaid's dress and because I was chief bridesmaid, I didn’t want to be waddling down the aisle with my bump.'

As the wedding approached she tried every trick in the book to make her baby come quicker - but the hot curries and acupuncture didn’t work.

Her due date came and went and on the morning of her sister’s wedding, Lucy was woken up at 2am by painful contractions.

She said: 'I could not believe how bad the timing was but I was willing to put on a brave face so my sister’s big day wasn’t ruined.

'I was in such agony, I just kept praying my waters wouldn’t break before they exchanged their vows.'

Brave Lucy managed to hold on until after the ceremony, and even posed for pictures outside the church.

She said: 'I was halfway through my first mouthful of food at the reception when the contractions got deeper and longer.

'I was struggling to breathe and thought my waters were going to break.'

Her mother drove her to Doncaster Royal Infirmary and Izzy - now nine weeks old - was born 13 hours later on April 27 after a long and drawn-out labour.
