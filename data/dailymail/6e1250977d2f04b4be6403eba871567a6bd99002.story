Aston Villa defender Nathan Baker has fired a warning shot to Arsenal ahead of their Barclays Premier League clash on Saturday.

Villa claimed a 1-0 win over Liverpool at Anfield three days ago thanks to Gabriel Agbonlahor's early goal and Baker is confident his side can back that up with victory over the Gunners this weekend.

A win against Arsenal would set Paul Lambert's side up nicely ahead of a tough run of games, which sees them taking on Chelsea, Manchester City and Everton before the end of October.

Villa are second in the table after three wins and a draw and Baker believes, following their Anfield success, they can beat the best.

"We have done it at Anfield so why can't we do it at Villa Park? If we can beat Liverpool we can beat anyone," he said.

"We are getting stronger and stronger. We have a lot more experience in the team and it is paying off.

"This is the start of a hard spell and hopefully we can carry on with the confidence we have.

"We are dong well at the moment. We just have to keep our heads on and keep going.

"The signs have been there. There has been more competition and maybe that is why we are doing so well, everyone wants to keep their place.

"We have had a few more players coming with some experience and that has helped the younger lads come through."

The Liverpool win was Baker's first league start of the season after being kept out by the form of Philippe Senderos and Ron Vlaar, who missed the game with a knee injury.

Villa have kept three clean sheets in their opening four games with a new-look back four.

Alan Hutton, who signed a new three-year contract on Tuesday, has been recalled after a two-year exile while summer signings Aly Cissokho and Senderos have also impressed.

Boss Lambert believes the club are finally on the up after three years battling relegation.

He said: "I think the lads have become men. They have been excellent. The football club is a healthy place for it. If they can grow together and we get a few back from injury it looks good."
