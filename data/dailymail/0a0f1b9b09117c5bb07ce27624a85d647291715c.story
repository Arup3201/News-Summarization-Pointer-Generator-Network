Naeem Williams, who could face the death penalty after being convicted of murdering his five-year-old daughter Talia

A former soldier in Hawaii could be the first to get the death penalty since it became a state after being found guilty of murdering his five-year-old daughter.

A court in Honolulu convicted Naeem Williams of the murder of Talia Williams, who was beaten to death in July 2005.

Hawaii abolished capital punishment in 1957 before it became a state in 1959.

But Williams could still face a death sentence because the crime occurred on military property at Wheeler Army Air Force Base, and he is being tried in the federal system.

Jurors will now be asked to decide whether Williams should be sentenced to death for killing the five-year-old during the sentencing phase of the trial.

There have been 49 executions in Hawaii, the first in 1856 and the last recorded in 1944, according to the Death Penalty Information Centre.

The last time the federal death penalty was approved for a Hawaii case was for a drug-related murder.

However, the defendant took a plea deal that gave him a life sentence, then died of an apparent suicide about three months later.

The trial of Williams lasted nearly two months in Honolulu and was filled with graphic testimony about abuses suffered by the child at the hands of her father and stepmother.

The jury in the case found him guilty of all five counts including murder, aiding murder, conspiracy, obstruction of justice and making false statements. 

Williams' 
lawyers left the courthouse without commenting. They had argued in his 
defence that while he beat Talia, it was unclear whether he caused her 
death.

Florence Nakakuni, a U.S. attorney in Hawaii, said prosecutors won't be able to comment until after sentencing.

Williams and his wife, Delilah Williams, have acknowledged beating, confining and restraining the girl in the seven months before her death.

Delilah Williams also is charged with murder. She testified for the prosecution as part of a plea deal that calls for a 20-year prison term, but she has not yet been sentenced.

She told jurors she once stomped on Talia until she felt a bone crack.

Naeem Williams testified earlier this month that he beat his daughter often because of her bathroom accidents and because he was taking out his marital frustrations on the child.

He told the jury of seven men and five women that the day Talia died, he had punched her repeatedly after a night of drinking.

He struck her so hard in the back that she hit her head on the floor and appeared to have a seizure, he said.

The victim's mother Tarshia Williams, who is not married to the defendant but shares the same surname,  sat through the entire trial in the courtroom.

She said she attended every day because her daughter was alone when she went through the abuse.

She added: 'She can rest now that her killer is guilty of what he did to her

'Now my daughter can rest in peace despite all the pain she went through.'

When asked whether Williams should be put to death, she paused, gathered herself and said, 'Whatever they decide.' 

The trial's sentencing phase starts Tuesday.
