She may have lost her father in a hit-and-run at the weekend, but five-year-old Tatum Raetz was not alone when she graduated from kindergarten.

In a show of solidarity more than 100 of her father's colleagues from the Phoenix Police Force came to the ceremony in Anthem, Ariziona, yesterday.

Daryl Raetz, 29, was knocked down and killed by a car at about 3.30am on Sunday, as he helped make a DUI arrest.

'The purpose of us is to be here in proxy
for Daryl and to let her know that we're here for her,'  Phoenix 
Police Officer Keith Garn said.

When Tatum arrived at her school with her mother, Stephanie, about 100 officers in uniform were waiting to greet her.

They later filed into the auditorium, where they stood three-deep to watch the ceremony.

The kindergarten had initially invited members of Officer Raetz's squad to the ceremony, but word quickly spread, making it standing room only at the event.

Ridgeline Academy school principal, Keven Barker, held a minute's silence for Officer Raetz, before the graduation ceremony began.

When the little girl collected her certificate her mother had tears in her eyes as Tatum received a standing ovation.

'I hope she knows we're never going to replace her father but that we're going to do the best we can,' Officer Sara Garza, from the Drug Enforcement Bureau, told Fox News.

'Maybe not everybody knew him personally 
as an officer, but he's our brother and he always will be and we will 
support his family forever and this is just the first step,' she added.

Phoenix police Sgt Ben Kartchner told CBS5: 'He's left a precious child and a wife behind and it's our responsibility to make sure that they're taken care of for the rest of their life'.

Marcia Cassidy, the family's former neighbor, recalled how Tatum had looked up to her father.

She told AZ Central: 'She was just completely enthralled with her dad. They were a very close, very close family.'

The couple, who met when Officer Raetz was in high school, had been in the process of buying a new home when he died.

Tatum's father had served two terms in Iraq before joining the Arizona force in 2007.

An officer who attended the same police academy as Officer Raetz paid tribute to him this week, saying: 'He came across as so calm and in control and he just had an understanding of what it is we do as officers'.

Phoenix Officer Sean Reavie added. 'It wasn’t enough that he served his country, he came home to serve his community. That’s the type of person he is, you can’t make people like that; they come like that.'

The 24-year-old owner of the SUV that hit Office Raetz was arrested on Sunday afternoon for unrelated drug charges after a bag of cocaine was found in his car.

Jesus Cabrera Molina, an undocumented immigrant, was pulled over in a car matching the one that struck Mr Raetz, according to AZ Central.

Damage to the front of his car matched pieces of a vehicle found on the road where Mr Raetz was struck.

It is not yet clear if Molina had been driving at the time of the hit-and-run.

For his grieving colleagues, seeing Officer Raetz's daughter graduate from kindergarten helped to temporarily ease their pain.

'This is the most important thing we 
could do is to provide support from the family,' Officer Garza, a family friend, said.

A Go Fund Me page set up in memory of Officer Raetz has collect more than $11,000 for the family.

The Phoenix Law Enforcement Association also held a barbeque to help raise funds in the city's Sheraton Resort.

The event was a joint appeal. also sponsored by the 
Phoenix Professional Firefighters of Arizona, firefighter Brad Harper died in a separate incident on the same day that Officer Raetz died.
