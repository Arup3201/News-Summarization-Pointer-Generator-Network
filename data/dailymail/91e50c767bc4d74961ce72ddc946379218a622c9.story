Sheffield United's League One fixture with Scunthorpe United has been postponed due to icy conditions at Bramall Lane.

Referee Mark Heywood conducted a pitch inspection at 10am and although he believed the pitch was playable, he was concerned about supporter access in and around the stadium.

'I'm calling the game off on health and safety grounds,' the official was quoted as saying by Sheffield United's official Twitter account.

Sheffield and South Yorkshire saw heavy snowfall on the evening of Boxing Day, leading to treacherous travel conditions. Temperatures in the city are not expected to rise above freezing on Sunday. 

Referee Heywood said: 'The pitch, by 3pm, would be playable so player safety was not a concern. But the surrounding areas, including approaches to the Kop stand, were simply treacherous for supporters and even with the man power to try and clear it, it would have still been dangerous by the time the turnstiles opened.

'Common sense has to prevail and it simply isn't safe.'

The city was blanketed by snow, leaving roads and pavements icy and treacherous 

United's Managing Director, Mal Brannigan, said: 'We've had a lot of staff in and around Bramall Lane working to get the game played. The pitch is fine but from a health and safety point of view, access to the ground is treacherous.

'Financially, the game being called is detrimental to the Club but the safety of supporters is of paramount importance.'

The Blades, who are sixth in the League One table, now face further fixture congestion.

They are into the third round of the FA Cup and travel to Queens Park Rangers on Sunday January 4, causing the postponement of their scheduled league match at Notts County.

Nigel Clough's side also have a Capital One Cup semi-final over two legs against Tottenham towards the end of the month.

Scunthorpe, who lie 17th in the table, were hoping extend their unbeaten run in all competitions to 10 matches.

The Iron are set to play the winners of the outstanding second round FA Cup tie between Chesterfield and MK Dons in the third round. 

Three matches in the Conference also fell victim to the weather, with Telford v Gateshead, Alfreton Town v Dartford and Wrexham v Forest Green all called off following pitch inspections.
