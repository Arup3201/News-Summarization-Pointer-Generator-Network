A family member alerted Denise Fergus, the mother of murdered toddler James Bulger, to the Facebook page

The mother of murdered toddler James Bulger has called for a crackdown 
on ‘internet trolls’ after a sickening Facebook group was set up mocking
her son’s death.

James Bulger was two years old when he was abducted and murdered by Robert Thompson and Jon Venables in 1993.

The tragedy shocked the nation - but it is now the target of sick web trolls, who set up a Facebook group called: 'What happened to Jamie Bulger was f**king hilarious'.

A 26-year old man from Chorley, Lancashire, was being quizzed by 
detectives today and has had his computer has been seized for further
investigations.

Denise Fergus, 43, said that more must be done to stop malicious cowards
tormenting innocent people, while hiding behind their keyboard.

She said: 'Its sickening to think that these warped people want to bring
up all the terrible things that happened to James and worse still make a
joke out of it.

'Its too easy for these malicious internet trolls to hide behind their 
keyboards, more powers should be given to the police to fight them.

'These sickos don’t know or care about the difference between right and wrong.

'It is too easy for them to change the IP address and keep polluting the internet with horrible comments and harassing people.'

Denise’s husband Stuart, 37, added: 'It was our nephew who alerted us to the internet troll activity.

'They had set up a fan page called: "What happened to Jamie Bulger was 
f**king hilarious" and were encouraging people to ‘like’ their updates.

'The police have told us that they have taken one of the people involved
with the Facebook page into custody and his computer has been seized.'

Robert Thompson, who kidnapped toddler James Bulger at a Liverpool 
shopping centre and murdered him in 1993

Venables and Robert Thompson were 10 when they abducted James.

The pair walked the toddler several miles to a railway line in Walton, where they tortured and killed him, leaving his body on a train line where it was hit by a train.

After a public outcry and release of the haunting CCTV footage, the two boys were arrested about a week later.

They were convicted of murder and served eight years in prison before being freed in 2001 and issued with secret new identities.

It
was later revealed that Venables had sex with a woman carer at the 
secure unit where he was held as a teenager after James's murder. 
Venables was jailed again in 2010, when he was caught with of stash of 
child pornography
