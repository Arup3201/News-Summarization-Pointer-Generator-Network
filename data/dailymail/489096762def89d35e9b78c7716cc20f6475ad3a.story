Hospitals are in the grip of a crime wave, with police called 175 times a day to incidents on NHS property. 

The list of crimes in hospital wards, car parks and waiting areas includes rape and attempted murder. 

The official figures raise concerns about the safety of hospital staff and patients. 

Police are being called about crimes every 10 minutes, a Freedom of Information request has revealed

Figures obtained from 30 UK police forces through a Freedom of Information request showed officers attended 64,728 incidents at NHS centres in 2013 - 1,700 more than in 2012. 

While the figures did not include the Metropolitan Police area, they showed Greater Manchester Police attended 12,726 incidents and West Midlands received 7,132 calls in 2013, increases of 320 and 249 year-on-year respectively.

Police were called to cases including visitors sexually abusing staff, brawls between patients, racially aggravated behaviour and people brandishing lethal weapons such as knives.

In February 2013, Elizabeth Ward-Buck, then 51, attacked a nurse and a policeman after abusing Nigerian student Gina Thompson and her Spanish friend Barbara Iniesta in the waiting room at Ipswich Hospital.

She was handed a curfew and a suspended sentence and ordered to pay £265 over the violent incident.  

She asked the women where they were from, then shouted: 'You're coming over here and you're pleading poverty. We are paying taxes you a***holes and we are going down in this crisis.'

Staff nurse Marian Tolosa ran over to see what was happening, but Ward-Buck pushed her then attacked another patient.

The aggressive woman was taken to a side room by police, but she continued her rant and even tried to assault a police officer.

South East Suffolk Magistrates' Court heard that Ward-Buck had been drinking earlier in the day.  

Royal College of Nursing chief executive Dr Peter Carter said the rise in crimes was a 'major national problem'

Northampton Chief Constable Adrian Lee, Association of Chief Police Officers' lead for alcohol harm reduction, told Sky News many of the incidents were related to drinking.

He said: 'There was a time when NHS staff, through good motivations and a sense of vocation, didn't want to report crimes against people who were there to receive the service, but actually that's not appropriate because it gets the message across that you can go to a hospital and behave inappropriately - well you can't.' 

Irenee O'Neill, general secretary of the Independent Federation of Nursing in Scotland, said: 'Serious crime is on the increase in hospitals. I have had nurses who have been stabbed, have had broken bones or have had a knife brandished in their face. It is dreadful that medical staff trying to give lifesaving care should be at risk.' 

Margaret Watt of the Scotland Patients Association added: 'The problem is we don't have any security on our doors, like there is with airport security. Anyone is free to walk in with a knife.

'The security of patients and staff is paramount and these crimes are multiplying. This should give us a wake-up call.

'Doctors and nurses don't go to work to be beaten up. They go to help people and anyone who attacks them should be banned. There must be a system in place to identify those people.' 

Meanwhile, figures from NHS Protect released in November showed there had been 68,683 reports of assaults against NHS staff in the year to March 2014, prompting a leading nursing body's chief to call for more action.

Speaking to Sky News, Royal College of Nursing chief executive Dr Peter Carter said: 'Against 68,000 reported assaults last year, there were just 1,600 prosecutions. That's lamentable. This is a major national problem and something needs to be done about it.'
