Her first collection of lingerie for Marks & Spencer became the High Street giant's best selling designer range to date.

And now Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is back with yet another collection of her Autograph for M&S lingerie.

The pretty selection of bras, briefs, French knickers and camisoles inspired by the treasure trove of vintage lingerie the Devon-born supermodel has collected over the years.

Rosie's back! The supermodel's latest lingerie designs for Autograph at M&S are going in store now

Roses for Rosie: The designs shown on the model above come as a bra, £22.50, and knicker set £12.50, left and camisole, £35,  with shorts, £17.50

Soozie Jenkinson, Head of Lingerie Design at M&S said: 'In concepting the new Rosie for Autograph Summer Collection, Rosie and I selected the colours to look beautiful on glowing, sunkissed skin and to have an upbeat, holiday vibe so the palette and print we created for the exquisite silk lingerie was inspired by the beautiful leaves and petals of the stunning Sunset Rose, a blend of vibrant cyclamen, tangerine tones, hints of darker blackcurrant and bud green.' 

The collection includes a printed camisole and short along with silk bras, Brazilian knickers and a luxurious silk wrap.

M&S called the collection sophisticated and affordable - with prices ranging from £12.50 for silk knickers through to £22.50 for a silk padded bra and £59 for a wrap.

Vintage feel: This padded bra and knicker set comes in various colours and sizes

Purple passion: A bra and knicker set in the shade, left, and a silk wrap dressing gown, £59

Affordable luxury: This lace-trimmed set in green and pink is £22.50 for the bra and £12.50 for the knickers

The brand say it continues to be the 'collection du jour' for lingerie lovers whatever their shape as the bras are available in 30-40 back and cup size A-E (with selected styles available in G cup), the knickers in sizes 6-20 and nightwear in sizes 8-22.

They also offer 'everyday elegance' with the practical advantage of all silk pieces being fully machine washable.

As Rosie shows off her enviable figure in the M&S pictures, snaps of the 26-year-old on holiday this week wearing a bikini prove she needs no airbrushing.

The model is in the French Riveria with boyfriend Jason Statham for the wedding of  Tamara Ecclestone and Jay Rutland.
