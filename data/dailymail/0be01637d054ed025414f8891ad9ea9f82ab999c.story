Russia yesterday threatened to cut off Ukraine’s gas supply next month unless it gets paid up front.

President Putin said Kiev’s gas bill had reached £2.2bn and from the start of June Moscow would switch to pre-paid deliveries.

He first warned of the move in April in a letter to European leaders, whose nations are customers of Russian state-controlled Gazprom natural gas giant.

Ukraine serves as a major conduit for Russian gas supplies to Europe, and pricing disputes have led to shutdowns in the past.

Ukraine
 says it would pay up if Moscow restores the price discounts cancelled 
after the toppling of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych in 
February after months of protests.

Ukraine’s
 finance minister Oleksandr Shlapak said it would issue bonds to deal 
with debt as soon as the old gas price is restored, which is about half 
what is currently charged.

Russia
 denounced Yanukovych's ouster as a coup and sent its troops to take 
over Ukraine's Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which it annexed weeks 
later.

In April, a mutiny 
erupted across Ukraine's vast eastern industrial heartland, where 
pro-Russian insurgents seized government buildings and fought government
 troops.

It seems like a 
laborious formation. How about: Native Russian speakers predominate in 
the east and many allege the central goverment is a nationalist junta 
bent on repressing them.

The
 insurgents in Donetsk on Thursday announced the creation of their own 
parliament and Cabinet. The new defense minister is Igor Strelkov, the 
leader of the insurgents' armed wing who Kiev says is a Russian 
intelligence officer.

'A 
civil war is underway, and it's important for us to create a power bloc 
to successfully fight the Kiev junta,' said Yelena Korovkina, a member 
of the self-proclaimed parliament.

Kiev
 and the West allege Russia is fomenting the unrest in the east, and 
have imposed sanctions on Russia. Moscow denies involvement.

A
 European-backed 'road map' for peace, also supported by Moscow, got off
 to a rocky start this week. The first in a series of round-table 
discussions was held in Kiev on Wednesday, but the government refused to
 invite representatives of the insurgents, saying it wouldn't talk to 
'terrorists.'

The next round
 of talks is expected on Saturday, and the insurgents said it should be 
held in Donetsk. Denis Pushilin, speaker of the self-declared insurgent 
parliament, said it should focus on an exchange of prisoners and the 
pullout of government forces, which he called 'occupation troops.'

In
 Moscow, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich 
criticized what he called a 'stubborn reluctance of the authorities in 
Kiev to launch a real process of national reconciliation.'
