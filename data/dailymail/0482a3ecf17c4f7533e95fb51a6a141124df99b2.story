Thousands of children as young as eight years old have been caught with alcohol by police, highlighting the disturbing problem of child binge drinking.

Police in Burnley, Lancashire, have stopped more than 2,000 youngsters for drinking alcohol on the streets and in parks while others, including a 10-year-old boy, were admitted to casualty because of alcohol consumption. 

In a photo released by the force, officers are shown standing next to a haul of 280 litres of alcohol, the equivalent of 492 pints, which was seized by underage drinkers during a three-month operation.

Young drinkers: Lancashire Police seized 266 litres of beer and cider and 13 litres of spirits from 2,000 children as young as eight years old

Lancashire police said that the eight year old boy who was stopped by the police was issued with a 'protecting vulnerable people' referral.

From July to September this year, 266 litres of beer and cider and 14 litres of spirits were confiscated from children found in possession of alcohol.

In the three month period, 2,193 youngsters were spoken to, 154 licensed premises were visited, 76 youth referrals were issued, 54 young people were taken home by police, 23 youths were collected by their parents, six arrests were made, five cannabis warnings were handed out, seven fixed penalty notices were given and there were also two directions to leave issued.

The operation was mounted after figures 
revealed 184 children had been admitted to hospital in Burnley and 
neighbouring Blackburn for alcohol-related problems in the last three 
years.

Officers from the 
Special Constabulary worked alongside local neighbourhood policing 
teams in a bid to combat anti-social behaviour by targeting underage and 
vulnerable youths drinking alcohol.

Problem: Royal Blackburn Hospital where children have been taken to casualty after they had been drinking

Labour Councillor Tony Harrison, Burnley Council’s executive member for community services, said: 'The amount of alcohol seized from children in this operation is worrying and makes you wonder where they get it from.

'Residents across our borough are suffering from anti-social behaviour fuelled by alcohol and they will be glad to see operations like this taking place to tackle the problem.

'Burnley Council will continue to work with the police and other partners to deal with the issues surrounding underage drinking but we need support from parents and other adults, and shops that sell alcohol, to prevent it getting into the hands of children in the first place.'

Specials Inspector Luke Davis, of Lancashire Police said: 'Underage drinking is something that we will continue to tackle through the CAN operation and I am happy that we have managed to confiscate such a large amount of alcohol that could have been drank by underage teens with potentially dangerous consequences.

Treatment: Burnley General Hospital, where children had stomach pumped or were admitted because of physical injuries they had suffered as a result of alcohol consumption

'We know that underage drinking can make youngsters very vulnerable and this operation isn’t just about punishing those found to be drinking below the legal age limit, it’s as much about protecting them from getting into harmful situations and causing a nuisance to other members of the community.

'I would advise adults and parents not to buy children alcohol as there are all sorts of dangers and risks that come from providing them with it.

'We will continue to tackle this issue by running the CAN initiative.'

Labour Councillor Janice Hanson, Lancashire County Council cabinet member for public protection, said: 'Alcohol misuse can present health risks and cause careless behaviour in all age groups, but is even more dangerous for young people.

'Because young people’s bodies are still growing, alcohol can interfere with their development, making them particularly vulnerable to the long-term damage caused by alcohol.

'Drinking alcohol lowers people’s inhibitions, and makes them more likely to do things they wouldn’t normally do. Young people are particularly at risk because, at their stage of life, they are still testing the boundaries of what is acceptable behaviour.

'For example, young people may go further than they wanted to in a sexual experience after drinking alcohol. In the most serious cases, it could lead to them becoming the victim of a sexual assault.'

Figures released under the Freedom of Information Act show 69 under-18s were admitted to Royal Blackburn or Burnley General hospitals in 2010.

The figure rose to 71 the following year but last year the figure fell to 44 - although one of the casualties was a 10-year-old boy.

These children may have had their stomachs pumped after binge drinking while others suffered physical injuries as a result of alcohol consumption.
