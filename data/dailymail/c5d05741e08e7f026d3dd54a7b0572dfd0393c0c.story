A hairdresser who was stabbed to death in a carpark with a pair of scissors had reportedly lived in fear at a women’s refuge before she was killed.

Leila Alavi had taken out an Apprehended Domestic Violence Order against her estranged husband after years of turmoil but reportedly agreed to meet him on the day she was found dead inside her car.

Police painted a picture of a history of domestic violence inflicted on Ms Alavi as her ex, Mokthar Hosseiniamrae, stood accused of murder during a hearing at Parramatta Local Court on Sunday.

'It is alleged that the accused has physically assaulted his wife in the past, with incidents not reported,' police said while arguing he should be denied bail.

One of Ms Alavi's friends at her workplace, Benjamin Hair Studio, revealed it was not unusual for Ms Alavi to meet her ex Mokthar Hosseiniamraei. ‘I’ve seen him over 10,000 times,’ Meneske Cinar told the Daily Telegraph.

Hosseiniamraei was taken to Auburn Police Station for questioning and was charged with murder and breaching an AVO early on Sunday morning.

Court documents opposing Hosseiniamraei’s bail depicted a turbulent relationship between the pair who reportedly married in 2011 in Sydney.

‘The accused has shown a propensity for anger and being unable to control that anger,’ police alleged. 

A NSW police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia could not comment further on the incident as the homicide investigation is underway.

The former couple's wedding photographer told the Sydney Morning Herald Ms Alavi had been trying to help Hosseiniamraei despite a volatile relationship. 

'She tried to manage the relationship and help him out because she did love him and really wanted him to get clean. She still cared for him at the end too,' Fredo Monty said.

Ms Alavi had moved to Australia from Iran and was studying at Granville TAFE for her future.

'She couldn’t live in Iran and she came to Australia to live her life, to be a successful person but she’s dead right now,' sister Jacklin Poliena told Nine News.

According to the Telegraph, cafe owner Zeynep Zabinoglu was one of the last to see Ms Alavi alive on Saturday.

'We both got here at 8am and parked our cars… I said good morning to her and she said good morning and then we both went to work,' she said.

'Then about an hour and a half later I heard the other girls who work there screaming. I called the police and told them to get here as fast as they can.

'It was too late,' she said.

Mr Zabinoglu, who is a local barista in the area told 9News: 'It's such a shame. You can tell she wouldn't hurt a soul in her life. If you need anything she'll make sure she's there for you.

'It's really, really upsetting to lose somebody like that - a young person, such a young soul.'
