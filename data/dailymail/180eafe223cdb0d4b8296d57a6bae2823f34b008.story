A TV and video game actor was charged with killing and cooking his ex-girlfriend's pet rabbit, sending her grisly photos of the procedure and threatening to do the same thing to her, authorities said Wednesday.

Dimitri Diatchenko, 46, of North Hollywood, was charged Tuesday with felony counts of cruelty to an animal with use of a knife and making criminal threats.

He faces up to four years and eight months in prison if convicted.

Small-part actor Dimitri Diatchenko was arrested on Sunday after allegedly killing and eating his ex-girlfriend's pet rabbit. Pictured above in May 23, 2012 at the premiere for the film Chernobyl Diaries

Pictures of a rabbit named 'Miss Bella' are posted to Diatchenko's Facebook account. It's unclear if this is the animal Diatchenko killed and ingested 

According to Los Angeles County prosecutors, Diatchenko had been living with the woman for some time after their romantic relationship had ended.

She told Diatchenko that they should stop being roommates, prosecutors said.

On December 7, while she was out of the house, Diatchenko killed the rabbit, authorities said.

'Diatchenko skinned the pet, cooked it and ate half of it while sending her step-by-step pictures of what he did' according to a statement from the district attorney's office. 'When she returned the defendant allegedly told her he would do the same to her.'

Born in San Francisco, Diatchenko is an actor and musician. He mainly has played Russians and Eastern Europeans on television. He also had a small part in the movie 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.' 

Diatchenko also has had many voice roles in video games, including in several 'Call of Duty' titles.

His Facebook profile also shows that he appeared on the TV shows 2 Broke Girls and Bones. He posted two pictures to the social networking site of a rabbit named 'Ella'. 

Diatchenko was free on bail. His manager, Barry Bookin, declined comment. 

He is due back in court on December 30, when prosecutors are expected to request his bond be raised to $90,000.

On Diatchenko's Facebook, he posted a picture posing with the cast of 2 Broke Girls, pictured second from the left between the show's stars Beth Behrs (left) and Kat Dennings (third left)

Diatchenko also posted a still from the episode he appeared in, playing a Brooklyn, New York taxi cab driver
