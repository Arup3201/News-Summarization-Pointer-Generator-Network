A 'Wallace and Gromit' tax credit to stop film companies going abroad was unveiled by the Chancellor in his budget speech today.

George Osborne announced the plan - similar to the current film tax credit - after concerns that some of the biggest names in television were taking production overseas for tax incentives.

Julian Fellowes' drama Titanic and the show Birdsong are just two productions that have recently been made overseas instead of in Britain.

And Wallace and Gromit-creator Aardman Animations warned they would have to move production overseas because they could no longer compete in Britain.

But Mr Osborne said the new tax credits would help to attract 'top international investors' to the UK as well as retaining current talent.

In a personal jibe at Labour leader Ed Milibad - who has been compared to the pasticine figure - Mr Osborne said 'we want to keep Wallace and Gromit exactly where they are'.

Speaking to the House of Commons today, he said: 'Today I am announcing our intention to introduce similar schemes for the video games, animation and high-end TV production industries.

'Not only will this help stop premium British TV programmes like Birdsong being made abroad, it will also attract top international investors like Disney and HBO to make more of their premium shows in the UK.

'It will support our brilliant video games and animation industries too. Because, Mr Deputy Speaker, it is the determined policy of this Government to keep Wallace and Gromit exactly where they are.'

A spokeswoman for the TV Coalition, made up of some of the biggest names in TV production, said the tax measures could 'put an end to the exodus' of UK drama.

Research carried out by the group estimates that the proposed plan would generate around £350 million a year for the UK economy.

Andy Harries, chief executive of Left Bank Pictures which makes shows including Wallander, said: 'The proposed changes in the UK tax laws regarding television would give the British TV industry a much needed shot in the arm.

'British production talent is responsible for some of the best television in the world and at the moment many productions, which could very easily be shot in the UK, are being made abroad and many talented creatives are moving elsewhere.

'Left Bank Pictures are currently shooting two productions in South Africa - Mad Dogs and Strike Back - where tax breaks make it possible to make hugely ambitious dramas on a British TV budget and we have many other large scale projects in development that we would love to be able to make in the UK.

'The proposed changes will also welcome productions from around the world to UK shores and quite apart from the revenue that this will bring to our shores it will also help support the creative community in the UK and help train the next generation of film and TV makers.'

Glenn Whitehead, Executive Vice President Business at US cable network HBO, said: 'Today's news on a new tax incentive has turned the UK from one of the most expensive options into a competitive and affordable location. We would therefore love to bring more production to the UK.'

Mr Osborne said that Britian could be 'Europe’s technology centre'  as he unveiled plans to roll out super fast broadband around the country.

He added: 'Two years ago Britain had some of the slowest broadband speeds in Europe; today our plans will deliver some of the fastest - with 90 per cent of the population having access to superfast broadband, and improved mobile phone coverage for rural areas and along key roads across the UK.

'But we should not be complacent by saying it is enough to be the best in Europe when countries like Korea and Singapore do even better. So today we’re funding ultra fast broadband and wi-fi in ten of the UK’s largest cities.

Belfast, Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Leeds, Manchester, Newcastle and London.

Now my Honourable Friend for Brighton Kempton asked me to help small cities too - no doubt with his own city in mind.
