A Sydney mother has been left shaken after a stranger allegedly tried to snatch her 14-month-old baby from his pram.

Christine Thomas was jogging on her usual route at 10.30am  in Balmain, Sydney's inner west, with her son in his pram on Tuesday morning.

Although a man on a bike was able to scare off the alleged baby-snatcher, the 41-year-old took to social media and warned other mothers of the potential danger.

Christine Thomas nearly had her 14-month-old baby taken from her by a stranger dressed in a blue parka and blue scarf

The 41-year-old was jogging on her usual route at 10.30am in Balmain, Sydney's inner west, with her son in his pram on Tuesday morning 

Ms Thomas told Kidspot that  a man ran towards her and tried to take the pram out of her hands.

'He was so strong,' she said. 'I just remembered thinking, what am I going to do if he gets my son? How am I going to stop him?'

But luckily another man behind Ms Thomas, steered his bike into the alleged attacker.

The first man fled from the scene but the ordeal left Ms Thomas in tears.

She regrets that she wasn't able to thank the man who helped her nor get his name.

'I was in too much shock. With everything going on in the world today, I kept thinking, what if that guy had killed me or my child? What if he was looking to steal a random off the street?'

The man, who saved her son Myles who was asleep during the whole incident, then walked Ms Thomas back to her car.

She says that she then reported the incident to police and later posted the scare on a Facebook group.

The story was met with horror by other mothers, while one wrote: 'I think I saw him yesterday morning, too, wearing shorts and a blue (windbreaker type jacket) with his [hood] up running'. 

Ms Thomas described the man as being around 175cm tall,  a blue ski parka, dark glasses and jeans.

The Daily Telegraph reports the man was also wearing a blue Bulldogs football scarf which was wrapped around his face. 

Police are investigating the matter and have appealed for any witnesses to come forward.
