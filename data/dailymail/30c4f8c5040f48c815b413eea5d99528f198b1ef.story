Director Kevin Smith has landed in hot water for sharing on social media a heart-breaking photo showing him cradling the body of his dying dog Mulder.

The 44-year-old filmmaker and actor posted a message on Facebook Wednesday morning telling his fans that his faithful 17-year-old dog, Mulder, was sick and nearing the end.

Hours later Smith posted the sad news that his Mulder, 'My Buddy-Man' had passed away, writing, 'Thank you for 17 years of sheer joy and affection. It took a dog like you to make me a better person.'

Last goodbye: Director Kevin Smith shared this touching image of him embracing the body of his very sick dog, Mulder, on his social media accounts Wednesday

Target of criticism: The director of Clerks and Tusk was called out by some Reddit users for allegedly trying to draw attention to himself by sharing the photo

In an earlier post, Smith had outlined the deep love he had for his dog and how he took him everywhere with him after the 17-year-old pooch's health began to fail.

‘As I've spent the last year carrying him around like Hodor,’ Smith wrote, referring to a character from Game of Thrones, ‘I'm not taking this terribly well. 

'They never tell you when you get a dog, but there is a price to pay for being the recipient of 17 years of unconditional love, loyalty and companionship: they take a huge chunk of your heart with them when they go.’

He then added: ‘Mulder was beyond worth it. F***, this hurts...’

At around 1pm on Wednesday, the director of cult film Clerks and the recent horror flick Tusk, posted an update announcing the passing of his four-legged companion.

Clearing up any misconception that the earlier picture was taken after Mulder had passed away, Smith revealed in a later Facebook update that he was holding his dog in the picture to reduce his suffering as he reached the end.

'He was still fighting to stay above ground - which is why I'm holding him on his back (he couldn't breath laying on his sides or his stomach anymore). We didn't take any pics of him after he was gone,' wrote Smith on Wednesday.

The moving tribute to the pet has been shared on Facebook more than 13,370 times as of Wednesday night, and counting. Smith also posted the image on his Twitter and Instagram accounts.

More than 40,000 Facebook users left comments on Smith’s wall expressing their condolences on his loss, many of them sharing photos of the pets they had lost.

Military veteran Jason Ray wrote: ‘I'm very sorry sir. My military working dog passed away recently. I understand what you're going through. I know I'm just some dude on Facebook but if there is anything I can do to help just say the word. His name is Doki. I'm not trying to take away from your post at all. Just offering my support.’

Another user Jamie Blanche said: ‘I know exactly what you're going through. I had to put my Sam down last September. He was my best pal for 14 years and he died of cancer of the bladder.’

Not everyone, however, was on board with Kevin Smith’s decision to share his grief with the world.

In a later post on his account, the Los Angeles-based filmmaker, who is married with a grown daughter, explained that someone posted his photo with Mulder on Reddit ‘without the relevant text,’ prompting some users to call him out for being an ‘attention-whore.’

The director, who is known for keeping in touch with his fan base, responded to the accusation by saying that he took to social media to announce the death of his dog in part to unload the emotional burden.

Outpouring of support: The moving tribute to the pet has been shared on Facebook more than 13,370 times as of Wednesday night and has drawn tens of thousands of comments from users expressing their sympathies 

‘This wasn't about look at ME - this was about look at HIM. And based on the amount of likes and comments the posting drew, I don't think the image came across to the intended audience as in poor taste.

The grieving dog owner went on to say that he can see how someone could misconstrue his post as a cry for attention, but he insisted that it was not his intent.

‘I was in pain and I just wanted to hear from people who knew that distinct pain of losing a dog. And I'm glad I did, because I got to read some amazing stories people posted about the lives and deaths of their pets.

‘It was therapeutic for me. We don't really do wakes and funerals for our pets, so we usually miss that important step of the grieving process: grieving with others, sharing stories about the departed.’

Smith, the creator of the fictional characters Jay and Silent Bob, also has a Dachshund named Shecky and a large brown lab named Louis.

Mulder’s companion Scully, a yellow Labrador, passed away at age 14 in 2012.
