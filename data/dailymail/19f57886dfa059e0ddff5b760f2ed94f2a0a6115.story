Just in time for margarita season, a lime shortage in Mexico is causing a shortage of the cirtus across the U.S. with prices inflating to as high as $1.50 for a single fruit.

Heaving rains in Mexico, the world's largest lime producer and where the U.S. get's 97 per cent of its supply, combined with a crop disease are contributing to the short supply of juicy limes.

But more concerning is the crime caused by the Knights Templar drug cartel in the state of Michoacan, where the most limes are produced.

Pricey: A shortage in Mexico, where 97 per cent of the U.S.'s  limes are produced, has caused prices to skyrocket. At Gristedes market in New York, prices for a single lime are $1.50 while they hover just under $1 at Cal-Mart Grocer in San Francisco (above)

Lime farmers have been reporting that cartel members are raiding their groves and hijacking delivery trucks. Many growers won't even send their trucks on the road.

While importers are now turning to Columbia to supplement the supply of limes, the shortage is still causing a panic with restaurant and bar owners who are now paying more than six times what they used to for a case of the fruit.

What cost about $30 for a case months ago, is now closer to $200 and the limes aren't even that usable.

Because of the shortage, growers are stripping all of the fruit off the trees, rendering a majority of small, golf ball-sized fruit that are rock hard.

Alternatives: The shortage is causing restaurants and bars to charge more for lime-based drinks, or substitute them partially or completely with lemons. Above limes are sorted in Mihoacan, Mexico last November

Some, like Mexican chain Rosa Mexicano, are taking the hit, hoping the shortage will pass without charging their customers extra.

'I can tell you this time last year we were paying approximately $36 a case,' manager Jay Holmes told CNN earlier this month. 'The first delivery this morning was $110 a case. We've not passed that onto the guest and don't plan to.'

At grocery stores, the shortage has led the price of limes to skyrocket to as high as $1.50 each at Gristedes market in New York City.

Restaurants are passing on the extra charge as well, upping the price on their margaritas, while some are getting inventive by doing without limes completely. 

Winners and losers: One man has taken advantage of the shortage by driving a U-Haul truck to and from Florida and selling limes at New York restaurants and bars. Above a man unloads a truck-load full of Mexican limes at a packing plant in Michoacan

Ricky Camacho, the executive chef at Manhattan's Anejo, has created his own lemon margarita which he told the New York Post is 'just as amazing and refreshing'. Other bartenders are mixing lime with lemon juice to make more economical mixes for their cosmopolitans and margaritas.

Of course there are winners in the shortage as well, those who are taking advantage of the crisis to make an extra buck.

An unidentified man in New York has been driving a rented U-Haul truck to and from Florida to sell limes to local restaurants and bars.

'He saw an opportunity to profit from this,' Esteban Ordóñez, owner of Burning Waters Cantina in Greenwich Village, told the post. 'He’s working to prepare A/C units, and he’s getting ready for the summer, and he put one and one together.'

It's also causing a boon in Mexico where they've never seen such high demand for the fruit.

Growers like Juan Leane Malpica in Morelos are using the extra profits to expand and upgrade fertilizer and irrigation systems.
