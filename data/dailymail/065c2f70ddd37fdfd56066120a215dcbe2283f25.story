Dentist Joyce Trail, 48, who has been jailed for conning the NHS out of £1.5million by pretending she had fitted dentures to dead patients

A dentist swindled over £1.5million from the NHS by pretending she had fitted dentures to dead patients in order to fund her luxury lifestyle.

Joyce Trail, 50, splashed out on designer clothes, bags, jewellery, luxury homes, £1,000-a-night hotel suites in the Caribbean and America and a designer shoe collection 'to make Imelda Marcos' proud.

The grandmother, who also used the money to send her granddaughters to a posh private school, was jailed for seven years today.

She made thousands of false claims for dental work which had not been done - sometimes using the names of deceased patients.

A court heard the scam was one of the biggest NHS frauds ever uncovered by police.

Jailing Trail at Coventry Crown Court, Judge Peter Carr said her offences had been motivated by pure greed.

Trail is thought to have netted around £1.4million by making bogus claims for dental work which she had not performed between April 2006 and March 2009.

She submitted over 7,000 dodgy invoices
for lucrative denture work over a three-year period that was never 
actually carried out at her practice in Handsworth, Birmingham.

A further £94,000 in employer’s contributions was paid into Trail’s pension during the period of the indictment, bringing total proceeds from the fraud to £1,556,743.

Judge Carr was told that the sum could have instead funded 73 newly-qualified nurses for a year, 221 hip replacements, or life-saving drugs for 51 leukaemia patients.

Trail, from Little Aston, Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, and her daughter Nyri Stirling, 33 - who also worked at the practice  - were convicted of conspiracy to defraud in July following a five-week trial at Birmingham Crown Court.

The jury heard Trail amassed a collection of Jimmy Choo shoes that the judge said would have made 'Imelda Marcos proud.'

Jailing Trail, who pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice before her trial, Judge Carr said he believed the roots of the offences lay in an earlier NHS investigation into her conduct.

The judge told her: 'In 2004 you were investigated. The result of that investigation was that it was decided that you had over-claimed in relation to services you provided.

'You were ordered to pay back over £320,000.'

She paid the money back but she continued to defraud the health service until 2009.

Jailing her, Judge Carr said: 'Police found
jewellery in your large house, designer clothing, designer shoes, 
foreign currency and all the trappings of high living.

'It is my view that, having been ordered to pay back such a large sum, and not wishing to forgo the lifestyle to which you by then had become accustomed, you deliberately set out to ensure that you did not.

'You knew as a result of that investigation exactly what was required to try and ensure that you fraud was not discovered.

'You did what you did out of pure greed.'

Miranda Moore QC, prosecuting, told the court the NHS said the losses meant it was unable to provide a host of vital services.

She said: 'What they could have done with that money included paying for 73 newly qualified nurses, 22 hip replacements or life-saving cancer drugs for 51 Leukaemia patients for a year.'

It also emerged that Trail paid for Stirling’s two daughters to attend an expensive private school.

Nyri Stirling was jailed for two years after being convicted of conspiracy to defraud.

Addressing Stirling, of Oldbury, West Midlands, Judge Carr said: 'It is a fact for the most part that people who organise and carry out out frauds like your mother did cannot operate those frauds successfully without the help of others.'

Mother and daughter both wept as their sentences were handed down.

The NHS will attempt to claw back some of the money that Trail claimed next year under the Proceeds of Crime Act.
