A New York healthcare firm is under fire for allegedly forcing employees to join prayer circles, thank God for having jobs and say 'I love you' to co-workers and managers.

The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed a discrimination lawsuit Wednesday against United Health Programs of America and its parent company, Cost Containment Group.

The EEOC says the Long Island company required employees to practice a belief system called 'Harnessing Happiness' or 'Onionhead.' It includes praying, discussing personal matters with colleagues and reading spiritual texts.

Under fire: The EEOC has sued Syosset-based United Health Programs of America owned by Cost Containment Group, claiming that staff have been forced to practice the Harnessing Happiness or Onionhead belief system

The agency says employees of the Syosset-based firm who objected were disciplined or terminated.

Staffers were required to wear 'Onionhead' buttons to work; read spiritual texts; keep a dim lighting in the office and burn candles, the lawsuit stated.

'Onionhead' was created by a relative of the company owners, according to court filings. The EEOC stated the New-Age religious practices have been in place since 2007.

‘While religious or spiritual practices may indeed provide comfort and community to many people, it is critical to be aware that federal law prohibits employers from coercing employees to take part in them,’ Sunu Chandy, senior trial attorney for the EEOC, told Newsday.

The Harnessing Happiness Foundation describes 'Onionhead' as a belief system that was created two decades ago by a mother and daughter to guide people to more harmonious and successful lives.

'Cult of happiness:' The Harnessing Happiness Foundation describes 'Onionhead' as a belief system that was created 20 years ago by a mother and daughter, who are reportedly related to the owner of the insurance company

Inappropriate: Staffers were required to tell one another and managers 'I love you,' and thank god for having jobs

The complaint against the Long Island-based insurance firm and its parent company was first brought by three former employees, according to New York Daily News.

Elizabeth Ontaneda, Francine Pennisi and Faith Pabon allegedly had been demoted and later let go for refusing to attend meetings with Denali Jordan to discuss divine paths and moral codes.

Jordan reportedly was in charge of enforcing 'Onionhead' practices in the workplace.

After Pennisi publicly denounced 'Onionhead,' declaring that she was Catholic, the woman was ousted from her office and replaced with a statue of Buddha, according to the lawsuit.

Ms Jordan reportedly attributed the woman's resistance to the 'Onionhead' way to demonic intervention.

Fringe faith: Since 2007, company employees have been forced to wear 'Onionhead' buttons and read spiritual texts

Zen retaliation: When a staffer refused to discuss moral codes with a supervisor, she was allegedly banished from her office and replaced with a Buddha statue

The EEOC is asking a judge to stop the practices and ensure employees receive back pay and other compensation.

Both Denali Jordan and United Health Programs of
 America have denied the allegations laid out in the federal lawsuit, 
deeming them without merit.
