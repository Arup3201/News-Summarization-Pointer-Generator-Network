Toulon lock Romain Taofifenua has received a three-week ban after being cited for kicking an opponent in the head.

The France international forward was reported by match citing commissioner Peter Larter following the offence on Ulster centre Stuart Olding during a European Champions Cup pool game in Belfast last Saturday.

Tournament organisers said Taofifenua was suspended following a disciplinary hearing in Dublin on Thursday.

In a statement, European Professional Club Rugby said: 'The independent judicial officer, Christopher Quinlan (England), heard evidence from Taofifenua, from Toulon's legal representative John O'Donnell SC and from the tournament disciplinary officer.

'In upholding the citing complaint, the judicial officer determined that the offence was reckless and warranted a red card, but that it was at the low end (four weeks) of the IRB (International Rugby Board) sanctions for offences of this nature.

'As there were no aggravating factors, he reduced the suspension by one week due to the player's good conduct during the hearing.'

Taofifenua, who has the right of appeal, will be free to play again on November 17.
