The judge behind a ‘whitewash’ review of extradition has admitted he had not met Gary McKinnon, the Asperger’s sufferer who faces being sent to the U.S. for trial on hacking charges.

Lord Justice Scott Baker told MPs that while preparing his report into the treaty between Britain and the U.S. he did not speak to Mr McKinnon, his mother Janis, his legal team or any other suspects facing extradition to America.

Instead, the former high court judge travelled to the U.S. to spend a week with prosecutors involved in extradition cases.

MPs passed a motion this month for 
‘urgent reform’ of the treaty. Critics say it is biased in favour of 
America, which requires stronger evidence than the UK for the 
extradition of its citizens.

But the Baker review rejected that charge, and found there was no 
significant difference in the legal protection available in the two 
countries. He defended his review on Tuesday before MPs on the Home 
Affairs Committee.  

He insisted that not a single Briton sent to the U.S. would have escaped
extradition if the wording of the treaty had been the same in both 
countries.

But chairman Keith Vaz asked why he had not spoken to British
citizens affected by the treaty, such as Mr McKinnon – the subject of 
the Mail’s Affront To British Justice campaign – David Birmingham or 
Babar Ahmad.

Mr McKinnon, who is autistic, admits hacking into Nasa and Pentagon computers to look for evidence of ‘little green men’.  

Mr Birmingham was one of the ‘NatWest Three’ charged with fraud in the 
U.S. in 2002, extradited there in 2006 and sentenced to 37 months in 
jail in 2010. He has since been released.

Babar Ahmad, 37, of Tooting, South West London, was arrested under a 
U.S. extradition request in 2004 on suspicion of supporting terrorism 
and has been detained without charge in a British jail ever since.

Mr Vaz said: ‘As part of your review you didn’t actually meet Janis McKinnon or any representatives of the Babar Ahmad case.

Janis Sharp has been leading the fight to stop her son Gary from being extradited to the U.S.

‘So although you managed to go to Washington for a week you weren’t able
to call in people like David Birmingham, you weren’t able to call in 
the McKinnon team, you weren’t able to call in Babar Ahmad’s team.’

But Lord Justice Scott Baker said he had received written evidence from 
Mr McKinnon’s lawyers.

‘Janis McKinnon sent reams of material in, and 
the suggestion that we don’t understand the plight of persons sought to 
be extradited is, I’m afraid, not accepted,’ he added.

'He definitely should have heard from us and I would have told him how completely unfair and unequal the Extradition Treaty is'

He said the review did not look at individual cases, but extradition in 
general, adding: ‘They were all invited to give evidence in writing and 
many did. If there were issues we wanted to explore further and we 
thought we could get assistance, we did.’

Mr Vaz said it must have been a ‘disappointment’ that senior Coalition 
politicians had rejected his findings after Deputy Prime Minister Nick 
Clegg responded to the report by commissioning his own and Attorney 
General Dominic Grieve said the recommendations were just ‘guidelines’.  

However, Lord Justice Scott Baker said: ‘I don’t have any 
disappointment. I simply produced a report and it’s up to the 
politicians to do what they want with it. We think our recommendations 
are right.’

Last night Mr McKinnon’s mother Janis Sharp said: ‘He definitely should have heard from us.

‘I would have told him how completely unfair and unequal the treaty is, 
how this has totally destroyed Gary, totally destroyed our family.

‘But I think it would have fallen on deaf ears. Scott Baker’s report was
a whitewash and I think he was completely blinkered. Why should we need
the Americans’ input?

‘It’s ludicrous that he even went to Washington to speak to their 
officials because they have already made up their minds about Gary.’
