A grammar school has become only the second in Britain to be put into special measures by education inspectors despite achieving good GCSE results.

Chatham Grammar School for Boys in Kent was declared inadequate after a visit by Ofsted in June.

Inspectors criticised ‘weak and inadequate’ teaching and said pupils were not making the progress they were capable of despite above average results.

'Inadequate': Chatham Grammar School for boys has been placed in special measures following an Ofsted inspection

Students were well behaved as they moved around the school but this was ‘not always carried through to lessons’ where their attitudes to learning were directly linked to the quality of teaching.

Behaviour in lessons had ‘declined’, with students losing ‘interest and motivation’ when teaching was not good enough.

Students in all year groups, including the sixth form, reported low-level disruption in lessons that was hindering learning.

Another area of concern was ‘inconsistent and irregular’ marking, with teachers assessing work ‘infrequently’.

Some ‘focused on correcting presentation rather than specific advice on how to improve students’ knowledge and understanding of the subject’.

The report said: ‘The quality of 
learning and the quality of feedback students receive depends too much 
on the individual qualities of the teacher.

‘Some
students perceive that they are "lucky" if the teaching they receive is
good or outstanding and they would like their work to be marked by some
teachers more frequently.’

Recovery: Stretford Grammar School in Greater Manchester became the first grammar to be placed in special measures in 2009 but it emerged a year later

The school’s executive principal Denise Shepherd said yesterday: ‘We have to accept the findings of the Ofsted report. Our job is not to criticise and unpick.’

Head teacher David Marshall retired suddenly at the end of August after fighting the findings, according to Kent Online.

Commenting on whether he was forced out, Mrs Shepherd said: 'I think Mr Marshall has clearly made a decision himself and I really wasn't privy to those discussions at the time or since.'

Chatham Grammar pupils achieved a 95 per cent A* to C pass rate in their GCSEs last summer - down from 100 per cent the year before.

The only other grammar school in Britain to be placed in special measures was Stretford Grammar in Manchester in 2009. It re-emerged from special measures in 2010.
