Justice: Laure Hatfield, 50, was sentenced to three to six years in prison for causing a high-speed crash in 2010 that resulted in the death of her three grandchildren

A Pennsylvania grandmother has been ordered to spend three to six years in prison for a high-speed crash that killed her three young grandchildren in 2010.

Before Laurie Hatfield, 50, was sentenced to jail Wednesday, her son and the father of the three young victims, Luke Stump, made a tearful plea to the judge to keep his ailing mother out of jail during the emotional hearing. 

‘First
off, I want to say, mom, I love you. I know the kids loved you. ... I 
forgive you,' Stump said, adding that her incarceration is not 
going to bring him closure.

The deaths of his children has changed his life dramatically for the worse, he said.

'Nothing makes me happy,' he went on. 'And you know going to jail isn't going to change that.'

Stump appealed to the judge, asking him not to lock his mother away. 

'I'm not saying that what she did wasn't wrong...What I'm saying is what closure would I get putting her in prison?' Stump said. 

Hatfield had sought house arrest after pleading no contest to vehicular homicide in the crash that happened after state police say she sped away from another collision at about 100 mph with her three grandchildren in the vehicle.

Investigators say five-year-old Luke Stump Jr. and two-year-old twins Megyn and Troy Stump weren’t properly restrained when Hatfield’s speeding station wagon plunged down an embankment near Harrisburg in April 2010.

When given a chance to speak during 
her sentencing on Wednesday, Hatfield was so overcome with emotion that 
her words were mostly incomprehensible.

'I never, ever wanted this to happen and I wish to God it was me [who died],' Hatfield said through loud sobs.

The Patriot-News of Harrisburg reports that the courtroom descended into chaos when Hatfield's relatives realized that she was headed to jail.

The
outcry prompted deputies to remove Hatfield’s out-of-control family from the courtroom when Judge Bernard Coates Jr. announced the sentence.

Some of the outraged family members, which included eight of Hatfield's 10 children who turned out to support her, shouted and hurled insults as they made their exit and continued raging in the hallway.

Prosecutor
Fran Chardo later said that three of Hatfield's relatives were charged 
with disorderly conduct over the courtroom outburst.

Fatal mistake: Hatfield said she thought the children were properly restrained inside the station wagon before the accident

The case that ended on Wednesday with Hatfield's sentencing started in April 2010 when she drove her station wagon at 105mph through a guardrail and down and embankment off Route 22/322 in Middle Paxton Township.

The 50-year-old woman pleaded no contest in July to three counts of vehicular homicide along with a slew of other charges, including child endangerment and reckless endangerment.

Hatfield' attorney said that mother of 10, who is battling cancer, thought the children were properly buckled up in the car before the crash.

The lawyer, Paul Kovatch, added that his client is filled with remorse for what had happened and spends her days crying for her dead grandchildren.

The prosecution did not request a specific sentence for Hatfield. Judge Coates said he decided on the punishment with the three children in mind.

‘My last thoughts come to those kids,’ he said. ‘I shudder to imagine the horrific last minutes of their lives.’
