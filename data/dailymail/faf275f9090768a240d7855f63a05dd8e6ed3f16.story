Miami slugger Giancarlo Stanton has taken to Instagram to show fans how far he has come since being hit in the face by a fastball during a game last week.

Stanton had doctors appointments scheduled for today after which the team will have a better idea as to whether the Marlins have any hope him returning to the team before the season ends.

There will be an official statement on Wednesday, but it's doubtful he will be able to get back onto the field as he recovers from a gruesome injury.

Healing well: Giancarlo Stanton was hit under the left eye by a fastball last Thursday night. He says he is making good progress and recovering well. The hole at the corner of his mouth has now been patched up

Stanton was hit in the face by an 88 mph pitch from Milwaukee Brewers starter Mike Fiers on Thursday night and sustained facial fractures and dental damage.

'He's feeling much better, and you can tell in just a short amount of time you can tell how much better everything looks, the swelling has gone down,' Marlins manager Mike Redmond said to MLB.com. 

'That's why he's going through the evaluations and the tests to see where he's at.' 

'I would want nothing more than to have him step into that box before the season's over, just for him to have that comfort level of knowing that he got back into that box and didn't have for his last memory of the 2014 season of being get hit in the mouth,' Redmond said.

'But we're not sure that's a reality.'

Nasty hit: Miami Marlins' Giancarlo Stanton falls down after being hit in the face with a pitch during the fifth inning of a baseball game against the Milwaukee Brewers Thursday

Stanton's father was at the game and came on the field while his son was treated, and left with him in the ambulance.

It was ruled that Stanton swung trying to get out of the way of the 88 mph pitch from Fiers. Reed Johnson batted for Stanton and was hit in the hand by Fiers' next pitch, triggering a bench-clearing brawl.

Stanton immediately fell to the ground after being hit, and trainers from both teams rushed to help him. He was placed on a backboard and then a stretcher.

The All-Star outfielder tops the NL with 37 home runs and has 105 RBIs, and is batting .288. Miami has 17 games left this year.
