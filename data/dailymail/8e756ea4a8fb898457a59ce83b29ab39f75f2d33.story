Photos of the Duchess of Cambridge topless and Prince Harry naked would still have been circulated even if strict Press restrictions were in place, said former BBC chairman Michael Grade.

Lord Grade, who has also chaired ITV, said the Leveson Inquiry should carefully consider any measures to gag the Press, because ‘unethically obtained’ images could be seen on the internet regardless.

Lord Justice Leveson is due to present his report into Press standards next month, after a long inquiry sparked by the phone-hacking scandal.

Lord Grade, a member of the Press Complaints Commission, raised the issue of ‘the problem of content regulation in a global digital market’ during a parliamentary debate.

He said it was ‘hard to imagine’ a more difficult task than the one Lord Justice Leveson is undertaking, but hoped the end result would be a ‘new, enhanced, self-regulatory body’ codified in law for the first time.

Lord Grade said: ‘We have just had two Press controversies involving unethically obtained photographs of members of our Royal Family – Prince Harry in Las Vegas and the Duchess of Cambridge in France – which have vividly highlighted the problem of content regulation in a global digital media market.

‘I doubt it has escaped Lord Justice Leveson’s attention that the photographs of the Duchess were published in countries with regulatory regimes offered as possible solutions for the UK. On this evidence, his menu of available options seems to be shrinking.’

He said pictures of the Duchess were first published in France, ‘the country cited as having the model of strict privacy legislation’, but the rules were ‘ignored’ by an editor who could offset any court penalty with increased circulation revenues.

The photographs were then published in Ireland, which Lord Grade said had a system regarded as the possible model for the UK.

French magazine Closer first published pictures of the Duchess topless, followed by a number of publications

Sweden and Denmark, which each have the ability to impose stronger punishments on the Press than in Britain, also published the pictures.

Lord Grade defended the much-criticised PCC and proposed the creation of a new independent, transparent body with the ‘mandate, resources and powers of investigation to examine systemic issues as they arise’.

Those close to David Cameron, who will receive Lord Justice Leveson’s report next month, have suggested he is wary of imposing legislation restricting Press freedoms.
