A big service is one of the hallmarks of his game – now Andy Murray is taking a similar approach to his wedding.

The tennis star and fiancée Kim Sears will tie the knot at Dunblane Cathedral and not, as anticipated, in the tiny chapel at his Cromlix House Hotel, near the Perthshire town where he grew up.

For the 27-year-old’s many fans and friends in the town, it means at least part of the wedding of the year will be a spectator sport, played out on the streets of the community.

For many, the decision to hold the service in the cathedral will have added poignancy.

Happy couple: Andy Murray and Kim Sears will tie the knot at Dunblane cathedral rather than the small chapel at Cromlix

It was there that funerals and memorial services were held for some of the victims of the 1996 massacre, in which Thomas Hamilton murdered 16 children and their teacher in Dunblane Primary School.

Now Dunblane’s most famous son will marry there – 19 years after he hid under the headteacher’s desk until the shooting stopped.

It is understood local residents and businesses urged the former Wimbledon champion to hold the April 11 service at the cathedral rather than at Cromlix House in nearby Kinbuck – so they too could toast his big day. 

The 300-seat, 12th century cathedral is much bigger than the chapel at Cromlix, which seats only 28. Thousands are expected to line Dunblane High Street on the day. 

Murray’s uncle Niall Erskine said: ‘I’m sure it will be a popular decision, as he’s had so much support from the people of Dunblane in the past.

‘Andy is looking forward to bringing all his family and friends to Dunblane. I’m sure lots of people will come down to see the cars as they go past and it will be a very popular day.’

The cathedral’s minister, the Rev Colin Renwick, said: ‘I can’t confirm anything as we have a strict rule that we cannot discuss anyone’s wedding.

‘Wherever the wedding will be, there is excitement because there is a great deal of affection for Andy in Dunblane and a great deal of pride in him. I think people are genuinely very pleased for him.’

The couple announced their engagement in November after nine years together. 

They had been expected to wed at the 15-bedroom Cromlix House, which he bought for £1.8million in 2013. 

But it will still host family and friends before and after the service.

Murray’s schoolfriend Stewart McClymont, 28, said: ‘It’s great. There will be loads of people in the streets. It will be like a Scottish version of the royal wedding.

‘I’m sure Andy’s delighted that the people who want to share in his day will all be there to celebrate. Andy’s a great ambassador and everybody is fully behind him in his sporting and private life.

‘People would love to get a glimpse of Andy and Kim on their special day.’

Local businesses were also delighted. Staff at Bennett’s Butcher, famous for its Murray tribute products, predicted a bumper weekend.

Stuart Gavin said: ‘Everyone is excited just to see Andy get married, so for it to take place at the cathedral is even more special.

‘It will give the whole town a boost. I’ve a funny feeling Dunblane will be buzzing. We will definitely do something special to mark the occasion.’

Pauline Casey of gift shop Charisma said: ‘Everyone in the High Street will be delighted.’

Murray has said he may have three best men; his brother Jamie and friends Ross Hutchins and Carlos Mier.

It is believed Miss Sears will have four bridesmaids.
