The father of one of the three alleged Russian spies in America was a high ranking FSB intelligence service officer, it emerged today.

Igor Sporyshev, 40, is one of two 'espionage ring' members who left America under diplomatic cover.

He was a handler of Evgeny Buryakov, 39, who is now detained in New York on suspicion of being part of an intelligence gathering that sought to recruit spies - including female college students - in the US, according to federal prosecutors.

Meanwhile it has been revealed the third alleged spy, Victor Podobnyy, who has also left America, was recorded complaining his role was a far cry from the James Bond lifestyle he had imagined.

Arrested: Evgeny Buryakov, 39, appeared in federal court in New York yesterday after the alleged spy ring was busted. His two co-accused left America under diplomatic cover but Buryakov was not a diplomat

The men, including Igor Sporyshev, allegedly conspired to gather economic intelligence on behalf of Russia, including alleged information about U.S. sanctions against the country, and to recruit New York City residents as intelligence sources, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder (pictured in a file photo) said in a statement

The three were all charged on Monday with conspiring to gather economic intelligence on behalf of Russia, including alleged information about U.S. sanctions against the country, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement.

Sporyshev was bugged by the FBI and overheard saying that to recruit women 'you either need to f*** them or use other levers to influence them'.

In Moscow today it emerged that Sporyshev's father Mikhail, killed in a car crash in 2008, held the rank of Major-General in the FSB secret service, once headed by Vladimir Putin.

Sporyshev senior, who died aged 57, worked in the border guard section of the vast Federal Security Service (FSB) structure.

It is not uncommon for Russian espionage services to recruit the children of trusted officers.

Sporyshev junior and  Podobnyy, 27, have gone to ground since the allegations were revealed on Monday.

Evgeny Buryakov, 39, masked this work by posing as a banker for Russia's Vnesheconombank, (pictured) according to the complaint and the bank's website

Podobnyy was also caught on tape by the FBI, complaining about the wide gulf between Hollywood's glamorous version of being a spy, and the reality.

'The fact that I'm sitting with a cookie right now at the …chief enemy spot. F***! ,' he allegedly said in Russian, the New York Post reported.

'Not one point of what I thought then, (unintelligible) not even close. (Unintelligible) movies about James Bond. 

'Of course I wouldn't fly helicopters, but pretend to be someone else at a minimum.'

Both left the US before charges were filed, it is reported.

Russia broke its silence over the charges on Tuesday afternoon, when the foreign ministry dismissed the claims, saying the U.S. had failed to provide any evidence.

In a statement demanding Buryakov's release, spokesman Alexander Lukashevich said: 'One gets the impression that the U.S. government has decided to use a favored practice of unleashing passions over espionage.'

He added: 'Russian-American ties are going through an extremely complicated period due to Washington's hostilities.'

Relations between the two countries are at their worst for some time, with Washington imposing several rounds of sanctions on Russia for annexing the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 and backing pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine, targeting Russian financial and energy companies.

The FBI Twitter account carried the news on its page on Monday afternoon, announcing they had arrested Buryakov. The other two men had already left the country 

State-run news agency Sputnik expressed surprise that evidence against the trio included a phone call by Sporyshev to Buryakov - who is claimed to have worked as a banker to cover his intelligence role - asking for help formulating questions to be asked by an unnamed Russian news agency.

Embarrassingly for Moscow, Sporyshev was evidently caught in a bugged phone call talking to his fellow spy on the use of college women as potential spy recruits.

'I have lots of ideas about such girls,' Sporyshev is alleged to have told Podobnyy.

'But these ideas are not actionable because they don't allow you to get close enough. And in order to be close you either need to f*** them or use other levers to influence them.

'So when you tell me about girls, in my experience, it's very rare that something workable will come of it.'

Buryakov, who is understood to have worked in Russian Vnesheconombank's Manhattan office, was placed under arrest on Monday.

Married, he resided in New York but is believed to have come from Moscow.

Wall Street analysts have speculated his focus high-speed Wall Street trading, automated trading algorithms, and 'destabilisation of markets' may have meant he was learning how to trigger a Wall Street meltdown, the Telegraph reported. 

Igor Sporyshev was officially a Russian trade representative.

Undercover: Anna Chapman was one of a large Russian spy ring arrested in New York and New Jersey in 2010 

Infiltrated: Anna Chapman and her fellow spies lived apparently normal American lives. She refused to comment today on the arrest of an alleged member of a new spy ring

Podobnyy was listed in the US as an attache at the Russian mission to the United Nations.

Sporyshev and Podobnyy were also charged but will not face justice because unlike Buryakov they were covered by diplomatic immunity.

The spy ring is not the first of its kind. In June 2010, Anna Chapman was one of ten Russians arrested in New York and New Jersey after they were identified as being FSB 'sleeper' agents.

The group had lived apparently normal American lives, with some of them assuming stolen identities to pass themselves off as American citizens.

Chapman had gained her surname by marrying a British man when she lived in London, and lived near Wall Street where she dated a restaurant owner.

The agents were supposed to report back on US foreign policy, including towards Russia, and military policy. The arests ended in a prisoner exchange.

Today Chapmaned claim it was 'unethical' to comment on the arrest of a suspected Moscow spy in New York.

The glamorous undercover operative was herself detained by the FBI in the same city in 2010 before being exchanged in the Cold War-style swap.

On the latest spy scandal, she said: 'I have never commented on it. I have never done it in my entire life It is not customary and unethical.'

She is now a TV presenter and fashion commentator in Moscow.
