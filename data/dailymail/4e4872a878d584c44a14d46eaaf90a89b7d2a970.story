Shocking: Matthew Warren, 27, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound on April 5

Pastor Rick Warren gave his first sermon since his son killed himself in April.

Matthew Warren, 27 shot himself after struggling with mental illness.

The pastor and his wife Kay returned to their 20,000 strong congregation at Saddleback Church, California, on Saturday.

Thousands showed up for the sermon, with two overflow tents being filled, reported Time.

The crowd stood and applauded the couple as they walked hand in hand onstage.

Pastor Warren kissed his crying wife as he too became teary, before telling the congregation that he loved them.

He said: ‘For 27 years, I prayed every day of my life for God to heal my son’s mental illness. It was the number one prayer of my life. It just didn’t make sense why this prayer was not being answered.’

For the first time the couple described how they discovered their son was dead.

On April 5 Pastor and Warren was diagnosed with double pneumonia and asked his brother to give his sermon entitled ‘What to do on the worst day of your life.’

The couple said that neither of them could shake the feeling that something was wrong with their son so they went to his house.

Upon arrival they could see that his truck was there, but there was no answer.

When the police arrived their fears were confirmed.

The pastor said that he and his wife had drawn on old Bible passages from the prophet Isaiah for strength.

Support: This was the first time Pastor Warren and his wife Kay had been onstage at their church since April

He added that his friends and family had supported him: ‘I am in this family of spiritual redwoods. Satan picked the wrong team to pick on.’

Pastor Warren said that his parish will now campaign to remove the stigma of mental illness in the church.

He said: ‘Your illness is not your identity, your chemistry is not your character. We are here for you, and we are in this together.’

He has written a sermon series named ‘How to get through what you’re going through’, and will deliver it over the next six weeks.

Each week focusses on a different stage of grief: shock, sorrow, struggle, surrender, sanctification and service.

It was revealed shortly after his death that Matthew Warren killed himself with an unregistered gun purchased over the internet.

Pastor Warren said he forgives whoever sold the weapon.

Orange County Sheriff's spokesman Jim Amormino said that the gun's serial number was scratched off.

It's illegal in California to buy a gun without a background check and purchasers are supposed to register their firearms. Defacing a gun's serial number is a federal offense.

‘Someone on the internet sold Matthew an unregistered gun. I pray he seeks God's forgiveness. I forgive him. #MATTHEW 6:15,' the pastor tweeted, referencing a Biblical passage about the forgiveness of sins.

‘If you forgive men when they sin against you, your Heavenly Father will forgive you. But if you don't...,’ Warren then tweeted, quoting the verse.

The Christian community was shaken after Matthew died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound on April 5 in Mission Viejo, Calif., after a long battle with mental illness.

Rick Warren's revelation about the weapon comes as Congress debates controversial gun-control legislation, including expanded background checks on gun sales.

After the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in December, he spoke to Fox News about his views on what he called America's 'culture of violence.'

‘There's a mental health angle that you have to deal with; I don't think we're taking care of those struggling with mental illness like we need to in America,’ he said. 

The news came as a shock to the Evangelical community, where Rick and his wife, Kay, are major celebrities after the release of the Purpose Driven Life in 2002.

Congregation: Kay and Rick Warren founded the church in 1980 and it has grown into a megachurch, with an average weekly attendance of 20,000

The devotional book became a New York Times bestseller and has sold over 32 million copies worldwide.

The Warrens also have two older children, Amy and Josh.

Though the couple has been vocal about their marital struggles and Kay Warren has written about being a victim of sexual-abuse as a child, the couple had not disclosed their son's condition.

The family has established a fund in Matthew's memory and are raising money to help others impacted by mental illness.

Rick Warren started his church in 1980 and it has grown to become one of the largest evangelical churches in the U.S. with an average attendance of 20,000.
