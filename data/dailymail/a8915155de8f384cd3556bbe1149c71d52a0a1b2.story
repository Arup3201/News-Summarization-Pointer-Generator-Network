A second iPhone 4 has exploded without warning just days after another device blew up on a flight sparking fears over the safety of the phone.

Reports from Brazil say that the iPhone 4 was plugged in to charge overnight when it began to emit smoke and sparks as its owner slept nearby.

This is the second high-profile explosion of an iPhone in a week, in the first incident the handheld device spontaneously combusted during landing on a flight in Australia two days ago.

Tech and mobile website Mashable, which reported the incident, said: 'Looks like Australia isn’t the only country to have seen an incident of a combustible iPhone 4 over the past week.

'According to Brazilian media reports, the iPhone’s owner emerged unscathed but flustered.'

In the first incident, an Apple iPhone began ‘emitting a significant amount of dense smoke, 
accompanied by a red glow’, said Australia's Regional Express airline.

The fire was put out by a flight 
attendant and the device, thought to be an iPhone 4, given to air traffic
safety investigators for checks. No passengers or crew were harmed.

A picture released by the airline, Australia’s largest independent regional carrier, shows the 
rear casing shattered in parts and scorched in others.

Apple Australia says it is ‘looking forward to working with officials’.

The cause has yet to be identified 
but experts say that it may be due to the phone’s battery overheating or
to the device being a counterfeit model.

Earlier this month, Apple recalled 
first generation iPod Nano MP3 players over concerns about defective
batteries overheating. However, these devices were made in 2005 and 
2006 and so are much older than the exploding iPhone mobiles.

The drama began when the crew smelt 
smoke in the cabin as a flight from Lismore in New South Wales landed in
Sydney on Friday evening.

In a statement headed ‘mobile phone 
self-combustion’, Regional Express said: ‘In accordance with company 
standard safety procedures, the flight attendant carried out recovery 
action immediately and the red glow was extinguished successfully.

‘All passengers and crew onboard were unharmed.’

It added that it has reported the 
incident to the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) and the Civil 
Aviation Safety Authority (CASA).

The ATSB, which has listed the 
incident as involving ‘smokes, fumes and fire’ will strip down the phone
to ‘try and understand what happened’.

A CASA spokesman said that he had never heard of a similar incident occurring during or after a flight.

Mobile phone experts said it is possible the fire was caused by the phone’s battery overheating.

Rechargeable lithium ion batteries 
are widely used in mobile phones and laptops and, when shipped in large 
numbers, have been linked to fires on planes in the past.

Last year, the Federal Aviation 
Administration in the U.S. issued a safety alert after a cargo plane 
carrying a large shipment of the batteries went on fire and crashed near
Dubai, killing both pilots.

It read: ‘Overheating has the 
potential to create thermal runaway, a chain reaction leading to 
self-heating and release of a battery’s stored energy.

‘In a fire situation, the air temperature in a cargo compartment fire may be above the auto-ignition temperature of lithium.

‘For this reason, batteries that are 
not involved in an initial fire may ignite and propagate, thus creating a
risk of a catastrophic event.

‘The existence and magnitude of the 
risk will depend on such factors as the total number and type of 
batteries on board an aircraft, the batteries’ proximity to one another,
and existing risk mitigation measures in place.’

There are also suggestions that the phone – or battery – may have been fake.

Rob Temple, of Technology magazine 
T3, said: ‘This is a very rare thing and so it makes you suspect it 
might be a counterfeit battery.

‘When you think about the number of people who have iPhones and other smartphones, it doesn’t really happen.’

Chris Althaus, of the Australian 
Mobile Telecommunications Association, told ABC News: ‘We urge people to
be very careful if they are buying batteries that they buy them from a 
reputable dealer, look for products that are identified by the 
manufacturer of your phone as compatible and be very aware of cheap 
imitations.’

Many iPhone 4 users have already complained that their battery drains faster than expected.
