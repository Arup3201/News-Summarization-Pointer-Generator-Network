A news anchor who lost her hair to aggressive breast cancer treatment took the brave decision to remove her wig live on-air.

Pam McKelvy, 45, from the Tennessee-based station WMC-TV, told viewers last Wednesday before revealing the newly-grown curls hiding under her faux brunette bob: 'A woman’s relationship with her hair is sacred, her hair is her crown of glory. And for women in TV it’s intensified.

'I lost my hair after chemo and I’ve been wearing a wig since this past March. Today I’m taking it off for good. This is a milestone, blessed experience for me.'

After a brief pre-filmed segment, the studio cameras panned back to Ms McKelvy showing her in her natural state.

'You are just so very beautiful and your hair looks good,' one of her co-hosts remarked in support.

‘No more relaxers to straighten my hair,’ she exclaimed.

'I want everybody to know that no matter what you go through, it’s not about what’s on the outside, it’s about what’s on the inside.

'And I feel that on the inside I am more radiant and beautiful than I’ve ever been.'

One video of Ms McKelvy removing her wig has been watched more than 10,000 times on YouTube.

Many commenters have praised the broadcaster for her bravery.

One viewer wrote: 'You are beautiful on the outside. Continue to wear your crown of glory and watch it flourish.'

On Wednesday's show she thanked her co-workers for their supportive during everything she's been through

And another added: '﻿I love this video. Inspirational to all.'

Ms McKelvy is said to be recovering well after undergoing breast cancer treatment.

Concluding, she said: 'I feel good, healthier, I'm grateful to be here.

'It is a wonderful thing to be sitting here and sharing this experience.'

The Detroit native only recently returned to television screens after taking seven years off to look after her autistic son, Ian.

On Wednesday's show she thanked her co-workers for their unwavering support during everything she's been through.
