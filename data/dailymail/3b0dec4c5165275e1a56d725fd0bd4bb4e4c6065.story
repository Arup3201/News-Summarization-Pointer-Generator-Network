A Moroccan man who was plotting to fly bomb-laden toy planes into a school and a government building in Connecticut has been arrested.

El Mehdi Semlali Fahti was planning on stuffing radio-controlled toy planes with explosives and flying them into different buildings in a now-thwarted terror plot.

He was caught by an undercover FBI agent who had five recorded conversations with Fahti wherein the 27-year-old Moroccan explained how he researched his plan for months. He is now being held without bail at Wyatt Detention Center in Rhode Island.

Dangerous plot: A man was arrested for plotting to fill up a radio-controlled toy plane like this one and then ram it into certain targets in order to wreck havoc and kill Americans

He did not specify the exact targets, but stated that he would fly at least one of the planes into a federal building in Connecticut and then fly another into an undisclosed school out of the state.

Fahti has been charged with making false statements, falsely swearing under oath and falsifying immigration documents.

He does not face any terrorism-specific charges yet but The Connecticut Post reports that Assistant U.S. Attorney Krishna Patel is taking the evidence to a federal grand jury which could lead to an indictment. 

The charge relating to his immigration documentation comes because he stayed in the United States for seven years after his student visa expired.

He was originally allowed into the country to attend Virginia International University but he failed out of the school and never left.

Possible target? The would-be terrorist did not name the exact spots that he planned to attack but said that it would be a federal building in Connecticut, which could include the statehouse (pictured), and a school out of the state

He was arrested twice- once in Virginia for trespassing, but those charges were dropped, and another time in California for an unspecified theft.

Fahti spent time in jail in connection to that theft charge and was threatened with deportation but that is when he concocted a string of lies that helped him stay in the country.

During his conversations with an undercover agent, the 27-year-old told how he researched issues in Morocco that would qualify him for refugee status and then used them to make his case to an immigration judge.

He said that he was a part of the Jamaat Ansar El-Mehdi  and Western Sahara freedom movements, and claimed to have been beaten and jailed by Moroccan police as a result.

'Everything he wrote in his refugee application coincided with the actual events,' FBI Special Agent Anabela Sharp wrote in the affadavit, according to The Connecticut Post.

He moved to Bridgeport, Connecticut in January and had been living with a man that he met while in jail in Virginia.

Police arrested him at the apartment, and found wires that they believe may be connected to the bomb plot but had not released any information about possible explosives at the residence.
