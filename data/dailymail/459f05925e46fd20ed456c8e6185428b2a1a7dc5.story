Apple, Starbucks and Fiat are being investigated by Brussels over claims they received ‘sweetheart’ deals to cut their tax bills.

The European Commission is concerned that authorities in Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg gave the companies preferential treatment in breach of EU rules.

If they are found to have avoided tax, the three multi-national giants could face huge bills covering the past ten years.

Last night, experts said the multi-national giants could be hit with ‘horrendous’ bills.

Joaquin Almunia, the EC vice president in charge of competition policy said: ‘In the current context of tight public budgets, it is particularly important that large multinationals pay their fair share of taxes.’

Algirdas Semeta, commissioner for taxation added that ‘fair tax competition is essential for the integrity of the single market.’

The probe marks an escalation of attempts to stamp out tax avoidance by big companies, which has risen up the political agenda in recent years.

Apple and Starbucks are among a number of US giants accused of avoiding tax for years through elaborate networks of subsidiaries. 

Other big names in the spotlight include Google and Amazon.

The EC’s intervention comes after a US senate probe last year revealed Apple had sheltered billions of dollars in profits from tax by using ‘ghost companies’ registered in Cork which  were not resident in  any country for tax purposes.

This has allowed it to pay no corporation tax on international sales, including in the UK.

By channelling sales through Irish companies the Senate Committee found the California based company paid no corporation tax to any country on £18bn in profits made outside the US between 2009 and 2012.

Starbucks has also found itself at the centre of a political storm after it emerged it had only paid corporate tax in the UK once in 15 years of trading, despite racking up more than £3billion of sales.

Starbucks told a UK parliamentary investigation in 2012 that it received a tax deal in the Netherlands which allowed it to enjoy a ‘very low’ tax rate.

It caved in to public pressure in December 2012 and agreed to pay £20m of corporation tax over two years to the UK government whether or not it reports a profit.

Richard Murphy, of Tax Research UK said: ‘These companies are guilty of blatant tax avoidance that undermines their local competition. They could be hit with horrendous fines.

‘Hopefully this will help create a level level playing field on tax which would be good news for every honest business based in the UK.’

But an Apple spokesman said: ‘We have received no selective treatment from Irish officials. Apple is subject to the same tax laws as scores of other international companies doing business in Ireland.’

A Starbucks spokesman said: ‘We comply with all relevant tax rules, laws, and OECD guidelines and we’re studying the Commission’s announcement related to the state aid investigation in the Netherlands.’

Last night they received the backing of business leaders in the UK, with influential lobby group the Institute of Directors accusing the EC of using its state aid rules as a ‘political weapon’ to increase its influence on the tax affairs of EU members.

Allie Renison, trade and Europe policy adviser, said: ‘There is a risk here that the Commission is trying to be seen to be doing something about corporate tax compliance by inserting itself into the sovereign tax affairs of individual member states under the cover of concern about state aid infringement.’

She added: “There is a legitimate discussion to be had about tackling perceived tax avoidance, but conflating different debates is not the way to do it. The EU must not put politics ahead of economics.’
