Alastair Cook could scarcely believe his eyes as Marais Erasmus bizarrely hitched up his trousers before raising his finger and sending the England captain on his way. He had gone so far towards the Test century that would mean more to him than any of his other 25, but ultimately he had fallen just five runs short.

The South African umpire had quite rightly detected the thinnest of bottom edges through to MS Dhoni as Cook had shaped to pull the spin of Ravindra Jadeja and cut short the innings that had done so much to salvage his career.

It did not stop the Ageas Bowl crowd giving Cook a rousing reception in keeping with the support he has received throughout his struggles, but it was a cruel moment for a captain who had battled so hard to keep his reign afloat.

This was a performance made under 
extreme pressure from Cook, crafted from the depths of having virtually 
every former England captain who voices a public opinion calling for him
 to quit after the quite shocking second Test defeat.

If
 Lord’s felt like rock bottom for the ‘new’ England and their captain 
then the first day of the third Test was perhaps the start of the climb 
back up, with Cook showing he is not going to give up on his leadership 
without one hell of a fight.

A
 score of 247 for two, with Gary Ballance continuing the impressive 
start to his Test career with another hundred, is not exactly a cause to
 crack open the champagne but, for an England side in desperate need of a
 boost, it is a start.

At 
the centre of it was Cook who, after a run of 27 innings without a 
hundred and growing concerns about his captaincy ability, surely could 
not have survived another failure here whatever the rest of this Test 
has in store for his team.

Cook
 could have taken the easy way out after winning the toss on another 
greenish pitch and bowled first, particularly with a four-man seam 
attack freshened by the inclusion of Chris Jordan and Chris Woakes at 
his disposal.

Yet it was a 
measure of his mettle that he faced up to his moment of destiny and 
realised that if England could get through the first morning then there 
should be runs to be had on what looks an excellent Ageas Bowl surface.

He
 would have known that England’s supporters are still with him as a roar
 greeted his march to the crease with Sam Robson to face an India side 
without their Lord’s tormentor Ishant Sharma, who pulled out with an 
ankle injury.

Yet those 
calls for Cook’s head would reached a crescendo had he been caught by 
Jadeja, as he should have been, on 15. Luck, for once, was on his side 
and what followed was an innings similar to the century against Pakistan
 four years ago at the Oval that saved him at a similarly low ebb.

It
 was not exactly a flawless display, with Cook driving Mohammed Shami 
loosely through gully on 33 and then almost running himself out on 68, 
but it was full of the cussed character that lurks within such a 
mild-mannered exterior.

Alastair Cook overtook Kevin Pietersen and David Gower to become England’s third-highest Test run-scorer with his 95 on Sunday.

8 - Alastair Cook and Sam Robson finally recorded their first half-century partnership, after eight innings opening together

2,000 - Cook became the ninth player to score 2,000 Test runs as England captain. Mike Atherton has the most (3,815).

When
 he reached 22, Cook went past the Test run-tally of Kevin Pietersen, 
whose sacking after the Ashes horror show continues to cast such a giant
 shadow over England’s attempts to move on without him.

Then,
 when he had scored 70, Cook moved past David Gower to leave only Alec 
Stewart and Graham Gooch ahead of him, a measure of the player he has 
been for England and still, at 29, should be in the future. Maybe now he
 will have regained the confidence to believe that he is back on course 
to overtake Gooch and go on to become the first England batsman to score
 10,000 Test runs.

That 
elusive 26th Test century, one that has looked further and further away 
as failure has followed failure, looked assured on Sunday until, 
understandably, he displayed some nerves in the 90s and missed two 
golden opportunities on his favourite cut shot to hurry towards three 
figures.

Centurion: Gary Ballance was unbeaten on 104 as he continued his strong international start

Moment: England's No 3 punches the air after scoring his third century in six Tests

Cook was denied a century when he edged a ball from Ravindra Jadeja — a fact confirmed by Snicko, though he was dropped on 15.

Jadeja then ensured
 it was not to be but if Cook can get back to leading by example, as he 
did when England won in India, then perhaps everything else will fall 
into place. He will certainly take to the field when India bat in much 
more positive mind.

A big 
total to defend would help and Ballance, who is scoring prolifically for
 England without yet tasting victory, has taken them a long way towards 
the sort of score that would allow Cook and England to call the shots.

Ballance
 was tested to the full, with giant Indian debutant Pankaj Singh 
impressing in Ishant’s place, in a nervy passage after Robson had again 
played at a ball he could have left outside off-stump and fallen to 
Shami.

But clearly Ballance 
has the right temperament for Test cricket and came through to reach the
 century, his third in just six Tests along with two other half 
centuries, that Cook would dearly have loved to record.

Troubles: Sam Robson was caught by Ravindra Jadeja in the slips for 26 in the morning session

Ovation: England's under-pressure captain received a warm reception from the crowd

He
 too could have fell early and was grateful for another excellent 
umpiring decision, this time when Rod Tucker turned down appeals for a 
caught behind with Ballance on 10, but grew in assurance during a stand 
of 158 with Cook.

The one 
umpiring glitch came late on when Ian Bell was highly fortunate to 
escape being lbw before he had scored, but he survived until the close 
and has the chance to follow Cook’s example and fight his way out of 
trouble on Monday.

England’s
 scoring rate means they are not yet in command but they have the 
potential to be by close on day two and that position and his own 
contribution would have made Cook sleep more soundly.
