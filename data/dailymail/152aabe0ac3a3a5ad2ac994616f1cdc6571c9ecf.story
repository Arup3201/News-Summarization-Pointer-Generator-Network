If you're fed up of plodding around dry land on two feet, your human form need no longer constrain your enjoyment on earth. Now you can kick off your shoes, don a tail and become a mermaid at Europe's first mermaid academy.

Sirenas Mediterranean Academy in Tarragona, Spain, claims to be able to teach mere mortals how to transform into mythical beings by tackling such practical issues as swimming with a tail and holding one's breath underwater.

'We make dreams come true, 
regardless of age or gender,' says Alejandro Rodríguez Bosch, who co-owns the academy with Susana Seum Pascual. 'We offer our customers a unique experience in 
the Mediterranean Sea - to live their magical fantasy of becoming a mermaid or merman.'

Swimming with a tail makes large groups of muscles work together and is a great from of exercise, according to owner Alejandro Rodríguez Bosch

'Our wish is that the client feels like a character of history, by living the magical experience of being a mythological 
creature,' he adds.

It may sound like a good (and loopy) excuse for a photo opportunity but according to Alejandro there are serious reasons people should consider becoming a mermaid.

'Aquatic activity is one of the best ways to stay healthy and swimming with a tail makes large 
groups of muscles work together,' explains Alejandro. Given that a fat mermaid is a rare site indeed, perhaps there's something to it.

'Mermaid training also helps to improve a person’s mood,' he adds. 'And because it is not high impact and it can be practiced by anybody,
 regardless of age.'

'When the body moves in a wave 
motion, assisted by the propulsion of a fin, the gluteus, abdominal and lumbar muscles are all worked. The movements made with the arms also works the
triceps, pectorals and back.

'Breathing like a mermaid  facilitates the 
return of blood to the heart and the ventilation of the lung 
alveoli so the activity is a complete work of toning, strengthening and
 oxygenation,' he adds.

Family fun of the mythological variety, the mermaid academy caters for all ages

The academy offers two courses, the mermaid baptism level, which caters 
for mermaid beginners and takes place in a swimming pool, and the 
advanced level course, where mermaid apprentices are set free on the 
beach. The classes are priced at 39euros for 90 minutes for beginners and 49euros for 90 minutes for advanced.

The intensity of the training is dependent on the level of the client. And once apprentices are comfortable in their new bodies they can then hone their skills and learn underwater choreography.

'We have qualified instructors in the natural aquatic environment and unique and professional equipment,' says Alejandro. 'It's a great experience for those who love to be in the water, enjoy laughing, like to dream, and stay healthy.'
