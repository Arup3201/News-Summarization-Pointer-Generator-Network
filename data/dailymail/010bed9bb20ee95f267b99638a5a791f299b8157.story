The Edinburgh home where Harry Potter author JK Rowling lived while she wrote several of the chart-topping books is up for sale for offers over £2.25m.

The 47-year-old writer moved from the eight-bedroom Merchiston home to a house in Barnton in 2009.

But she had already written at least four of the seven books in the 19th century, ivy-clad building where she lived with her husband Dr Neil Murray and her three children.

House of inspiration: The Edinburgh house where Harry Potter author JK Rowling wrote at least four of the seven book has been sold for more than £2.25m

Scenic home: The house - which has been bought by a local Scottish businessman - was the author's home with her husband and children until she moved out in 2009

Scene of her writing: The view from the patio at the rear of the house looking out into the garden

Change of fortune: JK Rowling was a single mother living on benefits before her Harry Potter novels made her millions

In the prospectus estate agents Rettie who are selling the family home, describe the property as  being situated in 'one of Edinburgh's most exclusive conservation areas.'

Built on two floors, the stone building has landscaped gardens and several outhouses as well as a detached split-level office.

Although it is valued at a cool £2.5million, JK Rowling is worth around £560 million according to the 2012 Sunday Times Rich List.

Prospective buyers being shown around 
the home will be disappointed to learn the remnants of the famous author
will be not be spotted.

Since she moved out three years ago it has been refurbished and undergone a redesign to 'complement retained Victorian period features.'

It has been decorated with neutral colours, although the pink sofas in the living room show off a spark of flair.

The new owner will be able to enjoy 
off-street parking and a double garage which can be accessed from a 
cobbled lane at the rear of the house.

Space: the kitchen of the eight-bedroom Merchiston home boasts an abundance of space and natural daylight

Emptied out: The house has been completely refurbished since the author and her family moved out in 2009

The gardens are walled and the property comes with an advanced alarm security system - this is not 
surprising as the author has previously spoken in the past of how 
difficult she found the scrutiny of the press.

Last year she told the Leveson Inquiry into Press standards that she and her family were driven out of their home 
and deterred from taking family holidays because of the constant 
presence of photographers.

Home office: The house is situated in what the estate agent called 'one of Edinburgh's most exclusive conservation areas'

Period features: The house retains many period features including huge sash windows, shutters and cornicing

Period home: The 19th century building is made of stone and spans two floors

The author and her family now live in a different home that is worth £2million

Miss Rowling, 46, bought her current 
home, a 17th century mansion for more than £2 million in 2009 when she 
reportedly fell in love with it after viewing just two of its 31 rooms.

She lives there with her husband, their two young children and her 18-year-old daughter 
Jessica, from her first marriage.

The property has been dubbed ‘Fortress Rowling’ by some because of its security fences and reinforced doors.

Giant trees were lifted by crane over the garden walls to give the author and her family more privacy.

Secure: The house has an intercom for secure entry - JK Rowling has previously spoken of how difficult she found life with paparazzi outside her home

Last year JK Rowling got planning permission to flatten a £1 million 1970s style house next door to make her garden larger.

She also got approval to build a summer house that critics said looked like the stone hut inhabited by Hagrid, the giant groundsman from her best-selling novels.

In July JK Rowling's husband applied for planning permission for two huge interlocked treehouses at her new home in Barnton.

Portfolio: As well as landscaped gardens, the property comes with several outhouses

Spacious: There are three different exits from the grounds of the impressive house

But even by JK Rowling’s standards 
the 40ft high, two-storey tree houses planned for the back garden of her
mansion are something spectacular.

The Hogwarts-style towers - estimated to cost around £150,000 - are so big that they need planning permission.

Each wooden tree house is to be built
on stilts and boasts balconies, carvings and turrets that wouldn’t look
out of place in a Potter adventure.

The towers are linked by a rope bridge and can be approached by a secret tunnel hidden underneath a raised wooden walkway.

Place to work: The house also comes with an office building, which could be where JK Rowling penned her famous novels

Spacious: The office building is detached and is split-level, a world away from the cafe when the author penned her first book

Plans lodged with the City of 
Edinburgh Council reveal the houses are intended for Miss Rowling’s two 
youngest children David, nine, and his sister Mackenzie, seven.

Although she has completed the Harry 
Potter series, her first adult book, The Casual Vacancy, which is set in
a fictional English village, was published last week.

Wealthy: Daniel Radcliffe is pictured as Harry Potter. Creator JK Rowling is worth around £560 million according to the 2012 Sunday Times Rich List

Small change: The Rowling fortune is estimated to be at £560m so the price tag of the Scottish home is relatively small to the author

On a bigger scale: An outhouse in the grounds of the home - in her new house JK Rowling has commissioned a pair of £150,000 tree houses for her two youngest children
