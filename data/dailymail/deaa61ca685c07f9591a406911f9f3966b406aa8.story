A former host at a popular Christian radio station  has pleaded guilty in a child pornography investigation.

John Balyo told a federal judge last week that he photographed sex acts with a 12-year-old boy at a Kalamazoo County motel in April after paying him then handcuffing the child to a bed. 

He pleaded guilty to sexual exploitation and possessing child pornography. Balyo, of Battle Creek, Michigan, said he knew it was wrong.

Former Christian radio DJ John Balyo, 35, (pictured with an unidentified child), was charged with having sex with a minor. He pleaded guilty in court last week where he told the judge that he knew he was wrong 

The boy's family were in court for the plea hearing in Grand Rapids and wept as details of sexual assault were heard, Freep.com reported.  

Balyo told the court: 'I did take images of a child and they were sexually explicit involving bondage and nudity. I performed sex acts as described. I knew it was wrong.'

The 35-year-old was a host at Christian radio station WCSG in Grand Rapids until his arrest in June at a Christian music festival in northern Michigan. 

His arrest was related to state charges of criminal sexual conduct. Balyo faces a mandatory minimum of 15 years in federal prison, but he could be sentenced to the rest of his life behind bars. 

Balyo admitted in June that he had a rented storage unit where he kept a 'bondage kit' of handcuffs, chains and duct tape, a federal spokesman confirmed to MailOnline. 

It is claimed that Balyo paid a man to arrange a sex session with a minor for him.

He was arrested in June while at the Big Ticket Christian music festival in Gaylord, Michigan.

Handcuffs and other items were found in a suitcase after police searched a storage unit in Plainfield Township.

An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) spokesman told MailOnline in June that while being interviewed Balyo indicated that he had a storage unit and gave officers permission to search the space.

A padlock, rubber gloves and children's socks were also discovered, MLive reported.

Balyo also had piles of articles about missing children and children's obituaries, it was reported, along with an erotic photography magazine. 

The accused was denied bail after being charged with first- and second-degree criminal sexual conduct. He is now facing the rest of his life in prison.

Balyo is married and has a stepson, according to the Christian Post. Balyo got married in April, the same month that he committed the sex crime.

The DJ allegedly paid resident Ronald Moser, 41, to have sex with a young boy through a website he ran. Authorities who raided Moser's property on June 5 found him at a home with a boy.

Under his plea agreement, Balyo will testify against Moser. 

According to mlive.com, in a photo album allegedly posted online by Moser, there were ten images of a young boy lying face down on a bed.

His hands and feet were bound and he was wearing only underwear, which had been rolled up to show his buttocks, according to a federal agent.

The albums had titles such as 'very cute boy,' and 'sexy boys', police said.

The FBI said Moser put images online and planned to trade in child porn. It is alleged that Moser ran a website providing sex with underage boys for money.

The investigation into the alleged pedophiles has involved multiple agencies as part of a larger 'Operation Predator'.

Balyo was fired from his job at WCSG and the station publicly asked for prayers for the former host, his family and alleged victims.

The 35-year-old had been at the radio station for eight years.

In a statement at the time of Balyo's arrest, WCSG said: 'We sincerely grieve over these recent events, in particular the tragic impact on victims and their parents. The trafficking and exploitation of minors is absolutely deplorable.

'The WCSG family is deeply aching and know you may be hurting as well.'

A spokesman added: 'We know that no one, absolutely no one, is immune from falling into the darkness of sin. And yet, we have hope. Those who truly follow and live for Jesus Christ know He alone has the power to restore broken lives and broken trust.'

Balyo will be sentenced in November.
