Footballer Wayne Rooney is well-known for his fiery antics on and off the piich.

And it seems his newest racehorse, Announcement, has been taken one too many tips from its owner.

According to The Sun, Rooney has been forced to draft in help from an equine therapist to curb the filly's temper - after it broke a trainer's nose.

The 28-year-old striker employed Gary Witheford, an expert in dangerous and difficult horses, to try and calm the young racehorse down.

Mr Witheford, 54, from Burbage, Wiltshire, told the paper Rooney's newest horse had 'pyschological issues'.

He said: 'It would be an understatement to say she was highly strung. She has been really bad.

'Last week she even broke someone's nose.'

Rooney, who recently retired two other horses, bought the three-year-old racehorse last month.

He owns Announcement with his fellow Manchester United teammates Michael Carrick and Jonny Evans. Former teammate, and now Sunderland defender John O'Shea, also has a share.

But stablehands found the young horse too hard to handle. They battled to get her into the stalls and she refused to stand still long enough to be saddled, the paper reports.

Mr Witheford, who describes himself as having a 'unique insight into the psychology of the horse', used his own techniques to try and soothe the horse.

The therapist uses his own bespoke techniques to deal with horses who have behavioural issues.

Gary, 54, told the paper he was very pleased with the work he had done and said Announcement could be racing by mid-May.

But the horse's problems are the latest setback for Rooney in his bumpy racehorse-owning career.

Rooney and his wife Coleen's previous two horses, Pippy and Switcherooney, were retired in December after the pair managed just a single victory between them - a win by Pippy in August 2012 - in 23 starts.

It is not known how much Rooney paid for Announcement, but it is thought he invested £200,000 in his first few horses. He also had a third horse, Tomway, which he sold for £2,000.

A source also told The Sun that Gary's bill for days of therapy is likely to be more than £1,000.

But Announcement, who is being trained by Ian Williams, seems to be taking to the sport better than Rooney's other horses.

She has already equalled Rooney's racing record by 
winning only her second race at Thirsk, North Yorks.

The horse also 
finished fourth in her debut race at Kempton Park, Middlesex.

It is believed the Rooneys paid a total of £40,000 a year to the Manor House Stables in 
Cheshire for the horses to be trained and cared for.

It is thought ex-teammate Michael Owen got the pair into the sport through the stables that he co-owns in Malpas, Cheshire.

Owen founded Manor House Stables in 2007 and trainer Tom Dascombe joined two years later.

The stables reported winnings of close to £700,000 for 2013 with over 50 victories in less than 12 months.

Mr Dascombe also trains several horses owned by Michael Owen, under his company name Owen Promotions LTD.
