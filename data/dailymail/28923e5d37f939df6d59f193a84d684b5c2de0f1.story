Tottenham face three gruelling journeys to their Europa League group opponents after they were drawn against a trio of clubs from south-east Europe.

The draw also threw up a potential security threat in Istanbul and London, since Spurs face home and away games against Besiktas in the same weeks that their north London rivals Arsenal will take on Galatasaray in the Champions League. 

Celebrations: Tottenham will hope to get even further than the last 16 of the competitions this season

Galatasaray come to the Emirates on October 1, the night before Besiktas play at White Hart Lane, while Spurs and Arsenal fans will be in Istanbul for their respective games at Besiktas (Dec 11) and Galatasaray (Dec 9).
