It has to be the ultimate package holiday for ambitious parents – a luxury trip abroad, complete with exam revision courses for the kids.

For the first time, youngsters who once happily left their school books behind at the end of term are facing rigorous week-long courses – some complete with mock exams – during family holidays in top resorts.

In the fashionable French ski resort of Val d’Isere, up to 100 GCSE and A-level students will face special Ski And Revise classes for the first time this Easter, costing parents an extra £850 a week per pupil.

Sir Anthony Seldon, headmaster of independent school Wellington College in Berkshire criticised the holiday programs saying children would ‘get better results in their exams if they have had a good holiday'

And, elsewhere in the Alps, one high-end ski operator now offers ‘tailored tuition in the comfort of your own chalet’ as an addition to their regular ski packages.

Now, other leading holiday companies are considering offering tutoring as part of their tours.

But the holiday tutorials are proving controversial among educationalists, with one leading headmaster branding them ‘a waste of money’. Under the scheme in Val d’Isere – a celebrity haunt favoured by Prince Harry and Jamie Oliver – ten experienced tutors will lead 25 hours of formal revision classes over a week in a conference centre in the heart of the resort, booked through London-based company Tutor House.

Hot-housed students will start three hours of classes at eight in the morning already dressed for skiing, and local ski schools will delay lessons so they do not miss time on the slopes.

After six hours’ skiing, pupils will return to academic matters at 5pm for another two hours of revision.

The courses, which will be offered for three weeks over Easter, will culminate with mock exams, followed by a feedback session with parents to assess pupils’ progress. The courses will add £850 per student to the cost of skiing at the famous resort, which can set back a family of four by as much as £8,000 a week.

Parents also have the option of signing their offspring up for a single day’s tutorials at £200 each, with discounts available for siblings. GCSE core subjects such as the sciences, English and maths are catered for, as well as popular A-level topics such as economics, psychology and Spanish.

Meanwhile, specialist tour operator Ski Famille has been praised for its innovation after introducing private tuition from Tutor House for families staying in their chalets in 2015.

Managing director Chris Thompson said their chalet-based tuition at the Les Gets resort – which costs £649 for ten hours – could reassure parents worried their children would not have enough time to study because they spent too long on the slopes, ‘even though the children might not always appreciate the service’.

But Sir Anthony Seldon, headmaster of independent school Wellington College in Berkshire, has criticised the holiday tutorials initiative, saying: ‘It is an incredible waste of money to go on holiday and zap kids with lots of work.

‘They will get better results in their exams if they have had a good holiday. All the research suggests children are increasingly tired and stressed and they won’t work well unless they have a proper rest.’

Tutor House managing director Alex Dyer said his firm already ran holiday revision courses in London and the Val d’Isere initiative was a response to parental demand.

‘This idea has come from parents saying we want to go away as a family but we don’t want our son to mess up his GCSEs or A levels, so either he stays behind for the revision course or he comes with us and can’t do the course,’ said Mr Dyer. ‘So we thought we would provide the course where they are.’

He said he was planning to extend the courses to other resorts and had been in preliminary conversations with several companies.

Mr Dyer, who expects more than a third of students on the Easter course to be from state grammars or comprehensives, admitted that some teenagers would be ‘groaning and moaning’ at the prospect of studying on holiday.

‘But once they improve their grades and get into the college or university they want, they will see why it was worth it,’ he added.

A quarter of UK pupils now get some form of coaching, up from 18 per cent five years ago, says education charity the Sutton Trust.
