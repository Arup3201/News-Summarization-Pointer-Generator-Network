At first glance, this psychedelic satellite image looks like an alien landscape - but scientists say it and others like it could actually hold the key to accurately measuring the effect of climate change.

German researchers have developed a new technique using bright colours to show the spread of aquatic plants in lakes, and say it reveals a key indicator of the effect of climate change - and can be used to quickly analyse satellite images from around the globe.

Currently, divers have to make visual inspections to spot ‘invading’ plants which flourish due to changing temperatures.

With the help of aerial images - such as this one showing the western shore of Lake Starnberg - scientists are able to track the spread of certain aquatic plants. This information sheds light on the quality of the water (blue- bare sediment; green and yellow- sparse vegetation; dark red- dense vegetation)

For instance, Elodea nuttallii and Najas marina, better known as western waterweed and spiny naiad, have been spreading rapidly in German water bodies in recent years.

Ecologists are able to use them as indicator plants. Their proliferation allows researchers to draw conclusions on water quality – Elodea nuttallii and Najas marina are particularly common in lakes with rising water temperatures. The rapid spread of such plants over a wide area can upset the balance of sensitive lake ecosystems.

Now researchers at the Technische Universität München have written software that can spot the invading plants from space.

‘This new idea involves replacing some 
of the diving effort with high-resolution aerial and satellite images,’ 
said project supervisor Dr. Thomas Schneider.

‘In order to draw conclusions on plant growth from the imagery produced, we measure reflectance.

‘Each plant species reflects the incident light in a specific way, depending on its pigmentation and structure.'

The team found every lake has its own reflectance characteristics and they have created a library of plants.

‘It took us two years to photograph the plants from a boat and measure their reflectance,’ said doctoral student Patrick Wolf.

The scientists use cameras and sensors to photograph plant populations from a boat (left) and then measure the reflectance spectra of submerged plants. The camera (right) is attached to the end of the extension arm to eliminate shadow over the photographed areas
