Pete Russell has been named the new coach of Great Britain men's senior team.

The 40-year-old led the Under 20's to the gold medal at the world championships in December and takes over from Doug Christiansen who resigned last June after 11 months in charge.

Telford Tigers coach Tommy Watkins, assistant to Russell with the U20's, and Edinburgh Capitals player-coach Richard Hartmann will join him in the new coaching set-up.

Russell is Britain's most successful junior coach, winning four golds, one silver and two bronze medals in 11 tournaments in charge of the U18's and U20's.

His first campaign for the senior team will be April's World Championship (Division 1B) in Holland.

Russell said: 'This is the proudest moment of my hockey career and I am so thrilled to be the new head coach. My passion for GB runs deep and now to be coach of the men's side is just fantastic.

'I know so many of the GB players having coached them in the junior sides in years gone by. I know how much they care and how much they love their country.

'Becoming head coach of GB men has always been an ambition of mine and I now want to do Great Britain proud in my time in charge.

'This is a dream come true for me and I can't wait to get going. It's a new beginning for Great Britain men and I will select my team - one to start a new era for GB.'
