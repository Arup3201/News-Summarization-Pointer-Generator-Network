A sexy blackjack dealer who helped bring down married Congressman Anthony Weiner when she revealed they had a nine-month 'sexting' relationship has apologised on his Facebook page for exposing him, it emerged today.

Las Vegas croupier Lisa Weiss left a message below a picture of Weiner with his wife Huma Abedin and young child saying she was sorry for causing his family family pain.

Weiner had been married for less than a month when he started flirting heavily with the casino worker in August 2010 in a relationship that saw him send her more than 220 sexy texts and Facebook messages.

In June 2011, Miss Weiss, 42, agreed to go public and become the first woman named of six who the Republican admitted to sending lewd messages and photos in a scandal that forced him from office.

Writing on his Facebook page, Miss Weiss said: 'So great to see you back! Your wife and son are beautiful!

'Please let me apologize again for any pain I caused your (sic) or the beautiful Huma... it was unintentional... I still think you are our liberal hero and we need you back in politics!!'

A picture of the Facebook page was posted on www.buzzfeed.com today.

In an explosive interview with RadarOnline that contributed to Weiner's downfall, Miss Weiss revealed a sexually charged Facebook conversation in which he discussed his 'package' with the croupier, who invited him to Las Vegas for a sexual encounter.

Weiner started by saying: 'Ridiculous bulge in my shorts now. wanna see?'

To which, she replied: 'Yea! can u send a pic?'

He then said he would 'take a quick pic,' before adding: 'It wont go away. and now im taking pics of it. making me harder still.'

At one point Weiner even asked whether his social networking pen pal gave 'good' oral sex. On March 16, he wrote: 'You give good head?

She responded:'I’ve been told really good...and i love doing it.'

Weiner replied: 'wow a jewish girl who sucks (bleep)! this thing is ready to do damage.'

Miss Weiss, a former Democratic Party 
worker, said she had attempted to contact Weiner in the wake of the 
infamous 'crotch shot' picture on Twitter.

The scandal broke after Weiner sent a link with a photo of his crotch to a 21-year-old college student in Washington state, but it inadvertently appeared briefly on his public Twitter profile.

Accusations: Other women, including porn star Ginger Lynn (pictured), later emerged to say they had exchanged sexual messages with Weiner

He initially denied that he had sent the message and said his account had been hacked.

However, five days later, when more pictures and a second woman emerged, he admitted to sending inappropriate messages to women before and after his marriage to Ms Abedin, who was pregnant when the scandal broke.

Miss Weiss said at the time: 'I wanted him to know that I had no intention of coming forward and our past was going to be kept hush hush.

'But he was a dog and didn’t return my messages. I discovered that Anthony is a bad man.'

Other women, including porn star Ginger Lynn, emerged to say they had exchanged sexual messages with Weiner.

On June 16, 2011, after pressure from his own party, Weiner resigned from Congress.

Last month, Weiner returned to Twitter for the first time since the scandal when he sent a message just hours after Barack Obama's re-election was confirmed.

The former U.S. representative from New York sent out a link to a video appeal on behalf of the Rockaways, the coastal region of Queens which is part of his old congressional district.

The YouTube clip features footage of the devastation wrought on the area by Superstorm Sandy.

While the timing was obviously determined above all by Sandy, the fact that it came at the very start of the new political cycle may be no coincidence.

The next big election in New York will be next autumn's race for mayor of New York City - a position which Weiner was widely expected to seek before his resignation.
