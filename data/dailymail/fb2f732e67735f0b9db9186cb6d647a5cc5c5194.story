Health officials are searching cancer records after revelations of 16 people who lived within a kilometre of a Melbourne factory died from asbestos-related diseases.

The Herald Sun reports five acres of land at the Wunderlich asbestos factory in Sunshine North were covered in asbestos dust for 20 years from the mid-1950s.

Research has so far identified 25 people who lived near the factory who later died or became ill with asbestos-related illnesses.

Health Minister David Davis said the news was 'very troubling' and the health department was investigating.

'They obviously have access to some of the cancer registries, which may be helpful in understanding what has gone on in that area,' Mr Davis told reporters on Sunday.

But he stopped short of telling Victorians who grew up in the area to get health checks, saying he was waiting for the health department's data.

'If there's advice to be given to the community, we'll certainly do that,' he said.

Slater and Gordon lawyer Margaret Kent said the law firm had represented many Wunderlich victims in their fight for compensation.

'These people did not work at the Wunderlich factory, yet they became ill because companies failed to carry out their environmental obligations,' Ms Kent said on Sunday.

'Mothers were exposed as they walked their children to and from school, children became ill as they rode their bikes past the factory or played in the mounds of asbestos behind the site.'

Wunderlich was sold to CSR in 1969 and the company has paid compensation to some victims.

CSR sold the factory to James Hardie in 1977, before it stopped operating in the 1980s.
