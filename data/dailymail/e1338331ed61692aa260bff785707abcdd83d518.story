A female soldier claimed that she made $400 a night at Fort Hood sex parties after being recruited as part of a prostitution ring at the Texas base.

The allegations were made in documents relating to court-martial in which a sergeant is accused of attempting to use the service.

Master Sergeant Brad Grimes was in military court this week, accused of participating in the prostitution ring set up by another sergeant who has not yet been charged.

Charges: A Fort Hood sergeant has been found guilty of conspiracy to solicit a prostitute

The allegations are the latest in a series of claims about sexual harassment and sex-related crimes in the forces.

Grimes, a married serviceman who has served in Iraq and Afghanistan, was found guilty of conspiracy to pay for sex from a Fort Hood private.

He was allegedly approached by Sergeant 1st Class Gregory McQueen who offered to arrange a tryst with a young soldier.

McQueen, who served as the sexual assault prevention officer, is currently being investigated over claims that he recruited cash-strapped female soldiers for sex parties at the base.

The defense attorney for Grimes said there had been no talk of exchanging money for sex and added that his client decided not to go ahead with the meeting, after it was set up at a hotel.

'At the end of the day, Master Sgt Grimes chose to do the right thing and not have sex with that young lady,' Daniel Conway said. 'This is really a case about sex parties and Master Sgt Grimes had nothing to do with that.'

A female army private told the court-martial that Grimes paid her $100 to have sex with him at a hotel, YNN reported.

She also testified against McQueen, claiming he recruited her for the prostitution ring.

The attorney argued that Grimes had been charged after he rejected a deal to testify against McQueen.

In documents seen by the Austin-American Stateman, the allegations against McQueen were made when a young private told officials he had tried to recruit her to have sex with high-ranking soldiers.

The unnamed soldier claimed the woman Grimes was accused of meeting had told her she made 'like $400 to $500' at Fort Hood parties, according to the documents.

The private also claimed that McQueen 'preys on young females who are in bad financial situations and that he keeps their pictures on his cell phone,' a sworn statement seen by the Statesman said.

No formal charges have been made against McQueen.

At the conclusion of the court-martial yesterday a military panel found Grimes was found guilty of conspiracy to patronize a prostitute and solicitation to commit adultery.

He was cleared of patronizing a prostitute and committing adultery and has been demoted to a lower rank, KWTX reported.

Grimes' attorney distanced the case from the sexual harassment scandals in the forces, saying: 'It has nothing to do with sexual assault.'
