Authorities announced today that the Canadian tourist found floating dead in a water tank remains a mystery; the results of her autopsy have come back 'inconclusive.'

The Los Angeles County Coroner's office said there was no signs of trauma on Eliza Lam's body. Medical examiners must now wait for toxicology tests to determine whether she was under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of her death on February 1.

The health department has ruled the water in the Cecil Hotel in downtown Los Angeles as safe, despite Lam's body decomposing in a cistern that is connected to water taps throughout the building. But guests are fleeing the hotel in droves.

This isn't the first grisly find at the Cecil - a hotel with a dark history that was home to two known serial killers.

Tragic: Police have identified the body as Elisa Lam who disappeared on January 31 after taking a solo trip to Southern California from Canada

Found: Lam was found wedged in the water tank above the Cecil Hotel by a maintenance worker after guests complained of low water pressure

The hotel, built in the 1920s but 
refurbished several years ago, was the once occasional home to 1980s serial 
killers Richard Ramirez - nicknamed the Night Stalker - and Jack 
Unterweger.

Ramirez was convicted of murdering 13 people and is currently waiting execution in California. Unterweger, an Australian journalist, was found to have killed 11 prostitutes across Europe and the United States.

In the 1920s and 30s, several murders
 were committed in the hotel. In 1962, a 27-year-old woman leaped to her
 death from a window and killed a pedestrian on the street below when 
she landed on her.

Goldie Olsen, a well-known Los 
Angeles face known as the 'pigeon lady of Pershing Square,' was found 
strangled to death in her room at the hotel.

It was revealed on Wednesday that guests at the Cecil drank, bathed in and brushed their teeth with water from a roof-top tank where a Canadian tourist's body floated, decomposing, for nearly three weeks.

Authorities confirmed that the body found in a tank on Tuesday was Lam, a 21-year-old University of British Columbia who disappeared on February 1.

Police
 still don't know how Lam died or even how she ended up on the roof of 
the hotel - which is protected by locked doors and an alarm.

A police source told the Los Angeles Times that her death may have been accidental.

Los Angeles Police detectives have 
characterized her disappearance as suspicious, but have not released 
details about she ended up in a closed-off cistern. 

Tourists staying at the run-down Skid Row hotel said they were shocked by the discovery of a body in the hotel's water supply.

'The water did have a funny taste,' Sabrina Baugh, a British tourist who used the water in the hotel for eight days, told CNN.

'We never thought anything of it. We thought it was just the way it was here.'

Ms Baugh and her husband Michael said they were disgusted by the revelation.

Investigation: Police are now working to determine if the woman's death was accidental or a homicide

'The moment we found out, we felt a 
bit sick to the stomach, quite literally, especially having drank the 
water, we're not well mentally,' Mr Baugh said.

Los Angeles County health officials 
said they are testing the water to determine whether it is contaminated.
 The water in the tank where Lam was found feeds taps and showers in the
 hotel rooms, as well as a coffee shop and the kitchen downstairs.

'Our biggest concern is going to be fecal contamination because of the body in the water,' Terrance Powell said.

Investigators are now working to determine whether foul play was involved in Lam's death with an autopsy scheduled for Thursday.

Law enforcement sources told the Times that a locked door and fire escape are the only ways to access the hotel's roof.

The door, which only employees can reach, is also equipped with an alarm that notifies hotel staff if someone is up there.

The water tank is also hard to access requiring authorities to work well into the afternoon to remove her body after a maintenance worker discovered it on Tuesday morning.

'The location of the water tanks is very small and configured in a very tight way so it's a little more difficult to get the body out,' said police spokeswoman Officer Sara Faden.

Luxury: The Cecil Hotel is a two-star hotel in downtown Los Angeles where Elisa Lam was staying during her visit to the city

Stange behavior: A surveillance camera on the elevator at the Cecil captured Lam acting in a peculiar, paranoid way  the night she vanished

Lam stayed in touch with her friends and family while traveling in California - up until the day she disappeared.

A security video taken in an elevator
 at the hotel and released by the LAPD last week showed Lam acting 
strangely, hiding in a corner and repeatedly peering around the elevator
 doors into the hallway.

She never checked out of the hotel 
positioned on the outskirts of Skid Row and employees said they never 
saw her with anyone else.

Her body was discovered in one of 
four large water tanks after a maintenance worker went up to investigate
 reports of low water pressure, a Los Angeles police spokeswoman said.

Bernard Diaz, 89, who has lived at 
the Cecil for 32 years, told the LA Times that he heard a 'tremendous' 
racket on his floor above him the night Lam disappeared.

He said the floor also experience flooding that night.

Area: Police say there have been reports of continuing crime at the hotel built in the 1920s but refurbished several years ago

'They said there was some obstruction to the drain between the third and fourth floor,' Mr Diaz told the Times.

Some two dozen firefighters could be 
seen cutting through one of the four large, cylindrical water tanks 
under a canopy that shielded them from news helicopters overhead.

Police have said that the reason for 
Lam's visit to Los Angeles was unclear, but that her final destination 
was expected to be Santa Cruz in central California.

She speaks Cantonese as well as English and was known to use public transportation such as trains and buses.
