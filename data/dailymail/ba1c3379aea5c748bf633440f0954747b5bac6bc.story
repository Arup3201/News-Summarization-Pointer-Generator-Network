The Duchess of Cambridge may have come under fire for all three of her kitchen refurbishments, but it seems that she'll be putting her up-to-the-minute appliances to good use.

TV chef Rachel Khoo has revealed that Kate has been brushing up on her culinary skills at Leith's cookery school, a reputable teaching facility with alumni including Gizzi Erskine, Lorraine Pascale and Xanthe Clay.

Speaking to Woman magazine, Rachel, who shot to fame  in the BBC Two cookery show The Little Paris Kitchen, said: 'Kate was in my class. Kate was 
ill for a few days, so I took notes for her. She was a lovely person, 
but she kept herself to herself.'

Leiths School of Food and Wine is situated in West London and claims on its website to have 'an international reputation as a first class culinary institute for chefs'. You'd hope so; a two-week course costs around £1,600.

'Students come from all over the world to enjoy dedicated teaching in a friendly atmosphere. The guiding principle is to impart enthusiasm for the food and wine trade and instil a lasting love of good food and wine,' reads the website.

Cooking up a storm: With the skills she learned at the £1,600 cookery course, Prince George and William are surely in for a culinary feast

'This is not restricted to career cooks - many enthusiastic amateurs join us in our varied programme of courses and our diverse range of special events.'

The teaching staff are trained professional chefs, with experience in the real world of restaurants and commercial catering and renowned chefs, cookery writers and Masters of Wine regularly demonstrate or lecture at the school.

The cookery course news comes just after we
 learned that she is having a second kitchen installed in her Kensington
 Palace apartment, as well as at Anmer Hall.

Kate and William have splashed out on a sleek, modern new kitchen - full of restaurant-standard 
equipment with the finest furnishings and underfloor heating beneath a 
reclaimed stone floor.

The
 focal point of the room is said to be a dining table for at least eight
 people. Kate has taken advice from food writer Tom Parker Bowles (her 
mother-in-law Camilla’s son) who loves a large dinner party in a 
kitchen.

Perfectly polite: Rachel said that Kate, pictured last week at Wimbledon with husband William, kept herself to herself but was a 'lovely person'

Kate
 and William have already kitted out Kensington Palace with these 
products and are now said to be installing one of the giant 
fridge-freezers at Anmer Hall.

Also
 used by Coleen Rooney, Victoria Beckham, Bernie Ecclestone, Sir Paul 
McCartney, Madonna and Rod Stewart, these monolithic fridges come 
complete with an air-purification system invented by Nasa that kills 
bacteria, automatic icemakers which make crescent-shaped cubes (said to 
melt more slowly) and lights on every shelf so no forgotten food ever 
goes mouldy at the back.

A special salad drawer is kept a few degrees cooler to keep the royal rocket and radishes crisp.

The Cambridges have also 
invested in a £8,000 Wolf double-oven with (separately) five induction 
rings on a black ceramic hob, which boasts an ‘eye-catching’ cobalt blue
 interior (useful for spotting burnt-on food), and ten different 
‘cooking modes’ which vary temperature and airflow at the touch of a 
button depending on whether Kate is baking a cake or cooking a roast.

Learning at the best: Leiths School of Food and Wine is situated in West London and claims on its website to have 'an international reputation as a first class culinary institute for chefs'

But
 it seems perfectionist Kate is set on having only the best of the best:
 a £149.99 Dualit four-slice toaster in silver (a favourite among Sloane
 friends) and a £420 KitchenAid mixer (a Middleton stalwart) are all on 
the list. 

A set of 
£159 restaurant-standard, hand-made Sabatier Perrier knives from France 
(this brand is one of the oldest knife-makers in the world) are 
included, too. And that is not to forget the quick-boil kettle, a £1,000
 state-of-the-art coffee maker (at this price, it will be 
barrista-quality and able to make lattes, cappuccinos and flat whites at
 the touch of a button) and crystal and glass from William Yeoward. 
Here, champagne glasses are around £169 each, water glasses, £45.95 and a
 simple water jug £92.

Kate’s
 perfectionism also extends to the health of herself and her family, 
and, of course, her figure. The kitchen will feature a £100 silver 
‘Nutribullet’ blender, the very latest juicer that keeps the goodness 
from the fibre in the drink.

Like many 
building works, the Anmer project has apparently overrun, which means 
that the talked-about summer party there has been delayed.

There is speculation that Kate is concerned about being so far away from her parents if she spends too much time in Norfolk.

But
 then again, once she’s finally moved into this showcase of modern 
efficiency and luxury, she might discover she doesn’t mind quite so 
much.
