Alex Salmond could have his eye on a new official residence for after the referendum – in the form of his own castle.

The Scottish First Minister has long shown an interest in the historic Governor’s House in Edinburgh, which comes complete with turrets.

Officials have now issued an urgent demand for the 200-year-old property to be brought back into use after Thursday’s vote. 

They want a generator to be installed, so it will never lose power in the event of an emergency.

This is generally reserved for high-profile government buildings and has led to speculation that Mr Salmond may be planning to move.

First Ministers currently live at Edinburgh’s Bute House, but civil servants admitted in 2011 they were looking at alternatives. 

A Scottish Government spokesman said no decisions had been made regarding Governor’s House.

Will Alex Salmond be living in Governor's House in Edinburgh if he is successful in Thursday's referendum?
