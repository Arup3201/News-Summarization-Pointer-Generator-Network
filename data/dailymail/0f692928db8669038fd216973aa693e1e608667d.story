Three people were killed and twenty two were injured following clashes between anti-government protestors and police in Thailand.

The violence has flared over planned elections in July which are likely to be postponed because of the ongoing tension.

Caretaker prime minister Niwattumrong Boonsongpaisan was holding a meeting with the country's Election Commission when protestors stormed a military compound where the talks were taking place.

Protestors stormed the Royal Thai Airforce base in Bangkok to disrupt a meeting between the nation's interim Prime Minister and the Election Commission

More than 100 protestors managed to get past riot police to bring an end to the meeting to fix a date for the next general election

The Prime Minister was forced to flee the military compound after 100 protesters entered through a side gate, despite a heavy police and military presence.Â 

Protestors blew whistles and flew Thai flags forcing security officials to evacuate the Prime Minister and several of his cabinet. The protesters were followed into the air force academy by opposition leader Suthep Thaugsuban.

Lt General Paradom Pattanathabutr said: 'The government side agreed that we should leave for our own safety,' said Lt. Gen. Paradorn Pattanathabutr, a senior government official who attended the meeting. 'The protesters wanted to get in, so we had to leave in our vehicles immediately.'

He said the government has suggested that future meetings be held by teleconference.

Anti-government protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban said the planned election on July 20 could not go ahead

After the commotion ended, Election Commissioner Somchai Srisuthiyakorn cast doubt on the likelihood of an election taking place July 20 - a date the commission had selected but still requires a royal endorsement to become official.

'It looks like it will be impossible for the general election to take place on July 20.'

Last week, Thailand's constitutional 
court removed former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra and nine of her cabinet over claims of nepotism.

Protesters
 want the courts to install a 'neutral' prime minister, although senior 
government figures suggest this would be a 'judicial coup'.

Since the protests begun in November, almost 30 people have been killed and an estimated 800 injured

Government political sources claim that any attempt to 'impose' a new prime minister would result in a 'judicial coup'

Several hours after the meeting with the government and the Election Commission was abandoned, security forces attacked protestors near the Bangkock Democracy Monument, where demonstrators have been camping out over the past six months.

Police Colonel Krailert Buakaew said at least three grenades were detonated and machine guns fired at the protestors during the early morning attack.

Colonel Buakaew said one sleeping protester and a volunteer guard were both killed during the attack.

The Erawan Medical Centre said at least three people were killed and 21 wounded. Since the protests begun in November, 28 people have been killed and approximately 800 injured.

Former popular prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra was deposed by a military coup in 2006 after the telecoms billionaire was accused of being corrupt and disrespecting King Bhumibol Adulvedej.
