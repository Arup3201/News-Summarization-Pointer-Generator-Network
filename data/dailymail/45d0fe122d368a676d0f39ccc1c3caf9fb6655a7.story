Roberto Martinez claimed the Europa League would aid Everton's development but it seems the Blues have already benefited from the competition after just one fixture.

Dispatching of Wolfsburg with an impressive 4-1 victory, optimism is sky high once more.

Thursday night’s clash felt more like a celebration of Everton’s return to European football rather than the tough Group H fixture it had been billed as.

Such was the ease of the win, each goal and attack felt almost like a showreel of the memorable moments Evertonians will hope to witness this term against the continent’s best sides.

To add to the magic and nostalgia a night game on Merseyside brings, the Toffees have installed brand new floodlights which certainly boosted the atmosphere – European football had officially returned to Goodison Park.

However, with all the excitement Everton left back Bryan Oviedo - closing in on full fitness having broken his leg in January – appeared to arrive at the ground late. Cue mad panic from one particular steward who frantically attempted to get the wideman seated and primed for the action.

Had the Costa Rican turned up two minutes late for Everton's previous home game - against Chelsea - he'd have missed the current Premier League leaders opening two goals!

One man who was on time was Manchester City Edin Dzeko, sat in the Goodison Road stand to watch his former club Wolfsburg. Leaving with five minutes to go, the Bosnian will be disappointed to have missed Ricardo Rodriguez’s consolation free-kick.

Everton's ability to make top-class opposition look so ordinary was hugely impressive and the performance felt like the start of something big for the blue half of Merseyside. The Blues certainly hit top gear on their ‘Road to Warsaw’ and manager Martinez will be confident his side can go far in this season's tournament.

There was an expectancy the Blues would deliver as soon as the first few corners and free-kicks were met with that famous Goodison roar. There was a definite buzz in the air as Everton marked their return to European football in style.

However, while Everton deserved their victory, it was a bizarre match. Despite seeing their side score four goals, Blues fans picked goalkeeper Tim Howard as their Man of the Match. It was one of those games; open for the majority but it has to be noted the Toffees’ win was never in doubt at any point during the game.

A bizarre match followed a surreal start to the evening – not only were Everton not allowed to walk out to the iconic ‘Z Cars’ song under UEFA regulations but some fans will have been devastated to learn that beer was also banned in the ground!

Back on the pitch, with this year’s Europa League winners gaining automatic entry into next season’s Champions League, Everton will be eager to build on their enthralling start to the campaign.

Both sides showed Europe’s secondary competition the full respect it deserves by playing their strongest teams which, of course, made for a better match in terms of tactics and play; a real match-up of the Barclays Premier League and Bundesliga’s fifth-best clubs.

While the football was entertaining from start to finish, one of the biggest cheers of the night came as Darron Gibson was introduced from the bench following an eleven-month spell on the sidelines through injury.

Delighted to see the midfielder return, the Goodison faithful gave the 26-year-old a rousing reception in another extremely positive moment of the 90 minutes.

Gibson later said on social media: ‘Been a long hard 11 months for me, absolutely delighted to get back on that pitch tonight! Great win by the lads.’

It seems it was smiles on faces for everyone connected with the club as two of Everton’s summer arrivals, youngsters Brendan Galloway and David Henen, were seen laughing and joking outside the ground ahead of kick-off – settling in well on Merseyside.

Pundit Peter Reid – a member of the Everton team who defeated Bayern Munich in 1985 during one of Goodison’s greatest nights - was delighted too, happy to see the club perform so well on their return and could not hide his pleasure on the ITV4 sofa.

With the Everton camp on cloud nine, Wolfsburg’s night didn’t go to plan at all.

After defender Rodriguez was unlucky to see the ball ricochet off him and into his own net, the game was halted as goalkeeper Diego Benaglio left the field of the play – much to the bemusement of fans around the ground.

Some rumours quickly circulated the Swiss goalkeeper requested to quickly go off to replace a contact lens while other whispers, perhaps mischievously, claimed Benaglio had to leave the field in order to take a toilet break. Not ideal timing.

Ahead of kick-off Wolfsburg’s vocal support had made themselves known, loud and brash, unfurling huge flags in the Lower Bullens.

However, with the game as good as over just minutes into the second half that exuberance quelled as trouble brewed among the away fans; add to that sightings of a streaker and it was all going on in one small corner of the ground.

The teams of German media personnel packed into the front of the Goodison press box will have probably written more about what went on off the pitch rather than the action on it.

As for Everton, following yet another classy win under Martinez, the feel-good factor continues to grow and looks set to sweep through Europe.
