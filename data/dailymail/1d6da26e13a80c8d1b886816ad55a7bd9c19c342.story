Samantha Brick appeared on ITV breakfast show, Lorraine, to defend her controversial writing career today.

The author, who shot to fame when she wrote the now infamous article that asked women not to hate her for her good looks, said that she doesn't regret anything she has penned so far.

'No I don't. I don't wish I hadn't said 
it,' Samantha told presenter, Kate Garraway. 'The thing is when you're writing those opinion pieces, it's like 
having a one-sided conversation with your girlfriends over a glass of 
wine or a coffee.

'So you're putting all your opinions across, and then 
they [the readers], with the help of social media, can put their 
opinions across.'

Honest: Samantha appears on Lorraine to give Kate Garraway the truth behind her controversial comments

And put their opinions across they certainly did. 'It was pretty phenomenal from the moment
the piece ran to be honest,' she said.

'I mean: my inbox was just full, my phone 
didn't stop ringing... People were contacting me from all over the 
world.

'I had these insane conversations
with producers from Australia, New York, Scandinavia...The first 24 
hours were just pretty phenomenal.'

But it wasn't just producers getting in touch. In the days after the piece, Samantha received thousands of messages, many of them cruel, and was on the wrong end of scores of Twitter taunts, including one from Dragons' Den star, Duncan Bannatyne.

'I couldn't even speak to my mum because I thought if I did, I thought I'd cry,' she told Garraway. 'I had to keep up that strong front really.'

Asked why she had written the piece in the first place, Samantha answered: 'I think because really from nursery, 
from the cradle, we're taught this idea of false modesty so if I said: "Oh, you look good today", you would say "oh, I don't
look so great today!, you would bat away the compliment.

Changed woman? Samantha told Garraway that she won't be upsetting anyone with her new book

The start: Samantha's 'beautiful' article was seen by more than a million people and she got a flood of abuse

'I also think I was able to write the 
piece because I'm in a really happy relationship and I live in France 
where women are really confident.

'It doesn't matter what they look like,
they own their space and they know they look good and I definitely 
think that was the vehicle behind being able to wrote a piece like that.'

And luckily for Samantha, loyal husband, Pascal, was behind her every step of the way. 'My husband agreed with what I wrote,' she said in response to Garraway's questions.

'He 
thinks women are really vicious to each another and he's very black and 
white in his views and he says what he thinks.

'He thought it was just bananas, the 
response to [the first piece]. He's not interested in celebrity culture or the 
lifestyle we all obsess over here.'

Discussion then turned to another controversial article, in which Samantha had asked whether some women might not be too ugly for TV - again provoking a storm of criticism.

'Well the piece was in response to the AA
Gill piece where he wrote about Mary Beard,' responded Samantha.

'In my defence with that, I 
worked as a TV producer for nearly 20 years and you only have to look at
the States, Oprah in her 60s, Barbara Walter in her 80s, and they're 
both incredible, intelligent women who absolutely make the best of 
themselves.

'If you look good, you can carry on and get your message 
across.

No regrets: Samantha says meeting Pascal and moving to France was the best thing that ever happened to her

'I wouldn't call [what she said] provoking a reaction.
I'd call it speaking the truth about the things people think but don't 
really want to talk about.'

She also found time to talk about her new book, Head Over Heels In France, which, she insists, won't offend anyone.

'It's a completely different style of 
writing,' she explained. '2007 was probably the worst and best year of my life. I lost my
TV company, I lost my home, I was penniless... and I had a fluke 
holiday in France, where I had a holiday romance.Â 

'Us women know that most of the time they
don't really pan out... Mine did, so in September 2007 I took the leap 
and moved to France, and my book really chronicles the 12 months where I
ended up getting married.

'And if someone had told me in 2006 that "you're going to live in France, you're going to be a French housewife, 
you'll embrace rural living" I'd have thought they were off their rocker
but I did, and it's the best thing that's ever happened to me to be 
honest.
