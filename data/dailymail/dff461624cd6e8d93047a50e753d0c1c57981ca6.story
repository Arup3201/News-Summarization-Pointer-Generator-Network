Daniel Ricciardo and Sebastian Vettel have been disqualified from the qualifying results ahead of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

The Red Bull drivers had originally qualified fifth and sixth for the race at the Yas Marina circuit, only for their cars to later be declared illegal due to an aerodynamic influence.

Ricciardo and Vettel, the latter in his final race for the team prior to joining Ferrari on a three-year contract from next year, are still allowed to start from the back of the grid.

Daniel Ricciardo had out-qualified his team-mate and was due to start fifth in the grid

Technical delegate Jo Bauer initially referred the matter to the stewards after discovering the 'front wing flaps were designed to flex under aerodynamic load,' which is against the regulations.

Via a statement, Red Bull suggested they were not the only team breaking the rules.

The statement read: 'Following the decision of the stewards regarding the front wings on both our cars, we are disappointed we have been singled out for a front-wing deflection test when it is clear other teams are interpreting the rules in a similar fashion.

'The team accepts the decision of the stewards and will start the race from the back of the grid.'
