* Lewis Hamilton can set a new British record with a 32nd F1 career victory as he is currently tied with Nigel Mansell on 31.

* Hamilton has nine victories to his name this season. Only Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel have won more in a single campaign - both have won 11 and 13 races in a season.

* This season Hamilton has won four races in a row on two separate occasions. Only Schumacher has achieved such a feat, winning seven and five in succession in 2004.

* No driver has ever lost a world title when winning four consecutive grands prix, and there have been 19 previous occasions.

* The win was also Hamilton’s 67th podium, edging him one head of Vettel on F1’s all-time list, and one behind sixth-placed Rubens Barrichello.

* With Nico Rosberg second last time out in Russia, Mercedes have nine one-two finishes this season, one behind McLaren’s 1988 record of 10 set by Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost.

* With Caterham and Marussia in administration and not competing this weekend, there will be just 18 cars lining up on the grid, the lowest number since the 2005 Monaco Grand Prix.
