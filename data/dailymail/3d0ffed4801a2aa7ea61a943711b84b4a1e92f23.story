Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling has been banned for life from the NBA and fined $2.5million after being found guilty of making racist comments on tape.

The 80-year-old had found himself at the centre of huge controversy in the USA after American network TMZ had broadcast Sterling apparently telling a girlfriend not to bring black people to the team's games.

Banned for life: Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling cannot be involved in the team's operations after racist comments allegedly made by him were made public

His comments had led to Clippers 
players making a silent protest ahead of their NBA Western Conference 
play-off series defeat to the Golden State Warriors on Sunday evening, 
while financial backers have been withdrawing their support for the 
club.

The NBA has taken a 
dim view of the furore and a statement on the league's Twitter account 
revealed Sterling had 'violated league rules through his expressions of 
offensive and hurtful views, the impact of which has been widely felt 
throughout the league'.

He 
is therefore banned from any association with the Clippers or the NBA, 
meaning he may not be allowed to attend any games or practice sessions.

The
 sanction also means Sterling may not 'be present at any Clippers office
 or facility, or participate in any business or player personnel 
decisions involving the team'.

NBA
 commissioner Adam Silver said at a news conference: 'The views 
expressed by Mr Sterling are deeply offensive and harmful. That they 
came from an NBA owner only heightens the damage and my personal 
outrage.

Tirade: The recording stemmed from a conversation between Sterling and his girlfriend V. Stiviano (right) after she posted this photo with Magic Johnson to her Instagram account

Disgusted: Several groups made their voices known before the clash against Sterling

Beverages: Corona, Red Bull

Travel: Virgin America, Amtrak

Vehicles: Kia, Mercedes-Benz, CarMax

Phone: Sprint

Local businesses: AQUAhydrate, Lumber Liquidators, Yokohama Tire Corporation, Commer Hotel & Casino, Southern California Ford dealers association,  Chumash Casino Resort, LoanMart 

'Sentiments of this
 kind are contrary to the principles of inclusion and respect that form 
the foundation of our diverse, multi-cultural and multi-ethnic league.

'I
 am personally distraught that the views expressed by Mr Sterling came 
from within an institution that has historically taken such a leadership
 role in matters of race relations, and caused current and former 
players, coaches, fans and partners of the NBA to question their very 
association with the league.

'To
 them - and pioneers of the game, like Earl Lloyd, Chuck Cooper, 
Sweetwater Clifton, the great Bill Russell and particularly Magic 
Johnson - I apologise.'

Silver
 will urge the NBA's governors to force Sterling to sell the Clippers, 
and the news was hailed by several prominent figures.

'Commissioner
 Silver showed great leadership in banning LA Clippers owner Donald 
Sterling for life,' said NBA great Magic Johnson on Twitter.

Protest: Los Angeles Clippers players held a silent protest over Sterling's comments

Voice heard: A man carries a poignant message as people gathered to protest outside Staples Center

'Current and former NBA players now know that in Commissioner Adam Silver we have a great leader leading our league.'

Miami
 Heat star man LeBron James said on the social networking site: 
'Commissioner Silver thank you for protecting our beautiful and powerful
 league!! Great leader!! #BiggerThanBasketball #StriveForGreatness.'

Dallas
 Mavericks owner Mark Cuban added: 'I agree 100% with Commissioner 
Silvers findings and the actions taken against Donald Sterling.'

While questions remain concerning Sterling's future ownership of the team, and the impact of his comments on the players, the NBA's stern decision has unquestionably lightened the Clippers load.

'I am drained,' Rivers told reporters before the start of Game Five against the Golden State Warriors in their best-of-seven playoff series, which they won 79-74 to take a 3-2 lead.

'But not drained enough not to go out and coach this game.

'I thought that was the sigh of relief we needed,' Rivers said, referring to Silver's announcement earlier in the day. 'Is this over? No, it's not over. But it's the start of a healing process that we need.

'We're going to let this whole thing run its course and then we'll all have better clarity. I want my players to be comfortable, honestly. I think that's the most important thing.'

Silver, who has urged the NBA's owners to vote to force Sterling to sell the Clippers, has received universal backing throughout the league for his handling of the incident.

'My team mates and I are in agreement with his decision,' said Clippers guard Chris Paul, who is also the NBA's Players Association president.

'We appreciate the strong leadership from Commissioner Silver and he has our full support.'Fans at the Clippers' home Staples Center venue appeared to share Paul's sentiment, and the earlier ruling took the steam out of what was expected to be an unsettled environment.

Back on track: LA Clippers won the clash 113-103 at the Staples Centre to take a 3-2 lead in the playoffs
