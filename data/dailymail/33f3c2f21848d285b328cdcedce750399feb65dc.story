An 87-year-old man who cancelled a $2900 cruise because his sister was dying has been refused a refund because she was over 75 and not considered immediate family.

Alex Fraser was due to set sail from Sydney on a 16-day cruise around the Pacific Islands on March 2.

But the Wollongong resident was forced to cancel the America Holland cruise just two days before when his sister Jean Docherty, 81, was admitted to hospital with stomach cancer.

High seas: Alex Fraser was forced to cancel his America Holland cruise from Sydney to the Pacific Islands on March 2

Mr Fraser's sister died on March 5.

Even though he had paid an extra $200 for Vero travel insurance to cover himself in case a relative became ill or died, his refund claim was rejected by the company due to a clause in the product disclosure statement.

The policy defines the term 'relative' as an immediate family member under the age of 75.  

'Do you think I would sit by the bedside of a strange woman watching her die if she wasn't genetically associated with me,' Mr Fraser told MailOnline.  

'I was absolutely flabbergasted. How can (they) say something like that?'

The 87-year-old was told he couldn't get a refund on the cruise even though his sister had died because she was over 75

The grandfather of two provided a medical certificate and doctor's letter to prove Mrs Docherty had been in hospital but the claim was rejected purely based on her age.

Vero wrote: 'We acknowledge the late Jean Docherty is your sister and would be considered a relative under the normal dictionary meaning of the word, (but) 'relative' is specifically defined within the policy wording'.

'Relative means an immediate family member… under the age of 75.'

Vero's owner Suncorp is planning to overhaul its travel cover, according to the Daily Telegraph.

'We are about to launch a review and upgrade of our range of travel insurance policies, and the policy restrictions involved (in Mr Fraser's case) will definitely be a part of that review,' a spokesman said.

While the company said they will discuss the matter with Mr Fraser, he said he hadn't had much luck to date.

'When you try to part a Scotsman with his money you're in trouble,' he said.

The grandfather of two had planned the cruise back in December and was set on visiting Fiji and Vanuatu
