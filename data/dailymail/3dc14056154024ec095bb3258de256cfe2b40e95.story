A 23-year-old woman drove her car around for almost an hour without noticing there was an iPad lodged in her bumper - and when she prized it out it was hardly damaged.

Alexa Crisa, from Atlanta, Georgia, was driving around her town on Friday when a vehicle turned out in front of her and something came flying into her car.

The owner of the iPad had put it on the roof of his vehicle with his wallet and drove off.

She hit the brakes and stopped but because she didn't feel or see anything, she went about her day and drove around running errands for about an hour.

It was only after she came home and parked her car that her father Nick returned from work and noticed the iPad sticking out of the front of the car

Alexa said: 'I went to Target and ran errands with this iPad hanging out of my bumper. I had no clue. I'm not even sure how I missed it.'

'I went to Target and ran errands with this iPad hanging out of my bumper. I had no clue,' Crisa told ABCNews.com. 'I'm not even sure how I missed it other than I don’t check my bumper for random dislodged electronics.'

It was only after she came home and parked her car that her father Nick returned from work and noticed the iPad sticking out of the front of the car.

He said: 'I went into the house and said, "Why’s there an iPad stuck to the front bumper of the car?"' 

'I didn’t know. I mean, it was lodged so perfectly,' Alexa Crisa said.

The device was wedged in so deeply that Mr Crisa had to use a hammer to knock it out. And though the screen was smashed, it worked enough for the app to flash the owner's name and telephone number on to the screen.

Alexa was able to return the tablet to its owner, who revealed he had unwittingly left the iPad and his wallet on top of his car and drove off

'It was so remarkable that it was thrown from the roof of the car at 40mph and still looked like that,' Alexa said. 'It looked like nothing had happened to the back of the iPad.'

Alexa was able to return the tablet to its owner, who revealed he had unwittingly left the iPad and his wallet on top of his car and drove off.

He found his wallet in his driveway and got a new tablet through his Apple warranty plan.

He has offered to pay for the new bumper Alexa now needs for her car.

A picture of the iPad in Alexa Crisa’s 
bumper went viral with more than 1.5 million views after she posted it 
to her Facebook page.
