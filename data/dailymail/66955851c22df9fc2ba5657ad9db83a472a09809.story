His mother has the power to send sales of high-street designs sky-rocketing and it seems that Prince George is following in the Duchess of Cambridge's fashionable footsteps.

Within moments of Prince George's latest photos appearing online, the tills at Cath Kidston were ringing as parents rushed to get hold of the 16-month-old's £32 tank top. 

And now, sales of shoes worn by the tot’s in the photoshoot have gone through the roof, too.

Little trendsetter: Photos of Prince George wearing shoes by Norwich shoe-maker Start-Rite - whose walkers have been worn by royal children for more than 50 years - said demand had rocketed all over the world

Pictures of the adorable baby boy were only released on Sunday, but historic Norwich shoemaker Start-Rite - whose walkers have been worn by royal children for more than 50 years - said demand had rocketed all over the world.

Start-rite, which dates back 222 years, sold 10 times as many pairs of the Jo, Navy Blue Leather Boys Buckle First Walking Shoes in the last 48 hours as the whole of last week.

The  British shoes were designed in Norwich in 1998 - and are now selling faster than ever at £36 a pair.

Dealers and distributors around the globe have been frantically calling Start-Rite’s headquarters on Norwich’s Broadland Business Park to send them more of the shoes after the very public royal seal of approval sparked a customer rush worldwide, say the brand.

Thrilled: The shoe makers say it is a great morale boost for the staff  in Norwich and think it's great that the Duchess of Cambridge took time to get them fitted for him

Hot request: Managing director of Start-rite Shoes, Peter Lamble, said demand had rocketed all over the world

Chairman Peter Lamble, 53, said the high-profile endorsement by Prince George - or more likely his parents, William and Kate - caps a long line of happy Windsor family customers.

Mr Lamble said: 'We are delighted that the Duke and Duchess have selected Start-rite shoes for Prince George.

'It’s a great morale boost for the staff here in Norwich - and, of course, there is a commercial opportunity which could come from it as well.'

He added: 'For someone as busy as the Duchess is, it’s fantastic how important she thinks it is to take the time to get children’s shoes fitted.'

Cobbler and entrepreneur James Smith launched the Start-Rite enterprise - then called Southalls - by Norwich market back in 1792 as King George 111 reigned and the bloody French Revolution raged across the channel.

The company ended all UK production in 2003 - with its shoes now being made in India, Spain and Portugal - but they are still designed in Norwich.

The charming pictures of Prince George, the first official images since his first birthday in July, were taken in a courtyard at Kensington Palace and released by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

It is estimated that the Royal Family’s children have been fitted with more than 1,500 pairs of Start-rite shoes over the last half a century. 

It isn't just actual royalty that are fans of the shoes - fashion royalty love them, too. Victoria and David Beckham's daughter, Harper Seven, has also been seen sporting shoes by the brand. Myleene Klass and Katie Holmes also love kitting their daughter's out in the footwear. 

A spokesman for the brand added: 'Our classics range is seeing a resurgence and has been gathering a strong celebrity following, with Harper Beckham also being kitted out in our shoes.

'Being trusted by these discerning, fashionable parents can only continue to enhance Start-rite’s reputation for stylish, quality fitted footwear.'
