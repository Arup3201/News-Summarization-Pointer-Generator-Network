An Atlanta grandmother who was denied surgery on her 30-pound tumor by four different hospitals is celebrating her continuing recovery after the beachball-sized mass was removed from her stomach six weeks ago.

Doris Lewis, 59, had the enormous benign tumor removed during eight hours of surgey at Emory Hospital, after it began to threaten her life when it started crushing her internal organs.

'I probably would not be alive if that tumor had stayed in me. It would have taken my life,' said Lewis, who had no insurance.

'I feel grateful, thankful, happy,' she told WSB-TV – Atlanta.

Lewis wanted to thank the doctors and staff who helped her, 'If you ever have something that's going wrong with you, be strong and know that something can be worked out. Something can be done. Don’t give up hope.'

At first, Lewis said she didn't realize she had a tumor.

'I didn't know it was a tumor in there. I thought I was just gaining weight at first,' Lewis told WBS-TV.

But within just two months, the tumor had swollen to the size of a beach ball, and showed no sign of stopping.

Lewis went to various hospitals but none would help to relieve her of the tumor, which is benign but extremely painful.

'It's getting bigger every day,' she told WSB-TV.

'I can feel it on my body. My heart hurts a little bit.'

Recently, Lewis was in so much pain with the huge growth that she called 911 and was taken to Emory University Hospital in midtown.

Finally, a doctor told her that she would be treated, with or without insurance.

Doctors were amazed at the size of Lewis's tumor, telling her it was the largest they had ever seen.

'Some of the guys looked at me and said, "You got a tumor in there that is so big it's about to pop,"' Lewis told WSB-TV.
