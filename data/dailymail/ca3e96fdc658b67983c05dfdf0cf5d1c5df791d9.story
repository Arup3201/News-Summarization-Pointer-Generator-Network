Pictures and footage have emerged showing a man and his partner waving a giant Australian flag in the crowd at the Melbourne Cup - and the shocking moment Araldo flipped out and broke his leg on the way back to the mounting yard that led vets to put him down.

Channel Seven have identified a man in a green polo shirt and a black cap as Mark Schneider, who along with his partner was pictured on the fence celebrating the race with a huge flag.

Footage taken from the woman's phone, Channel Seven cameras and a camera mounted on the helmet of Araldo's jockey Dwayne Dunn capture the exact moment the horse spots the flag in the crowd and loses its composure - kicking a fence that shattered its leg.

It comes as Racing Victoria confirmed that flags would be banned for the remainder of the Melbourne Cup carnival - and that horses would be led back to mountain yard via a different route away from the crowd.

Racegoers claim that Mr Schneider thought the incident was funny - but he said in a statement to Seven News that he was 'shattered' and 'deeply shaken'

The man and his partner are then confronted moments later by angry punters in the crowd, who have accused the couple of finding it funny.

'A horse got hurt and you thought it was funny,' a racegoer says to Mr Schneider.

'You just put it up again.... the owners of Araldo have a million-dollar horse that's going to get the vet now saving its life because of you.'

'But you think it's funny. You laughed at security when he came up to you.

Mr Schneider told Seven News in a statement: 'As owners ourselves we are shattered at the events of yesterday ... regretting what unfolded and are deeply shaken,'

But a woman who witnessed the confrontation between Mr Schneider and the man in the crowd claims he wasn't initially bothered by Araldo's reaction.

'I don't think he really cared until he found out that the horse was injured.'

Admire Rakti, the pre-race favourite, also died shortly after the prestigious race, with a preliminary autopsy pointing to to acute heart failure and an irregular heart rhythm as the cause of death. 

VRC confirmed the rule changes to Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday evening, citing the safety and wellbeing of horses, participants, employees and other event patrons as the key reasons. 

The ban on flags will be in place for the remaining two days of the spring racing carnival, but it has not been confirmed whether these measures will be implemented permanently.

Julian Sullivan, VRC Acting Chief Executive, said the amendments had been implemented in direct response to Araldo sustaining a broken pastern when returning to the Mounting Yard on Tuesday. 

'While it is important not to respond in a knee-jerk manner, these interim arrangements will be implemented until procedures are reviewed after the Melbourne Cup Carnival,' Mr Sullivan said.

Horses will also be led along a different path after the race, a decision which was made in conjunction with Racing Victoria Chairman of Stewards Terry Bailey.

'Traditionally horses wait for the winner to lead them down the race, but will now enter the Mounting Yard in the order they return,' Mr Sullivan said.

'The larger crowds that gather for the Group 1 races will still have the opportunity to see the horses return to scale along the track.'

Earlier on Wednesday pictures emerged showing Araldo, which ran seventh, clearly distressed at the site of a large flag being waved by a member of the public - who then shattered its leg after freaking out and kicking a fence on the way back to the mounting yard.

Anthony Feroce, the racing manager of Araldo's stables, told the Herald Sun Melbourne Cup organisers should review crowd control measures after the freak incident, saying: 'It's not like car racing.'

The death of Araldo and pre-race favour Admire Rakti overshadowed victory for the German-trained Protectionist, who romped away with the biggest winning margin in nearly two decades, and also reignited a bitter debate about the ethical treatment of racing horses.

Dr Stewart said an autopsy was conducted for Admire Rakti on Tuesday night at the University of Melbourne and initial results point to acute heart failure and an irregular heart rhythm.

A full post mortem with microscopic and toxicology studies will take 10 days or more, he said.

'It's seen in racehorses and human athletes as well - in the large mass of the muscle of the heart, the electrical current has to get through in a coordinated way, and at high heart rates sometimes that can become short circuited,' Dr Stewart said. 

Admire Rakti, the pre-race favourite, finished last in the Melbourne Cup and almost walked across the line

'It happens more or less spontaneously with no warning.'

He initially said the horse suffered from 'sudden death syndrome', which occurs in just 0.007 per cent of racehorses.

The reason for Araldo’s demise was immediately clear. Speaking shortly afterwards, his trainer Mike Moroney said that the stallion had become distressed by a big flag and run off.

'They run the Melbourne Cup for 154 years and nothing like that has happened,' he said.

Anthony Feroce, racing manager at Mike Moroney's Ballymore stables, said the horse's death was a 'freakish accident', but he anticipated the Victoria Racing Club would review how close punters are allowed to get to Cup horses following the race.

'I think the Victoria Racing Club does a magnificent job, but possibly they could look at flags that close to where the horses go,' Mr Feroce said.

'Someone had a big flag and was waving it and right at the time when our horse went passed it and they're animals, they get spooked quite easily.'

Mr Feroce added that it was 'not fair' that racing was being portrayed as a cruel industry following the deaths of the two horses.

'All care is taken for their wellbeing and their welfare and I assure you, you've just got to talk to everybody involved and see how much love they have for the animals,' he said. 

'Now and then we do have unfortunate accidents that happen but that's no different to any other sport.'

The deaths of the two horses prompted an outpouring of comment online and reaction from animal charities who insist that racing is a cruel sport.
