A bingo-lover has been banned from his local hall - because he has Tourette's syndrome.  

Louis Bunn, 23, was ejected from the hall and banned, after staff thought his involuntary tics, shouting and swearing were deliberate efforts to disrupt people.

Mr Bunn, from Eastbourne in East Sussex was removed from the town's Leo Leisure Bingo hall on Sunday in the middle of a game.

Mr Bunn has claimed that, during the course of the evening, the bingo caller made fun of his accidental outbursts.

He said: 'A member of staff was very disrespectful to me and this made my tics worse.

'When I confronted the person  I told him I couldn't help it and that I was  being discriminated against.

'As the night went on, the staff working the bingo made a few remarks on the microphone regarding my Tourette's and I felt like I was being singled out.'

Mr Bunn said that he has doubled his dose of medication since the stressful incident.

Tourette’s syndrome is a neurological condition that affects the brain and nervous system.

Named after French doctor, Georges Gilles de la Tourette, who first described the syndrome in the 19th century, it is characterised by involuntary noises and movements. 

Tics are usually vocal (grunting, coughing and shouting) or physical, with typical movements including jerking the head or jumping up and down.

Most sufferers are first diagnosed during childhood and it is linked to ADHD and obsessive compulsive disorder.

But bingo hall owner, Peter Brown, defended his decision and said Mr Bunn had 'sworn and spat at' him.

Mr Brown, who knows Mr Bunn as a regular, said: 'I am aware of his condition and have never had a problem with it in any way.

'I've spoken to other people to make them aware of his condition and told them that he was a nice person.

'But we'd had a complaint in that week that he had jumped out of his seat and got very aggressive towards an old lady.

'I told him he was welcome to continue playing but we would not accept him being aggressive to customers.

'He was aggressive to me, my female members of staff and I was sworn and spat at. I've never been spoken to like that.'
