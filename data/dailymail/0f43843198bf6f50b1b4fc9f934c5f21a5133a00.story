Chavvy: Tulisa Contostavlos, Chelsee Healey and friends partying at the Ocean Club in Marbella

What a difference a few months can make. At the finals of The X Factor last December she was a goddess in a glittering beaded gown, made by rising designer Hollie de Keyser.

Thanks to stylists and the Cowell machine, she looked absolutely right next to a glamorous Nicole Scherzinger.

But the Tulisa who is whooping it up in Marbella this week is a rather different creature - in huge heels, an inadvisable amount of harsh make-up, a cheap bikini and even cheaper tattoos.

(The legend: 'Lucky You' inked just at her knicker line, seems a joke in particularly poor taste.)It's a striking reinvention - from glamour back to gutter, and let no one think that it is accidental.

Indeed, Tulisa seems depressingly happy to be back in her original role as Queen of the Chavs.

For as she said herself so eloquently in an interview just before The X Factor ended: 'I'm always going to be a hood chick. I like street clothes.'

She added defiantly: 'I'm an inspiration for Broken Britain. I'm comfortable in my skin, it just p****s me off that other people won't accept it.'

Simon Cowell thought that her 'real' views on The X Factor panel made a refreshing change from the showbizzy guff spouted by Louis Walsh et al.

But he grew tired of her - last week ITV bosses confirmed Sharon Osbourne will be returning to The X Factor to replace Tulisa in the next series.

So she is reclaiming her past, which lies in the gang culture of Camden, North London. Hence her no-label sunglasses, knock-off necklace and baseball cap.

Now she is wondering what can come next. She is reportedly 'determined' to make it in Hollywood as a film star.

But quite how they will take to the Queen of the Chavs is anyone's guess.

Tulisa had extensive dental work before starting on The X Factor, including veneers and a painful gum lift. The cost was £12,000 although she seems to have received the treatment for free, and then plugged the dental practice on Twitter.

Some serious bling - if it's actually Chanel that is and not just made from coloured nickel. In truth, the brand has nothing in its jewellery collection that would match up to this in size, and, of course, the label is much ripped-off. A similar massive 'Chanel' pendant can be bought online for £360.

Tulisa was the glam star of Saturday night TV

Tulisa loves a manicure, and has worn mint green and blue nails on The X Factor. She also uses stick-on embellished nails by the brand Nazila. Here she is wearing a classic red polish, perhaps by her favourite brand, Barry M, which costs £2.50.

From cheap and cheerful brand THB, this is a 'statement' bikini and costs £20.99. If you choose one of the preselected slogans such as 'Proppa Bang Tidy' or 'I'm In Ibiza, B***h' it costs £16.99,but Tulisa has paid the extra and had her own slogan: 'Don't Mess With My Style' etched on

Louis Walsh said that he could 'always' smell cigarettes on her and staff at The X Factor had to tell her that it was against the law to light up backstage on the show — but she and her friends apparently would do it regardless. Obviously she wasn't all that mortified by Gary Barlow's jibeabout her 'fag ash breath'.

Despite the wet and wild atmosphere at the Ocean Club in Marbella, Tulisa appears to have chosen to wear a pair of pricey Louboutins. The Very Prive shoes have a 10 cm heel and cost £525.

Branded with the logo of basketball team the Chicago Bulls, widely available for about £20.

These look like Carrera Drift  sunglasses, worth about £85,  but on closer inspection lack the branding. A stylist said: 'They look like a cheap knockoff from a market stall.'

Her favourite earrings, and even the efforts of stylist Gemma Sheppard haven't persuaded her to ditch them. She's had this pair for three years and they are said to be cheapo Golddiggaearrings worth about a fiver.

No cheapies - Tulisa is wearing a £25,000 Rolex with a diamond setting. It is thought she bought it for herself after landing The X Factor job in 2011. She's a fan of bling — she gave her (now ex) boyfriend Danny Simpson a £20,000 Rolex Daytona and they Tweeted pictures of their timepieces.

Tulisa was seen spraying Veuve Clicquot Brut yellow label around. It costs £36 a bottle, but given that the event she was pictured at was sponsored by Veuve Clicquot, it was probably free. Her favourite drink is white wine, and she said in an interview that she started drinking when she was aged 12.

A collect ion of tattoos, the largest of which is a unicorn on her shoulder which she had done in2010. She has since added a 'The Female Boss' inking on her forearm after her debut album. Onher lower back, she has the lyrics to her track Intro: 'She is strong when she is weak, She is brave when she is scared, She is humble when she is victorious.' This tattoo was first seen inApril on another holiday in Vegas.

And there is a new tattoo which reads 'Lucky You' and features a  Shamrock, peeking just above her bikini line. This is thought to have been done in February, at Demon Ink in Gosforth, Tyne and Wear, at the same time as her now ex-boyfriend having an inkingon his ribs.

How she was: Tulisa has regressed to her 2009 chav self, her next plan? She is reportedly 'determined' to make it in Hollywood as a film star
