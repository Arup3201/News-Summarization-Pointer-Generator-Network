Christopher Povey created fake parking tickets using his home computer

A conman created fake parking tickets using his home computer - and slapped them on 150 cars in just two hours.

Christopher Povey, an unemployed father-of-three, targeted cars on roads in Sale and Timperley, Greater Manchester, and then photographed them.

The tickets demanded motorists pay a £60 fine or £35 within 10 days and told them to send a cheque to a PO Box address.

Four drivers fell for the scam and sent cheques, but police were alerted by suspicious residents.

Povey, 41, was today found guilty of fraud.

Trafford magistrates’ court heard how Povey designed and printed the yellow tickets on his home computer before placing them in black waterproof wallets.

The court was told Povey set up a company called Highways Safety Monitoring Partnership in May 2011 and each notice had a crest with the name on the top.

He put the tickets on the cars between 8.30pm and 10.30pm on Monday, September 12.

Police were contacted and the cheques intercepted before he was arrested.

It was discovered Povey had set up a bank account, a PO Box address for HSMP and ordered ‘joke fake parking tickets’ and plastic wallets from a website.

Representing himself at Trafford magistrates’ court, Povey said he wanted to take action against motorists after a near-miss with a mother and pushchair because cars were obstructing the pavement.

He said he was conducting a ‘dry run’ of a study and would have returned or destroyed any cheques he received.

Povey claimed he wanted HSMP to work in partnership with the local authority.

He told the court: 'I am financially stable, there is no reason I would want to commit any type of fraud.'

The prosecution said only the council and police can issue parking notices in Trafford.

District Judge Mark Hadfield found Povey guilty of four charges of fraud by false representation and he was given a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £775 costs and £10 compensation to a woman charged for cancelling a cheque.

Judge Hadfield said: 'It seems to me your account has inherent weaknesses. You were doing what one would expect a traffic warden to do, affix parking tickets to vehicles and take photos of them obstructing the highway.

'You said you wanted to work with a local authority but made no effort to contact and work with them. You produced notices that gave the real impression they were official parking tickets.

'I accept your general concern for parking, but you acted in a dishonest way to obtain money from motor vehicle owners.

'There were no means by which you could return the cheques and that reinforces my view that you were acting in a dishonest manner.'
