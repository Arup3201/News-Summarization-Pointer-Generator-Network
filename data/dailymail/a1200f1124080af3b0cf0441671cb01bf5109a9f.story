No one expected this. Less than a week after he lifted the World Cup trophy in Rio de Janeiro, Germany captain Phillipp Lahm has retired from international football.

Yes, there had been the odd report prior to the World Cup. Lahm himself had admitted in February that he would not rule it out as a possibility. But it didn’t seem like a real consideration. Few believed him.

Many still didn’t believe it as Bild reported the story on Friday morning. It wouldn’t have been the first time that the newspaper’s anonymous sources had been mistaken.

But by mid morning, Lahm’s agent had confirmed the rumour. The Bayern player was stepping down from international duties with immediate effect.

'It is the right time for me to go,' said Lahm.

With 30 years and 113 caps, Lahm is certainly not leaving in his prime. His departure will nonetheless be a hammer blow for Germany. Throughout the tournament in Brazil, he proved himself not only to be one of the most tactically intelligent and diverse players on the planet, but also a worthy leader.

He had to fight for that accolade, with many questioning his strength and leadership qualities along the way. Others saw him as a little too arrogant. When he officially inherited the captaincy from Michael Ballack in 2010, many were unhappy with the manner in which he did so.

Since then, though, Lahm has proved time and again that he is the perfect leader for this team. He was quiet but confident, leading his team by example, whether playing at left back, right back or in central midfield.

He has been greeted with overwhelming praise, with compliments from Lukas Podolski, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and even Chancellor Angela Merkel.

'I would like to articulate my huge respect for Philipp Lahm and what he was done for our national team,' said Merkel.

His critics will no doubt see the same old arrogance in his decision to step down now, just days after his finest hour. Bild claimed that Lahm was 'quitting while he is ahead', while TZ mused that he is a 'perfectionist'.

But this decision was not a spontaneous act of vanity. The decision was allegedly made in the autumn of last year, and he informed coach Joachim Low of his plan the morning after the World Cup Final. Wolfgang Niersbach, president of the German FA, said that 'it was clear within minutes of speaking to Phillipp that there was no way I was going to talk him out of it'. Like his football, Lahm's decision was considered and confident.

There are also footballing reasons to step down. The move into midfield is something which has seen less success for Germany than it has for Bayern Munich. At 30, he can no longer make the marauding runs up and down the right that he used to. For the national team, though, he is still more of a right back than a midfielder.

Lahm is leaving the national team as world champions, with no shortage of defensive talent that can be raised to replace him over the next two years. He is also leaving them with a captain. Bastian Schweinsteiger has shown, not least in the World Cup Final, that he can lead this German side as much as anyone, and is almost certain to take over the armband. As Lahm himself said, "I am leaving this team in complete harmony".

Lahm, meanwhile, will continue to play for Bayern at least until his contract runs out in 2018. Pep Guardiola rates him as the finest player he has ever coached, and will certainly not allow him to let up before then.

Germany will survive without Lahm but he will leave a gap. As a leader and a footballer, Lahm was without doubt one of Germany’s finest captains.
