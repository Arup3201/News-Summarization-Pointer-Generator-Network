One of the three pilots on board a helicopter Brian Williams falsely claimed to have been travelling on when it was gunned down Iraq has given his version of the three days he spent with the millionaire NBC news anchor.

Williams, anchor and Managing Editor of the flagship Nightly News show, had been under fire for 11 days after being called out on the overblown story by indignant veterans of the 2003 invasion. 

Bosses at the network finally suspended Williams without pay for six months acted after deciding his own decision to remove himself from anchoring for 'several days' over the 'completely inappropriate' claim was not enough.

Now Army pilot and father of four Allan Kelly, 44, has revealed what really happened on board the Chinook aircraft, saying the aircraft did not come under fire at any time during the completely routine mission and that he and Williams passed the time complaining about their cars.

Truth: Pilot Allan Kelly, 44, (pictured) has revealed what really happened in Iraq, saying the Chinook did not come under fire at any time during the mission and that he and Williams passed the time talking about cars

Suspended: Brian Williams's pay has been stopped for six months during the suspension. The decision was announced by the British president of NBC News, Deborah Turness, right

Kelly said he is reluctant to join those lambasting Williams for his version of events, but told Minnesota's StarTribune that he just wants the truth to be revealed.

'Whatever Brian Williams may or may not be guilty of or what he may or may not have said, that's a reflection on him. It doesn't have anything to do with me... I did my job, and part of my job was to take Brian Williams and his crew on a mission,' he told the newspaper.

Williams' story of being on board a Chinook helicopter during the 2003 Iraq invasion has reportedly changed over the years, but on January 30 he repeated the often-told version about the aircraft being hit by gun and rocket fire and being forced to make an emergency landing.

The pilot, Williams claimed, was later given a Purple Heart - a medal awarded by the U.S. military for those injured or killed while serving. 

Kelly says that at no point did the helicopter take fire and said he was not awarded a Purple Heart.

Instead he says that during the mission a call came over the radio saying a Chinook helicopter that left the base in Kuwait 30 minutes before Kelly's aircraft had been hit by bullets and a rocket-propelled grenade, and that the pilot of that helicopter had landed the aircraft safely.

News of that attack had forced Kelly and another Chinook pilot to turn their aircraft around in the middle of a sandstorm, which took between 15 minutes and half an hour, but he said nobody was hurt - even though the fear of attack and the reduced visibility made it a 'pretty big emotional event'.

Boots on the ground: Williams, pictured above covering Iraq, was pulled up by veterans on an overblown story of being aboard a helicopter hit by an RPG - which it emerged he was not on at all

In danger? Williams also gave a contentious account of his time covering Israel's war with Hezbollah - once claiming there was rocket fire 'just underneath' the helicopter (above) he was riding in - a detail that was notably absent from his reporting at the time

 For the bulk of the mission, Kelly said, Williams and his two NBC colleagues sat around the army's desert camp chatting among themselves and with soldiers.

'We were sitting around talking about cars and I was complaining about the poor service I got at a Saturn dealership,' Kelly said. Williams commented about the poor service he got at a Mercedes-Benz dealership,' he added.

'I realized we're from two different worlds. He's a millionaire and I'm just a grunt,' Kelly said. 'We're not from the same neighborhood.' 

After retelling his Iraq story on January 30, Wiliams was called out on the tall tale by veterans who objected to his glory-grabbing.

Williams issued an on-air apology - and said he had been in a 'following' helicopter.

This detail too came under scrutiny, and it emerged his chopper had been part of a different mission and was around half an hour behind, as Kelly has now confirmed.

Stand-in: Lester Holt, right, will fill the Nightly News anchor's chair while Williams is suspended

In a note sent to NBC staff, Deborah Turness, the president of NBC's news division, described his puffed-up retellings of events from 2003 as 'wrong and completely inappropriate'. 

In the mean time Lester Holt, who has already covered two broadcasts for Williams, will sit in the Nightly News anchor's chair. 

The scandal began on January 30, when Williams repeated an often-told anecdote about being on board a Chinook helicopter during the 2003 Iraq invasion.

He said that he was on board a chopper which got hit by a rocket-propelled grenade and was forced to land. In fact, he was on a completely different helicopter.

After being called out on the tall tale by veterans who objected to his glory-grabbing, Williams issued an on-air apology - and said he had been in a 'following' helicopter.

Dead body? Another Williams anecdote - of seeing a dead body float down a street in New Orleans's French Quarter during Hurricane Katrina, has now also been called into question

His plight worsened after other grand, personal stories - from Hurricane Katrina, Israel's 2006 war with Hezbollah, and even a childhood tale of being mugged - were also called into question.

In her note, Turness wrote: 'We have decided today to suspend Brian Williams as Managing Editor and Anchor of NBC Nightly News for six months.

'The suspension will be without pay and is effective immediately.'

'While on Nightly News on Friday, January 30, 2015, Brian misrepresented events which occurred while he was covering the Iraq War in 2003.

'It then became clear that on other occasions Brian had done the same while telling that story in other venues. This was wrong and completely inappropriate for someone in Brian's position.

'In addition, we have concerns about comments that occurred outside NBC News while Brian was talking about his experiences in the field.

Currently off the air after he admitted to lying about being hit by enemy fire in Iraq, a number of Williams' other seemingly outlandish claims are currently coming under increased scrutiny

Red Bank, New Jersey, 1970s

In a 2011 interview, Brian Williams recalled his time as a teenage volunteer firefighter during which he saved a puppy. However in a 2005 Esquire interview, Williams had claimed to save not one but two puppies.

In the same Esquire interview Williams also revealed that he had been mugged at gunpoint while selling Christmas trees in the sleepy New Jersey town in which he grew up. 

A number of locals have questioned the credibility of his claim that someone 'stuck a .38-caliber in my face'.

Iraq War, 2003

Over the years Williams has told multiple versions of a story about being in an Army Chinook helicopter during the Iraq War in 2003. 

Last month he claimed his helicopter was hit by ground fire, an allegation he was later forced to admit was false after an outcry from soldiers who were present. 

Williams issued an on-air apology and wrote on Facebook: 'Nobody's trying to steal anyone's valor.'

Hurricane Katrina, 2005

Williams has told several stories about his experiences reporting from New Orleans. 

He has claimed to have seen a dead body float past the window of his hotel in the city's French Quarter – even though the area wasn't flooded. 

The accuracy of other Katrina claims, including that he caught dysentery drinking the flood waters and that his hotel was 'overrun' with gangs, have been called into question by others who were on the ground during the disaster. 

Israel, 2006

In a 2007 interview with Fairfield University Student Television, Williams recalled 'Katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter I was riding in' during a trip to Israel. 

In fact he was nowhere near enemy fire and in a broadcast segment filmed that day he described rocket fire 'six miles away'.

Boston, 2006

A Navy vet accused Williams of lying to skip an event honoring members of the Armed Forces so that he could appear on Saturday Night Live.

On the day of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society event the NBC News anchor told organizers that a 'pressing engagement' meant he wouldn't be able speak at the dinner, but later that evening he appeared in a walk-on role on SNL's Weekend Update.
