After 38 games of a long, hard season, the best side always wins the title and Manchester City thoroughly deserve their success. Manuel Pellegrini has done a fantastic job in his first season in English football and he and City should be congratulated.

After the match I was talking to Graeme Souness and we agreed that if we were to have our careers again in the present day then we, and any current young player, would want to join City. That is the club where you want to be.

Man United have dominated English football for so long and though City might not have the history, they have the future.

They have spent big money but they are building now with a manager who has the respect and gratitude of his players and are always looking forward.

With Patrick Vieira working with the youth sides, too, they are clearly trying to copy the Spanish model of having an entire club following one football philosophy.

It has served them well this season, but they will want to make a much better defence of their title than they did after winning it 2011-12. That will not be easy.

Make no mistake, the big clubs are coming for City. United will not want a repeat of this season, Jose Mourinho will be desperate to get Chelsea winning trophies, Arsenal will challenge again and if Liverpool can keep Luis Suarez they will be right up there. If those five are fighting it out at the top, we could be in for another special season.

Happy man: Manuel Pellegrini has done a fantastic job in his first season in charge at Manchester City

Reliable Ramsey

The number of times the lead at the top of the Premier League has changed  hands this season.

Aaron Ramsey gave Arsenal a reminder of what they have been missing with his goal at Norwich on Sunday.

He has taken his game to the next level and I almost picked him in my team of the year. Ramsey was the best player in the league until his injury and that was a real blow for Arsenal because he is a complete midfielder — he can tackle, pass, assist and score. And, as the stats below show, Arsenal were much better off when their Welsh wizard was on the pitch this season.

We could be saying farewell to some good managers this summer but clubs should be careful what they wish for.

West Ham need to be a Premier League club when they move into the Olympic Stadium and though the football wasn’t pretty, Sam Allardyce has done well to keep them up.

At Tottenham, I’m not sure what the future holds for Tim Sherwood but he has done a good job in difficult circumstances. He knows he still has a lot to learn but he has done more than enough to get another good job.

Was this the best season ever?

In terms of the excitement, the goals, the twists and the turns, I don’t think I have seen a better Premier League season. It may not have the same passing or technical quality as the Spanish league, but from top to bottom, nothing beats the pure, raw excitement of the Premier League.

Where else would you find a game and an atmosphere like there was at Selhurst Park on Monday night, or at Anfield when Liverpool beat City? Those two games more than any other this season epitomised everything we love about our league — goals, passion and great drama.

Drama: Luis Suarez was left gutted after Crystal Palace fought back for a 3-3 draw with Liverpool last Monday

That game at Anfield was a personal favourite and was one of the undoubted higlights of the season.Yaya Toure and Luis Suarez had their own personal battle to win goal of the season, but I think Suarez’s flick up and volley against Norwich was the best individual goal while Jack Wilshere’s, also against Norwich, was the best team effort.

It has been magnificent viewing, so let’s hope for more of the same after a great World Cup.

Happier times: Suarez's flick up and volley against Norwich was the best individual goal of the season

Brilliant Barkley

He didn’t quite make it into my team of the season, but there is no doubt about my young player of the year.

Ross Barkley has been superb and I have loved watching him tear through midfields up and down the country.

Talent: Everton's 20-year-old Ross Barkley has been superb throughout the season

He is unique in the English game because we don’t have another young player who can carry the ball so far and at such speed and still look comfortable with both feet.

Let’s hope he gets the World Cup call today that his  performances so richly deserve.

The total gate in the Premier League this season, up 275,902 from last season. United’s home game against Aston Villa at Old Trafford drew the biggest crowd — 75,368.

Sunderland are only the second side  in Premier League history to stay up after being bottom at Christmas. They secured their survival with a win over West Bromwich Albion, who did it in 2004-05.

Martin Skrtel scored his fourth own goal of the season against Newcastle, a new Premier League record. Liverpool and Sunderland were the league’s top own goal scorers this season with six each.

1,052

Goals this season, the lowest Premier League total since 2008-09. Manchester City hit the most with 102, just one shy of Chelsea’s Premier League record, but Norwich scored just 28, the third-worst tally in Premier League history.

64

Manchester United’s 64 points is their lowest total in the Premier League. Their previous worst was 75 in 1996-97 and 2003-04.

31

Mile Jedinak played the first 3,389 minutes of Premier League football for Crystal Palace before being subbed off for the final 31 against Fulham.

1961

This is the first time since 1961 that more than one team have scored 100 top-flight goals.

10

This is the first time 10 managers have left their clubs in a single Premier League season.
