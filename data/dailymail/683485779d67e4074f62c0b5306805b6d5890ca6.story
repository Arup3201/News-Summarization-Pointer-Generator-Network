It's an online community that has helped millions of new mothers connect and share their experiences of coping with a baby.

And among those logging on to Netmums to pick up tips are the most famous new parents in the country – the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

Prince William revealed yesterday that he and wife Kate often turn to the website as he gave OBEs to the  three women who set it up.

Businesswoman Siobhan Freegard said 
she was ‘bowled over’ by the royal seal of approval as she and 
co-founders Cathy Court, 47, and Sally Russell, 46, were rewarded for 
their services to families.

The 46-year-old mother of three said: ‘He said he and Kate used it and so did their friends.

‘He
 said how much it’s needed and how important it is. I talked to him 
about how isolated families feel these days and he gave me a knowing 
nod.

‘I get the feeling 
that they’re just normal parents who sit there Googling things like 
breast feeding issues just like the rest of us.’

Netmums is a network of local community websites where mothers discuss and exchange advice and tips on becoming new parents.

The
 three founders met at a toddler group in their home town of Harrow, 
north west London, and the website went live in 2000.

Just five years 
later there was a local community forum in every part of the UK.

Now it 
is the biggest parenting website in the UK in terms of volume of 
visitors, with a network of 151 local sites and 6.2million unique users 
every month.

Netmums members collectively have more than 2million children and the founders claim they have helped 6million parents.

Each
 founder came from different backgrounds – Mrs Freegard was in 
marketing, Mrs Court worked in food technology and Mrs Russell had a 
background in environmental sciences.

They successfully combined their 
strengths to build a business that Mrs Freegard now estimates as high as
 £50million.

Two years ago, 
the three founders sold the company to European group aufeminin.com, but
 they retain control and continue to work for Netmums.

Buckingham Palace after being named in the New Year’s Honours list

They
 later celebrated their new titles at an afternoon tea party with their 
families. Mrs Freegard said they were ‘privileged and thrilled’ to 
accept the awards, but added: ‘It isn’t for the founders, it’s for the 
Netmums staff and all the Netmums members who provide invaluable support
 making the site what it is.

Mrs
 Russell added: ‘Netmums has created a ‘‘movement’’, giving mums a voice
 at a time in their lives when women often feel disempowered. Because of
 our work post natal depression is no longer a shameful secret but 
something parents talk about openly.’

DJ Pete Tong with his MBE

Superstar club DJ Pete Tong has said he is happy for his name to have become a byword for something gone wrong, as he was awarded an MBE by the Duke of Cambridge.

The Radio 1 presenter was honoured for a career in broadcasting and music that has seen him progress from running a mobile disco to launching a record label and becoming an in-demand producer.

His name has passed into the language as rhyming slang for 'wrong' - with the phrase 'it’s all gone Pete Tong' used to describe a mishap.

After receiving the award from William during a Buckingham Palace investiture ceremony Tong said a fanzine first used the phrase 'as an affectionate slap around the head', but 'it just stuck and turned into an amazing legacy - I’ve never had a problem with it'.

It was also used as the name of a comedy movie where a DJ realises he is becoming deaf.

Tong added: 'The movie obviously was great fun - why run away from something that’s so catchy so I use it as my brand really when I do parties around the world.'

Speaking about his career the DJ said: 'I’ve been standing here for a few hours waiting to do this and still have to pinch myself - I’ve spent my career doing something I love, playing records.

'There are so many worthy people here today, I feel quite humbled by all the servicemen, policemen and the charity workers and people like that. So I count myself lucky to be recognised in this way.'

The 53-year-old, who relocated to Los Angeles from the UK last year supervised the soundtracks for films such as The Beach and 24 Hour Party People and has released a lengthy list of compilations and mix albums.

His musical interest began in his youth as a drummer but he progressed to DJ-ing and after leaving school he started up a mobile disco and then set up his own club night in London as well as booking bands.

Tong’s specialist knowledge helped him to become a music writer on Blues And Soul magazine but after four years he went to work for music label London Records as an A&R man.

After hosting a soul show on a Kent radio station, he went on to land a show on Capital Radio.

Three years later in 1991 he was given a dance show on Radio 1, the Essential Selection which has helped him to become one of the most in-demand club DJs in the UK and with seasons in Ibiza, and he continues to present for the station.

While his radio career was building, Tong continued his record company interests with his own label FFRR releasing music by dance acts such as Utah Saints as well as groups such as Fine Young Cannibals and Hothouse Flowers.
