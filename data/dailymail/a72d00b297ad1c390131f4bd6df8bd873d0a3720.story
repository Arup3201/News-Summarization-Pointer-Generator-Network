Canada's Supreme Court has rejected a challenge by three immigrants to ditch its citizenship oath, which requires would-be citizens to pledge allegiance to Queen Elizabeth II

Canada's Supreme Court has rejected a challenge by three immigrants to ditch its citizenship oath, which requires would-be citizens to pledge allegiance to Queen Elizabeth II.

The appeal was launched by longtime permanent residents Michael McAteer, Simone Topey and Dror Bar-Natan who wanted to become citizens without making the vow to the Queen and royal family.

The trio cited different reasons for not wanting to take the vow, including religious objections.

But Canada's Supreme Court refused to hear the challenge to the citizenship requirement leaving intact an earlier ruling by Ontario Court of Appeal.

Mr McAteer, 81, said he was disappointed but not surprised after learning of the decision.

'It's been a long haul,' said McAteer, a staunch republican who came to Canada from Ireland 51 years ago. 

'(But) I feel the same: If the oath stands, then I won't take Canadian citizenship.' 

Topey, a Jamaican Rastafarian, said her religion forbids taking an oath to the Queen. 

 'I'm trying to become a citizen not a subject,' she outside court, according to Canadian TV news.

Bar-Natan, an Israeli, argued that the oath represents entrenched privilege he opposes. 

The Supreme Court gave no reason for refusing to hear the case. 

Canada's Citizenship Act requires would-be citizens to swear to be 'faithful and bear true allegiance to Queen Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Canada, her heirs and successors.'

Canada is a member of the British Commonwealth and the Queen is the country's honorary head of state.

The federal government had argued that taking the oath has been around since Confederation.

In its ruling last year, the Ontario Court of Appeal noted the Queen remains Canada's head of state, calling the oath a 'symbolic commitment to be governed as a democratic constitutional monarchy unless and until democratically changed.'

Lawyer Peter Rosenthal said the high court refusal to hear the case doesn't necessarily indicate an endorsement of the oath,  but simply means the justices did not feel the case was worthy of their attention.

Australia, which is also part of the commonwealth, scrapped its similar pledge to the monarchy 20 years ago.
