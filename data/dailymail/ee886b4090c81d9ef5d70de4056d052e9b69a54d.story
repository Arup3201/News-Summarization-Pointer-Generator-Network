Hollywood superstar Leonardo DiCaprio has taken over one of the world's largest superyachts in order to watch the World Cup in style.

DiCaprio and more than 20 friends are said to have taken over the 482-foot Topaz, worth £400million, while staying in Brazil for the football tournament.

The yacht is owned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, deputy prime minister of the United Arab Emitates and owner of Manchester City FC.

Ahoy there: Leonardo DiCaprio borrowed superyacht, the Topaz, to ensure his friends get to enjoy the World Cup in style

In the spirit: On Thursday the Basketball Diaries star headed to the kick off game between Brazil and Croatia in San Paulo, Brazil

The Topaz was custom made for billionaire Sheikh Mansour in 2012, and is the the fifth largest superyacht in the world.

The 
imposing yacht was birthed in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on 
Thursday while the Wolf of Wall Street star headed San Paulo to the kick 
off game between Brazil and Croatia.

Seen in the stands wearing a Brazilian scarf around his neck, the 39-year-old actor tried to keep a low profile as he watched the game.

However, it was hard for his yacht to do the same considering its imposing size.

It
 is not clear whether DiCaprio and his friends have borrowed the yacht 
from Sheikh Mansour or if they are renting it off the wealthy Man City 
owner.

The 43-year-old 
Sheikh, part of the royal family of Abu Dhabi, does not exactly need the money, with a personal wealth estimated
 at around £2.9 billion and an estimated family fortune of £90 billion.

Sheikh Mansour, who is the half-brother of the current president of the UAE, has two wives and five children.

It appears Sheikh Mansour and the Hollywood star has been in contact about the vessel in the past, as this is not the first time Leo has thrown a party on the Topaz.

In April this year, Leo teamed up with Jamie Foxx and Orlando Bloom to host an 80s themed party on the Topaz in New York.

According to the New York Daily News,  the 100 guests and over 80 crew members were 'sworn to secrecy' before the party started.

It has not been confirmed whether the Sheikh is joining Leo and his friends in Brazil for the World Cup.

Whoever is paying, if Leo or his guests tire of the football there is plenty for them to do on the Topaz.

Lots to do: Leo and his 20 friends can make the most of the amenities which includes a deck top jacuzzi, a swimming pool, fitness hall, cinema and large conference room

Topaz is understood to have been the work of British designer Tim Heywood, who has played a major role in producing some of the world's finest yachts.

The stunning vessel features a deck top jacuzzi, a swimming pool, fitness hall, cinema and large conference room.

And if getting to the games is a problem, the yacht also has not one, but two helicopter landing pad.

Despite
 it being a film about immense wealth, not even DiCaprio's character on 
Wolf of Wall Street had a vessel quite like the Topaz.

Leo's character Jordan Belfort lounges on the 'small' 145ft Lady M, a yacht available for hire for a breezy £74,000 a week.
