Sales of homes worth £1million or more have soared to a record high, with more sold in one English town than the whole of Scotland.

There were 6,143 £1million-plus house sales in Britain in the first half of 2014 – an incredible 33 a day or more than one an hour.

It is a huge increase on five years ago when there were 1,382 in the first half of 2009.

More £1million-plus homes were sold in St Albans, Hertfordshire (pictured) in the first half of this year than in the whole of Scotland, figures show

Seven out of 10 of the recent seven-figure deals were in London while another 16 per cent were in the affluent South East of England, according to the figures published today.

Some 66 £1million-plus homes exchanged hands in St Albans in Hertfordshire in the first half of 2014 compared with 43 in the whole of Scotland.

The report from Lloyds Bank shows there were 46 per cent more homes sold for at least £1million in the first half of 2014 than in the same period last year.

There were 772 houses sold for £1million or more in Kensington and Chelsea in the half-year and another 633 in Westminster.

In contrast, there were seven sold in Wales, 15 in the North East, 21 in Yorkshire and The Humber, 36 in the East Midlands and 43 in Scotland.

Outside southern England, Cheshire East – which includes the market towns of Nantwich, Knutsford and Sandbach – and Edinburgh were hotspots, with 31 and 20 £1million-plus sales respectively.

Sarah Deaves, director of private banking at Lloyds, said: ‘Property values in prime locations have been boosted by growing demand from wealthy, and often cash-rich buyers from the UK and overseas, as well as limited supply of such properties.

‘Although demand has grown across all regions of Britain in 2014, the greatest concentration is in London, particularly the boroughs of Kensington and Chelsea and Westminster.’ 

There were 6,143 £1million-plus house sales in Britain in the first half of 2014, compared with the first half of 2009 when it was 1,382 

It marks a stunning turnaround from the depths of the financial crisis and recession.

The number of million pound house sales slumped to 1,382 in the first half of 2009 – the lowest point in the past decade. 

But there are signs that the housing market is cooling, however. A report by Nationwide yesterday showed the average house price in the UK rose by 0.5 per cent in October to £189,333.

The annual rate of house price inflation fell for a second month running, from 9.4 per cent in September to 9 per cent in October.

But there are signs that the housing market is cooling, according to Nationwide

The report came a day after figures from the Bank of England showed mortgage lending has tumbled to its lowest level for 14 months and is down 20 per cent since January. 

‘The annual pace of house price growth continued to moderate in October,’ said a Nationwide spokesman. ‘The market has lost momentum. Activity may soften further in the near term, especially in London.’

Meanwhile, the number of house-hunters in the UK has hit a 10-year high as people rush to take advantage of the ‘mortgage war’ between lenders, new figures show.

Rock-bottom interest rates on mortgages has sparked a stampede of buyers hoping to buy a home before the offers disappear, according to The National Association of Estate Agents.

Estate agents reported that an average of 406 house hunters had visited their branches in September – the highest monthly record since October 2004, when it hit 511 prospective buyers.

It follows a campaign by lenders to attract business, with many slashing rates in recent weeks.

HSBC cut its cheapest deal to a record low of 0.99 per cent this month, while rivals including Leeds Building Society, Halifax and Nationwide also cut their rates.

Banks and building societies had raised their rates over the summer in anticipation that interest rates were about to rise.

But the Bank of England indicated more recently that subdued wage growth meant it was unlikely the base rate would rise from its historic low of 0.5 per cent before the general election in May.

Lenders responded by slashing their mortgage rates in a bid to attract customers and return to business as usual after months of financial uncertainty.

A separate report yesterday suggested that tougher mortgage lending rules could be deterring those on smaller salaries from stepping on to the property ladder.

According to new data, the average combined salary of people searching for mortgages on price comparison and broker sites has risen by £10,000 in a year to £56,000.

The Mortgage Advice Bureau, a broker which collate 250,000 monthly online searches, the average combined salary of applicants was up by a fifth on the year, rising from £46,905 to £56,559 between July and September 2014.

As prices continue to rise, getting the right mortgage is essential to making sure buying a home is as affordable as possible.

There are hundreds, if not thousands, of options out there, so, as well as doing your own research, this is an occasion to search out expert opinion from a good mortgage broker.
