More embarrassing details about Sony are coming to light a week after a group with ties to North Korea hacked the production company's internal servers and released hundreds of documents ranging from never-released movies to employee evaluations.

Hidden among the documents never meant to be seen by the public include the budget for upcoming film The Interview, starring Seth Rogen and James Franco as a TV producer and talk show host recruited by the CIA to assassinate North Korean President Kim Jong-un.

The leaked records show Rogen, who also directed and wrote the script, was paid $8.4million for the film, compared to co-star James Franco who made $6.5million.  The budget also revealed a pretty important plot point: that Britney Spears' ex-husband Kevin Federline makes a cameo, for which he was paid $5,000.

Compared to A-list actors like Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert Downey Jr and Jennifer Lawrence, who can take home more than $20million per film, the salaries revealed in the hack show the Rogen and Franco took home relatively average to low pay. Overall the film cost $44million for Sony to make.

Meanwhile, Michael Lynton, the CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment and Amy Pascal, the co-chairman of the company were both revealed to be making a $3million annual salary. 

Among the more entertaining details revealed in the budget were how much the production company paid for small items like props.

One part of the script calls for a 'table of weed, coke, pills and panties' which was budgeted at $250. Thanks to some thrifty production assistants, the cost was brought down to $241. 

The hackers also uploaded five yet-to-be-released films to file-sharing websites, including the Brad Pitt film Fury, still in theaters, and Annie, the much-anticipated remake set for a December 19 release. The company has been trying to take the videos off the internet with cease-and-desist orders. 

Pay information for more than 31,000 employees at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Ltd, a financial firm hired by Sony, were taken in the hack as well. The pay information from 2005 revealed that there are far more men than women with high-paying salaries.

The list was leaked to a reporter at news and pop culture site Fusion. 

Kevin Roose, reporting for Fusion, who was sent a link to the data by an anonymous source, said: 'When I sorted the list by 'annual rate,' I noticed something notable: a stark homogeneity among the people earning the most.

'Based on the spreadsheet ... the employees of Sony Pictures with the highest annual rates appear to be nearly entirely white men.' 

Buzzfeed reviewed almost 40GB of leaked internal data and reported it included 'employee criminal background checks, salary negotiations, and doctors' letters explaining the medical rationale for leaves of absence.'

It reported the files also included a script for an unreleased pilot written by Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan as well as 'email exchanges with employees regarding specific medical treatments they are undergoing, while one disciplinary letter details a manager's romantic relationship and business travel history with a subordinate.' 

The leaked information even includes an email about the breastfeeding diet of a senior executive.

One aspect of the leak, which probably has the Sony IT team reeling, is the several spreadsheet and text documents where employees stored their passwords...under the name 'password'.

And then there's the hilarious slideshow written by Sony CFO David Hendler, negatively reviewing the company's own films.

In one slide, he draws attention to the movies the company put out in 2005, the worst year in the company's history. Those films include Zorro, Bewitched and Zathura.

Hendler follows that up with a slide about the movies distributed in 2010 like Burlesque, How Do You Know and Just Go With It, commenting: 'Not as bad as 2005, but still not something to write home about'.

Those on Sony's marketing teams devised equally entertaining slides, revealed in the breach.

A few of the slides take different movies, and explain the concept, and strengths and weaknesses to highlight.

For movies with a patriotic element, like White House Down and Captain Phillips, executives warn to 'avoid American-centrism' and focus instead on special effects and star actors.

The hack is thought to be carried out by those allied with the North Korean regime, unhappy with the country's portrayal in the film. 

In June, a North Korean official appeared on the state-run news station to say the country would pursue 'a strong and merciless countermeasure' if Sony released the film. 

Despite the threat, Sony has continued to roll out promotion for the movie ahead of it's December 25 release date.  

Exactly one month before it was set to be released, Sony confirmed that the company had been hacked, and that the mysterious group behind the cyber attack released hundreds of company documents online. The day before, an alleged warning posted to Reddit read: 'This is just the beginning'.  

Sony has yet to officially name North Korea as the source of the cyber attack, but sources close to the internal investigation spoke out on Wednesday to say they believe a group known as DarkSeoul is to blame.

The group associated with North Korea was thought to be behind the large-scale March 2013 attack on South Korean banks and broadcasters. 

Other evidence from the hack points to the regime, including Korean-language coding, in similarities to other attacks by DarkSeoul.

The results of the internal investigation into the attack, currently being carried out by FireEye's Mandiant forensics unit, are expected to be announced later this week.

Earlier this week, a North Korean spokesperson refused to deny claims that it was behind the move and would only say 'wait and see' when asked if Pyongyang was involved.

Staff at Sony are growing increasingly disgruntled about the never-ending slew of Adam Sandler movies the company is producing

Staff at Sony are growing increasingly disgruntled about the never-ending slew of Adam Sandler movies the company is producing, according to information released following last week’s cyber attack.

An un-encrypted text file titled ‘Sony_2012_Comments’ has been released which features a long list of negative employee feedback – and Sandler’s name is a reoccurring theme.

The comedian’s company, Happy Madison Productions, has been responsible for 25 films released by Sony over the past 15 years including Click, I Now Pronounce You Chuck And Larry, You Don’t Mess With The Zohan, Grown Ups and 50 First Dates.

These movies turn a profit but are shown little love from the critics and from Sony staff it would appear. Here are some of the comments featured in the leaked document:  

Other criticism from staff was equally as cutting even if the target wasn't quite so specific: 

Sandler movies such as I Now Pronounce You Chuck And Larry regularly turn a profit for Sony but rarely win over the critics or staff a leaked memo has revealed

'The hostile forces are relating everything to the DPRK (North Korea). I kindly advise you to just wait and see,' a spokesman for North Korea's U.N. mission. 

North Korea routinely refers to the United States and South Korea as hostile forces. 

The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation is also investigating the incident. 

North Korea complained to the United Nations in June about The Interview, accusing the United States of sponsoring terrorism and committing an act of war by allowing production of the movie. 

The Pyongyang government denounced the film as 'undisguised sponsoring of terrorism, as well as an act of war' in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.

'I personally don't care if (the movie's) disrespectful to Kim because he's evil. But that's not the intent,' tweeted Rogen on Sunday.

'North Korea has produced tons of propaganda films that portray America's destruction.'   

But cybersecurity expert Hemanshu Nigam has told the Hollywood Reporter that he finds it hard to believe that North Korea is the perpetrator and instead thinks it is more probable that it was the actions of an employee or ex-employee with administrative access privileges.

For the studio - which has laid off hundreds of employees over the past year in an effort to contain costs - the possibility of a disgruntled employee wreaking havoc is very real.

'If terabytes of data left the Sony networks, their network detection systems would have noticed easily,' said Nigam.

'It would also take months for a hacker to figure out the topography of the Sony networks to know where critical assets are stored and to have access to the decryption keys needed to open up the screeners that have been leaked.' 

Scary: Sony workers saw a message appear on computer screens saying 'Hacked by #GOP' - understood to be the initials of a group called Guardians of Peace which has been linked to North Korea

In addition, he said, 'It is possible that North Korean-sponsored hackers were working with someone on the inside. But it is more likely a ruse to shift blame, knowing the distaste the North Korean regime has for Sony Pictures.'

Sony Pictures' computer system went down last Monday after the cyber attack.

Before
screens went dark, they displayed a red skull and the phrase
'Hacked By #GOP,' which reportedly stands for Guardians of
Peace.

The hackers also warned they
would release 'secrets' stolen from Sony.

The data released so far from the apparently leaked documents has already been damaging - it revealed all the top executives at Sony Pictures Entertainment are white and male, raising questions about control of Hollywood's film output.
