A disgusted father was horrified to find maggots wriggling around in a steak and kidney pie when he opened it to cook for his children.

Stuart Pay, 39, had opened the oven to cook the Fray Bentos pie when he noticed chunks of its pastry were missing. 

After taking a closer look, the electrician from Evesham, Worcester, saw three tiny maggots swimming around in the £2.49 pie. 

Stuart Pay was horrified to discover three maggots swimming in the Fray and Bentos steak and kidney pie he was about to cook for his children

The electrician was about to give the pie to children Cody, four, Kurtis, 12, and Jade, 14 when he noticed the maggots wriggling around

The father of three said he was 'disgusted' by the discovery but was glad to have made it before feeding children Cody, four, Kurtis, 12, and Jade, 14. 

'We were about to put it in the oven but then we noticed there was a bit of pastry missing and then we saw the maggots,' he said. 

'We were going absolutely mad. We were disgusted. 

'I will never buy them again. I will never buy a pie out of a tin again.

'It is disgusting. It could have made my kids ill because at the start I just thought some of the pastry casing was missing but then I looked further.

'So the maggots must have eaten it away. It is very gross. I only bought the pie days before. It is really horrible.' 

The 39-year-old said he fears the maggots may have landed up in the pie after flies laid eggs in its case in the factory. Baxters, who produces the product, has not commented

Mr Pay said he would never buy another pie from the company again after the 'disgusting' discovery

Mr Pay added he thought the maggots may have wormed their way into the pie when it was being made in a factory.  

'We think there may have been flies in the factory and they may have laid their eggs in the containers there,' he added. 

The family bought the pie from their local branch of Iceland just days beforehand. 

Mrs Pay said the store was however not at fault and that the responsibility lies with Baxters. 

'I don't think the store are at fault at all. They cannot see what is inside the pies.' 

A spokesman for Fray Bentos said: 'We have been informed of the claims made by Mr & Mrs Pay regarding one of our Fray Bentos products and are treating their complaint as a priority.'

'Our immediate request on being contacted was to ask for the product to be returned so we could instigate an internal investigation into the can and its contents. 

'As of yet we have not received the product therefore it is impossible for us to speculate further on these claims.'
