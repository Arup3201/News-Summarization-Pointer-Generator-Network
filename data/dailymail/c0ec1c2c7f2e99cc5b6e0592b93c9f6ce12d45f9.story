A four-year-old New Jersey preschooler was infected with Enterovirus D-68 at the time the child died last week, the United States Center for Disease Control confirmed Friday night.

The respiratory illness - which carries symptoms such as cough, runny nose, sneezing and body aches - has already been confirmed in seven children in the state and 514 children across the country.

Earlier this week, the CDC said that four patients confirmed to have contracted Enterovirus D-68 had died, but it was not known what role the virus had played in their deaths.

Emily Otrando, a 10-year-old from Cumberland, Rhode Island, died September 22 at Hasbro Children's Hospital.

Widespread:  
From mid-August to October 3, 2014, CDC or state public health laboratories have confirmed a total of 538 people in 43 states and the District of Columbia with respiratory illness caused by EV-D68

Scene: On September 25, a four-year-old from New Jersey who attended preschool at Yardville Elementary School died. The CDC confirmed Friday night the toddler tested positive to Enterovirus following the death

Tragic: Emily Otrando, a 10-year-old from Cumberland, Rhode Island, died September 22 at Hasbro Children's Hospital. She was infected with EV-D68, but died from a bacterial infection that hit her in tandem with the virus

The CDC said Friday night the New Jersey toddler, who attended Yardville Elementary School in Hamilton, died at home on Thursday September 25.

'Our thoughts remain with the family at this very difficult time,' said Health Commissioner Mary E. O’Dowd, according to NJ.com.

'While the child has tested positive for EV-D68, the cause of death has not yet been determined and it is unclear if EV-D68 played a direct role or was a contributing factor in his death.'

The child has not been identified.

The virus was also found in three other patients who died in September, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC declined to release any other details about those deaths.

The Rhode Island child's death was the result of a bacterial infection, Staphylococcus aureus, that hit the girl in tandem with the virus, Rhode Island officials said in a statement.

They called it 'a very rare combination', and stressed that most people who catch the virus experience little more than a runny nose and low-grade fever.

The child was in good health before she developed severe breathing problems and her parents called 911, said Dr. Michael Fine, director of the Rhode Island Department of Health.

Warning: Children's Hospital Colorado pediatric neurologist Teri Schreiner, MD, speaks during a press conference at the hospital September 30 to update the media on the condition of 10 patients with EV-D68

Recovering: Melissa Lewis, of Denver, helps her son, Jayden Broadway, 9, as he coughs in his bed at the Children's Hospital Colorado in Aurora, Colo. He was treated for the enterovirus 68 and released

She was taken by ambulance to a Providence hospital, where she died.

'Very quickly after they got to the hospital, things became dire,' Fine said at a news conference.

This enterovirus germ is not new.

It was first identified in 1962 and has caused clusters of illness before. 

Because it's not routinely tested for, it may have spread widely in previous years without being identified in people who just seemed to have a cold.

This year, the virus has gotten more attention because it has been linked to hundreds of severe illnesses. 

Beginning last month, hospitals in Kansas City, Missouri, and Chicago have received a flood of children with trouble breathing. 

Some needed oxygen or more extreme care such as a breathing machine. Many, but not all, had asthma before the infection.

Germ: Enterovirus EV-D68 is uncommon but not new and causes prominent respiratory symptoms, like a cold but worse. There's no vaccine for EV-D68

Sick: 13-year-old Will Cornejo is recovering at Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children at Presbyterian/St. Luke's Medical Center in Denver on September 5 from human enterovirus 68 that has come to Colorado

Health officials say they have not detected a recent mutation or other change in the virus that would cause it to become more dangerous.

The government says enterovirus 68 has sickenedover 500 people in 42 states and the District of Columbia.

Almost all have been children.

Health officials are also investigating whether the virus played a role in a cluster of 10 Denver-area children who have suffered muscle weakness and paralysis.
