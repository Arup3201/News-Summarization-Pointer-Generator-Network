The wife of Chinese politician Bo Xilai has agreed to be defended by government-appointed lawyers after being accused of murdering British businessman Neil Heywood.

Gu Kailai, 53, known as the Jackie Kennedy of China, and an aide were charged last week with poisoning Neil Heywood, 41, in November.

Ms Gu’s decision to accept two government lawyers rather than use her own private attorneys suggests there are behind-the-scenes negotiations taking place between her and the Chinese Politburo, said one expert.

The state-run news agency Xinhua said Mrs Gu and a family aide, Zhang Xiaojun, were both charged with poisoning Mr Heywood.

The charge marks a dramatic fall from grace for Mrs Gu, the daughter of a Mao-era revolutionary hero.

The lawyers are based in the Anhui province, where the trial will take place.

It is 700 miles east of Chongqing, 
where Mr Heywood was found dead in a hotel room and where Ms Gu’s 
husband was the Communist Party boss.

Mr Bo was removed from the Communist Party after his wife was arrested in April. He is now under house arrest.

Mr Heywood, who lived in Beijing with 
his Chinese wife and two children, was summoned to Chongqing for a 
meeting last November and was found dead a day later.

It has been alleged he was murdered after he threatened Ms Gu’s son Bo Guagua, 24, in a dispute over money.

State media said Mrs Gu and her son had ‘conflicts with Mr Heywood over economic interests’ and that Mrs Gu was worried about a ‘threat to her son’s personal security’.

There have also been reports Mr 
Heywood helped Ms Gu smuggle money out of China, and that she funnelled 
up to £3.8 billion to overseas accounts.

Mr Heywood also helped Bo Guagua get a
place at top British public school Harrow. He then went on to study at 
Oxford and Harvard.

There is speculation the money Ms Gu 
allegedly smuggled out of China funded her son’s £60,000- a-year Harvard
education and extravagant lifestyle.
