The U.S. Air Force is sending 12 of its 'tankbuster' jets back Europe as part of the response to Russia's intervention in Ukraine.

The European command revealed the group of A-10s will be deployed as part of Operation Atlantic Resolve which was set up last year after Putin's troops annexed Crimea.

They will be stationed at Spangdahlem air base in Germany along with 300 airman so they can be called to action by Eastern European allies at short notice.

Senior officials said the unit were being sent to reassure allies their commitment to European security is still a 'priority' following months of tension in the region.

Increasing presence: The U.S. Air Force is sending 12 A-10, also known as 'tankbuster' jets, back Europe as part of the response to Russia's intervention in Ukraine

According to Stars and Stripes, they will remain in Europe for around six months before another rotation. 

Designed in the 1970s, the aircraft also known as a Warthog was developed to support ground troops against the armored tanks of the Soviet Union. 

They can carry a range of bombs and missiles and are fitted with seven-barrel 30 mm Gatling gun that can fire almost 4,000 rounds per minute - enough to blow up a tank. 

A 'bathtub' titanium shell also protects the pilot from any ground fire.  

Tom Jones, vice commander, United States Air Forces in Europe - Air Forces Africa (USAFE), said in a statement: 'The Air Force is increasing rotational presence in Europe to reassure our allies and partner nations that our commitment to European security is a priority.'

A release on the USAFE website read: 'The A-10s are being deployed as part of a Theater Security Package in support of Operation Atlantic Resolve. 

'While deployed they will conduct training alongside our NATO allies to strengthen interoperability and to demonstrate U.S. commitment to the security and stability of Europe. The A-10s and Airmen are deploying from the 355th Fighter Wing, Davis-Monthan AFB, Ariz.'

Despite the movment of the A-10s, they are set to be retired by the forces in 2019 and replaced by the F-35s as the main ground support fighter jets.

The government has spent nearly $400billion on the updated models. They are also being purchased by NATO allies including the UK, Italy, Australia, Canada and Turkey. 

Gen. Mark Welsh, the Air Force chief of staff told CNN in January: 'It's not about not liking or not wanting the A-10. It's about some very tough decisions that we have to make to recapitalize an Air Force for the threat 10 years from now.' 

Last year they were forced to ground a whole fleet of the 97 Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 fighter jets to allow for further inspections of the engines following a fire. 

It is the ugliest aircraft in the Air Force's arsenal.

The A-10, often called a warthog, was designed to destroy Soviet tanks and troops on the ground.

Officially the Thunderbolt II, it was quickly nicknamed the Warthog for its unusual looks,

It was specifically designed around its main weapon, a 30mm cannon which fires 4,000 rounds a minute.

The plane can fly low and slow, coming down to 50ft to shoot at or drop bombs on enemy positions.

Its top speed is just above 400mph but it can go as slow as 150mph and 'loiter' for hours above targets making it an effective deterrent as well as an attack plane.

The Warthog is covered in 1,200lbs of titanium armor, making it invulnerable to attack from anything but heavy weapons.

Even when hit it is designed to fly home on one engine, with no tailfin and half a wing missing.

On board the single-seater the pilot has at his controls the cannon, which is accurate to 4,000ft, and fires depleted-uranium shells, as well as Maverick air-to-surface missiles, 500lb free fall bombs, and Hydra air-launched rockets.

Despite USAF attempts to retire the fleet, it is expected to remain in service into the 2020s. At one stage when the Air Force suggested retiring its more than 300 A-10s the Army indicated it would take them over as soldiers are so keen on its close support capabilities.
