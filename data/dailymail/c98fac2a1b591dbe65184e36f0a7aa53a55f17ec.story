Under stress: Authorities say Paul Gilkey snapped under the pressure of caring for his ill wife

A convicted murderer gunned down three members of his family before killing himself after an argument about what to feed his terminally-ill wife, police say.

Paul Gilkey, 63, snapped while looking after his wife Darlene, 59, who is dying of cancer. Authorities say he wasn't getting along with his son Leroy or wife's two sisters Barbara S. Mohler and Dorothy M. Cherry, who had come over to help Darlene.

An argument broke out in the small Logan, Ohio, home after Darlene's sisters fed her tea and toast after Gilkey had peeled an orange for her.

Three hours after the fight began, 
Gilkey walked out of the living room, where his wife was staying in a 
hospital bed, and returned with a 9mm Browning handgun.

Authorities say he shot dead Ms Mohler, 70, and Ms Cherry, 63. He also killed his son, Leroy Gilkey, 38, a beloved high school science teacher.

During his rampage, Paul Gilkey told his step-son, Ralph E. Sowers III, 36, to leave.

Mr Sowers told police his life was spared because he has children.

All the while, bedridden Darlene Gilkey watched, unable to stop the violence.

Gilkey then shot himself in the chest on the front porch, according to authorities. 

According to The Columbus Dispatch, Gilkey was convicted of murder in 1974 in Athens County when he beat a 
man to death with a fence post. He was released from prison in 1988.

Details about that crime were not immediately available.

After he fled the home, Mr Sowers called 911 and described the horrific crime in an hour-long phone call with dispatchers

First, Ms Mohler was killed by two close-range gunshots to the head.

'He tried to shoot my brother, and my 
brother was hiding behind me. And then he kept telling me to "Duck! 
Duck! Duck!"' Mr Sowers sobbed.

Then, he said, Gilkey 'walked up to me and 
held the gun over my head and squeezed the trigger, and my brother went 
down on the ground,' the survivor reported.

Leroy died from three close-range shots to the head and was also wounded in the hand.

'And then he walked over to my aunt 
and shot her,' Mr Sowers said.

Ms Cherry, the final victim, was killed by a gunshot wound to the chest and a close-range shot to the head.

Mr Sowers, 36, fled the house and drove up the road seeking a cellphone signal to call for help.

'He let me leave because I have kids,' he says on the 911 call.

A cousin of Paul Gilkey said Gilkey was upset about other family members being in the house.

'They — the two sisters and his son — were staying out there, and he said he couldn't spend any time with her,' said Matthew Henderson, 45.

Mr Henderson said his own wife happened to call the home immediately after the shooting and spoke with Darlene Gilkey, who said that her 63-year-old husband 'shot everybody' and then went outside.

'I said, "What's he doing?" (She said) "I think he's waiting on more people to come so he could kill them,"' Mr Henderson recounted.

The wife didn't say why she'd been spared, Mr Henderson said.

'I think he thought if he would kill her he would go to hell,' he said.

Mr Henderson said his cousin had recently bought two or three plots at a cemetery, though it didn't seem unusual for a man whose wife had terminal cancer. He described Gilkey as unpredictable and unstable and said that he might have taken some pills and been drinking before the shooting.

'I thought what would happen is that he would wait until she passed away and then he would shoot himself,' he said.

'I didn't think he would shoot other people, I thought he would take his own life.'
