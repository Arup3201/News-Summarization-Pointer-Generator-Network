She made headlines when she became the first female model signed exclusively to pose in menswear and now Casey Legler is to star in a series of photos commissioned by British high street brand, AllSaints.

The 6'2" former Olympic swimmer and photographer stars in the high street brand's new Portraits of a Collection series, which will run exclusively on the AllSaints website.

Designed to highlight some of the world's coolest up-and-coming creatives - as well as the AllSaints spring/summer collection of course - the photos also feature British artist Barry Reigate and Sonja Kinski, daughter of German actress Nastassja Kinski.

Androgynous: Former Olympic swimmer, Casey Legler, is the world's only female male model

French-born Legler, 35, was signed up by the men's division of New York-based Ford Models last summer.

The AllSaints images show Leger on typically androgynous form and staring moodily away from the camera, her hair styled into a trendy quiff.

Speaking about the model, AllSaints creative director, Will Beedle, said: 'AllSaints has always been about creativity and will always have an affinity with youngÂ  directional creatives.'

Although the AllSaints photo series is designed to showcase the brand's latest collection, it is part of an ongoing project which aims to provide up-and-coming creatives with a platform for their work.'

Also involved in the series are New York photographer, Bon Duke, 24, and model, Hollie May Saker, 18, plus tattooist, skateboarder and model, Vinnie Woolston, 26.

'We felt it was the right time to 
document the collection in a way that celebrated the culture of 
creativity that is at the brand's core,' Beedle told Glamour magazine.

'The Portraits will expand beyond the stills with a series of creative projects that lead into design, film and art.'

Legler, whose career to date has also included shoots for Time and Muse magazines in the USA, remains sanguine about her unusual life as the world's first female male model.

'As far as I know, there are no other 
women exclusively modelling as male models,' she revealed in an 
interview with Time magazine.

'That sounds... That's such a weird thing to say! Cause I'm a woman, you know!'

'Is it a stretch for me to get styled
 wearing men's clothes?' she continued. 'Anyone can look at me for two 
seconds and know that that part is not so complicated.

'I think the part that can feel 
complicated sometimes is that I also look really fierce in a dress, and 
I've been taught by the best queens how to rock some heels!'

Talking about Andrej Pejic, the Bosnian-born, Australian-raised male model who has made a name for himself in the world of womenswear, she said:

'Andrej is gorgeous. In many ways, I come ushered in by that.

'What I wish is that we all get to be exactly who we are. And sometimes that's complicated,' she explains.

'We have very specific ways in which we identify ourselves as man or woman and I think that sometimes those can be limiting ...

'Seeing me on the men's board ... speaks to the notion of freedom, you know. There's something really bold about that, and that it really is saying look, there is also this other way, and it's really rad.'

Not just a pretty face: Up-and-coming director, Sean Frank, will be producing fashion films for AllSaints as part of the project
