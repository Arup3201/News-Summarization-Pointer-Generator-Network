If history and a tilt at the career grand slam at the Masters seems a world away for Rory McIlroy amidst the water torture of Doral, then this is the week when it will all come into blessed focus.

Forget the frustrated figure he cut on Friday when he created a YouTube highlight with his highland toss of his three iron into one of the many hazards that give the Blue Monster its name.

This week it will all feel like stale news when he makes the ultimate golfing road trip. How does a couple of days behind closed doors at Augusta sound, with your dad for company, a couple of mates, a club member who knows all the course secrets and an athlete who is even more celebrated in America than the world No1?

McIlroy plans to link up with four-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady at Augusta

All that awaits the 25-year-old as he combines a bit of rest and recreation with a touch of sharp prep work with the first major of the season now just a month away.

‘To be honest, Augusta National is probably even nicer without the crowds than it is during the Masters, so it’s going to be a great experience,’ he said.

The much-decorated athlete? None other than Tom Brady, quarterback with the New England Patriots and a four-time Super Bowl champion. He has played Augusta once before and shot a 77, so he is clearly no mean competitor.

For a massive fan of virtually every sport like McIlroy, the appeal of linking up with Brady is obvious.

As for the club member, Jeff Knox accompanied McIlroy when he was first man out in the third round of the Masters last year. Acting as marker, the 52 year old actually outscored him shooting 70 to McIlroy’s 71, with the latter describing Knox’s performance on the greens as ‘the best I have ever seen at Augusta’.

It is not rocket science, therefore, as to why McIlroy would seek him out in a more friendly setting in an attempt to pick his brain. At the season’s first major, McIlroy will be attempting to complete not only the career grand slam but a third major victory in a row, following his successes in The Open and the USPGA last year.

As for Doral and the WGC-Cadillac Championship, McIlroy began his third round yesterday eight shots adrift of the leader JB Holmes. He actually made up three strokes on Holmes on Friday despite his three iron following his golf ball into the water at the par-five eighth.

McIlroy played a lot better once he had let off steam, with the result that there were only nine players ahead of him at the halfway stage. Among them were some powerful hitters, including Dustin Johnson, Henrik Stenson and Bubba Watson. Welshman Jamie Donaldson was ninth.

Australian Adam Scott turned in a remarkable opening two rounds to be just three off the lead.

The Australian was not only playing his first tournament for three months, he was using a standard-length putter for the first time in four years.
