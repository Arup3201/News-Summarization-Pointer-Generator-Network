A hungry  bear found himself in a sticky situation after he let his greediness get the better of him.

In the hilarious video taken by a German tourist, the dopey animal gets stuck in a gap between rocks while fishing for food in Anan Creek, Alaska.

The large black bear was trying to make his way to higher ground when he slipped into the crevice and found himself unable to wriggle free.

But unperturbed by the situation, the bear decided to continue fishing from the restricted spot.

The amusing footage was captured by the tourist while he was on a tour around the region with his family late last month.

He said that the bear eventually found his way out of the hole.

Hungry: In his quest for food the dopey bear attempts to clamber to higher ground but finds himself sliding down into a space between two rocks above the stream

Trapped: The animal finds himself stuck in the crevice and starts trying to free himself by wriggling his body

Going... Looking a little bemused bemused by his plight, the animal slips down further into the moss-lined gap

Going... The bear makes one last valiant attempt to free himself by pulling himself up by his giant paws

Gone! The bear gives up and slides down into the crevice until just his furry snout is visible between the rocks

No problem: The greedy bear appears unperturbed by his situation continues to fish for food by reaching its big paw down between the rocks and dipping it into the water below
