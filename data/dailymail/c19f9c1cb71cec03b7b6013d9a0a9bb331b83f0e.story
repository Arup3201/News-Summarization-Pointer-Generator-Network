A 15-year-old Florida boy has admitted to shooting his mother two years after telling police that she was killed at the hands of an intruder.

During a court hearing Tuesday, investigators said that Jonathan Rowles came clean to them that there was no break-in at his Naples home, and that he was the one who pulled the trigger one Sunday in August of 2010, gunning down his 39-year-old Mother, Kelly Rowles.

'He said, "Yes, it was an accident, and I'm sorry for lying,"' Collier County sheriff's detective David Hurm Sr said during the hearing.

The Sheriff's Department has initially ruled the shooting an accident, but the State Attorney's Office decided to charge Rowles as a juvenile with manslaughter, the Naples Daily News reported.

Police received a call shortly after 9am on August 22, 2010, about a shooting inside a condominium at 9288 Grassy Way in the Fiddler's Creek development.

When officers arrived on the scene 13 minutes later, they found Kelly Ann Rowles dead from a gunshot wound to the head.

During Tuesday's hearing, investigators who responded to the scene of the shooting two years ago described Jonathan Rowles' demeanor at the time as relatively composed.

The 13-year-old boy chatted with police about video games and school, but started to cry when told that his mother was dead.   

‘He was fairly calm, but he kind of looked nervous and upset,’ said Angela Larson, a victim's advocate who tended to Rowles on the scene.

Larson testified that the boy initially said that a bald man wearing black gloves got into their home and shot his mother while he watched TV in another room. But when pressed further, Rowles' story turned vague, raising the officers' suspicions.

‘The information he was providing wasn't consistent with the physical evidence I was seeing on scene,’ Hurm said.

At that point, Rowles admitted to the shooting, Hurm said, but said it was an accident. In September 2010, the 13-year-old turned himself in at the Collier County jail, NBC2 reported at the time.

This week, Rowles' public defender, Justin Barger, was seeking to suppress statements made by his client to investigators after the shooting stemming from allegations of coercion by law enforcement.

However, during the hearing, five Sheriff’s Office employees denied intimidating Rowles during questioning.

Detective Hurm insisted that although he used a stern inflection at one point while interviewing Rowles, he did not yell at the teen. He pointed out that the boy struggled to grasp the meaning of the word 'intentional.'

Hurm also said he went through Miranda rights at length, calling it 'the longest Miranda I've ever been involved with.'

Two years after Kelly Rowles’ shooting, many questions remain unanswered, in part because juvenile records are sealed under Florida law, and in part because law enforcement officials have not been forthcoming with information about the case.

Authorities have not revealed whether the mother and son had a turbulent or good relationship, nor whether Kelly Rowles’ death was international or accidental. It also remains unknown what exactly the boy told officials after the shooting.

At an August hearing, Barger said Rowles has been living with his grandmother and doing well in school.

Rowles' father, 42-year-old Christopher Rowles, was arrested in March and remains jailed on $100,000 bond for allegedly molesting a 14-year-old girl at least a dozen times over a three-year period.

If convicted, Johnathan Rowles would not face any prison time because he is charged as a minor.
