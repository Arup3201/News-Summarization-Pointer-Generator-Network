Militants in Iraq have seized nuclear materials used for scientific research at a university, the United Nations has been warned.

Iraq warned of the seizure in a letter on Wednesday to the U.N. in which it appealed for help to 'stave off the threat of their use by terrorists in Iraq or abroad.'

In the letter, which has been obtained by Reuters, Iraq's U.N. ambassador Mohamed Ali Alhakim said nearly 40kg of uranium compounds were kept at Mosul University.

The city of Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, was captured last month in a seizure led by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIS).

The U.N. atomic agency has today said it believed the nuclear material was 'low grade' and did not pose a significant security risk.

'Terrorist groups have seized control of nuclear material at the sites that came out of the control of the state,' Alhakim told U.N Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, adding that such materials 'can be used in manufacturing weapons of mass destruction.'

'These nuclear materials, despite the limited amounts mentioned, can enable terrorist groups, with the availability of the required expertise, to use it separate or in combination with other materials in its terrorist acts,' said Alhakim.

He warned that they could also be smuggled out of Iraq.

The International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) 'is aware of the notification from Iraq and is in contact to seek
 further details', IAEA spokeswoman Gill Tudor said.

Isis took over swathes of Syria and Iraq before renaming itself the Islamic State on June 29 and declaring its leader caliph - a title held by successors of the Prophet Mohammad.

'On the basis of the initial information we believe the material involved is low grade and would not present a significant safety, security or nuclear proliferation risk,' she said. 'Nevertheless, any loss of regulatory control over nuclear and other radioactive materials is a cause for concern.'

A U.S. government source said the 
materials were not believed to be enriched uranium and therefore would 
be difficult to use to manufacture into a nuclear weapon.

Earlier this week, video footage was published of ISIS militants taking sledgehammers to centuries-old graves in Mosul.

Olli
 Heinonen, a former IAEA chief inspector, said that if the material came
 from a university it could be laboratory chemicals or radiation 
shielding, consisting of natural or depleted uranium.

'You cannot make a nuclear explosive from this amount, but all uranium compounds are poisonous,' Heinonen told Reuters. 'This material is also not "good" enough for a dirty bomb.'

In a so-called 'dirty bomb', conventional explosives are used to disperse radiation from any radioactive source, such as from hospitals and factories which are less well protected.

'These nuclear materials, despite the 
limited amounts mentioned, can enable terrorist groups, with the 
availability of the required expertise, to use it separate or in 
combination with other materials in its terrorist acts'

Citing U.N. investigations dating back 
ten years or more, Heinonen said there should be no enriched uranium in 
Mosul. The Vienna-based IAEA helped dismantle Iraq's clandestine nuclear
 programme in the 1990s - during Heinonen's three decades there.

Any loss or theft of highly enriched uranium, plutonium or other types of radioactive material is potentially serious as militants could try to use them to make a crude nuclear device or a 'dirty bomb', experts say.

Because radioactive material is less hard to find and the device easier to make, experts say a 'dirty bomb' - which could cause panic and have serious economic and environmental consequences - is a more likely threat than an actual atom bomb.

Earlier this week, video footage was published of ISIS militants taking sledgehammers to centuries-old graves in Mosul.

Meanwhile, Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has called on the Islamic State to release 49 people seized from the Turkish consulate in Mosul, before the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

Erdogan appealed to the group during a Ramadan fast-breaking dinner late on Wednesday. Ramadan ends on July 27 in Turkey.

The state-run Anadolu Agency quoted Erdogan as saying: 'If they are true believers they need to release our brothers. That's what we expect.'

The Turks were seized from the consulate on June 11, when the group overran Mosul. They include diplomats, children and special forces police.

Thirty-two Turkish truck drivers also seized in Mosul were released last week.
