Outburst: Education Secretary Michael Gove (pictured on Tuesday) shouted 'you're a disgrace' at those MPs who opposed the Government in the vote

Michael Gove was so furious with Tory MPs for voting down intervention he had to be restrained by colleagues, it was claimed last night.

The Education Secretary, a staunch backer of military action in Syria, shouted 'you're a disgrace' at those MPs who opposed the Government in the tense vote last night.

Scottish National MP Angus Robertson said Mr Gove carried on yelling 'disgrace, disgrace, disgrace' at Tory and Liberal Democrat rebels in stunning scenes in the House of Commons around 11pm last night.

Labour MP Barry Gardiner also told how Mr Gove, a close ally of Prime Minister David Cameron, 'lost it' and accused colleagues of 'supporting (Syrian President Bashar al-) Assad'.

He had to be persuaded to calm down by colleagues.

Mr Gove, speaking about Syria this week, did not join colleagues in calling for MPs to vote on military action, saying he believed the appropriate response should be decided by the Prime Minister.

He said at a speech in London on Tuesday that any action should be predicated 'above all' on the 'horrendous humanitarian atrocities' thought to have been carried out by regime forces.

'I am like everyone, horrified by what we've seen in Syria and like almost everyone anxious that whatever can be done to alleviate the suffering is done', he said.

Dramatic: Mr Gove's outburst came after David Cameron (left) and Labour leader Ed Miliband (right) had spoken

'I think we're lucky that we have in David Cameron and William Hague the right people leading this country and its response to the terrible things that have happened in Syria....

â€˜We all need to be calm but resolute in our response, and I think that's exactly the position and the virtues the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary have shown.

'The decision about the government is going to respond to the horrendous humanitarian atrocities that we have witnessed is one that is properly taken by the Prime Minister and the members of the National Security Council.'
