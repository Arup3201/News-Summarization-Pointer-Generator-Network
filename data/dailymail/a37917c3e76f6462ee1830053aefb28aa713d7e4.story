The International  Monetary Fund yesterday doubled Britain’s growth forecasts for the year in the biggest upgrade for any major economy.

In a huge boost for the Government, the IMF said UK output will increase by 1.4 per cent this year – twice the rate predicted in April when it warned Chancellor George Osborne was ‘playing with fire’ by pressing ahead with his austerity programme.

The forecast was also higher than the 0.9 per cent predicted in July and the IMF expects growth to accelerate to 1.9 per cent in 2014.

Boost: George Osborne will feel vindicated at the IMF upgrading its forecast for UK growth by more than any other developed economy

Its chief economist Olivier Blanchard, who was behind the ‘playing with fire’ claim,  conceded that he was ‘pleasantly surprised’.

Britain’s economy is now the fastest growing among the European members of the G7 group of the world’s richest nations, including France and Germany.

Germany will grow by 0.5 per cent this year and 1.4 per cent next year, and France by just 0.2 per cent in 2013 and one per cent in 2014.

Mr Blanchard said: ‘Six months ago we were worried about growth in the UK coming back. We’ve been pleasantly surprised.’

But in a note of scepticism, he said Britain’s improved performance ‘does not tell us whether fiscal consolidation [austerity] was right or not’.

‘It doesn’t tell us whether growth would have come back earlier with a different fiscal framework. When we see risks, we warn. And if the risks are avoided, all the better,’ he said.

In its World Economic Output report, the IMF noted signs of an improving economy consistent ‘with increasing consumer and business confidence’.

However, it said ‘output remains well below its pre- crisis peak’. Recent figures  suggest Britain’s gross domestic product is still about 3 per cent shy of the peak in 2007.

Meanwhile a poll of members of the Institute of Directors found 75 per cent believe the outlook is now ‘brighter’ than at any time since 2008.

The improved outlook will, however, take some time to be reflected in the jobs market.

The IMF says the unemployment rate will fall from 7.7 per cent this year to 7.5 per cent in 2014. This measure is important because the Bank of England will not consider raising interest rates until it falls to 7 per cent.

The main cloud on the horizon for the British and world economy is the ‘shutdown’ in Washington, the IMF’s chief economist said, while failure to lift the US debt ceiling could lead to ‘potentially major disruptions’ in financial markets.

The Treasury said: ‘The IMF has confirmed the UK economy is turning a corner.’ But it acknowledged ‘the recovery cannot be taken for granted’.

Mr Osborne said: ‘I think the overwhelming majority of people now realise Britain was right to tackle its debts. We can see jobs being created in our economy, but, of course, we’ve still got a long way to go.’
