A gripping blow-by-blow account of the D-Day invasion taken from rolling news bulletins which detailed the action as it unfolded has gone up for sale in New York.

The constant stream of updates were filed hourly as more than 150,000 Allied soldiers stormed the beaches of Normandy in France at dawn on June 6, 1944.

One of the bulletins reveals that during the 
early stages of the attack, with Allied commanders remaining 
tight-lipped, journalists relied on information from German sources for 
their reports.

The Allied invasion of Europe began today between midnight and 2.25am our time. An armada of four thousand ships and thousands of small landing craft invaded the northern French coast between Cherbourg and Caen - aerial pictures show our forces have already hacked their way inland a considerable distance JA glider-borne troops have landed and established offensive pockets. Prime Minister Churchill said - So far the commanders who are engaged report that everything is proceeding according to plan -- and what a plan -

The short bulletins were transmitted via telex and printed on ticker tape in an age before live news broadcasts, e-mail and Twitter.

They were then sent to newsrooms across the U.S. over the Dow Jones financial newswire throughout the invasion.

A steady flow of reports on the D-Day raids, collated from reporters, press agencies and official sources, were sent out on the service, interrupting its normal information on global stock markets.

Ticker tape was usually thrown away once it had been used but a 13ft roll carrying 12 hours of updates somehow survived.

It is the only one of its kind known to exist.

The first dispatch, setting the scene of the invasion, codenamed Operation Overlord, read: 'The Allied invasion of Europe began today between midnight and 2.25am our time.

After recounting initial invasion successes to Commons Prime Minister Churchill said - All of this of course although very valuable is a first and vitally essential step but gives no indication whatever of what may be the course of the battle in the next few days or weeks because the enemy will now probably endeavor to concentrate in this area -

A German news agency broadcast acknowledged today that Allied tanks had penetrated several kilometers between the towns of Caen and Isigny on the Normandy Peninsula --- The Paris radio broadcast an appeal by Marshal Petain to Frenchmen to refrain from actions - which would call down upon you tragic reprisals - France has become a battlefield - said the aged Vichy Chief --The circumstances of battle may compel the German army to take special measures in the battle area - accept this necessity

'An armada of four thousand ships and thousands of small landing craft invaded the northern French coast between Cherbourg and Caen - aerial pictures show our forces have already hacked their way inland a considerable distance.'

A follow-up entry at 1.30pm (British time) read: 'Through clouds five thousand feet thick Allied air forces threw eleven thousand aircraft of almost every type into the grand invasion of Europe which started this morning - they were bombing and strafing miles of Normandy's beaches and flying inland to break the enemy's communications.

'Thunderbolt pilots returned to England from the invasion area and reported that Allied troops were piling onto the shore of France apparently with little opposition and that the skies had been virtually cleared of German planes.'

One of the bulletins revealed how journalists relied on German sources for information during the early stages of the attack.

It read: 'For our principal information we still are drawing on German sources...

Stocks closed generally higher but below the day's best levels - the Dow Jones preliminary closing average for 65 stocks was up fourteen one-hundredths of a point at 50 75 - cotton figures in a firm and active market were up fifteen to thirty-five cents a bale

'If the Germans are right the attack extends along a hundred miles of beach from Cherbourg at the northern tip of the Normandy peninsula which appears to have been the prime immediate objective.'

Several hours into the attack the information was still sparse, but one note issued at 3.30pm reads: 'Prime Minister Churchill's expressed hope that we have achieved tactical surprise seems borne out by the developments.

'The initial German response has certainly been less than anticipated and the reaction of their air force has been surprisingly slow.'

An hour later, it was noted that 
Hermann Goering had told the German air forces the Allied invasion 'must
 be fought off even if it means the death of the Luftwaffe'.

In
 the last bulletin on the roll, U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt is 
quoted saying 'the country had full reason to be thrilled but he hoped 
that this would not lead to over-confidence.'

The report is tipped to fetch $18,500 when it goes under the hammer on June 5, the eve of the 70th anniversary of the raids.

Tom Lamb, an expert in history at auctioneers Bonhams, said: 'There is quite simply nothing known to be in existence like this.

'These ticker tape updates would have been rolling into newsrooms across the whole of the United States.

'Telex was cutting edge technology in the 1940s and it was by far the quickest way of getting news out to the world.

'The
 reports were coming in from embedded reporters and from High Command 
press releases and then sent out to the newsdesks almost instantly.

'The Dow Jones wire was a financial wire but it was interrupted to bring news on D-Day. Interestingly it still carried information on global stock markets.

'Typically the paper would have just been thrown away after being used but somehow this particular one was saved and has survived the last 70 years in tact.

'Its history is unclear but it is now being sold by a private collector and we expect there to be a huge amount of interest in it.'

The sale will take place at Bonhams' New York sale room on June 5.

On June 6, 1944, Allied forces, led by General Dwight D. Eisenhower, stormed the beaches of Normandy, France, on 'D-Day', beginning the liberation of German-occupied Western Europe during World War II.

The Normandy landings, codenamed Operation Neptune, were the beginning of Operation Overlord, the Allies' assault on German-occupied territory.

The mission was the largest amphibious invasion in history with over 160,000 soldiers, including 73,000 Americans, 61,715 British and 21,400 Canadians, involved and over 5,000 ships.

There was an initial airborne assault with 24,000 troops being parachuted into France before the sea landings began at dawn.

The Normandy coast was split into five sectors for the attack - Juno, Sword, Gold, Omaha and Utah.

The timing of the operation was crucial, with commanders needing the right weather, a full moon and the correct tidal conditions.

On D-Day alone, around 4,400 Allied troops died with a further 9,000 wounded or missing. Total German casualties are estimated at between 4,000 and 9,000.

The landings were a turning point in the war, opening up a second front - the Russians were already advancing on Germany from the east - and leading to the liberation of occupied Europe.

'The tide has turned. The free men of the world are marching together to victory!' Eisenhower said in an historic address after the invasion was launched.

Last year, tourist boards along the Normandy coast launched the new D-Day initiative to promote what it calls the 'Secteur mythique' - where much of the action took place.
