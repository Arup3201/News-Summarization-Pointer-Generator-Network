It's not something Kim Kardashian is used to hearing - but there is at least one club she cannot get in to.

The Soho House club on Sunset Boulevard refused membership to the reality star after she attempted to join 'numerous times', according to it former membership director.

In an article by The Hollywood Reporter, current and past staff and member open up about the elite club's intriguing membership policy, which values 'creativity' over net worth or job titles.

Not tonight, love: Kim Kardashian unsuccessfully tried to get Soho House membership numerous times, accrding to Soho House LA's former admissions boss

If there's one thing Kim Kardashian loves, it's a cleavage baring outfit. For the Grammys she donned a metallic Jean Paul Gaultier Haute Couture number straight from his catwalk show in Paris. With its plunging neckline and mile-high slit, this look left little to the imagination.

We're crazy for the belted waist and embellished shoulders, sleeves, and pockets. With her strappy sandals and sexy tousled hair, the reality star looks like a golden goddess.

Metallics are consistently a go-to item when it comes to red carpet dressing. Katy Perry and Rita Ora both dressed in shiny renditions for the award ceremony too. It's a look with which you just can't go wrong!

We've put together a selection of resplendent items below from Halston Heritage, Mac, and DVF to recreate Kim's look in a major way. Our favorite is the Badgley Mischka number by far!

'We denied access to every Real Housewife who applied,' said Tim Geary, the LA branch's former director of membership. 'Kim Kardashian has unsuccessfully tried numerous times.'

'Kobe Bryant showed up and chose not to join. We didn't let him up,' he added. 'There was a debate over Britney Spears. Not sure how that played out.'

The super-exclusive clique on 9200 Sunset Boulevard, now celebrating its fifth birthday, is the third such outpost, following its sister spots in London and New York. 

Creatives only: Every 'Real Housewife' who applied for membership was rejected, including the local ones from Beverly Hills

'We imposed a value system on a community that celebrates financial success over morality,' Geary claimed. 'Someone would put forward a name and note that their movie just made $200 million. 

'But someone may have known they were cheating on their boyfriend with a woman and were widely known to be an a**hole. That happened more than you would know. It was discussed in committee meetings. There was a great sense of doing the right thing. 

Geary said the worse the rejects were, the harder they took it - which gave some at Soho House immense satisfaction.

The yeses: Amy Adams, Cameron Diaz and Selena Gomez have all been seen at the elite club

'The very worst people, it mattered tremendously to them, which doubled our satisfaction in rejecting them, he said. 'People denied would say there must be a mistake. "When do I get my membership card?" There was no recourse.'

The former director said he once imagined a scheme where he would tell members they could vote to reject someone if they paid for the would-be applicant's annual fee, adding that 'certain people' would have had their membership paid for 20 times over had the rule been implemented.

He added that 'anyone who crows about their success or trades on it is quickly brought down', and that 'people who undersold themselves were likelier to be admitted'.

Nos and maybes: According to the article Kobe Bryant was refused entry while there was a 'debate' on whether or not to let Britney in

In Hollywood Reporter article, showrunners, writers and directors, as well as actors such as Amy Adams and Moderns Family's Jesse Tyler Ferguson, praise the club's privacy, its intimate setting, its cosy design and its stunning 360 degree view of Los Angeles.

One thing Kim Kardasian might have enjoyed at the club was a fun recent installation - called The Fear Of Rejection - consisting of a door with strobe lighting, music and laughter coming from behind it, while a girl with a clipboard and a velvet rope stood in front and told anyone who approached: 'I'm sorry, you're not on the list'.

Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez, Bradley Cooper, Cameron Diaz and Robert Pattinson have all been photographed there, while the article reminisces about parties thrown for Madonna and Keira Knightley.
