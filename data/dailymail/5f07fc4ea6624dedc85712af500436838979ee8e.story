Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal has admitted his team were lucky to beat Southampton 2-1 on Monday night.

Robin van Persie opened the scoring after a poor back pass from Jose Fonte before Saints striker Graziano Pelle ended his goal drought mid way through the first half to level the scores. But Van Persie earned all three points for his side with a smart finish from a second-half set piece.

The victory couldn't mask a poor performance from United though, who had just three shots all game.

Van Gaal told Monday Night Football: 'We lost the ball too easily. We didn't have very good positional play - that was not good in spite of our good result. 

'You need confidence on the ball and that we don't have that. 

'I think Southampton played better than Manchester United but we were the lucky guy. The performance was not good enough. We were the lucky team.' 

Paddy McNair was substituted before half time after a nervy performance, and while it will undoubtedly dampen the defender's confidence, Van Gaal insisted he had no choice.

Van Persie's form was perhaps the one highlight for Manchester United supporters

'He (McNair) had not any confidence, he had already given three big chances away I have to do it. 

'It's very disappointing for me and also for Paddy but I had to because as a manager I am responsible for the win and after we played better.'

The one highlight for United supporters will be the ever-improving form of striker Van Persie, and the Dutchman believes he is finally getting back to his best. 

Van Persie said: 'We didn't play our best football today. We were sloppy but we gave absolutely everything but in the end we nicked it. We're on the up.

'I've been feeling quite good over the last couple of weeks. I can play 90 minutes easy and each game it gets easier. That's what you want - then the goals and assists will come. 

'We're looking forward to that (the Liverpool game). We are really happy we're on the way up now we just have to continue.' 

Paddy McNair was substituted during the first half, the defender had not been playing well
