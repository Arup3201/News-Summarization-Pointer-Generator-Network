They are the foods that the average UK shopper hadn't even heard of just a decade ago.

But Britons can't live without chorizo, sweet chilli sauce and prosecco, according to a survey of changing culinary habits.

Research carried out by food magazine Olive found that although the spicy Spanish sausage was unheard of ten years ago, chorizo is a staple part of the diet of 42 per cent of those surveyed.

Staples of our diet: Most of us had never heard of chorizo or prosecco just a decade ago, but now most of us can't live without them

A further 35 per cent said they can't live without a bottle of sweet chilli sauce alongside the ketchup and mayo with almost a quarter rating a bottle of prosecco as a 'must have' in the wine rack.

The survey also found a change at the top in terms of who the nation rates as its favourite celebrity chef.

A fifth now favour Nigel Slater, with the Hairy Bikers and Michel Roux Jnr also proving popular with foodies.

But our favourite television chefs from a decade ago have declined in popularity.

Delia Smith, who topped a similar poll compiled by the magazine in 2003, gained just seven per cent of the vote this time around.

Faring little better were Nigella Lawson, with just nine per cent of the vote and Jamie Oliver, who polled just 11 per cent.

The survey also found that more than half of us are cooking from scratch more often than we were 10 years ago but, perhaps due to the recession hitting us in the wallets, only a third of us are dining out more.

When we do eat out, 40 per cent of us say that chain restaurants are what make us most unhappy about the modern food scene, followed by bad service and the 'prohibitively expensive' cost of eating out.

Cupcakes were rated the favourite food trend of the decade with locally produced seasonal food, farmers' markets and 'diverse cuisine' increasing in popularity, no doubt because of the influx of cookery shows on television.

Olive editor Christine Hayes said: 'In the last decade, we have witnessed a period of profound change in the UK food scene.

'We are far more diverse in our tastes and seek out great value whether cooking at home or eating out at home and abroad.

'Nigel Slater's relaxed cooking style and the seasonal, often home-grown, ingredients he uses chimes with the increased trend of using ingredients when they are at their best.'
