An internally flawless 100 carat diamond described as 'perfect' by experts is expected to sell for a staggering £16 million.

The Type IIa diamond, which is in a classic emerald cut and is 'whiter than white', was mined by De Beers in South Africa.

Its current owner spent more than a year studying, cutting and polishing the rough diamond to deliver the spectacular stone.

The emerald cut white diamond has been described as 'whiter than white' and the 'definition of perfection'

It is expected to sell for £16 million ($25 million) at Sotheby's in New York at the Magnificent Jewels auction

 The stone is one of just five diamonds of similar quality over 100 carats that have ever been sold publicly

Less than one per cent of the world's diamonds are Type IIa, and they are the most valuable of all

The result is what experts are calling the largest perfect diamond with a classic emerald cut ever to be offered at auction.

It is one of just five  diamonds of similar quality over 100 carats that have ever been sold publicly.

It will be sold by Sotheby's at its Magnificent Jewels auction in New York on April 21.

Gary Schuler, head of Sotheby's jewelry department in New York, yesterday described the 100.20 carat diamond as 'the definition of perfection'.

He said: 'The colour is whiter than white, it is free of any internal imperfections, and so transparent that I can only compare it to a pool of icy water.

'It is the first true emerald cut diamond over 100 carats to be offered at auction - the most classic of cuts, quietly elegant and very contemporary.'

Less than one per cent of the world's diamonds are Type IIa, and they are the most valuable of all diamonds.

The diamond's current owner has spent more than a year studying, cutting and polishing the raw stone

The 'internally flawless' diamond was mined in South Africa and weighed more than 200 carats in the rough

Sotheby's describes the jewel as the 'rarest object of natural beauty on the market right now'

The diamond will be exhibited in Dubai, Los Angeles, Hong Kong, London and Doha, before returning to New York for exhibition in April.

If it sells for £16 million ($25 million), it will be among the most expensive diamonds ever sold publicly.

The current record is $30.6 million, which was paid for a 118.28 carat diamond at a 2013 Sotheby's sale in Hong Kong.

Lisa Hubbard, chairman of North & South America for Sotheby's International Jewelry Division, said: 'The rarest object of natural beauty on the market right now, this 100-carat diamond could be considered the ultimate acquisition.

'It has everything you could ever want from a diamond. The classic shape begs to be worn, while the quality puts it in an asset class of its own.

'The stone gives you so many options - admire it un-mounted, wear it as a simple but stunning pendant, or mount in a designed jewel.'
