Kingman produced the equivalent of a Sir Chris Hoy burn-up as he flew through the final two furlongs to imperiously land a tactical Qipco Sussex Stakes.

The British track cycling icon is a retired spectator at the Commonwealth Games but his name is still synonymous with high-speed two-wheel action.

In what turned into a two-and-a-half-furlong sprint, Kingman turned a one-and-a-half-length deficit into a length lead within 100 yards as he made 2013 winner Toronado look pedestrian.

James Doyle, rider of the John Gosden-trained 2-5 favourite, reckoned he got a Hoy-like feeling as Kingman went sub-11 seconds for the final two furlongs with a breakneck 10.22 secs for  the penultimate one,

Doyle said: ‘I’ve never experienced going around a velodrome when they go real slow and then sprint for two laps but that will be as close as I will get.’

While Gosden, who was winning the group one mile race for the first time, added: ‘I used have an old MGB GT and I used to get into fifth gear and then flick a button. You can do that with him. He has a gear and then he has another.

‘I had him in the (six-furlong) July Cup and he would have won it. I ran Gregorian, who was unlucky not to be a good second, and I wouldn’t have put them in the same work.’

In the pink: Doyle and Kingman romp home

The Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot in October is the one set target for the colt who has already won the Irish 2,000 Guineas and St James’s Place Stakes with the Prix Jacques Le Marois at Deauville seemingly the only other race under consideration.

It has been a memorable few days for Gosden, who won Saturday’s King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes with Taghrooda.

Kingman’s win stretched his lead over Richard Hannon to over £500,000 in the trainers’ championship.

For Hannon this meeting with its huge expectations has so far been one of frustration. He has not yet had a winner Toronado was one of five seconds he has saddled.

But there was no argument about the Sussex Stakes result.

Milking the applause: Kingman looks to the crowd as Goodwood cheers a popular winner

Richard Hughes, Toronado’s jockey, said: ‘I hit the two furlong pole at full belt and I knew it would take a good one to get by me. I got first run on him off a slow pace and he has still beaten me. I’ll have to bring a gun next time!’

A memorable day for Doyle and Khaled Abdullah, owner of Kingman, had started with Sir Michael Stoute-trained Snow Sky landing the Gordon Stakes. He goes for York’s Great Voltigeur Stakes and then probably the St Leger for which Ladbrokes make him a 12-1 shot.

Paul Hanagan, Taghrooda’s jockey, is facing at least two weeks on the sidelines after X-rays showed he suffered a hairline fracture of his left arm in the fall of White Nile on day one of the meeting.

Warwick will become a jumps only venue after owners Jockey Club racecourses said it will cease to hold Flat meetings from next year.
