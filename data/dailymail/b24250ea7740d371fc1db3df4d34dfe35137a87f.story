Manuel Pellegrini and his Manchester City squad touched down on home soil on Thursday evening following their Champions League dismissal by Barcelona the night before. 

The likes of Sergio Aguero, Joe Hart and Pablo Zabaleta wore pained expressions as they left Manchester airport following their humbling at the Nou Cup. 

Ivan Rakitic’s 31st-minute strike was enough to secure a 1-0 victory and ease the Catalan giants into the quarter-final of the European Cup with a 3-1 aggregate win.

Joe Hart was in inspired form against Barcelona as he thwarted a host of attacks from the Catalans 

Aguero had a penalty saved in the 78th minute that would have made the closing stages more interesting, but the reality is that Barcelona threatened to humiliate the Barclays Premier League champions only for a heroic goalkeeping performance from Hart. 

The squad returned to Manchester late on Thursday evening after they remained in Barcelona overnight and held a session at Espanyol's training ground earlier in the day. 

The players were given no time to mull over their European exit after they were taught a lesson over two legs by Lionel Messi and Co.

After such a commanding performance by the La Liga leaders captain Vincent Kompany was forced to admit that Manchester City are still a long way behind the very best in Europe.

'The reality is they were a better team, there is no shame in admitting that. For me there is a big, big difference.

'I will just mention Bayern Munich and Barcelona, and then there are the rest of the teams, with Real Madrid probably in between.

'Ultimately we have always said our goal is to become as good as them, but it will take some time. They are really good.'

Pellegrini echoed Kompany's comments and admitted that Barcelona, with the mesmeric Messi at the helm, are simply a better side than City at present.  

‘Messi was imperious - at the moment we have to accept Barcelona are better,' said Pellegrini. 

‘It is not a failure, it is a disappointment. We have been unlucky to play Barcelona for two years in a row. We have had a restriction on the number of players we can use in the Champions League.'

'It is very difficult to beat Barcelona, but the statistics I don’t care about. ‘We cannot analyse what we will do next season because it is too soon after this result. We can do that later.

‘It is not easy to play Barcelona. This is the draw, they are very strong. At least we have improved.’
