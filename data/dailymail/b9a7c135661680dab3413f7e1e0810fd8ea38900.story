You wait years for a new console to turn up, and then two arrive at once.

Following Microsoft’s Xbox One launch last week, Sony have finally launched their PlayStation 4 – and the good news is, there’s plenty of quality launch games. Here, MailOnline runs the rule over the biggest ones.

Killzone: Shadow Fall 5/5

Simply the best: At the risk of annoying Xbox One fans, Killzone: Shadow Fall is hands-down the best-looking launch title on either console

Quite simply, breath-taking. Boasting visuals on par with some of the best-looking PC games around, Shadow Fall is the definitive launch title to show the PS4’s impressive power. But it’s not all style over substance.

Following the painfully average Killzone 3 on last-gen, Shadow Fall is a real step forward in the series in terms of level design and gameplay.

Clearly influenced by Halo and Crysis, there’s less emphasis on shooting from behind cover and firefights encourage you to use the multi-tiered levels to your advantage.

Coupled with the new OWL – a handy flying drone that lets you shoot ziplines, hack terminals and attack baddies - and there's plenty of freedom to approach levels how you want.

AI is strong, too. Enemies will flank and throw grenades if you’re too ‘cover happy’. But the star of the show are the environments. Gone are the grey, mono-tone city-scapes that plagued the last games.

Here, you’ll be dodging trains in the sun-kissed city of Vetka, skydive from orbit and glide between crumbling buildings, and traverse ruined worlds where the ground falls apart beneath your feet.

Shadow Fall isn’t just a launch game. It’s THE launch game, and essential for any PS4 owner.

Call of Duty: Ghosts 3/5

That a boy: Riley is one of many new characters in Ghosts and takes centre stage during stealth missions

It may not do anything to evolve the series (in fact, some may argue it’s a step back), but there’s still fun to be had here. After the brilliant opening level - which somehow manages to mix a walk in the woods with a mission to space - it's very much business as usual.

New mechanics including the use of a 'remote controlled' dog, Riley, are fun but ultimately underdeveloped, while the set-pieces aren't quite as epic as you'd expect. You do, however, get to see a German Shepherd take down a helicopter...

Unlike the Xbox One, Ghosts runs in 1080p (full high definition) on PS4, so expect it to be on par with PC versions of the game.

Compared to current-gen, framerate runs at 60FPS consistently, so everything feels more fluid, too.

Far from an essential purchase, and not quite a 'next-gen' COD, but still worth a look if you haven’t bought it already.

Putty Squad – 4/5

Blast from the past: Putty Squad does nothing to show off the power of the hardware, but oozes charm and an addictive pick-up-and-play structure

Some may find it strange seeing this game among the heavy-hitters at launch, but don’t write this quirky offering off too quickly.

Harking back to the golden age of gaming, this deliciously simple platformer offers something completely different to the other titles.

You play Putty, who’s on a mission to save his friends. Cue loads of levels, incredibly cute enemies and a solid retro soundtrack.

It won’t show off the PS4’s power by any means, but as a cut-price title it’s fantastic value for money and worryingly addictive, too. Plus, it's sure to appeal to fans of 'indie-style' games.

Injustice: Gods Among Us 4/5

Dark Knight rises (again): This may be one of the 'older' games available at launch, but for comic book fans who haven't played it yet, Injustice is worth picking up

Can’t wait to see Batman take on Superman on the big screen in a couple of years? Then this is for you.

Developed by the team behind the acclaimed last-gen Mortal Kombat remake, this beat-em-up lets you play as some of the world’s most famous superheroes.

All are beautifully recreated and have trademark moves that stay true to their roots. Batman, for example, can call in the Batmobile to run foes over – while The Flash can sprint around the world before upper-cutting his opponent in the face.

There are plenty of levels, too, ranging from Superman’s ice cave and the dark, back streets of Gotham, to the Justice League HQ that floats miles above the Earth. Each stage is multi-tiered with stunning 'transitional moves' used to unlock each area.

Fights are cleverly interwoven into a strong narrative, too – so, unlike Xbox One exclusive Killer Instinct (which, in fairness, is targeting a slightly different audience), there’s plenty of incentive to play on your own.

Knack 2/5

Haven't got the knack of it: At times Knack looks great - but, similar to Ryse; Son of Rome, there's no depth

There is always going to be one dud in a launch line-up, and this year it’s Knack. Don’t be charmed by its (semi) impressive visuals, for this bland platformer offers nothing apart from repetitive combat and boring platforming elements.

Most of the game is spent strolling through levels and dodging attacks. Tedious enough, but made even worse by frequent slowdown.

In its defence, there is some variation in the level design – ranging from ice caves to forests – and at times it can look rather pretty. But it’s lacking the 'soul' and charm of, say, Putty Squad. Avoid.

Need for Speed Rivals 4/5

Burn rubber: In Rivals you can choose to play as a Cop or a Racer, then zoom around in the world's fastest cars

‘Where are the slow motion crashes of Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit?’ some fans may ask. No matter, as this stunning racer gets nearly everything else perfect. Set in the open-world of Redview County, you can choose to be either a Cop or a Racer.

The former is tasked with bringing as many Racers to justice – helped with a variety of Pursuit tech.

These range from roadblocks to calling in Police choppers. Racers, on the other hand, have their own weapons – such as EMPS and other evasion tech.

It also introduces the AllDrive system, where players can seamlessly transfer from playing on their own to playing with the online community.

Graphically, it looks stunning – and runs arguably smoother than on Xbox One. The star of the show, though, are the cars. Speed through a puddle, and you’ll be treated to every last drop of water delicately sliding down their pixel-perfect chassis.

Whereas Forza focused on simulation, Rivals portrays its exotic cars as grunting beasts that need manhandling if you're to tame Redview's challenging corners.

Thanks to an in-game GPS system, you’re constantly given the shortest routes to objectives – be that other races or time trails, so you’re never out of the action for long.

Battlefield 4 4/5

What a view: This shot, taken from the opening level, is one of the most memorable sights in the single-player campaign. Still, most will skip this and dive straight into the glorious multiplayer

The campaign may have been a bit of a mixed bag with critics (I, for one, enjoyed it), but there is no doubt this is the best first-person multiplayer game around at the moment.

Thanks to the PS4’s superior power, you can play with 32 players on each side – meaning the large maps are much less sparse than on current gen.

Powered by the ‘full fat’ Frostbite 3 Engine, it looks wonderful, too – just a fraction behind the very top PC versions.

You’ll often be torn between choosing COD or Battlefield, but this year, Battlefield is a clear winner.

LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 5/5

Look out below! The Hulk takes on Sandman in the brilliant LEGO Marvel Super Heroes

Another epic super hero game – this time a bit more tongue in cheek. Yes, it’s been out for a while and is on Xbox One – but those who opt for this system will be hard-pressed to find a more enjoyable platformer.

Featuring an eclectic mix of the best-known heroes and a glorious open-world to explore, this will keep the kids happy for a long time.

Closing thoughts

So, which console has the better line up? Clearly both sides have strengths and weaknesses. Ryse: Son of Rome on Xbox One is a graphical masterpiece for the most part, but suffers from linear gameplay. But the Xbox claws back serious points with Forza 5.

The PS4, however, has a genuine classic in Killzone: Shadow Fall, something perhaps lacking with the Xbox launch titles.

The line-up is somewhat let down by Knack - a game that at one stage showed some promise - but this still fares better than both Crimson Dragon and Lococycle on Xbox One.
