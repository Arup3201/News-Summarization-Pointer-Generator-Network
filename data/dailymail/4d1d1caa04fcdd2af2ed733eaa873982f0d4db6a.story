A New York-based student who earned widespread criticism and notoriety earlier this year when she wrote an essay demanding that poor people should stop making her feel bad because she's rich has posted a follow-up article in which she complains that the media coverage of her outburst failed to make an issue of her sexuality.

Rachel Sacks, who is enrolled in a $40,000-a-year writing program at a New York liberal arts school, posted her latest musings – entitled They Could Find My House But They Couldn't Find Out I Was Gay - on Thought Catalog on Monday.

Sacks writes that she is upset with the media for not making an issue our of her sexuality, even though she admits it wasn't actually relevant to her previous essay about how a cashier at a grocery store close to her affluent West Village apartment was unfriendly and frowned at her because she had a designer bag.

Rachael Sacks, who gained notoriety over an essay about poor people hating her because she's rich, has now complained that the media didn't include the fact that she is gay even though she admits it wasn't relevant

‘I have Pride Flags hanging in the windows of my apartment,’ protests Sacks.

‘My Facebook account also says ''interested in women''. Reporters were able to find my home on Google Earth yet they were unable to see my sexuality blatantly listed for the public to see? It doesn’t add up.’

It was October when Sacks first gained notoriety after she posted her controversial essay on the Though Catalog site entitled I’m Not Going To Pretend That I’m Poor To Be Accepted By You.

In that article Sacks blogged: 'I am sorry that I was born into great financial circumstances and my father likes to provide for me. I am sorry I don’t have to go to a state school to save my parents money. What do you want from me?'

In the media firestorm that followed Sacks, 20, was unrepentant over her rantings and told the Mail Online that she was undeserving of the media attention it generated because she was a 'spoiled brat who masturbates too much'.

In her latest essay, Sacks freely admits that her sexuality has nothing to do with previous essay which gained her notoriety in the first place.

‘While my sexuality is irrelevant to the topic of my article, it still is part of who I am and should not be ignored,’ she admitted.

According to Sacks, she believes her sexuality was ignored because ‘it would look tacky to vilify me in the press in regards to my sexuality.’

‘Non normative sexuality has to be avoided completely as a topic of discussion because of all of the tragedies that have resulted from kids being bullied for being gay.’

On her blog, her ambition is stated as: 'Working on my goal of being a rich eccentric old person by writing a lot of things.'

The student has penned other articles 
entitled '13 Things That Should Exist For New York Women In Their 20s' 
and 'Confession: I'm a chronic female masturbator'.

In her essay about the hardships she faced as a rich person she wrote: 'People shouldn’t make others feel bad about their own personal finances. How people spend their money is their own choice.'

She continued: 'It just seems really petty and makes you look bitter and unhappy with your own life if you are casting nasty glares at college girls in Gristedes because you’re a cashier.'

The 20-year-old then argued: 'I’m not one of those people who try to be poor to relate to people.

'I think that’s honestly really disgusting behavior, it’s as if you’re saying that you have to make yourself into something you think is beneath you to get others to like you.'

She later claimed that she had no idea
 that she was rich while growing up because her family went to McDonalds
 and she wore clothes from Old Navy.

She added: 'I went to private school when I was younger and there would always be someone so much richer than me.

'There
 were kids who owned their own horses and whose parents were 
billionaires, so I had no idea that I had any money until I was about 14
 and people called me ''Rachael Sacks of Cash''.

Within hours of Sacks' previous article, she was flooded with deriding, mocking comments from people who didn't appreciate her perspective on wealth.

'Yes, let's all pity and feel bad for poor, judged, not smiled at,' one twitter user commented sarcastically.

A commenter on her story wrote: 'What a spoiled brat. Your parents did a horrible job of raising you. The level of entitlement in this article is mind blowing. No one is born spoiled, entitled and snobby.'

'That is a learned behavior. And it's 
repugnant. I hope that you can modify your behavior before you pass your
 horrible and selfish attitude down to your children,' another commenter
 added.

Sacks responded in fury at the negative responses her personal essay had drawn.

She posted on Twitter: 'I've been dealing with b****** since the third grade I've always been ready for haterz.'

She added: 'I'm just an obnoxiously loud voice of idiocy amongst billions.'

Gossip site Gawker piled on with a post headlined Rich Girl Not Going to Pretend She's Not Rich Just to Make Poors Happy.

Sacks was unrepentant in the face of criticism, telling her 'haters' to 'suck it'

With tuition and fees totaling nearly 
$40,000 a year and annual cost of attendance estimated at more than 
$61,000, it has been ranked as one of the most expensive college in the 
country.

Her father is Dr Preston Sacks, a prominent fertility doctor in Bethesda, Maryland. The family lives in a $700,000 home in Bethesda, Maryland.

Despite the massive influx of online criticism, Sacks doesn't appear to have changed her mind.

She tweeted: 'I'm rolling my eyes because I definitely don't deserve this much attention.'

Adding later: 'La la la everybody hates me guess ill eat some worrrrmmmsss. Suck it.'
