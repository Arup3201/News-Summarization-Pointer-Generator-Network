Two more inmates have gone on the run after fleeing an open prison, police revealed today.

Anthony Peloe, 43, who was serving an indeterminate sentence for possessing firearms with intent to cause harm, and convicted robber John Arnold, 30, absconded from Thorn Cross open prison.

Prison officials at the jail in Warrington, Cheshire, discovered the pair were missing at about 10.30am yesterday and alerted Cheshire Police who launched a manhunt for the inmates.

Officers are advising the public not to approach either prisoner, but are appealing to anybody who may have seen the two men or have information about their whereabouts to contact police urgently.

Superintendent Martin Cleworth said: ‘Cheshire Police are making every effort to locate these two men including liaising with colleagues in other forces. They may be travelling together or separately.

‘My advice to any member of the public who sees them is not to approach them, but to immediately ring police on 999.

‘I would also ask members of the public to be mindful that the men remain outstanding, and despite the hot weather, be cautious about leaving your house or car insecure with an open window.

‘If you have any concerns at all, contact your local police station.’

Arnold was sentenced to an indeterminate sentence carrying a minimum term of two years after being convicted of robbery in May 2006. He is described as white, around 5ft 11ins tall and slim.

Peloe
 was convicted of possession of firearms with intent to commit harm in 
December 2005. He was sentenced to an indeterminate sentence with a 
minimum tariff of three years.

He is described as a white man, 5ft 8ins tall, with brown hair and blue eyes. He may be wearing green prison issue trousers.

The pair are the latest in a string of inmates who have absconded from prisons in recent weeks.

The
 Mail reported earlier today how prisoners with a history of escaping 
will no longer be placed in open prisons, after a violent convict dubbed
 the Scarborough Slasher went on the run from a minimum security jail.

The
 Government ordered immediate changes after knife robber Damien Burns, 
39, and convicted thief Dean Jackson, 27, fled from a Category D prison 
in Doncaster, South Yorkshire.

Other escapees: Damien Burns, 39, (left) originally from 
Scarborough, North Yorkshire, and Dean Jackson (right), 27, from 
Newcastle-upon-Tyne, failed to return to the open prison HMP & YOI 
Hatfield in Doncaster

Police
 warned the public not to approach either of the men. They walked out on
 Monday night – just a fortnight after Michael ‘Skull Cracker’ Wheatley 
fled from an open prison in Kent, before being caught four days later.

It
 is the latest in a series of escapes that has heaped embarrassment on 
ministers and prompted critics to brand the prison service ‘beyond a 
joke’.

Burns, originally from
 Scarborough, North Yorkshire, and Jackson, from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, 
failed to return to the open prison HMP & YOI Hatfield in Doncaster on Monday evening.

Officers believe 
they may be attempting to make their way back to the areas they 
originate from as they do not have any known connections in the South 
Yorkshire region.

Burns was 
serving an indeterminate sentence, since 2007, for a knifepoint robbery 
and Jackson was on remand awaiting a sentence for a theft related 
matter.

Their escape came 
just a day after a murderer who absconded from an open prison was 
arrested after going on the run for the fourth time.

Arnold Pickering, 44, who stabbed a blind man to death, was held for being unlawfully at large at an address in Oldham.

The killer was recaptured by Greater Manchester Police after failing to return to jail on Saturday afternoon.

Thomas
 Moffett, a violent thief and fellow inmate with Nazi tattoos who was 
also on temporary licence, also absconded on the same day from the same 
prison. Moffett was arrested and is also being held in custody.

Their
 escape comes a fortnight after Michael ‘Skull Cracker’ Wheatley 
absconded from an open prison and allegedly robbed a building society 
before being caught four days later.

MPs have attacked the 'absolute scandal' of murderers being allowed out of prison 'willy nilly'.

In
 1991, a judge said Pickering appointed himself as an ‘executioner’ when
 he decided to kill 53-year-old Thomas Leigh, who was wrongly thought to
 be a paedophile.

Recent cases: Murderer Arnold Pickering (left), who stabbed a blind man to death, was arrested earlier this week after going on the run from jail. Another inmate, swastika-tattooed Thomas Moffett (right), 51, also failed to return from day release on Saturday but was arrested for being unlawfully at large

He was serving 18 years for that murder when he went missing on Saturday. His three previous escapes have been from Strangeways in Manchester and open prisons in Lancashire and Sussex.

Pickering
 and Moffett, 51, had been allowed out from HMP Kennet – an open 
category C prison in Maghull, Merseyside – at 9.30am on Saturday. They 
failed to return as agreed at 4.30pm.

Moffett,
 who has swastika tattoos on his arms, was jailed for seven years in 
2006 for a two-month spree of ‘professionally executed robberies’.

He
 threatened shop workers with a nail gun in a series of raids on 
off-licences in Blackburn. He was caught after an employee slipped an 
explosive dye pack into a bundle of cash.

Armed robber Michael Wheatley, AKA the Skull Cracker, went on the run for four days after absconding from open prison

An urgent review is currently taking place into why Wheatley was allowed temporary day release earlier this month.

The day release programme is 
designed to help prisoners settle back into ordinary life towards the 
end of their sentence by allowing them to attend work or training.

But it has come under fierce attack for leaving the public at risk from unreformed, dangeours criminals.

The
 Government has admitted that more than 1,600 murderers, druglords and 
other hardened criminals were granted day release last year.

Last
 July, Ian McLoughlin (pictured) was convicted of murdering Graham
 Buck in the village of Little Gaddesden, Hertfordshire, while on day 
release.

Murderer Joseph Williams carried out 11 armed raids on bookmakers after being handed a release pass in 2010.

And Mark Neville, a drug dealer, spent his day out of prison in 2008 overseeing a £14million cocaine deal.

Last week it was revealed more than 400 killers were kept in open prisons, which have minimal supervision.

Despite
 going on the run twice beforehand, the robber was allowed to walk out 
of Standford Hill open prison in Kent where he was serving 13 life 
sentences.

He was eventually
 caught in East London on May 7 after spending almost four days on the 
run and has since been charged with robbing the Chelsea Building 
Society, in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey, at gunpoint.

Last
 year, HM Chief Inspector of Prisons Nick Hardwick said HMP Kennet had 
‘needlessly restrictive’ security for an open prison.

Located near 
Liverpool, the prison is home to almost 350 men and is located next to 
Ashworth high security hospital,  which houses Moors murderer Ian Brady.

Justice
 Secretary Chris Grayling said: 'Keeping the public safe is our priority
 and I will not allow the actions of a small minority of offenders 
[to] undermine public confidence in the prison system

'Absconds
 have reached record lows under this Government but I take each and 
every incident seriously.  I have already ordered immediate changes to 
tighten up the system as a matter of urgency.

'With
 immediate effect, prisoners will no longer be transferred to open 
conditions or allowed out on temporary release if they have previously 
absconded, and there will also be no unrestricted "town leave" .

'I
 am clear that open prisons and temporary licence remains an important 
tool in rehabilitating long term offenders but not at the expense of 
public safety.'
