Hundreds of former Land Girls today attended the unveiling of a life-size statue in honour of their work during the two World Wars.

The 8ft high bronze sculpture, created by Denise Dutton, was unveiled by Sophie, Countess of Wessex, at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire.

 The tribute honours members of the Women's Land Army (WLA) who worked on farms during the wars when conscription and military casualties led to a shortage of labourers.

James Shallcross, assistant curator at the National Memorial Arboretum, said it was important to recognise the role Land Girls played during and after the two wars.

He said: 'The Women's Land Army was a major part of the effort to help the country in a time of conflict.

'Without their help the nation would probably have starved and may well have not won the Second World War.'

Mary, 84, who joined the WLA when she was 17, said: 'It was very physically demanding, but you were doing something for the country.

'They needed women on the farms because there weren't enough labourers to do the work.'

Staffordshire Women's Food and Farming Union (SWFU) took three years to raise £85,000 for the memorial. 

Land Girls worked on farms to feed the nation when men went to war. The official minimum age was 17, but some lied and became Land Girls at 16 or even younger.

Many had been barmaids, waitresses, maids, hairdressers or mill workers, and some enrolled straight from school.

With their uniform of green ties and jumpers and brown felt slouch hats, they toiled from dawn to dusk each day. They planted and harvested crops, tended animals and poultry, and delivered milk - all for £1.40 a week, with 70p deducted for board and lodging.

Often referred to as the 'Forgotten Army ', 20,000 surviving Land Girls were finally honoured in 2007 when the Government announced their efforts would be recognised with a commemorative badge.
