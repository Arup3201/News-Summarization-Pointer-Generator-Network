A coroner has warned about the dangers of alcohol after a quantity surveyor drank a pint of rum 'for a laugh' and later died.

Andrew Thompson, 29, had been drinking cans of lager with friends at a football match then went to a friend's house where a group of men were drinking shots of fortified wine.

A friend recalled Mr Thompson being 'full of bravado' and pouring a bottle of rum into a pint glass and downing it in one, an inquest heard in Leeds.

Mr Thompson was taken to St James' Hospital in Leeds but died five days later on March 29 this year

He fell asleep on the sofa and 
appeared to be snoring but about 2am his pals noticed he was a different
colour and called an ambulance.

Mr Thompson, from Allerton Bywater, 
West Yorkshire, a keen sportsman who regularly undertook charity events,
was taken to St James' Hospital in Leeds but died five days later on 
March 29 this year.

He sustained a severe brain injury caused by cardiac respiratory arrest.

West Yorkshire coroner David Hinchliff
said his alcohol level was 379 mg per 100 mls of blood which was almost
five times the legal limit for driving.

It would have caused him to fall into a
deep sleep, stifling his cough reflex and causing his stomach contents 
to enter his lungs.

He said: 'Andrew was a very bright and
charming man who excelled in everything he did, especially in his work.
He had a great love of sport and retained his friendships right from 
infant school into adulthood.

'He strikes me as a man who enjoyed 
life. Very sadly on this occasion he very foolishly had a great deal to 
drink, not just a few pints but to actually drink neat rum in the 
quantity he did pushed his blood level to within a fatal range.'

He said his death should act as a warning to others.

Mr Hinchliff said: 'He did it but 
didn't intend the outcome. It was just a group of young men having a few
drinks with a bit of rivalry and bravado and I suspect he liked to be 
at the centre of things and he did it for a laugh.

'I'm not convinced people know how dangerous alcohol can be. When people are consuming alcohol to that level it has this effect.

'It is a warning to others that what seems like a laugh at the time can have very serious consequences.'

Mr Hinchliff recorded a verdict of misadventure.
