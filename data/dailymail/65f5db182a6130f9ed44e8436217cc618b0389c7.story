Former Navy chaplain Gordon Klingenschmitt has voiced his outrage at the overturning of Proposition 8 in California, saying there's a 'demonic spirit of lawlessness' among government officials.

Klingenschmitt, who was discharged from the Navy for insubordination, made the comments on yesterday's episode of his YouTube program, Pray in Jesus Name.

The chaplain labeled various things 'lawless' during the show, including gay people, sodomy, the government officials who 'refuse to enforce the law' and lust.

Above the law: Klingenshmitt has labeled government officials who 'refuse' to enforce Proposition 8 'lawless'

'Lust is not love, and and whatever they're doing behind closed doors is not love in the homosexual community. It is lawlessness,' said Klingenschmitt, 'and it is causing the love of many to grow cold.'

Following his diatribe against homosexuality and the Californian lawmakers who 'refuse' to institute Proposition 8, Klingenschmitt led his viewers in prayer.

'Father in heaven, we pray that you would enforce your law... The law of love that prohibits lust, the law that prohibits sin, prohibits lawlessness. That God's highest law of true, selfless love will be established and will ban sodomy, which is a perversion and it's not love at all.'

The right-wing pundit spoke out in favor of discrimination in another installment of Pray in Jesus Name earlier this week.

'If
your heart is full of corruption or sin or immorality - in this case, 
homosexuality - then you should be discriminated against,' 
Klingenschmitt argued.

He then tried to prove that Martin Luther King Jr had advocated discrimination - just not on skin color. 

'When these confusing statutes now try to redefine discrimination and say that you can no longer discriminate against character... they're actually saying Martin Luther King himself ought to be punished for his views, and that's not right,' he concluded, somewhat nonsensically.

Klingenschmitt is no stranger to controversy.

He was court-martialled for disobeying orders and was eventually discharged from the Navy for turning up at anti-Navy protests in full uniform.

Publicity: Klingenschmitt publically protested at not being able to pray in Jesus name after Navy chaplains were asked to be 'inclusive' at command event settings that aren't specifically religious

Since then, he's made discrimination against the LBGT community his quest.

He has claimed that gay marriage will destroy straight marriage, but when questioned by David Pakeman last month about how his marriage to his wife had been affected by gay people marrying each other, he was unable to come up with a single reason. 

Later, he published a list of seven ways in which his marriage was affected by gay marriage, including that it had increased his taxes and increased the national debt due to 'tax benefits' given to gay couples.
