Glen Beck drew his last breath tonight...on his television show at least.

The Fox News host filed his last ever show with a series of bizarre rants that repeatedly returned to the reason why he had decided to call time on the programme after two-and-a-half years.

He promised a so-called cynical media 
that he would be back adding 'you will pray for the time when I was only
on the air for one hour a day.'

Beck bows out: Fox News host Glenn Beck filled his last ever TV show with bizarre ramblings about what he was planning to do next

Beck went on to reveal his plans in a live Q and A after the show online.

From September Beck will broadcast a two-hour daily show on his GBTV internet network.

He is also launching a charity programme called Mercury One, the name of which he revealed during his live TV show.

Mercury One will be a 'humanitarian' project that will gather people to help others in disasters and tragedies, Beck explained.

'It will be part of a rapid response team everywhere in America, in every town...everywhere,' he added.

Legacy: Beck said he and his audience must have 'faith, hope and charity' going forward

He is even planning a clothing line called 1791, the same date the U.S. Bill of Rights was ratified.

'It's not about GBTV, it's about 
saving the world,' Beck said before setting out a challenge for people 
to sign up as 'peace ambassadors.'

'It's 828,
it's' Restoring Courage.'

During his hour-long last show, Beck said he was heading to Israel in search of 'courage.'

'What makes 
people live in Israel? he asked. 'It 's a ticking time bomb. How do I get some of 
that courage? I begin my search after this programme.'

The infamous chalk boards: CNN may have graphics, but Fox has chalkboards, Beck told his audience

The show, broadcast live, kicked off with Beck reliving the last two-and-a-half years with a montage of best bits.

Before that he had taken the cameras back stage to see where the props for the show were kept or 'magnet alley' as he called it.

Floor to ceiling shelves groaned 
under the weight of aids the Fox host had used over the years to express
certain metaphors. Quiet what a chainsaw was doing there was anyone's 
guess.

Looking back: Beck admitted he'd done many things in order to 'hack the left off' as he went over his best bits

There was also cases and cases of chalk for writing on the infamous chalkboards of the show.

Beck later joked that 'CNN use graphics, we use chalkboards,' adding that he always felt as though he had chalk on his trousers.

There was some speculation Beck may cry. He didn't but there were many emotional moments - genuine and hammed.

'I've met amazing friends' on this show, he said. 'Namely you.'

Beck then went on to talk about all the 'amazing' things the Glen Beck Show has taught the people of America.

End of an era: The blinds go up and the set is dismantled as Beck says a final farewell to his audience

Should the topics have slipped anyone's memory, they were all handily written up on a chalkboard titled: 'Things we've learned.'

'How many people knew about the great depression of 1920' before the show? Asked Beck.

'We showed you.'

'We are the same, me and you,' he continued before adding: 'I may be able to figure out some things little faster than you.'

He's
well known for going on a bit but in tonight's show Beck actually 
celebrated his 'staggeringly long monologues' saying that a 21 minute 
stint was normal for the show now.

He even took on Jon Stewart, berating him for having 'so many writers' for 'just six minutes' worth of material.

He then brought in his show's writers, all two of them. They shuffled about and looked at the floor for a bit before the show went to a commercial break.

Beck, teasing the audience, kept suggesting he would reveal the real reason why he was leaving 'next,' but never quite made it.

'There were people who said I was fired,' Beck said in a booming voice before going on to suggest if he had been sacked he wouldn't be in the midst of a live broadcast.

Many asked if he was negotiating his contract Beck added, even his agent.

But in the end Beck said he was standing in his New York City apartment looking at the skyline after 'hanging out with Bono' backstage after watching Spiderman: Turn off the Dark musical, currently on Broadway, and thought: 'If you don't leave now, you will not leave with your soul.

'Never want anything too much,' he said. 'It will destroy you.'

Beck ended the show saying he was 'determined to fix this country one family, one entrepreneur at a time,' with his new project 'Mercury one.'

He failed to say what that was exactly, but left the audience in no doubt that he'd be back soon.Â
