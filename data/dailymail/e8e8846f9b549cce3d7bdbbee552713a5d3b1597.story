A hand and a head could be seen sticking out of the shingle on Brighton beach yesterday morning after a passer-by discovered a man's body.

The area was cordoned off by Sussex Police while they investigated following a call from a member of the public at 9.25am - and they had to work quickly to remove the body before the tide came in.

The body and police tape were both taken away before high tide at 2pm. The previous high tide was about 12 hours earlier at 1.40am, but it is not clear when the body ended up on the beach.

Investigation: The area was cordoned off by officers following a call from a member of the public this morning

A Sussex Police spokesman told MailOnline: 'Police were informed by a member of the public that they had found a body on the beach at Brighton today [Sunday] at 9.25am.

â€˜Police officers and the coroner's officers are working to establish the circumstances of how the body came to be there. The man has not been identified yet.'

The force said it will be checking missing persons reports to find out whether any are connected. Police cannot yet say if the death was suspicious but confirmed the body was male.

The body was found close to the start of the Volk's Electric Railway tourist attraction, and near the Dukes Mound gardens - an area popular with gay men meeting for casual sex.
