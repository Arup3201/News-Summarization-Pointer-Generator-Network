Halle Berry is behind the relaunch of Scandale, an 80-year-old luxury lingerie label that will now be available for affordable prices at Target.

The actress's first ten-piece collection, with prices ranging from $7 to $18, will hit stores October 27.

'I understand that women want to feel sexy and beautiful,' the 48-year-old told WWD, explaining her interest in the brand.

Sexy new venture: Halle Berry has invested in Scandale, an 80-year-old lingerie label that will launch in Target

'They want to have undergarments that are very functional, but to still feel beautiful when we take our clothes off.

'That’s really important and that’s a way to make women feel sexy and validated — all the ways we as women need to feel. And I love lingerie. It’s always been important in my life. This is a very important endeavor that feels very in line with who I am.'

Ms Berry discovered Scandale, founded by textiles designer Robert Perrier in 1932, while shopping in Paris with her husband Olivier Martinez, and researched its history before deciding to relaunch the label.

According to the company's website, Mr Perrier was manufacturing corsetry and hosiery in a small factory in France when he started the label.

After a visiting salesman introduced him to a new fabric, he created a girdle that was so delicate and light compared to the restrictive corsets of the time that his assistant exclaimed 'C’est un scandale!' upon seeing it.

'We've taken this brand and revamped it,' Ms Berry told the Associated Press. 'But we've kept all the qualities of the Parisian sort of style intact.'

The sexy star has been a Revlon brand ambassador since 1996, but said she wanted to have a greater role in leading a company.

'I decided for my own evolution as a woman and an entrepreneur, it’s time for me to step out and really be part owner of something that I believed in and not just lend my name to a brand,' she said.

Ms Berry now owns 50per cent of the brand, which is co-owned by her business partner Erik Ryd, founder of the intimates company Hop Lun.

The mom-of-two, who stars in the upcoming thriller Kidnap, admits that it takes a lot of work to juggle an acting career with the demands of running a business.

'You have to really want to do it. It’s time-consuming. You have to work hard at it,' she said.

'Along with the career you already have, it’s another job, if you will, that you’re tackling.'
