In the dock: Jacqui Porter, 40, denies a single count of concealing or converting proceeds of crime and says her husband's life of crime happened without her knowledge

The wife of a fraudster who stole millions from a property company claims she knew nothing about his life of crime despite it funding  luxury cars and holidays for his family, a court heard today.

Company director Gerald Porter, 51, cheated his firm Greenfield Property Management Limited (GPML) to lead a super-rich lifestyle with wife Jacqui, jurors heard.

But Mrs Porter, 40, wept today as she said her ‘cad’ husband cheated on her and embroiled her in his fraud while he partied at the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles, a court heard.

She denies any knowledge of her former husband’s crime, claiming she was at home looking after their children and had no idea what he was up to.

She is accused of concealing or converting the proceeds of crime after allegedly using company cards for designer spending sprees and writing cheques from his company's accounts. 

‘I was totally unaware of a lot of things that Gerry was doing,' she said.

'I was at home with the children and he was at work and I ran my side of things at home and he did his business things - the two didn’t cross over'.

But her Scottish husband was having affairs and often on business trips, leaving her with piles of blank cheques to cover the family’s vast expenses and top up his legitimate £60,000 salary.

‘At least once a month he would be away for a long weekend and sometimes he would be away for a week at a time,' she said.

‘I think you heard from Brian [Comer, co-owner of GPML] that he went to Vegas and Los Angeles for the Lennox fight, he also visited the Playboy Mansion,’ she said.

When Gerald scored his dream job with the Comers, he told her he was given a £25,000 ‘golden handshake’ and a salary of £150,000, the court heard.

And he quickly started using GPML cash to bankroll contracting companies and to take set up businesses including a coffee shop and a nursery at the North London Business Park, it is said.

Jacqui was recruited into the fraud, taking a substantial salary from companies she did minimal work for and writing more than a hundred cheques using GPML’s accounts.

Evidence: Mrs Porter said her husband was away for long periods on trips where he would cheat on her, go to sporting events and even the Playboy Mansion, picture, on one occasion, the court heard

But she denies any knowledge of the scam, telling jurors Gerald fooled her into believing the GPML cash covered a shortfall in his salary and would be declared to the Inland Revenue.

‘Gerry would leave a pile of [signed cheques] and say that of someone was coming to the house to write out the cheque,’ she said.

‘I didn’t think it was inappropriate because Gerry told me it was all going to be balanced at the end of the financial year.’

Jacqui met her husband while working as an industrial chemicals saleswoman when he offered her a lift in his forklift truck across a muddy Uxbridge building site in 1994

He initially moved into her three-bed council home but by 2005 the family with two new children moved to a five-bed rented mansion, costing more than £32,000 a year.

The ex-policeman had a number of affairs throughout their relationship but Jacqui stuck by her husband, saying she felt responsible for becoming ‘fat and unattractive’ after the birth of her fourth child.

Former rugby star Kenny Logan said he was taken in by Gerarld Porter a court heard. The Scottish winger gave evidence as a witness in the trial of Mr Porter's wife, Jacqui, today

‘A package came through my door with a bundle of emails in it - they were very explicit,’ she sobbed.

‘They basically said Gerry had been having an affair with a lady he worked with and that I was stupid that I didn’t realise what had been going on, that basically he was a cad and philanderer and that I should leave him.’

Gerald also took a ‘high ranking police officer’ as a lover and temporarily left the family home, jurors heard.

Jacqui went on credit card spending sprees across the world blowing thousands of pounds in French Connection, Emporio Armani and other designer labels in Dubai, the court has heard.

She claims the Barclaycard, which was funded by the company, was only used for ‘emergencies’, the jury was told.

Former rugby star Kenny Logan, husband of one of the BBC sport’s most highly paid presenters, said he knew Porter through his rugby world connections and was sucked into a ‘life of fantasy’.

Rugby fan Gerald spent part of the cash on the London Wasps Rugby Club and Mr Logan who was unwittingly sponsored with the illegal cash.

Gerald introduced himself to Mr Logan in an airport lounge and boasted he was the sponsor of rugby star Fraser Waters, a member of the London Wasps Rugby Club.

Mr Logan believed Gerald to be a director of Comer Group, the parent company of GPML, and even entered into an investment with the Scotsman.

Mr Porter ploughed £100,000 of GPML cash into Championship side London Scottish while the west London-based club were struggling financially and in the fourth-tier of the English rugby league.

He even provided a Mercedes to the coach, unbeknown to the club, causing ‘a lot of confusion’ when the sacked coach attempted to hand it back.

At one VIP dinner, held to celebrate the team winning the Heineken cup, Gerald arranged sponsorship by the Comer Group which would have cost ‘about £15,000’, jurors heard.

It seemed that ‘money was no object’ for him who would indulge his passion by buying tables costing thousands at exclusive rugby events.

He did not even attend one dinner at the upmarket Balmoral Hotel in Edinburgh, worth £5,816, the court heard.

He also splashed out on ‘top wines’ at ‘top restaurants’ including Claridges, in London and he ‘thought nothing’ of hiring helicopters to transport people to events.

Mr Logan, who is married to TV presenter Gabby Logan (left), said he was ashamed to have introduced Mr Porter to his mother-in-law Christine Yorath (pictured, right, with her husband, former footballer Terry Yorath)

The family jetted across the globe, taking luxury holidays to Bermuda, Mexico, Dubai and New Zealand which would have required an ‘astronomic’ salary to support them.

They boasted a fleet of cars, including a Bentley used as a ‘company car’, a Range Rover, a BMW and a VW Beetle,

The couple spent £130,000 a year - their total legitimate household income - on private school fees for their four children to attend prestigious St. Benedict’s in Ealing, west London.

And they hosted lavish parties at the family’s rented mansion in Harefield, Hillingdon, where a bouncy castle stood in the ‘park-like’ gardens, it was said.

A further £62,000 was spent wining and dining at Royal Ascot and helicopters were chartered to ferry the family around, jurors heard.

Gerald defrauded GPML, a subsidiary of the Comer Group, out of ‘many millions of pounds’ between 2004 and 2010, the court heard.

Brian Comer, who owns the Comer Group with brother Luke, told jurors Gerald was ‘smooth talking’.

Gerald quickly recruited ‘dishonest kindred spirit’ Gibrilla Kamara, a security guard at the North London Business Park, to be his bookkeeper and fiddle company accounts to conceal the six-year fraud.

Mr Logan (centre in 2000) told the trial he had come to know Mr Porter around the time he played for Wasps

When ‘the wheels came off’ Jacqui immediately cashed in on the family savings and used the money to secure a further year in private school for the children and a year’s rent on the family home, it is said.

She was ‘making hay while the sun shined’, jurors heard.

Gerald was working at Middlesex University when he met the Comer brothers - Brian and Luke - who employed him as a company director of Greenfield Property Management Limited.

The company collected service charges and ground rent from tenants which could be in excess of £1m.

But former policeman Gerald and Kamara - who are not before the court - started to divert the cash into their own account giving them ‘direct and unfettered control of the money’.

Jacqui Porter, of Ruislip, west London, denies a single count of concealing or converting the proceeds of crime.

There is no suggestion that Kenny Logan or his wife Gabby had any idea that Porter was a fraudster.

The trial continues.
