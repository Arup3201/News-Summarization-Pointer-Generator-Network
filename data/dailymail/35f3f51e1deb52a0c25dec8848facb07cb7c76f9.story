Forget Mad Mario, Italy striker Balotelli wants to be known as the best striker in the world ahead of the Azzurri’s showdown with England in Manaus.

The 23-year-old has hit the headlines for various off-the-pitch reasons during his short career to date, but the AC Milan forward wants to make the news for his on-the-field antics in Brazil.

‘I understand that the press like to write about Mario,' he said. 'Some of the stories are true and some of them are not, it doesn't matter to the media as long as they are writing about me - because obviously that is what people are interested in.

'I don't like to be known as "Mad Mario" I want to be known as the best striker in the world.

The former Manchester City enigma is widely expected to start for Italy ahead of their Group D World Cup opener against England in Manaus on Saturday and he hopes the match can be the platform for the Azzurri to win a fifth World Cup.

‘You can achieve that status by having one incredible World Cup - and that starts against England,' he added.

'The most important thing is that Italy do well - but personally I want people to be talking about me after the Brazil for the right reasons - and also calling me a World Cup Winner.’
