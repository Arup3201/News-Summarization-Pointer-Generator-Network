Professor Christina Slade, Vice-Chancellor of Bath Spa University, spent £42,000 in a year on luxury flights across the world, it has been revealed

A £300,000-a-year university vice-chancellor spent £42,000 in a year on luxury flights across the world, it has been revealed. 

Professor Christina Slade, vice-chancellor of Bath Spa University, used her expense account to fly business class in order to 'drum up interest' around the globe.

She is of a number of well-paid university Vice-Chancellors who used expenses accounts for luxury travel. 

Her expenses were revealed in a study by the University and College Union (UCU), which has criticised the 'murky world' of university pay. 

UCU asked every university in the country to reveal how much their top staff were paid and how much they claimed in expenses in 2013-14. 

The top paid Vice-Chancellor is Neil Gorman, of Nottingham Trent University, who raked in a staggering £623,000 including bonuses. 

Prof Slade said that her travel bill is essential for drumming up interest among foreign students and that travelling business class is 'the norm for Vice-Chancellors'.

The travel bill is on top of her £299,000-a-year salary, which rose 16 per cent last year.

UCU spokesman Nick Varney said: 'It's a chaotic state of affairs where some vice chancellors spend thousands on travel or enjoy large pay rises.

'This lifts the lid on the inconsistent and arbitrary nature of senior pay and perks in our universities and shines a light on the murky world of the shadowy remuneration committees who sign off these deals.

'We need a far more transparent system that allows for proper scrutiny of the spending at the top and the rationale behind pay rises.' 

Figures obtained from 150 institutions under the Freedom of Information Act show the average overall salary package for university heads in 2013/14 was £260,290.

A total of 18 vice-chancellors saw their pay rise by more than 10 per cent, the lecturers’ union calculated.

A spokesperson for Bath Spa University said Prof Slade had gone abroad to recruit international students after falling numbers put courses and jobs at risk. 

'The increase in international students has replaced the student numbers removed in the wake of an earlier decision on fees.

'There have been no staff redundancies as a result of downsizing at Bath Spa University, making it unique in its part of the sector.

'Without the international students, redundancies would have been necessary.

'This international development has involved an enormous amount of travel, often at short notice and generally long haul.

'Business class is the norm for V-Cs. Professor Slade has not travelled first class.' 

UCU asked 155 UK universities and colleges a series of questions about vice-chancellors’ pay packages, including benefits and pensions, as well as money spent on air fares, hotel accommodation and personal expenses, for the year ending July 31 last year.

Around 16 per cent- 24 institutions - did not respond or cited exemptions and did not release the requested information.

The findings show that the average overall salary package for university heads in 2013/14 was £260,290 based on data from 150 institutions. 

The average expenditure on flights for university leaders, with information from 128 universities, was £9,705.75.

The most was spent by the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), which paid out £59,811.14 on flights for director Professor Craig Calhoun.

Overall just over two-thirds of air fares were for first or business class, UCU said, according to data from 114 universities.

The average spend on hotel accommodation during 2013/14 was £3,202.05, based on data from 122 institutions. The most was spent by Glasgow Caledonian University for Professor Pamela Gillies at £27,271.13.

The average received by vice-chancellors in personal expenses was £3,112.61, according to information gathered from 125 universities.

The highest amount - £33,526 - was given to Professor Gavin Henderson of the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama.
