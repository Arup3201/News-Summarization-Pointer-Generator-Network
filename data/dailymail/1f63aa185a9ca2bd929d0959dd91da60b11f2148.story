The mother of a 16-day-old baby, who died one day after her family missed a scheduled home visit from the Department of Children and Families, said on Wednesday that she and her husband are good parents and would never harm their child.

Bailey Irish was not breathing when she 
was brought to HealthAlliance Hospital on April 26 by her parents Travis
 Irish, 26, and Charis Irish, 24.

She was pronounced dead shortly before 8am. A cause of death has not been established and no criminal charges have been filed.Â 

Mrs Irish, of Fitchburg, Massachusetts, said that she and husband Travis are 'heartbroken' over the death of her newborn daughter.

Bailey Irish's 24-year-old mother Charis said on Wednesday that she is 'heartbroken' over the death of her 16-day-old daughter last Saturday

Ms Irish told the Boston Globe:
 'We love our children and would never neglect or abuse our children in 
any way. Anyone who is close to us would vouch for that.'

The District Attorney is investigating the baby girl's death. Family services have taken the Irishs' 18-month-old son into their care.

The agency had planned a home visit for 
Friday, the day before Bailey Irish died, but the family was not home 
and it was rescheduled for April 28.

The DCF last visited the family on March 26, according to the Telegram.

'DCF received a 51A report and is investigating this tragic death, ' spokesperson Cayenne Isaksen wrote in a statement.

'We
 are cooperating fully with law enforcement in their active 
investigation. The family has been receiving support and services from 
DCF since October 2012.'

A 51A is a report of suspected neglect or abuse.

Community support: A fundraising page has been established to help the family with funeral costs for their daughter

The baby's father Travis Irish issued a plea for help in the form of donation towards her funeral costs on social media last week.

A fundraising page has been established for the purpose called Bailey's Wings.

'Bailey was taken too soon from us. This family is going through enough with the loss of their sweet angel,' it reads, adding that the pain the family is in is too 'unbearable to think about.'
