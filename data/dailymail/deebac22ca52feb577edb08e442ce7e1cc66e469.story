We are not going to visit Mars anytime in the next decade or two - so the next best thing is to bring some of the Red Planet back to us.

So Nasa is now looking for ways to bring Martian rock and soil back to Earth, allowing scientists to study the soil composition for the first time and investigate for signs of if the planet ever had life.

The Mars Program Planning Group is putting together different ways of returning a sample within the next 20 years, with Nasa potentially choosing which path to follow by next February.

One option involves 'multiple launches', a Mars Ascent Vehicle which will fire rock and soil into space, from which it can be collected and sent back to Earth.

Missions to Mars can only take place every 26 months or so, when the planets are properly aligned, and one suggestion is that a 'blast soil into space and scoop it up' mission could be staggered over separate launches.

Another option is to perform the mission in one shot - but that will put a lot of costs onto Nasa in a small amount of time, and might just be too costly for the space organisation.

Orlando Figueroa, team leader of the Mars Program Planning Group, said :'[All the options] have their pluses and minuses.

'It gives you multiple ways to look at this problem, consistent with budget concerns, consistent with opportunities for collaboration, more technology, et cetera.

'And that's what we tried to do - bring all of those options forth to NASA for consideration.'

Another suggestion is that multiple Curiosity-style rovers are sent to Mars, checking out many different sites. Then Nasa can cherry-pick the best samples, probably just from one location, and send them back.

This has the benefit of increasing the chances of finding signs of life during such an expensive project.

A manned expedition is still some way off - LifeScience repeats President Barack Obama's 2010 wish that astronauts may get to within the vicinity of Mars by the mid-2030s.

NASA's
Mars rover Curiosity held its Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) camera 
about 10.5 inches (27 centimeters) away from the top of a rock called 'Bathurst Inlet; for a set of eight images combined into this 
merged-focus view of the rock.

This context image covers an area roughly
6.5 inches by five inches (16 centimeters by 12 centimeters). Resolution 
is about 105 microns per pixel.

The Bathurst Inlet rock is
dark gray and appears to be so fine-grained that MAHLI cannot resolve 
grains or crystals in it.

This means that the grains or crystals, if 
there are any at all, are smaller than about 80 microns in size. Some 
windblown sand-sized grains or dust aggregates have accumulated on the 
surface of the rock but this surface is clean compared to, for example, 
the pebbly substrate below the rock (upper left and lower right in this 
context image).

MAHLI can do focus merging onboard. The 
full-frame versions of the eight separate images that were combined into
this view were not even returned to Earth - just the thumbnail 
versions

Merging the images onboard reduces the volume of data that 
needs to be downlinked to Earth.
