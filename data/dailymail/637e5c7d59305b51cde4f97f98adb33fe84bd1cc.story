The Football Association is to start the search for a new top executive after general secretary Alex Horne announced he is to leave the organisation at the end of January.

Horne, 42, has decided to look for a new role after overseeing a number of significant projects including the new Wembley Stadium, the national football centre at St George's Park, and securing the semi-finals and final of Euro 2020.

Horne, who took up his current post in 2010, told Press Association Sport: 'After 11 fantastic years I have decided to look for a change of direction and I will be leaving the FA at the end of January.'

There is likely to be hot demand to be his successor - FA accounts revealed that his total annual salary package was £528,000.

Horne joined the FA in 2004 as finance director and, in 2006, was appointed Wembley Stadium's managing director before becoming the FA's chief operating officer in July 2008.

He has also been a member of UEFA's competitions committee where he played a significant role in drawing up plans for staging the Euro 2020 tournament, which is being played in 13 countries across Europe.

In an FA statement Horne added: 'I am incredibly proud to have worked for the FA for over a decade in many differing roles. It's been a privilege to have played my part in the financing, build and opening of Wembley Stadium and the national football centre at St George's Park, both of which will provide a huge benefit for the game.

'More importantly, it's been a pleasure to work alongside so many devoted and talented people within The FA who are passionate about developing and improving football across the country at all levels.

Horne also played a key role at Wembley, acting as managing director of the stadium between 2006 and 2008

'This is probably the toughest decision I have made during my career. At the age of 42, the time is right for me to look for a change of direction.'

The FA Board will start the search for a successor immediately with key requirements being skill and experience in finance and marketing.

FA chairman Greg Dyke said: 'On behalf of the board and the staff at the FA, I would like to thank Alex for his dedicated leadership in a variety of roles over the last decade.

'I will now work with the board on finding his successor.'
