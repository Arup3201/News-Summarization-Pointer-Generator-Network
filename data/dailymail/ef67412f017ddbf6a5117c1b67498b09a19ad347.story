Just five months ago, Arwen the pitbull mix was found nearly blind at a hoarder's home in the freezing Mojave Desert with 88 other dogs, no shelter and little food or water.

But now, a touching film has revealed her incredible recovery - and how she is enjoying a new life with a caring owner and an affectionate brother, another pitbull named Keiko.

Arwen, 10, was found surrounded by snow and with scores of other animals after an animal hoarder contacted authorities to say she could no longer care for the 89 dogs on her land.

Teams organized by Karma Rescue traveled to the home, which was three hours from Los Angeles, where they found many dogs roaming the property without protection from the cold.

Nervous: Arwen the 10-year-old pitbull mix was found with 88 other dogs in the Mojave Desert in January

Apprehensive: When she was found, Arwen was uncertain how to interact and shied away from human touch

Those that did live inside make-shift runs were forced to endure dirty enclosures covered in feces which often mixed with the food that was thrown into their cages.

But the hoarder, who lived in the unincorporated land of the Mojave Desert, was not doing anything illegal and no charges were pressed.

Instead, the volunteers got to work building shelters for the animals until there were enough resources to ferry them to foster homes, The Pet Collective film explains.

Arwen shied away from human touch - uncertain how to deal with interactions - and volunteers noticed she was suffering a severe eye infection after exposure to the desert's brutal elements.

Long road to recovery: When Arwen was taken from the desert, right, she was suffering severely infected eyes, left, after being exposed to such brutal elements. She underwent surgery to remove scar tissue

Images show that her eyes were 
entirely bloodshot and inflamed, leaving the animal in pain and 
convincing volunteers that if she had been found any later, she would 
have surely been blind.

A 
volunteer named Alex transported her and other dogs to a boarding 
facility - but on the way, another worker suggested that Alex could 
provide a foster home.

Alex agreed - but soon welcomed Arwen into her home full time.

She
 took her to the vet and the animal, whose condition was far worse than 
originally thought, underwent eye surgery to remove inflamed tissue - 
the size of cherries - from her eyes.

Other
 afflictions revealed Arwen's former life; she had hardly any teeth 
after gnawing at the hoarder's fence, and she nervously paced Alex's 
home in circles resembling the shape of her previous home.

Suffering: Arwen has hardly any teeth after years of gnawing at the fence at the Mojave Desert site

Recovery: She was taken home by one of the volunteers and slowly began to get used to her new life

Settling in: A video reveals her happy at her new home after she underwent eye surgery

'She had some behaviors that were very typical of dogs that have been unsocialized, in confinement, neglected,' Alex said. 'She walked in circles constantly.

'Her body was deteriorating. Had Karma Rescue not intervened and provided medical assistance I'm sure she would either be dead or in constant pain.'

But after attention from Alex and becoming more comfortable in her new home, the pacing became less and her eyes began to heal.

She was also nurtured by Alex's other pit bull, Keiko - and in no time became a 'perfect' dog, Alex told the Pet Collective.

Loved: She is pictured with her new owner, Alex, who called her affectionate - and 'the perfect dog'

At home: The 10-year-old dog has also found a friend in Alex's other boisterous pitbull, Keiko, right

Forgiving: Even though she was so poorly treated in the past, Arwen now loves humans, Alex said

All smiles: Alex said that even though Arwen had been so apprehensive, rescue dogs really do recover

'Animals like Arwen, they really do make a full recovery,' she said. 'She doesn't bear any grudge against people. She really, really loves being around people even though they were so bad to her to begin with.

'I'd always heard people say their dogs were perfect and once Arwen recovered she turned into this dog that is absolutely reliable, confident, affectionate.

'I thought I had had good dogs before but now I know what a perfect dog is.'
