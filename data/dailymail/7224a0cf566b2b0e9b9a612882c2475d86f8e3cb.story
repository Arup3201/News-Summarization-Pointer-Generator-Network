A schoolboy is to make his debut in a Hollywood film, but he needn't worry if his acting skills are a little rigid - he will appear as a fibreglass figure of a boy soldier.

Artist Tristan Schoonrad created his life-size boy soldier with grenade and tin helmet using moulds taken of his nephew Kai when he was aged seven.

Now aged 11, Kai is set to see his arty incarnation star on the big screen with the sculpture set to feature in Kick Ass 2 which will be released later this summer.

The striking figure had already proved a
hit with actor Brad Pitt requesting his own personal copy of the 
artwork after working on a film with Tristan and Blur front man Damon 
Albarn also owning a version.

Tristan, 33, who has been working in the film industry since he was 15, spent a painstaking two months taking the moulds of Kai's arms, legs, torso and head before assembling the figure.

Taking accurate moulds of the seven year old was a tricky task as Kai had to sit completely still, particularly for the facial mould.

But according to Tristan, from Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, Kai was the model professional throughout the work.

Talented: Artist Tristan Schoonrad, who created the Boy Soldier sculpture from a life cast of his nephew Kai

He said: 'My brother was kind enough to let me borrow Kai for these models and he was great.

'When I was taking a mould of the face he had to be so still and he kept the same facial expression the whole time.

'Kai was a bit indifferent about doing it at first. I think he would prefer to be out playing football or something.

'The art work itself has done really well but I don’t quite make enough to live on just yet.'

Versions of the boy soldier usually fetch around £7,000 a time.

Tristan found his way into the film industry following in his father John's footsteps - he worked at Elstree Studios when Tristan was growing up.

On visits to the studio with his father, Tristan found his way on to such film sets as Indiana Jones: The Raiders of the Lost Ark and Star Wars: Return of the Jedi.

Now, Tristan, John and brother Robin all work for Lifecast Ltd, the family firm.

Tristan's own work, mainly in special effects, make up and prosthetics, has seen him work on films such as Rambo, Troy, the Harry Potter films and Gladiator.

His focus shifted slightly from the world of film to the art world when a friend suggested he exhibit some of his work.

He said:  'I have been doing mould making and special effects work since I was 15 because that is what my Dad has always done.

'I had begun to construct models similar to these for work but then about three years ago one of my friends said I should put it up in her art show so I did.'

Some of Tristan's work was featured on a plinth in Parliament Square in 2011.
