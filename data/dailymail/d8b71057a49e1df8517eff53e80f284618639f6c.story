This was the scene of carnage when a man's ex-girlfriend spotted him walking with his new love for an evening stroll - and decided to make the separation permanent by running him and his new girlfriend over.

Unfortunately the couple were also walking on a pavement packed with other people, leaving dozens injured as the Chinese-manufactured BYD car smashed through a concrete pillar and mounted the curb.

According to police the female driver, who they named as Jiao T'an, 28, was an ex-girlfriend of Chen Wei, 29, and although they had broken up three years earlier, they had maintained a friendship and she had apparently hoped they would eventually get back together. 

A man's ex-girlfriend spotted him walking with his new love for an evening stroll - and decided to make the separation permanent by running him and his new girlfriend over in the Chinese city of Longquan

Scorned: Dozens were injured when the woman ploughed into the crowds on the busy pavement

But that hope was dashed when she spotted him by chance walking with his new girlfriend.

According to eyewitness Yue Yan Shih, who narrowly missed being hit herself, the car had at first stopped on the street in the city of Longquan, in eastern China's Zhejiang Province, and a woman leaned out and started shouting at a man on the pavement.

Yue said: 'She was angry about something because she was really raising her voice, but the man turned his back on her and walked off with another girl.

'But he hadn't got very far when the driver suddenly accelerated forward and deliberately drove at him and the other young woman.'

The couple had broken up three years earlier, but had maintained a friendship and she had apparently hoped they would eventually get back together

Several people were treated at the scene with cuts and bruises and Jiao was arrested by police

The car, which also smashed into a black BMW, was badly damaged and towed away

She added: 'It was carnage, there were people lying around everywhere and somebody pulled open the door and dragged the driver out.

'She was screaming and shouting that she hoped she had got him and his stupid girlfriend and that it was all his fault.'

Several people were treated at the scene with cuts and bruises and Jiao was arrested by police.

In total five people including the couple she had been targeting were hospitalised, although police believe they will all make a full recovery.
