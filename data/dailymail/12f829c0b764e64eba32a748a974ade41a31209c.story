A toddler who died after months of abuse from his ‘monster’ mother was failed repeatedly by social workers.

Two-year-old Keanu Williams, who was known to police and children’s services, was beaten to death by Rebecca Shuttleworth.

He had 37 injuries including bite marks, a fractured skull and a fist-sized tear in his stomach.

He was hit repeatedly with a stick or rod over 48 hours and died of internal bleeding, a post-mortem examination found.

Paramedics discovered his body at the 
home of Shuttleworth’s then boyfriend, Luke Southerton, 32.

A review has
 begun into why social workers failed to spot the abuse.

Keanu’s injuries were not ‘isolated’ but part of a long chain of abuse by his mother, who now faces life behind bars.

Yet Shuttleworth, 25, had duped officials into thinking she was ‘caring and competent’.

It adds to questions about children’s 
services at Labour-run Birmingham City Council, rated ‘inadequate’ since
 2009 after deaths of children known to social workers.

Cases include 
that of seven-year-old Khyra Ishaq, starved to death in 2008.

Last month the department was labelled ‘utter chaos’ by members of its own watchdog.

Yesterday Jane Held, head of the 
Birmingham Safeguarding Children Board, which is reviewing Keanu’s 
death, said social services, medics and police ‘missed a significant 
number of opportunities to intervene’.

Birmingham Crown Court heard that Shuttleworth had ‘resented’ Keanu virtually from his birth in 2008.

Shuttleworth, who was living with 
Keanu’s father in Torquay, Devon, saw the child as an ‘obstruction to 
living her life as she wanted’, the jury was told.

Prosecutor Christopher Hotten QC said 
she spent much of her childhood in care as her alcoholic mother 
struggled to cope, giving her ‘considerable experience of the care 
system’.

Keanu Williams' family has been 'torn apart' by his death, according to his aunt.

Angela Shuttleworth, 26, Rebecca Shuttleworth's sister, said the death of the toddler who was known in the family as Kiwi had left 'a gaping hole in our lives'.

In a statement she said: 'Keanu was an amazing little boy who had developed a real personality.

'He was full of life and loved playing with his siblings and cousins. He enjoyed all his toys and would empty the toy box every time he came to play, but he especially loved Iggle Piggle from (children's television programme) In The Night Garden .

'Kiwi also loved food - he ate everything and was hungry all the time.'

She added: 'Since the tragic death of Kiwi, we haven't been able to grieve or say goodbye to him properly.

'The whole family has been torn apart by this and his death has left a gaping hole in our lives.

'We hope now this is over we can lay Kiwi to rest and begin to have some closure.'

Following Keanu’s birth she received 
‘extensive’ support from health and social workers, posing as an 
‘attentive’ mother at parenting classes.

She moved back to her home city of Birmingham when Keanu was 15 months old, starting a relationship with Southerton.

Mr Hotten said Shuttleworth used her 
knowledge of the care system to ‘manipulate social workers, teachers, 
doctors and care professionals to believe that she was a competent and 
caring mother’.

She told staff at the child’s nursery his bruises came 
from bumps or falls.

In December 2010, she took Keanu to hospital with burned feet, which she claimed came from a radiator beside his bed.

She was told police would inspect her home, and texted Southerton to make sure their stories matched up.

A month later, paramedics found the 
boy dead at the flat in the deprived Ward End suburb.

The couple had 
dialled 999, claiming Keanu had had a heart attack.

Mr Hotten told the 
jury Shuttleworth hoped he would ‘get better’ and only called 999 when 
she realised it was hopeless.

Detective Chief Inspector Caroline 
Marsh, who led the investigation for West Midlands Police, said: ‘In the
 past, I have described her as a monster and perhaps I would stand by 
that.’

The force would not comment on its prior involvement in the case because of the review.

Southerton was cleared of murder, 
manslaughter and causing or allowing the death, but convicted of cruelty
 yesterday after a six-month trial.

Shuttleworth, who was convicted of four counts of child cruelty as well as murder, will be sentenced alongside him today.

She has been on bail throughout the case and attended court with a woman she was heard to describe as her ‘partner’.
