The lives of British agents may have been put at risk by a Guardian journalist’s possession of top-secret documents stolen from the US  government, a senior Cabinet adviser has warned.

Documents seized from the reporter’s boyfriend, David Miranda, were so sensitive that agents have since had to be moved to protect their lives.

Oliver Robbins, deputy national security adviser at the Cabinet Office, went on the record to warn that ‘lives may be put at risk’ if the documents fall in to the wrong hands.

Court papers released yesterday also 
revealed the incredibly lax security used around the material, with Mr 
Miranda apparently carrying a password for some of the computer 
documents written on a scrap of paper.

Security
sources also said that, as a result of the theft, codes for tens of 
thousands of sensitive documents have had to be changed.

Details
of the chaos caused at the highest levels of Britain’s security and 
intelligence agencies by the leaks emerged in official court submissions
about material seized from Mr Miranda, the boyfriend of Guardian 
journalist Glenn Greenwald.

Mr
Miranda, 28, who is Brazilian, was detained at Heathrow on August 18 as
he passed through the airport on his way from Berlin to Rio.

He
was found to be carrying nine hard disks and memory sticks including 
secret files leaked by former CIA analyst Edward Snowden, and was 
questioned for nine hours before being released.

Mr Miranda’s detention under terrorism powers provoked outrage from civil liberties groups.

But
the newspaper’s initial story described him only as Mr Greenwald’s 
boyfriend, and made no mention of the fact that he was carrying secret 
material or that the Guardian was paying for his flights.

Despite
only decrypting one third of the material, police have already 
discovered 58,000 classified documents, many marked secret or top 
secret.

In a statement to 
the High Court, Mr Robbins said the material was likely to contain 
details of secret techniques used to prevent terror attacks, personal 
data about agents at home and abroad and ‘other intelligence activities 
vital to UK national security’.

The
release of the information could pose a ‘direct threat to the life of 
UK government employees’, as well as threaten the lives of their 
families.

Mr Robbins warned
the judges – who granted additional powers to the police to examine the
classified material – that the information that had been decrypted ‘has
had a direct impact on decisions taken in regard to staff deployments 
and is therefore impacting operational effectiveness’.

He
wrote: ‘The material seized is highly likely to describe techniques 
which have been crucial in life-saving counter-terrorism operations, and
other intelligence activities vital to UK national security. The 
compromise of these methods would do serious damage to UK national 
security, and ultimately risk lives.’

He added: ‘A particular concern for HMG is the possibility that the identity of a UK intelligence officer might be revealed.’

GCHQ,
the Government’s communications headquarters, and the police are using a
large amount of resources to decrypt and process the material, Mr 
Robbins said.

He warned of 
the urgent need to identify what other material is on the hard drives 
‘to assess the risks to sensitive intelligence sources and methods, and 
the threat to intelligence agency staff should their identities or 
details of their operational tradecraft be obtained by hostile actors’.

Mr
Robbins said the Guardian’s publication of details from the documents 
had already caused ‘real and serious damage’ to national security.

Alan Rusbridger, the editor of  the Guardian, branded his claims ‘unsubstantiated and inaccurate’.

He
said: ‘The Guardian took every decision on what to publish very slowly 
and very carefully and when we met with government officials in July 
they acknowledged that we had displayed a “responsible” attitude.

‘The
Government’s behaviour does not match their rhetoric in trying to 
justify and exploit this dismaying blurring of terrorism and 
journalism.’
