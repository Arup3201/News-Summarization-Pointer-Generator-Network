A Canadian fisherman made the most extraordinary catch of his life when he spotted a bald eagle in distress floating in the water and he used a net to rescue the stricken bird.

Don Dunbar, who was fishing off the coast of Nanoose Bay on Vancouver Island, saw the exhausted eagle and decided to help.  

The bird was in serious difficulty as it was unable to fly and it was struggling to stay afloat. 

During the video the bird's wings are waterlogged and the recreational fisherman decides it would be a good idea to let it dry off on his boat.

As he uses a fishing net to rescue the bird, it looks helplessly weak and unable to move.

The man can be heard saying, 'There you go, were you a little tired? What are we going to do with you now?'

Conscious: The bald eagle looks up at the fisherman intermittently during the rescue operation

The affable fisherman then enables the eagle to dry off for a few minutes and says, 'Welcome aboard buddy. Let's get you in the sun, so you can warm up and dry out a bit ..then you can fly away if you choose.'

A few minutes later the bald eagle makes an effort to fly away but its waterlogged wings hinder his movement and  it falls to the ground before it manages to take flight.

According to ctvnews.com when Mr Dunbar later arrived at the mainland the bald eagle was brought to a Wildlife Rescue refuge in Delta, British Colombia where the bird is currently being treated for an infection and malnutrition.

Wings: The bald eagle then spreads its wings but they are drenched and it is unable to fly
