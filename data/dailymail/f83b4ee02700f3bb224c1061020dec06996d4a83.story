Long flight: British racing pigeons are being shipped to China

The  waning sport of pigeon  racing has received a welcome financial boost from China, where birds race for up to £1million in prizes.

Fanciers from the Far East are prepared to pay thousands of pounds for British racing birds  as more than 300,000 affluent  Chinese take up the hobby.

The growing interest is in stark contrast to the UK, where the hobby is in sharp decline.

But with more than 300,000 fanciers in China demand for winning British birds is high.

The record prize for a British bird was reached by Champion Treble Six, nicknamed the Banker because of its winning record, to a Chinese buyer for breeding for £16,000 in 2011.

This year a bird named Bolt, after Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, was sold to a Chinese businessman for £260,000, by a Belgian fancier.

While gambling is illegal pigeon races in China attract large bets and prizes totalling £3million. In some races the winning bird earns his owner £1million.

Pigeon racing in China can be traced back to the Ming dynasty of the 14th century.

The sport was banned as too capitalist during the Cultural Revolution but has rebounded since the ban was quietly lifted a few years ago.

Now the country's emerging middle class has taken to the sport with huge interest, making fast birds important status symbols which attract higher prices than in Britain.

The Royal Pigeon Racing Association (RPRA) has now commissioned a report to look into ways of exploit the market further.

It hopes that increased opportunities for British fanciers will also lead to a resurgence in the sport in the UK too.

Stewart Wardrop, RPRA general manager, said: 'We're just waking up to the potential and the fact it could be a big business for us. The Chinese, like in so many areas, are trying to acquire the best things available.'

The RPRA has recruited a Mandarin speaker to build up contacts in the Far East, it appears on Chinese websites and social media.

The association even has plans to launch a Mandarin version of its journal British Homing World.

There are now some 42,000 pigeon racers in Britain, less than half the 100,000 of the figure in the sport's heyday in the late 1960's, with the figure falling by about five per cent a year.

However the RPRA claims the sport generates £130million a year for the economy and hopes trade with China could help pigeons bring even more money home.
