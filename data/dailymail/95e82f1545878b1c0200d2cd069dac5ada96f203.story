Three close-knit brothers, who helped care for their aunt as she battled with breast cancer, will be the first people in the world to trial wearable payment technology.

Jackson, 26, Julian, 34, and Jonas Tobias, 23, will roam Sydney CBD collecting donations for the National Breast Cancer Foundation (NBCF) while wearing pink ties – with a twist.

The ties, which have been created by technology company Brother, have been fitted with a cable that runs through the middle of the accessory and connects to an android device.

Donors can tap their credit card directly onto a point on the tie which will deduct $10 that will be sent directly to the NBCF while a receipt is issued by the donor's bank.

'For a cashless society, the ties are perfect and $10 goes a long way,' Jonas Tobias told Daily Mail Australia.

'Everyone has, at one stage, had to deal with people coming up and asking for money, and most people are happy to donate, but not a lot of people carry cash on them.

'This way they can just use their card and they can be on their merry way in just a couple of seconds.'

The Sydney brothers were inspired to get involved in the Brother For Sisters campaign after helping their aunt Melissa (pictured with her husband) through her own battle with breast cancer 

For Jonas and his brothers, breast cancer is an illness that is very close to home.

Their aunt Melissa, 43, was diagnosed with the illness in late 2011 and endured months of chemotherapy and a double mastectomy until she was finally cleared of the illness in 2013.

'It was pretty strange to find out about at first. She is a real trooper – you can't find a more upbeat person on this planet,' Jonas said of his aunt.

'There were some rough days, but in the end, she was a lot stronger than we were.

The ties that the Tobias brothers will wear have been fitted with a cable that runs through the middle of the accessory and connects to an android device, allowing people to donate by tapping their credit cards to the accessory

The charity is also alternatively selling pink ties for $20 during the campaign, with all money raised being used to help fund research into the prevention, detection and treatment of breast cancer

'For us, it was just kind of helping her through the recovery. Our mum, another aunt and our grandma gave up a lot of their time to be with her so we just cooked meals and kept their lives as regular as possible, because at the time one of Melissa's daughters was at school and the other had just started.

'We didn't want to disrupt their routine and wanted to take the pressure of Melissa.'

All the money raised during the Brother For Sisters campaign will be used to help fund research into the prevention, detection and treatment of breast cancer, according to the NBCF.

The charity is also selling pink ties for $20 during the campaign. 

While the Near Field Communication technology fitted ties have been developed specifically for the NBCF, the invention has plenty of opportunity to expand into other charities in the future as well.
