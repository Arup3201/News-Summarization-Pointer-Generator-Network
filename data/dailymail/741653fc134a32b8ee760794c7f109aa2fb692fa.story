It's been four months since reports of a reversible USB plug started doing the rounds, and the project just took a step forward as images of the cable surfaced online.

The artist's renderings, created by Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn, show what the new cables will look like, and how the ports on the side of electronic devices are set to change.

Called the USB Type-C connector, it has been designed for use with thinner, sleeker devices, such as tablets and ultrabooks, and solves the annoying problem of inserting drives the wrong way up.  

The images, pictured, created by Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn, show what the new reversible cables could look like. The Type-C connector is built on existing USB 3.1 and USB 2.0 technologies. Captions on the images state they are 'artist renderings courtesy of Foxconn' and 'final designs are subject to change'

The USB Type-C connector has been 
designed for use with thinner, sleeker devices, such as tablets and 
ultrabooks.

It is being built on existing USB 3.1 and USB 2.0 technologies.

The plug is smaller than current laptop connectors, and more closely resembles the size of the current Micro USB.

Crucially, it will be reversible meaning it will work whichever way it is plugged in.

This is similar to how Apple's Lightning connector works.

The USB 2.0 specification was released in 2000 and became the standard by the end of 2001, followed by USB 3.0 in 2008, and 3.1 in July 2013.

Apple uses its own Lightning Connector on newer models of iPhone and iPads, which can be inserted either way up.

The Type-C connector will work in a similar way, while resembling the size of the current Micro USB plug. 

According to the USB 3.0 Promoter Group, the Type-C will be ‘the only connector one will need across all devices.’

Crucially, however, as the new design is different to the current versions of USB plugs, users of older computing equipment will need an adapter to use the new plugs.

Brad Saunders, chairman of the promoter group, said the plug is being developed ‘to help enable thinner and sleeker product designs, enhance usability and provide a growth path for performance enhancements for future versions of USB.'

The USB 2.0 specification was released in 2000 and became standard by the end of 2001, followed by USB 3.0 in 2008, and 3.1 in July 2013. These plugs have been criticised because they can only be inserted one way up

The design and full specifications have not been released yet, but the USB Implementers Forum claimed the images reflect its preferred design.

The final design is expected to be released by the summer.

Alex
 Peleg of Intel said his company ‘is excited to see the development of 
the new thin Type-C connector as it will enable an entirely new super-thin class of devices from phones to tablets, to 2-in-1s, to laptops to 
desktops and a multitude of other more specific usage devices.’
