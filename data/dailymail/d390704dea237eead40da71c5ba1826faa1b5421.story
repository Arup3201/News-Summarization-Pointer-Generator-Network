Moved on: Suzy Miller is happy as a divorcee

The day of the wedding was perfect: the sun shone, the bride looked radiant and the food and drink flowed. Posing with my three children and their father for the photos, I couldn't have felt more delighted.

Except, unlike me, Chris wasn't there as a guest. He was the groom.

Given that we'd split four years earlier after he left - nearly destroying me in the process - it seems incredible I was invited to his nuptials, and that I'd even wanted to attend.

It was important for me to be there because I strongly believe the best way forward for scorned exes - particularly when there are children involved - is not revenge, but to accept every part of an ex's new life without complaint. That includes his new partner.

When our ten-year relationship ended, I could never have imagined attending Chris's wedding, nor giving him his own set of keys to my new family home so he could pop in.

Not when he had betrayed my trust in such a devastating way.

Until that point, Chris was my whole life. We'd met in our late 20s, and within a few months, had moved in together and were planning a family.

After four years, we had our first child, our daughter Cydney. Joseph and Henry followed.

We rarely argued. He worked hard as a factory manager to provide for us, and my career as a script editor in the film industry dwindled when our third child came along, so I became increasingly dependent upon him financially and emotionally. 

I remember thinking: 'If he ever left me it would be like someone cutting off my right arm'. Little did I know how much of a premonition that was.

One night in 2003, Chris announced he wanted to leave me and our children, then aged six, four and 18 months - and my world came crashing down.

He'd sobbed on my shoulder as he told me he'd been having a fling with a local woman, a relationship which had now ended. And now we'd probably have to sell our home.

I realised there was no future for us as a couple and, for the first time, contemplated a terrifying future as a single mother with no home and a career long past. Worst of all, I was about to turn 40. Not much of 'a catch' for any new man either.

Surely, if anyone should be in floods of tears it should be me? But at the time I was too angry and broken to cry. I was furious. I was hurt and ashamed. My self-esteem was gone.

The aftermath of that catastrophic night was horrendous. At first, I waded through the days in a state of complete shock.

First family: Suzy and Chris and their three children when they were still together

Then the anger and emotional pain started to take hold. I moved into a rented house and would cry and shout at him down the phone, and avoid conversations when we swapped the kids over at weekends.

But very quickly I realised I had to make a choice about how to deal with what had happened, or it was going to eat up my life and harm the children into the bargain.

I could choose to let my bitterness and rage rule my thinking - and become one of those angry women who are always slagging off their ex and never seem to find any real joy in life any more.

Or, I could put on a brave face and do what was right for the children while my soul slowly died inside. But I knew that by keeping anger and hurt hidden, it would eventually find its way out in the form of illness or depression.

Or might there be a third way?

But what was this third way? How could I possibly build a healthy relationship to co-parent children with someone who had metaphorically ripped out my heart, then carved it up with a chainsaw for good measure?

Although I was livid with what he'd done, I knew that punishing him was not going to help anyone. Particularly our children. After all, they were half of both of us. If I said bad things about their dad that meant I was also attacking half the child.

One day, fighting back the desire to vent my anger, I sat Chris down and said: 'Our children don't care who's done what; they don't judge us. All they care about is how we deal with this from now on. They are learning from us how to manage relationships - we need to show them a better way.'

He went quiet and I knew that through his grief, confusion and guilt he understood what I was saying. But it all hinged on me finding a way to forgive and move on.

So I put myself on what I can only describe as a crash course on how to see myself not as a victim, but as a woman blessed with a chance to start again.

Second wife: Chris is now married to Marilyn and Suzy is happy for them

I may not have chosen for my family to be broken up in such a painful way, but I realised that the choice of how I dealt with the situation was mine. It was tough at times. I had to accept some responsibility for what had happened. Instead of hating my beloved man for throwing away our relationship for a meaningless fling, I tried to see things from his point of view.

Clearly, the stress of supporting us all was huge. He was deeply unhappy and just because we had made three beautiful babies together didn't mean he had to spend the rest of his life with me.

Painfully, I began to see that outside of the children, Chris and I had very little in common.

I devoured every self-help book friends could lend me, ignored negative comments and 'advice' about my ex (many friends deemed my attitude 'weird') and determined to transform myself from bitter single mother to someone free to have fun again.

Within a few years, I had been on some wonderful dates and realised I could actually enjoy sex more in my 40s than when I was in my 20s. Because I wasn't bitter about the past and refused to believe all men were untrustworthy, I was complimented on being easy to date.

I launched a website, the Alternative Divorce Guide, to show couples there is a better way to manage break-ups. I also set up a directory where they could find mediators, collaborative lawyers and counsellors.

Amicable split: Suzy, Chris and their children pose for a family photo on his wedding day to Marilyn

I danced joyfully at parties and made new friends.

Of course, it bothered me when Chris announced he was seeing Marilyn, a beautiful young woman 20 years my junior. And there was a flash of jealousy but, after getting over the initial strangeness of it all, she and I got along brilliantly. I genuinely adored my children's new stepmother.

I was heartened when she confided her relief that an angry divorce like that of her parents was not something my - now our - children would have to suffer. When they married, four years after Chris and I split, my friends considered it beyond bizarre that I wanted to go to the wedding. I was delighted to be invited.

Wasn't this what I'd set out to achieve? This was surely how the perfect female ex behaved.

As the photos were taken, on Brighton beach, the photographer turned to Chris, the children and me and asked us to gather for a photograph.

I could sense people around us were clearly uncomfortable with the line-up and there were a few double-takes. And even I took some persuading.

But the photographer insisted. He could see that the kids and I were still very important to Chris, and that it was only right to have a family photo of us at the wedding.

Unlikely alliance: Suzy with her ex husband's new wife, Marilyn, who she gets on with famously

And I'm so grateful he did, as I look back at that photo with real pride now.

I don't think I'd feel the same if instead I'd chosen to play the blame game.

Chris and I have three perfectly well-balanced children who do not feel torn between warring parents. They live with me, but stay with him and his new wife frequently and Chris visits them at my house often.

When I read about the terrible increase in the numbers of children self-harming due to the stress of divorce, I thank God that I had it in me to be magnanimous and forgive. To put the needs of my children first.

So, if you are battling through a break-up and want to build a new and healthy relationship with your ex, don't listen to the people who raise their eyebrows when you tell them you are doing breakfast for the whole family on Christmas morning - including your ex and his new wife.

Or, if they think it's strange that your ex is building you a new kitchen in his rare moments of spare time, because he knows that will make life much easier for you as a mum.

What's so wrong with being nice to your ex?

It's hard to be a perfect wife, even harder to be a perfect ex - but the rewards are beyond measure.
