It was billed as ‘the most amazing Christmas experience that planet Earth has ever seen’, complete with an enchanted forest and unforgettable visit to Santa’s grotto.

But the ‘Magical Journey’ winter wonderland attraction was shut after just one day – after rude staff, a sweary Father Christmas and elves that ‘sat around smoking’ left children in tears.

More than a thousand parents complained about the experience at the Belfry Golf Club in Warwickshire, which costs upwards of £50 for a family of three.

The Magical Journey in Warwickshire closed on Sunday after just one day following complaints by parents about long queues, rude staff and cheap toys at the attraction, created by designer Laurence Llewlyn-Bowen

The ride was closed today as organisers said they needed to make improvements to the experience

The attraction, designed by flamboyant TV presenter Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen, was deemed ‘tacky’ and ‘unsafe’ by families, who complained of cheap presents, rubbish everywhere and no decorations or festive music.

Others raised health and safety fears after spotting elves having to push a ‘faulty Father Christmas Express train’ up a hill. Parents also claimed some of the Father Christmases swore, were ‘grumpy’ or ‘far too skinny to be believable’.

Bosses were forced to close the attraction yesterday morning following the barrage of complaints.

The Magical Journey – the latest in a long line of Christmas attractions which fail to live up to expectations – was sold to parents as a ‘magnificent immersive theatrical version’ of Santa’s grotto.

At its media launch on Thursday, interior designer Mr Llewelyn-Bowen boasted that it would be ‘perfect’ and that a visit to Santa would ‘never be the same again’.

Parents, however, were quick to disagree. Melanie Cooke Brzonkalik, 46, who was one of the first to visit the attraction when it opened at 10am on Saturday, said: ‘It shatters the magic somewhat straight away when you see elves standing around smoking and moaning that they were working until 9pm.’

She paid £140 for tickets and travel from Gloucester – a three-hour round trip – with her children Noah, five, Tegan, 13, and Sam, 15.

She wrote on Facebook: ‘Disappointed and shocked that someone I respected would think this debacle was good enough.

‘It was a complete joke ... half-finished, not magical in any way, workmen everywhere, tacky, unfinished sets, no snow – just bags of it stacked up at the entrance!’

The site was closed after complaints that the Father Christmas express train broke down during the day

Organisers said the attraction should not have delayed its opening because of the rain affecting preparations

Parents reported that the winter express train, to Santa's grotto, broke down during the first day it was open

Organisers said the Magical Journey would be closed for three days and heavy rain had affected preparations

The Magical Journey remained closed today following complaints about smoking elves and poor decorations

What disgruntled visitors are saying online: 

Lindsay Adele: ‘Best train journey ever in the whole world? A tractor pulling a gloried golf buggy in my opinion isn’t a train ride.’

Rich Day: ‘I had to explain to my kid that Santa doesn’t usually smoke and drink, and neither will he use foul language when he visits us on Xmas eve.’

Simone Freeman: ‘Father Christmas asked my daughter if she wanted the ripped present or squashed one!’

Natalie Craig: ‘It has definitely been falsely advertised. The journey was nothing like it was advertised and the staff were rude twice to me and my son.’

Caroline Samuel: ‘My youngest has been counting down the days to go ... had a lot of tears this morning.’

Mother of two Clarissa Morrall, 24, travelled to the attraction from Leicester. 

Her four-year-old daughter, Leraya, was given an unwrapped baby’s rattle as her gift from Santa.

Miss Morrall, a nursery nurse, added: ‘It’s not magical and so overpriced. They make you spend ages walking around outside trying to find a “lost reindeer” then at the end you don’t find it.’

Tickets cost between £10 and £15 for adults, and £17.50 and £22.50 for children depending on what day of the week they visit.

Paul Dolan, the event’s director, apologised and admitted it had experienced ‘teething problems’.

He confirmed it would remain shut until Wednesday so the team could ‘implement improvements’.

He added that work on the attraction had been ‘severely hampered by torrential rain’ and denied that the elves had been smoking.
