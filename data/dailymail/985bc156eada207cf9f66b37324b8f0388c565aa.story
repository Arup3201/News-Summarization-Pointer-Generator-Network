Smoking chimneys and garish gasometers invade the skyline. The backdrop is poignant if not pretty, for here, amid the industrial heartland of the Ruhr Valley, rumbles one of the talent factories responsible for powering Germany to World Cup success.

This is the academy of Schalke 04, once home to Manuel Neuer, Benedikt Howedes, Julian Draxler and Mesut Ozil - more than £100million’s worth of talent and a key part of the squad in Brazil.

And here’s the bad news, at least from an England perspective - there is more to come.

Captain Philipp Lahm, record goalscorer Miroslav Klose and defender Per Mertesacker may have retired since their crowning night in Rio, but on Sunday evening in Dortmund a golden generation — this lot have the medals to support that moniker — begin their quest for continental dominance when their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign opens against Scotland.

Schalke, unsurprisingly, are ready to restock the national team: Leon Goretzka, 19, and Max Meyer, 18, have already been capped.

So what is their secret formula? Forget football for a moment; it is the chemistry of character, maturity, education and trust which is key in Gelsenkirchen.

Oliver Ruhnert, academy director, points first to his head and only later to his feet when asked what makes a world champion footballer, and he should know.

‘Mentality is the first thing we look for,’ he says, having already agreed that Germany’s squad in Brazil was psychologically superior to the rest. ‘Any of our scouts know the information we want above all else. What is his mentality? What is he doing when the team are losing? How do his team-mates react to him?

‘The second step is what they can do with their feet. There have been players who would make our team better, for sure, but in the future they would have been a black sheep. This is especially important for Schalke, it is more than technical skills.’

Earlier in the day an Under-16 match is watched by upwards of 500 spectators, many enjoying a beer and a bockwurst - traditional German sausage - laid on by the club.

Ruhnert believes early exposure to crowds is one of the reasons why Germany’s players invite the amplified pressure of a major tournament, whereas England’s boys shy away on the international stage.

‘I visited Chelsea, Man City, Man United — all the facilities are so unbelievable and they are better than here. The pitches are like golf greens,’ he says.

‘But maybe the difference is mentality and maturity. When I was there I thought to myself, “Where are the spectators?” Some of the games I went to they were not allowed to watch. Why the secret?

But the complex and those behind the development of youth players have many reasons to be proud

‘I think players need to feel pressure. In England, perhaps they don’t. In Germany, we want to treat our players like men from a young age and encourage them to take responsibility.’

On the subject of England, Ruhnert offers: ‘I think the one thing which has to change is the number of foreign players in the Premier League. Before Euro 2000 (when Germany suffered an embarrassing exit at the group stage) it was the same here, you could not find a German centre-forward in the Bundesliga.

‘But after 2000 we changed everything, from top to bottom.’

One innovation was education. Within the grounds of the academy is the Gesamtschule Berger Feld, a partial boarding school which now boasts a quartet of World Cup winners as alumni, as well as several of the current first team who came third in the Bundesliga last season.

But it is not just about academic grades. Schalke are strict on their youngsters absorbing the history of the club. Their nickname - Die Knappen - means The Miners, the team having originally been made up of workers from the nearby coalmine. Indeed, the tunnel at the 79,000-capacity Veltins Arena has been transformed to resemble their forefathers’ underground workplace.

‘Everybody always asks me, “Why are you so successful?”’ laughs Ruhnert, a coach since his twenties. He is now 41 and one of Germany’s most respected voices on youth football.

‘Of course, you need excellent scouts and coaches and a little bit of luck. But I believe in making small differences.

‘One of them, for us, is that we believe it is very important to tell the players the history of Schalke, to have this in the mind, to always have the spirit of Schalke in the heart. That breeds loyalty and passion. Draxler has been here since he was nine, Benni (Howedes) also. They know the club and have desire for it. The reference to the miners reminds them of the hard work needed to succeed.’

There is also a more recent reminder of the club’s proud history just beyond the academy, where a retro Eighties floodlight towers above a crumbling stadium. That is the old Parkstadion, a host venue at Euro 88 and scene of West Germany’s 2-0 win over Denmark, with Jurgen Klinsmann and Olaf Thon the scorers.

Club spirit: Draxler has been part of the Schalke system since he was nine years old

Thon, until Neuer and Co, was perhaps the most famous graduate of Schalke’s youth system. As I chat with Ruhnert, Thon, now 48, is himself just a few hundred yards away at an open day for supporters where more than 100,000 have gathered to meet stars past and present. Everywhere there is evidence of togetherness, community and spirit, a club safeguarding its future.

To that end, finding talent is the continual challenge facing Ruhnert and his team of scouts. So where do they unearth their gems? A lot closer than you would perhaps think. Neuer and Ozil were born in Gelsenkirchen, Draxler in the bordering city of Gladbeck and Howedes just 20 miles away in Haltern.

There is no need for South American superscouts, as Ruhnert explains: ‘Up to 13 [years old] we only go 20 kilometres around. Up to 15 we extend to our region, which includes 16 million people. It must be possible to find good players in that area, and that is our philosophy here. I say to my scouts, “Please look here first”.

‘After 15 we might start looking abroad. But look at the players we are successful with, most are from Germany and from very close to Gelsenkirchen.

‘One of our scouts is 62 and he only looks out for players between nine and 12 – but he has an unbelievable eye, the best. If he comes to me and says he likes a player, he is never wrong.

‘And we have more coming through now: Max Meyer, Leon Goretzka and Leroy Sane — watch out for them, they are waiting to be the next stars, for Schalke and the national side.’

For while the furnaces of the Ruhr Valley continue to blaze, a diamond is always being mined nearby.

Manuel Neuer (28 years old, 203 apps for Schalke before £18m move to Bayern Munich in 2011)

‘Manu is great, I like him so much. At 16 the coaches said he was too small, but he grew 20cm and is now the best goalkeeper in the world. He is someone who always had the mentality to make it to the very top.’

Benedikt Howedes (26 years old, 236 apps/18 goals, still at the club)

‘Benni played on the left side in the World Cup. He had never done that before, that is unbelievable. He is not so fast or good with the ball but he is so intelligent. So you can see, there are different ways to become a professional.’

Julian Draxler (20 years old, 150 apps/27 goals, still at club)

‘There is always speculation about Julian’s future but it is better for him to stay here. He needs time. He made his debut at 16 and there was a lot of hype. But he had a dip also when he was younger. We keep faith with our players though and now he has the chance to be a fantastic player.’

Mesut Ozil (25 years old, 39 apps/1 goal for Schalke before £4m move to Werder Bremen in 2008)

‘Mesut was unbelievable at a young age, a real No 10. But now I don’t think he is the right player for the Premier League (with Arsenal). He is not a fighter. If you need to fight in a match then that’s not him. I think it would be good for him to make a new start, but he is too expensive for us now!’

AND ONE FOR THE FUTURE…

Max Meyer (18 years old, 50 apps/7 goals, still at club)

‘He has already been capped by Germany. He is unbelievable. I have never seen anyone like him. You can wake him up at four o’clock in the morning and he’ll go out and play. He could be one of the best players in the world in the future. But when he was 14 he was so small, everyone said “what do you want with this player?”. We realised the potential he had. He had skills you cannot learn.’
