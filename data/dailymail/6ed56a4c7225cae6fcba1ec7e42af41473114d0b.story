Attorney General Dominic Grieve said the government had listened to the concerns of media groups

Ministers last night abandoned plans that could have created a ‘black hole’ in history by forcing newspapers to delete details of criminal convictions from their online archives.

In a victory for freedom of expression, Attorney General Dominic Grieve said the government had listened to the concerns of media groups and the Society of Editors that the move could have a ‘chilling effect’.

The controversy stemmed from new rules which are designed to stop jurors from hunting for facts about a case outside the courtroom.

In future, it will become a specific offence for a member of a jury to conduct online research, punishable with a prison term.

But Mr Grieve was also seeking a new power to issue a so-called ‘take-down’ order to UK newspapers.

Once a person was charged with a criminal offence, officials would have been able to identity articles relating to any previous convictions they have – and demand their removal from newspaper websites.

Editors who ignored a request would have faced imprisonment or an unlimited fine for contempt of court.

In theory, the information could be returned to the archive once the trial is complete, but it was feared some papers would not have the resources, permanently wiping facts from the record.

The laws would have applied to UK newspapers, but not the likes of the Huffington Post, which receives millions of hits in Britain. Twitter would not have been covered, either.

In a statement yesterday, Mr Grieve said the proposal was being removed from legislation currently passing through Parliament.

It followed a meeting with the Society of Editors, Newspaper Society and Media Lawyers Association, who have argued the plans would have a “chilling effect” on press freedom.

Announcing the changes, Mr Grieve said in a written ministerial statement: “The proposal was intended to provide the media with a measure of protection and reassurance whilst at the same time enabling the integrity of proceedings to be safeguarded.

‘Although intended as a measure designed to assist and protect the media, the clause has been criticised on the grounds that it gives too much power to the attorney general.

‘These representations were made to me, in particular, by the Society of Editors who in addition do not accept that this clause addresses a pressing problem and have suggested that the current powers available are sufficient to protect proceedings.

‘The Government has considered these concerns very carefully.’ 

Bob Satchwell, executive director of the Society of Editors said: ‘When we met the Attorney we said it would be wrong in principle for a member of the Government to have power to order media organisations to take down material.

‘We also told him that it would cause huge practical problems if defence lawyers sought blanket orders to taken down material which could be seen by jurors.

‘We are very pleased that the Attorney has listened to our concerns.’
