A parking sensor promoted as tool to help drivers find free spaces could also enable traffic wardens to dish out more fines.

Motoring organisations have warned the Metereye system could help wardens make a beeline to vehicles that have overstayed a parking space.

The Metereye technology, developed by Scottish company, Town and City Parking (TCP), works by transmitting signls from a sensor placed on the floor of a parking bay.

The senor records the vehicle arriving, its occupancy and departure date. It then transmits this information in real time to a handheld electronic device.

The system is aimed at parking companies rather than the public, but some local authorities are championing the technology as a tool for drivers to find free spaces quickly.

Metereye is already being used by Westminster council, which has created a dedicated app to help drivers find free parking spaces in the borough.

Park Right, available on smart phones and iPads, picks up the same signals emitted from the Metereye parking sensors.

Edinburgh city council is also using the technology, while other
local authorities, retailers and a major sports stadium have also 
expressed an interest in the system, the manufacturer has said.

The Metereye sensor unit is based around an 'infrared Vehicle Detection System'.

When placed on the floor of a parking bay, the sensor records the vehicle arriving, its occupancy and departure date.

It then transmits this information in real time to a handheld electronic device.

Using the data, a traffic warden can make a note of the time the car arrived at the bay and what time it left - or should have left.

TCP calls Metereye a 'simple, cost effective way to monitor usage of car parking bays,' on its website.

It
also extolls the benefits of the handheld technology where one parking 
attendant 'can be responsible for two or three sites at the same time.'

While local authorities have championed the technology for
drivers, they have been less vocal about its potential for traffic 
wardens. A move that has angered motoring organisations.

Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, told the Daily Telegraph: 'This gives wardens the equivalent of eyes in the backs of their heads.

'The all-knowing equipment will be good for the parking industry and in car parks where space is at a premium.

'But some drivers might ask, where's the sense of fair play? Motorists will hope it won't encourage attendants to lie in wait for people who have only slightly overstayed their welcome.'

Councils in England and Wales made more than half a billion pounds profit from parking in 2010/2011, according to official figures.

Lewis Johnson, a data analyst with Westminster council, told a computer magazine that the Metereye technology could be used to identify streets which have heavy parking use before raising charges accordingly.

He said: 'It is likely to confirm drivers' suspicions that this sort of technology favours Big Brother rather than the motorist, despite what the councils say.'
