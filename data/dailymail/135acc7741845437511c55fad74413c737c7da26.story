A breakthrough in genetic science could pave the way for the developments of drugs for asthma and other allergies.

Scientists have discovered 34 genes that predispose people to allergies, which could become targets for new drugs.

Asthma affects one in ten children in the UK, and allergies are thought to afflict a third of the population.

This new study, led by scientists at Imperial College London over the last decade, used new ways to study the genes in the immune system.

Scientists pinpointed genes which regulate an antibody involved in triggering allergic responses.

Although the antibody, called immunoglobin E, was already well known, the genes that control it had never been identified.

The discovery creates the process of switching off these genes using drugs.

Professor William Cookson, from the National Heart and Lung Institute at Imperial College London, said: ‘Our pioneering approach allowed us to obtain insights that we weren’t able to get from traditional genetics.

‘It isn’t just the genetic code that can influence disease and DNA sequencing can only take you so far.

‘Our study shows that modifications on top of the DNA that control how genes are read may be even more important.”

The research, published in the journal Nature, focused on genes that are altered by an environmentally-triggered process called methylation, which switches them off.

White blood cells from British families affected by asthma were analysed to compare levels of methylation with the amount of the antibody in the blood.

The scientists found strong associations between the antibody and low methylation rates in 34 genes.

Tests confirmed that all 34 genes were most active in asthmatics with high levels of the antibody.

If the genes can be switched on using drugs, the antibody levels could be reduced and allergies effectively treated.

Dr Samantha Walker, director of research at Asthma UK, said: ‘We welcome this research which explores the genetic relationship between allergies and asthma which could bring us one step closer to developing ground-breaking asthma treatments and finding a cure.’
