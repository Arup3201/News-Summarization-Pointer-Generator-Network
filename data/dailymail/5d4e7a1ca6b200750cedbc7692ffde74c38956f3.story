The BBC made an embarrassing blunder this afternoon after announcing that the former Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher had died after suffering a strike instead of a stroke.

An update on the mobile website of BBC News wrongly stated that she had been killed by a form of industrial action.

It read: 'Reaction as former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher dies following a strike.'

Embarrassing: The BBC made a blunder this afternoon after announcing that the former Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher had died after suffering a strike instead of a stroke

In reality she suffered a stroke and passed away at the age of 87.

The gaffe was spotted by the @HeardinLondon Twitter account, which sarcastically tweeted: 'Well done, BBC.'

The post has been retweeted more than 800 times and received nearly 150 favourites.

In response to the mistake a BBC spokesperson said: 'This was an error which was quickly corrected.'

The error provoked amusement on the internet with one Twitter user calling the gaffe 'The most ironic typo ever,' while another questioned 'Most inappropriate typo ever?'

When Baroness Thatcher came to power in May 1979, it was at the end of the infamous Winter of Discontent, where Britain was crippled by a wave of national strikes.

Mistake: An update on the mobile website of BBC News wrongly stated that the former Prime Minister had been killed by a bout of industrial action. Right, a 1984 photo showing police taking action as violence flares with miners at Daw Mill colliery in Warwickshire

The Iron Lady, named because of her 
strong will, spent the next decade curbing the power of trade unions, 
signalling the end of an era when trade union leaders trooped in and out
 of 10 Downing Street, haggling and bargaining with her Labour 
predecessors.

Instead she stripped the unions of 
many of their powers with the aim of transferring them to management 
and individual consumers.

Mrs Thatcher successfully defied 
Arthur Scargill's nationwide and year-long miners' strike, which 
threatened to cripple Britain's entire economy.

And as she transformed the nation - 
attempting to release the grip of the state on massive industries and 
public services alike - she became one of the most influential, 
talked-about, listened-to and dominant statesmen of the Western world.

Other criticism leveled at the corporation was when viewers noticed that news anchors were not wearing black ties.

Presenter Huw Edwards was not wearing a dark tie fronting the Thatcher special on BBC News Channel.

One Twitter user wrote: 'Would it be too much for the BBC news readers to put on a black tie and show some respect!?!'

While another wrote: 'No black tie for BBC News Channel presenter? Surprising.'

It is thought that the corporation's staff are only obliged to wear a black tie when a death occurs which they class as a Category One - such as the Queen.
