A California woman who tried to kill her husband nearly three years ago has been sentenced to prison.

Laura Jean Wenke wrapped herself in bubble wrap, donned a mechanic's jumpsuit and boots and then stabbed her husband Randy in September 2011 after first shooting him with a taser.

Ms Wenke was said to be jealous her estranged husband had a new girlfriend, but she also was the beneficiary his $2 million life insurance policy.

Lauren Wenke, pictured her in an arrest shot from 2011, was sentenced this week to eleven years to life in prison for the attempted murder of then-estranged husband Randy

She was convicted in June of attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon, assault with a stun gun and domestic violence.

Last year she pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. During the trial her defense team argued that Ms Wenke suffered from mental illness and dissociative stress disorder that left her disconnected from her actions, reports the San Jose Mercury News.

The jury didn't buy it.

The couple had filed for divorce in August 2010 and the split was acrimonious. They were living apart but still working together at the time of the attack.

Police in Los Altos, California, said she had carefully planned the attack on her husband as he sat working in his office.

Her then 48-year-old husband was working at his computer at Wenke Construction in Redwood City when his wife attacked.

Ms Wenke shot a stun gun into her estranged husband's side, stabbed him in the neck from left to right and stabbed his chest while he was still sitting at his computer.

He was able to call 911 and police officers found him outside the building, bleeding.

His wife was still in his office, her bubble wrap outfit streaked with blood, when officers arrested her.

The bubble wrap was believed to be protective in case her husband managed to turn the stun gun on his attacker.  

The couple has one son, who was just eight at the time of the attack.

Ms Wenke will be eligible for parole in nine years.
