It may have been a little warmer in Italy than much of the United Kingdom at eight oâ€™clock this morning.

But that should take nothing away from the brave efforts of those who stripped down to their underwear for the beginning of the January sales in the cities of Rome and Turin.

These photographs show the bargain hunters queuing up outside designer shops promising free clothes and discounts.

Shoppers queued up in their underwear before racing into this store in Rome to claim free clothing

Shoppers were promised free clothes in the capital if they could be among the first 100 outside the store

And further north, it was a similar story in Turin, where another 100 shoppers were promised free clothing

The Seminaked Party was organised by Desigual, which promised the first 100 that they would be dressed for free.

Participants began queuing in Turin late last night for the 8am opening, according to local reports.

And those who arrived as late as 3am missed out on the free clothing.

To soften the blow, the store was selling a number of items at half price this morning.

The Seminaked Party was organised by Desigual, a Spanish designer brand, for 8am in Rome city centre

The Spanish brand has previously held the parties in Madrid, Barcelona and other Spanish cities as well as London.

It has also been held in European capitals including Berlin, Paris, Amsterdam and Lisbon.

And the party has travelled across continents to Tokyo, in Japan, and New York in the United States.

The Seminaked Party was launched in 2005 by Desigual.

The company claims that more than 10,000 people have participated in the parties.

The Desigal Seminaked Party will return next week to the streets of Paris.

In addition to dressing in just their underwear again, participants will also be required to take part in a 100-metre race.

Before Rome, it has also been held in European capitals including Berlin, Paris, Amsterdam and Lisbon

The mad rush began in Turin this morning when the store opened its doors at 8am

The Seminaked Party came to London in 
2011. Despite organising the event for a summer month, shoppers were 
still left drenched after queuing from 11pm in the rain and cold for a 
9am opening.

The first 100 through the door got a free top and 
bottoms, but everyone else who turned up in their underwear got treated 
to 50 per cent off Desigual's summer collection.

In the England capital, the half-naked shoppers were serenaded by Australian band Set Sail and treated to goodie bags as they queued.
