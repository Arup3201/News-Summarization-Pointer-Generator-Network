NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has landed robotic explorers on the surface of Mars, sent probes to outer planets and operates a worldwide network of antennas that communicates with interplanetary spacecraft.

The agency's latest mission is defending itself in a workplace lawsuit it landed last year, filed by a former computer specialist who claims he was demoted - and then let go - for promoting his views on intelligent design.

David Coppedge claims he was discriminated against because of his belief that a higher power must have had a hand in creation, because life is too complex to have developed through evolution alone.

Mr Coppedge, who worked as a 'team lead' on the Cassini mission exploring Saturn and its many moons, alleges he was sacked because he engaged his co-workers in conversations about intelligent design and handed out DVDs on the idea while at work.

He lost his 'team lead' title in 2009 and was let go last year after 15 years on the mission.

Opening statements are expected to begin Monday in Los Angeles Superior Court after two years of legal wrangling in a case that has generated interest among supporters of intelligent design.

The Alliance Defense Fund, a Christian civil rights group, and the Discovery Institute, a proponent of intelligent design, are both supporting Mr Coppedge's case.

'It's part of a pattern. There is basically a war on anyone who dissents from Darwin and we've seen that for several years,' said John West, associate director of Center for Science and Culture at the Seattle-based Discovery Institute. 'This is free speech, freedom of conscience 101.'

The National Center for Science Education, which rejects intelligent design as thinly veiled creationism, is also watching the case and has posted all the legal filings on its website.

'It would be unfortunate if the court took what seems to be a fairly straightforward employment law case and allowed it to become this tangled mess of trying to adjudicate scientific matters,' said Josh Rosenau, NCSE's programs and policy director.

'It looks like a pretty straightforward case. The mission that he was working on was winding down and he was laid off.'

Mr Coppedge's attorney, William Becker, says his client was singled out by his bosses because they perceived his belief in intelligent design to be religious.

His client had a reputation around JPL as an evangelical Christian and other interactions with co-workers led some to label him as a Christian conservative, Mr Becker said.

In the lawsuit, Mr Coppedge says he believes other things also led to his demotion, including his support for a state ballot measure that sought to define marriage as limited to heterosexual couples and his request to rename the annual holiday party a 'Christmas party.'

'David had this reputation for being a Christian, for being a practicing one. He did not go around evangelising or proselytising. But if he found out that someone was a Christian he would say, "Oh that's interesting, what denomination are you?"' Becker said.

'He's not apologising for who he is. He's an evangelical Christian.'

In an emailed statement, JPL dismissed Mr Coppedge's claims.

In court papers, lawyers for the California Institute of Technology, which manages JPL for NASA, said Mr Coppedge received a written warning because his co-workers complained of harassment.

They also said Mr Coppedge lost his 'team lead' status because of ongoing conflicts with others.

Caltech lawyers contend Mr Coppedge was one of two Cassini technicians and among 246 JPL employees let go last year due to planned budget cuts.

While
the case has attracted interest because of the controversial nature of 
intelligent design, it is at its heart a straightforward discrimination 
case, said Eugene Volokh, a professor of First Amendment law at the 
University of California, Los Angeles School of Law.

'The
question is whether the plaintiff was fired simply because he was 
wasting people's time and bothering them in ways that would have led him
to being fired regardless of whether it was about religion or whether 
he was treated worse based on the religiosity of his beliefs,' said Mr 
Volokh. 'If he can show that, then he's got a good case.'

Mr Coppedge, who began working for JPL as a contractor in 1996 and was hired in 2003, is active in the intelligent design sphere and runs a website that interprets scientific discoveries through the lens of intelligent design.

His father authored an anti-evolution book and founded a Christian outreach group.

He is also a board member for Illustra Media, a company that produces video documentaries examining the scientific evidence for intelligent design. The company produces the videos that Mr Coppedge was handing out to co-workers, said Becker, his attorney.

His main duties at JPL were to maintain computer networks and troubleshoot technical problems for the mission. In 2000, he was named 'team lead', serving as a liaison between technicians and managers for nearly a decade before being demoted in 2009.

He sued in April 2010 alleging religious discrimination, retaliation and harassment and amended his suit to include wrongful termination after losing his job last year.

Mr Coppedge is seeking attorney's fees and costs, damages for wrongful termination and a statement from the judge that his rights were violated, said Mr Becker.
