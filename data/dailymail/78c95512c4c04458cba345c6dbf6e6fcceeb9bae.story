There was a split second in the tunnel of Brazil’s Estadio da Cidadania on Sunday night that summed up perfectly the 90 minutes that had gone before.

Six days out from their date with England in Manaus, Italy had overcome some defensive blips to destroy Brazilian club side Fluminense 5-3 and the Italian press pack wanted one man — Ciro Immobile.

Little known outside Italy, Immobile has evoked memories of countryman Toto Schillaci, who burst on to the world stage at Italia 90 and ended up with the Golden Boot.

Potential: Italy striker Ciro Immobile could emulate Toto Schillaci's impact

Golden Boot: Schillaci was top scorer at Italia '90

New kid on the block: Mario Balotelli was totally outshone by Immobile as Italy beat Fluminese

Friendly and engaging and still 
buzzing after a hat-trick and two assists in his third appearance for 
Italy, Immobile held court and politely answered every question.

About
 three minutes in, Mario Balotelli came skulking down the same gangway, 
ignoring everyone. As he walked behind the oblivious Immobile, the 
Azzurri’s No 1 striker moved in to flick the rookie’s ear — and missed. 
It was that kind of night, for them both.

While
 Immobile was an all-action nuisance to Fluminense’s backline for his 
stunning 60-minute cameo, Balotelli’s half-hour was highlighted by him 
crumpling under a challenge and seeming to decide not to put too much 
more into the game.

Limited: Cesare Prandelli's Italy squad are short on striking talent but Immobile could offer another option

To be 
fair, the contest was decided by that point, but it was emphatically 
decided by Immobile — and manager Cesare Prandelli must now consider him
 for Saturday’s Group D opener against England.

Immobile
 said: ‘I think I might have given him a dilemma. But it is better for 
him to have a problem like this. If he finds it appropriate that I play,
 I’ll be there to help for sure.’

Prandelli
 added: ‘Clearly we have some healthy competition up front. Everyone has
 a chance. Whoever doesn’t play will have to accept the choices. 
Potentially there could be a lot of stars in this squad.’

Immobile’s
 surname means the same in Italian as it does in English so he has long 
since got used to the jibes. But when your movement is as devastating as
 his, it is easier to laugh off the immobility jokes.

Heading to the top: Immobile scored three and set up two in the win against Brazilian side Fluminese

Make yourself at home: Immobile's stylish showing came in only his third game for the Azzurri

The
 24-year-old was top scorer in Serie A last season with 22 goals for 
Torino, enough to persuade Jurgen Klopp to shell out almost £16million 
for his services last week, bringing him to Borussia Dortmund before 
others see him on the world stage.

Labelled
 a penalty-box striker in his homeland, that seems a touch unfair and 
slightly inaccurate. Things may end in the area — his finishing, 
particularly for the third goal, was beyond clinical on Sunday — but 
they begin much further up the pitch.

Three
 of Italy’s five goals came as a result of Immobile springing the 
offside trap. Twice, when clear through, he unselfishly laid off for 
Arsenal target Lorenzo Insigne to grab a brace.

That
 too is a mark of the 6ft 1in former Juventus, Pescara and Genoa 
striker. Immobile is all about the collective, his tireless displays 
helping Torino to pip Balotelli’s Milan to the final European spot on 
goal difference. The selfless attitude could not be more in contrast to 
Italy’s enfant terrible.

Prandelli
 said of Balotelli last month: ‘Not only does Mario have to realise that
 even in a few  minutes you can make your mark. He must also put aside 
the ‘I’ when  thinking of the group.’

Task in hand: Joe Hart is the man charged with keeping Italy at bay in England's World Cup opener

Hot shots: Midfielders Daniele de Rossi and Andrea Pirlo are the top goalscorers in Italy's squad

Goals
 are a pressing issue for the manager. While Italy scored 19 in 
qualifying, five of them from former Manchester City man Balotelli, they
 have got just one in three internationals in 2014, that coming in the 
pitiful 1-1 draw with Luxembourg last week.

The two most prolific scorers in the squad are midfielders Andrea Pirlo and Daniele De Rossi.

Six
 goals in six games was enough to get them to the final of Euro 2012 but
 a creaky defence finally gave way against Spain. And that is the 
concern for the manager: the typical Italian 1-0 win is not so easy to 
rely on with lesser defenders.

Klopp
 is convinced he has stolen one of the rising attacking threats in 
Europe in Immobile. ‘He has a proper edge,’ he said. ‘He is a powerhouse
 who played a big role in many team goals. He is a real warrior.’

Now
 it is up to Prandelli to decide whether his young striker is ready for 
World Cup battle or keep him to spring off the bench. Either way, 
England have been warned. Italy have a new attacking threat.

On the move: Immobile's future lies with Borussia Dortmund after he was transferred from Torino

After a hat-trick in the final warm-up game, Italy striker Ciro Immobile could be the new Salvatore ‘Toto’ Schillaci, who took the 1990 World Cup in his home country by storm. The Italians have form in bringing in untried strikers...

1990 - SALVATORE SCHILLACI

Had played once for Italy before coming off the bench and scoring in the opening match against Austria. Italy lost to Argentina on penalties in the semi-final but Schillaci scored the winner against England in the third-place play-off to win the Golden Boot with six goals.

1978 - PAOLO ROSSI

Won two caps before the tournament but scored 24 goals in 30 Serie A games the season before. He scored three goals in Argentina as Italy finished fourth and was the Golden Boot winner four years later when they lifted the trophy.

1998 - CHRISTIAN VIERI

Scored 29 goals in 32 games for Atletico Madrid in the build-up to France 98 but only had eight caps. Scored five goals at the tournament — one fewer than the top scorer Davor Suker — as Italy went out to France in the  quarter-finals on penalties, though Vieri scored his.

1970 - ROBERTO BONINSEGNA

Had one cap heading to Mexico but the Inter forward started every game. He scored in the semi-final against West Germany and equalised against Brazil in the final as Italy lost 4-1.
