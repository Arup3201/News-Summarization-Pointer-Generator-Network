Steve Jobs is remembered as one of the greatest minds of his generation - but during his lifetime, he was convinced that his achievements would be swiftly forgotten.

In a newly unearthed interview, the Apple founder complained that because of the fast pace of technological innovation, his inventions became out-of-date within just a few years.

'All the work that I have done in my life will be obsolete by the time I'm 50,' Jobs said in the interview, recorded in 1994 when he was 39.

Pensive: The Apple founder compared himself to a layer of sediment contributing to the growth of a mountain

At the time of the interview, which was posted to YouTube this week, he had already turned Apple into one of the world's leading computer companies with inventions such as the Apple II and the Macintosh.

In the years to come before his death in 2011, he would go on to launch revolutionary devices such as the iPod, iPhone and iPad.

However, in 1994 he pointed out that technological breakthroughs were inherently fleeting, because they were inevitably overtaken by newer innovations.

'This is not a field where one paints a painting that will be looked at for centuries, or builds a church that will be admired for centuries,' he said.

'This is a field where one does one's work and then in 10 years it's obsolete - and really will not be usable within 10 or 20 years.'

He went on to compare technological innovations to the formation of a mountain, with each individual's contribution quickly forgotten even if it has a lasting impact.

'It's sort of like sediment of rocks,' he said.' You're building up a mountain and you get to contribute your little layer of sedimentary rock to make the mountain that much higher.

'But no one on the surface, unless they have X-ray vision, will see your sediment. They'll stand on it. It'll be appreciated by that rare geologist.'

The clip, posted online by EverySteveJobsVideo, is taken from an hour-long documentary called Steve Jobs: Visionary Entrepreneur, based around the newly discovered 1994 interview.

When Jobs died of cancer aged 56, the news was met with a global outpouring of grief as he was hailed as one of the defining figures in the history of technology.

In his second stint as chief executive of the company he founded in a garage alongside Steve Wozniak, he revolutionised music and communications by launching the first popular MP3 player followed by the iPhone, the world's leading smartphone.

He also helped change the way technology companies market themselves by opening the Apple stores to sell the firm's products directly, as well as the iTunes portal for downloading music online.
