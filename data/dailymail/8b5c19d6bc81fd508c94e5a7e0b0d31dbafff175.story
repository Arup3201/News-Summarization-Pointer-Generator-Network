The public relations expert hired to help restore public opinion in the city of Ferguson has been fired as it emerged he shot a man dead eight years ago.

Devin James was brought in to rebuild the community after a white police officer shot unarmed black teenager Michael Brown.

But today his employers were forced to apologize for the appointment as they discovered James was convicted of reckless homicide in Tennessee in 2006.

James has founded his company on his personal story of overcoming a background filled with gangs and drugs - and says the shooting in Shelby County, Tennessee, was in self defense.

Fired: Devin James has been fired a month after he was hired as it emerges he shot a man dead in 2006

It comes the day after violent protests broke out in the city with people calling for the police chief to resign. 

James was subcontracted two weeks after the killing on August 9 as authorities were condemned for failing to employ senior figures of ethic minorities.

The case has sparked a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into the Ferguson Police Department for possible civil rights violations in the majority-black district.

Today, Ferguson Mayor James Knowles told the Post Dispatch that Ferguson officials knew about the conviction before they signed a contract with him. 

However, a spokesman for St. Louis Economic Development Partnership today revealed James failed to declare his conviction when he took up the $155-an-hour job, the St Louis Post Dispatch reported.

Conflict: Last night protesters called on police chief Thomas Jackson to resign as he stepped out to apologize

Anger: Signs that read 'Chief Jackass resign' were bound to the gates of the station as violence broke out

James - whose firm The Devin James Company has offices in California, Illinois, Missouri, Oregon and Washington state - was behind the apology video recorded by Police Chief Thomas Jackson to Michael Brown's family and supporters on Thursday.

The video to Brown's family and the community acknowledged that Brown's body - which was left for more than four hours - should have been removed from the street much sooner after he was killed.

Acknowledging the decision to terminate his contract, James told CNN: 'I started my company shortly afterwards and pretty much have been doing everything I could to get my life on the right track and to get going in a different direction.

'I've always been forthright with my clients about that.'

Devastation: The shooting of unarmed black teenager has uncovered deep divisions between races in the majority-black community. Supporters continue to lay tributes more than a month after the killing

Protesters perform a 'hands up, don't shoot' chant. Michael Brown allegedly held his hands up as he was shot

A statement from St. Louis Economic Development Partnership read: 'We have asked Elasticity, our contracted communications firm, to release Devin James from his subcontractor role, due to a lack of transparency. 

'While we admire his personal growth from difficult circumstances and commend him for his high quality work in Ferguson, it was the lack of information about his background that prompted us to make this move. 

'Mr. James failed to inform us of his prior conviction. 

'He also did not reveal this information to Elasticity when he was hired as a subcontractor. 

'As of today, we are developing new vendor due diligence policies which we believe will prevent similar incidents in the future.'
