A prankster dad may win the award for cruelest joke after he tricked his wife into thinking he threw his toddler son off of the balcony.

Roman Atwood set up cameras and enlisted the help of his two sons in an elaborate attempt to frighten his unassuming wife and fool her into thinking he'd accidentally killed their toddler son.

The stunt, which was posted on YouTube on November 30 and already has almost 5 million views, begins with Atwood playing with his son, who is dressed in a Spider-Man costume covering his face, on the top floor of their Los Angeles, California home. 

Like any other day: A loving mother returns to her home in Los Angeles where she finds her husband Roman Atwood playing with their toddler son who is dressed in a Spider-Man costume

The switcheroo: Roman Atwood enlists the help of his elder son who leads the toddler into the other room then hands his dad the small dummy dressed in the same costume as his son 

The launch: Roman Atwood pretends to throw his son over the balcony as  his wife lets out a shriek and rushes towards what she believes is her fallen son

Atwood and his son are greeted lovingly by the boy’s mother, who is then sent downstairs 'to grab them some water' so that they can prepare the prank behind her back.

Atwood enlists the help of his older son who leads his younger brother into the other room them substitutes the toddler for a dummy, which Atwood then tosses over the railing.

His wife runs downstairs and screams in paralyzing fear as she sees the boy falling to the ground below and laying motionless on the ground as though he had died. 

She unveils the boy's mask to reveal a dummy under the costume and then proceeds to shoot a disgusted glance at her husband.

'Why would you do that?!' she screams still trembling in shock.

'It's just for fun,' Atwood responds as he shrugs his shoulders

She then sentences her husband to a lonely night of sleeping on the couch and gives him a little kick in the groin before she storms out of the room.

Petrified: The concerned mother rushes towards the dummy she believes to be her badly injured son

Unmasked: the mother removes the mask to see the damage done and sees  what she thought was her son is nothing more than a dummy

Horrified: Atwood's wife tells him that he'll be sleeping on the couch and gives him a kick to the groin before leaving the room in a huff
