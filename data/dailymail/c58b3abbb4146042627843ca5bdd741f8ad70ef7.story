Despite the fact digital cameras are falling by the wayside in favour of smartphones, the technology is taking a little while to catch up.

The main reason being that smartphones are much thinner than cameras, and therefore can’t pack in the same quality and size of sensors – until now.

Engineers from Israel have designed a dual-lens system that is thin enough to fit in an 9mm smartphone and is capable of achieving an optical zoom five times greater than 3x digital zoom.

Corephotonics’ zoom uses is a dual aperture camera and an image fusion library.

The sensor takes two photos from different angles and this library fuses these images together into a single high-quality picture.

With the depth of field feature, the sensors take photos and plot various depth points around objects that in shot.

It will select what it considers the main focal point, but because it has stored points of the other items, these can be selected and brought into focus at the tap of the screen.

This feature is seen on the HTC One M8, for example.

This means phone cameras will be able to take crystal-clear images taken from feet away and it could spell the end of blurred and cloudy images often associated smartphones and tablets.

The technology was originally showcased by makers Corephotonics during this year’s Mobile World Congress in February.

Corephotonics is run by Professor David Mendlovic, an electrical engineer at Tel Aviv University and his former colleague Dr Gal Shabtay.

As well as high-quality zooming functions, the dual sensor can also create depth of field effects.

By capturing the depths of everything in a photo automatically, this means the focus can be changed during editing – a feature seen on the dual-sensor of the HTC One M8.

However, neither company has confirmed that the sensor used in HTC's latest flagship model is the one developed by Corephotonics.

Corephotonics' sensor takes two photos from different angles and fuses these images together into a high-quality picture. The left-hand image shows a photo taken with digital zoom on a traditional phone camera. The right-hand image is one taken using Corephotonics' sensor

At least one, unnamed, mobile phone manufacturer has already signed up to take the new system from Corephotonics, and others are expected to follow.

Professor Mendlovic said: ‘Our technology provides up to three times the zoom factor, has improved low-light performance, and can fit into compact dimensions.’

The first handsets with the new technology are expected to be available at the beginning of next year.

‘If successful, we’ll define a new standard for the next-generation compact camera...resulting in an entirely new user experience,’ continued Professor Mendlovic.
