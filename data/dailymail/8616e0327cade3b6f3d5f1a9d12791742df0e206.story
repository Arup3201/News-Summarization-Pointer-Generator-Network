Love triangle: Timothy John 'TJ' Brewer pleaded guilty to two counts of assault and received a two-year suspended sentence

A betrayed husband has been charged after beating his father and hitting his wife in an alcohol-fueled rage after allegedly catching them having sex in his son's bedroom last month.

Caught in a bizarre family love triangle, Timothy John 'TJ' Brewer, 33, allegedly found his wife Logan Rae Brewer 'on top of his dad', respected Moab fire chief Wesley 'Corky' Brewer, after they had dinner at TJ's Utah home on July 11.

Furious at their love tryst, TJ 'backhanded' his wife and pointed a gun at her, before 'pistol whipping' his father, who later stabbed himself.

According to police documents published by TPM, the
 trouble started when Logan went upstairs after dinner - during which they 
had all been drinking - to put one of her children to bed.

Realizing he was alone in the house, TJ, a 12-year veteran of the Moab sheriff's office, went upstairs to find his wife.

Deseret News reports Brewer told investigators he found his son's bedroom door locked, got into the room, and 'lost it' when he found his father and wife in bed together.

Logan told officers her husband beat his father, then left the bedroom and returned with a handgun he had just loaded.

'She stated TJ hit her, backhanded her, and pointed a handgun at her face,' an officer wrote. 'She believed he was going to shoot her.'

Happier times: TJ Brewer allegedly found his wife Logan Brewer having sex with his father in their son's bed

Logan raced to her parents’ 
house after the altercation, while Corky returned to his own home to 'find a firearm.'

However when his 
distressed wife, Cindy Brewer, tried to hide the gun in the car, Corky 
allegedly 'grabbed a butcher knife and stabbed himself two 
times, puncturing a lung and slicing his liver'.

Cindy pulled the kitchen knife out before Corky
 was rushed to Moab Regional Hospital. He was too injured to talk to police and eventually had to be flown to a Colorado hospital for surgery. 

TJ
 and Corky were among several law enforcement officers in the extended Brewer 
family, which includes multiple police officers and local sheriff’s 
deputies.

TPM reports the sheriff's deputy went to the hospital to 'kill' his father, and was initially confronted by his uncle, Curt Brewer, who is also a sheriff’s
 deputy, in the parking lot. 

When police arrived, intoxicated TJ was not wearing a shirt or shoes and 'stated several
 times that he wanted to kill his dad, that he wanted his gun to ‘finish
 the job'.'

Police wrote in their report: 'TJ
 made numerous remarks to each officer and deputy that arrived, about 
all of us being stupid, dumb asses, and at one point stated we needed to
 call someone with a brain to come and talk with him.'

Deseret News also reported that TJ, who worked in the narcotics unit of the sheriff's office, allegedly hit an officer.

According to the Salt Lake Tribune, officers accompanied TJ home so he could check on his children, breaking down on the way saying he had lost everything.

TJ was arrested and charged with attempted homicide, aggravated assault, two 
counts of domestic violence in front a child, assault on a police 
officer, intoxication, and disorderly conduct by Grand County officers.

However, because of the Brewers' law enforcement ties in Grand County, the investigation was passed onto the Utah County Sheriff’s Office who reduced the charges to two class A misdemeanors - assault and assault against a 
peace officer.

The Utah Attorney General is also prosecuting the case rather than the local 
district attorney.

TPM reports TJ was released from the San Juan County Jail on bail on July 15.

He
 is forbidden from drinking alcohol, contacting his father and wife, and he must be supervised when he visits his children.

TJ resigned 
from the Grand County Sheriff’s Department and is next due in court on Tuesday. If convicted, he faces up to two years in prison.

Corky also resigned from the fire department where he had been
 chief since 1989.

Deseret News reports TJ'S wife will refuse to testify against her husband if called to do so, filing notice she intends to assert spousal privilege .
