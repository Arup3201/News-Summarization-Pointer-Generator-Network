A man is lucky to be alive after he miraculously survived for 14 hours trapped in a tiny air bubble after his car flipped upside down and into a ditch of water.

Mark Beckford was reported missing by his wife Lesley, 60, on Tuesday morning when he failed to come home.

The 45-year-old was driving at about 2am when his red MG ZR came off the road and into the ditch near Hamstreet in Kent.

But the taxi driver was not discovered until shortly before 4pm.

He was found trapped with just an air pocket at the back of the car to keep him from drowning.

Kent Fire and Rescue Service crews were called after a lorry driver spotted the back wheels of a car upside down.

Wife Lesley, 60, of New Romney, said: 'We were in a panic. We were ringing everyone. Nobody knew where he was.

'I rang him up to five times from work and all I got was the voicemail service. When I got home he was still not there and then I reported him missing.'

Mrs Beckford’s daughters Melanie Wellman and Nichola O’Shea, were among the family members who spent the night calling friends, the hospital and police to find Mr Beckford.

Miss Wellman said: 'Mark was never able to call for help because his phone was lost in the ditch during the accident. It was never even found when they rescued him.'

Romney Marsh Watch Manager, Alan Brown, said: 'The car was almost submerged in 4ft of water and the firefighters used hydraulic cutting equipment to release the hatchback door so they could check if there was anyone inside.

'In order to release him, crews winched the car partially up the bank so it was far enough out of the water to safely remove him through the hatch back door.'

The Hazardous Area Response Team (HART) attended the scene and two HART paramedics also entered the water to assist in dry suits. 

The driver was treated at the scene by paramedics and a doctor before being taken by ambulance to the William Harvey Hospital where he is currently in a stable condition.

Rob Sherwood of Kent Fire and Rescue Service praised emergency crews for their hard work.

He said: 'This was a very unusual rescue and they all did a good job in difficult circumstances.

'I would like to praise the lorry driver for spotting the car and calling 999. If he hadn’t stopped for a look then the man would have been in there even longer and it might have been a different outcome.

'Our firefighters managed to get into the car and provided an initial medical response until the ambulance teams quickly took over. All the emergency services at the scene worked as a team to achieve this rescue.'

The A2070 between Hamstreet and Brenzett was closed in both directions while police recovered the vehicle.

Kent Police are appealing for witnesses to the crash.
