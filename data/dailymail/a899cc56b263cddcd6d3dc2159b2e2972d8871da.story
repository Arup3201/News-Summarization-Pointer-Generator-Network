A mother chipped her tooth a slice of Domino's pizza which contained a metal nut.

Bella Peppiatt was tucking into a vegetarian pizza from the fast food chain when she bit into the hard screw.

The 28-year-old carer immediately contacted the branch in Tilehurst, Berkshire, where she had ordered the pizza from.

Staff offered to send a replacement - but Ms Peppiatt, from Whitley in Berkshire, then contacted the company's headquarters demanding to know what they would do about her chipped tooth.

Domino's has apologised for the incident and said it was the result of a screw coming loose from a pizza cutter.

The company has offered to pay for her dental work - as well as a full refund for the pizza. 

A Domino's spokesman said: 'After our investigation, unfortunately, the metal screw was found to have come loose from one of our pizza cutters.

'Although this is a very rare and isolated incident, we have already been in touch with our supplier and store to ensure this does not happen again.

Ms Peppiatt was offered a replacement from staff at the branch in School Road, pictured, in Tilehurst, where she had ordered the pizza from

'We would like to send our heartfelt and sincere apologies to our customer for this experience. We have offered to reimburse them for any dental work that may result, provided a full refund and vouchers.

'Our goal is to provide the best experience every time. If we fail to do that, we will do all we can to make it right.' 

Last year, a similar incident occurred when a seven-year-old girl narrowly avoided choking after taking bite of a KFC chicken burger containing a metal nut.

Leah Neat had asked for some of her father's burger during a family outing at the KFC in Gravesend, Kent.

But when she passed it back to Daniel Neat, 35, he was shocked to find a piece of metal in the middle of the burger. 

Leah's mother Sharon said she won't step back into the store in Kent, despite being told a full investigation would be launched.

A KFC spokesman said at the time that the family were offered an apology and a full refund.
