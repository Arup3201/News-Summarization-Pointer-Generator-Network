A Roman Catholic schoolteacher who claims she was fired by a nothern Indiana diocese for trying to get pregnant through in vitro fertlization, will have her day in court. 

U.S. District Judge Robert L Miller Jr ruled this week that former St Vincent de Paul school teacher Emily Herx deserves a chance to prove that she was terminated by the Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend based on sex discrimination.  

This issue 'is whether Mrs. Herx was nonrenewed because of her sex, or because of a sincere belief (by the diocese) about the morality of in vitro fertilization,' Miller wrote in the 29-page ruling issued Wednesday

Emily Herx (left) claims she was fired as a teacher from a Catholic school in 2011, for undergoing in vitro fertility treatments to get pregnant with her husband Brian (right). A district court judge ruled this week that the case can go to trial 

Herx, of Hoagland, Indiana, sued the diocese in April 2012, alleging that her firing by the diocese violated the Civil Rights Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act by discriminating against her based on gender and on infertility, which is considered a disability.

The 34-year-old taught literature and language arts at the school from 2003 - 2011.

Bishop Kevin Rhodes allegedly told Herx that the fertility treatment was 'an intrinsic evil' 

Herx spoke about her firing when she first filed the lawsuit. Appearing on the Today Show, Herx and her husband recalled how  they were first encouraged to try in vitro when after their first child was born, doctors told Herx she wouldn't be able to get pregnant naturally again.

She says she was straightforward with her employers, telling the school's principal that she was going to try in vitro and would need time off for the treatments. 

He allegedly granted the time off and said: 'You are in my prayers'. 

But when she asked for more time off in May 2011, for a second round of in vitro, Herx was told to report to Msgr John Kuzmich, the pastor of the St Vincent de Paul Catholic Church.

According to court documents, Msgr Kuzmich called Herx a 'grave, immoral sinner' and that if news of the IVF treatments got out, it would cause a 'scandal' for the church. 

The Catholic Church has long disapproved of these fertility treatments because additional embryos are created to increase the chances of pregnancy, and are sometimes destroyed  when one egg takes.

Herx then appealed to Bishop Kevin Rhodes, assuring him that no embryos were destroyed in her individual treatment. 

But that meeting was just as negative, with Bishop Rhodes saying: 'The process of in vitro fertilization very frequently involves the deliberate destruction or freezing of human embryos.

'In vitro fertilization...is an intrinsic evil, which means that no circumstances can justify it.' 

In his decision this week, Miller denied Herx's claim that she was fired for her infertility, rather than the treatment itself, which is banned under Catholic doctrine.

'The Diocese appears to be exactly right: all the evidence in the record indicates that the Diocese acted because of Mrs. Herx's choice of fertility treatment and not on any animus against infertility,' he wrote.

Part of Herx's complaint on the sex discrimination issue was that men play a different role in the procedure and if it is successful, they don't become pregnant, said Christopher Stake, one of the attorneys who represented Herx.

The diocese has argued that the policy against in vitro fertilization treats men and women the same. But Miller said a jury might not accept that argument.

'The Diocese hasn't terminated any men for participation in this (or any other) infertility treatment,' he noted.

Also in the ruling, Miller spurned the diocese's argument that, as a religious organization, it is protected from Herx's claims.

Religious employers are not immune to federal laws against sex discrimination, he wrote.

Miller also disagreed with the diocese's claim that Herx was a lay 'minister' in the church, and therefore her termination was protected by the federal ministerial exception, which gives religious organizations leeway in the treatment of their ministers.

'Nothing in the summary judgment record suggests that Mrs. Herx was a member of the clergy of the Catholic Church,' he wrote, adding that she was considered by the principal to be a 'lay teacher.'

Stake said if Herx prevails at trial on the sex discrimination claim, she can still receive the damages she seeks, such as back pay, even though the judge dismissed her disability claim.

The Associated Press left a phone message Friday seeking comment from the diocese's attorney.

In vitro fertilization, or IVF, involves mixing egg and sperm in a laboratory dish and transferring a resulting embryo into the womb.
