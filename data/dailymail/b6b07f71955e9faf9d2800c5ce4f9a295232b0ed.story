A couple were found dead yesterday after taking chemicals in a  suspected suicide pact at a top Scottish hotel.

The discovery of the bodies triggered a major chemical alert in Edinburgh city centre.

Police and firefighters were called to the five-star Scotsman Hotel at lunchtime yesterday.

Investigators entered wearing  special protective suits after a partial evacuation of the historic building was ordered.

It is believed the man and woman, who 
were found in bed together  in their sixth-floor room, were of  Russian 
or Eastern European origin. Their names had not been released last 
night.

Efforts were on-going last night to trace the pair’s next of kin.

It is not known if they were in a relationship but they are believed to have different surnames.

Police were called around 12.15pm after the bodies were found by a cleaner. Guests on three floors were then evacuated.

A large cordon was put in place outside the hotel entrance in North Bridge and along the pavement towards the Balmoral Hotel in Princes Street.

It is understood that a container of chemicals was found in the room.

The fire service treated the deaths as a ‘chemical incident’, which saw around 25 firefighters, three fire engines and a support crew called to the scene.

A ‘detection, identification and monitoring unit’ was also called in to check for hazardous materials.

Firefighters wore protective clothing including ‘gas-tight’ suits and breathing apparatus.

After the initial call, fire crew 
were seen leaving the hotel wearing chemical protection or ‘hazmat’ 
[hazardous materials] gear.

They were then hosed down before removing the protective clothing.

Thousands of performers and tourists 
are currently in Scotland’s capital for the Fringe Festival, which 
officially begins today.

Among those evacuated from the building were guests attending a wedding reception.

Speaking at the scene, Chief 
Inspector Murray Dykes of Police Scotland said: ‘At about 12.15pm, the 
body of a man and woman were discovered within the Scotsman Hotel.

‘There has been a full turnout of police, fire and ambulance.

‘At the moment we are treating the 
deaths as unexplained. We will be doing a full forensic recovery of the 
bodies and inquiries will continue.’

The investigation is at an early stage and neither the ages or nationalities of the deceased had been established.

Asked about the chemical aspect of 
the incident, Mr Dykes said: ‘There has been a hefty response for this. 
We’re treating all things as they come in.

‘The reason that there has been a full turnout is because we are taking full precautions at the moment.’

Sources close to the investigation confirmed that the couple had apparently ingested chemicals.

The Scotsman Hotel is just off the Royal Mile and a short distance from Princes Street, the city’s main shopping thoroughfare.

Standard rooms cost upwards of £250 a night, while the rate for the penthouse suite in late August is £1,125.

Norma and Derek Cameron, from Kelso, 
Roxburghshire, are staying at the hotel for two nights. They were  
prevented from returning to their room on the eighth floor after 
spending a day in the city.

Mrs Cameron, 71, said she and her 
husband had intended to get ready for an evening at the Royal Edinburgh 
Military Tattoo. ‘We wanted to get in and get refreshed,’ she added.

‘The police weren’t giving anything away. They just said that the hotel had been closed and everyone evacuated.

‘It’s horrible to think about. I’m not sure I want to go back in now.’

Lynn Massie, 34, and Neil Cooper, 31,
from Aberdeen, were awaiting to collect their luggage after a two-day 
break when the incident happened.

Miss Massie said: ‘We’re really 
shocked. I feel very sorry for the families of the two people. I don’t 
know what happened but it’s quite sad.

‘You don’t expect something like this to happen at a five-star hotel. It’s a shame for the hotel staff too.’

Guests who left the hotel were not 
permitted to return until the evening. Carl and Susan Ware, from Sydney,
Australia, who had travelled to Edinburgh for the Tattoo, were 
prevented from checking into the hotel.

Mr Ware, 55, said: ‘We were told we 
weren’t allowed in. The incident had already happened when we arrived. 
We were told we could get in at 4.30pm or 4.45pm. I just hope we are not
on the same floor.’

US tourist Betty Cuniberti, from San 
Francisco, California, said she was in her bedroom on the sixth floor 
when the fire alarm sounded and firefighters went round the hotel asking
people to leave.

She said: ‘There was a very loud bang
on the door and when I opened it, it was a fireman and somebody from 
the hotel saying it was being evacuated.

‘They told me it was safe to take the elevator but I wasn’t happy to do that so I took the stairs.
‘I feel just terribly about what’s happened. It’s really tragic.’

Fire crews started to leave the scene at around 4pm yesterday.

However, three floors of the luxury 
hotel remained closed to the public last night, with guests being found 
alternative accommodation.

The Scotsman Hotel in the heart of Scotland’s capital city opened around 12 years ago.

It was once home to the offices of 
The Scotsman newspaper. The building opened its doors to the public in 
Edinburgh for advertising in 1831. The middle floors of the building, 
now home to luxurious rooms and suites, were originally used for 
editorial offices.

The North Bridge Brasserie was once 
the grand reception area. In 2001, the newspaper moved to its own 
purpose-built offices in Holyrood, paving the way for development of the
hotel.

Now with 56 rooms and 12 suites, the 
hotel retains its ‘originality and quirky features and this, along with 
the five-star service we endeavour to deliver, offers visitors a unique 
experience,’ according to the hotel’s website. As part of a major 
£19.5million refurbishment project, the split-level penthouse suite was 
created with a private sauna and a terrace with views across the city.

In another similar incident in May, a
mother and daughter were found dead after a double suicide pact in a 
budget hotel in Greenock, Renfrewshire.

Margaret McDonough, 52, and her 23-year-old daughter Nicola died from slashing wounds.

Their death certificates in June suggested that the women may have cut their own wrists.

Foster carer Mrs McDonough died from ‘incised wounds’ to her left arm.

Her daughter also died from a wound to her left arm.

Mrs McDonough was found dying in a hotel room in the Premier Inn at Greenock on Friday, May 10. 
Her student social worker  daughter lay bleeding heavily in the corridor outside.

The older woman passed away in the 
hours following the discovery, while her daughter succumbed to her 
injuries three days later in hospital.
