Premier League runners-up Liverpool have landed in Boston ahead of opening their US pre-season tour against AS Roma on Wednesday.

Skipper Steven Gerrard led his team mates off the plane behind Brendan Rodgers, showing the way through the terminal to new teammates Lazar Markovic, Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana and Emre Can who were all onboard the flight from Liverpool John Lennon.

Fabio Borini has also been included in the squad, despite Liverpool accepting a bid of around £14million from Sunderland for the Italian striker on Saturday.

Skipper: Steven Gerrard gets off the plane as the Red half of Merseyside descend on Boston

The Reds 
will face AS Roma at Boston’s Fenway Park on Wednesday before taking on 
Olympiacos in Chicago (July 27), Manchester City in New York (July 30) 
and AC Milan in Charlotte (August 2).

Borini
 had been expected to complete his £14million move to Sunderland this 
week. The 23-year-old spent last season on loan at the Stadium of Light 
and manager Gus Poyet is keen to re-sign the Italian.

Markovic,
 meanwhile, sealed his £20m move to Anfield from Benfica last week and 
Liverpool fans will be hoping to get their first glimpse of the Serbian 
in America.
