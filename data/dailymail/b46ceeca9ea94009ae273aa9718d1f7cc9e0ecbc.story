Mexican drug cartels are finding it easier to smuggle drugs into the U.S. thanks to border patrol officials being forced to deal with an unprecedented crisis of illegal migrants.

Texas Attorney General Greg Abbot recently requested an additional $30 million (£17.6m) in funding from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to help deploy more resources to the area.

It comes on the heels of a massive 92 per cent spike from the same period last year in minors being apprehended at the border, thought to be mostly from Central American countries such as Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.

In his request for funding, Abbot described an 'extraordinary influx' of unaccompanied minors to Texas via the state's border from Mexico.

'With the Border Patrol’s focus shifted to this crisis, we have grave concerns that dangerous cartel activity, including narcotics smuggling and human trafficking, will go unchecked because Border Patrol resources are stretched too thin.

'Unless the Department of Homeland Security or another federal agency provides funding, the cartels - which are central to this crisis - will prevail because they profit from each illegal border crossing.'

Chris Cabrera, a Border Patrol union representative told The Washington Post that smugglers were exploiting gaps created in the border when agents were pulled from their stations to deal with groups of people crossing the Rio Grande river.

He told the paper groups as large as 250 wade across and distract officers while the drug traffickers creep across hoping to pass by undetected.

'After that they send over the dope,' he said.

In the Rio Grande Valley sector alone, the Border Patrol made more than 160,000 apprehensions of illegal migrants between October 2013 and May 2014 - an increase of 70 percent over the same period the year before.

Authorities arrested 47,017 unaccompanied minors illegally crossing the border between October and May, up 92 percent from the same period a year earlier, with more than two-thirds of these arrests in the Rio Grande Valley.

Startling photos taken last week document a handful of failed border crossing attempts - the images show young children and even babies sleeping in holding cells at a U.S. Customs and Border Protection processing facility in Brownsville, Texas, where they are held before being deported.
