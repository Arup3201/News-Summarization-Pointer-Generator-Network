Killer: Robin Ligus has been detained indefinitely at a mental hospital

A convicted murderer who killed a pensioner in 1994 will be detained indefinitely in a secure mental hospital after a cold case probe found him responsible for killing two others in the same year.

Robin Ligus, who was jailed for life for killing Robert Young in 1994, was told he will only return to prison to resume his original sentence if he is ever deemed 'fit and safe' to be freed from the specialist unit.

The 59-year-old former painter and decorator, from Shrewsbury, was found responsible for the unlawful killings of both Trevor Bradley and Brian Coles by a jury at Birmingham Crown Court in July.

The month-long trial heard that Ligus, who was desperate for money to buy drugs, killed Mr Bradley near Melverley in April 1994 by knocking him out and setting his car alight.

Jurors also ruled Ligus committed the unlawful killing of Mr Coles, who was bludgeoned to death with an iron bar at his home near Whitchurch, Shropshire, in October 1994.

But he was acquitted of involvement in the death of Bernard Czyzewska, whose body was found in the River Severn in Shrewsbury a month after Mr Colesâ€™ murder.

The serial killer, who watched today's proceedings via a videolink to HMP Woodhill in Buckinghamshire, was originally jailed for life in 1996 after admitting the November 1994 murder of Shrewsbury pensioner Robert Young.

Ordering Ligus to be detained under the 
Criminal Procedure Insanity Act for the unlawful killing of Mr Coles and
Mr Bradley, Mr Justice Treacy noted that both offences took place many 
years ago.

The judge told the court: 'They took 
place in circumstances of considerable violence in the context of crimes
committed for gain... in the same timeframe as the brutal murder of 
Robert Young.

'That sequence of events reveals a highly dangerous individual.'

Ligus will be moved to a secure psychiatric hospital in Northampton within the next 28 days.

West Mercia Police charged the father-of-three with the murders of Mr Bradley, Mr Coles and Mr Czyzewska in September last year after a cold case review into their deaths.

Unusually, the defendant, who uses a wheelchair, was present in the dock for only one day of his trial, having been judged mentally unfit to take part in the proceedings.

Because of Ligus's mental state, jurors were instructed to rule on whether he did the acts alleged against him, rather than being required to return verdicts of guilty or not guilty.
