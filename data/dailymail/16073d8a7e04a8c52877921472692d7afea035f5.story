Rodney Koon (pictured), 46, of Asheville, N.C. was the driver who crashed and killed newlyweds Will and Jamie Reid

The hired limousine driver who crashed and killed a pregnant newlywed couple in North Carolina in August was 'under the influence' when his car ran off the highway.

Rodney Koon, 46, of Asheville, N.C. was charged with driving while impaired and two counts of felony death by motor vehicle this week, for the deaths of Philadelphia schoolteachers Will, 26, and Jamie Reid, 25.

The young teachers were married for just three months before they died and Jamie Soukup Reid, was pregnant with the couple's first child.

Koon was taking the couple to the airport after a wedding and lost control of the vehicle, sending them crashing into a tree.

Ultrasounds were recovered from Jamie's purse after the crash.

Assistant District Attorney Chris Hess declined to discuss the allegations and would not specify whether Koon had been under the influence of alcohol, drugs or another substance.

The driver was released on a $55,000 unsecured bond and a court date has been set for Dec 27, Philly.com reported.

Will Reid's mother Anne Reid told the newspaper: 'We're glad that he is facing some pretty significant charges and that he's likely to serve jail time.

'I'm sorry he made some very, very bad choices, but he does need to pay for those choices, and I think jail is the only way. We were victims of his bad decisions.'

Jamie died instantly when the driver of their hired town car lost control of the vehicle in Asheville, North Carolina on August 11.

Her husband was still conscious when paramedics arrived and he urged them to help his pregnant wife first. He also died from his injuries.

Speaking in August to the Philadelphia Inquirer, Jamie's father Ron Soukup, a retired engineer for Microsoft Corp., shared his heartbreak at losing the young couple, who were both teachers in Philadelphia.

'We lost our two kids and 
our first grandchild,' he said. 'She had the ultrasound 
pictures in her purse.'

He added: 'We loved Will like he was our son. He was a wonderful guy.'

The couple married on May 26 at the 
College of Physicians surrounded by friends and family, and beautiful 
Facebook photographs show them beaming happily on their big day.

They visited Asheville at the weekend to attend a wedding of one of Mr Reid's college friends.

They were in the back of a town car heading east on Interstate 26 that morning when Koon lost control at 11.11am. The vehicle hurtled down an 
embankment and struck a tree, police said.

Jamie was pronounced dead at the scene while her husband died of his injuries at Mission Hospital.

Rodney
 Koon was also hospitalized after the crash but survived.

Police investigators said Koon's 
'actions directly contributed to the collision,' the Asheville 
Citizen-Times reported.

The
 warrants allowed officers to search the vehicle and a digital recording
 device in the car’s electrical system was seized.

Koon operates A Premier Transportation Service Inc. and regularly takes people to and from the airport, the Citizen Times added.

The couple had met while attending the urban education master's program at the University of Pennsylvania and moving in the same social circles, according to a website set up for their wedding.

Mr Reid, who grew up in Phillipsbury, New Jersey, was a math teacher at the People for People charter school.

He
 had been named the Valedictorian for Phillipsburg High School Class of 
2005 before earning a BA degree from Dartmouth College and his Masters 
of Education Degree from UPenn.

His
 wife, who grew up in Sammamish, Washington, taught literature to 
seventh graders at the Harrity Elementary charter school in West 
Philadelphia. She graduated Magna Cum Laude from Whitman College.

'She was fantastic with the written word,' her father said.

Will Reid’s father, James Reid, an orthopedic surgeon in Phillipsburg, said that the young couple were a perfect match for each other.

'He was very talkative and had a dry wit,' Reid said. 'He was very funny. She was just beautiful and nice and happy. She was very caring. They were very much caring for each other.'
