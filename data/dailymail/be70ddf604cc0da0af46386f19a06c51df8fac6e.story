Horrific footage has emerged of a cannibal eating the leg of a Muslim slaughtered by a rampaging Christian mob in the Central African Republic.

The victim was hauled from a bus, battered and then stabbed before being set on fire in the capital city Bangui, according to the BBC.

In the aftermath of the incident, one of his attackers Ouandja Magloire - who also calls himself ‘Mad Dog’ -  grabbed hold of his leg and then began to devour it.

Horrific: Ouandja Magloire - who also calls himself 'Mad Dog' -  is seen eating the leg of a Muslim slaughtered by a rampaging Christian mob in the Central African Republic

Magloire said that his action was revenge for the murders of his pregnant wife, his sister-in-law and her baby

Magloire told a BBC reporter that his action was 
revenge for the murders of his pregnant wife, his sister-in-law and her 
baby.

He claimed that Muslims were responsible and he was angry with them.   

'They broke down the door and cut my baby in half. I promised I would get my revenge,' he said.

Killed: The body is dragged through the dusty streets by the cheering crowd

‘Mad Dog’ spotted his victim on a minibus and followed him after deciding he looked Muslim.

He gathered a crowd of about 20 Christian youths who forced the bus driver to stop and dragged him from the bus.

Without emotion he told the BBC: 'I poured petrol over him. I burned him. I ate his leg, right down the white bone.' 

Witnesses did not intervene but recorded the footage on mobile phones, including the act of cannibalism.

A video shows his cheeks bulging as he consumes the flesh.

Witness
 Jean-Sylvestre Tchya told news agency AFP: 'One of the individuals took
 hold of an arm and went and bought some bread and starting chewing on 
the flesh, along with his bread.

'The scene made many people vomit, and some cried out in horror.'

Another witness, Alain Gbabobou, said he watched a man wrap the head up and proclaim that he would 'feast on it'.

According
 to The Sunday Telegraph, this may not have been an isolated incident, 
with a source speaking of more than one person being eaten.

An aid worker told the paper: 'They were taking machetes to people and burning the bodies and eating 
them.'

Sectarian violence in the Central African Republic (CAR) has been rife in the past month and flared up again following the resignation on Friday of president Michel Djotodia, the first Muslim to rule the Christian-majority nation.

So far it has claimed around 1,000 lives, with the reports of cannibalism bringing to mind the macabre tales associated with Jean Bedel Bokassa, who ruled the CAR with an iron fist between 1966 and 1979.

He was regarded by many as a brutal dictator and was accused of eating human flesh, incorporating it in meals for visiting officials and feeding slain opponents to animals.

He died in 1996 and received a posthumous pardon in 2010.

Some Christian fighters believe that human flesh makes them invincible and put chunks inside amulets that they wear.
