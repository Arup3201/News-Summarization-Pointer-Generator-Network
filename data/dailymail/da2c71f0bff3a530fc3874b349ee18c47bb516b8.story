Cristiano Ronaldo is set to make his 700th career appearance when Real Madrid take on Granada on Saturday.

The 29-year-old has scored 447 goals in 699 professional matches, giving him an average of 0.63 goals per game.

Spanish newspaper AS highlights his improved record since moving to Spain. The 2013 Ballon d'Or winner has an average of 1.05 goals per game with Real Madrid, significantly higher than during his time at Manchester United (0.40) and Sporting (0.16).

Luis Suarez, meanwhile, will make his home debut when Barcelona host Celta Vigo, according to Mundo Deportivo. 

The former Liverpool striker made his first appearance for the club in their 3-1 Clasico loss, and Luis Enrique looks set to start him again at the Nou Camp.

Real's victory in the Clasico was their 10th straight win in all competitions, and Marca praised the contributions of Ronaldo and Isco, who has been filling in for the injured Gareth Bale.

The Italian newspapers focus primarily on Napoli's clash with Roma, nicknamed the Derby of the Sun.

Napoli beat Fiorentina in the Coppa Italia final in May, but the match was overshadowed by the fatal shooting of Napoli fan Ciro Esposito.

Corriere dello Sport runs with the headline 'Let football be the winner' while Francesco Totti is quoted calling for an end to fan violence.

La Gazzetta dello Sport reveals that although there will be visiting fans, an 1000 extra police have been deployed on the streets of Naples. Their headline says it is 'just a football match' and quotes Esposito's mother as saying: ‘I want to see happy fans, like my Ciro was.’

Juventus are looking to get over their recent poor run of form with a win at Empoli, claim Tuttosport.

Massimo Allegri's side have only won two of their last five games, and have already lost twice in the Champions League. 

After last week's defeat against Genoa, the fans are already voicing their dissatisfaction with the former AC Milan boss. 

Walter Mazzarri may finally be finding his feet again at Inter as his side look for their third straight win when they head to Parma, but the 53-year-old has failed to beat Roberto Donadoni's side in each of his last six attempts.
