Newcastle United could be without top scorer Papiss Cisse until February 21 if he is given a three-match ban or more for elbowing Everton defender Seamus Coleman.

Cisse was charged with violent conduct by the FA on Monday after Sky Sports cameras picked up the striker swinging his elbow in to Coleman's face on three occasions, connecting at least once.

A three-match ban would see him ruled out of the New Year's Day clash at St James' Park against Burnley as well as visits to Leicester in the FA Cup and Chelsea in the Premier League.Â

Burnley (H), Jan 1 - Premier League

Leicester (A), Jan 3 - FA Cup

Chelsea (A), Jan 10 - Premier League

Southampton (H), Jan 17 - Premier League

Hull (A), Jan 31 - Premier League

Stoke (H), Feb 8 - Premier League

Crystal Palace (A), Feb 11 - Premier League

Cisse has until 6pm on Tuesday to respond to the charge and if, as expected, he is banned he could miss Newcastle's next seven matches as he is due to fly out to Equatorial Guinea with Senegal for the Africa Cup of Nations next month.

AFCON runs from January 17 until February 8, meaning Cisse will miss Newcastle's home fixture against Southampton on January 17 and their trip to Hull on January 31.

Should much-fancied Senegal progress to the latter stages then Cisse will also miss the St James' Park clash against Stoke on February 8 and probably the trip to Crystal Palace on February 11.

With the club set to lose manager Alan Pardew to Palace, Cisse's unavailability is a blow they cannot afford.

The forward scored his ninth of the season in the 3-2 win over Everton on Sunday but his elbow on Coleman looks like it will have more significance than that strike come the end of the season.
