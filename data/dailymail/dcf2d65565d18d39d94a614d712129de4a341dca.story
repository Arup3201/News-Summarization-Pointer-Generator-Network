Palmer United Party leader Clive Palmer has lashed back at rebel  senator Jacqui Lambie, accusing her of lying in parliament and scheming to start her own political party.

His claims follow after a parliamentary spiel by the Tasmanian senator, during which she accused her party leader of trying to intimidate her and interfere with her role in the Senate.

But Mr Palmer says those statements are lies and accused Senator Lambie of planning to set up her own political party.

The pair are at odds over Senator Lambie's pledge to vote against all government legislation until a defence force pay deal is reconsidered.

She says she will not be told how to vote by anyone and claims her only boss is the people of Tasmania.

But Mr Palmer says the outspoken senator hasn't brought a single proposal to PUP about Tasmanians or about veterans.

'She just wants to have a fight about nothing which is not a rational way to behave as a respectable senator,' he said in a statement.

Mr Palmer on Wednesday sacked the senator from her party positions of deputy Senate leader and deputy whip and suspended her from all party meetings.

After dropping PUP logos and references from her website, the Tasmanian senator split from her party colleagues in the upper house to vote against the government on a series of motions.

She later accused Mr Palmer of spreading rumours about her and causing her personal distress.

There's speculation Senator Lambie may quit PUP following their public spat, but for now she remains a party member.

Mr Palmer said Senator Lambie had failed to attend party meetings and had not returned his phone calls or spoken to him for a month.

He previously labelled Senator Lambie a 'drama queen' after she accused him of flip-flopping over her stance on Defence pay.
