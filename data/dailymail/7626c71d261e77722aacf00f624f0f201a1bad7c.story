Confronted by a masked burglar in our home in the dead of night, most of us would scream or run away.

When it happened to Viv Hulland, she suggested the intruder join her at the kitchen table for a chat.

The 54-year-old, who works as a professional mediator, said she sensed from the balaclava-clad criminal’s body language that he was as frightened as she was.

Calm: Viv Hulland, 54, calmly sat down with the balaclava-clad intruder she caught in her home and chatted to him at her kitchen table about what he had done

So
she invited him to sit down and spent around ten minutes chatting to 
him before police arrived, pulled off the 17-year-old’s mask and 
arrested him.

Yesterday 
Mrs Hulland – who spends her working day helping families and businesses
resolve conflict and reach agreement –  admitted her behaviour during 
the break-in was ‘bizarre’ but said she acted instinctively. ‘It wasn’t a
conscious decision, it just felt like the right thing to do at the 
time,’ she said. 

‘I could 
see he didn’t mean any harm and he looked terrified. I couldn’t see his 
face but I could just sense it through his body language. He didn’t seem
like a bad lad – he had just done something stupid. It was because of 
that that I felt I could maybe get through to him by talking.’

Mrs
Hulland and her architect husband were asleep in their Leeds home in 
May when they were woken at 2am by the sound of the teenager breaking 
in.

They rang 999 from the
bedroom and when they saw police pull up outside they went downstairs 
to open the electric gates and let them into the garden.

Apology: Ms Hulland later met the 17-year-old as part of the restorative justice programme when the teen told her he was sorry

The
couple then went into the kitchen and came face-to-face with the 
burglar, who ‘leapt out’ in front of them.

Mrs Hulland said they were 
‘very alarmed’, and although the intruder repeatedly told them ‘I’m not 
going to hurt you’ he continued to walk towards them.

But
instead of running, Mrs Hulland suggested they sit down for a chat. 
Moments later, they were talking at the kitchen table and her husband 
Keith, 59, felt it was safe to go and find the police officers.

She
said: ‘We have a big garden and the police got lost trying to find our 
door so my husband had to go and bring them in. He could see the burglar
wasn’t going to harm me. I asked him what he was doing in the house. He
was happy to talk.’

The intruder told her that someone had made him carry out the burglary, but refused to say who.

She said: ‘I felt sad for him, he was only a young lad and he was doing something that could mess up his life for good.’

The teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was later given a nine-month referral order.

He
met Mrs Hulland again under the restorative justice programme, when she
told him the incident had happened hours before her mother’s funeral. 
She said: ‘He was clearly moved and couldn’t speak but then managed to 
say that he was sorry. I just asked him to promise me he would never do 
it again.’

A West 
Yorkshire police spokesman said: ‘It is very rare for a person to be 
confronted by an intruder in their home. Our advice is to call the 
police immediately on 999 and retreat to safety if possible.’
