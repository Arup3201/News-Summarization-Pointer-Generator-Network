Angel di Maria sustained a 'small tear' to his hamstring against Hull City, according to his wife Jorgelina Cardoso.

The Manchester United star limped off at Old Trafford just 14 minutes into the 3-0 victory over the Tigers on Saturday.

Boss Louis van Gaal had revealed Di Maria would 'not be out for six months' straight after the Hull match, but confirmed his £60million summer signing would miss Stoke City's visit to Old Trafford on Tuesday.

And Di Maria's wife has replied to a direct message from a United fan on Instagram to let him know of the couple's disappointment with the injury - but also to reassure supporters that the forward will hopefully return sooner rather than later.

In two messages, Jorgelina Cardoso replied in Spanish: 'No :(.

'There is a small tear (to his hamstring).' 

United host Stoke on Tuesday night looking to close the gap to Southampton, who are third in the Premier League - four points ahead of the Red Devils.

Stoke, meanwhile, could move into the top half of the league if they win at Old Trafford.
