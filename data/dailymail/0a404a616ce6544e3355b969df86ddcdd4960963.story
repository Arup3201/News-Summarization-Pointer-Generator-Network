These are the first pictures to emerge of Amanda Knox's ex-lover and co-defendant Raffaele Sollecito, since the pair were told that they face a retrial over the death of British student Meredith Kercher

Sollecito, 29, appeared relaxed as he was followed by members of the Italian press leaving the University of Verona, where he is studying for his second degree.

Meredith Kercher, 21, was found semi 
naked and with her throat cut in her bedroom of the house she shared 
with Knox in November 2007.

Retrial: Amanda Knox's ex-lover and co-defendant Raffaele Sollecito is pictured leaving the University of Verona, where he is studying for his second degree

Knox and Sollecito, who always 
professed their innocence, were initially found guilty in 2009 and 
sentenced to 26 and 25 years in prison respectively after a trial that 
grabbed headlines around the world.

In 2011, their convictions were quashed after 
forensic experts challenged evidence in the original trial, prompting 
accusations of a botched police investigation and leaving many aspects 
of the killing unexplained.

Sollecito is believed to have been issued with a Swiss residents 
permit, despite him denying his girlfriend's claims that they are move 
to Lugano where they have rented an apartment.

Records show he is now the director of an internet firm called 
'Experience teller media & web management' based near the Swiss city.

Local official Attilo Cometta confirmed that he had applied for a 
residents permit in Decemeber and it was granted the following month.

Sollecito broke cover on Wednesday afternoon as it emerged the judge who cleared him and Knox 
insisted his 'conscience is clear' and there was not enough evidence to
 convict the pair of the brutal murder of a British student.

Judge Hellman
 had cleared them after a fresh review of key DNA evidence revealed a 
catalogue of errors by bungling police scientists who failed to follow 
proper procedure when handling items including not using tweezers, not 
changing gloves and not wearing shoe or hair covers.

It meant that doubt was thrown on two 
key pieces of evidence - a knife on which DNA from Knox was said to have
 been found on the handle and that of Meredith on the tip and a bloodied
 clasp from Meredith's bra said to have traces of Sollecito on it.

Their
 defence lawyers managed to successfully argue that their was a real 
risk of contamination and that as such the evidence should not be used 
to convict American Knox, 25 and her former boyfriend computer studies 
graduate Sollecito, 29.

Judge
 Hellman added: 'We need to see what the reasons were for the Supreme 
Court in ordering the retrial. We need to see if they have ruled whether
 mistakes were made in my proceedings or rulings but I don't think so.

'Were my conclusions insufficient, contradictory or illogical ? One thing is certain there was no proof of guilt.

'If I was the prosecution I would have acted exactly as they did. They didn't make any mistakes. It's just that we evaluated the evidence differently.

'The law says that just one little, reasonable doubt is enough to clear. We (panel of other judges) were all in agreement with our thinking.'

'In 2011 just hours after he had 
cleared Knox and Sollecito, judge Hellmann again raised eyebrows by 
giving an interview to Corriere Della Sera in which he said of the 
verdict: "It is the result of the truth that was created in the 
proceedings.

'But the real truth may be different. They may be responsible, but the evidence is not there.

'What we considered during the trial we didn't consider sufficient to convict.'

Following the acquittal of the pair judge Hellmann issued a 142 page report in which he condemned police and prosecutors for their methods of questioning, sloppy investigation and outlandish theories.'

Mr Cometta said: 'The judicial proceedings he is facing in Italy have no impact on his permit he is free to come and go - it is up to the Italian to decide if they want to impose any restrictions on his movements.'

No date has been sent for the retrial of Knox and Sollecito which will take place in Florence and not the hill top town of Perugia where Meredith, from Coulsdon, Surrey, was found dead in November 2007.

In 2009 Knox and Sollecito were found guilty of murder and sexual assault and sentenced to 26 and 25 years respectively but they were set free by judge Hellmann in 2011 and she is now living in Seattle while he is currently in the northern Italian city of Verona.
