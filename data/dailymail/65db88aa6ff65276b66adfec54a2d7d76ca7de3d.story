In an effort to get more Aussies interested in their newest fast-food fare, McDonald's Australia has set up a pop-up restaurant in the shape of a gigantic lunchbox.

The massive red and yellow box is currently in Federation Square, Melbourne and will pop up in the Gold Coast, Sydney, Adelaide and Perth.

The mobile restaurant will be handing out free AUD $3 (£1.60)  mini steak taster wraps as part of the restaurant's efforts to highlight the new steak offerings on the menu.

Unlike the steak products on the US menu – which are chopped steak – the offerings Down Under feature marinated and slow-cooked pieces of rump steak.

Last week McDonald's revealed that worldwide sales dropped by 30 per cent in the third quarter. 

Australia remains one of the company's four troubled markets along with the US, Germany and Japan.

The world's largest restaurant chain has recently been plagued with a string of bad news stories – the latest being the expired beef and chicken products being sold by a local supplier to McDonald's China.

As more and more consumers turn their backs on the Golden Arches, the company was forced to launch its first ever consumer outreach exercise, inviting customers to ask questions on their Our Food Your Questions website.

In the UK however, the figures have gone up. 'People are a bit sniffy about the brand, but it delivers,' Peter Martin from CGA Peach told The Guardian.

The figures show that 56% of British adults have visited a McDonald's restaurant at least once in the last six months.

'It is easily the number one choice for couples with kids. It is still working, without a doubt.'

The new menu in Australia includes two new McWraps (Steak & Garlic Aioli, and Steak and BBQ), a steak salad with Thai-style dressing, and a steak and egg wrap.

McDonald's has more than 35,600 restaurants worldwide. 81 percent of those are franchised.
