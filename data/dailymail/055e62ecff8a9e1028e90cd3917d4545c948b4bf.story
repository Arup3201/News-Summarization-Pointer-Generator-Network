‘I’m happy playing alongside all the different guys because I’m very comfortable with all of them. I’ve played with Paddy and he is a player with a big future.

‘Tyler has impressed too. But I just love being on the pitch and I really don’t mind who I play with.’

‘It’s the biggest league in the Europe and probably the world. I’ve always loved watching Premier League football and wanted to play here.

‘The football is very direct, quick and physical, which makes it attractive for the fans. I really like playing here – I’m relishing the challenge.’
