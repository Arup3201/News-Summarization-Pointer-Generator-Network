Predator: Cyril Smith is said to have abused boys for decades

The MP who blew the whistle on Sir Cyril Smith’s four decades of child abuse last night demanded a full public inquiry into the scandal.

As police announced a probe into an alleged cover-up of Smith’s activities in Rochdale, Labour’s Simon Danczuk said a wider probe was needed to examine how far the network of paedophiles extended and how the political establishment kept it quiet.

He said the Lib Dems must reveal all the information they had at the time about the abuse.

The call for a public inquiry will put more pressure on Lord Steel – the party’s leader in the late Seventies and Eighties – who has claimed he knew nothing of the allegations.

Mr Danczuk, whose book Smile For The Camera: The Double Life Of Cyril Smith was serialised in the Mail this month, said: ‘What we need is a much larger public inquiry that looks at what Smith was involved in, not just in Rochdale but the cover-up in London and elsewhere.

‘Look at what happened to Smith, what he was involved in. Look at who he was in networks with in terms of this type of abuse and also take evidence from elsewhere and look at the wider cover-up.’

Writing in today’s Mail, he adds: ‘Make no mistake: The identities of many of these men have long been known to the police. They must be made to face the law before, like Smith himself, death allows them to escape scot free.

‘Smith’s sphere of influence stretched far beyond Rochdale. I believe he was part of a VIP paedophile ring which was active in London and other parts of the country, with protectors at the highest level of the Establishment.’

Senior Lib Dems including Nick Clegg have said they knew little of the true extent of Smith’s abuse, except for a report in the Rochdale Alternative Press in 1979.

Mr Clegg has said he sees no need for an internal inquiry, claiming it is a matter for police. Mr Danczuk’s book tells of appalling events at Knowl View residential school in Rochdale where boys say they were abused by Smith and other men.

Accused: Sir Cyril Smith, who died at 82 in a nursing home in Rochdale in 2010, is also said to have abused boys at privately-run hostel Cambridge House

The school has closed but there have long been suspicions that the scandal of what happened there was suppressed, in part, to protect Smith.

Nine men have come forward to tell police they were abused at Knowl View from the 1970s. Eight more claim they were abused in the 1960s at Cambridge House, a  privately-run hostel for boys.

Sir Cyril, who died at 82 in a nursing home in Rochdale in 2010, is also said to have abused boys at Cambridge House, and was secretary of the association that ran it.

Smith had links to several schools, including Knowl View, where he was said to hold a set of keys and could visit when he liked.

During this time, three files about alleged child abuse were passed to the director of public prosecutions, but without result.

Yesterday, Sir Peter Fahy, Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, said his force would also conduct an inquiry into allegations that Rochdale Council, which had responsibility for Knowl View, had covered up sex abuse claims. He added: ‘As a result of the publicity and the discussion around the book recently published about child abuse in Rochdale, we are carrying out a review into those allegations and other matters of public debate around that book to see whether that justifies a criminal investigation into allegations of cover-up.’

Rochdale Council said it was also widening the scope of its own inquiry into Knowl View in light of Mr Danczuk’s book. But last night the care worker who blew the whistle on abuse at the school in 1994 condemned police and the council.

Martin Digan, the school’s head of care, said: ‘Police and the council have had evidence of the abuse that went on for two decades but all they have done is cover it up.

‘They have documents that clearly show Knowl View was a sweet shop for paedophiles who would travel the country to come and abuse boys there, and yet 20 years later we are still waiting for these abusers to be brought to justice. It is not only an insult to the victims, it is an insult to society itself.’

In 2000, Manchester Police carried out a ‘comprehensive investigation’ into abuse claims at Knowl View which led to the conviction of one man for indecent assault and gross indecency. They said there was insufficient evidence to charge any others and no specific allegations were made against Smith.

However, last year the Crown Prosecution Service said that under today’s guidelines Smith would have been charged.

Mr Danczuk’s call came as victims of the sex-abuse scandal accused the police of ‘abandoning’ them. Despite having the names of 11 suspected child abusers for 18 months, Sir Peter admitted his force had failed to question any of them.

Cyril Smith and his friend Harry Wild were among a gang of abusers who for years beat and raped boys at Knowl View, a residential school for vulnerable children.

Both were school governors who had a set of keys and they would saunter around  eyeing up young boys and watching them as they showered.

Smith and Wild, a 6ft 5in former Territorial Army officer who was a Tory councillor, attacked victims as young as seven.

The school for those with learning difficulties opened in 1969 and was described as a ‘sweet shop for paedophiles’. But when a whistleblower on the staff of the 50-bed facility in Rochdale raised concerns, he was threatened with the sack.

According to Simon Danczuk’s book, head of care Martin Digan became aware of the visits by Smith and Wild, who died in  2001 aged 80.

Mr Digan said he complained four times but his concerns were dismissed and he was threatened with the sack. Matters came to a head in 1992 when a ten-year-old boy,  shaking with fright, told Mr Digan he had been sexually assaulted.

The youngster started to describe Wild’s usual attire of a Crombie coat and black  polished boots. Mr Digan called the police, who arrived quickly but failed to take the matter further.

In the headmaster’s unlocked office, Mr Digan found and copied a devastating report written by an HIV prevention officer which warned that pupils were at risk of Aids. This meant, Mr Digan said, that the boys had been abused by paedophile gangs. ‘They were like lambs to the slaughter,’ he said.Mr Digan said education and social services chiefs were made aware but ‘the action that was taken was zero’.

The HIV report, not naming Smith or Wild, was later published and the scandal forced Knowl View’s closure in 1994. But Mr Digan then received phone calls threatening his children. He is adamant Smith – who had failed in a bid to run the school privately when it was closed by Rochdale Council – was behind it all.
