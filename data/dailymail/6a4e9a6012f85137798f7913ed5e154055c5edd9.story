Attack: Retired nurse Llinos Rees, 61, who was caught on camera attacking her own mother

A son who suspected that his elderly mother was being abused installed a hidden camera which revealed his own sister spitting in her face.

The footage caught Llinos Rees, 61, attacking their elderly mother Mary Gwen Jones, a court heard.

The retired nurse was filmed ripping her mother's clothes, repeatedly spitting, screaming and elbowing her.

Mrs Jones' son Arwel Jones had the camera fitted in the kitchen because he feared she was being attacked.

The victim had been living on her own in Denbigh, North Wales, since her husband died 18 years ago and is frail but in good health.

Prosecutor Rhian Jackson told magistrates at Prestatyn that Mrs Jones told her son that his sister had been behaving badly towards her, screaming at her whenever she visited.

He noticed that she was very upset after each of his sisterâ€™s visits.

Since retiring last year after 42 years 
as a nurse Rees visited her mother more frequently and, according to Mrs
 Jones, was verbally aggressive.

After speaking to social workers, Mr Jones decided to install a covert CCTV camera and on May 21 his mother asked him to visit as Rees had been worse than ever.

She had been yelling at her and calling her a 'b****'.

Mrs Jackson told the court: 'Arwel Jones was shocked and distressed by the footage.'

When interviewed by police, Rees said she had never got on with her brother but admitted spitting and losing her temper.

Dafydd Roberts, defending, said it was a sad case not only because the victim was a vulnerable 91-year-old but also because the defendant was highly regarded in her community and the offence was totally out of character.

He said she had taken unpaid leave to care for her mother some years ago when she was diagnosed with cancer.

'But there has been disagreement within the family for some time,' he said.

'Mr Jones also provided some care, but not as much as my client.'

Mr Roberts said that Rees had 'simply been ground down' by the stress and criticism and he submitted several character references.

Rees, of Peniel, near Denbigh, wept after admitting assault at an earlier hearing.

Chairman Isfryn Williams, imposed a 12 month community sentence, and said: 'It is a very sad case and I think everybody can relate to it in some way.'

Rees was ordered to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work and attend five sessions on stress management.

Magistrates also imposed a 12-month restraining order preventing Rees from visiting her mother except with a member of her family present.
