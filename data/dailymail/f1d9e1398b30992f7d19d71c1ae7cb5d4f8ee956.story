A Labour parliamentary candidate backed by Harriet Harman was last night kicked out of the party after The Mail on Sunday discovered she had posted a string of obscene and vitriolic messages on Twitter. 

Deborah Hopkins used the social networking site to accuse the Conservatives of ‘killing the sick’ and ‘starving the disabled’, claimed a Government department was using ‘starvation’ to control the population, and described the British Empire as ‘genocide’. 

She even used an extremely offensive swear word to attack an opponent, writing: ‘I’d call you a **** but you have neither the depth or the warmth.’

Ms Hopkins, who was due to stand for St Austell and Newquay in next year’s General Election, addressed last year’s party conference in Brighton and has been publicly supported by Ms Harman and her husband Jack Dromey, the Shadow Housing Minister.

After meeting Ed Miliband and shaking his hand, she wrote: ‘May never wash that hand again.’

Both Ms Harman – Labour’s Deputy Leader – and Mr Dromey have posed for pictures with Ms Hopkins, with Mr Dromey posting a message on Twitter describing her as ‘a great champion of Cornwall’.

But after this newspaper brought Ms Hopkins’s offensive messages to the attention of Labour’s high command yesterday, she was suspended from the party – rendering her ineligible to contest the election. Ms Hopkins, a 47-year-old single mother with a teenage son, posted the messages after being selected to fight the seat last autumn.

In October, she reacted to the news that the Coalition had voted down planned firearms restrictions with the message: ‘Murdering b*******’.

A few weeks later, when the Conservatives published their goals for society, such as ‘caring for one’s neighbour and good manners’, Ms Hopkins responded with her own mock slogan: ‘Killing the sick, starving the disabled, evicting the poor, destroying the hopes of children, stealing billions from the public’. 

In the same month, during a debate 
over Britain’s imperial past, she accused a fellow Twitter user of being
 ‘proud of the genocide that was and is Empire. Sickening.’ And earlier 
this year she asked whether Iain Duncan Smith’s Department for Work and 
Pensions was using benefit cuts to try to achieve ‘population control by
 starvation’.

Ms Hopkins, a 
healthcare assistant, has already admitted that she voted for the local 
sitting MP, Liberal Democrat Stephen Gilbert, at the last election – but
 claimed it was because she ‘believed their lies and believed it was the
 only way to keep the Tories out’.

She said she decided to stand for election after meeting Mr Dromey last May and being ‘inspired’ by his anger upon hearing how she struggled to make ends meet.

‘I was very frustrated by some politicians who didn’t seem angry enough about what was going on,’ she said. ‘I thought, “If you’re allowed to be a politician and still be angry, then it might be for me.” ’

In a statement last night, Ms Hopkins said: ‘I appreciate the language used in some of my tweets is offensive and not appropriate. I don’t wish to embarrass the Labour Party and apologise for any offence caused.’

A Labour spokesperson said: ‘We take matters such as these extremely seriously. Deborah Hopkins has been suspended from the Labour Party, pending further investigation.’

Tory MP Henry Smith said Ms Hopkins’s behaviour called into question the judgment of her supporters. ‘This vile and malicious language is unacceptable from a woman who was seeking to take on the huge privilege of representing the people of St Austell and Newquay,’ he said.

‘This calls into question the judgment of Harriet Harman and Jack Dromey, who publicly supported Ms Hopkins’s candidacy. They should be much more careful about whom they select in future.’
