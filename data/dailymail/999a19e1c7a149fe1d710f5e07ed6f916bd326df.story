An urn said to contain the remnants of Buddha has been stolen from its shrine in Udong, Cambodia, pictured above

A golden urn believed to contain the remnant of Budda's body has been stolen from its shrine in Cambodia.

Officials in the south east Asian country said the relics, which have enormous religion and cultural significance for Cambodians, were taken from the mountain shrine close to the capital Phnom Penh.

A government spokesman called for those responsible to be brought to justice.

He said: 'This relic has been respected by 
Buddhist followers for thousands of years.

'This theft cannot be accepted. The perpetrator and any associates who 
connived to commit such a crime must be prosecuted according to the law 
of Cambodia.'

Police said a guard was woken by a barking dog on Tuesday.

It was then the guard discovered the lock to the shrine's door had been damaged and the urn had disappeared.

Officers quizzed 13 of the shrine's guards and detained six as suspects, but said the authorities had no information about the relics' location.

The relics were moved by the late King Norodom Sihanouk in 2002 from Phnom Penh to the mountain shrine in the former royal city of Udong in a ceremony attended by tens of thousands of people.

Several countries in Asia 
possess relics believed to come from the body of Buddha.

The urn was housed inside one of four stupas - a mound-like or semi-hemispherical structure containing Buddhist relics - in the city of Udong, the former capital of Cambodia.

Perched in the hills around 22 miles from Phnom Penh, the city was the home of the royal family between 1618 and 1866.

At the northwestern corner of the hill four stupas can be seen piercing the skyline.

The first is the tomb of King Monivong (r.1927 to 1941). The second is said to be the tomb of King Ang Duog (r. 1845-59) and the third is the tomb of King Sorivopor (r. prior to 1618).

The fourth stupa is where the urn, which is said to contain Buddha's remains, was stored.

Siddhartha Gautama Buddha, known simply as Buddha, was a sage or wise person, on whose teachings the religion of Buddhism was founded.

Buddha means the 'awakened one' or the 'enlightened one'.

Buddhism is the story of one man's spiritual journey to enlightenment, and the teachings that derived from it.

Historians have estimated Siddhartha Gautama lived between 490 BCE and circa 410 BCE.

He was born into a royal family in a Nepalese village in the foothills of the Himalayas.

It is said that having lived in a royal palace, Siddhartha Gautama, had been sheltered from seeing those struck down by illness and poverty.

Having married and fathered a child he ventured from the royal enclosure where he is said to have laid eyes on a sick man, an old man and a corpse, for the first time.

He learned age, sickness and death are inevitable for everyone.

On his trip he came across a monk and saw the encounter as a sign he should leave his fortunate life and live as a homeless holy man.

Depriving himself of life's luxuries and living in a state of extreme abstinence for six years did not provide him with an answer to escaping suffering in the world.

Instead Siddhartha Gautama found a middle way living his life between poverty and luxury.

It is said that when he was sitting underneath a Bodhi tree, Siddhartha became deeply immersed in meditation, reflecting on life.

It was then that he achieved enlightenment and became Buddha.

The site at which Buddha achieved enlightenment, the Mahabodhi Temple, is now a pilgrimage site.

Buddha spent his life teaching and the religion to this day focuses on the importance of teaching.
