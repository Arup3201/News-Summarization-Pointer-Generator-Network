Leyton Orient football player Billy Lobjoit outside St Albans Crown Court in Hertfordshire. He used his own car as a getaway vehicle

A promising young footballer used his own Smart Car as a getaway vehicle after his friend carried out armed robberies.

Billy Lobjoit, a striker with League one side Leyton Orient, drove his friend away from the scene of two armed holdups and shops.

After the second police had a description that the robbers were using a distinctive white Smart Car.

As a result police responding to a 999 call quickly discovered the vehicle and Lobjoyt was arrested.

At St Albans crown court Lobjoit, 19, was given a suspended sentence when he appeared in the dock to admit two offences of robbery.

But judge John Plumstead also told him that for the next six months he would not be allowed to go into licensed premises on Fridays and Saturday after 7pm.

The judge said it meant he would not be able to go drinking with team mates after a match.

In addition Lobjoit was handed an 18 month jail sentence which was suspended for two years, disqualified from driving for two years and ordered to pay compensation of £395 to victims of the robberies.

His co defendant and friend Sam Rothery 19 who had actually gone into the shops with his face disguised behind a mask and wearing a beanie hat was jailed for 29 months and 27 days.

Judge Plumstead passed the sentence after being told Rothery wanted to rejoin the army and there was a chance he would be accepted if he received a sentence under 30 months.

Rothery of Borehamwood admitted four charges of robbery and two of possessing a bladed article.

The court heard it was on the 12th of November when on his own he carried out a knife point robbery at the Co-op store in Bishops Rise, Hatfield.

He was on his own and after jumping over the counter snatched £429 from the till and 12 packs of tobacco worth £50.

Then on November 15 he carried out a second lone robbery on the Co-op store in Organ Hall Road, Borehamwood, Herts

On this occasion he took a bottle of champagne and more cigarettes.

Twenty minutes later and having enlisted the help of his friend Lobjoyt he staged another robbery at the Londis Store in High Street, Elstree.

It was just after 8pm and on this occasion he took a bottle of Bells whiskey and more packets of cigarettes.

As he left the store he was seen to get into a white Smart Car driven by Lobjoit of Park Street, St Albans.

Then at 9.15pm that same evening Rothery staged another robbery at the Co-op store in park Street St Albans and took £450 from the till.

Once more Lobjoit was outside in the Smart car which was registered to him.

Witnesses saw Rothery free from the shop and jump into the vehicle.

For six months he is banned from licensed premises on Fridays and Saturday after 7pm. Judge said it meant he would 'not be able to go drinking with team mates'

Details of the vehicle were given to police and it wasn't long afterwards that officers saw the car in Chippendale Lane St Albans and stopped it.

Rothery ran off from the scene, but gave himself up a few days later.Lobjoit was arrested saying his friend had given him £90 to drive him that night.

The court was told that Rothery had been a promising young soldier but had left the army to look after his mum who was suffering from severe depression.

But unable to find work he had fallen into the wrong crowd and as a result found himself in debt to serious criminals.

It was because of that he had committed the robberies as a way of paying them off.

Sentencing the pair Judge Plumstead told Rothery he hoped that by sending him to prison for a day short of thirty months, it might help him get back into the army.

He told Lobjoit that when Rothery had approached him for help that evening, he hadn't known initially that he would be committing robberies armed with a knife.

'You drove your own car and this wasn't thought through and this wasn't sophisticated.'

He told them people in stores and shops late at night performed a vital role in the community and were vulnerable and deserved the protection of the courts.
