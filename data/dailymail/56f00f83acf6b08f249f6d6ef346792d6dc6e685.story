A British wine merchant has created the world's first insect and wine matching guide.

As well as pairing Chardonnay to tarantulas, buyers at Laithwaite's Wine matched sparkling rose to barbecued locusts, sherry to giant waterbugs and Shiraz to sago worms.

Traditional food in parts of Asia, Latin America and Africa, edible insects are now being touted as the new superfood due to their high protein content.

Buyers at Laithwaite's Wine have created the world's first insect and wine matching guide

It's a pairing game: Ten of of Laithwaite's 1,500 wines were matched to popular edible insects

The buyers at the wine merchants paired ten of Laithwaite's 1,500 wines to popular bugs.

'We did our research on it and those are the bestselling edible insects,' a spokesperson from Leiths told MailOnline Food.

The edible bugs were sourced from gourmet insect shops Crunchy Critters and Edible Uniques as well as from Selfridges and Harvey Nichols.  

Bugs are fast becoming a fixture in upscale restaurants: The best restaurant in the world, Noma in Copenhagen serves its beef tartare with ants; Michelin-starred chef David Faure's alternative menu in his restaurant Aphrodite in France dishes up pate with a side of crickets and London's Archipelago has chocolate-covered locusts on offer.

'Insects have been the tradition in Mexican food since the Aztecs. They have been eaten in Mexico for hundreds of years,' Chef Benito Molina, of Manzanilla Restaurant, Mexico City said to MailOnline Food. 

'I think the most important thing that people have to understand is that insects are a very sustainable protein source.' 

A growing appetite for bugs: Two billion people worldwide supplement their daily diet with high protein bugs

Mealworms, which have a nutty taste and crunchy texture, are matched with with a crisp Clare Valley Viognier

Beth Willard, Wine Buyer at Laithwaite's said: 'On average each buyer will try over 10,000 bottles of wine a year across the world, but we never envisaged making our final selection with insects in mind. There's clearly a growing appetite for them.'

'When you consider that many of the words used to describe the aroma of wine – earthy, grassy, floral – can also be used to describe the bugs' habitats, it's no surprise that wine can really complement the distinctive tastes of insects. The word 'full bodied' will never be the same!'

A recent UN report identified edible insects as a sustainable food source for the future. Figures indicate two billion people worldwide already supplement their diet with them.

 

Asian Forest Scorpion - Scorpions have a strong, bitter flavor and are normally eaten with sweet chili sauce. Paris Street Rose is full of rich sweet fruit made from full bodied Transylvanian Pinot Noir, so it will have enough body to cut through the combination of flavours.

Mealworms - Match their nutty taste and light, crunchy texture with a crisp Clare Valley Viognier wine that has just the right combination of fruit and richness.

Zebra Tarantula - Tarantulas are normally eaten deep fried, so think similar to fish and chips. A lively full bodied Chardonnay will stand up to the complex fishy flavours of the tarantula.

Sago Worms - These worms have a distinct taste a bit similar to bacon so you need a big meaty red with loads of punch to match that savoury flavour. McLaren Vale Shiraz is fresh with loads of red fruit and spice

BBQ Locusts - Locusts taste a bit like an exotic bar snack and with the BBQ flavour you'll need a wine with a hint of sweetness. The Hacienda de Lluna Moscatel is a gorgeous lightly bubbly pink that works well as an aperitif.

Chocolate dipped locusts - These locusts are essentially a savory dish as they taste a bit like sunflower seeds, but also have the sweetness from the chocolate. A rich robust wine with loads of sweet fruit will stand up to these flavours. 

Giant Waterbugs -  The meat inside the water bug's body tastes a bit similar to a sweet scallop, while the head has hints of anise, so you'll need to find a wine that can match well with seafood and stronger flavours. A dry sherry, and a Fino at that, is the only choice here. The crisp citrus and nutty flavours will complement their complex flavours.

Queen Weaver Ants - Their slightly sour and crunchy tastes like a lemon. They would go well with an aromatic white with pretty fruit and floral notes. A Gewürztraminer provides the perfect balance to crunchy textures.

Asian Forest Scorpion - Scorpions have a strong, bitter flavor and are normally eaten with sweet chili sauce. Paris Street Rose is full of rich sweet fruit made from full bodied Transylvanian Pinot Noir, so it will have enough body to cut through the combination of sweet and sour. 

 Crickets - The flavours are much harder to distinguish in crickets and so they are often prepared with garlic and salt. Nevertheless the nutty flavor that comes through means a perfect fit is a rich full-bodied white wine like Albariño.

Garlic Chapulines - Have an earthy and grassy flavour and a very crunchy texture, therefore we recommend a creamy dry Champagne that will match well with the earthy flavours (similar to matching with mushrooms) and crunch.
