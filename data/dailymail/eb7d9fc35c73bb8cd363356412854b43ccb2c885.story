At 7.30pm, Michelle Scoffings put her three-year-old daughter to bed with a slight temperature.

Just before midnight, Erica woke up and asked for a drink. If she hadn’t, she would not be alive today.

Mrs Scoffings noticed the little girl’s temperature had soared and there were purple blotches all over her body.

She and her husband Michael 
immediately performed one of the key tests for meningitis – pressing a 
clear glass against the skin to see if the rash fades under pressure.

It did not, so the couple from Chesterfield bundled Erica into the family car and drove her straight to hospital.

Doctors diagnosed meningococcal septicaemia and said she might have only three hours to live.

Both of her legs went black and she 
was placed in intensive care with bandaged limbs and drips keeping her 
alive. Amazingly she pulled through, and is now firmly on the road to 
recovery after months of hospital treatment.

Mrs Scoffings kept a remarkable photo 
diary of her daughter’s brush with death and has made it public to raise
awareness of how quickly meningitis can take hold.

It was in January that Erica 
complained of feeling poorly and her mother put it down to a stomach 
bug. By the time Erica went to bed she was feeling better and looked 
fine. Yet when she woke up four hours later she complained that she 
could not move.

‘I took the quilt off her and saw the purple marks,’ said her mother, who has seven other children.

‘Me and my husband did the glass test 
and then rushed to hospital. Not ringing and waiting for an ambulance 
was the best thing we could have done.

‘You have to get to the hospital quickly and getting there in ten minutes made a difference.

‘It happened so quickly, we didn’t 
have time to think. I was terrified as there was nothing I could do. 
Every time someone touched her she screamed.

Erica, 3, was just three hours from death after she contracted meningitis

'There were so many doctors 
and medical staff in the room at the hospital. I was in shock but 
surrounded by my family.

‘Erica was screaming and I felt 
helpless. I just had to sit there and watch and as a parent that is the 
worst thing that can happen.’

Later that night Erica was transferred
from Chesterfield Royal Hospital to the intensive care unit at 
Sheffield Children’s Hospital.Her legs went black as the septicaemia ate
away at her flesh, exposing the bone.

‘We expected her to just go on to a 
drip but we didn’t expect her to go into intensive care,’ said Mrs 
Scoffings. ‘It was the septicaemia which made it so much worse. It was 
awful.

‘Erica was screaming all the time. I was a mess when the surgeon said she might have to have both legs amputated.

‘That was a last resort but it was definitely a possibility. Both her legs and her right hand were completely black.’

Erica was transferred to a specialist 
burns unit as the effect on her limbs was similar to severe burns, and 
she underwent skin grafts. Amputation was prevented by ‘vacuum therapy’,
which encouraged the tissue to cover the bone.

Mrs Scoffings added: ‘The NHS have been fantastic. They told us everything that was happening.

‘Erica is so bubbly and  intelligent. 
She kept saying, “One day I will walk again, Mummy” and we stayed really
positive throughout the whole situation.

‘She understands that she has been 
poorly but she has her appetite back now. She is a bit unsteady on her 
feet and will need splints to walk properly.’

Erica spent two weeks in hospital and 
has since returned three times for skin graft operations. But less than 
eight months after being struck down by the illness, she is due to start
nursery next month.

‘If it wasn’t for the glass test then 
we wouldn’t have known what was wrong,’ said her mother.

‘I don’t know 
what would have happened if she hadn’t called out for a drink that 
evening.’
