It's 20 years since Blackburn Rovers were crowned champions of England. A replica Premiership trophy sits on display at Ewood Park and there is a statue to Jack Walker, the local millionaire who made it all possible.

Dotted around the club that Jack built are memories of those heady days when Shearer, Sutton and Sherwood helped seize the title from Manchester United.

Sadly, there is little else left of Blackburn’s former glory. Today, they are £80million in debt, operating under a transfer embargo and still taking orders from India.

Gary Bowyer has overseen the slow climb back towards respectability after relegation from Premier League

The fierce opposition to Venky’s has subsided but the mistakes made by the chicken farming family from Pune in those first catastrophic years in charge continue to haunt their football club; the sacking of Sam Allardyce, relegation from the top-flight, boardroom battles and reckless spending.

Blackburn’s rookie owners talked about qualifying for the Champions League and signing Ronaldinho, but became a laughing stock. They have learned a painful lesson and adopt a significantly lower profile these days.

Meanwhile the manager who has overseen the slow climb back towards respectability – though still a million miles from prosperity – seems remarkably laid-back for someone asked to work with at least one hand tied behind his back.

Gary Bowyer twice stepped in as caretaker after Henning Berg and Michael Appleton were sacked in the tumultuous 2012-13 season before getting the job on a permanent basis.

‘At the time it was nothing short of a mess,’ says Bowyer. ‘There were a lot of people who were quick to jump on the bandwagon and call the club at any second.

‘We’re not stupid or naïve, I understand why. But I think that’s credit to the owners. They’ve made progress, educated themselves, learned lessons and improved. I think that’s why they have been out of the papers for 18 months.

‘The task was obviously to bring credibility back to the football club which we’ve done, but there’s still a long way to go.

‘We’ve stabilised it from where it was. But that doesn’t mean that it’s in the place we want it to be. Now we need to kick on and go again.’

The trips to India to speak to the owners are less frequent these days. Bowyer has not been over there for two months.

But the transfer embargo imposed for breaching Financial Fair Play rules prohibits Venky’s from throwing more money at the problem even if they want to.  

The club were relegated in 2010-11 and the supporters were vehemently opposed to Venky's 

It means that he is spending the transfer window fending off bids for his best players instead of signing new ones to get back into the top-flight.

Even if Crystal Palace meet Blackburn’s £5m valuation of their top scorer Rudy Gestede, it won’t knock much of a hole in the £79.8m debt. The figure is almost twice what Venky’s paid to buy the club in 2010.

Bowyer has done his bit to steady the ship and only narrowly missed out on the playoffs last season.

But there’s a thin line between stability and mediocrity in the eyes of some supporters, and he was booed after the recent defeat to Wolves as Blackburn continued on a disappointing run that has brought just won win in the last eight Championship games.

‘We said it would take time and that’s something the supporters have to be extremely aware of,’ he said.

‘Of course the debt makes it more difficult, there’s no denying that. The teams above us are all looking to spend big in this window if you believe the figures and we can’t compete with that.

‘But that’s the job. I was aware of what was coming, and we just get on with it.

‘I can’t control other clubs showing interest in our players. I just sit there and tick the days off on my calendar in the office and ignore my phone calls!’ 

Bowyer was twice caretaker manager after the sackings of Henning berg and Michael Appleton in the tumultuous 2012-13 season before being appointed permanent manager

On Saturday, Blackburn can enjoy a rare moment back in the spotlight when they face Swansea City in the lunchtime tie, having held Manchester City to a draw here in the third round last season.

Sadly, according to Dan Clough from the club fanzine 4,000 Holes, the cup competitions might be Rovers’ only opportunity of rubbing shoulders with the elite of English football from now on.

‘The fans’ previous experience of a takeover was extremely positive with Jack Walker,’ said Clough. ‘For it to go the way it has is even more disappointing.

‘But pre-1985, we were a Second Division club until there was a massive injection of cash. In terms of the size of the town, you can’t say we deserve to be in the top-flight.

‘The fans were spoiled a bit and it couldn’t last forever. Some of them won’t be too surprised if we never get back up again.'
