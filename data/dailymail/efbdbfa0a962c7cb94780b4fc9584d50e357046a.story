A six-year-old boy was buried today in St. Louis after he was killed last week in an gun attack his parents say stemmed from a traffic dispute.

Marcus Johnson Jr visited O'Fallon Park with his parents, four siblings, and other friends and family members while recovering from heart surgery one week earlier. He had a post-operation appointment the day he was killed. 

Police are searching for the occupants of a car who shot at the family's minivan as they left the north St Louis park in a minivan at about 7.30pm on March 11. 

Marcus Johnson Jr.'s parents figured a day at a city park was just what the 6-year-old kindergartner needed while recovering from heart surgery the previous week. Instead, his family buried Marcus today after the child was shot in the chest and killed in an attack his mother and father said stemmed from a traffic dispute

Marcus Johnson Sr. said he returned fire in self-defense as the rolling shootout continued for several blocks. Marcus's 15-year-old brother and a 69-year-old family friend were also wounded.

'My baby already had stress to live in this world, and for somebody to take his life away is wrong,' mother Quiana Johnson told the St Louis Post Dispatch.

She said that Marcus, who was in kindergarten, had suffered from a heart ailment since birth. His family had to watch him closely because he was taking blood-thinning drugs so he had to be careful not to get bruised. 

'He was a happy, happy, loving and caring kid,' she told the St Louis Post Dispatch. 'Through his sickness he was happy.' 

The day of the shooting, the family had piled into their recently purchased 2006 Pontiac Montana and headed to the park. Quiana Johnson said it 'was a nice day' and that it gave them a chance to 'get out of the house and do some things as a family'. 

She said that as they were leaving, her husband saw someone he knew and stopped his vehicle to chat, annoying another man who was stuck because of the traffic. 

Quiana Johnson said the man told them it was his 'hood' and that the family shouldn't hold up traffic. 

Marcus suffered from a heart ailment and had surgery the week before he was shot. He had been at a post-operation appointment prior to going to the park. His mother said he was taking blood-thinning drugs and had to be careful not to get bruised

The family returned to the car and as they drove to the exit of the park, the man followed them and began shooting. 

Quiana Johnson had a gun on her - which she had recently bought because of a fear of break-ins in her neighborhood - and when she noticed her son had been shot, she handed it to her husband.

'I told him that if he didn't shoot back, they will kill us all,' she told the St Louis Post Dispatch. 

She crawled to the back of the van, where her son had been shot and the rest of her family members were huddling. 

'I said, "little Marcus, wake up. Don't go to sleep. Mommy is right here with you. Wake up." He was trying,' she said. 

Once they escaped the shooting they called the police who took Marcus to Barnes-Jewish Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. 

Funeral arrangements were taken care of at Ronald L Jones Funeral Chapel in St Louis.   

Johnson said Marcus, his youngest son, was diagnosed with a heart ailment as an infant.
