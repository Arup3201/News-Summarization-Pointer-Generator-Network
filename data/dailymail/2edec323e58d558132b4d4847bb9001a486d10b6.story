Jael Strauss, a former contestant on America's Next Top Model who has spent six years desperate and homeless struggling with a drug addiction, has finally agreed to go to rehab.

Close to losing her battle with methamphetamine, Dr Phil staged an intervention with the 28-year-old in what was a last ditch effort to help the once aspiring model save her own life.

After 'the full blown meth addict' initially resisted all help, running off the stage and out onto the Paramount lot in tears, Dr Phil finally convinced her to seek the treatment she needs in an emotional episode that aired today.

From model to meth: Jael Strauss, a former contestant on America's Next Top Model who has spent six years desperate and homeless struggling with a drug addiction, finally agreed to go to rehab on Dr Phil

With Ms Strauss missing and living on the 
streets, Dr. Phil initially sent her father, Larry, and mother, Lisa, go to her 
hometown with the hope of finding her. Reluctantly, she agreed to travel
to Los Angeles to see Dr. Phil.

However, after she is seen physically 
resisting being placed on the Dr Phil stage, she then runs away, inconsolable.

Dr.
Phil decides to follow her, and makes a point of noting: 'This is the first time 
in ten years I've come out here, [and it's] to talk to you.'

After reasoning with Ms Strauss, 
explaining that he genuinely wants to help her to help herself, she agrees to re-enter the stage.

'You do what it takes, and you never, ever, surrender to the disease,' he says.

Support: Ms Strauss agrees to re-enter the stage when Dr Phil says to her: 'You do what it takes, and you never, ever, surrender to the disease'

After years of trying to save her daughter, Lisa, waiting on stage, tearfully hugs Ms Strauss.

'Jael’s dream was always to be a model,' Lisa explained.

Larry, who says his daughter had goals and dreams, until the drugs consumed her, added: 'She started doing a little bit of runway here and there, but it came to a halt due to behavioral problems.

'My worst fears have already been realized. She’s a dead girl walking and doesn’t know it.'

America's Next top Model: At 22, Ms Stauss was an aspiring model and a finalist in cycle eight of the Tyra Banks hosted show

Ms Strauss, who called herself 'well-rounded' while on the America's Next Top Model, has also had her fair share of struggles prior to Dr Phil's intervention.

A few episodes into the 2007 season, the model had to deal with a 
friend's death from an overdose.

While she decided to remain on the show, saying in an interview, 'There was never, never a question in my mind to leave 
the competition. My friend is gone and I am still here living life to 
the fullest,' she chose to dedicate her picture that week to her dead friend.

Then, that same year, she sued over the release of erotic photos taken of when she was 16.

Her
family adds that while experiencing her friend's overdose 'really shook
her', she herself could not keep away from drugs.

A habit they say has taken its toll both mentally and physically, including rotting her teeth and leaving her body covered in sores.

Ashamed: Jael Strauss found it a struggle to appear on the US show but told Dr Phil she was a 'well rounded person'

Devastated: Jael's behaviour has broken her family, including mother Debbie
