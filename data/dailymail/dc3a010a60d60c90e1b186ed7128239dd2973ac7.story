A father cradles his slumbering newborn son in a stylish black-and-white professional photo.

It's an image proud Al Ferguson, from Kent, and his partner, Jen, will no doubt treasure.

But a mere frame later, four-day-old baby Ted decided to really make his mark... by squirting out an impressive stream of poop across his dad's arm.

Al Ferguson, from Kent, decided to mark the arrival of his newborn son, Ted, with a charming photoshoot... which didn't go as planned

Mr Ferguson, 26, could only look on helplessly during the shoot with photographer Kirsty Grant.

Meanwhile, Ted's expression after relieving himself was one of pure contentment. 

‘It happened within a second,’ Mr Ferguson told Metro newspaper.

‘As I felt his stomach tense, in the back of your head you know he’s about to go poo, and then before you know it… he’s doing it.’

Without a care in the world, four-day-old Ted yawns - quite oblivious to his newfound fame

Mr Ferguson couldn't resist sharing the image and posted it on his blog The Dad Network, after which it went viral.  

And as for the rest of the shoot: an unfazed Ms Grant grabbed a nappy and applied it to the young chap's derriere.
