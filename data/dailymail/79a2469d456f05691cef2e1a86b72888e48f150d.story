Manchester United fans have claimed that they are being ripped off after first Yeovil Town and then Cambridge United hiked ticket prices for their FA Cup clashes with the Premier League giants.

Louis van Gaal's side will travel to the Abbey Stadium to face the League Two minnows in a fourth round clash on January 23 and away supporters have hit out after being charged £30.

Although that figure is considerably less than admission at most Premier League clubs furious United followers point out that fans of Luton, Cambridge's opponents in the third round, paid £19.

They are also seething about their own third round trip to Huish Park. Tickets there were also priced at £30 – double the £15 Accrington Stanley fans had been asked to pay in the Second Round.

One United fan, @fergusmufc, took to Twitter to vent his frustrations.

He tweeted: 'I see the magic of the cup means Cambridge can increase they're (sic) ticket prices by over 50% like Yeovil and no one says a word.'

'In the grand scheme of what we are charged week in week out £30 isn't the worse but it's the principal of the increase.'

Andrew Kilduff, from fans group Stretford End Flags, pointed out that the match would cause a transport nightmare for United supporters.

'We often hear the FA referring to the magic of the FA Cup,' he said.

'That magic is created not just by the teams competing but by the fans. Scheduling the game for a Friday night with such away travel issues is not good for travelling fans. To add insult to that, Cambridge have followed Yeovil and increased their admission prices for the tie by over 50%. 

'Once again profit comes before the fans. With these clubs trying to scrape every last penny from supporters. Cambridge stand to have a massive windfall from a full house and extra TV and commercial revenue, not to mention increased exposure.

'It's disappointing that once again fans will have to pay extra to experience this so-called cup magic.'

Earlier this month AFC Wimbledon refused to cash in on their dream FA Cup tie against Liverpool with a decision taken to fix ticket prices at League Two levels, between £4 and £25.

Cambridge United could not be reached for comment.

As at Yeovil, home supporters are also being charged extra, with adult main stand tickets priced at £18 for league matches, up to £35 for the United match, and tickets in other sections rising from £16 to £30.

United fans feel it is unfair that they should be charged more to attend, for being a Premier League club
