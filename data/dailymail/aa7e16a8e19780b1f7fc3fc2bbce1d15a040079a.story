Danny Cipriani is set to be left out of England’s squad for the four-match autumn Test series when it is announced next week.

Head coach Stuart Lancaster is expected to name Owen Farrell, George Ford and Stephen Myler as his three fly-halves as he prepares for the opening game against the All Blacks at Twickenham on November 8.

That means Cipriani, 26, will be in the Saxons squad along with Leicester’s Freddie Burns, unless one of Lancaster’s preferred trio gets injured.

Sale’s maverick stand-off came on as a replacement in two of England’s three summer Tests against New Zealand and must have hoped that he had done enough to keep his place in Lancaster’s set-up, particularly with next year’s World Cup in mind.

Cipriani has shone in patches this season, though the Sharks’ indifferent start in the Aviva Premiership has damaged his hopes.
