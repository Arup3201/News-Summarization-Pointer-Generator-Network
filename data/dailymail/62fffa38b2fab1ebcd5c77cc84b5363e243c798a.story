An Alabama mayor was arrested and a city police chief was taken to the hospital in an ambulance after a fight at city hall on Friday. 

Lipscomb police chief Warren Carey was trying to arrest Mayor Lance McDade when the fight broke out, according to a city clerk.

McDade is currently in jail for resisting arrest and assaulting a police officer, city officials said. 

Carey was later spotted 'hobbling' into his office with an injured leg before he was transported to the hospital, according to FOX6 News.

City hall was shut down for the rest of the day and crews were changing the locks on the building, FOX6 News reporter Melanie Posey tweeted. 

McDade was holding a letter when he was arrested that read: 'Dear City of Liscomb employees, this letter is to inform you that all city employees are on administrative leave with pay until further notice. With exceptions for city dispatch.' 

McDade will be held in prison over the weekend.

City clerk Connie Madsen said the mayor pro term, Brenda Renz, is now in charge of the city. 

Madsen told AL.com the investigation into the incident is ongoing and no formal charges have been filed against McDade yet.  

The city clerk said all of the employees were still working and no one has been put on leave. 

She said McDade has made it 'difficult' for the employees 'to function and do our jobs'. 

This is not the first time McDade, who was elected in November 2012, has gotten into trouble with the law.  

Both McDade and his wife were arrested and charged with domestic violence and harassment after police were called to their home last year and found they both had minor injuries. 

The couple had been arguing about how they were going to divide their property during their pending divorce, according to AL.com.

Just two months following his arrest, McDade was found guilty of attempting to elude a police officer during a traffic violation. 

McDade fled from the officer first in his car and then on foot while trying to avoid arrest, according to the officer's statement in court documents. 

The mayor was also arrested in 2013, when he showed up to the scene of a fire and tried to force a volunteer fire department lieutenant to leave because he had recently dismissed her. 

McDade was arrested for obstructing governmental process after he allegedly refused to leave, even after a police officer told him she had authorized the lieutenant to be there, according to AL.com. 

And two years ago McDade temporarily shut down the entire city police department and laid off city employees because he said the city was having financial problems.
