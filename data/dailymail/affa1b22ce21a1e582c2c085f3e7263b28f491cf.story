John Terry has shown England just what they were missing as the former Three Lions captain throws punches and kicks in a personal training session.

It was, perhaps, the style of defence that England could have done with as Uruguay and Liverpool striker Luis Suarez almost single-handedly left Roy Hodgson's World Cup in tatters.

Terry has had no competitive football to prepare for, having retired from the national team in 2012, but looks to be keeping himself in shape ahead of Chelsea's next Premier League campaign.

Kicking out: Terry retired from international football in 2012 but is keeping himself fit for pre-season

Terry, who retired before a contentious trial for alleged racial abuse of former QPR player Anton Ferdinand, has taken to the social media platform with time on his hands over the summer.

Along with the video, Terry wrote: 'Gym session done #algarve #gettingreadyforpreseason'

Terry's displays at Chelsea warranted calls from the media for him to return for the tournament in Brazil, but the defender had already decided 78 caps were enough.

Instead, Hodgson took Terry's Chelsea team-mate Gary Cahill, Everton's Phil Jagielka and Manchester United duo Phil Jones and Chris Smalling to act as his four central defenders.

England now go to their final game against Costa Rica in the hope of pulling off the seemingly impossible in Group D.

They need Italy to beat Uruguay, and need to claim their first win of the World Cup themselves.
