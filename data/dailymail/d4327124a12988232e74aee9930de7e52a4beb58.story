Dirk Kuyt was so desperate to carry on playing against Brazil he got Holland's medical team to staple a head wound shut while still on the pitch.

While some have questioned the value of the World Cup third-place play-off match, it clearly meant a lot to Kuyt, as he received gruesome treatment after clashing with Brazil defender Maxwell.

The former Liverpool player went crashing to the deck late in the first half after an aerial duel with Maxwell, and insisted he continue playing after the medical team had checked he was okay.

Holland took a two-goal lead in the first half against Luiz Felipe Scolari's side, thanks to an early penalty from Robin van Persie and a well-taken finish by Daley Blind.
