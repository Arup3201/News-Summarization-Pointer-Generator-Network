Ben Needham was just 21-months-old when he vanished 
from the Greek island of Kos on July 24, 1991, while he was with his family.

The mystery surrounding Ben’s fate made 
headlines for almost a decade, with scores of false sightings, ill-fated
DNA tests and stalled re-investigations, with his mother Kerry fighting
against the odds as the years passed by.

Ben's grandmother Christine was in charge of the toddler on the day that he went missing, having moved to the island with her husband and sons to start a new life away from Sheffield. Now she has opened her heart about the guilt she carries in a letter to Ben, who will be 24 on his next birthday.

In the open letter, printed in Yours 
magazine on Tuesday Christine said: 'We were thrilled when you and your 
mum followed us to Kos. Every day was like a holiday. But not for long.

'The incredible guilt of being the 
one looking after you when you disappeared – while your mum was working 
in a local hotel – will live with me forever. I’ve learned to cope with 
it because in my heart of hearts, I know I wasn’t negligent. Constantly 
checking, one moment you were there playing in the sandy soil; the next 
you’d gone.

'Your mum’s never blamed me. That 
would have destroyed me. Seeing I blamed myself enough, she’s never once
screamed: ‘It’s your fault.’ Even on that day I arrived at her work and
collapsed hysterically to tell her ‘I’ve lost Ben.’

Theories about Ben's disappearance 
have included that Ben was killed, abducted by gypsies or sold to a 
family who could not have a child.

Ben's mother Kerry, 41, has recently written a book about the tragedy. She hopes that the searingly honest account of how she 
has coped with losing Ben could prompt somebody to come forward and that it will mark the start of a 
new phase in their lives.

In the book, Ben by Kerry Needham, Kerry admits she found oblivion in drink and nightclubs to ease her
pain – so much so that her young daughter Leighanna, who wasn't born when Ben went missing, was sent to live with her 
grandparents.

Christine describes her relationship with her daughter and granddaughter in the letter: 'Eventually Kerry broke down. Once she overdosed when pregnant with the beautiful sister you’ve never met, Leighanna, now 19.

'Looking so like you, Kerry couldn’t cope when she was the age you disappeared and she left her with me. It was her wayward phase and the only time we rowed. Thankfully it didn’t last. Despite all, we have a stronger relationship than ever.

'We’re always there for each other and for Leighanna, who’s spoilt rotten as you’d be. Without each other, we couldn’t carry on. My whole life’s spent making sure Kerry’s OK. When the light goes out of her eyes, I step in.'

Kerry sold her garden fencing company three months ago and moved to Turkey to live with her brother Danny.

In a recent interview Leighanna, who lives in Sheffield said: ‘We’re still 
waiting for the happy ending, But the book has been 
cathartic for Mum. It’s her story, something she’s wanted to do since 
five years after Ben went missing.'

Christine finishes her letter by saying: 'I’ll never give up hope. Never. Somebody, somewhere knows what happened. We’ve all missed out; you too Ben. Your whole personality; your DNA is here in our quirky little family who would have spoilt you so much. With pure love, Nanny.'

Continued hunt: 18 officers from South Yorkshire Police went to the island of Kos to continue the search for Ben last autumn

A series of false leads have given the Needhams hope in the years since he went missing.

In 1998, a tourist saw a blond boy of ten on a beach in Rhodes, but a DNA test proved he was not Ben.

In
December 2012, Kerry Needham was contacted by a Greek woman who gave 
her a photo she claimed was of Ben aged five or six, but it failed to 
lead to a breakthrough.

Over the years police released a series of computer images showing how Ben might look as he was growing up.
