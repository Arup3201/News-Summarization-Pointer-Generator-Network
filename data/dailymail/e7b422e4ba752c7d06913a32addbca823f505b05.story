A dull grey line drawing, unearthed in the US Patent Office, could be the blueprint for the cheap iPhone that Apple has always denied it's going to make.

Patent Number 8,364,032 was filed by Apple with the US Patent Office in February last year, and granted late last month.

The patent covers a device with a front-facing screen, a rear-facing camera and a plastic body - with no iconic home button.

Groundbreaking: Patent Number 8,364,032 doesn't look like much, but it could herald Apple's entry to the low-cost market in China

Flagship: Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice-president of worldwide marketing, launched the now iconic iPhone 5 in San Francisco last autumn

Queueing: Eager customers wait to get in to a newly opened Apple store in Beijing - but analysts say Apple is missing the boat in the important Chinese market

But don't hold your breath if you'd like to snap up this phone: if this is indeed the cheap iPhone that has been rumoured, it is likely to be for the customers in emerging markets such as China and India.

The flagship iPhone 5 was launched amid much fanfare at the end of last year.

But the iPhone 5's maps were a disaster. Apple had dropped Google's polished and more Maps app in favour of its own.

And the problems quickly emerged, with the new maps directing drivers on to airport runways, missing churches in Milan, and even a missing bay in Ukraine.

Chief executive Tim Cook apologised, saying: 'We strive to make world-class products that deliver the best experience possible to our customers. With the launch of our new Maps last week, we fell short on this commitment.

Scott Forstall, the executive in charge of Maps, was quickly fired.

Apple has in the past concentrated on making expensive hardware for high-value customers, making the bulk of its profits from selling hardware.

But analysts have said that the Californian firm should make a cheaper smartphone to gain more of a foothold in the important Chinese market.

Apple's grip on the smartphone market has weakened - researchers IDC said that in the third quarter of 2012, it had accounted for only 14.6 per cent of worldwide smartphone shipments, down from 23 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012.

Rumours about a cheaper version of the iPhone have been circulating for some time, and what we know from the patent application seems to fit: the plastic body mentioned in the patent would keep costs down.

The cheaper version could be powered by the lower-cost Qualcomm Snapdragon processor, and wouldn't have the very high-quality 'Retina' screen.

A cheap iPhone for emerging markets would be a departure from the Californian giant's previous strategy.

However, Phil Schiller, senior vice-president of marketing, told the Shanghai Evening News: 'Every product that Apple creates, we consider using only the best technology available.

'Despite the popularity of cheap smartphones, this will never be the future of Apple's products.

But Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, told the Chinese state-run Xinhua News last month: 'China is currently our second largest market. I believe it will become our first. I believe strongly that it will.'
