Three climbers have been airlifted to hospital after being caught up in an avalanche and swept 450ft down the side of a Scottish mountain.

The three men had been climbing in the Coire an t-Sneachda area of the Cairngorms when the avalanche struck shortly before 11.30am.

Police who arrived at the scene first were assisted by members of Cairngorm Mountain Rescue Team, an RAF
helicopter and a Strathclyde Police mountain rescue team, who were 
training in the area.

The avalanche rescue in Cairngorms in Scotland saved three men who were caught in an avalanche in the Scottish mountains yesterday

The climbers were taken to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness. Rescue teams said they only escaped life-threatening injuries because they were all wearing safety helmets one of which was left with a large gash down the side.

One of the men suffered two broken ankles in the avalanche.

Training officer Al Gilmour said: 'Strathclyde Police Mountain Rescue
are training in the area so they were on the hill and we also had 
Killin Mountain Rescue and Cairngorm Ski Patrol on the scene really 
quickly and that was followed by a rescue helicopter.

'There was actually a separate 
avalanche in the area before we got the call out for the later one with 
three people. Two people involved in that walked away completely unscathed so they were lucky.

'The later one involved three men who 
were carried about 150m over rocks but they were wearing helmets and, 
from accounts of the rescue personnel on the hill, that probably saved 
them and they got away with leg injuries, although one of them may have a
particularly serious lower leg injury.

'I saw one of the helmets of one of 
the guys who was rescued and it's got quite deep scratches along the 
side. It was only the three men involved and at no point were they under
the snow they were pushed along on the surface.'

A spokesman for the RAF, who sent a 
rescue helicopter from Lossiemouth, said clear weather allowed the Sea 
King aircraft to reach the area safely.

He said: 'The crew has been called to
this point many times and know it intimately. The weather was 
exceptionally clear and posed no problem for access to the casualties.

'The only consideration was moderate 
turbulence which required the aircrew to apply full margin of power. The
three casualties were taken to hospital; two were walking wounded, the 
third had unfortunately broken both ankles.

'On board the Sea King was also an 
A&E doctor taking part in scheduled familiarisation flying who was 
able to administer pain-killing relief to the casualty.'

Recent weather in the Cairngorms had raised the avalanche risk to 'considerable'.

Meanwhile, a 57-year-old man was also rescued by helicopter after falling on Ben Lui in the southern Highlands.

The hill walker managed to contact 
Central Scotland Police at around 4.20pm and a Royal Navy rescue 
helicopter from Prestwick was sent to the scene.

Police said the RAF Leuchars Mountain
Rescue team were training in the area and helped locate the man who was
taken to the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow with head and leg 
injuries.

The incidents happened just two weeks after an alvalanche claimed the lives of four people in the Highlands.

Hospital doctor Rachel Majumdar, 29; 
PhD student Tom Chesters, 28; Christopher Bell, 24, also a PhD student; 
and 25-year-old junior doctor Una Finnegan died after they were caught 
up in an avalanche in Glencoe on Saturday January 19.

Mr Gilmour added: 'Recently we've had a
lot of wind and there's been a fair bit of fresh snow so there's been a
bit blowing around.

'The avalanche information service forecast a 
considerable risk of avalanche above 900m, pretty much from east through
to south west facing slopes and both of the avalanches today happened 
around east facing areas at altitude.'
