PC Adam Rushton is accused of having sex with vulnerable women while he was on duty and asking one of them to send him 'some filth' by text 

A police officer who had sex with women while he was on duty asked one of them to 'send some filth' in a text message, a court heard.

Staffordshire Police officer Adam Rushton is accused of having sex with four women while he was on duty, including one dalliance at a police station where a woman is said to have put handcuffs on him. 

One of the women who Rushton is accused of seducing said they had sex around five times and he also asked her to send dirty pictures in a text messages.

He first met the woman, then 21, after she reported a burglary in July 2006, Birmingham Crown Court heard.

Giving evidence from behind a screen, the woman said she kept in touch with Rushton after the incident - informing him of her new address every time she moved as well as her contact details.  

She said she kept in touch with him in case she needed anything or to be protected.

In November 2011, Rushton sent the woman a text, which read: 'Still waiting, send some filth'.

She told the jury: 'By 2011, I had known Adam for quite a while. Contact could go on for a month and then he would not hear from me for a while.

'He may have asked for pictures from me, some intimate pictures maybe but I replied telling him "no, I am not sending naughty pics to your work phone."'

The woman described Rushton as a 'nice police officer' and said on one occasion they had sex after he turned up in his police uniform.

She added: 'Adam was the only person to give a damn. If I had said "Adam, no I am not going to send anything," he would have stopped. There was no pressure.

'I think at the time I used Adam but only when I needed somebody.

'There might have been other texts but I cannot remember. 

'We never met anywhere sordid. We had sex four or five times. He was wearing his uniform on one occasion when he came round so I presume he must have driven in his police car.' 

Rushton denies ten counts of misconduct in public office and two counts of obtaining personal data without permission.

The officer was suspended after the allegations came to light in 2013. 

Prosecutors have accused him of using his position to engineer relationships with seven  women during a six year spell from 2006.

Rushton has been accused of sending  a woman explicit selfies of himself while wearing his uniform, as well as picking another woman up in a patrol car before taking her back to Longton Police station in Stoke-on-Trent where they had sex in an office.

Prosecutor Duncan Bould said: 'He picked her up in a marked car, in uniform, and she had to wait in the car while he checked the coast was clear.' 

Mr Bould said the only purpose for taking the woman into the station was 'sexual activity,' 

But he said as she put his handcuffs on him and things started to go further they were disturbed and had to leave.  

On another occasion, the court heard Rushton persuaded a woman to show him her private parts after he turned up at her home.

Rushton is accused of committing a 'serious breach of trust' by having sex with the women while on duty as a police officer. 

The trial continues.
