Santi Cazorla is confident Alexis Sanchez can fire Arsenal to the Premier League title.

The Chile forward completed his £30million move from Barcelona on Thursday, signing a four-year deal with the Gunners.

And Cazorla, who helped Arsenal win the FA Cup last season, believes his new team-mate will prove the difference this season.

Star: Santi Cazorla believes the signing of Alexis Sanchez will boost Arsenal's Premier League chances

‘It is a very important signing,’ said Cazorla, at the launch of Arsenal’s new PUMA kit. ‘He's a world-class player - I've said it before. Having him at Arsenal night make a big difference just because of the player he is.

‘If you bring in players of an outstanding level, it will lift the team to an outstanding level.

‘The more quality players you have in your squad the more you can fight and we were unlucky with injuries last year.

‘Having another fast player in the squad like Alexis will also give us extra opportunities going forward next year.’ When asked if Arsenal could win the league, the 29-year-old said: ‘Absolutely. Absolutely. If we have an even better squad than last year then why can’t we be champions this year?’

Mikel Arteta joined Cazorla for the kit launch at Puma’s flagship store in Carnaby Street, London, and both praised the World Cup performances of Arsenal striker Joel Campbell.

The 22-year-old forward played in all five of Costa Rica’s World Cup matches, and is set to return to north London for pre-season training with the Gunners having spent the last three seasons on loan at Lorient, Real Betis and Olympiacos.

‘I think he has reached a level where he is ready to play for Arsenal,’ said Cazorla, who played against the Costa Rican in La Liga before his move to the Emirates.  

‘I’ve known Campbell for many years now because of his time in Spain. I know him a lot and I think every day he is developing and becoming a better player.’

Cazorla said he was happy that Arsenal had signed a kit deal with Puma, having represented the label for the last year. He was wearing PUMAs when he scored Arsenal’s first goal in the 3-2 FA Cup final win in May.

‘Absolutely, I'm really proud of my goal in that match so I’m happy Arsenal are with Puma now.

‘I've been a Puma player for one year now and the boots have really helped me and my game. They have really made a difference.

‘We are happy to have such a beautiful match between Puma and the club.’
