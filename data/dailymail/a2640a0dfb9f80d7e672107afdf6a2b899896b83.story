Germany made a half-time pledge not to humiliate Brazil in their astonishing semi-final clash on Tuesday night.

Joachim Low’s side led 5-0 after the first 45 minutes in Belo Horizonte before completing a 7-1 rout to reach Sunday’s final.

But defender Mats Hummels said they were determined to be professional after the break.

'We just made it clear that we had to stay focused and not try to humiliate them,' he said.

‘We said we had to stay serious and concentrate at half-time. That’s something you don’t have to show on the pitch if you are playing.

‘You have to show the opponent respect and it was very important that we did this and didn’t try to show some magic or something like this. It was important we played our game for 90 minutes.’

Hummels, who hopes to recover from injury in time for Sunday’s final, believes Germany will have to deliver a repeat performance in Rio de Janeiro.

‘After our second goal they got confused. They were not organised on the pitch and after that we didn’t miss a chance until we scored the fifth goal. This doesn’t happen too often. You just have to enjoy it,’ he added.

‘We must keep our feet on the ground, but that’s no problem for us. We know how hard it will be on Sunday. It doesn’t matter who the opponent is on the day. It will be a hard fight and the only chance we have of winning is if we know that from the start.

‘We know we are one of the best teams in the world but you always need a bit of luck and for us it was a good day. We must enjoy what happened, but if we lose the final, this semi-final will not be worth anything.

‘The game does not have any impact on the final on because it will be a totally different game. It was nice how it went, but it will be no problem keeping our feet on the ground.’
