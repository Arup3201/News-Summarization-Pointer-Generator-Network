Fabian Delph, who impressed on his England debut on Monday, is set to be offered an improved contract by Aston Villa.

The 24-year-old midfielder has a year left on his current so is free to talk to clubs in January - and leave for nothing next summer - but Tom Fox, Villa’s new chief executive, is putting together a package to keep him. 

Manager Paul Lambert is confident an agreement can be reached, despite owner Randy Lerner wanting to reduce the wage bill.

Hands off: Aston Villa want the 24-year-old midfielder to put pen to paper on a new deal with the club

Stretch: Manager Paul Lambert is confident an agreement can be reached despite the constrained wage bill

Delph, signed from Leeds for £6million in 2009, is believed to be one of Villa’s highest earners on about £40,000 per week.

Negotiating a long-term deal for him will be Fox’s first big test since arriving from Arsenal. The contracts of Darren Bent (£60,000 a week) and Alan Hutton (£40,000) also expire in the summer. If they leave it would free up substantial cash.

Delph has said he wants to see out his career at Villa Park to repay the faith shown in him by the club after he suffered two serious injuries in his first two seasons.

Meanwhile, Villa have offered Chelsea target Jack Grealish, 19, a new four-year deal.
