She is a distinguished actress, known for her roles in Shakespearean and classical drama and has been vocal in her opposition to racism.

But Janet Suzman risked angering her peers and audiences when she said theatre was intrinsically part of white culture and black people were not interested.

The actress, who has recently appeared with African actor Khayalethu Anthony in Solomon and Marion, said non-white people rarely go to see plays because, she believes 'they're not interested. It's not in their culture.' 

Actress Janet Suzman has angered her contemporaries after she said theatre was a 'white invention' and black people were not interested in watching plays because it is not an intrinsic part of their culture. She is pictured in an appearance in Solomon and Marion with actor Khayalethu Anthony earlier this year 

She told The Guardian: 'Theatre is a white invention, a European invention, and white people go to it. It's in their DNA. It starts with Shakespeare.' 

She was responding to comments from actress Meera Syal who recently called for theatres to do more to cater for Asian audiences. 

Syal criticised her statements and told the newspaper the argument was about appealing to people from diverse backgrounds, not trying to claim theatre was the invention of a single culture.

Others dismissed Suzman's words as incorrect, while one director said the actresses words implied she should just give up now.

Suzman, 71, was born in South Africa and has worked there as a director. The actress has also supported the work of her aunt Helen Suzman, an anti apartheid campaigner.

She enjoyed an early successful career at the Royal Shakespeare Company, starting as Joan of Arc in The Wars of the Roses. She has also performed in classical productions and directed in her native South Africa. 

Janet Suzman said black audiences did not come to see her performance in Solomon and Anthony with  actor Khayalethu Anthony and said it was up to writers to get different audiences interested in theatre

However Suzman, who is the is the ex-wife of former Royal Shakespeare Company director Sir Trevor Nunn, said that there was still not enough interest in theatre from black culture, and it was up to writers to get more people from different backgrounds interested in watching plays. 

The actress, who was made a dame in 2011, said she had recently performed in Solomon and Marion, a South African play, with Khayalethu Anthony. The actor is from Cape Town and is known for his role in Mandela: A Long Walk to Freedom.

But she said she was concerned as black people did not come to see the play, and reported seeing just one black person in the audience at The Print Room in London. 

She added: 'And they don't bloody come. 

'They're not interested. It's not in their culture, that's why. Just as their stuff is not in white culture.'

Janet Suzman was born in South Africa in 1939. 

Her grandfather, Max Sonnenberg, was a member of South African Parliament while her aunt was an anti-apartheid campaigner. 

Dame Janet Suzman is a renowned actress, known for her Shakespearean roles in the 1960s 

Suzman enjoyed early success with the Royal Shakespeare Company - appearing in The War of the Roses and playing heroines in a number of key works including Titus Andronicus and The Merchant of Venice. 

She has also appeared in classical plays such as Hedda Gabbler and Chekhov's The Three Sisters. 

In the 1960s and 1970s she appeared in British television drama before her first film role in Nicholas and Alexandra in 1971. 

Suzman appeared in a few films in the 1980s, including A Dry White Season with Marlon Brando in 1983. 

The actress also turned director in her later life, directing Othello back in her native South Africa.

Most recently she performed in Solomon and Marion at the Print Theatre earlier this year.  

She married director Sir Trevor Nunn in 1969 and the couple, who have a son, divorced 20 years later. 

Suzman is a patron for charity Dignity in Dying.

The actress was named in the Queen's Honours List in 2011 and made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire for her services to the acting profession. 

She has honorary degrees from a number of universities including Cape Town, Leicester and London.  

Meera Syal, the actress, has called for theatres to stop ignoring Asians and put on more diverse performances.

She said she had never heard 'a single race or culture claim theatre was their invention before.'

She said the most important thing was not about where theatre came from, but about how we can make productions more relevant for a variety of audiences. 

Nadia Latif, a theatre director from Sudan, branded the actress 'a hideous woman' in light of her comments. 

Ms Latif, who has about 10 years experience working as a freelance director, said she felt it was simply not true that black people and those from ethnic minorities were not interested in going to the theatre. 

Meera Syal called for more theatre for Asian people

She said: 'I'm a theatre director and these comments hit me to the core of who I am.'

Ms Latif said she did not think it was true and said she herself was a young black member of theatre audiences 20 years ago. She said she did not believe people did not go to the theatre because of their cultural background but more because they are 'frequently priced out of it.' 

She acknowledged more needed to be done but said there should be a focus on how many successful black actors and directors there already were, as well as people interested in theatre. 

The director said there was a 'real problem when people try to make something about monoculture' and instead it was about making something diverse and appealing to all. 

She added: 'Also you have to remember that a theatre in Notting Hill isn't representative of the nation's theatre-going.'  

A spokeswoman for the National Theatre said they were doing their best to appeal to audiences from diverse ethnic backgrounds, but admitted there was still more to be done. 

She said: 'We want to present a diverse and popular repertoire which can reach the widest possible audience and represent the widest range of voices. 

The emergence of artists and voices who reflect the full diversity of the nation and the capital on our stages is key to this; much remains to be done but we hope that recent and current productions such as The Amen Corner and Moon on a Rainbow Shawl.'
