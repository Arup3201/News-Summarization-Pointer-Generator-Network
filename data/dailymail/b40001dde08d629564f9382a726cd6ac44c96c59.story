A bloody, hours-long fight in a prison in the Mexican border city of Matamoros has left at least 20 inmates dead and 12 injured.

The fight started yesterday morning with a dispute between two inmates and other prisoners joined in, creating a melee that lasted until authorities retook control of the facility.

Officials are now notifying families of those killed and injured, according to a statement from the state public security department in Tamaulipas, where Matamoros is located.

Alleged members of a Mexican drug cartel are lined up alongside seized guns and drugs in Matamoros last week. An hours-long fight in the border city's prison left 20 inmates dead yesterday

An investigation into the incident has been launched.

The violence lasted from about 8am to 10.30am on Saturday morning before soldiers and marines took control, according to a state official who was not authorised to comment.

The violence comes as Mexican prison conditions have been under increased scrutiny because of violence and escapes.

On Thursday, a fight between gang 
members at a prison outside Monterrey left seven inmates dead. In July, a
riot in a prison in the border city of Juarez killed 17 inmates.

Gangs and drug cartels often dispute for control of prisons in Mexico, which also suffer a high level of corruption.

Matamoros sits across the border from Brownsville, Texas.

Last year, the drug-related death toll in Mexico stood at 15,273 after skyrocketing a massive 60 per cent on the previous year.

In the four years since Mexican president Felipe Calderon’s first wave of 6,500 troops went into battle with the cartels, more than 35,000 people have died.

The violence was so intense in the country in 2008 that the Pentagon warned Mexico was on the verge of becoming a failed state.

A bolster of more troops – some 50,000 are now fighting the war on drugs – has done little to reduce the death toll.

And despite U.S. funding trade in marijuana, ecstasy and methamphetamine grew last year, a National Drug Threat Assessment report said earlier this year.

The wholesale value of drug sales ranges from $13.6billion to a staggering $48.4billion annually, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.
