Brian Harvey vented his anger at the music industry as he smashed up a platinum disc

Former East 17 frontman Brian Harvey vented his anger at the music industry as he smashed up platinum discs he was awarded with the band and then posted a bizarre video of his outburst online.

In the expletive-packed burst of anger, he rants: 'East 17, one million sales - this is what it f****** means,' before the destruction begins.

The 41-year-old then whacks the framed discs against a metal junction box in an alley, shattering the glass and then dumping the wreckage on the paving slabs.

He concludes the outburst: 'That's what I think of your f****** music industry.' 

Then, in a later film posted on his YouTube channel, he is seen in the alley once more tidying up and placing the debris in a bin.

In the follow-up, he returns to tidy up and says: 'I'm a peaceful person, and I pick my rubbish up.'

East 17 sold 18 million records during their career.

Harvey was left with severe injuries in 2005 following a bizarre accident in which he ran over himself, attributing it to overeating and then falling out of his car while vomiting.

The online video comes just a week after the former pop star met Simon Danczuk, Labour MP for Rochdale, to pass on information he had obtained during his own investigation into historic child abuse.  

In October, 40-year-old Harvey was turned away from Downing Street after he arrived demanding to see the Prime Minister. 

A witness said he was shouting: 'You'll all be dancing to my number one single at Christmas'.'

Former plumber Harvey joined songwriter Tony Mortimer and rappers Terry Coldwell and John Hendy to form East 17 in 1991.

They had 15 hit singles, including Deep, It's Alright and 1994 chart-topper Stay Another Day, from three studio albums.

Harvey was famously thrown out of East 17 in 1997 after telling a radio interviewer of the merits of ecstasy.

Harvey then dumped the wreckage of the platinum disc on the paving slabs. He concludes the outburts: 'That's what I think of your f****** music industry.'

After the destructive outburst, pictured above, Harvey returned to the alleyway to clear-up telling fans 'I'm a peaceful person, and I pick my rubbish up.'

He boasted of having taken up to 12 ecstasy tablets in one night and having driven after taking the drug. East 17 later reinstated him, but Tony Mortimer subsequently quit.

Harvey appeared on ITV's I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here in 2004, but walked out of the show after a row with Janet Street Porter.
