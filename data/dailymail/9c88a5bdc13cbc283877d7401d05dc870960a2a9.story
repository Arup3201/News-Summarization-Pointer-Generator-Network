Cyprus has become the fifth eurozone country to apply to Brussels for an emergency bailout.

The tiny Mediterranean country is applying for funds for both for its banking sector, which has been hit by exposure to Greece and for its budget deficit.

The announcement means Cyprus would 
follow Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain into the arms of the 
emergency rescue funds set up for the 17-member euro currency zone.

Crisis: Cyprus has become the fifth eurozone country to apply to Brussels for a bailout

It has just four days left to raise at 
least 1.8 billion euros - equivalent to about 10 per cent of its 
domestic output - to satisfy European regulators about the health of 
Cyprus Popular Bank, its second largest lender which saw its balance 
sheet hurt by bad Greek debt.

Finance Minister Vassos Shiarly said the
country would also seek enough money to help with its budget deficit. 
The full amount would be decided over the course of weeks.

'The amount will be as much as it may be needed to cover the recapitalisation and fiscal requirements,' he told Reuters. 'These will be established after careful review during the next few weeks.'

With its coffers emptying rapidly and hurtling towards an immovable deadline, the island suffered a further sovereign credit rating cut on Monday by Fitch, to the non-investment, or junk, BB+ grade.

Cyprus has already been shut out from
raising new funds on capital markets, with yields on its existing bonds
well into double digits.

Cypriot President Demetris Christofias, The EU's only Communist leader, has been reluctant to accept the fiscal and regulatory conditions that might be attached to a European rescue

Cypriot officials said the bailout request did not specify how much they need from their EU partners.

An
island with just 1 million residents, Cyprus has a disproportionately 
large financial sector that is heavily exposed to Greece, a neighbour 
more than 10 times the size with which it shares a language, culture and
close political links.

A 
government statement said: 'The purpose of the required assistance is to
contain the risks to the Cypriot economy, notably those arising from 
the negative spill over effects through its financial sector, due to its
large exposure in the Greek economy.'

With a bailout widely viewed as all 
but inevitable, Cyprus has for weeks been trying to juggle its options 
between a bailout from Europe's rescue funds - the temporary EFSF and 
the permanent ESM - or a bilateral loan from either Russia or China.

Cypriot
President Demetris Christofias was scheduled to brief political leaders
on Tuesday afternoon, a statement from the presidency said.

The
EU's only Communist leader, Christofias has been reluctant to accept 
the fiscal and regulatory conditions that might be attached to a 
European rescue.

As late as
this weekend, trips by government officials to China suggested Cyprus 
was still holding out hope for a bilateral loan from a third country.

On Friday night Christofias spoke of 'trying to avoid' the mechanism.Commerce,
Industry and Tourism Minister Neoklis Sylikiotis was dispatched to 
China, where talks were focused on a loan or a Chinese investment in the
troubled Cyprus Popular Bank.

'We have had some contacts... We have
requested an answer in coming days,' Sylikiotis said in comments to the
state broadcaster hours before the government said it would be applying
to the EU.

Moscow already 
provided Cyprus with 2.5 billion euros in a bilateral loan last year and
has an interest in maintaining Cyprus as an offshore financial centre 
with low tax rates for Russian businessmen, who use it as a base to 
reinvest in Russia.

However, seeking such large sums from
Moscow or Beijing is controversial in Cyprus, where EU membership is a 
matter of national pride.

It could be embarrassing for Brussels as well, as Cyprus assumes the bloc's rotating presidency on July 1.

Cyprus
is fiercely protective of a corporate tax rate that is one of the 
lowest in the EU, and eight months before a general election shows no 
appetite for the stringent spending cuts likely to be demanded in return
for EU funding.

Christofias has repeatedly said any economic measures would not further impact 'the workers'.

The European Commission has 
repeatedly urged Cyprus to take measures to cut its deficit below 3.0 
percent and increase the competitiveness of the economy.

The
government says it is in the process of implementing such steps and 
targets a deficit of about 2.5 percent of GDP this year.

'The main source of concern is the bank recapitalisation, but given that the European Commission is coming out quite strongly about excessive imbalances in the Cypriot economy one would expect them to look at that too,' said Michalis Florentiades, head of economic research at Hellenic Bank.

Cyprus Popular needs a capital infusion urgently to satisfy regulators after writing off the value of Greek government bonds in a sovereign debt swap earlier this year.

In its report, Fitch said the recapitalisation bill for Cypriot banks could potentially reach 4 billion euros.

That amount, equivalent to 23 percent of GDP, would also take into account rising non-performing loans from the domestic market.
