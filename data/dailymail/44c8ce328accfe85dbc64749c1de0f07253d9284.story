Andy Murray began his preparations for his Australian Open semi-final against Tomas Berdych as the British No 1 practised at Melbourne Park on Wednesday.

Murray returned to the Margaret Court Arena, the scene of his first two victories of the tournament this year, to hit for around an hour as coach Amelie Mauresmo watched on.

Australian 22-year-old Benjamin Mitchell, the world No 238, was Murray's practice partner for a session which predominantly consisted of serving and returning.

Murray has been in fine form so far in Melbourne and ended the hopes of Aussie teenager Nick Kyrgios on Tuesday night with a solid 6-3, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3 victory.

And now Murray takes on Berdych in what should be a fascinating encounter on the Rod Laver Arena on Thursday at 8:30am UK time, with the Brit's former assistant coach Dani Vallverdu now in the Czech's corner.

It is the first time Vallverdu has had to prepare a game plan to beat Murray since the split during the off-season.

'I don't know,' said Murray when asked how he will feel with Vallverdu in the opposite corner.

'Maybe I'll find it weird on the day. But it's just something that you deal with as a player. My goal isn't to beat Dani, my goal is to beat Berdych.

'We'll see how the match plays out and what the tactics are and stuff. But I also know what Dani thinks of Berdych's game because he's told me, so it works both ways.

'He's a big guy. He strikes the ball very well. He serves well. He's fairly calm on the court. I think he manages emotions fairly well.

'And he's obviously played extremely well this tournament so far. Just by looking at the results, he's had some good wins and played well in Doha. He'll be coming into the match with confidence.'
