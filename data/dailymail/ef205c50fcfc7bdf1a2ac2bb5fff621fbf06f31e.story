Government officials have vehemently denied claims that Hillary Clinton is undergoing extensive tests for brain cancer.

The National Enquirer reported the debilitating illness was behind the Secretary of State's recent collapse and that she was facing a barrage of medical tests to confirm the diagnosis.

But a spokesman for the 65-year-old Democrat labelled the claims 'absolute nonsense' and insisted Clinton was recovering well from the fall and subsequent concussion.

'The story... is absolute nonsense. The Secretary continues to recuperate at home,' the spokesman told MailOnline.

The State Department said the fall was caused by a debilitating stomach virus Clinton contracted during a diplomatic trip to Europe.

But the Enquirer claims in its 'World Exclusive Cover Story' that brain cancer was the real reason behind the collapse, and also behind Clinton's decision to step down as Secretary of State.

'Behind the scenes, Hillary has suffered blinding headaches, problems with her memory, plus terrifying blackouts - and those closest to her say she's hiding a brain cancer secret,' the Enquirer quotes an unnamed source as saying.

'This has been covered up for months,
 but details of Hillary's cancer situation are beginning to leak out, 
and it's the real reason she's giving up her position as secretary of 
state.'

The
 newspaper said a family insider confirmed Clinton was going through a 
series of 'top secret' tests that would diagnose brain cancer.

'While
 government officials are blaming her problems on a stomach virus, 
they're covering up the real story,' the insider was quoted as saying.

'Everyone's worst nightmare is that she has a brain tumor or, worse yet, incurable brain cancer.'

Successor: President Obama, left, nominated Democratic Senator from Massachusetts John Kerry, right, to replace Clinton

On Friday, President Barack Obama nominated Senator John Kerry to replace Clinton as Secretary of State, after she chose to step down from the high pressure position.

The departure was not a surprise.

For the past year, she has made her 
intentions to leave the position if Obama won a second term clear and 
has been saying goodbye to her colleagues in outposts around the world.

'It's important for me to step off this incredibly high wire I've been on to take stock of the rest of my life,' she explained after casting her ballot in November's election.

Some still believe Clinton will run for president in 2016 but she recently told ABC's Barbara Walters she was looking forward to her life after politics.

'Maybe (I'll) do some reading and writing and speaking and teaching,' she said. Clinton also assured Walters during the interview that she was 'healthy.'
