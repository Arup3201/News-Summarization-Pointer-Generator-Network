The Royal Mint has revealed a new £20 collector's coin featuring wartime prime minister Sir Winston Churchill to commemorate the 50 years since his death.

Arguably Britain's most famous Prime Minister, Sir Winston is the only statesman to have ever been honoured on three official  coins.

Ahead of the collector's item going on sale, Sir Winston's great grandson Randolph Churchill, along with his seven-year-old son John, today visited The Royal Mint in Llantrisant, south Wales, to see the new solid silver coins.

The newest of these is the third in the The Royal Mint's £20 for £20 coin range.  

Mr Churchill said: 'This year marks 50 years since the death of my great grandfather and 75 years since his finest hour, on becoming wartime Prime Minister.

'It is fantastic to see so many and such varied activities taking place to celebrate everything that he achieved during his long life.

'We need to ensure that his legacy is sustained for the benefit of future generations.

'It is an honour to have the opportunity to play a part in these commemorations, and I am delighted to strike one of these special coins which will serve as a unique reminder of a great man.

'To do so with my young son is a special honour which encapsulates the important link between past, present and future.'

Shane Bissett, The Royal Mint's Director of Commemorative Coin and Medals said the mint first produced a commemorative coin bearing an image of Sir Winston Churchill to mark his death in 1965.

He added: 'Churchill holds a significant place in Britain's history as a great leader, soldier, artist and writer, not only acting as Prime Minister on two occasions but also leading the country twice through the dark days of war. 

'His image, reputation and legacy are instantly recognisable all over the world; therefore it is only fitting that he takes pride of place on The Royal Mint's third £20 for £20 coin.' 

Sir Winston is perhaps best known for his defiant Second World War speech vowing to 'never surrender' to Nazi Germany. 

The mint's coin comes as part of Churchill 2015 - an international celebration of the life and legacy of Sir Winston. 

Organisers say they hope it will keep his memory alive as well as educate and inspire future generations.
