Returned: Senka Besirevic spent £1,000 on a nine-month court case to win back her cat

It was a bitter custody fight  that took nine agonising months and cost £1,000.

At the heart of it? A black and white moggy called Brandy.

The tug-of-love saga began seven years ago after the cat disappeared from Senka Besirevic’s home.

The teaching assistant, who had received the week-old kitten as a present two years earlier, searched high and low for her pet and put up missing posters, but to no avail.

Meanwhile, unbeknown to her heartbroken owner, Brandy had set up home in a greenhouse in the garden of a property a mile away.

When Karen and Carl Green moved into the house in 2007, they discovered the sleeping cat and assumed she was a stray. 

So the couple fed and cared for her, fitted a cat-flap on the greenhouse and named her ‘Smelly’ in an affectionate reference to the sorry state they found her in.

Fast forward to March last year, however, and a trip to the vet revealed that the cat had a microchip identifying Miss Besirevic as her owner.

She was overjoyed to hear that her pet was safe and well. But things changed after she called the Greens to thank them for caring for the cat – and they refused to give her back.

Miss Besirevic said: ‘I got a call from my local vet who said a cat had been brought in and scanned and it was my cat.

‘I was amazed, I had given up hope of finding her but I thought it was a miracle she had turned up safe and well.

'I was given the telephone number of the woman who had cared for her so I phoned her up and said I wanted my cat back and offered to pay her for her trouble.

‘She said she was sorry but her husband didn’t agree, they were going to look into their legal rights.’ 

Miss Besirevic made inquiries and was advised that a cat remains the property of its original owner unless it is intentionally abandoned.

Like catnip: Brandy the cat is seemingly unaware that she had two women fighting for her love for nine months

‘Luckily, I found a solicitor who had
been through the same thing and took on my case,’ she said. ‘It was a 
huge battle, I felt like I had lost her for a second time.’

She launched a civil action at 
Birmingham County Court and the case was finally settled in January – 
when, curiously, Mr and Mrs Green, both 52, claimed Brandy had gone 
missing again.

A week later, the cat was handed in 
anonymously to an RSPCA rescue centre before being reunited with Miss 
Besirevic, 42, at last.

She said: ‘I'm just happy to have her back, it's incredible. She's still the same cat, she's very cute although she doesn't go out as much now. It's cost me money to get her back but it was worth every penny.

‘I have effectively been given custody of Brandy and I am determined not to lose her again. I love her.

‘It is just a shame I had to go to court to get her back.'

The
couple who took Brandy in defended their decision to fight 
her owner in the courts for custody over the cat, saying they did it 
‘out of love’.

Karen and Carl Green, both 52, took the cat in after moving into their home in Bartley Green, Birmingham, in 2007.

The couple, who have three short-haired cats of their own, fed Brandy who they believed was a stray.

Medical secretary Karen, who has two grown-up children, said: ‘We moved into our house and we were made aware that a cat was living in our greenhouse.

‘The neighbours said it was feral and it was in a bad way so I fed her and looked after her and eventually bonded with her. I considered her my pet in many ways.

‘We paid for her flea powder and food and just accepted her as one of our own.'

‘When I took her to the vet last year when she had a sticky eye I was horrified when they scanned her and said she belonged to a woman living nearby.

‘I didn't want to give her up to be honest.

‘We'd given her a good home, good food and plenty of space to run around. I didn't feel it was fair on her to be moved again even if Senka was her rightful owner.

‘We took legal advice because we felt that strongly but in the end our solicitor told us we didn't have a leg to stand on.

‘One day the cat went and was handed into the RSPCA.

‘Senka has the cat back but I really wish the cat was back her. The greenhouse seems empty without her.

‘The fact it went all the way to the courts is ridiculous but I suppose Senka and I both loved her and wanted the best for her.’
