Charged: 16-year-old Corey Labrecque was pulled over for impersonating a police officer

The boy was pulled over by the real cops and found to have a handun, handcuffs and was even wearing a police shirt

The teenager was also wearing a shirt that said 'police' on it and was even carrying law enforcement equipment, including a set of handcuff keys.

Police told WFTV that there was also a loaded handgun in the car although they are not stating where Labrecque got the gun and the vehicle.

Caught: The Hagerty High School teen had apparently been joy riding in a silver Chevy Impala with blue police lights

Unknown intentions: Police are not sure what the teenagers' intention was. He was carrying a loaded handgun in the car at the time he was pulled over by police

There are no reports of Labrecque trying to pull anyone over.

'What were his intentions driving the vehicle with a loaded gun?,' asked Labrecque’s neighbor Bonnie Baker. 'I hope it’s a misunderstanding.'

Labrecque went before a juvenile court judge on Sunday.

He was charged with impersonating a law enforcement officer and carrying a concealed weapon without a permit, which are both felonies.
