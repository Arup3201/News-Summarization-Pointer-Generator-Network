A violent ex-con has been charged with multiple counts in
the road rage shooting death of a 21-year-old female Georgia college student.

Sparkles Lindsay, 22, followed Kimberly Kilgore, 21, into
her gated apartment complex last year and shot her to death while her best
friend sat in the passenger seat and watched in horror, police say.

Ms Lindsay faces a charge of malice murder, two counts of
felony murder, aggravated assault, possession of a firearm by a convicted
felon, and possession of a firearm during commission of a felony, according to
the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

The 22-year-old and her friends reportedly had a heated
altercation with Ms Kilgore and friend Shannon Stone around 2am Oct 11 just
outside the Kennesaw apartment complex where Ms Kilgore lived, sources told the
paper.

Despite the complex being gated, Ms Lindsay drove into the
parking lot, and escalated the incident into a physical altercation. The
violent woman then pulled out a gun and fired multiple shots at Ms Kilgore,
police told multiple local media outlets.

Ms Stone helplessly watched her best friend get gunned down.

‘I was in the passenger seat and she was looking right at me
when it happened. I was the last sight she saw before her life was taken, and I
couldn’t stop it,’ the grieving friend told WSB.

Ms Lindsay and her friends then sped off into the night
while an ambulance raced to try to save Ms Kilgore’s life. The Kennesaw State
University student died later that night after being taken off life support.

The popular girl’s friends struggled to deal with her sudden
violent death.

‘This girl was my ride or die, I did everything with her,
she never separated,’ Ms Stone added. ‘She was always by my side.’

‘She was a beautiful person inside and out, Her personality
just lifted everybody up,’ an unnamed friend told WSB.

‘We are just praying for Kim's family,’ friend Emily Benton
told WXIA. ‘It is an indescribable feeling. We're just very heartbroken.’

Devastated: The restaurant where Ms Kilgore worked struggled to cope with her sudden violent death

Heartbroken: Friend Alisa Parnell questioned how such a violent death could happen to Ms Kilgore

The gang: The waitresses at the restaurant had a hard time coming to grips with Ms Kilgore not being there each weekend

Alisa Pannell struggled to talk through tears.

‘Kim, we love you and we’re gonna miss you,’ she told WSB,
adding ‘we’re walking around and can’t even describe the feeling… how can
somebody do that, how do you do that to an innocent person?’

Authorities have not publicly commented about the fight that
led to the shooting, but have said they do not believe the two women knew each
other.

Ms Lindsay was arrested only a few days later and booked
into Cobb County Jail on murder charges.

Just after the shooting: Ms Kilgore's apartment complex was mobbed by police and other emergency responders

Officials significantly upped the charges this week and
refused to grant bail.

WXIA first revealed Ms Lindsay’s violent criminal past,
which includes multiple arrests for battery, fighting in a public place, and
theft since 2009.

She had been released from prison only three months prior to
Ms Kilgore’s violent murder.

Sources told the Journal-Constitution that no arraignment
date has been set.
