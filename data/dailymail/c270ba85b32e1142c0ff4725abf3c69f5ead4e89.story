Examined: Convicted arsonist Cameron Todd Willingham was executed in 2004 for the murder of his three children. The evidence from the fire at his home is being re-examined

Evidence used to convict a man who was executed nine years ago for killing his three children in a fire - is to be re-examined.

Cameron 
Todd Willingham was put to death in 2004 after being found guilty of deliberately setting fire to his family's home in Corsicana, Texas in 1991.Â 

But the evidence used to convict him is now to be reassessed by the state's fire 
marshal and the 'Innocence Project' of Texas as part of a wider review of dozens of past convictions for arson.

Authorities in Texas and in other 
states are beginning to re-examine cases in which defendants were sent 
to prison for setting fires based on expert testimony about burn 
patterns and charring that today is considered suspect.

The Innocence Project, a national 
legal reform group that has worked to exonerate more than 250 convicts, 
has identified potentially problematic arson cases in several states, 
including one in Tucson, Arizona, in 1970 in which 29 people were 
killed.

In Texas, which has had to free more 
than 100 inmates wrongly convicted in criminal cases, the state 
Innocence Project has narrowed its working list to about 60 arson cases 
of the 1,000 reviewed, chief counsel Jeff Blackburn said.

A state expert panel, the Texas 
Forensic Science Commission, has also made 17 recommendations for 
improving how arson cases are handled.

The widespread attention given the Willingham case has driven interest in looking at other arson-related convictions. Willingham was convicted of killing 
his children after deliberately starting a fire the family's home in 
Corsicana, Texas on December 23, 1991. He was executed in 2004.

The Forensic Science Commission 
investigated the case for years, but was barred by Attorney General Greg
Abbott from issuing a final report.

Arson experts hired by the 
commission found the 1991 fire was most likely accidental. It is 
possible that problems will be found with more cases, State Fire Marshall Chris Connealy said.

Execution: The Polunsky Unit West Livingston, Texas, where Willingham was executed

'Having been around fire investigations and being in the fire service the last 35 years, I saw where there could be improvements,' he added.

'I wanted to try to lead that effort to improving fire investigations. It should be based on science.'

If the group finds problems with an 
arson investigation, its findings will be sent to the authorities with 
jurisdiction over the case and to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, 
Connealy said. No action will be required, but the report could help 
someone who is wrongly imprisoned

Convicted: Ed Graf is one of a number of men convicted of arson whose cases are now being re-examined by the authorities

Another case to be reviewed is that of 
Ed Graf - who was given life in prison 25 years ago for killing his two 
stepsons by locking them in a backyard shed and setting it on fire.

Two
investigators used photos of the shed's remains to persuade jurors that
Graf had started the fire intentionally. But by today's standards of 
fire analysis - the investigators may have been mistaken.

Representatives will meet next month to start reviewing the first six 
cases, including Graf's, who was convicted in 1988 of setting the deadly
fire in the central Texas town of Hewitt.

Graf is now a white-haired, 60-year-old man, who in a recent prison interview continued to maintain his innocence.

'I know that there will be people that 
will never change their mind, and of course, there will be people that 
will,' Graf said. 'It's difficult for me to believe they can't believe 
the science. The science, it's pretty accurate now.'

Graf's then-wife, Clare Bradburn, said she remains convinced he is guilty. Ms Bradburn said she remembers Graf acting suspiciously before and after the blaze.

Of the new questions about the arson investigation, she said, 'He got lucky. This might be his get-out-of-jail-free card.'

A final decision on a new trial is pending before the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. Mr Connealy would not take a position on Graf's innocence but wants to address any problems with old cases.

'I really won't know, personally, until we get into this,' he said. And that first opportunity will be in April.'
