Jose Mourinho was involved in an amazing half-time bust-up with his players as Chelsea appeared to blow their last chance of winning the title by drawing 0-0 with Norwich.

Sportsmail can reveal that Mourinho, who stormed down the tunnel at half-time, blasted a number of players including Nemanja Matic and Mohamed Salah for their shocking performances in the opening 45 minutes. He later admitted the first-half display was ‘lazy’.

The meltdown came before Ashley Cole walked off the field in tears as he prepares to leave the club after eight years.

It is understood manager Mourinho told Matic he was having serious reservations about the decision to bring him back to Stamford Bridge in the January transfer window.

Egypt winger Salah, who was dragged off at  half-time, was told to make sure he returned for  pre-season ‘ready to be a footballer’.

Mourinho then stormed out of the dressing room and appeared in the dug-out a few minutes before the start of the second half, sitting alone until his players came out.

Chelsea declined to comment on Sunday night.

Despite the disappointment of dropping two points against relegation-threatened Norwich, the Chelsea squad still completed a lap of the field after the final whistle.

But it was all too much for Cole, 33, who has won a Premier League, Champions League and four FA Cups since his controversial move from Arsenal in 2006.

Cole
 and Terry, together with Frank Lampard, who could also leave, 
acknowledged the Matthew Harding Stand at the end, fuelling speculation 
the trio, who have 1,609 Blues appearances between them, are finished at
 Chelsea.

However Mourinho, despite warning all three may have to wait before their futures are decided, believes they will stay.

‘Will they play at Stamford Bridge again? I think so, but the summer is a long summer for us,’ said the Portuguese.

‘For
 the players at the World Cup, it’s a different story. But for us, as a 
club, it’s a long time to be calm, to sit and discuss and analyse the 
market and possibilities. A long time.’

Mourinho
 admitted the season could have been better, adding: ‘We lost games 
where we had them under control but didn’t kill them and we were killed.
 But from day one, never in danger, never outside the top four or 
outside the title race.’
