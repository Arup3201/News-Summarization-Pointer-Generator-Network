James Holmes is returning to court later today for two weeks of hearings focusing on what evidence prosecutors can use against him in the Colorado theater shooting case.

Holmes is charged with killing 12 people and injuring 70 others in 2012. He pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.

Some of the evidence in dispute comes from two dating websites where Holmes set up accounts before the shootings.

Profile: The judge overseeing the movie theater shooting case will allow prosecutors to introduce evidence from the suspect's online dating profile

Holmes is charged with killing 12 people and wounding 70 when he opened fire at a Dark Knight Rises screening in the Denver suburb of Aurora last July

Prosecutors say that in his website profiles on Match.com and AdultFriendFinder.com, Holmes asked, 'Will you visit me in prison?'

Prosecutors say they plan to use that to show Holmes knew the shootings were wrong, undercutting his insanity plea.

Holmes is accused of opening fire in a crowded Aurora movie theater 
during a midnight show on July 20, 2012. He faces 166 counts, including 
murder and attempted murder.

Evidence? James Holmes created a profile on a popular sex website just days before the massacre

According to the judge's summary of the arguments, Holmes' created the 
Match.com account in April 2012 and the AdultFriendFinder.com account 
just 15 days before the shooting on July 20. Both were last accessed two
 days before the shooting.

Photos posted to both accounts showed 
Holmes with the orange-dyed hair made infamous in his first court 
appearance after the shooting.

The titles associated with Holmes' postings on both sites were, 'Will you visit me in prison?'

Loner: Holmes set up profiles on two dating websites just weeks before the shootings occured

Holmes created the profile on AdultFriendFinder.com on July 5, just two weeks before the shooting and included a picture of himself with reddish, orange hair.

Holmes, who used the screen name classicjimbo included a cryptic message on the top of the profile which read, 'Will you visit me in prison?'

In his profile, he described himself as he's 6'0" and single with an athletic body.

He said he was a 'light/social drinker', however in the section where he's asked if he smokes or does drugs, he answered, 'I'd prefer not to say.'

He also states his penis size as 'short/average'.

Disguised: Holmes was wearing body armour during the shooting and police initially thought he was one of them

'A reasonable inference may be drawn that the user of the accounts posted the question because he anticipated doing something that he was aware would warrant prison time,' Arapahoe County District Judge Carlos Samour's wrote.

The judge also wrote that evidence from both dating sites could be used in the trial in relation to the identification, sanity, intent, deliberation and culpable mental state of the suspect.

Samour overruled several distinct objections defense attorneys made in their attempt to have this evidence barred. That included objections about online dating posts' relevance, timing and the direct connection to the suspect.

The judge has already rejected one defense attempt to suppress the website evidence.

Lawyers for the shooter, James Holmes, have challenged the admissibility of almost all the key evidence in the case — from photos found on Holmes' iPhone to explosives seized in his apartment to statements he made to police after his arrest.

Defense attorneys argue that investigators seized the evidence without establishing a proper legal foundation, initially entered Holmes' apartment without a warrant and questioned Holmes after he asked for an attorney.

Prosecutors contend the evidence was seized properly and that their methods were justified by ongoing fears for the public's safety even after Holmes was arrested.

The judge's decision on the evidence could impact prosecutors' ability to argue that Holmes knew what he was doing was wrong — a key element in disproving Holmes' insanity plea.

A trial is scheduled for next year.
