Kim, Khloe and Kourtney have unveiled their fourth clothing collection for Lipsy but in between raising babies, planning weddings and filming for their hit reality TV show, it seems that the trio didn't find the time to model it.

While previous campaign shoots have seen
 the girls posing for notorious photographer Terry Richardson, they haven't been snapped in the range themselves this time around.

Despite not showcasing their designs, the famous sisters promise that their capsule collection of bright dresses and flattering pencil skirts will 'deliver LA style combined with hot off the runway looks.'

Following 
three consecutive sell-out collections, the girls have created outfits 
that they say reflect their own personal style, as well as incorporating
 key seasonal trends.

Speaking about the range, Khloe said: 'Florals, lace and lighter materials always feel very summery, and we’ve played around with the designs to also incorporate bright pops of color like coral red and neon pink.

'We’re California girls at heart, and I think that shows in our personal styles especially when it comes to our summer wardrobes, so we wanted our summer designs for Lipsy to reflect that as well.'

The colour palette for this collection includes fresh summer whites, fluorescent corals and zesty oranges.

Print wise, the girls have emblazoned bodycon dresses with tribal prints, while separates give a nod to the ‘underwear as outerwear’ trend with lingerie lace camis and co-ordinated lace-trimmed pencil skirts, as loved by Kim.

Kim said of the collection: 'Classic whites are essential for summer, and this collection includes some key pieces like the asymmetrical cut blazer and matching shorts that create the perfect combination for a sophisticated summertime look.

Seasonal trends: The capsule range is full of bright colours and pretty prints, which the girls say champion their own style as well as catwalk trends

'We’ve also reintroduced the slim spaghetti straps on our camis and slip dresses because they make for the perfect go-to styles on warm summer days.'

Kourtney added: 'I love mixing unexpected prints and fabrics. We have an amazing tribal print in our SS14 line that creates a really fun tropical summer vibe no matter where you are in the world.

'I’m also into soft, feminine looks for summer, so I love how we have reworked our signature lace fabrics into sexy lingerie style pieces that are great for mixing and matching.'

Jump to it: The girls are huge fans of jumpsuits so have ensured that there are plenty in the range, which is priced between £32-£85

As well as pretty summer dresses, which are priced between £32-£85, the girls have added jewellery, too.

Aside from designing the range, the girls have been busy lately, with Kim and little sister Kendall Jenner glamming it up at the Met Gala on Monday night.

Instead of mooching at home, Kourtney and Khloe hit their local bowling alley.

Kourtney,
 34, posted an Instagram snap of the pair enjoying the sport in Los 
Angeles while their sisters mingled with the fashion elite in New 
York.
