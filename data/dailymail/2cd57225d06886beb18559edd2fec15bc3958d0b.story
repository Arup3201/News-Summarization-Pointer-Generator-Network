The ex-boyfriend of Amy Winehouse appeared in court today charged with two counts of rape.

Reg Traviss, 35, had been seeing Amy for more than a year when she died aged 27 at her home in Camden, north London, last July.

The film director is accused of twice attacking a woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, at his home address in Marylebone, central London, last New Year’s Eve.

Traviss was first arrested over the allegations by the Metropolitan Police on April 28 and released on bail.

Dressed in a charcoal grey suit, black trousers, white shirt, and black tie, Traviss spoke only to confirm his identity during a brief hearing at Westminster Magistrates’ Court today.

These are two charges of rape from December 31 last year, in the early hours of that morning, against a female over the age of 16.

Traviss’ lawyer said he would deny the allegations at the crown court.

He was bailed to appear before Southwark Crown Court on September 12.

Traviss, who has made films including Psychosis, starring Charisma Carpenter and Darkness frontman Justin Hawkins, has not yet entered pleas to the two counts of rape.

Last year, Traviss revealed that he and the Back to Black singer had been planning to get married.

‘It wasn’t planned as in this date or that date, but it was a topic of conversation and had been for some time,’ he said.

He admitted that he still hadn't come to terms with the fact she has gone.

Speaking to the Sunday Times he said: 'What felt surreal was not the cameras and the craziness but losing somebody, just like that. One minute I was speaking to her, the next she was gone

'You might say we were halfway through a conversation in our life together and then, suddenly, she disappeared.'

A friend claimed the rape allegation came out of the blue.

‘He does know the woman who made the report to police and he completely denies the allegation,’ the friend told the Daily Mail.

‘He wants to do everything in his power to fight this.’
