Immigration activist and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Jose Antonio Vargas, who has lived and worked in the U.S. illegally for years, was released by U.S. Border Patrol agents on Tuesday after they detained him at a South Texas airport.

Vargas, who became an immigration activist after revealing that he was himself an illegal alien, was detained by U.S. Customs officials today after visiting a Texas border town.

Vargas founded the pro-immigration group Define American. He was pictured being handcuffed by Border Patrol officers as he tried to board a plane in McAllen, Texas.

Caught and released: This image, provided to the Huffington Post, shows Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Jose Antonio Vargas being handcuffed as he tried to fly out of McAllen International Airport on Tuesday. The Pulitzter Prize winner has lived and worked in the U.S. illegally for years. He was released by authorities later Tuesday evening

Border Patrol spokesman Omar Zamora said Vargas was stopped going through security at the airport in McAllen, only a few miles from the Mexico border.

A spokeswoman for Define American, Vargas' advocacy group, confirmed his release Tuesday afternoon.

It's common for the Border Patrol to release people on their own recognizances, with notices to appear in court later. With such notices, people can generally travel throughout the U.S. without being detained again.

He had traveled to the border city to participate in a vigil for the thousands of unaccompanied minors who are crossing the border illegally.

He said that it was not until he arrived in Southeast Texas that he realized people in the region were regularly stopped on the roads and at airports and asked for proof of legal residency.

Vargas has been openly flouting the law since June 2011, when he revealed in a New York Times Magazine story that he had come to the U.S. illegally at age 12 

Moments before he was taken way by Border Patrol agents, he tweeted a picture of his Filipino passport and a pocket copy of the U.S. Constitution and wrote: 'About to go thru security at McAllen Airport. I don't know what's going to happen.'

At the McAllen-Miller International Airport, only a few miles from the border, Border Patrol agents stand beside Transportation Security Administration agents to check documentation, even for domestic flights.

Video taken by the McAllen Monitor newspaper shows him handing over his immigration documents to a TSA agent. He is then question by a Border Patrol agent, who asks him to remove his backpack. The video cuts out as the agent approaches Vargas from behind, presumably to handcuff him. 

The Huffington Post published a picture, given to the news site by one of Vargas' traveling companions, of the celebrity journalist in cuffs.

His spokeswoman, Maria Cruz Lee, declined immediate comment. She said a statement would be issued later in the day.

The security situation at the McAllen airport - and elsewhere in the city - is familiar to the thousands of people living illegally in the U.S. along the Texas-Mexico border. Along highways out of the city, drivers are stopped at Border Patrol checkpoints about an hour's drive north of the border. And it's not uncommon for children who entered the country illegally with their parents to grow up in the Rio Grande Valley to stay home when classmates go on field trips along those roadways to San Antonio.

Vargas, a native of the Philippines, had flown to McAllen last Thursday to take part in a vigil. In an essay he wrote for Politico on Friday, Vargas said he has travelled in the U.S. for years without a problem but didn't realize that immigration checks are done on those driving or flying out of the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas. Vargas noted that he doesn't have any government-issued U.S. identification.

His last tweet Tuesday morning was a photograph of his Philippines passport and a palm-size copy of the U.S. Constitution.

Vargas went public about his immigration status in a 2011 piece for the New York Times Magazine. He was part of a team of reporters at the Washington Post that won a Pulitzer Prize in 2008. He also directed a documentary called 'Documented,' and founded the activist group 'Define American.'
