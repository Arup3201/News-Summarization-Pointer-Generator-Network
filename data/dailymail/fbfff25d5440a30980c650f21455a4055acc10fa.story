Lidl has come under fire for offering a ‘ten-minute free stay’ parking policy which fines visitors £90 if they stay a second over the limit.

A branch of the budget supermarket in Kent has installed the system in its camera-controlled car park to sting those who do not buy anything at the store.

Signs, under control of firm Athena ANPR, warn that by entering the ‘private land’ drivers automatically agree to a contract, meaning they must pay the fine if they overrun – or face debt collectors and even court action.

Those who do not make a purchase get hit with a £90 fine if they stay longer than ten minutes. 

The timing starts from the moment they enter the car park to the second they leave. It means they are expected to park, read the sign, get a trolley, go into the shop and exit all within the ten-minute limit.

Customers are expected to finish in just 60 minutes or face a £90 fine.

The recently refurbished Lidl, in Ashford, put up the signs earlier this month but the scheme only went live last weekend. 

Local resident Deidre Mewse, 51, called the new system ‘extortionate’.

‘The camera takes the time from entering the car park, so if you’re disabled and in a wheelchair, you would almost certainly fall foul of this,’ she said.

‘Also even if you were a customer, it would mean significantly less time than an hour to do your shopping, as you need time to pack the car, return the coin-operated trolley, get to your car and exit the car park.’

Lidl, which employs Athena ANPR to manage all its UK car parks, defended the system which it said ‘ensures that spaces are available for Lidl customers to use’ in ‘exceptionally busy’ locations.

A spokesman at the store said ‘previous misuse of the car park’ had meant customers not always being able to park, adding: ‘The vast majority of our customers are pleased with the implementation of these systems as … they are now able to access parking spaces when carrying out their shopping.’ 

AA president Edmund King has denounced the ‘cowboy tactics, scaremongering and bullying’ used by many private parking firms.

‘Often motorists know that they are in the right but when they get a letter that looks like an official fixed penalty notice, followed by a letter that looks like an official bailiff’s letter, they pay up because they are scared,’ he said.

Marc Gander, of the Consumer Action Group, said: ‘Private parking companies … making an industry of penalising people without good reason or for their simple human mistakes.

‘Big brands don’t seem to appreciate how this new industry operates or the sense of anger and injustice that it produces in its victims and who are also their own customers.’
