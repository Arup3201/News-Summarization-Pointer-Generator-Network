A policeman has apologised after tweeting a picture of officers horsing around in a children's playground.

Sergeant Pete Shaw came under fire after posting the image of himself and uniformed colleagues riding the play equipment while out on patrol in Tottenham, North London.

He captioned the picture: 'Out and about patrolling the patch #theserioussidetopolicing.' 

It has since been removed and replaced with an apology from Sgt Shaw from the Seven Sisters neighbourhood team.

Sergeant Pete Shaw faced a Twitter backlash after posting the picture of himself and colleagues messing around while out on a uniformed patrol in Tottenham, North London

The officer was slammed by some of his 600 followers on the social networking site before the tweet was removed. 

'Last time my neighbour needed the police you took 21/2 hours. No doubt she will think this is hilarious,' wrote Paddy Wagstaff, the Daily Mirror reported.

The newspaper said others questioned what fully grown men were doing on play equipment designed to be used by very small children.

In a twitter apology Sergeant Shaw posted: 'Apologies if the previous tweet was thought inappropriate. SNT officers were in the Markfield Park area targeting anti-social behaviour.'

Colleagues sent the officer messages of support, with one responding: 'it shows we're human&capable of having a laugh! And so much ASB occurs in play parks at night - it's a deterrent.'

A spokesman for Scotland Yard said: 'Officers from the Seven Sisters Safer Neighbourhoods team based in Haringey were on routine patrol in the Markfield Park area as part of ongoing activity to target anti-social behaviour.

'Local MPS Twitter accounts are a useful tool to engage with the local community and provide residents with another means to contact officers direct.

'The tweet has since been deleted.'
