Prosecutors say they won't use any photos of a 17-year-old's genitals in their effort to prove a sexting case against the teen.

The teen had previously been subject to a search warrant demanding photos of his erect penis.

The Washington Post reports that prosecutors moved ahead with plans to prosecute the teen during a closed hearing Tuesday in juvenile court. The teen's attorney, Jessica Harbeson Foster, says prosecutors told the judge that the photos were not necessary.

'It's an outrageous case,' Foster told AFP.

The teen left the state to evade a search warrant demanding photos of his erect penis. Authorities were trying to prove he sent similar pictures to his then-15-year-old girlfriend.

Facing severe criticism, police said last week they would no longer seek those photos. And at Tuesday's hearing, prosecutors said they would not use other photos of his genitals that had already been taken.

Prosecutors in Prince William County earlier told a judge they needed photos of the 17-year-old's erect penis.

Foster said she is unaware of any cases where police have pursued similar photographs, particularly of a minor.

'This is crazy,' she said. 'Nobody's even heard of something like this. ... The charges are excessive, and the means by which they are seeking evidence are outrageous.'

The teen's appointed guardian ad litem, Carlos Flores Laboy, said his understanding is that police planned to do some sort of computer analysis of the photos to try and prove a similarity to the explicit photo found on the girl's phone. He said the search warrant vividly demonstrates the importance of defending individuals' constitutional rights against invasions of privacy.

'Doing this to an adult would be traumatic. We're talking about a 17-year-old child. Doing it to a 17-year-old would be even worse,' he said.

A guardian ad litem is an attorney appointed to serve as an advocate in certain juvenile cases.

The Associated Press isn't naming the teen or his aunt in accordance with a policy of not identifying juvenile suspects.

Police have been pursuing the case since January, the aunt said, when the girlfriend's mom discovered the explicit content.

She said prosecutors insisted on getting the photographs after her nephew turned down a plea deal that would have required a year of probation in which he would be forbidden from using a cellphone or the Internet. She was concerned that a slipup on probation — even a single use of a social media account like Facebook or Twitter — would leave him exposed to a felony record and a requirement to register as a sex offender.

She said her nephew has received a lot of support since the case was first reported last week on WRC-TV, the NBC affiliate in Washington.

Police and prosecutors did not return calls Wednesday afternoon seeking comment.

The Manassas City Police later posted a statement on its website saying that it is not their policy 'to authorize invasive search procedures of suspects in cases of this nature and no such procedures have been conducted in this case.'

The statement added that police were contacted by the mother of the 15-year-old girl 'who was sent pornographic videos' by the 17-year-old 'after repeatedly being told to stop.'
