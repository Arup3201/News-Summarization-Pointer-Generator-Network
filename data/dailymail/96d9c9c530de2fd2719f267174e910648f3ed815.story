A father who hanged himself in woods had a picture of his dead body posted on Twitter by mistake after an unwitting dog walker wrongly believed he was a 'ghoulish mannequin'.

The passer-by spotted Robert Pilcher, 23, and unwittingly assumed his body was a giant Halloween dummy as part of a sick prank.

He took a picture, uploaded it on social media and even tweeted it to his local council demanding it be removed - only to be tracked down by police later and told the tragic truth.

Robert Pilcher took his own life weeks after the birth of his son Bobby James. His body was found hanging in woods near his home in Cleveleys, Lancs

An inquest was told sheet metal worker Mr Pilcher, who was suffering from depression, had taken his own life just eight weeks after the birth of his first son Bobby James.

He had been split from Bobby's mother Jayne Marr, 25, and discovered his mother Elaine had been diagnosed with terminal cancer.

He had moved out of the family home in Fleetwood, Lancs and was staying with a female friend he had known for six years, Savannah Sinclair.

On the night before he died in October last year, Mr Pilcher visited Bobby and made a last ditch attempt to rekindle his romance with Miss Marr - but she said they couldn't get back together.

In a statement Miss Sinclair said she had called 999 to report Robert missing after he left the house telling her he was going for a walk, yet failed to take his mobile phone.

She said: 'He had recently had a baby with his partner. He text to see if my couch was free, I spoke to Robert and he said he wanted to pay off his debts like his phone bill, nothing serious.

'He never intimated that he wanted to take his own life. He would say, "everybody would be better if I wasn't here" and "nobody would notice if I wasn't". He did get down.'

Friends say they had no idea the 'larger than life' sheet metal worker was intent on committing suicide

Miss Sinclair added that she knew his mum was very ill with cancer and they would often sit and talk about it.

She added: 'He recently thought about visiting the doctor about depression but I'm not sure if he did.

'Because of his recent frame of mind I kept an eye on him and checked his bag but I never found anything.'

She said that Mr Pilcher had looked 'a bit down' but when she asked if he wanted to talk he said he would in the morning.

Miss Sinclair said that before she went to bed she saw him walk away and he gestured that he was going for a walk. She added that she asked him not to go.

Mr Pilcher, who had attempted suicide before, was a keen skateboarder who coached young skaters at a local YMCA

Police were called to the scene in woodland known as The Towers the following morning.

Det Insp Andrew Bunn of Lancashire Police said the location was accessible to the public yet would have been secluded at the time Mr Pilcher went.

The officer said the dog walker had taken the picture in good faith because he had been concerned children might be shocked.

He said: 'The picture of him whilst still hanging was put on Twitter, inquiries were made and we spoke to the person who had put it on the website.

'It was in good faith, a man walking his dog in the early hours. He didn't think it was a body but that it was some sort of ghoulish mannequin. He sent it to Wyre Council asking it to be removed.'

The hearing in Fleetwood was told police investigated 'insensitive messages' on social media sites which caused distress to Robert's family, but there had been nothing suspicious.

In a statement, Mr Pilcher's father Chris, 51, said: 'Robert had made several half-hearted attempts to take his own life using pills. It last took place a couple of years ago.

'I felt they were cries for help. He suffered from what I would describe as depression but he would never accept it or seek advice.'

He said on the occasions when he had seen medical professionals Robert 'always knew what to say to get discharged'.

Mr Pilcher Snr added: 'His mother had terminal cancer and he recently split from his partner but there was nothing about his behaviour for me to have any concerns about his welfare.

'The night before he died had been to see his son and ex-partner and asked if he could get back together, she said no. He sent a text to his mum saying he loved her.'

The hearing was told Elaine, 48, passed away last January.

Recording a verdict of suicide, Coroner Mr Simon Jones said: 'It was a publicly accessible area and there's some degree of planning. There was no written expression of intent.

'I'm satisfied that what he has done has been done intentionally. '

Mr Pilcher was a keen skateboarder who coached younger enthusiasts at a local YMCA.

In interview with the family's local paper at the time of the tragedy Mr Pilcher's late mother, Elaine, said: 'We didn't know he was that sad because he didn't give any warning signs, he just texted me on Monday telling me he loved me.

'I replied straight away asking if he was OK and I tried to ring him back but he had already turned his phone off.

'He was a fun-loving guy who had just become a father and had his whole life ahead of him. He was larger than life and unmistakable - a gentle giant and very friendly.

'When he became a father I thought he would get on with his life. I never thought this would happen, so it came as a complete shock and he will be greatly missed by everyone who knew him.'
