A 95-year-old woman who walks with a stick has become one of the world's oldest bungee jumpers.

Margit Tall did not even scream during the 150m plunge from a crane near her home in Helsinki, Finland, after saying she was determined to make the leap before she died.

Employees of the bungee jumping firm assumed she was joking when she told them she was born in 1919 and asked if there was an age limit.

Never too late to learn: Margit Tall has become one of the world's oldest bungee jumpers after leaping off a 150m crane near her home in Helsinki, Finland, at the age of 95. Pictured: Mrs Tall just before the jump

Mrs Tall is now thought to be the world's oldest female bungee jumper, beaten only to the title of world's oldest by 96-year-old Mohr Keet, who leapt from South Africa's Blaukrans Bridge in 2010.

The previous record for the oldest woman is believed to have been held by Frances Gabe, who celebrated her 91st birthday in 2011 with a solo jump in Fresno, California. 

Daredevil pensioner Mrs Tall went ahead with her jump despite concerns from staff at Skybreakers, who ensured she did a tandem jump to lessen the impact on her body.

Organiser Taneli Fils said: 'She wasn't scared at all. She didn't even scream during the jump.

'When she came to buy a ticket she asked if there was an age limit and we all thought she was joking. 

Dramatic: The pensioner was then lowered onto a landing area in the lake below. Organiser Taneli Fils said: 'She wasn't scared at all. She didn't even scream during the jump. She told us she was born in 1919'

'She told us she was born in 1919 and at first we tried to convince her not to jump because we didn't want to kill her but she was determined.

'We asked her what her children thought of her doing this and she told us she just had one child who was already 70, so we didn't need to worry about them.'

The jump was believed to be the highest in Finland. 

Mr Fils added: 'We decided she should do a tandem jump with one of our heaviest guys. If she had jumped alone the free fall which would have been too much for her body.

'Some of our customers start shaking before the jump and some are shaking after the jump. Some go up but are too scared to jump so we have to bring them back down. 

Emotional: Mrs Tall, pictured with her jumping partner, said she wanted to take the plunge before she dies

Daunting: At 150 metres, the crane jump is believed to be the highest on offer in the whole of Finland

'You reach a speed of nearly 75mph when you jump and when the rope pulls you back up for the first time, the speed is almost 50mph.'

He added: 'Margit did a tandem jump with our heaviest guy because the total weight was almost the maximum possible, the rope was stretching more than usual and the ride was smoother.

'During a bungee jump you are fighting against yourself because brains are telling you don't jump, this isn't safe, the rope can fail, you are too high but if you can overcome your fears you'll feel great.

'She didn't seemed bothered at all though - she was amazing.'
