Objects belonging to or signed by the late former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher are being auctioned online

Two pairs of black satin Rayne heels - one pair of pumps, one pair of stilettos - owned and worn by Margaret Thatcher while she was Prime Minister are being auctioned this month alongside other items owned or signed by the Iron Lady.

The stiletto-heeled slingbacks with a gold and black diamante cross strap - for which the current bid is £150 - were owned by Baroness Thatcher between 1988 and 1991, as were the black silk high-heeled pumps with diamante heel detail, for which the current bid is £100.

The insoles of both pairs of shoes bear the Rayne Royal Warrant, and the left shoe insole on each pair insole includes the wording 'Made especially for Mrs Margaret Thatcher'.

Rayne also made shoes for The Queen, The Queen Mother, the Princess Royal, and Diana, Princess of Wales.

The shoes are accompanied by a letter of provenance from the consignor explaining how the shoes were gifted to staff members at the Prime Minister's country retreat, Chequers, following her resignation.

Adrian Roose, director of Paul Fraser Collectibles who are holding the online auctions in Guernsey, said: 'We've seen a marked increase of interest in Thatcher memorabilia recently.

'Maggie's handbag sold at auction for over £100,000 so it'll be interesting to see how well the shoes do.'

Further lots commemorating the late Baroness Thatcher, who died on 8 April in London, include a signed 'Call Day' menu from the day the barrister was called to the Bar, dated 1954.

The menu bears numerous autographs, including that of Lady Thatcher on the reverse in black ink.
