The married New York mother who was murdered while on a solo trip to Turkey had sex the day before she vanished with a man she met on the internet, he has claimed.

'Taylan K' has been interviewed at length by Istanbul police after they discovered his online communication with 33-year-old Sarai Sierra, but he had initially insisted they were just friends.

Now Turkey's Vatan newspaper has claimed Taylan told police they had consensual sex a day before Sierra went missing. The duo had met online months before Sierra left for Turkey on January 7.

It adds yet more intrigue to the circumstances surrounding Sierra's death after earlier reports she was hanging out with 'a criminal element' before she was killed. The FBI is also reportedly investigating whether she was involved in drug trafficking during her visit to the country.

Murdered:
 The body of amateur photographer Sarai Sierra was found in Istanbul on 
Saturday; a man she met on the internet has now claimed they had consensual sex the day before

Tryst: She reportedly met the man, identified as 'Taylan', when he commented on her Instagram page

Taylan, who first met Sierra online 
several months ago when he commented on one of her photographs on 
Instagram, denied having any part in her disappearance or murder.

He added that he sent her a message on the day she vanished and asked her to meet, but she never responded. Police have taken a blood and sperm sample from Taylan and 21 others.

Claims: Turkey's Vatan newspaper reported that Taylan had sex with the married mother of two

Sierra's body was 
found stashed by Istanbul's ancient city walls on Saturday, more than a 
week after she failed to catch her flight home. Police said she died 
from a blunt force trauma.

She was found with a head wound and a blanket near her body. She was
 wearing jeans, a jumper and a jacket, and still had her earrings and a 
bracelet on, but her iPhone and iPad were missing.

The claims come on the same day as a source familiar with her murder investigation has suggested she had been hanging out with 'a criminal element' while on the trip.

FBI agents investigating the killing 
do not believe she had only travelled to the country to take pictures, 
as her family has claimed.

'The first people she met up with were a criminal element,' the source told the New York Post. 'There are some 
witness reports that she was seen with sketchy characters.'

Authorities are now trying to verify 
these claims amid reports that her casket will be sent back to the 
United States on Thursday, the Post reported.

Among various lines of inquiry investigators are looking into a possible connection to drug trafficking.

Sierra, who had been unemployed and 
had declared bankruptcy in 2005, had also travelled to Amsterdam and 
Munich while on the trip, which was her first time leaving the United 
States.

She had 
initially planned to visit the country for three weeks, but after 12 
days she posted online that she had to cut the trip short.

Journey: Authorities said the mother of two had died from a blunt force trauma to the head

Her
 family, including her devastated husband Steven Sierra, have said she 
went to the country because of the photo opportunities. They say she 
used her iPad and iPhone to shoot the images.

To pay for her funeral, her family began selling some of her images online on Tuesday and soon had enough to cover her expenses.

The photos remain on sale online and any other profits will go to her two young sons, who are nine and 11, her family wrote on the website.

Photographs on sale include images taken during her time in Istanbul and pictures of New York City. They are being sold as canvases, framed prints, greeting cards and iPhone cases for $39.95 each.

'Sarai's passion for photography and love for capturing the beauty we see in culture, architecture and scenery was her reason for traveling to Istanbul,' her brother, David Jimenez, wrote on the site.

He added this afternoon: 'Thank you 
for all the support in purchasing Sarai's pictures. Quick update, all 
expenses for Sarai's funeral have been paid for!

'From
 here on out any picture of hers that you purchase will NOT be going 
towards her funeral. All funds will be going to her children. Thank you 
for your support. David.'

The outpouring of support comes hours
 after Sierra's devastated husband, Steven, revealed how he is consumed 
with sadness at his wife's death.

Mr Sierra, 40, left their home in 
Staten Island for Istanbul last week to help search for his wife, after 
she failed to get on a flight back to the U.S. on January 21 - but the 
trip ended in heartbreak.

Loved: Sarai is pictured with her two sons, who are now 9 and 11. They do not know their mother is dead

'I'm heartbroken,' Mr Sierra, who was married to Sarai for 14 years, told the New York Daily News, weeping. 'This is something you never want to imagine, and it's something I'd never want anyone to experience.

'You
 have so many plans, so many dreams with the person you deeply love. You
 look forward to many years together and there are so many things you 
haven’t fulfilled with that person, and now those won’t be fulfilled.'

His two sons, who are aged nine and 11, still do not know their mother 
is dead. Mr Sierra told the Daily News he is waiting until he returns 
home to tell the boys face-to-face.

Turkish police hope DNA samples from 21 people being questioned in the 
case will be key to finding the perpetrators, according to state run media.

Her mother told the Today show: 'It was such a shock when we heard. She was supposed to come back and she didn't.

'Her little boys do not know, their father will talk to them once he gets back. We will all be present for this.

'It was the first time she was going overseas after getting into 
photography college. She wanted to go there and take pictures of bridges and
 the history of the city.'

Sierra had left for Istanbul on January 7 to explore her photography hobby, her family said.

She
 was in regular contact with friends and relatives, and had told them 
she would visit Galata Bridge, which spans Istanbul's Golden Horn 
waterway, to take photos.

CBS News reported that shortly after 
Sierra's body was discovered, a woman came forward and told police she 
had seen a white car parked near the city walls as she was driving there
 the night of January 29, Anadolu reported.

The eyewitness said a man was trying to remove 'something' from the car, at which point she caught a glimpse of a woman's hand.

The
 news came after police in Istanbul detained and released a man who was
 one of the last in contact with the missing mother, who vanished the 
same day she planned to meet up with him.

The man only identified as 'Taylan' on 
social media sites was taken into police custody after questioning on 
the disappearance of the woman.

Turkish news reports said Sierra had arranged to meet her contact, 'Taylan,' on Galata Bridge she wanted to photograph the day she went missing.

It was about a mile from Sierra's hostel, Dogan news agency reported but it's not known if the meeting had actually taken place.

'We
 did not meet that day, but we had met before,' Taylan told police while
 adding that it was four months ago that they met for the first time 
online, Turkish paper the daily Hürriyet reports.

Authorities scoured security 
camera images near to the bridge to see if the meeting did in fact take 
place, the news agency said.

Last images: Sarai Sierra is seen on CCTV just before she vanished in January

Last week, Turkish police released security camera footage showing the 
missing mother at a mall near her hostel hours before she disappeared.

Sierra can be seen eating lunch and walking through the mall on January 20 - a day before she was supposed to catch a flight back home.

Her family last heard from her on Jan. 21, when she was supposed to start her journey home, but she never checked into her flight.
