Baltimore Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti has said he would consider rehiring disgraced football star Ray Rice.

In a press conference on Monday he said that 'five years down the line' he could see him bringing Rice back, believing he could redeem himself.

He also said of Ray and his wife Janay, 'I think they're going to be two very successful members of our community in the years to come.'

Rice was terminated by the Ravens earlier this month when video emerged of him punching his wife in an Atlantic City casino elevator. 

This comes on the same day the Ravens denied claims made in a report that  they knew about Rice's violent domestic assault hours after the incident occurred, and then pleaded with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell to go easy on the wife-beater.

Bisciotti and members of the team refuted 15 of the claims made in a recent ESPN report in an eight-page statement, which is addressed to fans of the team.

Bisciotti also stated that those who spoke with ESPN's Outside the Lines were 'sources [who] work for Ray,' and that much of the information they gave was 'manufactured.'

He believes Rice is using his friends to talk to the media in hopes of building up a case for reinstatement.

ESPN reported last week that the Ravens head of security Darren Sanders was told about the incident, and video, involving Rice and his then-fiancée Janay Palmer by a local police officer just hours after it happened, and then immediately described the event in detail to team executives.

They also said these claims had been corroborated by team officials, current and former league officials, NFL Players' Association representatives and associates, and advisers and friends of Rice.

In their statement released on Monday, the Ravens disputed all of these facts.

Sanders said that he did not see the tape, and actually had to ask the Atlantic City Police Department for a copy days after the incident.

After they refused to send him a tape, one officer did describe to him the events happening in the elevator, but not as they were later seen when the tape was released to the public earlier this month. 

'As he described it, Janay appeared to initiate the altercation, but they both spit at and struck each other, resulting in Janay falling and hitting her head against the wall railing,' said Sanders. 

'The officer could not tell from the video whether Ray slapped or punched her, but Ray told me very clearly that he did not punch her.'

Denied: Bisciotti (second from left) also shot down claims he asked NFL commissioner Roger Goodell (second from right, presenting Bisciotti with the Lombardi Trophy in 2013) to go easy on Rice following the incident

They next took on claims that Goodell went easy on Rice as a favor to his close friend Bisciotti.

'I did not ask Roger Goodell to give Ray Rice no more than a two-game suspension,' said Bisciotti. 

'I did not make any request for a "favor" or any particular outcome.' 

He then stated of his relationship with Goodell, 'The two of us have spent very little time together - as I recall, one round of golf and one dinner several years ago.' 

He did however admit that team executives did fail when they did not push harder to get a copy of the tape.

Later in the day, during a news conference, Bisciotti said, "The majority of the sources [from the report] are people that work for Ray.

Almost everything in there is anonymous, but it's clear from the subject matter that it's Ray's attorney, it's Ray's agent, it's Ray's friends.'

According to ESPN, he then said that a significant amount of the information in the story was 'manufactured' by members of Rice's camp.

Josh Krulewitz, ESPN's vice president of communications, went on Twitter on Monday afternoon following the Ravens statement and Bisciotti's news conference to say, 'We stand by our reporting.'
