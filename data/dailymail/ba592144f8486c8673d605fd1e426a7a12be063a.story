A wheelchair-bound man believed to have been under police protection following a gangland shooting is fighting for his life after being shot in the head in an apparent revenge attack.

The disabled man was in a bungalow -  said by neighbours to be a police 'safe house' - when he was blasted six times this morning.

The dramatic shooting happened just yards from the house of wanted Al Qaeda terror suspect Samantha Lewthwaite’s sister in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire.

Violence: The disabled man was in a bungalow - said by neighbours to be a police 'safe house' - when he was blasted six times this morning

Neighbours on the quiet street said the victim - aged in his 30s - had moved into the property about four months ago but was rarely there.

They said he had been left in a wheelchair as a result of being shot previously, believed to have been in London.

The street descended into chaos around 9.45am when at least half a dozen shots were fired.

Armed response units arrived within minutes and a search of surrounding houses and gardens was carried out.

Investigation: Forensic experts have been working in the property and gardens and well as in the surrounding areas in an attempt to find the gunman

The man was carried from the bungalow on a stretcher into a waiting ambulance with what neighbours described as gunshot wounds to the head.

A visibly shaken neighbour, who asked
not to be named, said: 'The victim moved in about four months ago but 
was never here. I’ve only noticed him in the past week.

'He’s
in a wheelchair because he had been shot before. I have heard that he 
was under police protection and that’s why he had moved in here.

'He definitely wasn’t from around here and spoke with a London accent.

'I
heard the gunshots and then there were loads of police, riot vans - the
lot. There were loads of armed police too who were still searching for 
him (the gunman).

'Then after a while they took the man out the house on a stretcher. He had wounds to his head and was shouting out in pain.'

A police cordon remained in place tonight covering a large section of the street and a field which backs onto it.

Forensic experts were working in the property and gardens and well as in the surrounding areas as detectives attempted to piece together events surrounding the gun attack.
