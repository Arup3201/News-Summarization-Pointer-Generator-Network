The birth of Prince George earlier saw advertising firms spring into action as they rushed a succession of humorous ads onto billboards up and down the country.

Among them were Ryanair, temporarily renamed 'Ryanheir' and bakers Warburton, which produced a cheeky ad that showed a bun being removed from an oven by a pair of Union Jack gloved hands and quipped: 'One's bun is done'.

But as these hilarious examples show, the birth of the royal baby isn't the only event to have inspired an ad. Like his nephew, Prince Harry has inspired some - though he probably won't want to dwell on the news behind them.

Prince Harry’s birthday-suit shenanigans in Vegas made international headlines. Here, an alluring scent takes the blame for our royal lothario's behaviour

Following England's disappointing exit from Euro 2012, these advertisers felt the fans might need cheering up, and what better than catching some sun

The never ending cycle of Chelsea FC's managers was the butt of the joke following the return of former manager Jose Mourinho

The now-infamous strip billiards game in Las Vegas resulted in a succession of ads courtesy of the Las Vegas tourist board, which followed up with one aimed at Prince George this week which read: 'See you in 21 years'.

Another ad inspired by Prince Harry's birthday suit shenanigans was created by deodorant brand Lynx. Referencing the brand's 'Lynx Effect', the strapline read: 'Sorry Harry... if it had anything to do with us.'

Other brilliant ads that made the most of the news include Gareth Southgate's famous Pizza Hut ad after the defender missed a penalty and sent England crashing out of Euro 96.

EasyJet followed suit when England's disappointing form at Euro 2012 ended in ignominious defeat, releasing an ad that read: 'Tears dry faster in the sun. Make England's exit easier to deal with. Where are you going?

P&O Cruises is another travel 
company that's no stranger to newsjacking. After Katie Holmes left Tom 
Cruise, it couldn't resist a tongue-in-cheek campaign with a strapline 
that read: 'Hey Katie, here's a cruise you won't want to leave!'

The images have been collated by advertising agency Inferno which also runs a website, trendjacking,com, that contains an archive of newsjacking ads.

'Brands can demonstrate that they’re culturally relevant by tapping into the news agenda,' revealed Inferno's innovation director, Luis Carranza. 'By riding on the hype of current affairs brands can become part of the news.

'People have become great at ignoring traditional advertising. Clever advertising increasing turns to borrowed relevance, known as newsjacking or trendjacking.

'Ask any comedian and they'll tell you that timing is everything, but in marketing, you need timing and relevance and a good brand fit. You have to get this balance right or potentially face a backlash or worse, be ignored.

'The bigger the news story, the greater the payoff. Most trendjacking ads fail to make any impact, but the good ones become part of the story for years to come.'

Other brands to have capitalised on memorable news include Ford, Mini, O2, Newcastle Brown Ale, Virgin and Specsavers. But the award for the most entertaining ad of all probably has to go to Konnectbus.

The ad, carried on the back of the company's coaches, read: 'So cheap even an MP wouldn't claim it back: A month's unlimited travel between Norwich and Walton for as little as £3 per day'. Few frustrated voters could fail to raise a smile at that.
