Former presidential hopeful Mitt Romney is to break his silence in his first interview since his failed election bid.

Romney has been keeping a low profile since conceding defeat to President Barack Obama at the election in November, but is set to make a return to the public eye with an appearance on Fox News Sunday alongside wife Ann.

The former Republican nominee is also due to address the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington next month.

Gracious in defeat: Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney, seen with wife Ann after conceding defeat to Barack Obama in November, has given his first interview since the election

Host Chris Wallace told the Washington Post the former Massachusetts governor and his wife will sit for an interview with Fox News Sunday next week.

Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, lost to President Obama by a margin of 332 to 206 electoral college votes.

He spent the month after the failed White House bid in solitude at his beachfront mansion in La Jolla, near San Diego, reflecting upon the campaign.

But almost four months on it is thought Romney is ready to return to public life and political debate.

He
 is expected to receive a warm reception at the upcoming conference in 
Prince George's County, Maryland, where he is due to deliver a speech on
 the economy.

A senior 
Romney aide has said the former Republican nominee would be taking the 
opportunity to 'thank all his supporters and friends' following the 2012
 campaign.

American Conservative Union chairman Al Cardenas has said of Romney's slot at the conference: 'We look forward to hearing Governor Romney's comments on the current state of affairs in America and the world, and his perspective on the future of the conservative movement.'

Romney - who unlike other failed presidential candidates such as John McCain did not have a job in the Senate to go back to after the election - has taken up a seat on the board of Marriott hotels on a salary of $170,000.

The former boss of hedge fund Bain Capital is also believed to be considering setting up an organisation similar to the Clinton Global Initiative, established by former President Bill Clinton in 2005.

Former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin is also set to speak at the event next month, as is Romney's former running mate Paul Ryan.
