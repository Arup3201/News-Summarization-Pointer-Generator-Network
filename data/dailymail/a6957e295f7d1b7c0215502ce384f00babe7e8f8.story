Police searching for five-year-old April Jones fear her body could have been swept out into the Irish Sea and may never be found.

The little girl has been missing presumed dead for more than a week after disappearing from the Bryn-y-Gog estate in the mid Wales town of Machynlleth on October 1.

This week, detectives revealed that if April's body was dumped in the river, it could have made 
its way 20 miles along the River Dyfi to the Irish Sea and may never be recovered.

It also emerged that search teams have begun combing old mineshafts, caves and potholes in the area in the hunt for her body.

Meanwhile, former lifeguard Mark Bridger has 
been charged with her abduction and murder and he appeared 
before Caernarfon Crown Court via video link today. He was remanded in custody until January 11.

Bridger also faces charges of unlawfully disposing of and concealing her body with intent to pervert the course of justice.

The 46-year-old confirmed his name and that he could hear the proceedings. He was wearing thin-rimmed glasses and a black jumper and sat in front of a grey curtain.

In the two days following April's disappearance, heavy rain flooded the already swollen River Dyfi.

Police rescue teams and expert divers spent several days searching the river last week but to no avail.

Photographs
and television footage showed fast moving rapids which 
would have reduced the chances of April's body being caught on the banks
or being snagged in trees.

A police source told The Sun: 'The currents could have taken her miles out and it may prove impossible to find her.'

Meanwhile, rescue experts have been using special equipment to search the holes in the foothills of Snowdonia National Park since last week - many of which are flooded, the Daily Mirror said. 

One resident, who described the hills as a 'warren' told the newspaper: 
'What makes it so difficult is that many of them are flooded and 
inter-linked. It could take a lifetime to search them all.'

rescue teams from Aberdyfi, Aberystwyth, New Quay and Borth have been 
involved in the hunt for April as well as members of the teams from 
Aberdaron, Bangor, Penmon, Dee and Rhyl.

Meanwhile,
volunteer mountain rescue search teams have combed through more than 
230 areas covering 70 sq km, while 100 police officers from 18 
specialist units have been on the ground.

Forensics officers have also spent several days searching Bridger's home, looking in outbuildings, lifting up paving slabs and looking in drains.

April vanished last Monday night and Bridger was arrested the following day.

She had been allowed to play out later than normal as a treat for a glowing school report she received.

On Monday, Bridger was remanded in custody after appearing before magistrates in Aberystwyth, when the police van carrying him was attacked and he was sworn at by an angry crowd.

A terrified couple revealed their home was stormed by police after vile web pranksters claimed they had kidnapped missing April.

Kevin Murphy, 43, and Debbie Maidment, 45, from Sheerness, Kent, were left shocked when officers swooped on their home last Sunday after claims on Facebook they had the Welsh schoolgirl.

The message was posted on a Facebook group on Sunday morning, which sparked a deluge of calls from concerned friends and relatives.

Then at 9.45pm that evening police descended on their home and began to rummage through every crevice of the couple’s home.

Astonishingly they have alleged that the hoax message is the latest attack in a five-year hate campaign orchestrated by an estranged member of Mr Murphy’s family.

Mr Murphy, 43, said: 'The police just went through opening cupboards, searching everything down to the smallest carrier bag.

'It would have hampered the search because they don’t need to be searching here when they could be spending time doing what they set out to do.

'How many hundreds of miles are we from Wales? I’ve never lived in Wales in my life. It has just been a plague of prank calls. They have put on Facebook that I’m a paedophile, I’m a rapist, that I stab people with knives.

'When the old man that went missing from a home in Canterbury was in the news, they put on Facebook that we had him and the police came and searched my house for him.'

A Kent Police spokesman said: 'We are aware of a malicious hoax Facebook message claiming that missing April Jones is at an address in Kent.

'This is completely false and officers are making inquiries into the origins of this hoax.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
