Think of solar panels and vast ‘fields’ of blue silicon or a patchwork of panels covering a roof probably spring to mind.

But now scientists have developed a breakthrough type of solar panel that can be placed directly over a window to harvest the sun’s energy, while remaining completely transparent.

The technology could lead to self-sufficient buildings or mobile phone screens that charge handsets when left in sunlight.

Scientists say the ‘transparent luminescent solar concentrator’ (pictured) could be used on buildings, mobiles and ‘any other device that has a clear surface. The solar harvesting material  uses specially-developed organic molecules to absorb certain invisible wavelengths of sunlight and convert it to electricity

Researchers at Michigan State University developed the ‘transparent luminescent solar concentrator’ which they say could be used on buildings, mobiles and ‘any other device that has a clear surface’.

For years scientists have tried to produce energy harvested from solar cells made from luminescent plastic-like materials, but the technologies have performed poorly. The energy production was inefficient and the materials were highly coloured.

‘No one wants to sit behind coloured glass,’ said Richard Lunt, an assistant professor of chemical engineering and materials science at the university. 

The technology used in the transparent material (pictured left) could lead to glass skyscrapers such as London's Shard (pictured right) becoming self-sufficient  buildings covered in solar panels that are still light and airy to live in, or mobile phone screens that charge handsets in the daylight

The solar harvesting material uses specially-developed organic molecules to absorb certain invisible wavelengths of sunlight.

It can be tuned to pick up just the ultraviolet and the near infrared wavelengths that then ‘glow’ at another wavelength in the infrared.

The glowing infrared light is guided to the edge of the plastic where it is converted to electricity by thin strips of photovoltaic solar cells.

Because the material does not absorb or emit light in the visible spectrum, it looks transparent to the human eye and could therefore be used on next generation phone screens and windows.

‘It makes for a very colourful environment, like working in a disco. We take an approach where we actually make the luminescent active layer itself transparent.’

His solar harvesting material does this by using specially-developed organic molecules to absorb certain invisible wavelengths of sunlight.

‘We can tune these materials to pick up just the ultraviolet and the near infrared wavelengths that then “glow” at another wavelength in the infrared,’ he said.

Professor Lunt explained: ‘Because the materials do not absorb or emit light in the visible spectrum, they look exceptionally transparent to the human eye.’

He believes that the technology has the potential to be scaled so it could be used cheaply in the next generation of commercial products as well as in industries.

‘It opens a lot of area to deploy solar energy in a non-intrusive way,’ he said.

This means that solar panels could look just like windows in houses of the future, instead of being displayed on roof tops (stock image)

‘It can be used on tall buildings with lots of windows or any kind of mobile device that demands high aesthetic quality like a phone or e-reader.

‘Ultimately we want to make solar harvesting surfaces that you do not even know are there.’

Professor Lunt said that more work is needed to improve the efficiency of the material.

It currently has a solar conversion efficiency close to 1 percent but could reach five per cent when fully developed.

The best coloured luminescent solar concentrator is around seven per cent efficient.
