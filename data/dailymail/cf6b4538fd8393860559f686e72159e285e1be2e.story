Olympiacos want free agent striker Nicklas Bendtner.

The Denmark international has been training on his own since his release from Arsenal so that he is ready to make his next move.

The Greek side are in talks with Fulham over a season loan for Kostas Mitroglou and they want to team him with Bendtner in a new-look strike partnership.
