The Ku Klux Klan has been handing out Uncle Sam’-style leaflets and, for unknown reasons, rocks, in an attempt to increase their ranks.

The hate-group’s recent recruitment drive has hit several U.S. states, including Texas, Louisiana and Pennsylvania.

Residents in one town near Dallas found plastic bags hung on their doors containing the recruitment leaflet and a small rock.

Hate preach: Residents in several states across the U.S. received these KKK recruitment posters

Residents in several towns across America found that leaflets from the KKK had been attached to their doors, cars and homes.

In Rhome, near Dallas, Texas, the flier had been placed inside a plastic bag along with a small stone, and hung on residents' front doors.

'I was repulsed,' Sally Fowler told Khou.com.

'It's offensive; it's shocking. You don’t want that stuff in your neighborhood.'

The local Sheriff’s Office said they have not seen anything like this since the 1990s and although the practice is not illegal, the fliers are a cause for concern.

Disgrace: Some posters were looking for new members, while others simply had a warning message that the Ku Klux Klan was watching in their neighbourhood

I want YOU: The leaflets are similar to the classic U.S. Army recruitment poster featuring Uncle Sam

'You wish it was something from the past, that you’d hope everyone had gotten beyond that,' Sheriff's Office spokesman Capt. Kevin Benton told the newspaper.

'We do not need that type of problem in Wise County, Texas.'

The leaflets are similar to the classic
 U.S. Army recruitment poster, and reads ‘The KKK wants you,’ with a 
hooded and robed man pointing at the reader.

The
 KKK visited a predominantly black neighbourhood in Eunice, Louisiana 
this weekend dropping flyers reading: ‘Neighbourhood Watch!!! The law 
abiding citizens of your community can sleep in peace knowing the Klan 
is awake! The KKK wants you.’

The flyer also offered a ‘Loyal White Knights 24/7 hotlines,’ Nola.com said.

The Ku Klux Klan, also known as KKK or the Klan is an extremist white supremacy organization which first emerged in the Southern United States in the mid-19th century.

The Klan saw a second wave in the 1920s, during which it had an estimated three to six million members, and a third after World War II in response to the civil rights movement.

The KKK is now diminished and only has a few thousand members, who still wear the distinctive uniforms, and part-take in traditional hate-ceremonies.

Attempts made to contact the Ku Klux Klan on the given phone number have been unsuccessful.
