Susan Patton, better known as the Princeton Mom, is coming out against a plan to teach children about rape and molestation in schools, claiming reports of sexual assault are exaggerated and most can be chalked up to 'bad manners'.

Appearing on Fox & Friends with host Elisabeth Hasselbeck, Patton said that sexual education has no place in schools and should be taught at home.

Then, when presented with a statistic from the Center of Disease Control that stated 42.2 percent of rape victims were younger than 18, she asked, 'Is that rape?'

She continued by saying; 'I think the numbers that have been thrown around as to the frequency with which rape and sexual assault occurs have come into question, and have been debunked in a of number platforms.'

Patton then added; 'I think it’s a huge exaggeration, a reckless exaggeration of what actual rape statistics are or what actual sexual assault statistics are.'

This all came in response to a measure in California that aims to begin teaching children about rape, molestation and acceptable sexual behavior beginning as early as Kindergarten.

Patton however does not think that rape is the issue with these individuals, but rather bullying, and the idea of people not keeping their hands to themselves, which she believes is being reported as rape.

'And just like I don’t think sex ed belongs in school, we shouldn’t be teaching sex ed in school, that’s something parents should be teaching their children - manners, which is really what we’re talking about here,' she said. 

'Keep your hands to yourself, don’t be bullying anybody, you don’t touch somebody, you don’t want them to touch you, you tell them not to. Again, this is manners, this isn’t sex ed. And even that should be taught at home.'

This after just last month Patton said that most reports of rape on college campuses are just the result of 'clumsy hook-up melodrama.'
