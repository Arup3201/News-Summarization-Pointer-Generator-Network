A six-year-old girl has launched a petition to clear Times Square of characters that charge New Yorkers for cuddles.

According to Kamila Filshtinskiy: 'Hugs should not cost money!'.

To combat the crisis, she plans to raise funds to buy costumes so she and her friends can swarm the tourist hot spot hugging people for free.

Change: The Brooklyn-based schoolgirl wants a change of attitude in Times Square this Christmas

Her mission comes after numerous failed bids by the local government and police force to crack down on reported cases of aggression in the tourist hot spot.

On the crowdfunding site Indiegogo, the Brooklyn-based elementary school pupil writes: 'When children see Elmo, Minnie and Princesses, they want to hug them, tell them that they love 'em, and take pictures with them. 

'But they (characters) tell parents to give them a lot of money, and if children or their parents don't, they (Elmo & others) become mean and don't want to take pictures.

'It makes me sad, and it makes other children sad. Princesses and superheroes should not make children feel sad!'

She said she wants a change of attitude in Midtown by Christmas. 

Her father Mikhail told the New York Post she said: 'Daddy can you please change the world? Can you make it so Elmo doesn't charge kids to take pictures with him?'

Since November 22, she has raised more than $330.

'Makes children sad': She said panhandlers harassing parents for money makes their children upset

Gaining momentum: Since November 22, the elementary school pupil has raised more than $330 

The bid comes amid an ongoing crackdown dubbed Operation Sesame Street targeting costumed panhandlers.

In September, an Elmo character looking for tourists to pose for pictures with in Times Square  ended up in handcuffs.

Rosa Sanchez, 36, from Clifton, New Jersey, was taken into custody for allegedly demanding tips in an aggressive manner from passersby while dressed in an Elmo costume.

Arresting officers who were part of an undercover sting operation restrained the woman's hands behind her back and took a picture of her fuzzy red costume with the caption: 'Iust another day in Midtown south. Elmo arrested in Times Square.'

Ms Sanchez was then taken to Midtown South Police Precinct to be charged for aggressive solicitation.

The New York Post reported that the 36-year-old was arrested after 10 police officers posing as tourists took pictures with her.

Sanchez allegedly became irate when one of the plainclothes cops gave her a small tip. 

Most famously, a man named Daniel Sandler was arrested in 2012 for spewing anti-Semitic slurs while dressed as Elmo in Midtown Manhattan.

As recently as July, a man dressed as Spider-Man was charged with punching a police officer who intervened in a tipping dispute with a tourist.

Shady characters: The NYPD has been cracking down on costumed characters prowling the streets of Manhattan looking for tips

Three more men dressed as Spider-Man, Iron Man and Elmo were arrested that same weekend and charged with disorderly conduct for obstructing pedestrian traffic.

Last month, police spent hours handing out bright red fliers in Times Square warning tourists that photos with costumed characters are free, and tipping is optional.

Some of the mostly Spanish-speaking immigrants who wear the giant costumes lamented that the police crackdown has left them with far less to feed their families.

The City Council is currently working on a bill to require licensing for characters in the hopes of putting 'bad players' out of business.
