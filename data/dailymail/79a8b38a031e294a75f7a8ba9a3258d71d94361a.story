When word reached Robert Snodgrass that Andrew Robertson was about to raise the Scottish quota at Hull City this summer, he immediately cast himself in the role of protective big brother.

As a 21-year-old, Snodgrass had felt the weight of the world on his shoulders when he moved from Livingston to Leeds in 2008. His fellow Scot, he sincerely believed, would need all the free advice going as he embarked on life in the Premier League.

Ten weeks on from extending a welcoming handshake to the former Dundee United full-back at the KC Stadium, Snodgrass’ fears for Robertson have long since evaporated.

To say the player has taken to the task like a duck to water is to do him a huge disservice. The same goes for his ascent to the Scotland team.

From playing with Queen’s Park at Hampden to eyeing Georgia at Ibrox in a Scotland shirt in little over a year, Robertson’s story would normally be reserved for the pages of a child’s comic.

As for the surrogate big brother, fulsome praise has long since replaced those early words of advice.

‘He’s a very level-headed lad,’ Snodgrass said. ‘As he’s Scottish, you feel it’s your duty when he comes down to make sure he’s okay.

‘There’s only so much you can do but he’s dealt with everything Steve Bruce has thrown at him - some big tests. You always hear about whether someone can cut it at the top. Well the only way to find out is to give them a chance. The manager has done that so fair play to him and fair play to Robbo for taking it.

‘When Andy did come down, the first thing I told him was to believe that he could cut it there. You go in there with no fear like he did, and show people what you can do. He’s got a great left foot and the way he attacks is terrific. He’s learning each day and that’s good. He’s in the gym working hard on his upper body and physique.

‘It can only be good for Scotland when lads like that come through. He’s got a big future ahead of him. You see him on TV and he stands out straight away. Some lads are shell-shocked by the occasion and that’s one thing he’s not. He’s been terrific.”

A serious knee injury sustained on his Hull debut means Snodgrass can do no more than roar himself hoarse at Ibrox this evening.

If the mental anguish at being excluded from the opening four games of the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign has been comparable with the physical pain of dislocating his knee at Loftus Road, the 27-year-old has taken considerable comfort in the way Gordon Strachan and his players have dealt with his misfortune.

‘Every one of the lads in the squad has wished me all the best since my injury,’ he added. ‘Most of them have been through something similar and the manager has also been on the phone, trying to get me to the team hotel and to sit in on the meetings.

‘That shows the character of the man. He wants us all to feel part of it and I take my hat off to him.

‘It feels like a club whenever we meet up and that bodes well for the future. We might only meet five or six times each year but we’ve kept the core of the squad together, with just a few additions here and there.

‘The manager has worked to get that spirit and whenever anyone new comes into the group he’s the first one to make sure that they’re involved.

‘He tells them: “Listen, you need to be part of this because we’ve got something going here so get in there and start bonding” — and that’s what happens.’

It could be said that Strachan owes Snodgrass more than any other. It was, after all, his winning goal in Zagreb a year past in June that began to turn the tanker around.

The subsequent progress made has meant the tangible feeling of optimism ahead of the match this evening now has a sound grounding in reality.

Reflecting on that night in Croatia, Snodgrass said: ‘I don’t know if that was just the crazy Jock mentality or whether it was down to the feel-good factor and the confidence that the gaffer has bred in us all. That patriotic thing comes out and you think: “We can do this”.

‘It’s like Manchester United players coming out and saying that they used to beat opposing teams in the tunnel because they could see the fear in their faces.

‘When you have the belief that we have now then you give yourself a better chance of winning games.

‘So many times over the years you must have sat and interviewed Scotland players and thought: “This is the same old story here”.

‘But now I’m sure you’re thinking that this is our time, that you can see signs that we’re making progress here.’

The epitome of Strachan’s ‘one for all and all for one’ doctrine, Snodgrass typically parks his personal difficulties to talk up his belief in those who will face Georgia tonight.

But there’s no escaping that it’s been hard. Extremely hard. For a player who hardly knew what a day without training or a week without a game was, the first serious injury of his career felt like someone switching off a light.

‘It’s quite difficult not being part of things,’ he admitted.

‘There’s no better feeling when you cross that white line, that childhood feeling comes out in you that you’re playing football.

‘For that 90 minutes you’re free, you do what you do and that’s what you’ve worked all week for. That side of things I am missing.

‘I’ll be honest, it’s been tough. But I’ll approach it each day at a time. I haven’t had big injuries, this is the first one.

‘It’s been really hard especially when you’ve got family and such. It affects everything. Anyone living with a footballer will tell you it’s difficult because one thing can set you over the edge.

‘Down there they’ve got a lot of psychologists which is really good because you can speak to people and talk to them.

‘I’ve seen many players come out saying through injuries they’ve hit depression. I don’t want that for me.

‘That’s why I’m focusing on things, being the best person I can be and trying to give everything each day in my recovery.’
