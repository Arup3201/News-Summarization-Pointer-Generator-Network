Bobby Brown's wife is expecting their second child together - as his daughter Bobbi Kristina continues to fight for her life.

The R&B star's wife Alicia Etheredge is four months pregnant, according to TMZ, and they have been telling relatives in recent days.

But the happy news comes as Brown's 21-year-old daughter with Whitney Houston remains in a medically-induced coma at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia.

On Wednesday, Brown, 46, and Etheredge, 41, were joined by his daughter LaPrincia as they headed to Bobbi Kristina Brown's bedside, four days after she was found face down in a bathtub.

The couple, who married in June 2012, stayed largely silent as they walked to the hospital.

They already have one son together, five-year-old Cassius, and Brown has four other children from previous relationships: Landon, 28; LaPrincia, 24; Bobby Jr., 22' and Bobbi Kristina.

Bobbi Kristina was found unconscious in her bathtub at her Roswell, Georgia on Saturday by her purported husband, Nick Gordon - nearly three years after her mother, Whitney Houston, died after being found in eerily similar circumstances.

According to reports, Brown has been told that there is little hope his daughter will pull through.

'It's now a matter of when the family wants to let go and accept that she's pretty much not going to make it,' a source told FOX411. 'They've left it up to the family as to how long they want to keep her alive.' 

During tests for brain activity, she briefly opened her eyes and doctors have found 'minimal' improvement in her brain function, TMZ reported earlier this week. 

Her father is reported to be remaining hopeful and is refusing to acknowledge the worst-case scenario.

On Wednesday, it emerged that police are looking into the possibility that eye-witnesses may have fled the scene after Bobbi Kristina was found on Saturday morning.

Police said Gordon attempted to revive her while a friend called 911, and that she was alive when taken to hospital. Gordon's friend, Max Lomas, has since claimed he was the one who rushed to her aid.

Now Roswell Police Detectives are investigating whether people fled before officers arrived and have been asking local businesses if they saw anything suspicious that morning, E! News reported.

Nearby bank employees told detectives they saw nothing but police have requested surveillance footage, sources told the website. 

Questions still remain over what part drugs - if any - played in Saturday's incident; police reportedly found narcotics in the home during a second search last weekend.

Bobby Brown has had his own share of drug troubles, including how he admitted to using 'an awful lot' of cocaine after marrying Whitney Houston in 1992. 

Among his multiple arrests, he was nabbed in 2012 for DUI and completed a stint in rehab in August of that year for alcohol addiction - before being arrested for another DUI just three months later.

In 2013, he served just nine hours behind bars after pleading no contest to suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol.

On Tuesday, Brown spoke out again through his lawyer to correct reports that his daughter had married Gordon.

Following Houston's death three years ago, Bobbi entered into a relationship with Gordon - a sort-of surrogate brother after her mother welcomed him into their home when he was 12.

Then last January the couple announced that they had got married, and Bobbi Kristina posted photos of their 'wedding rings' on social media.

But on Tuesday a lawyer representing Bobbi's father released the following statement: 'We are currently investigating the events that led to the hospitalization of Bobbi Kristina.'

'To correct earlier reports, Bobbi Kristina is not and has never been married to Nick Gordon,' added Christopher Brown of Brown & Rosen LLC.

Relations between Gordon and  other family members have been rocky and he remains subject to a protective order barring him from being within 200 feet of Bobbi Kristina's aunt, Patricia Houston.
