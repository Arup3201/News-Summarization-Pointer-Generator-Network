The Air Force has stripped 17 officers of their authority to control - and, if necessary, launch -  nuclear missiles, due to their shockingly low proficiency in operating a missile launch simulator during a routine inspection.

During a March inspection of the 91st Missile Wing at Minot Air Force Base, N.D.,
the team earned the equivalent of a 'D' grade when tested on its mastery of 
Minuteman III missile launch operations

In April, base officials quietly removed 17 officers, more than 10 per cent of the total force at Minot serving in the highly sensitive role of standing 24-hour watch over 
the Air Force's most powerful nuclear missiles, the intercontinental 
ballistic missiles that can strike targets across the globe.

Concern: The Air Force stripped 17 officers of their authority to control a nuclear missiles, after their poor performance during an inspection (Officers simulate launching a Minuteman III ICBM in 2009 at Minot AFB)

The group's deputy commander said it is suffering 'rot' within its ranks.

'We are, in fact, in a crisis right 
now,' the commander, Lt. Col. Jay Folds, wrote in an internal email 
obtained by The Associated Press and confirmed by the Air Force.

Folds is deputy commander of the 91st 
Operations Group, whose three squadrons are responsible for manning the 
wing's 15 Minuteman III launch control centers. 

The wing has 150 officers assigned to missile launch control duty.

The U.S. Force has an estimated 450 
Minuteman-III missiles stored at missile silos around three bases - F.E.
Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming, Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana 
and Minot.

The email describes a culture of indifference, with at least one intentional violation of 
missile safety rules and an apparent unwillingness among some to 
challenge or report those who violate rules.

Folds also complained about 
unwarranted questioning of orders from superior officers by launch crews
and failure to address superiors with the proper respect.

Security: The disciplined officers showed a lack of knowledge in operating a missile launch simulator and compromised the security of launch codes (pictured in 2010, airmen at Minot AFB)

Possible 
disciplinary action is pending against one other officer at Minot, who had purposefully broken a missile safety rule in an 
unspecified act that could have compromised the secret codes that enable
the launching of missiles, which stand on high alert in underground 
silos in the nation's midsection.

Officials said there was no compromise
of missile safety or security.

Advising his troops on April 12 that they had 'fallen,' Folds wrote that drastic corrective action was required because 'we didn't wake up' after an underwhelming inspection in March.

'Now we're discovering such rot in the crew force that your behavior while on alert is accepting of' weapons safety rule violations, possible code compromises and other failings, 'all in the name of not inconveniencing yourselves,' Folds wrote.

'We are breaking you down, and we will build from the ground up,' Folds added.

Folds' superiors, Col. Robert Vercher, commander of the 91st Missile Wing, said inspectors rated officers proficiency in operating the missile launch simulator 
and responses to written questions about procedures.

Their performance 
was rated 'marginal,' which Vercher said is the equivalent of a 'D' 
grade.

'Nobody is comfortable with that,' Vercher said.

Evaluation: Inspectors rated the officers during an evaluation of the 91st Missile Wing at Minot Air Force Base, N.D. (Two commanders stand on the platform at a missile silo in S.D. in Nov. 1964)

The trouble at Minot is the latest in a
series of setbacks for the Air Force's nuclear mission, highlighted by a
2008 Pentagon advisory group report that found a 'dramatic and 
unacceptable decline' in the Air Force's commitment to the mission, 
which has its origins in a Cold War standoff with the former Soviet 
Union.

In 2008, then-Defense Secretary Robert
Gates sacked the top civilian and military leaders of the Air Force 
after a series of blunders, including the stunning mistake in a August 2007 incident in which an Air Force B-52 bomber flew from Minot to Barksdale Air Force Base, La., without the crew realizing it was armed with six nuclear-tipped cruise missiles.

One outcome of the incident was the creation of Global Strike Command in January 2009 as a way of improving management of the nuclear enterprise.

Bruce Blair, who served as an Air Force ICBM launch control officer in the 1970s and is now a research scholar at Princeton University, said the Folds email points to a broader problem within the nuclear weapons force.

'The nuclear air force is suffering from a deep malaise caused by the declining relevance of their mission since the Cold War's end over 20 years ago,' Blair said in an interview.

'Minuteman launch crews have long been marginalized and demoralized by the fact that the Air Force's culture and fast-track careers revolve around flying planes, not sitting in underground bunkers baby-sitting nuclear-armed missiles.'

Blair is co-founder of Global Zero, an international group that advocates the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons.
