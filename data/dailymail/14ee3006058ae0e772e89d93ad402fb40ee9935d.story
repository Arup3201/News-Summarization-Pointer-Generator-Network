Bored: David Watson, 74, admitted making images of Kym Marsh, Jennie McAlpine and Natalie Robb

A 'bored pensioner' is facing prison for superimposing the heads of Coronation Street stars onto the bodies of naked women.

David Watson, 74, created the images of Kym Marsh, Jennie McAlpine and Emmerdale actress Natalie Robb at his house in Daventry, Northampton, before sending them to the stars' home addresses.

The photographs left the women 'shocked and sickened', and prompted Miss McAlpine to increase security at her home for fear of attack.

Watson now faces prison after pleading guilty to two counts of sending indecent images to Miss McAlpine, who plays Fiz Stape in Coronation Street, between October and December 2013.

Under the Malicious Communications Act, he also pleaded guilty to two charges of sending indecent messages to Miss Marsh, who plays Michelle Connor in the soap, and Miss Robb, who plays Moira Barton in Emmerdale, for the purpose of causing them distress and anxiety.

Prosecutor Matthew Treece told Manchester Magistrates Court that Miss Marsh was the first victim on October 18.

She received a handwritten envelope marked 'personal' and asked her father to open the letter.

It contained a picture that had been edited to include an image of Miss Marsh’s face on the body of a different woman exposing her breasts.

Five days later Miss McAlpine got a similar letter with an explicit message on the photo. 

The court heard on November 2 a third
 letter with a picture was received by Miss Robb. It was her face on the
 body of another woman showing her breasts. Miss McAlpine then received a
 second letter containing the same image as the first.

Admission: Pensioner David Watson now faces prison after pleading guilty to sending indecent images to the home addresses of actresses Kym Marsh (left) Jennie McAlpine (right)

Upset: Kym Marsh, who plays Michelle Connor in Coronation Street, said she had been left 'shocked and sickened' by the images

Worried: The photographs prompted Jennie McAlpine, who plays Fiz Stape in the soap, to increase security at her home for fear of attack

This time the pensioner wrote 'Jenny, I would love to see you like this' followed by an explicit message and kisses.

Mr Treece said: 'Watson showed a lot of determination to get the addresses of the actresses and it was aggravated by the way he used the photos.'

The court heard how he had got the addresses through an internet company who had supplied them for a fee. But this turned out to be his undoing as police later contacted the company he had used to track him down.

On arrest Watson claimed he had sent the letters out of boredom.

At first he told police he had got the 
images of the naked actresses and had not altered them. But he later 
admitted what he had done, said Mr Treece.

Concerns: Emmerdale star Natalie Robb said she felt degraded by the photographs. 'It had crossed my mind I may have a stalker', she said in a statement to the court

Victims: David Watson, 74, created the images of Kym Marsh (right) and Jennie McAlpine (left) at his home in Daventry, Northampton. He claimed to have made them out of 'boredom'

In her impact statement Miss McAlpine said the letters had left her feeling scared.

She said: 'I have improved the security at my home with additional locks... It was degrading.”'

Miss Robb said she had also felt degraded. 'It had crossed my mind I may have a stalker', she added.

In her statement Miss Marsh said the incident had left her 'feeling sick and shocked'.

James Street, defending, said Watson had never previously been in trouble.

He added: 'He said he’d been bored but I think there is something more behind this. Something has been going on.'

The magistrates bailed Watson for an all options report including custody. He will be sentenced on March 12.
