We spend hundreds or thousands of pounds on holidays that whisk us away from  'everyday life' to far-off places that provide the ultimate escape.

But one designer believes people can find that escape with a unique - and cheaper - experience that allows them to fall in love again with the landscape that is around them every day.

Goetz Schrader's proposed '15-Minute Vacations' would be carried out on an extendable balcony that lifts visitors some 30ft into the air for an alternative view.

The German designer believes seeing the sights from a different vantage point can eliminate the need to travel abroad

The 36-year-old German's concept creates temporary instruments for a holiday without the need to travel.

Speaking to MailOnline Travel, Mr Schrader said: 'We spend more and more time working - at the same time the affordable space for living, and therefore relaxation is decreasing.

'Europeans tend to travel overseas whenever they get the time without even knowing their own country. 

'This concept aims to help you see your own area or town from a different perspective.'

The platform situated at the top of the lifting mechanism can be designed to the operator's specifications

Within a few seconds the machine converts the familiar environment into a new experience for 15 minutes.

The location is not fixed - but cities like London and New York are the target group since private space in those cities is limited and potential holiday spots can be far out of town.

'For just a short time, perhaps in your lunch break, you create a new and exciting situation by just shifting the perspective,' added Mr Schrader.

People in cities such as London and New York are considered the target group, as their personal space is 'limited'

The German anticipates the platforms will be hired locally, and the furniture on top can include dining areas and gardens, which will be owned by the city or private operator.

Prices will vary from city to city, and will be dependent on the type of platform chosen, and what facilities are on offer, he added.

Mr Schrader was born in Dusseldorf, Germany in 1978, and went on to study at University College London, as well as institutions in Vienna, Halifax, Canada and in his hometown. He has worked in London, Los Angeles and Dusseldorf.
