A high school teacher has been sentenced to 30 months probation after having sex with a student.

Amber Kraus, 30, worked at Grant Community High School near Fox Lake, Chicago, until last October, when allegations of the sexual assault began to surface.

She pleaded guilty to aggravated criminal sexual abuse but could have faced a sentence of three to seven years in prison if convicted at trial.

She had taught at the school for eight years.

Teacher: Amber Kraus resigned from her job amid allegations of inappropriate contact with a student and has been charged with sexual assault

Kraus initially pleaded not guilty to one count of criminal sexual assault and two counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse.

Such charges would imply that Kraus used force or deception.

Ultimately, the former science teacher admitted to having 'some sexual contact with the teen' but not sexual intercourse.

The victim, who is aged between 13 and 17, told police the two exchanged inappropriate photos of each other and had sexual intercourse at Kraus' Grayslake apartment.

In
 a letter to parents, school administrators called the case an 'isolated
 incident that occurred away from campus and involved no other 
students',

Kraus must now make a $500 donation to the
 Lake County Child Advocacy Center, perform 150 hours of community 
service and complete any sex offender treatment or other probation 
services deemed necessary by the court’s Sex Offender Unit.

School: Amber Kraus resigned in October from her job as a science teacher at Grant Community High School near Fox Lake but the alleged sex is said to have taken place in her home

Grant High School learned of the incident and  
contacted the police in October after the victim reported details of the incident to police.

Kraus,
 who has been free on a $100,000 bond since her arrest, made 
no comments in court.

Kraus
 had resigned her position at the school in October. Grant High School 
sent out a press release after Kraus’s arrest stating that police 
immediately were contacted when school officials learned of the 
allegations, and the incident appeared to have been isolated.
