Veteran Las Vegas showman Wayne Newton's 65-foot yacht has sunk mysteriously 80 miles east of Las Vegas.

Authorities are investigating how the yacht sank as it was docked at Lake Mead.

National Park Service spokeswoman Christie Vanover said Monday that the 65-foot vessel sank stern-first in 45 feet of water while it was in a slip at the Temple Bar marina.

That's on the Arizona side of the Colorado River reservoir, about 80 miles east of Las Vegas.

Vanover says no one was on the boat, and no injuries are reported.

Newton's sister-in-law, Tricia McCrone, confirms that the 1996 Skipperliner named Rendezvous belongs to Newton.

McCrone says Newton and his wife Kathleen were vacationing out of the country when the boat sank Friday.

According to the Las Vegas Sun, some kind of equipment failure caused the yacht to take on water and sink within minutes.

Lake Havasu City Vessel Assist will salvage the boat later this week, Vanover said.

A photo provided by the Park Service shows the boat's bow sticking straight up from the water.

Wayne Newon is one of the best-known entertainers in Las Vegas and is known variously as Mr Las Vegas, The Midnight Idol and Mr Entertainment.

He's best-known for his signature tune, Danke Schoen, which was released in 1963.
