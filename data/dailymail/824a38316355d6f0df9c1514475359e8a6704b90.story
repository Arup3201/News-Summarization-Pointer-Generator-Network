In light of recent events in Connecticuit and the rumbling debate over gun laws in America, one runway show left the audience of Milan Fashion Week open-mouthed.

German designer Philipp Plein's startling Autumn-Winter 2013 menswear collection previewed in Milan on Monday.

And the designer chose to feature models carrying automatic weapons, wearing balaclavas, and sporting red-inked words such as 'ONLY KILL FOR LOVE' on their topless torsos.

Marching down a runway paved with sandbags, the male models were dressed in ripped jeans, dark clothes, stern lines and army trenchcoats.

Their faces and bodies were covered in tattoos, warpaint and capitalised slogans in red ink such as 'ONLY KILL FOR REAL LOVE' and 'LIFE'S A GAME AND IT'S NOT FAIR'.

The men waved machine guns in the direction of the audience, and they in turn wielded camera phones, determined to catch the controversial event on film.

One man even carried a teddy bear made of chain mail.

The tattooed designer himself emerged at the end of the show wearing a tight military green T-shirt, dog-tags, army boot and military-inspired trousers.
