Guilty plea: Labour MP Eric Joyce arrives at Westminster Magistrates Court yesterday

A Labour MP who head-butted fellow politicians in a House of Commons bar brawl was spared jail yesterday.

Eric Joyce, 51, threw punches and 'nutted' two Conservatives after a late-night drinking session, snarling: 'There are too many ******* Tories in here.'

Witnesses said the glazed eyes of the former Army major, who had to be restrained by eight police officers, made it 'look like nobody was home'.

As the officers dragged him to the cells, Joyce yelled: 'You can't touch me, I am an MP.'

Details of the extraordinary incident were revealed for the first time yesterday, as the Falkirk MP admitted carrying out the assault at Westminster Magistrates Court.

Joyce now faces expulsion from the Labour Party, but vowed to continue serving as an independent.

The brawl broke out in the Commons Strangers' Bar, which is reserved for MPs and their guests, at about 10.30pm on February 22. One of Joyce's friends, Stuart Niven – an amateur opera singer – started to sing loudly, provoking startled glances from a neighbouring table of Conservatives.

Joyce, who had drunk a bottle of red wine, stood to warn Tory MP Alec Shelbrooke: 'Don't ever look at my guests in that way again'.

When another Conservative MP, Andrew Percy, asked him to sit down, Joyce shoved him up against the wall, shouting: 'This bar is full of ******* Tories.'

When Mr Shelbrooke said: 'You can't treat an MP like that in a place like this,' Joyce swung for the Tory, who ducked the blow. Joyce then punched Conservative councillor Luke Mackenzie, splitting his lip, before head-butting another, Ben Maney.

Labour whip Phillip Wilson then put a hand on Joyce's shoulder and said: 'Calm down Eric – what's going on?' Joyce responded by punching him in the face.

Police arrived to find Joyce smelling 'strongly of alcohol' with 'glazed' eyes. He continued his assault as the officers tried to restrain him, swearing at them before head-butting Tory MP Stuart Andrew, giving him a bloody nose and concussion.

Joyce, described as drunker than one 
witness 'had ever seen anyone', furiously kicked at doors as he was 
dragged away by police, breaking a glass pane as he continued to abuse 
officers.

The MP even managed to snatch a 
constable's notebook and scrawl: 'We are a Tory nation, that cannot be 
forever …good cops unite…It's surely …to hate the Tories.'

He claimed at
 Belgravia police station that someone else had started the fight, 
telling officers: 'I think he was a silly fat Tory MP. 

'He was pushing 
like a girl and giving me a bear-hug. I nutted a guy. It was a wee 
scuffly thing…If people said I was hammered, that was probably true.'

Jeremy Dein QC, defending, said his 
client had little recollection of the events as he had not eaten all day
 and had been 'working intently' since 8.30am.

'What accompanies his 
apology is an overriding sense of shame and embarrassment,' he added.

The court heard that the MP, who 
recently split from his headmistress wife Rosemary, had a previous 
conviction for refusing to give police a urine sample when he was 
stopped in his car in 2010.

Smashed window: The Strangers Bar was damaged during the fracas

Joyce, while sobering up in the cells, told police of one of his victims: 'I think he was a silly fat Tory MP. He was pushing like a girl and giving me a bearhug.'

A barman had told officers there was a 'happy and friendly' atmosphere before Joyce 'flipped' on February 22.

Prosecutor Ms Martin said: 'Mr Joyce started to sing very loudly...

'That was noticed by several people in the bar. Nobody seemed bothered by it.'

Joyce then approached Tory MP Alec Shelbrooke, saying: 'Don't look at any of my guests like that again.'

MP Andrew Percy walked past and asked Joyce to move. Joyce replied: 'No, you f****** can't', Ms Martin said.

Witnesses said Joyce then shouted: 'There are too many Tories in this bar' and later: 'The bar was full of f****** Tories.'

Mr Andrews protested, saying: 'You can't behave in that way' before Joyce launched into a string of attacks.

Mr Riddle told Joyce: 'What you have done has not only brought physical harm (and) shame on yourself...

But it has also damaged the place where you work, the place where laws are made.'

He took into account Joyce's previous conviction for drink-driving but gave the defendant credit for his early pleas.

Speaking afterwards, Joyce said he was 'deeply apologetic' for his actions.

Outside court, he said: 'Clearly it's a matter of considerable personal shame.

'I've been duly punished today. I've been lucky to avoid prison. I'm very ashamed, of course.'

He said he wanted to apologise to a 'long list' of people he had let down, including his constituents and fellow MPs.

But he said he did not intend to stand down as an MP before the next election.

'It would be easy but I was elected in 2000 and I will continue serving,' he said.

Asked if he thought he had a problem with alcohol, he said: 'I
 think drink was an aggravating factor, that's something I have to deal 
with personally. Not everyone who drinks gets involved in fights.'

Labour Party sources indicated that any decision on Joyce's future in the party would not be made until after he was sentenced.

Joyce's guilty plea does not necessarily mark an end to his career as an MP.

Under the Representation of the People Act 1981, MPs are disqualified 
from the House of Commons only if they are convicted of a criminal 
offence and sentenced to 12 months or more in jail.

Joyce has already said that he will stand down from Parliament at the next general election, expected in 2015.

Chief magistrate Howard Riddle said 
Joyce would have faced jail, with a maximum sentence of 26 weeks, had 
the matter gone to trial.

Giving credit for Joyce's early guilty
 plea to four charges of common assault, he handed him a 12-month 
community punishment instead.

Joyce was also barred from all pubs 
for three months, banned from travelling abroad unless on Parliamentary 
business, and ordered to pay a £3,000 fine and £1,400 in compensation to
 his victims.

Joyce said outside court: 'Clearly 
it's a matter of considerable personal shame. I've been duly punished 
today. I've been lucky to avoid prison. I'm very ashamed, of course.'

The MP was also given a curfew – the 
start of which was delayed by 24 hours so he could honour a promise to 
meet journalism students.

In an interview with Sam Holden at the
 University of Bedfordshire, Joyce said: 'Have I undermined my authority
 by fighting in a bar punching people? I might have done.'
