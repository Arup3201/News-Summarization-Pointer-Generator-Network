This guy admits he was 'pretty crazy', but feels better about things now.

David Cross, 42, of Salisbury, Massachusetts, intentionally crashed a ‘lemon’ van into seven parked vehicles at a car dealership, police said.

The garage in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, allegedly refused to take back the vehicle he bought one day earlier, even though it had many problems.

Charged: David Cross, 42, of Salisbury, Massachusetts, intentionally crashed a 'lemon' van into seven parked vehicles at a car dealership, police said

‘I hit the first $25,000 car I could see,’ Cross told the Portsmouth Herald.  ‘I didn't hit a car under $20,000.

‘Then I moved a van that they wouldn't come down on the price for. I moved it with the lemon they sold me.’

Cross told police he bought the car on Monday before his mechanic found a variety of problems and told him to return it to the dealer.

But Portsmouth Used Car Superstore declined to take it back and so after it closed on Tuesday he returned at midnight with the van.

Wreck: He smashed it into seven vehicles at the dealer's, including a Mercedes C300 and a Ford Mustang, causing $20,000 damage, police said

‘He damaged each one, and then he left his van that he bought behind,’ a Portsmouth police spokesman said.

Cross then went up to a police car nearby and reported the incident, leading an officer back to the wrecks.

‘It's not every day that someone comes up to you and says: “I just smashed my car into all these things”,’ a police spokesman said.

Cross was arrested and charged with seven counts of criminal mischief - which was a felony due to the damage amount, police said.

He was released on personal recognisance and scheduled to be arraigned on September 19 in Portsmouth District Court.

Cross said he was feeling ‘pretty crazy’ 'But I got my point across,' he said.
