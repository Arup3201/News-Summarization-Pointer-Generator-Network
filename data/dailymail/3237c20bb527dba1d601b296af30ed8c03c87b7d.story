The 6-year-old Alabama boy held hostage in an underground bunker last year is doing well and shows few effects from the ordeal, his brother has said during an interview.

Almost one year ago Ethan was taken from his dale county school bus and held hostage for six days in an underground bunker.

Camren Kirkland, the older brother of Ethan Gilman, said the boy has only spoken of the ordeal a few times since it ended, and he isn’t showing signs of lingering problems or stress.

Ethan Gilman: Despite the horrific situation, counselors say Ethan does not have PTSD symptoms

Brotherly love: Ethan Gilliam's brother, Camren Kirkland says he's a normal six year old boy even though he has been through some very extraordinary circumstances

One year ago: Ethan was held hostage in an underground bunker in a near week-long standoff in Midland City, Alabama. His older brother says Ethan is doing well and showing few effects from the ordeal

'He told me the whole story from the time Dykes came on to the bus till the time he took him to the bunker he told me the whole story and I just listened to him.'

'I didn't pry I just let him talk. But the best thing is he came out of it safe and sound and Ethan as a whole now has made a lot of strides from the kid before he went in,' he said.

‘He doesn’t mention it much, and I don’t pry him for information. He's probably only talked about it four times.'

Now their conversations revolve around normal brother stuff like school and playing baseball.

He's my brother: Camren Kirkland says everything opened my eyes up to a whole new meaning of life itself. I felt very fortunate for the events that happened in the end

Back of his mind: Ethan has only spoken of his ordeal about four times. These days he'd much rather chat about school or the presents he got for his birthday

Changed for the better: Ethan lived with his mother and grandmother before the standoff, but Kirkland, who described himself as 17 years older than Ethan, said the boy now lives with him

Held for a week: The 6-year-old Alabama boy held hostage in an underground bunker last year is doing well and shows few effects

Normal: Ethan is growing up to be a bubbly well-rounded little boy

Gilliam, who is currently a 6-year-old
 kindergarten student, was enthusiastic when he was describing his 
favorite toys -- Transformers, a dart gun and RC cars, specifically his 
blue one.

He was having 
problems academically and behaviorally before the standoff, which 
occurred in Dale County near Midland City. Kirkland said his brother now
 gets far more good reports from teachers than bad ones.

‘Ethan as a whole has made a lot of strides from where he was before,’ said Kirkland.

When
 asked about his trip to Disney World, Ethan's face lit up before 
talking about his favorite ride at the theme park -- a roller coaster 
that twisted and turned sideways.

'It scared me a little bit,' Ethan said before going on to talk about his day at school, where he made a snowman.

His favorite part about school? The slide on the playground.

A
 little less than 15 minutes into the sit-down, Ethan removed the 
collection of mics from his shirt and got up from the couch, leaving the
 rest of the questions to his brother, who said the hostage crisis gave 
him a renewed sense of perspective on life in general.

Dead: Jimmy Lee Dykes was killed by members of the FBI's elite Hostage Rescue Team after they blew open the doors of his bunker and went inside

'Life has changed a whole lot for me,'
 Camren said. 'Everything opened my eyes up to a whole new meaning of 
life itself. I felt very fortunate for the events that happened in the 
end.'

Ethan's counselors 
were once worried that he would have PTSD but it has been confirmed that
 he has no signs of that at all but as Ethan and his family continue to 
heal, there are some memories that his brother Camren says will never 
fade.

'I remember the six 
days we sat and waited for the news. The FBI gathered us and told us 
that she had some news that they stormed the bunker and got him... It 
was all just tears of joy… happiness,' said Camren.

Jimmy Lee Dykes, 65, held Ethan 
hostage for six days last January and February after boarding the boy’s 
school bus, fatally shooting driver Charles Poland and dragging Ethan 
into the bunker.

After a standoff of nearly a week, officers rescued the child unharmed after storming the bunker and killing Dykes.

Ethan lived with his mother and 
grandmother before the standoff, but Kirkland, who described himself as 
17 years older than Ethan, said the boy now lives with him.

‘I treat him more like a son than I do a brother,’ Camren said.

He says throughout the last year the support and love Ethan's been shown is remarkable.

Along
 with the national attention came hundreds of gifts, cards and letters. 
Camren has put up those mementos for when Ethan is older and can 
understand what they mean.

Ethan
 wants to be a race car driver or an airplane mechanic when he grows up,
 his big brother said, ‘and I’m going to do everything I can to help 
him.’

Camren says he wants Ethan to graduate high school and go to college.

Camren said he and the boy will attend a memorial being planned at Dale County High School in memory of Poland, the bus driver.

A dramatic gunfight ensued in the rescue in which Dykes, who fired
 the first shot, was killed. Ethan was physically unharmed during the ordeal.

Captive: The site where Ethan was held hostage in an underground bunker

The bunker where Jimmy Lee Dykes held Ethan hostage for seven days. Police used the PVC pipe to communicate with Dykes, who was three feet underground

Authorities
 have since revealed that they executed their meticulous plan to free 
Ethan. They have said their operation was conducted with 
military precision after learning the underground bunker was rigged with
 explosives which they believed Dykes was preparing to detonate.

The
 agents inserted a spy camera into the lair then blew the doors off the bunker.

Agents
 had become increasingly concerned the 65-year-old's behavior would turn
 violent after their negotiations with him 'deteriorated' in the final 
24 hours.

FBI Special Agent Steve Richardson said: 'Dykes was observed holding a gun.

'At this point, the FBI agents, fearing the child was in imminent danger, entered the bunker and rescued the child.'

On the one year anniversary, it would appear their training, planning and all round good-luck paid of for everyone involved.
