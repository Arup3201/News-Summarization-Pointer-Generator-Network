Does your cat have an irritating habit of disappearing just when you want to go to bed? Does your dog do a bunk every time you let him off the lead?

According to pet astrologer Fiona Celeste, from Glasgow, it's not because they don't like you - it's because their wandering ways are written in the stars.

Celeste, the UK’s only professional astrologer for cats and dogs, says it is understandable that owners become upset when beloved pets disappear, but argues it is a case of nature over nurture.

Important: Fiona says that astrology can help you to better understand the family pets

The 55-year-old mystic and mother of three, said: 'It can be in an animal’s nature to explore. The position of the planets when a pet was born really influences their characteristics.

'Some are always going to be very adventurous, others are naturally incredibly homely. For example, Aries pets are very impulsive and like to assert their control.

'It’s especially important to keep these dogs on a lead to guard against their nature, and stop them making a run for it.'

Pet owners who haven't quite managed to pull of the trick include Strictly Come Dancing star Abbey Crouch who was devastated when her long-haired tabby cat, Maggie, went missing from her London home last August.

Luckily for Crouch, she and her pet were reunited a week later, after the 27-year-old launched an appeal on Twitter.

Other celebrities have also taken to Twitter with appeals to find their missing pets, including Emma Bunton whose chocolate Labrador Phoebe ran off during a walk in February.

'Gemini pets are incredibly fast moving and love meeting other people and animals, so could also be quite prone to zipping off down the street for a while,' adds Celeste.

'By contrast, Taurean pets are usually much slower and have a very placid nature so don’t tend to go missing so much.

'If your pet is a Cancer, they’ll be a homebird too. They like to have their home comforts nearby. You can really unlock a lot about your dog or cat’s personality by looking to the skies when they were born.'If your pet does make a bid for freedom,
Celeste says that making the most of astrological know-how can help to 
bring them home.

Insight: According to Fiona, astrology can help shed light on your pet's character - and stop it from wandering

'Most pets are likely to find their own way home sooner or later, but there can be things you can do to help,' she explains.

'For example, you should never scold a
Leo pet. They have big egos and it would break their heart. So if 
you’re out hunting for a missing Leo make sure you don’t sound too 
cross.

'Geminis are known for being very vocal. So if a Gemini has gone off on an adventure keep an ear out to track them down.

'And
with an Aries, it’s especially important to show them who’s boss. Take 
them to puppy training classes to make sure they know your commands if 
they do ever try to disappear on an adventure.'

She added: 'When I see missing pet 
posters in the street I often wonder what sign the animal is. 
Fortunately Pippa, my Maltese Terrier, has never made a run for it.'

Celeste
says her keen interest in the zodiac is the legacy of her mother, 
Alice, who would regularly remark on how people’s personalities were 
influenced by their star sign.

'She
would even do the same for our pets,' remembers Celeste. 'Our lovely 
little Yorkie Heather was, in my mum’s words, a typical Sagittarius.

Clients: Most of Fiona's work involves cats like Coco Styles (pictured) whose horoscope can be found below

Fiona says: 'Coco's an explorer. She loves playing and chasing, and she's very curious. It's probably a good idea to keep her stocked up with toys to keep her entertained. 

'As an Aries, Coco needs to feel as if she's number one at at all times. She likes being in charge, which allows her to act on impulse. She's likely to behave mischievously if she doesn't get her way. 

'She's definitely a loveable rogue and extremely active. She's intrepid, and likes to experience new things. She's usually the first to initiate play. 

'The name Coco suits her personality. She's a born entertainer and loves to see people smiling. 

'It's likely that she'll want to satisfy her curiosity with the occasional adventure. She's the daredevil of cats at heart.

'She has the moon, the sun and the Venus of Aries. She needs adventure for her emotional, spiritual and physical wellbeing.

'Her Mars is in Sagittarius which, like Aries, is also a fire sign. This suggests she has a fiery personality and prone to act on impulse.'

Owner's verdict: 'I'm impressed that Fiona has got so much spot on, particularly her love of people and her liking for getting out and about.

'She is an old cat though, so she's doing it a lot less than she used to and is confining her adventures to the house!'

'Heather had bags of confidence and loved her freedom, and I grew up believing my mum really did have a point.'

But it was only after giving up her career as an air stewardess to have her children Chris, 18, Jen, 17, and Bob, 14, that Celeste found the time to truly indulge her passion.

Initially she focused on reading horoscopes for family and friends, but always knew there was a gap in the market to help people to get to know their pets. 

'At first I dismissed the idea, thinking it was far too crazy,' explains Celeste. 'But after my mother died in 2007 I started taking the idea more seriously. Life seemed too short not to give new things a try.

'So in 2008 I set up my Celestial Paws business, and started accepting clients for readings in 2009. Now I’ve produced horoscopes for well over 100 pets.

'It gives me a great sense of satisfaction to bring people even closer with their animals. Knowing your pet’s star sign can also be an invaluable aid when starting behaviour training too.'

Owners send Celeste a description or photograph of their prized pet and its birth details, and for £30 will receive a 7,000 word detailed reading based on the position of the sun when the animal was born.

Although the bulk of her business is for dogs and cats, Celeste will happily produce horoscopes for any species, whether horse, cow or reptile. She said: 'It is mostly cats and dogs, as the owners need to have the precise date their pet was born. That tends to be missing with other animals.'

But she admits not everyone is convinced, especially her husband David, 50. 'Although he is really supportive, David still chalks a lot of horoscopes as down to coincidence,' reveals Celeste.

'I can’t persuade him. I think my kids find it embarrassing too. It’s a bit quirky I suppose.'

Fiona has also written a dog owner’s guide to animal star signs - Sun Signs for K9S - with a proportion of profits donated to the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
