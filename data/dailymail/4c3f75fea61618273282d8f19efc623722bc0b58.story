Suffered multiple injuries: Hannah Windsor, 17, was found at a beauty spot after being stabbed to death in a horrific attack

A teenage girl was stabbed to death after being attacked at a secluded beauty spot.

The body of 17-year-old Hannah Windsor was found hidden in undergrowth close to the historic Bidston Hill Observatory on the outskirts of Birkenhead, Wirral.

A post-mortem found she died as a result of multiple injuries.

It is understood police officers were alerted after a walker found items belonging to a woman including a handbag, clothing and keys in an area of woodland.

Hannah, from Birkenhead, had been reported missing by staff at the assisted accommodation where she lived.

They launched an extensive search and the body of the teenager was later found in a secluded spot near a footpath close to the historic Bidston Hill Observatory on the outskirts of Birkenhead, Wirral.

Detectives arrested an 18-year-old man in the nearby village of Moreton.

He has been arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in custody where he is being questioned by detectives.

Last night, her family was said to be 'devastated' and were too upset to comment.

They were being comforted by family and friends and specially-trained police family liaison officers.

Police found the body of the girl at about 5.30pm on Saturday after a phone call from a member of the public.

With a peak of 231ft, Bidston Hill is one of the highest points on the Wirral and there has been a lighthouse on the site since the 1770s.

The Bidston Observatory was built in 1866 and stands in a large park of woods and grassland.

Up until 1969, the 'One O'Clock Gun' overlooking the River Mersey would be fired electrically from the Observatory.

It was later used by the Natural Environment Research Council but has stood empty since the council moved its operations to the University of Liverpool in 2004.

There have been various plans for the site but in recent years it has become a magnet for youths who congregate on the woodland to drink and take drugs.

Yesterday, friends and residents said they were shocked and upset at the death of the girl.

A Facebook group entitled 'R.I.P HANNAH WINDSOR /3' has over 500 members and friends of the teen have posted their tributes.

Establishing leads: Detectives believe Hannah knew her attacker and have asked for anyone with information to come forward

Katie Griffiths said: 'Rest in peace hannah, you were such a lovely girl, always had a smile on your face when I seen you around school, you will be missed by so many, you were an inspiration to so many people!'

Stacie Michelle Barker added: 'Hannah I can't cope knowing your not here anymore but I will see you soon.'I am trying to be strong but I can't I just keep bursting into floods of tears come visit me in my dream sweet heart love you.'

Another friend, Sammie Derbyshire, wrote: 'RIP Hannah. You were the best and you never did anything to hurt anyone whatsoever, you was an amazing girl and cannot believe that u have gone.'

Chloi Boden wrote: 'You was that type of girl who would say Hello to everyone you would pass in the street. The type of girl who I saw smiling ALL of the time.'

Hannah's friends have planned to gather at Birkenhead Park this evening to release Chinese lanterns in memory of the teenager.

Shocked neighbours and shopkeepers in the quiet village of Bidston said they were stunned as news broke of the grim discovery.

Tracey McNoon said: 'It is just so sad - everyone in the area is just devastated. You just cannot believe it is on your own doorstep. All the customers who came in were devastated.

'I have two young girls myself but you do not think anything like this could ever happen.'

Patrick William, who runs Hoylake Cafe, in nearby Hoylake Road, moved to the UK after fleeing the Taliban in his native Afghanistan.

He said: 'I came here thinking it would be safe. That poor girl - she was just so young.'

A resident living close to the park said: 'It is absolutely horrific that a teenage girl could be killed so brutally.

'It is just astonishing but we've been on at the council for some time to do something with the site as it is a magnet for teens drinking and taking drugs.

'There have been numerous problems. They hold parties down there and get up to all sorts of mischief.'

Another resident said: 'I've been told someone had put up a tent and the girl's possessions were found inside with her body just a short distance away. It is just so shocking. No-one can really quite believe it.'

Detective Inspector Mark Tivendale, of Merseyside Police, said: 'I would appeal to anyone who has any information which could help us with our inquiries to come forward and tell us.

'Hannah was first reported missing to police on Friday at 2.25pm and we understand that she was last seen on Wednesday afternoon.

'I am particularly interested in speaking to anyone who may have seen her since Wednesday to come forward as their information will help us to build up a picture of what happened to Hannah.

'We believe that Hannah knew the offender and we are appealing to anyone who may have been on Bidston Hill near to the observatory and saw anyone acting suspiciously to contact us.'
