Although all examine the camera, only one is brave enough to peck the lens

The birds make a clacking sound as the bob their heads toward the camera lens.

Finally, the bravest of the three ruffles its feathers and goes in for the peck. 

After tapping its beak against the lens several time, the owl seems to give up, confused, and returns to its perch. 

At one point, two of the birds pop their heads out of their tree hole to stare at the camera
