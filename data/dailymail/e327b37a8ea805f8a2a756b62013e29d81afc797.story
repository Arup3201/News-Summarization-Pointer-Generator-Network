A Star Wars mad Canadian may have taken the title of greatest ever father after building his son a Lego Boba Fett suit.

By using the mini Lego figurine as a source of inspiration, costume king, Keith Sheppard, 41, from Ontario, has been able to replicate the iconic character with incredible accuracy.

The graphic designer has spent over 100 hours building the child-sized bounty hunter for his Star Wars mad son, Caillen, seven.

And it’s no surprise that the fantastic suit took first place at this year’s Burlington Toycon convention in Ontario.

Both huge fans of the Star Wars series and the Lego brand, Mr Sheppard has previously made two other Lego mini figure designs for his son, learning and perfecting his craft with each attempt.

Constructed using using Sintra, a lightweight but rigid PVC material, Mr Sheppard was able to construct the torso, hands, jetpack, antenna, legs and most of the helmet.

While inside the helmet, Mr Sheppard used pink insulation foam board to carve the dome shape and a closed cell foam called Plastazote to carve the rocket tips and exhausts found on the jetpack.

But it's the attention to detail that really makes the suit something special. Not only was the costume spray painted and clear coated but Mr Sheppard even printed vinyl adhesives to copy the graphics on the tiny toy.

If that isn't enough, both the antenna and jetpack are in fact removable, just like the Lego version of the cult character, giving his son, Caillen, a welcome break from the full weight of the suit and turning him into a real living, breathing Lego Boba Fett.

However, Mr Sheppard has an even more ambitious idea in the pipeline and hopes to create a Star Wars Lego mini figure costume of a character that has not even yet been built by Lego.

Mr Sheppard said: ‘I've been a fan of Star Wars for 35 years and never made a Star Wars costume until now, If I hadn't a child, perhaps I would still be saying the same thing.

‘I've turned my attention from sculpting my own work to making costumes for him. We love the Star Wars Lego culture and Boba Fett is a great character to recreate.

‘Every Imperial figure would be awesome to build, but Boba Fett is so lush with colour, and has details that are both challenging and visually appealing.

‘Making a Star Wars costume for a child is cool - children are the perfect dimensions to bring the mini figure to life.

‘Caillen has an extensive Lego collection that includes among others, Star Wars. His love for the movies, characters and mini figures sort of rebooted my passion for both the Star Wars fan culture and the Lego brand.

‘I think the mini figure is reflected in a child. They share an innocence and playfulness and I believe that's why people react so positively to these types of costumes.

‘Considering this costume was both Star Wars and Lego, I was confident that it would be well received by fans of both communities. However, I never anticipated the costume going viral.

‘My partner is very supportive of my projects and loves the results. However, she's not a fan of both the mental and environmental chaos they create. Ultimately, she knows why I do it, for my son, and that makes her happy.’
