Comedian Jim Davidson has launched an angry tirade against Celebrity MasterChef winner Adrian Edmondson, labelling him an ‘arrogant, self-satisfied lefty’ and ‘the unfunniest man in the world’.

The outburst came in response to a newspaper article in which Edmondson criticised Davidson as being  ‘racist’, ‘homophobic’ and ‘dull’.

The Young Ones star clearly infuriated the former Big Break host, who was recently cleared of historical sex offence claims.

Davidson, 59, mocked Edmondson because his wife Jennifer Saunders is ‘more talented’ and ‘more famous’ than him.

Davidson posted a message on his website stating that he’d seen Edmondson criticising him, adding: ‘Getting a slagging from the unfunniest man in the world is funny, eh? I’ve never liked that arrogant self-satisfied lefty, and I am so glad I get up his snooty nose.

‘Imagine being a comedian and having a wife that is more talented, famous and funny?  Poor b******. Ade, I doubt you will read this, although your ego won’t allow you not to. Grow up you silly little boy.

‘Look forward to seeing you on celeb chef things again or showing us your country on BBC2, but don’t try and be funny – it’s pathetic!’

Edmondson previously complained that Davidson embodied the kind of comedy which he hates, and which inspired his own ‘alternative’ stance in the 1980s.

He said: ‘Comedy on TV was mainly men in dickie bows telling racist and homophobic gags – they were all like Jim Davidson. It was kind of dull.’

Reality: Davidson was thrown off Hell's Kitchen for allegedly making homophobic remarks

Edmondson, 56, beat Les Dennis and Janet Street-Porter to the MasterChef title on Friday after cooking a faultless three-course meal of venison and sea bass for judges John Torode and Gregg Wallace.

Five-times married Davidson has previously appeared on a TV cookery show himself – Hell’s Kitchen  in 2007 – but was axed after making homophobic comments in which he branded gay men ‘shirtlifters’.

The former Generation Game host  found himself in the news this year when he was arrested by officers from Operation Yewtree, the Metropolitan Police investigation into historic sex offence claims.

The Crown Prosecution Service said on August 31 that it had considered ten allegations against Mr Davidson but concluded there was ‘insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction in relation to all complaints’.

The comic’s solicitor Henri Brandman said: ‘My client Jim Davidson was, of course, arrested a number of months ago in respect of allegations of a historical sexual nature.

'He is pleased to have received news today that there will be no further action relating to the allegations.’

Davidson’s previous controversies include refusing to go on stage at Plymouth Pavilions in 2003, saying that he could not perform his act with wheelchair users watching from the front row.
