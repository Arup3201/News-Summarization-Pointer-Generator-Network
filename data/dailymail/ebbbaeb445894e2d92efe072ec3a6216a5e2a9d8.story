Over-zealous transport chiefs have been accused of wasting taxpayers' money after putting up 63 'no parking' signs along a one-mile country lane.Â 

Officials have installed one of the bright yellow warnings every 84ft along the rural West Pentire Road in Newquay, Cornwall.

The narrow lane already has double yellow lines, however Cornwall 
Council decided motorists needed more signage to keep the hedge-lined 
thoroughfare free of obstructions.

Over-zealous: transport chiefs have been accused of wasting taxpayers' money after putting up 60 'no parking' signs along the mile-long Rural West Pentire Road in Newquay, Cornwall

Sign of the times: The narrow lane already has double yellow lines, however Cornwall Council decided motorists needed more signage to keep the hedge-lined thoroughfare free of obstructions

Baffled locals have counted 63 of the metal poles bearing the signs, and say they can not understand why so many are needed as people very rarely attempt to park there anyway.

'During the summer there can be a bit of trouble with 
people parking on the grass verges and that's what they're trying to 
stop' said one neighbour, who asked not to be named.

'But nothing so bad as to warrant so many signs in one mile. 
They are lining the road, even opposite each other - it seems like a 
crazy and unnecessary expense.'

The Campaign to Protect Rural England says around two thirds of signs in rural areas are unnecessary.

The
 group has been lobbying since 1996 for local authorities, including 
Cornwall Council, to ditch pointless roadside clutter and their campaign
 led to 170 of 900 signs being pulled down last year in another Cornish 
village, Feock.

Spokesman Orlando Kimber said it was disappointing to hear the same authority had decided to erect 63 signs in a single lane.

He said: 'We have been running a campaign since 1996 to de-clutter the countryside in terms of unnecessary road signs.

'So it's disappointing to hear about just how many signs have been erected along this road.

'It sounds like utter nonsense, but someone, somewhere has come up with the rationale for this.'

Local councillor Lisa Shuttleworth said locals were shocked by the number of signs that suddenly sprang up before Christmas.

'A letter has been signed to see if we can rectify this,' she said.

'I think many residents are concerned with just how many signs have been erected.

'There have been talks going on and the parish council is trying to see if they can change the amount of signs.'

Ms 
Shuttlewood said she had asked the council's portfolio holder for 
Transport and Waste, Bert Biscoe, to come and take a look at the signs.

'He was of the same opinion as me and couldn't understand why so many are needed,' she said.

Cornwall Council said the notices were essential to enforce seasonal parking restrictions that run from June 1 to Sept 30.

In some places the road runs just a few hundred metres from the beach, and is also close to popular rambling route the South West Coast Path.

However, the unitary authority has 
agreed to consider 'alternative parking management options' that could 
eventually see some of them removed.

A
 spokesman said: 'This is likely to require changes to the operational 
times of the parking restrictions in the village, and a statutory 
consultation process will be required and must be satisfactorily 
completed before any changes to signing can take place.

'The
 operation of parking restrictions at the same time in the village is 
likely to result in the need for fewer signs which will look better and 
will not impact on enforcement operations.'
