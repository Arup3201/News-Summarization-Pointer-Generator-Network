Remorse: Sir David Nicholson has spoken of his 'bitter regret' over not speaking to patients and their families affected during the Stafford Hospital scandal

Outgoing NHS boss Sir David Nicholson has spoken of his 'bitter regret' over not speaking to patients and their families who were so badly treated during the Stafford Hospital scandal.

NHS England’s chief executive admitted his response to the Mid Stafforshire report – which revealed serious and systematic failures in care - had been one of the hardest lessons he learned during his 36-year career with the NHS.

Sir David said not talking to campaigners and other patients was his 'biggest mistake' of his service.

He avoided speaking to those affected because he did not want to be embroiled in a media circus - something he now says was the 'wrong call'.

Sir David, who came under intense scrutiny for his role in the fiasco, spoke candidly and at length about his role in the scandal at a health care conference in Manchester.

With just 27 days left in his post, Sir David spoke about a visit to the troubled hospital after a damning report into Stafford Hospital was published in 2009.

He told delegates at the Health and Care Innovation Expo in Manchester: 'The biggest and most obvious mistake that I made was when it became clear when the Health Care Commission reported on Mid Staffordshire.

'I went to the hospital and I didn't seek out the patients representatives and the people who were in Cure The NHS, and I didn't do it because I made the wrong call.

'At the time, Andy Burnham had been out and it had been turned into a media circus and I judged I didn't want to be involved in a media circus and I was wrong, I was absolutely wrong.

'Because one of the things I leaned, and I have determinedly done it since then, is that there is no shortcut to understanding and talking to patients and relatives and people, there is no shortcut to it.

'I didn't do it and then I got myself into a tangle of talking to people through the media, and that continues to be a very bad thing.

But Julie Bailey, who set up the campaign group Cure the NHS after her mother Bella died at the hospital, said Sir David had 'ample opportunity' to speak to the campaign group but never chose to do so

'That was a mistake that I made that I bitterly, bitterly regret.'

that Sir David had 'ample opportunity' to speak to the campaign group 
but never chose to do so.

'It
 is very easy to say when he is leaving and looking for a consultancy 
role,' she said. 'He had ample opportunity to come and meet us.

'Andy Burnham did not come to meet us and it was not a media circus.'

Despite his regrets, Sir David insisted he was right not to resign at the time.

He said: 'I’ve had some uncomfortable moments over all this. And if people and families of patients want to have a go at me, I accept that and will take it.

'But I decided to stay as I thought there was a danger the fallout from Mid Staffordshire could turn very horrible for the NHS overall, when we could use the report to make positive changes.

'I thought it would be irresponsible to wander off at that moment. But I am a human being and you cannot read the stuff about people being injured and harmed without being upset. I accept I made some mistakes in all that.”

In the past, Sir David said that part of his decision to stand down was driven by 'becoming the story' in the wake of the scandal.

Mid Staffordshire was the focus of one of the biggest scandals in the history of the NHS.

Inquiries into the scandal revealed that hundreds more people died at the trust than would have been expected.

Some patients were left lying in urine and excrement for days, forced to drink water out of vases or given the wrong medication.

The
 2009 investigation by the Healthcare Commission found that between 400 
and 1,200 more people died at the trust than would have been expected.

And
 Robert Francis QC, chair of the public inquiry, highlighted the 'appalling and unnecessary suffering' of hundreds of patients.

The trust was recently dissolved and key services will move to neighbouring hospitals.

Campaigners called for Sir David to be sacked after the publication of the public inquiry report into Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust.

He was in charge of the regional 
health authority responsible for the trust for a short period while 
patients were being mistreated.

Speaking
 about his short tenure in the Midlands, Sir David said: 'This is a hard
 conversation to have because whatever you say you sound defensive.

Campaigners called for Sir David to be sacked after the publication of the public inquiry report into Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust.

'I was the chief executive of the Birmingham and Black Country Strategic Health Authority, a pretty successful strategic health authority in lots of ways, and I was asked to take on the responsibilities for Shropshire and Staffordshire Strategic Health Authority and West Midlands South, as well as my job. I did each of them on one day a week.

'It was just closing them down because there had already been the decision made to reorganise them.

'Clearly I should have done more and I don't deny any of that at all.

'I worked in Birmingham and Black Country for thee years and about eight months in the rest of the West Midlands.

'With hindsight now, we should have taken more action quicker.'
