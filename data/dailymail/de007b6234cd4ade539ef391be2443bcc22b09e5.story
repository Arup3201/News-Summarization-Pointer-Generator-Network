At least 876 American children aged 10-19 took their own lives in 2013 with a gun, marking a 12-year peak in firearm suicides according to a new report from the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence.

The study, released on Monday and based on data from the CDC, found that the majority of the deaths - 82 percent - involved a weapon that belonged to a family member, in most cases a parent.

The increase in gun suicides by young people reflected a growing rise in the number of suicides generally among that age group.

Suicides have grown for the past three years after dipping after 2001 and now it is the second leading cause of death among children and teenagers after car deaths.

It replaced homicide as the number two cause. 

Twelve year peak: Using data from the CDC the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence study reveals suicides by guns are at a level not seen in more than a decade

The data on the number of young gun suicides was taken from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and according to the Brady Center is proof many of the death's are preventable.

'Millions of Americans have a gun in their homes thinking that it makes their family safer, but every day in our nation, dozens of these families learn just how dangerous and tragic that miscalculation can be.

'The bottom line is: having a gun in the home dramatically increases the danger that a child will be shot and killed.'

Indeed, with more than 80 percent of the deaths caused by a gun owned by a family member, the center said that removing weapons from the home or better gun education is key to reducing this figure.

On the rise: The study also showed that suicides by firearms are on the rise and have been on the increase for three years

Correlations: In states where there are least weapons the suicide by gun rate is lowest. In states where there are more guns, it is highest

'One of the most significant ways we can address this serious public health and safety issue is to educate parents about the risks of unsafe access to guns in the home,' said Gross.

'Parents are the first line of defense against gun violence, so we all need to realize the risks and take the appropriate steps to make sure our kids do not have unsafe access to guns.' 

'Every day, 48 children are wounded or killed by gunfire.' said Dan Gross.

The report also revealed that most annual total gun deaths occurred in states with the highest rates of gun ownership such as Louisiana and Wyoming.

Conversely it showed that the states with the fewest number of annual firearm deaths such as Hawaii and New York had the lowest gun ownership rates.
