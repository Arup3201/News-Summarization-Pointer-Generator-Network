More than 250 people have died in a series of avalanches across Afghanistan, following days of heavy snowfalls.

The death toll is expected to rise overnight as cold weather and difficult conditions are hampering rescue efforts, relief workers and U.N. officials said Friday.

Hundreds have been left homeless after avalanches destroyed their villages, and many more remained cut off from help as roads were blocked by deep snow.

The U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reports 229 dead in 18 of Afghanistan's 34 provinces, while reports from local sources claim at least 260 people are dead. 

The bulk of the deaths have come in Panjshir province, 60 miles northeast of the capital Kabu, where at least 186 people were killed, acting provincial governor Abdul Rahman Kabiri said.

Army helicopters are distributing supplies to people in areas of Panjshir as it is still unreachable by road.

'Helicopters are dropping medicines, blankets and other necessary items to remote areas of Panjshir,' Mohammad Aslam Syas, deputy chief of the Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority, said

Elsewhere in Afghanistan, 36 died in the remote northeastern province of Badakhshan, five in northern Baghlan, five in Parwan and 12 in Nuristan and Kunar provinces in the east, and five in western Badghis.

Six were killed in the central province of Bamiyan, four in Laghman and one in Nangarhar, both in the east - bringing the total toll to at least 260.  

Extremely cold temperatures were expected in many parts of the country in coming days, OCHA said.

Officials said the harsh conditions and lack of machinery were hampering efforts to reach people trapped, injured or dead. 

The army and some international agencies were delivering food, medicines, clothing and shelter to some of the hardest-hit areas, including far northern Badakhshan and Panjshir in the northeast.

Casualties are expected to climb as agencies reach the remote avalanche and flood-hit areas.

The Salang Tunnel, which links Kabul to northern Afghanistan, remained closed, and power supplies in the capital were intermittent.

Afghanistan has suffered through some three decades of war since the Soviet invasion in 1979. But natural disasters such as landslides, floods and avalanches have also taken a heavy toll on a country with little infrastructure or development outside of its major cities.

In May, a massive landslide killed anywhere from 250 to 2,700 people, authorities said at the time. Another landslide in 2012 killed 71 people. Authorities were not able to recover the vast majority of bodies and ended up declaring the site a mass grave.
