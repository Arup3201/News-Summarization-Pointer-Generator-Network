Jeremy Paxman at First World War graves: The BBC man says teachers rely too much on poetry to educate children about horror of the war

Teachers rely too much on poetry to educate children about the realities of the First World War, Jeremy Paxman has said.

After
 addressing a conference of teachers debating how to mark the centenary of
 the Great War, he said that the poems of Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred 
Owen 'fail to answer the really interesting questions'.

Teachers
 have long used poems such as Owen's Dulce et Decorum Est to teach 
pupils about the suffering of soldiers in the trenches. But Paxman said 
such an approach merely 'luxuriated in the horror' of the conflict.

After
 telling an audience that 'poetry is part of the problem of how we teach
 World War One', he lamented that the war was 'only ever taught as 
poetry now'.

'All that is 
taught is about the pointless sacrifice,' he told The Times. 'It's not 
helpful to see the whole thing through the eyes of poetry.'

Such
 an introduction to the war could lead to people 'passing on half-baked 
prejudices', he went on, adding: 'The big question is why Owen, after 
writing his anti-war poetry, and Sassoon, after his letter of protest, 
decided to go back and fight.'

'Luxuriating in the horror of the thing really won't do and doesn't set out to answer the really interesting questions.'

Paxman
 had earlier told the conference in London, organised by Wellington 
College and Wellington Academy, that a lack of a sense of duty made 
another war like the First World War 'unimaginable' now.

He
 said he believed that modern life is all about the 'pursuit of personal
 pleasure', a concept that would have been alien to young people during 
the Great War.

'There was 
what is notably absent now - another thing that I think makes this sort 
of conflict unimaginable in the future - there was a sense of duty,' Mr 
Paxman said.

'If you 
consider the way we lead our lives now, we lead our lives essentially in
 an atomised fashion, pursuing personal pleasure.

'It's all about personal choice; do what you want, please yourself.

'This was a world that was unknown to young people in 1914, 1915, 1916.'

Paxman
 last week said that modern society is too ‘self-obsessed’ and 
‘hedonistic’ to breed the kinds of soldiers needed for a conflict like 
the First World War.

Speaking
 at a literature festival in Dubai, he said the idea of ‘duty’ had now 
diminished in favour of ‘personal freedom’, adding: ‘What would [the 
younger] generation fight for? The right to use your iPhone? What are 
the great noble causes?’

He 
added: ‘Ideas of duty, clearly strongly felt by many people, have 
diminished as the international significance of the country has 
diminished.

‘We live in such
 a relativistic society now, and materialist, self-obsessed and 
hedonistic; it’s hard to imagine circumstances under which people would 
say that “it is worth it, I am willing to risk my life and well-being 
for this.”’

Mr Paxman, 63, 
said he had ‘no doubt whatsoever’ that the war would not be fought today
 but that in his opinion, ‘some things are worth fighting for.’

Social media generation: Paxman also claimed recently that a conflict like the First World War would not happen today because society is too 'self-obsessed' and 'hedonistic'

Wednesday's conference conference also heard from the novellist Michael 
Morpurgo, the author of War Horse, who said he believed that all young 
people should visit not just British war graves but German ones too to 
ensure that they understand "where we come from".

The
 best-selling writer and former children's laureate also suggested that 
children need to be told personal stories about historical events such 
as the First World War because these are often too big for them to 
comprehend.

Mr Morpurgo said stories are able to get through to people in a way that history books are unable to do.

He
 told delegates he wanted to inspire and alert young minds to what 
happened during the war because it was 'the critical moment of our 
times, it was the cusp of history'.

'Over the top' during the Battle of the Somme. Paxman believes nothing like this war would ever happen again because the young men and women of today have no motivation to fight or 'ideas of duty'

'I
 think it should be, I won’t say obligatory, but the minister of 
education in me says obligatory, for every child to go there and stand 
there and look at those graves, but not just our graves, to go to the 
German graves where actually they don’t go,' he said.

'Because
 they were sons and fathers just as our boys were. So I think that’s 
important because we are living in this world where we travel, we are 
European, we feel together with these people but it is important for us 
to know where we come from.'

He also said that fiction and stories can teach people about different topics.

'Of
 course history has to be the basis of it, that’s absolutely the case, 
but it is the case also that the records that are left behind, that is 
the diaries, the letters home, those voices which speak from the heart, 
from the front to those who are loved at home, or simply jotted down, or
 the poems that they wrote, they have a way of getting through to us as a
 history book might not be able to do.'

Speaking on how to educate pupils about the war, Michael Morpurgo said stories are able to get through to in a way that history books are unable to

He
 added: 'What I’ve tried to do all my writing life and all my teaching 
life is to bring stories to children. And I think the critical thing 
about making stories that work for children is that the children have to
 somehow feel the reality of the story.'

Mr
 Morpurgo said that teachers can stand in front of pupils and tell them 
about a major moment in history - such as the atrocity of the Holocaust.

'It’s
 all huge, it’s all too massive to comprehend such suffering and anyway 
for them, it was then, so whilst they might write an essay about it and 
somehow you’ve told them that story, you haven’t touched them, and you 
and I all know the way to touch them - they read Anne Frank.

'They go there and they know it then, and they care about it because they care about one person.'

In
 a written statement for the conference, organised by Wellington College
 and Wellington Academy, David Cameron said that children must be taught
 to understand the significance of the First World War and the debt owed
 to the generation who fought in it.

The
 Prime Minister insisted that pupils must learn why war broke out, what 
it was like for those involved and how the conflict helped to shape 
modern society.

And he suggested that schools should not 'shy away' from teaching pupils about the realities of the conflict.

He
 said that this year’s centenary will be a 'hugely important national 
moment' which will bring people together to reflect on the sacrifices 
made by many men and women.

'I
 want to put children at the front and centre of those commemorations, 
so that they too understand the significance of the conflict and the 
debt we owe that generation.'

The
 Prime Minister said pupils need to learn why war broke out, and how 
'political alliances and rivalries' could have such an impact on the 
lives of people around the world.

He added: 'Visiting the sites where it took place is a sobering reminder of those realities.

'Seeing
 the thousands of names that cover the memorials, the row upon row of 
headstones, brings to life the scale of the sacrifice.'

As
 many people as possible should visit the battlefields, which is why the
 Government is giving two pupils and one teacher from every state 
secondary school the chance to go to the Western Front, Mr Cameron said.
