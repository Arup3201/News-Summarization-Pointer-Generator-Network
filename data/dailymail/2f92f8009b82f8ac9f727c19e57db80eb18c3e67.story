Meet Shouta. He runs a casino in Macau.

But that's not his only job. He also 'removes' people, in the Yakuza sense of the word.

Now, in a remarkable new documentary - Black Business: Modern Day Yakuza - Shouta reveals what it's like to work for Japan's organised crime syndicate.

As the title credits roll, the screen reads: 'Forget what you think you know... Japan is not all smiles and friendly customer service.'

According to a new short film, Shouta (pictured) is a member of the Yakuza, the Japanese mafia

Shouta runs a casino in Macau but also has 'other business interests' in the US and Asia

Cigarette in hand, Shouta is then asked if he has ever killed someone.

He replies: 'I don't kill people. I just "remove" them. There are certain situations that call for "removal".

'And removing someone is not just like firing someone,' he remarks ominously.

Later in the footage, he adds: 'In our line of business, when a problem arises, we must act without hesitation.'

The film was directed by videographer Luke Huxham, who is based just outside Tokyo.

The Yakuza is believed to have more than 100,000 members spread across the country in different gangs.

Together, they make the largest organised crime group in the world.

In the film, which runs at just under 9 minutes long, Shouta, in his early thirties, reveals that his 'career' choice runs in the family.

His father, and a good friend of his father, were both in the Yakuza.

The film - Black Business: Modern Day Yakuza - was directed by videographer Luke Huxham, who wanted to capture what life is like in the Japanese mafia in the modern age

Shouta says that he had problems at school and was sent by his family to study in America.

He now looks after various 'business interests' - and splits his time between the US and Asia.

As well as dealing in prostitution, real estate and stockbroking, the Yakuza's latest emphasis has been on money-lending, according to Shouta - and not just in Japan.

During the interview, Shouta also discusses how corruption extends to both the police and government.

'We have people within the police who are willing to help us, and also a strong connection to the political world.

'Is our business that bad? Look at all the corrupt politicians... well, possibly corrupted by us.'

Towards the end of the film, he says: 'Do I feel guilty? No, not at all. We are simply businessmen.'

When Mail Online asked Huxham whether Shouta was a genuine member of the Yakuza, he declined to answer, leaving it up to viewers to decide

Last year, Huxham made another documentary about the Japanese underworld, called Underground Hero: Love To Hate Me, which concerned a Lamborghini fanatic.

Both films were produced by Maiham Media, which states on YouTube: 'Japan is famous for many things, such as technology, sushi, temples, geisha and amazing customer service.

'One side of Japan not often seen but living in plain sight are the people conducting in "Black Business", the Yakuza.Â

'They're not petty criminals confined to the streets - they're international businessmen.

'Using knowledge, money, powers of persuasions and their influence in the government to help secure them lucrative international black business deals.

'To the everyday citizen, they serve as no threat, often polite and well spoken but if you are one to do business with them - make no mistake: they're ruthless, calculated people that will not hesitate to better their position at your expense.'

We have been warned.
