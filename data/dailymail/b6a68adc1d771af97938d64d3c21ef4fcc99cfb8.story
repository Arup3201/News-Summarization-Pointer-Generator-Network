With constant daily reminders on the radio, weather updates can sometimes fall on deaf ears.

But police in Surrey made sure their messages were heard loud and clear on Thursday, by rapping their way through road safety rules in a string of Twitter posts.

Officers took to the site to advise motorists, taking inspiration from the 1993 song, Boom! Shake the Room!

Surrey Police got their message across loud and clear in a series of 90s style raps on Thursday

A spokesman for Surrey Police said they were glad to be able to inject 'humour and humanity' into their road safety warnings

Officers rhymed their road safety guidelines on the micro-blogging site to the entertainment of hundreds of other users

In an homage to the No 1 hit by The Fresh Prince and DJ Jazzy Jeff, officers posted: 'Yo, back up now and give a brother room. The roads are wet and 
you're about to go #boom.'

They continued: 'Hyped up, psyched up, slipping ‘n’ sliding, Standing water is a risk for colliding #boom', to the entertainment of hundreds on the micro-blogging site. 

Their finale mimicked the song's chorus, warning: '#Boom brake-brake-brakes need room...Back-back-back-back-Vroom!'.

Surrey police also took to Twitter in December to warn drivers of road ice in a version of 80s song Ice Ice Baby

The posts took inspiration from a 1993 Fresh Prince song

They were applauded by Twitter users who appreciated their unusual campaign to improve road safety.

But critics questioned whether it was a good use of police time posting such a bizarre message.

A spokesman for Surrey Police told Metro: 'Surrey Police is always working to keep people safe and where we can insert some humour and humanity into our safety messages it seems to help them spread further'.

'Love it or hate it, the aim of the rap is to get people talking and thinking about road safety and if it prevents someone from getting injured then job done!'

'Hopefully it raised a few smiles on a wet Friday morning!'

This is the second time the officers have rapped their way through weather updates, after taking on the 1980s Vanilla Ice hit, Ice Ice Baby, in December to warn drivers of frosty road conditions.

They posted their Tweets after heavy fog caused a massive car pile up in Kent on Wednesday morning which officers described as the worst accident to have ever been caused by fog on British roads.

More than 200 people were injured in the accident which saw 100 cars pile on top of one another along a 500 yard stretch of busy road.
