Gough Whitlam’s iconic 1972 campaign song, ‘It’s Time’ captured the nation's attention to lead the Australian Labor Party to victory, despite not mentioning the words ‘Labor, ‘Gough’ or ‘Whitlam’ once.

And 42 years later, the ALP anthem remains one of the most successful and innovative campaign strategies in Australian politics.

Former prime minister Gough Whitlam, the reformist Labor leader who was famously dismissed from his post in 1975, died aged 98.

Tributes to the late leader frequently mention the historical, simple slogan, 'It's Time' as it has become synonymous with Whitlam's legacy. 

The anthem of the same title was an important moment for both Australian politics and for the arts.

Gough Whitlam's 'It's Time' campaign was one of the most effective in Australia's history, remembered for its iconic campaign song

The song was performed by a star-studded line up of Australian singers, actors, sport star and other media personalities. 'It's Time' was led by soul singer Alison McCallum (pictured)

The stirring anthem paved the way for future political campaigns by recruiting some of Australia’s most treasured musicians, actors and entertainment identities to perform the song – a tactic which was largely unheard of at the time.

Jacki Weaver, Jack Thompson, Bert Newton and Barry Crocker were just a few of the group of Aussie stars who lent their support to the ALP party, recording the song and appearing in the clip, led by soul singer Alison McCallum.

One of the celebrities involved was Australian singer “Little Pattie" also known as Patricia Amplett, who revealed what it was like to be involved in such a huge moment in history.

It’s time for freedom, It’s time for moving, It’s time to begin, Yes It’s time

It’s time Australia, It’s time for moving, It’s time for proving, Yes It’s time

It’s time for all folk, It’s time for moving, It’s time to give, Yes It’s time

It’s time for children, It’s time to show them, Time to look ahead, Yes It’s time

Time for freedom, Time for moving, Time to be clear, Yes It’s time

Time Australia, Time for moving, It’s time for proving, Yes It’s time

Time for better, Come together, It’s time to move, Yes It’s time

Time to stand up, Time to shout it, Time, Time, Time, Yes It’s time

Time to move on, Time to stand up, time to say ‘yes’, Yes It’s time

‘The ''It's Time'' commercial was far more effective than anyone could have imagined,’ Ms Amphlett told SMH in 2012.

‘Long before Live Aid, it came as a shock to some people that popular personalities would stand up publicly and be counted for a cause.’ 

Photos from Gough Whitlam's personal collection were used in the clip in the hope of helping the public relate to Gough. The campaign strategists wanted him to seem more warm and personable

The song used Labor’s now famed slogan ‘It’s time’ to create an jingle as part of a television campaign, calling Australians to action and energising them for an ‘era of change’.

Pre-campaign research had found that Gough Whitlam needed to be ‘humanised’ for the Australian public, so he seemed warmer, more personable and relatable for the Australian public.

Researchers were also told that his wife, Margaret Whitlam, was not seen enough by the public.

Jacki Weaver, Jack Thompson, Bert Newton and Barry Crocker were part of the large group of Aussie stars who recorded the song and appeared in the clip for the ALP

The concept was created by Paul Jones and Mike Shirley, who planned the song, the performers and candid images of Whitlam.

These photographs are the only mentions of the party in the clip – the song is entirely delivered by familiar faces and Australian citizens.

They decided to use photos from the Labor party leader’s personal collection, showing him with his family and at work throughout the video.

The song was recorded by the throng of personalities at Hordern Pavillion in Sydney’s east, where the atmosphere was 'electric'

The song was recorded by the throng of personalities at Hordern Pavillion in Sydney’s east.

According to Ms Amphlett, the atmosphere was ‘electric.’

The song aimed to reach out to a society, promising that change was imminent.

At the time, Australia was at war with Vietnam and facing a string of issues, such as women’s rights, Indigenous injustices and the high costs of education and healthcare. 

The song was a hit, launched on the night of Whitlam's famed policy launch, when he made a stirring speech in Sydney's west.

The speech and song were coordinated to capture the attention and raise the hopes of Australians. 

'I do not for a moment believe that we should set limits on what we can achieve, together, for our country, our people, our future,' Whitlam said during the pre-election speech in Bankstown.

Similarly, the song urged Australians to move, look ahead and begin. 

Whitlam led the Labor Party roaring back to power after 23 years in the political wilderness.

It abolished the last remnants of the White Australia Policy, established relations with China, recognised Indigenous land rights, created Medibank, scrapped tertiary education fees and reduced the voting age to 18.

After three years in office, Whitlam was historically dismissed by Governor-General John Kerr on November 11, 1975.
