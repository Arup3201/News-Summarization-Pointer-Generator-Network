TV stations in Romania have been rocked by a prostitution scandal after more than 30 presenters and models were arrested in an investigation into a call girl ring.

Prosecutors in the capital Bucharest say 33 women are being investigated, some of them household names in the country, for their part in the £10,000 per night ring.

Police say that so far seven women are facing charges, with one fleeing to Dubai and another 25 still being investigated.

They add that up to another 30 women could be involved in the conspiracy.

Six of the defendants have been named in the local media as Playboy playmate Diana Nicoras aged 20, and fellow models Diana Guresoaie, 24 and Lavinia Despina, 29.

Also named are Ramona Popescu, 24, Mirela Dumitru, 25, and Georgiana Constantin, 21.

They are set to appear at a district court in the capital on Friday.

Investigators say that the ring's organisers charged up to £1,500 just to introduce a client to one of the women, who included Playboy models and presenters.

The alleged offences date back to August last year and the Fifth District Court of Bucharest have been monitoring the situation.

Both Daniela Crudu, left, and Madalina Pamfile, right also had their homes raided as part of the inquiry and have been quizzed by police 

TV hosts Daniela Crudu, Madalina Pamfile and Simona Trasca, have also had their homes raided and been quizzed as part of the investigation.

Miss Crudu told local media: 'I was sleeping and woke up when the police hammered at the door.

'I was one of the first girls to be questioned. They asked me if I know certain girls and I said I did, but I can’t tell you more.'
