Continued sightings of a five-metre great white shark off the Newcastle coast have closed beaches for a fourth straight day. 

Swimmers and surfers were forced to evacuate at the weekend following the sighting of a great white shark at Merewether Beach, after the shark alarm sounded around 1pm on Saturday.

The coastal stretch between Nobbys and Stockton beaches in Newcastle remain closed for a fourth consecutive day after lifeguards spotted the large shark on Monday morning.

Council Lifesavers have voiced their frustration at the timing of the shark appearances, but have vowed that they will not be reopening the beaches until the sharks have left the area.

Following the sighting of a great white shark at Merewether Beach, the entire coastline remains shut down

Nobbys Beach inspector Scott Hammerton told Daily Mail Australia he was called to the northern end of Burwood Beach at about 2.30pm on Tuesday.

‘I got a call from some patrolling water police about a large shark sighting. They confirmed it was a great white, five-metres in length and very thickset.’

‘It came up to their boat to have a look then it gave them a flick with it’s tail and went underwater. It dashed off towards the surf zone where they lost it. It just disappeared under the rocks,’ he said.

Earlier in the day, lifeguards spotted another large shark off Stockton breakwall as well as another sighting at Dudley.

Mr Hammerton said council lifeguards, water police and a Westpac Rescue Helicopter would continue to search the beaches until the sharks had left. 

‘We’ve gotta keep going. These are big sharks that could cause harm to swimmers and we aren’t going to take any risks.’

‘This is the peak of the season and we want people to be enjoying themselves out in the water, however we are not going to budge and let people in the water until they have left.’

Mr Hammerton if there are no sightings after a thorough search on Wednesday morning, they may reopen the beach.

Newcastle beaches have been closed for a fourth straight day following the sighting of a great white shark

When asked why the sharks are sticking around, he said there are two prevailing theories.

‘One idea is that it’s a great white sanctuary. They might be coming in close to the shore to offer warm water to give birth and raise their young.’  

‘The other idea is that the sharks started appeared in line with a cold current on Saturday. There has been a lot of marine activity in the area since then and the sharks may be following suite,’ he said.  

Newcastle City Council beach inspector Mick Body says the closure has been the longest in his memory.

'We're a little bit frustrated, especially today because it's such a nice day,' he said.

'We are still searching and being cautious, we're constantly getting sightings from members of the public.'  

Mr Body said he was waiting for the Westpac Life Saver Helicopter to fly over the coastline and hopefully give the all clear.

The helicopter has been busy with medical emergencies throughout Tuesday.

While some surfers have found the waves too tempting, most had kept clear of the water since the shark was first seen on Saturday afternoon at Merewether Beach.

The latest sighting at Dudley beach on Tuesday morning could indicate the shark was moving south of Newcastle, reversing its northbound route overnight.    

Several jet skis and speed boats scoured the water after the shark alarm sounded around 1pm on Saturday

Although a jet ski has been patrolling the beaches, Mr Body said a helicopter was needed to get a good look.

'They might see more action in the ocean than we can see on a jet ski,' he said.

The helicopter will be searching for a shadow of the shark close to shore or behind the break.

Increased marine activity and overcast and warm weather are thought to be possible reasons for the shark's prolonged presence.

Rob Townsend, life sciences manager at Manly Sea Life Sanctuary, said the shark's behaviour in staying close to the coastline was not unusual.

'It may be hunting eagle rays, which are a favourite food for sharks and are found close to the shore,' he said.

'Great whites are very variable. They spend time in the surf where they are sometimes spotted by lifeguards and then they also have their massive oceanic migration where they travel to South Africa. They are very adaptable.'

He added that people were better safe than sorry and should keep out of the water while the shark continues to be spotted. 

Lifeguards spotted the shark on Monday and are monitoring its progress between Nobbys and Stockton

Nearby resident, 14-year-old keen surfer Nicholas Tonks captured a photograph of the five-metre shark swimming behind a lifesaver on a jetski on Saturday.

'My house is pretty close to the beach so when I heard the shark alarm go off, I grabbed my camera and quickly dashed down,' the young photographer told Daily Mail Australia. 

'I was overlooking the beach and saw a lot of jetskis around so I looked through the lens of my camera and snapped a few shots. It wasn't until I got home, I realised I got a picture of the shark.'

'There were no attacks reported but the lifeguards did a great job to maintain and get everyone out of the water - they were very visual on their jetskis as well.'    

'It's quite irregular to have them hanging around constantly,' he said. 

It comes just less than a week after multiple sharks were spotted at the iconic Bondi Beach, forcing beachgoers out of the water and shutting down for a couple of hours until it was all clear again.
