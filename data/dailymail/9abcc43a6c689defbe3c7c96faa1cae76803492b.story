A huge gorilla showed off his impressive strength with a workout that put even the most committed gym-goers to shame.

Kivu, a western lowland gorilla, did not let his size stop him as he climbed, swung and flexed in his own private gym.

Using a wooden platform to hold on to he easily completed a set of pull-ups.

Kivu completes a strong workout session using his wooden climbing frame at Paignton Zoo, in Devon

The huge primate then turned his hand to crunches, throwing himself backwards off the climbing frame, in Paignton Zoo, Devon, and pulling his legs in.   

The hilarious snaps were taken by photographer Chris Rockey. 

Mr Rockey, also from Paignton, said: 'One minute he was just sat there and then he started climbing and swinging.'

Kivu arrived at the zoo in 2006. His keepers describe him as 'a very smart gorilla, who loves showing off'.

After his arrival Royal Marines had to rebuild the frame to ensure it could withstand the strength and weight of the gorillas.

The 13-year-old loves using it to show off, according to his keepers.

The 13-year-old western lowland gorilla uses his arms to pull himself up so he's hanging upside down underneath the roof of the frame 

Much like a human's pull-up the huge primate uses just his arms to lift all of his weight. An adult male gorilla can weigh up to 400lbs (181kg)

A spokesman for Paignton Zoo said: 'Kivu is very playful.

'As well as his climbing frame, he also likes to sit inside large blue plastic barrels and glare at visitors close-up through the windows.

'It is wonderful to see the gorillas flex their muscles. We should respect the wild world and when you see Kivu like this it reminds you what superb creatures they are.

'It is one reason we have zoos, so people can see wild animals they wouldn't normally be able to and be utterly amazed at their size, strength, and character.'

After hanging for a few minutes Kivu throws himself backwards while holding on to the wood tightly. Photographer Chris Rockey said: 'One minute he was just sat there and then he started climbing and swinging'

Playful Kivu looks like he is enjoying being upside down as he tucks his legs behind him. The frame was rebuilt by Royal Marines so it could hold six large gorillas 

An adult male gorilla can weigh up to 400lbs (181kg) and can grow up to 6ft (1.8m) tall.

Paignton Zoo has a bachelor group, which has six of the critically endangered species in.

Some of the gorillas may move on to be the dominant males in bachelor or family groups as part of a European breeding programme.

The mesmerizing creature ends his workout on the top of the wooden structure, holding on to a piece of rope while he takes a breather
