Heartbreaking end: Rita Corpin, 72, a retired California teacher, was found dead sitting in a chair with a kitten in her lap in a yard bursting at the seams with debris

California firefighters wearing hazmat suits had to climb over vegetation and trash piled 5 feet high to get to a yard where a woman died in a chair amid debris with a kitten resting in a carrier on her lap.

First responders arrived Tuesday night at the Santa Ana home of Rita Corpin, 72, who was pronounced dead in her yard. No foul play is suspected.

Corpin owned two other properties where animal control officials attempted Wednesday to capture more than 60 feral cats.

The retired high school history teacher owned two dogs and fed area cats regularly, Santa Ana police Cpl. Anthony Bertagna told OC Register.

Her home was so choked with refuse and debris that Corpin could no longer enter it; instead, the retiree lived alone in an old yellow Toyota truck parked in her driveway, Bertagna said.

It took firefighters three hours to remove Corpin's body from the property in the 1400 block of South Rosewood Avenue because of the trash and overgrown plants.

The elderly hoarder was discovered at around 10.30pm Tuesday by her gardener after he got a call from a neighbor asking to check up on Corpin because she had stopped feeding cats.

Over the past decade, the hoarding and neglect at Corpin's properties prompted 26 contacts by Santa Ana city officials, city spokeswoman Tanya Lyon said.

The city levied fines totaling $900 and warned Corpin about her properties' poor condition, but she eventually refused to allow city officials on her properties, Lyon said.

By doing some minor cleaning, Ms Corpin prevented the city from seeking a search warrant to perform inspections.

A member of the Orange County Task Force on Hoarding's executive committee, Fire Inspector Darren Johnson, said the group had not worked with Corpin.

'I wish we would have known about this,' Johnson said. 'We probably could have salvaged her.'

According to Corpin's brother, David, Rita spent 48 years teaching world history at La Quinta High School where she was known for being eccentric and solitary.

‘She may have had a “pack-rat” problem, but other than that, she was great,’ a devastated David Corpin said. ‘She was a good person, she cared about people and animals.’

At one time, Corpin served on Santa Ana’s Planning Commission and was active in the town’s historical society.

A former colleague said things took a turn for the worse when Corpin’s boyfriend died from an apparent heart attack 15 years ago.

OC Weekly pointed out that Corpin left her teaching job sometime in 2010, retiring with a $120,000 pension, according to the site Transparent California. She owned three homes in Santa Ana, which she used as havens for feral cats.

In 2012, Rita Corpin was interviewed by KABC during a communal Thanksgiving dinner held at the Honda Center.

Looking disheveled in a knit cap, the woman told a reporter that holidays were tough for her because she was living all alone.
