Dani Alves could be heading out of the Nou Camp after revealing that he hasn't been offered a new contract by Barcelona. 

The Brazilian is heading into the last six months of his contract and insists that despite the uncertainty about his future, he will not be distracted by the speculation. 

Alves has won 13 trophies in his time with Barcelona but is now open to talk to other clubs ahead of a move at the end of the season.

'I have a contract until the summer,' he told reporters in Barcelona. 

'I'm a Barcelona player and I'm not interested in negotiating an exit. I want to finish these six months in the best way possible, and afterwards, we'll see.

'At the moment I've not been offered a renewal. But I'm relaxed. It is what it is.'

With Martin Montoya also expected to be leaving the club in 2015 and summer-signing Douglas having made just three starts, the right-back position could be an issue for Barcelona.

The club would not be able to sign a replacement for the 31-year-old after FIFA banned them from making any signings in 2015, however, Alves insists this is not a concern for him. 

'The problem of leaving them weak on the flank is not my problem, but Barcelona's.'
