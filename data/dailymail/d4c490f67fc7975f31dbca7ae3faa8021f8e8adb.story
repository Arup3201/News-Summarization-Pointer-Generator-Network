Actress Liz Hurley and her cricket legend fiance Shane Warne are cementing their love - by giving their £6million country mansion a makeover.

The showbiz pair are planning to return the historic Georgian mansion house to its former glory.

The couple want to demolish an ugly modern conservatory and replace it with a luxurious garden room overlooking the rolling Herefordshire countryside.

Makeover: Liz Hurley and Shane Warne want to bring their Herefordshire mansion back to its former glory

Plans: These drawings submitted to Herefordshire council show how the couple want to demolish an old conservatory and add a garden room

Retreat: The loved-up couple, who got engaged in 2011, are said to spend as much time as possible in the country mansion

And they also want to add en-suite 
bathrooms to some of the 13 bedrooms and turn an old staircase into a 
Hollywood-style feature.

The couple bought the Grade II-listed property last year.

Set in 200 acres, it boasts a tennis court, fishing lake, housekeeper accommodation and its own 21-acre woodland.

The couple's planning application states: 'The interior works will consist of a sensitive refurbishment and redecoration.

Investment: The couple bought the Grade-II property last year and want to add en-suite bathrooms to some of the 13 bedrooms

'Windows and doors will be repaired and refurbished while two windows currently blocked up will be reinstated.

'In
addition to general refurbishment and redecoration works, the overall 
ambition of the works is to undo a lot of the damage done over the last 
century with inappropriate design choices.

'All our works to the property seek to either repair, restore or reinstate the historic fabric of the building, or if new, to be historically in keeping and appropriate in style to the building.'

Miss Hurley, 48, who starred in Austin Powers and Bedazzled, previously lived across the border in Gloucestershire when she was dating actor Hugh Grant.

But after meeting Australian spin bowler and reformed playboy Warne, 43, she sold up and they bought the house together.

The pair became engaged in 2011 and try to spend as much time as possible together in their country retreat.

A villager, who did not want to be named, said: 'It's a beautiful old mansion but it needs a lot of money spending on it.

'We don't see a lot of Liz and Shane but maybe once the place is up to scratch they will be spending more time there.

'I hope they get planning permission - I can't see many people objecting to them restoring the place to its former glory.'

Herefordshire Council will give a decision on whether the work can go ahead on July 11 - the day after the Ashes series between England and Australia gets under way.

They grew up thousands of miles apart but both in decidedly bland home towns.

Elizabeth
Hurley was raised in Basingstoke, which is nicknamed ‘Roundabout City’ 
or ‘Doughnut City’ because of the number of large roundabouts.

It
was targeted by the Germans during the Second World War, but in the 
late 1960s the town planners carried on where the Luftwaffe left off by 
developing it into an ‘expanded town’.

That resulted in many historic buildings being replaced by a shopping centre, multi-storey car park, office blocks and estates.

Miss
Hurley is believed to have grown up in a four-bedroom detached 
property, pictured top, in Basingstoke. It was sold
several years ago for £415,000.

Meanwhile, Shane Warne grew up in a suburban bungalow 25 miles from Melbourne, Australia, similar to that pictured bottom.

Upper
Ferntree Gully is part of a sprawling region that is home to a mix of 
white- and blue-collar workers, artists, writers and actors.

In
its earlier days, after the Second World War, it was known as the ‘end 
of the train line’, making it popular for day trippers and families 
taking weekly holidays.

But
by the time Shane Warne was born to parents Keith and Brigitte in 
September 1969, Upper Ferntree Gully had become a rather bland suburb.
