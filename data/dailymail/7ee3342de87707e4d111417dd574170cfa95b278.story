Seven people, including two children, needed hospital treatment after a coach carrying 34 British holidaymakers crashed in the French Alps.

The coach was taking the party from the Alpine ski resort of La Rosière to Chambéry airport when it skidded off the motorway and flipped on to its side.

Witnesses described the vehicle swerving out control, leaving the road, and then coming to rest by guard rails at the edge of a ravine.

Lucky escape: Seven people were hurt, none seriously, when this coach carrying 34 British tourists crashed on its way from an Alpine ski resort to a nearby airport where it was due to meet a plane back to the UK

Dramatic pictures showed the coach lying on its side, with windows smashed. No other vehicles were involved.

Around 50 firefighters were scrambled to the rescue, but those hurt suffered only minor injuries most passengers escaped unhurt.

Today members of ‘two British families’ remained in Chambéry, where a victim suffering from a broken wrist was still being treated, said a spokesman for the Savoie prefecture.

He added: ‘Around fifteen people underwent examinations and treatment following the accident, with seven taken to hospital in Chambéry.’

The spokesman said the bus driver was ‘slightly wounded’ in the hand, and was being interviewed about the possible cause of the accident.

It is thought he might have suffered a sudden bout of illness before losing control of the vehicle.

There is no indication that the driver, an ex-Navy serviceman with 20 years of experience in transport, had been drinking.

His coach, registered in the nearby resort of Megeve, was equipped with an ‘anti-sleep system’.

Tailbacks: The crash and ensuing rescue operation led to 10-mile traffic jams on the A43 motorway

Everybody on board was wearing a seat belt – a fact which is likely to have cut down the number of injuries significantly.

The coach skidded off the A43 motorway and overturned near the village of Sainte-Hélène-du-Lac at around 8.45am on Sunday morning, The Guardian reported. 

Seven people sustained injuries to their wrists or arms and were taken to a nearby hospital while six others were treated for shock.

The rescue operation caused 10 miles of tailbacks, AFP reported. The A43 links La Rosière with Lyon or joins the road to Grenoble.

Picturesque: The holidaymakers had spent a week at La Rosière ski resort in the French Alps

La Rosière is a relatively small, family-focused ski resort near the Italian border. It was developed in the early 1950s on the site of an old hamlet.

The coach party was on its way to catch charter flights to Southampton and Manchester. All of those involved has spent a week in France, arriving last Sunday week.

Alpine roads in eastern France are packed with people heading to and from ski holidays at this time of year. Snow, ice and poor visibility often makes journeys particularly treacherous.

The cause of the crash was unknown but authorities said that an investigation was underway.
