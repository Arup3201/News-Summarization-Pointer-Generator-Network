The frantic family of a schoolgirl who vanished after telling friends she was going to a party yesterday pleaded with her to get in touch.

Detectives are growing increasingly concerned for the safety of 14-year-old Esme Smith, who disappeared more than a week ago.

Instead of going to a party near her home in Surrey, she boarded a train to London and was last seen shortly after arriving at Waterloo station – approximately 40 miles from where she lives.

Missing: Esme Smith, 14, who has not been seen since getting the train to London to go to a party a week ago

She has not made contact with her friends or family since.

CCTV images of the teenager at Waterloo show she had changed out of her school uniform and into a white flowery dress. She was also wearing a blue denim jacket and was carrying a black school bag and black floral bag with chain straps.

Police say the longer Esme is missing the more anxious they are about her safety.

Last night her 19-year-old  sister, Sian, made an emotional appeal to the missing girl, describing her as ‘extrovert, vivacious, normal’.

She said: ‘Esme, if you are reading this, I just want to say please come home or at least get in touch so that we know that you are safe.

‘We are all really worried about you and we just want to make sure you are OK.

‘You are not in any trouble so please just get in touch.’

Last night Esme’s mother, Dinah Smith, 39, was too upset to talk at the family’s detached home in Farnham, Surrey – which she shares with the schoolgirl’s father, 50-year-old Mark Smith.

Detective Sergeant Antony Preston from Surrey Police Missing Persons Unit said: ‘We are following up a number of lines of enquiry and we have had a number of calls as to Esme’s whereabouts, but as time goes on our concerns about her welfare remain.

‘Anyone who has seen a girl matching her description or who knows her and has any information about her whereabouts is urged to contact us as soon as possible. Similarly, if Esme sees this appeal, please get in touch to confirm that you are safe and well.’

Esme was last seen by her friends when she left All Hallows Catholic School in Farnham at around 3.15pm last Thursday.

She told them that she was travelling to Woking and would then be going on to a party.

But the brunette boarded a train at Aldershot station just after 4pm and was then filmed on CCTV getting off a train at London Waterloo around 5pm.

Police have issued several photographs of the teenager and a spokesman for the Surrey force said: ‘Esme is described  as white, 5ft 3in tall, slim to medium build, with shoulder-length brown hair that may be tied in a bun.

‘She has brown eyes and a tanned complexion and wears size six shoes.’

Officers have launched a ‘Twitter reconstruction’, using the social networking site to post details of the teenager’s last known movements along with pictures of her in the hope of jogging people’s memories.

Police said that although she may be in London they are also considering the possibility that she may have moved on to somewhere outside the capital.

Anyone with information should call Surrey Police on 101 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
