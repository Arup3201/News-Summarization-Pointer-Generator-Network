A brave little boy born with his intestines on the outside of his body has  celebrated his fourth birthday by swimming in the pool for the very first time.

Jaylen Cornish, from Victoria, was born with gastroschisis, a condition which means his intestine formed outside his bowel, meaning he is unable to eat or drink.

The little blue-eyed fighter spent the first two years of his life in hospital, and so for his mum Katie, this moment was a big step for both of them.

Clad in a $600 'dry' wetsuit specially designed for him, Jaylen had his first taste of the pool when he fearlessly plunged into the water with the aid of his mum

'The surgeon said to me look it's a lot worse than what we thought it was,' Ms Cornish said.

'They said we're not sure whether he's going to survive the operation.'

The condition affects one in 4,000 children, and was picked up very early on in Ms Cornish when she had her 14 week scan, reported The Herald Sun.

Jaylen was taken from her soon after he was born and underwent ten operations to remove dead part of his intestines and insert feeding tubes. 

His body needs to be kept dry so that there is no risk of infection, a mammoth task which Ms Cornish tackles alone as a single single parent

'He has got an opportunity in life to do things he has never been able to do before. Swimming is a big thing,' Ms Cornish said

In total, Jaylen has had 22 operations and has only spent six months of his life away from hospital.

'We’ve nearly lost him, but he's come out battling, he’s the strongest boy I’ve ever known,' said Ms Cornish.

'Every time we go past a pool or whatever he will start pointing and say 'mummy I want to go swimming, mummy water,' Ms Cornish told 9 News.

'He has got an opportunity in life to do things he has never been able to do before. Swimming is a big thing,' she said.

'I think this is the best gift that anyone could ever ask for.'

Jaylen's condition means that his life has been filled with hospital visits, supported by his devoted mum who moved from Yarra Junction to Oakleigh to be closer to Monash Children's Hospital where Jaylen receives life-saving aid.

The four-year-old requires constant care, and relies on tubes inserted into his body which pass essential fluids and nutrients to keep him healthy and happy.
