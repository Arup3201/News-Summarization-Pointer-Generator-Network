She never minced words...it was her trademark. 

And at the height of the miners’ strike the stage was set for Margaret Thatcher’s hardest-hitting speech yet.

For the Tory Party conference in 1984, her writers had drafted a damning critique of Labour’s unwillingness to condemn picket-line violence during the bitter year-long conflict, thuggery she described as a ‘dark shadow’ over our free country.

But before she could deliver the strident words, a more sinister shadow fell.

Margaret Thatcher had planned to savage Labour with a hard-hitting speech at the 1984 Tory party conference (left) but was forced to change the nature of her address after the IRA bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton (right). The papers featuring her original speech have now been released by the Margaret Thatcher Archive Trust

The never-seen-before papers from the former Prime Minister's personal file in 1984 show her first attempts at writing her Conservative party speech

Her original speech accuses the Labour leadership of sympathising with militant miners and trade unionists and sanctioning their breaking of the law

Chris Collins of the Thatcher Foundation said it would have been a ‘great’ speech and more controversial than her ‘enemy within’ address to the 1922 Committee of Tories in July 1984

On the day she was due to address colleagues at the Brighton Centre, her hotel, the Grand, was hit by an IRA bomb. Five Tory colleagues were killed and others seriously injured.

As the nation reeled at such an attack on the heart of Government, the Prime Minister famously insisted on continuing with the party conference agenda, but with a radically revised speech to declare Britain’s defiance in the face of terror.

Now the original text, which historians believe would have eclipsed her address branding miners the ‘enemy within’ a few months earlier – has been revealed in her personal papers from 1984, which are held at Churchill College, Cambridge and released today by the Margaret Thatcher Archive Trust.

It accuses the Labour leadership of sympathising with militant miners and trade unionists and sanctioning their breaking the law. She was set to accuse the party's leader Neil Kinnock of being 'a puppet' of the militants - unprepared to face them down.

It reads: ‘From this dark cloud falls an acid rain that eats into liberty. It can be seen above all in the natural home that these views and voices now find in the Labour Party.

‘It explains why that party is so muted in its condemnation of picket violence; so muted in its praise for the hard-pressed police; so muted in its advocacy of an NUM [National Union of Mineworkers] ballot.’

The draft of Mrs Thatcher's address was written following the previous week's Labour Party conference, which had been dominated by the miners' strike.

The then Prime Minister intended to accuse Mr Kinnock of vainly trying to convince his party that it should try to win power 'through the ballot box, not through insurrection'.

She was to add: 'Mr Kinnock’s own words… show just how far the enemies of democracy have advanced inside the modern Labour party. Mr Kinnock, for all his words – and there is no shortage of those – has been hijacked, first by Mr Scargill, then by the anti-democrats at his own party conference. In name he may be leader. In reality he is a puppet.'

The Prime Minister had just survived an assassination attempt and was grieving for colleagues who were not so lucky. 

But while battling to hold together a party and a nation in shock, Mrs Thatcher also remembered to cancel a hair appointment. 

After briefing her secretary to let local stylist William Thorne know she would not be coming, she wrote to him herself to thank him for his work on her hair earlier in the week. 

‘The fact that it lasted so well through Friday [when the bomb hit] was the real test,’ she told Mr Thorne.

Her private secretary John Coles later wrote to Mrs Thatcher, saying: ‘We shall remember not the bomb or the ruined building but your courage, calm and nobility in the aftermath.’

In the aftermath of the IRA bombing in Brighton, Margaret Thatcher still managed to remember to call her stylist and cancel an upcoming hair appointment

In newly-released letters from Downing Street, the former Prime Minister wrote to her stylist,  Mr Thorne, apologising that she had to cancel in the wake of the tragedy

The conference came just months after the Battle of Orgreave in South Yorkshire, on June 18, when thousands of police and striking miners clashed. Dozens on both sides were injured.

Mrs Thatcher’s speech describes the Labour Party as being ‘infiltrated by extremists, riven with factions’, adding: ‘We meet today as free people in a free country. 

'But every one of us here senses the shadow that has fallen across this freedom since last we met.

‘The shadow I speak of is the violence and intimidation which has scarred and wrecked the coal industry, and particularly the working miners and their families.

‘The shadow grows darker as influential men and women in our society question, even repudiate, the ideas of parliamentary democracy and the rule of law.’

The speech was torn into sections and later taped back together – possibly by the Iron Lady herself.

In her 1984 Conservative party conference speech (above), Margaret Thatcher instead chose to condemn the IRA and declare Britain's defiance in the face of terror

The Grand Hotel in Brighton was hit by an IRA bomb in October 1984 in an attempt to kill Thatcher and her Cabinet. It killed five people and injured a further 30

She narrowly avoided death in the IRA attack, as the blast hit her bathroom. 

Following the bombing in the early hours, she toned down her script. The resulting words, spoken just hours later, were much more conciliatory and she paid tribute to those killed.

Chris Collins of the Thatcher Foundation said it would have been a ‘great’ speech and more controversial than her ‘enemy within’ address to the 1922 Committee of Tories in July 1984. 

The original text shows she was prepared to go further and launch an all-out offensive on Labour.

Mr Collins said: ‘She would have taken some convincing to deliver such an attack on Labour and only done so with extreme provocation as such partisan politics were against her nature … [It] would have defined her career.’

Margaret Thatcher once faced a diplomatic row about roses.

The incident, which saw the UK mediate between Germany and Japan over who could name a rose after her, stretches for more than 40 pages in her 1984 files.

The Tory leader was asked by the German Central Horticultural Association if it could name a flower in her honour. 

She said she was ‘deeply touched’, adding in a nod to her party’s colours: ‘A blue rose would be too much to expect.’

But she had forgotten that in 1978 she gave permission for a Margaret Thatcher rose to be created by Japanese firm Takatori. After a series of memos, it was eventually decided the Japanese should be appeased.
