A New Orleans woman has spoken out after being drugged at a celebrity hot spot and waking up the following day to learn she had not only gone home with one man, she had also had sex with two others.

Maria Treme's ordeal happened on June 30 after she went to The Country Club, a Bywater hot spot where A-listers Beyonce, Jay Z and Solange, partied less than a month later. 

Ms Tremem 30, had gone to the venue to drink with a girlfriend, and had sunbathed naked, which the club allows. But after five hours beside the pool and $36 worth of drinks she blacked out.

Maria Treme, 30, said she woke up with bruised thighs and immediately knew she had been 'roofied'

The next day, she told WWL-TV, she woke up with bruises on her inner thighs and a lubricant beside her bed which she had never seen before. Her car keys were also gone.

She said: 'I didn't know where they came from and I immediately knew I was roofied because I know how much I had to drink, I know how much I can drink and there was zero memory, nothing.'

Accompanied by a friend, she went back to the club where she watched security footage to help her piece together what had happened the night before.

What she saw and heard from eyewitnesses shocked her.

As well as signing a much larger bar tab and shouting at a bar tender, she learned that she had had sex with one man in the pool, another in the sauna, and had gone home with a third man dressed only in a towel. 

Ms Treme isn't claiming all the the men raped her, and only wants to find the person who drugged her.

She said: 'I'm kind-of of the opinion that if there's three innocent people and one that's not, I'm not gonna take down the three innocent people because this one person wants to be a sicko, you know?'

According to authorities, drug rape is common in New Orleans, which has a culture of heavy drinking. 

Leah Foster, director of Trauma Recovery Services at New Orleans Family Justice Center, said the crime wasn't necessarily on the rise, but was receiving far more publicity. 

One high profile case involves former Saints star Darren Sharper who is accused of drugging and raping women in New Orleans and in four other states.

But unlike in the Sharper case, where he is accused of using drugs that incapacitated the woman involved, Ms Treme is believed to have been drugged with a substance that simply makes its victims forget what they've done. All traces of it, also disappear from the body within 12 hours.

Ms Treme said: 'That's where it gets tricky because, I mean, I saw myself on video walking out of there, laughing and waving to the bartender, stumbling out of there, and, you know, this guy's drunk, I appear to be drunk and I just don't think it would be right for me to say everybody raped me.'

Ms Treme is also angry at the way the New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) handled her case. By the time they took her to hospital for testing, it was too late for doctors to find traces of the drug used in her system.

Ms Foster said 'the number one thing' anyone suspected of being raped should do, is get to the hospital immediately.  

The NOPD defended its decision to gather more evidence before taking Ms Treme to the hospital. 

A police spokesman said that's standard procedure for such an investigation and said the department wants to keep working with Ms Treme. 

Ginesse Barrett, a forensic nurse at Interim LSU Hospital's SAFE unit, says sex predators often use GHB, or LIquid X, which can be made at home and only stays in a victim's system for 12 hours. The drug is known to lower peoples inhibitions. 

Another factor in the case is that New Orleans police also has a bad reputation for solving sex crimes. Reported rape cares there are far below any other U.S. city with a major crime problem. And a survey of 90 sex crimes in the area last year found nearly half of them had been mischaracterized as lesser offenses.

Ms Treme said she has received a lot of support from women friends who say they had experienced similar things, but she is also getting criticized for not pursuing charges against all of the men she had sex with.   

Sarah Ney, The Country Club's vice president and attorney, told WWL-TV that the club has very strict rules against sex on the premises and works hard to protect its clients.
