Commuters heading to work in London this morning were baffled by the sight of a woman 'walking' a man on all fours.

With a collar round his neck and a pink lead, the man was smartly dressed in suit trousers, white shirt and black shoes as he meekly crawled after the woman through the streets of Farringdon, in the centre of the capital.

Onlookers suspected it was a PR stunt but the woman, who was also smartly dressed and carried a cup of coffee in her other hand, was giving nothing away.

Twitter users posted pictures of the unusual pair onto the social media site, where some debated the reason behind the stunt.

One user, a spoof Ed Balls account, suggested: 'I bet this guy didn't empty the washing machine to the agreed standard', while others suggested it was a lost bet or penance.

Another merely asked: 'Do we know what they were advertising yet?'
