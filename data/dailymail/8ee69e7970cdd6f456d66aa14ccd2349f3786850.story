A great grandmother has called in police after being plagued by anonymous letters criticising her appearance and calling her a 'council house hussy'.

Margaret Kitching, 76, says the poison pen letters, one of which is typed and the others handwritten, started when she rejoined a pensioners' club in her home village of Ardsley, near Barnsley, South Yorkshire.

The retired dinner lady called in police after receiving four letters taunting her about her appearance and calling on her to leave the Over-55s club which meets fortnightly at the Oaks Working Men's Club near her home.

Devil symbol: The first letter arrived last November, when Mrs Kitching had let her club attendance lapse

Officers have taken fingerprints from the letters and have asked all members of the club, which Mrs Kitching has recently started attending again after lapsing for a while, for samples of their handwriting.

The first letter, which was typed, arrived at the bungalow Mrs Kitching shares with husband Ken, 81, last November, the day after she had had an operation which meant she hadn't attended the club for a while.

It read: 'We are all glad you have left the club.  You are a mouthy, vindictive council hussy.  You can take the hussy out of a council house but you cannot take the council house woman and make her a silk purse!!!' 

And the letter ended with a devil symbol.

Determined not to let the anonymous bully win, Mrs Kitching, who has three children, three grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren, started going to the club again.  There are 23 members, all of them women in their 60s and 70s, and they organise events and trips including bingo, day trips to the seaside, quizzes and guest speakers.

This February a second letter arrived, this one handwritten.  It read: 'Some of us are not best pleased that you are back (55s), you always was bolshi [sic] and liked your own way even at school.

'You are like mutton dressed as lamb in your charity shop clothes.'

In June a third letter, also handwritten, and riddled with spelling mistakes, arrived for Mrs Kitching.

Calling her a 'harridan', it said: 'You are cheap as chips with your cheap jewellery.  Your hair looks as though it has been cut with a knife and fork.' 

Then a fourth, handwritten, letter arrived, purporting to be from someone else as it begins: 'Hi, it's my turn.'

The letter goes on: 'You would be surprised at what we get to know about you' and continues by calling Mrs Kitching a 'selfish gobby b****' and telling her to 'keep away' from the club where she has served on the committee.

One of the letters ended with three kisses, while others included personal comments about Mrs Kitching's husband and relatives. 

Mrs Kitching said: 'Some of the things in the letters are unbelievable - they are absolutely horrible and really upsetting.

'I think there is a jealous person behind all this, but it's caused me real heartache and sleepless nights, as well as stress. 

'When I go out of my home I am always looking over my shoulder, wondering if the perpetrator is following me like a stalker.' 

She believes the sender of the letters is not a member of the club, but someone in the village, possibly a former member of the club or someone who knows one.'

The former dinner lady has called in police and says she has her suspicions about who the culprit may be

'They say things like no-one likes me, and talk about my buying things from charity shops. It is running me down.

'When I first got the letters I said I wasn't going to the club any more, but my friend said if I stopped going then this person had won. So I'm still going.'

She said other people in the area unconnected with the over-55s club had received similar poison pen letters about four years ago.

'One neighbour came to read my letters and he said straight away it was the same handwriting as on the letters he received all that time ago.'

One 79-year-old club member said: 'We just haven't a clue where these letters are coming from.

'I can't believe it is a member of our club. We sit and chat, have a game of dominoes or bingo and wile away a couple of hours. We also arrange outings - they are a nice set of ladies.

'I have seen the letters and they are quite nasty and very personal. It is obviously somebody that knows Margaret well who is very vindictive.'

Mrs Kitching said: 'It is definitely somebody who knows me and my family really well. I have my suspicions but I can't prove anything. If I had anything to say to someone I would say it to their face. I can't understand it.'

A South Yorkshire Police spokesman said: 'We have received reports of a 76-year-old woman receiving distressing letters from an unknown person. Officers are continuing their inquiries.'
