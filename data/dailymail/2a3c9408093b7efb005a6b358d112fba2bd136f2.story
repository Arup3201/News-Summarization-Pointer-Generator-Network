Squatters who have moved into a high-value property which belongs to a high street banking giant have described it as the 'best squat ever'.

The group of nine - including students and those 'in-between jobs' - said the building was used by Lloyds Banking Group as a private bank.

The 3,500 square foot property on Pembroke Road in Bristol spreads over four floors and includes large rooms with high ceilings, a kitchen, a lift and a staircase with wood and ironwork railings.

A number of the elegant rooms in the 
unfurnished building have been transformed into bedrooms, and a sofa and
garden furniture have been placed in a conservatory attached to the 
building.

The squatters, aged between 20 and 50,
believe the property would cost approximately £81,000 a year in rent 
plus more than £40,000 in business tax.

Properties on Pembroke Road that have not been split into flats sell in the region of £1 million, the squatters said.

The group has hung two large posters on the outside of the property that read 'best squat evah!' and 'another banking mess up!'.

'Better than a sleeping bag on a park bench': One squatter said it was nice to be able to show that buildings like this can be used in a positive fashion

They gained entry to the building, 
which is classed as a commercial property, through an open window in the
early hours of Sunday morning.

The group, who had previously squatted
in an empty post office in Bristol city centre, were evicted from the 
building two weeks ago.

The 
former bank, which is believed to have been empty for around a year, is 
still connected to both water and electricity, although the internal 
lift has broken down.

Lloyds Banking Group confirmed it is their building.

Police attended to inspect the 
property, but left after confirming no damage had been caused, that it 
was a commercial property, and that the occupation was a civil matter.

The high life: The squatters believe the property would cost around £81,000 a year in rent plus more than £40,000 in business tax

Squatter Simon Jones, 42, who has 
lived in Bristol for the last three years, said: 'We noticed the 
building a few weeks ago. We were evicted from our previous place and it
was too good an opportunity to miss.

'We were last in an industrial unit, it was a bit cold, it’s somewhat nicer here.

'This is property owned by Lloyds TSB,
private banking. It used to be one of their private banking offices and
Lloyds TSB, being 46% owned by taxpayers, they from here advised high 
yield individuals, specialising in offshore accounts, advising 
individuals wishing to invest between £2million and £20million offshore.

'And while the bankers are still getting bonuses, there are homeless people like us that are trying to get secure accommodation.

'We are just looking for somewhere to 
live and as a group of homeless people we’re enjoying getting one back 
at the financial system which always seems to get public money thrown at
it when they’re in trouble.'

Bank bashers: The group has hung two large posters on the outside of the property that read 'best squat evah!' and 'another banking mess up!'

Nothing to see here: Police attended to inspect the property, but left after confirming no damage had been caused said the occupation was a civil matter

Another squatter, Barry Fry, 34, 
added: 'Obviously it’s a massive upgrade from having a sleeping bag on a
park bench and is nice because of who the owners are and the way it was
being used before.

'It’s just nice to be able to show that buildings like this can be used in a positive fashion.'

The squatters expect to be in the 
building for three to four weeks and have been reassuring their new 
neighbours that their stay is temporary.

'The ones that have come up to us have been quite supportive,' Mr Jones said.

'We’re not going to be partying or causing a nuisance or an annoyance while we are here.

'In Bristol you have one in five shops
or commercial premises that are empty, that seems to increase by the 
month, they could be put to use to house homeless people.'

He added he would like to see a 
greater understanding of how easy it is to lose a house and become 
homeless and for more compassion to be shown towards squatters.

Changing rooms: Many of the large empty offices have been been or will be converted into bedrooms

Money matters: The squatters said the bank used to specialise in offshore accounts, advising clients wishing to invest between £2m and £20m

Squatters have occupied a number of buildings in Bristol, including the £3 million mansion, Clifton Wood House.

A new law came into force last month 
that means that people who occupy residential properties without 
permission could be jailed for six months and/or be fined up to £5,000, 
as it is now a criminal offence in England and Wales.

In the past, squatting was a civil matter, and the police were only called if criminality was suspected.

The squatters said the property in 
Pembroke Road is classed as a commercial property and therefore is not 
affected by the new law.

'It is worrying that last week a 
21-year-old man in London was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison for 
squatting in a residential property,' Mr Jones said.

'But this is a commercial building. Factories, warehouses, pubs, offices have been excluded in the consultation.'

Mr Fry added: 'I think that’s 
something that’s going to get worse in the next six to 12 months, with 
the changes to benefits, under 25s not being able to apply, the age 
limit being raised from 30 to 35 with regards to single occupancy, and 
that sort of thing, but also generally as the cuts start to kick in it 
will start to drag more and more people into this kind of situation.'
