Day in court: The Sydney socialite and fashion designer faced court in August over drinking driving charges, after she rolled her Range Rover in Bondi in June and recorded a blood alcohol level 0.181. She was banned from driving for 12 months and received a $1,100 fine. No conviction was recorded

Police have confirmed officers arrested a man in his fifties at a Point Piper home in Sydney in the early hours of Monday before charging him with assault. 

According to Channel Nine, the incident allegedly occurred after the former wife of billionaire James Packer discovered text messages on 53-year-old Jon Stevens' phone. 

The Daily Telegraph reported the messages were in emails and were from an ex-girlfriend.

Jodhi is alleged to have sustained minor injuries on her wrist.

The New Zealand-born star was released on bail and is reportedly set to appear in Waverley Local Court relating to the incident on Thursday.

The Sydney Morning Herald reported police were called to the couple's exclusive Point Piper home after the alleged fight and immediately issued an interim AVO, forbidding the Jezebal hitmaker from going near Jodhi for 28 days. 

The former INXS rocker was arrested and charged with assault. It is believed the AVO could be dropped.

The rocker had been due to play several gigs this week, including Rooty Hill RSL on Friday night and Revesby Workers Club on Saturday night, but the shows have now been cancelled, with concert-goers offered refunds.

The assault is the second incident for Jodhi in just eight months after she rolled her Range Rover in Bondi in June last year, recording a blood alcohol level of 0.181.

Incident: In court at the time of the hearing to make a decision on Meares' sentence, her lawyer said the former model weighed about 48.5 kilograms and had drunk 'about four and three-quarter' glasses of red wine over four and a half hours and eaten just a small piece of lamb when she got behind the wheel

Bikini babe: Jodhi rose to fame as a swimsuit model, and eventually went on to design them with her label Tigerlily, which she founded in 2000 and eventually sold to Billabong in 2007 for an estimated $3 - $5 million

Jodhi, who formerly founded swimwear label Tigerlily, has worked to create a life for herself with the sportswear label The Upside.

She sold Tigerlily, the swimwear label she founded in 2000 during her marriage to Packer, to surfwear giant Billabong in 2007 for an amount reported to be between $3 and $5 million, staying on as a consultant before eventually cutting ties. 

But her recent court case also shone a light on how her new fashion label is struggling to make money, despite its popularity among style-loving Sydney-siders.

Jodhi's lawyer Mr Chris Murphy said she had not made any money from The Upside, had had to pay staff for taking maternity leave and had given any profits to the Cambodian Children's Trust, a Cambodian orphans charity.

'Every garment that is sold by that business, a payment is made to the Cambodian trust,' he said.'In this particular situation she has a business which is in its early stages, but it doesn't make money - but the cheque goes to the Cambodian orphanage ... with the slum children.' 

The Upside enjoyed a moment in the spotlight at the recent David Jones fashion parade,
