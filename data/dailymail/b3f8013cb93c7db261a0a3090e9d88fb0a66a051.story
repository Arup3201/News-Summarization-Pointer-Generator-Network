Britain's highest court is to debate whether soldiers in battle have the right to life, has been claimed.  

The Supreme Court will investigate circumstances surrounding the death of Private Phillip Hewett in Iraq in July 2005 and examine whether troops in war zones are covered by the part of the European Convention on Human Rights that protects the right to life, The Independent said.

Private Hewett's mother Sue Smith has fought for justice since the 21-year-old was blown up along with two colleagues from the Staffordshire Regiment in a roadside bomb attack on their armoured Snatch Land Rover.

Ongoing battle: Pte Hewett, one of the three soldiers from the Staffordshire regiment killed on patrol in Iraq. His mother, Sue Smith, has taken her case to the Supreme Court

In October the lower Court of Appeal ruled that relatives of soldiers who had been killed in action could pursue claims on grounds of negligence - but not make claims for damages under human rights legislation.

The judges accepted the Government's 
assertion that the battlefield was beyond the reach of litigation but 
the families' lawyers said the fight would go on and they would take the
human rights battle to the Supreme Court.

Determined: Sue Smith, Pte Hewett's mother, said it was 'disgusting' that Iraqi citizens were afforded rights that British soldiers were not

Ms Smith, 51, of Tamworth, Staffordshire, said outside the court: 'It is just so dismissive. It 'doesn't matter'. They are Action Men. If you break them, just bury them. But they are not just Action Men. People need to make a stand.'

Currently servicemen and women on bases in Afghanistan are covered by human-rights law, but this protection dissipates as soon as they walk out of the gates.

But, last year the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg ruled that Iraqi citizens killed when the UK was effectively the occupying force in southern Iraq were protected by the European convention.

Speaking to The Independent, Ms Smith's solicitor Jocelyn Cockburn, said the law protected Iraqi citizens better than British soldiers. 'It is anomalous that, as the law currently stands, soldiers are capable of bringing others within UK jurisdiction but they are not within it themselves.

'We afford Iraqi citizens rights of protection which we cannot even give to our own soldiers.'

She said she hoped the Strasbourg ruling would strengthen Ms Smith's argument before the Supreme Court which is believed to take place before seven judges in February.

Ms Smith, a community care worker, 
has accused the Ministry of Defence of breaching its duty of care by 
making British troops use the poorly protected Snatch vehicles in Iraq.

She
told The Independent: 'Sometimes I feel the Government is in control of
everything and that I am fighting a system that everybody works for. It
is nice to know I might have a chance.

'I find it disgusting that we employ soldiers to defend our country and send them out without any human rights, yet we criticise other countries for not honouring their human rights.'

John Wadham, general counsel for the Equality and Human Rights Commission, told The Independent that the section of the ECHR in question, Article 2, did not offer absolute protection but simply placed a responsibility on the state to protect life in the context of the situation.
