Britney Spears may have a new brunette hairdo, but she had something of a blonde moment on Sunday night when she wrongly credited the designer of her dress.

When asked by WWD who had made her plunging black sequin gown at Elton John's Oscars viewing party, the singer, 31, replied that it was a Versace design.

In fact, though, it was a creation by Michael Cinco Couture - and it was only thanks to Ms Spears' publicist that the correction was made afterwards.

Of course Ms Spears no doubt has a stylist to handle all sartorial matters for her - but it still comes as some surprise that she does not know which label was generous enough to loan her a garment worth at least a four-figure sum.

Beyoncé, for example, will dry clean loaned items after wearing then, sending them back to the designer with a hand-written thank-you note, revealed Rubin Singer who has made stage costumes for her in the past.

At the other end of the spectrum is Lindsay Lohan, who apparently ripped and then took a pair of scissors to a borrowed gown by Theia Couture earlier this month.

A source told Us Weekly: 'She said that the dress had ripped... She couldn’t possibly wear it like that - 
so her stylist friend went to the club bouncer and requested some 
scissors to repair the torn part of the dress. She turned it into a mullet!'

Ms Spears, who is newly-single after splitting from fiancé Jason Trawick, looked sensational at the event on Sunday, which was also attended by Emma Roberts, Nicki Minaj and Anna Paquin.

Since her break-up, the mother-of-two is believed to have started dating a man named David who does field research for a law firm.
