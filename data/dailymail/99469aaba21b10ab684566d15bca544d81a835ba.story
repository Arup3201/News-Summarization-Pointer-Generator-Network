Covered in desert dust and with a beaming smile for the camera, Raffaele Sollecito looks like a man who has had the weight of the world lifted off his shoulders in pictures taken at the 'Burning Man' festival.

The ex-boyfriend of Amanda Knox attended the famous Nevada counter-culture event earlier this month ahead of a tiring schedule of television promotions for his new book which lifts the lid on his doomed relationship with the American student and their acquittal for the murder of Meredith Kercher last year.

And despite being a self-confessed smoker of cannabis, Sollecito denied taking part in any nefarious activities while at the Black Rock Desert festival and the pictures suggest the Italian seemed to enjoy the massive week-long open air party.

Posting over 200 pictures of his time at
the 'Burning Man' festival to his Facebook page, Sollecito made sure 
his fiends were kept up to date of his partying exploits.

'I'm good safe and reborn and I got no acid and no drugs at all. I repeat: emotions are my drugs,' said Sollecito on his page.

'This is a powerful experience, I will be back again.'

Despite blending anonymously into the annual free-spirited event, Sollecito, 28, has now arrived in New York City, where he will be interviewed exclusively by Katie Couric this month to discuss the revelations in 'Honour Bound: My Journey to Hell and Back with Amanda Knox'.

Stopping to have his shoes shined on the streets of Manhattan, Sollecito took a tour around the Big Apple before beginning media training for the promotion of his book which is on general release from September 18th.

Raffaele Sollecito was convicted alongside Knox in 2009 of killing Miss Kercher but the pair were freed last October after their convictions 
were overturned due to a lack of evidence.

Attending the massive 50,000 person open air desert festival, Sollecito looks a different person from the troubled soul who appeared in court last year

The annual counter-culture festival relies on a system of barter-trade and not money to purchase goods and services while at the event

Raffaele Sollecito seemed to really get into the spirit of things at the Burning Man festival

Miss Kercher, a 21-year-old from Leeds University, was found 
semi-naked and with her throat cut in a house she shared with Knox in Perugia, Italy, in November 2007.

And in his new book, 'Honour Bound: My Journey to Hell and Back with Amanda Knox', Sollecito talks openly about the early days of his relationship with the American that sparked such fervid speculation over their involvement in the crime.

In it, he maintains
the couple's innocence but acknowledges that their sometimes 'bizarre 
behaviour' after Miss Kercher's death gave police reason for 
suspicion.

He describes how their romance 
became a nightmare with the horror of Miss Kercher's death, the 
misunderstandings that swept them up in the case, and their tabloid 
portrayals as two suspects unrecognisable to themselves.

Indeed since the pairs acquittal in October of 2011, Sollecito has traveled to Seattle to meet up with his ex-girlfriend and even thought about moving to the city for a job with technology giants Microsoft earlier this year.

Despite speculation that the couple would reunite following their almost four-year separation, they both seem to have moved on with different partners.

Raffaele Sollecito has now arrived in New York to promote his new book and to appear on Katie Couric's television program

Before the trial: U.S. citizen Amanda Knox, left, and 
her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, of Italy, outside the rented 
house where 21-year-old British student Meredith Kercher was found dead in 2007

Knox, 24, is now seeing longtime friend James Terrano, a 25-year-old 
musician, while Mr Sollecito was in a relationship with an Italian volleyball 
player, Annie Achille, but now lists himself as single.

During the investigation and trial into Miss Kercher's death Knox 
became 'Foxy Knoxy' and received the brunt of the attention as she 
shopped for underwear after the killing and turned cartwheels in front 
of investigators.

Sollecito recounts in his book how he met Knox at a classical music concert in Perugia before going on to spend the night with her.

Within a week, Miss Kercher was murdered and the couple fell instantly under the spotlight of suspicion.

In the hours after the gruesome 
murder scene was discovered, the duo was notoriously photographed 
kissing and cuddling in the street outside while police investigated.

Italian authorities 
later described Sollecito’s behaviour ass ‘odd’, and acknowledged the two had 
no real alibi 'except each other.'

Murder charges: Raffaele Sollecito, left, and 
Amanda Knox, right, are pictured arriving for a hearing in Perugia's 
court, in 2009; in Sollecito's book, he maintains his innocence but says
he and his then-girlfriend behaved oddly

They eventually told police that they had been smoking marijuana and having sex in Sollecito's apartment before falling asleep.

The pair was imprisoned days after 
the November 1, 2007 death of Kercher in the central Italian city. Both 
would remain there for nearly four years.

Brutal murder: Meredith Kercher was killed in her apartment on November 1, 2007

An
appeals court overturned their conviction and freed them last fall, 
issuing a 143-page opinion that blasted the utter lack of evidence 
against them.

Rudy Guede, a petty criminal who was convicted separately, remains imprisoned and is serving a 16-year-sentence.

In
this book, he describes how the early days of their relationship became a
nightmare: the horror of Kercher's slaying; the misunderstandings that 
swept them up in the case.

While
police investigated the crime scene, Sollecito caressed her and they 
kissed, unaware of the television news cameras across the street.

Later at the police station she climbed in his lap and draped her arms over him, making Sollecito uneasy, he said.

Knox is also writing a book, due out next spring. Her deal, with HarperCollins, is reportedly worth $4 million.

The
couple were arrested several days after Kercher's death and later 
convicted in proceedings that made headlines around the world.

Prosecutors portrayed the case as a 
drug-fuelled sexual assault, and Knox and Sollecito were sentenced to 26
years and 25 years, respectively.

Anxious moments: Raffaele Sollecito waits in 
Perugia's Court of Appeal before hearing that he won his appeal against 
his murder conviction on October 3, 2011 in Italy

Testifying: Sollecito testified during a session of Knox's appeal trial in Perugia's courthouse on June 27, 2011

The
appeals court found the prosecution's theory to be unsupported by any 
evidence.

Prosecutors have appealed the acquittal, and Italy's highest 
court will hear their arguments next March.

Sollecito
frequently criticizes the police for their handling of the case, 
reaching for a far-fetched conspiracy instead of the simpler explanation
that Guede had on his own committed a burglary gone wrong.

Sollecito, then finishing his 
undergraduate studies in computer science, writes that he met Knox at a 
classical music concert at the Universita per Stranieri, the University 
for Foreigners, on October 25, 2007 - a week before Kercher's death.

He asked for her number, and she told him to come by the bar where she'd be working later that night.

At
the end of the shift, he writes, they took a walk, held hands and 
kissed. She accepted an invitation to come back to his apartment and 
spent the night.

Release: Knox, pictured right at Rome's airport,

Washington, left, a day after she was acquitted of murder in October 
2011

Soon the 
couple became inseparable. She began spending the nights at his 
apartment. They shopped for groceries together, and took a sightseeing 
day trip to Assisi.

Sollecito wrote about his first night
in prison, saying he wavered between 'great waves of indignation and a 
nagging sense of guilt.' 

He
said that while he knew he was innocent, he was angry at himself for 
having a foggy memory of the night of the killing because he and Knox 
had smoked marijuana.

Moving on: Knox, pictured in March with her 
boyfriend James Terrano, are both living in Seattle; Knox has her own 
book deal, rumoured to be worth $4million

When 
they were finally acquitted, Sollecito writes that he felt 
'indescribable joy.' He remembers looking at the police, hoping to see 
them appear defeated, but they wouldn't look at him. 

He
saw Knox sobbing, and they later had a private moment in the basement 
of the courthouse, waiting to be taken back to prison one last time.

According to Sollecito, she squeezed his hand and said she couldn't wait to see her home and friends.

Knox moved back to Seattle, and has since been pictured adjusting to life back in the States.
