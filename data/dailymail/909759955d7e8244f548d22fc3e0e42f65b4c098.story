It was a busy day for Toronto Mayor Rob Ford who started out ranting about oral sex, only to apologize for his 'graphic language' at another press conference held hours later.

Earlier today, the mayor announced he would be suing ex-staffers Mark Towhey, Issac Ransom and George Christopoulos after they told police they witnessed Ford hanging out with prostitutes as well as abusing alcohol and prescription pills like OxyContin.

He also said he would be suing the waiter of an upscale Toronto restaurant who said the mayor snorted cocaine in the establishment.

Bad words: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford used some pretty graphic language to describe allegations he made sexual advances on a staffer, Olivia Gondek

Allegations that he made sexual advances towards staffer Olivia Gondek seemed to anger the mayor the most.

'It says that I wanted to eat her p****. I would never do that. I'm happily married. I've got more than enough to eat at home, thank you very much,' he said.

At noon, the mayor held yet another press conference backed by his wife Renata to apologize for his 'graphic language' blaming the 'impulse in my remarks' on the last six months of 'tremendous stress'.

'The revelations yesterday of cocaine, escorts and prostitution have pushed me over the line,' he said. 'I used unforgivable language.'

Ford has been married to his wife Renata Brejniak since 2000. They met in high school and have two children together, daughter Stephanie and son Doug.

Ford added that yesterday's City Council vote that he take time off to deal with his personal life was the second worst day of his life, after the death of his father.

Since the City Council doesn't have the power to kick Ford out of the job, the decision was non-binding and Ford ultimately refused to step down.

'I'm not an addict of any sort. So I'm not quite sure why you're saying I need help,' Ford said after the vote.

What stress? In his noon press conference today, Ford blamed the tremendous stress' of the past six months for his indecent language referring to alleged sexual advances on a staffer. Pictured at City Hall later, he looked at ease

Straightening out: Ford said he was seeking help from 'healthcare professionals' but would not elaborate what type of treatment he is receiving

But today's second press conference was the first time Ford seemed at all remorseful for his behavior.

He announced that he was 'getting support' from 'healthcare professionals' but wouldn't detail what kind of help.

Ford said he was 'taking accountability' for his actions and 'accepting responsibility for challenges I face'.

While
 those statements seem an admission of guilt, the mayor continued to 
deny the allegations in the police report saying they are '100 per cent 
lies'.

He has previously stated his plans to run for reelection in October 2014.

During yesterday's City Council meating, hundreds of protesters gathered outside City Hall, many of them calling on Ford to step down.

An
 Ipsos-Reid poll conducted for several TV and radio stations showed that
 76 percent of Toronto voters think Ford should step down or take a 
leave of absence, while only 24 percent agreed with Ford's insistence on
 staying in his job.

Rob Ford's wife Renata Brejniak stood by her man today as he apologized for the 'graphic language' he used to describe allegations he made sexual advances towards a staffer.

Not much is known about Renata, even to people within the Ford circle. She has been described as the 'invisible wife' and an 'enigma' by Toronto Life Magazine.

The couple met in high school when they were only living a few blocks from each other, and got married in 2000. They have an 8-year old daughter, Stephanie, and a 5-year-old son, Douglas.

Doug Holyday, Ford's former deputy mayor was at their wedding held at St George's Golf and Country Club.

'I don't even know if she has a job,' he told Toronto Life.

The Ford marriage has been far from perfect. In 2008, a domestic dispute started between the two when Ford called the police because of his wife's 'irrational, out-of-control' behavior.

When police 'saw the situation' they informed him to leave with the children so he took them to his mother's house.

Television crews covering the dispute showed up to Ford's parents house where he used daughter Stephanie to deflect questions about the fight. He held her up in the front door and she said 'no comment' to the reporters gathered outside. 

The next day, Ford returned to his house to take a shower and change clothes and that's when Renata called police.

Ford was arrested and charged with assaulting his wife and threatening to kill her.

At the time, a neighbor described Mrs Ford to the Globe and Mail as 'reclusive and rarely seen out of the house'

The charges were eventually dropped due to 'credibility issues' on Renata's part.

The couple seemed to patch things up after the incident.

'Everything's going great...whatever it takes,' Ford said when he finally returned to his home. 'I support my wife. My wife supports me.'

Renata rarely gives interviews. A June 2013 Toronto Sun article about the first-lady of Toronto references the last time she spoke to the press - October 25, 2010 when Ford was elected mayor.

Renata was helping her husband out at the time, returning calls when one reporter got a rare opportunity to chat with the first lady of Toronto. When asked about their children, Renata says they try to shelter Stephanie and Doug from politics.

'We have decided to wait until they are older to explain about politics,' she said.
