Stuart Pearce has insisted there is no longer any disharmony between himself and the Nottingham Forest hierarchy after having a ‘tete-a-tete’ to explain his grievances.

The manager was annoyed by the club selling key players Jamaal Lascelles and Karl Darlow to Newcastle United for £7m without his knowledge but now the money has been reinvested in record signing Britt Assombalonga and Michail Antonio he describes it as ‘very good business’.

Pearce stressed that his fallout was primarily with Lalou Tifrit, head of finance, for his failure to keep information about the deals up to date, meaning it was Lascelles who actually broke the news he hold been sold.

Moving on: Stuart Pearce insists there is no bad feeling between him and Fawaz Al Hasawi

Stars: But Jamaal Lascelles and Karl Darlow were sold on the cheap to Premier League side Newcastle United

Pearce believes the relationship between himself, Tifrit, and owner Fawaz Al-Hasawi, is now comfortable.

‘At the start of the week if someone had said to me, “You’re going to sell two players to Newcastle and get them loaned back for the rest of the season - then re-invest that money into buying two players,” would I have done it? The answer would be yes if I’m honest.

‘It’s very good business. We had a bit of a tete-a-tete, myself and the owners, more the financial people more so than Fawaz. He didn’t have a conversation with me in that respect.

‘They consulted me about a possible move, but where they fell short was to tell me they’d actually gone. But we’ve addressed that. 

Hierarchy: Pearce said his  fallout was primarily with head of finance Lalou Tifrit

New boss: Stuart Pearce said he was extremely disappointed with the decision

‘I’m quite comfortable now with our relationship, they moved heaven and earth to get me these players in yesterday. It’s been an incredible week business wise, but an exciting week.

‘I’d rather it be like this rather than sedate and us doing no business at all. There’s no doubt it wasn’t right and proper what happened, whether you’d call that a breakdown in communications I don’t know.

‘But we’ve gone past that, me as an individual I’m not prepared to walk away from this club. That’s for sure. It’s like everything in football, sometimes the hierarchy at clubs fall out. But this was a reasonably public fall out. 

Making his mark: Al Hasawi purchased the Championship club back in 2012

‘Fawaz will be at the game on Saturday and I want to deliver a winning performance for him. Between the pair of us, we have the ability to push this club forwards.

‘I was excited the day I came in to work under him as manager, and I’m excited now. Success for him is success for me and vice-versa.

‘I don’t want to big headed, but I believe I am the right man for this job. I want to win promotion and aim for both cup competitions.’
