A rare wax mould of Albert Einstein is being auctioned online - and could be set to fetch over £1million.

The model of the genius physicist is thought to have been made over 60 years ago after being commissioned by Einstein himself in 1947.

And unlike other waxworks of Einstein which exist, the sculpture being sold on eBay was made after being peeled directly from Einstein's own face.

Lifelike: The sculpture is thought to be a one-of-a-kind as it was peeled from the face of the man himself

Rare: The waxwork was made 60 years ago after being personally commissioned by Einstein in 1947

Immortalised: The waxwork had spent half a century in a museum in Kentucky, but is now being sold online

The work is believed to have been done by Katherine Stubergh, a famous American wax sculpturer, in 1947 and is signed by her and the physicist on the neck of the model.

It was displayed for fifty years at Mammoth Cave Wax Museum in Kentucky before it closed in May this year. The other wax works have already been sold off.

Genius: The renowned physicist, pictured here in 1944, died in 1955 aged 76

The wax head of the nobel prize winning scientist also comes with a full body as well and real hair.

Owner Michael Todd said: 'It was originally bought by the museum owner Herbert Moore and it's been on display since.

'We have spoken to experts in Albert Einstein memorabilia who think it could reach around $1.5 million.

'It's so rare and unusual because it was peeled off his face. It can't ever be replicated, it is a complete one-of-a-kind.

'The reason Einstein commissioned it was because they were both from Germany and Stubergh was known as the best sculptor in the world.

'There were two copies of the mould made but no-one knows where the other one is.

'I would describe the wax-work as 
gorgeous, identical and in mint condition. It's so realistic that he 
looks like he could stand up and walk across the room.

'It's such a rare piece and can never be repeated.

'We think it could attract bids from museums or collectors.'
