It is a bizarre mix of kitesurfing and sailing - and could be the next big extreme sport.

Two Dutch sailors invented the sport after deciding to try and fly their boat using a kite.

Now the Kitetender has gone on sale, and the pair believe it could be the next big thing in watersports.

The new sport involves using a kite to 'tow' a boat through the water

Length: 4.00 m (13 ft)Width: 1.20 m (3.94 ft)Weight: 75 kg (165 lb)Material: FiberglassKite: North Kite Dyno from 7 sqm – 17 sqm (75 sq.ft - 183 sq.ft)Crew: 1 or 2

Peter Renssen and  designer Peter Schermer have spent four years developing the boat.

'Years of testing with normal open sailing dinghy’s and prototype resulted in the KiteTender concept,' they said.

The unique design was especially created for 'kitesailing' after Renssen saw a kitesurfer in the South of France who was having problems with his knees.

The kitesurfer jumped onboard a small fishing boat before launching his kite and sailing the boat to shore.

'That image was stored in my brains for some 15 years,' Renssen told Gizmag.

'As I used to be a sailor, I hated to be located at just one spot or spending a lot of time doing maintenance and rigging.

'So without spending hours to fit the mast you can just find a good spot to inflate your Kite, attach it to the Kitetender, launch it and away you go.'

Its inventors say the sport blends traditional sailing and kiteboarding

There are several variation of the kite depending on how fast the sailor wants to go.

'You can choose a rather relaxed start with a small kite or choose the extreme with a bigger Northkite Dyno in big winds - although for the extreme you’d better be quite experienced,' the firm says.

'Kitesailing is more like sailing, you steer your kitetender with a rudder and you do have a centreboard, and you steer your kite.

Within Europe the Kitetender 400 is currently priced at €5,299 (US$7,090) and the Kitetender 650 will cost €19,999 (US$26,750).
