FIFA’s warring ethics chiefs Michael Garcia and Hans-Joachim Eckert have agreed to meet to sort out their dispute that has sent football’s world governing body into meltdown.

Eckert, chairman of the Adjudicatory chamber, said in a brief statement on Friday night: ‘Michael Garcia and I communicated today and decided to meet in the coming days.’

This follows the outcry at Garcia, who led the investigation into World Cup corruption, damning Eckert’s findings from his report and taking his case of misrepresentation to the FIFA appeals committee.

FIFA will not comment further because Garcia’s appeals process has begun.

Meanwhile, two of FIFA’s most influential ExCo committee members have added their names to the growing list of football powerbrokers demanding Garcia’ s report be published in full.

Eckert had concluded there was no reason to re-run the 2018 and 2022 bidding and bizarrely criticised England 2018, who gained only two votes, for the way they tried to gain the support of disgraced former FIFA executive member Jack Warner.

FIFA vice-president Jeffrey Webb and United States representative Sunil Gulati said in a joint statement: 'Given the disagreement between the two chairmen of the Investigatory and Adjudicatory Chambers of the Ethics Committee and to ensure complete transparency we believe the full report conducted by the FIFA Ethics Committee into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups should be made public as soon as possible.

'This can be done with appropriate redaction to protect any confidentiality required by the FIFA Code of Ethics. Providing the entire independent report for inspection is in the best interest of the game and FIFA.'

But Eckert said on Friday: 'I don’t think it is possible because I have to respect the rights of confidentiality for Continental law.

'Maybe it’s another thing in the US, but in Continental law I can’t do it and I can’t do it in total even by the FIFA code of ethics. I will not do it.'

And Eckert defended his judgement saying 'a lot of it was word for word from Garcia.'
