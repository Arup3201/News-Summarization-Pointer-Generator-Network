Police are set to investigate a video which showed a teenage wakeboarding champion being dragged along a waterway by a £1million Ferrari at 'more than 80mph'.

Daredevil  Jorge Gill, 19, got onto a wakeboard on the Maud Foster Drain north of Boston, Lincolnshire and was dragged along by a bright yellow Ferrari F50.

But the reported speed of the car could prompt a police investigation into the stunt - which took place on a country lane which has a speed limit of 60mph.

A video has emerged of Jorge Gill wakeboarding at reported speeds of up to 80mph behind a yellow Ferrari in a flooded ditch north of Boston, Lincolnshire

Photos taken at the scene show the wakeboarding champion clinging onto the line attached to the Ferrari as it flies along the road

The video shows Mr Gill jumping into the ditch after fixing his feet to the board.

The driver of the Ferrari - a mid-90s sports car with a top speed of 200mph which is regarded as 'a road-legal racing car' - then accelerates down the country lane next to the ditch as Mr Gill holds on.

Mr Gill, a two-time European wakeboarding champion, hurtled along the river as the Ferrari hit what was claimed to be speeds of 84mph.

The film was shot by TaxTheRich, a  group of fast car enthusiasts known for making shocking videos.

In the past they have thrashed a Rolls-Royce around a country estate and took a Ferrari Enzo rallying. 

Mr Gill, from North London, became an internet sensation earlier this year when he wakeboarded through a flooded car park in Guildford.

The video posted on YouTube shows Mr Gill tie a cord to the spoiler of the Ferrari before jumping into the flooded ditch

He then holds on as the sports car drives along the neighbouring road, pulling him along at high speeds

The video shows him holding on for a distance of around 100metres as the car drives along the country road before he collapses into the river

The adrenaline junkie, who is also a five-time national champion, said he had the idea for the stunt while travelling.

Boasting about the video, he said: 'I was on a mini-bus in Portugal when the idea came to me as a supercar flew past the bus and next to it was a river.

'The idea clicked, combining a supercar with wakeboarding seemed very unique to me. 

'I was a little nervous beforehand. Normally I do around 20mph but for this I was going a lot faster. We had a few warm ups at lower speed and it was a bit scary when you hear the Ferrari's engine.

'It is dangerous, but you have to forget about the dangerous side until afterwards.'

A spokesman for Lincolnshire Police said: 'The footage showing the wakeboarder and the Ferrari has been brought to the attention of Lincolnshire Police.

'We will examine it to establish if any offences have been committed. It appears that there may be issues concerning excessive speed and the manner in which the car was driven.'

It is said the car reached speeds of more than 80mph on the 60mph-limit stretch of road, prompting a possible police investigation
