When Tracey Emin failed to win the 1999 Turner Prize, she knew who to blame: herself. Her candid, uncontrollable and sometimes foul mouth in particular.

Executives at Channel 4, who were televising the prize-giving ceremony, had phoned the night before and said: ‘If you do win, you cannot swear.’ They couldn’t trust her to behave — and, in her own heart, she couldn’t trust herself.

On the night, the 35-year-old told reporters: ‘I knew I wouldn’t win… art is not my strong point, life is… I’m a brilliant loser.’

Shocking: When My Bed by Tracey Emin was revealed, it appalled the critics. But it became symbolic

She may not have won the £20,000 prize, but her entry My Bed, made her infinitely more famous than the other shortlisted artists and confirmed her as the First Ladette of British art.

The ladette was a late-1990s phenomenon. The name was coined after a marketing study found 550,000 of 2 million young adults who were single, drinking more than eight pints a week, and had laddish attitudes — were women.

She was an alarming creature: beery, sweary, football-mad and promiscuous. Able to drink any man under the table, then eat his share of  the chips and kebab on the way home.

Emin’s bed was a devastating depiction of this very modern woman’s lifestyle.

Boozy: Tracey Emin couldn't be trusted to accept the Turner Prize without swearing

When it was first exhibited, her unmade double bed strewn with straggly tights, used condoms, worn knickers, cigarette butts, vodka bottles, scrunched tissues, greying slippers and a forlorn toy dog appalled critics.

Gallery-goers queued to see it, fascinated by its dirtiness and delinquency. So great were visitor numbers that Tate Britain had to re-design the exhibition space to give more room to the work.

One letter to a broadsheet newspaper from a retired gentleman from Cirencester fumed that Emin’s bed ‘so clearly demonstrates the decline in orderly, ethical and moral standards which seems to me to have been constant since the cessation of National Service.’

The bed became an instant symbol of slobbish modern morals.

Earlier this week it was announced that the work by Emin — now a CBE and aged 50 — will be sold at auction by Christie’s over the summer for an estimated £1.2 million.

It comes from the collection of Charles Saatchi, adman, art collector and ex-husband of Nigella Lawson, who bought it for a remarkable £150,000 in 2000.

Before the bed, Emin was best-known for two other, shocking, things.

The first was a work exhibited at the aptly-named Sensation exhibition organised by Saatchi in 1997 called Everyone I Have Ever Slept With — a tent embroidered with the names of everyone she’d shared a bed with.

The second was her appearance on a late-night arts panel show that same year, riotously drunk and unspeakably rude.

After announcing she wanted to phone her mum and swearing, she removed her microphone with fumbling fingers and wobbled off set while a fellow guest valiantly tried to keep up a conversation about J M W  Turner’s great storm paintings.

Legacy: The popularity of her bed must have frustrated Emin (pictured in 2011), who is in fact a talented artist

When My Bed was unveiled, ‘Mad Tracey from Margate’ as she called herself became the most famous artist in Britain and a lightning conductor for fury about contemporary British art.

The bed was the product of a chaotic low point in Emin’s always chaotic life. A failed romance had resulted in severe depression.

She drank too much, slept around, smoked a lot and ate almost nothing. Her weight had dropped to just six-and-a-half stone.

One morning, after the binge to end all binges, she woke up dry-mouthed, dizzy and certain that if she didn’t drink some water she would die. Crawling back from the bathroom and catching sight of the bed she thought: ‘Ugghh!’

Then, she later recalled, her view 
changed: the bed went from looking horrible to beautiful, even 
classical. ‘From a distance,’ she said, ‘it looked like a painting'

Then, she later recalled, her view changed: the bed went from looking horrible to beautiful, even classical. ‘From a distance,’ she said, ‘it looked like a painting.’

When, shortly afterwards, she was nominated for the Turner Prize and asked to submit new works to the exhibition, she had the idea of recreating the bed with all its mess in the Tate’s handsome, colonnaded gallery on London’s Millbank.

In the press coverage that followed, the three other Turner short-listers were eclipsed. The winner, unassuming video artist Steve McQueen was barely mentioned.

Emin may have stolen his thunder on the night, but earlier this year, his feature film 12 Years A Slave won the Best Picture Oscar.

The bed’s notoriety was aided by a headline-grabbing stunt by two Chinese-born satirists, Yuan-Cai and Jian Jun Xi, who gleefully jumped up and down on it before being grabbed by police.

Now that the bed is to be auctioned, there is talk about whether it should be ‘saved for the nation’.

Earlier this week, the Guardian said ‘the sale is likely to be the last opportunity for the bed to be secured for a public museum in Britain.’

Legend: Should the unmade bed be 'saved for the nation', as was argued in the Guardian's pages this week?

While art-lovers can warm to campaigns to stop works by Thomas Gainsborough or John Constable from being sold to foreign collectors, it is hard to see why more than a million should be raised to keep Emin’s grubby tights here.

The fact is that My Bed, although Emin’s most well-known work, has little to recommend it. In the mind of the public, all her other art has been smothered beneath the bed’s unwashed blankets.

This must gall Emin, who is a talented draughtsman. Her unsettling sketches of nudes and of the  Margate sea-front in Kent have a scraggly, whimsical beauty.

Sedate activity: But Tracey Emin once drank lager and spirits, not wine or cocktails.

The bed required no such skill. As many mothers pointed out in newspaper letters pages at the time, they had teenagers whose bedrooms were as messy as Emin’s.

Her artwork is valuable more for what it tells us about a particular sort of young woman and a particular culture in the late-1990s.

The ladette poster girls were the DJs Sara Cox and Zoe Ball and TV presenter Denise Van Outen. They were endlessly photographed ‘’aving it large’ at London clubs. On the morning of her wedding to DJ Fatboy Slim, Ball appeared in a midriff-bearing top and jeans, clutching a bottle of Jack Daniels, a cigarette hanging from her lips.

Denise Van Outen, then starring on Channel 4’s The Big Breakfast, flashed her bra near Prince Charles at a pop concert. I was aged eleven at the time, too young to be influenced by the ladettes but old enough read about them in the pages of Heat magazine.

A survey about twenty-something singles concluded that a ladette ‘changes her man more often than her duvet cover.’

She drank lager and spirits rather than wine or cocktails. This was the era, too, of lurid, sickly alcopops: Bacardi Breezers and WKDs.

The ladette bible was Cosmopolitan magazine, with its ‘real-life sex confessions’. Circulation rose through the 1990s, peaking at 476,288 in December 1998.

Tracey Emin lived this lifestyle: late nights, cigarettes and coffee for breakfast, casual sexual encounters, swearing in interviews.

Every part of her life was put on display. Nothing was private.

Revealing: Every part of the artist's life was on display, something she took to extremes in much of her work

In the room next to the bed at the Tate was a video in which she told of a botched abortion in searing detail. Doctors had not realised she was pregnant with twins, and sent her home still carrying a second baby. She collapsed in agony hours later and lost the other child.

She confessed to sexually transmitted infections and revealed her favourite sexual position. Once, she was questioned by police after allegedly pulling another woman’s hair in the loos at a party.

She signed an advertising contract with Becks beer and appeared naked on bottle labels.

And she poured this harum-scarum life into her art. It has often been ugly; the bed, downright depressing. There is a loneliness about it — it is, after all an empty bed — and a sense of regret about a life which is missing the reassurance of order and stability.

But what she achieved with that bed, the most famous work of art not to win the Turner Prize, was to depict a social type: the unrepentant, though perhaps not terribly happy, ladette.

In its way, it is a sad and devastating modern equivalent of William Hogarth’s Gin Lane — a grotesque satire on drunkenness, squalor and poverty in the 18th century.

The work by Tracey Emin has negligible artistic value, but as a record of bad behaviour at the turn of the millennium, there is nothing to rival her unmade bed.
