Julia Roberts’ family have accused her sister’s fiance of refusing to hand over her personal items as the legal war between them over control of Nancy Motes’ estate turns increasingly hostile.

Relatives of the August: Osage County star say that John Dilbeck has not given up Nancy Motes' furniture and a painting she made before she died - as the two sides wrestle for control.

According to legal documents the work is a painting of Galena, Illinois which is of ‘great sentimental value’ to her mother Betty Motes.

Angry mother: In harsh language Betty Motes (at right with daughter Julia Roberts) accuses John of being ¿self-serving¿ and accuses him of ¿profiteering¿ over Nancy¿s death by selling his story to tabloid newspapers

In harsh language Betty accuses John of being ‘self-serving’ and accuses him of ‘profiteering’ over Nancy’s death by selling his story to tabloid newspapers.

She also alleges that he has has been trying to ‘harass’ Roberts and her family in court papers that lay bare the extent of the rancor.

Betty and Roberts have been at war with John since Nancy took an overdose on February 9 which killed her at the age of 37.

The former production assistant on the TV show Glee drowned in a bath surrounded by a mixture of nonprescription and prescription pills, according to the Los Angeles County Coroner.

The row now boils down to Nancy’s 13-page, three part suicide note, one part to John, one to her mother and Julia and a third to ‘everyone.’

John claims that he should be the administrator as the only part where Nancy talks about allocating her belongings is addressed to him.

But Betty claims that it is invalid because Nancy did not sign any of the sheets of handwritten paper, making it invalid under Californian law.

A close examination of five months of court documents filed at the Los Angeles Supreme Court, reveals the full timeline of the angry confrontation.

On February 13 - just four days after Nancy’s death -  Judge Daniel Murphy passed an order making Betty Motes the special administrator of Nancy’s estate.

He ruled that she could take possession of all her belongings and ‘valuable personal property’ such as financial information to prevent them from ‘damage, waste or injury’.

John was forced to hand over Nancy’s 2006 Honda Accord as well as 30 boxes of her items including jewelry and other personal effects, along with credit cards that Nancy had at the time of her death.

In a filing Betty’s lawyer Robert Eroen said that John’s attempts to take control over the estate are ‘meritless and meant solely to harass (Nancy) and (her) family’.

From the suicide note: Betty¿s lawyer said that John¿s attempts to take control over the estate are ¿meritless and meant solely to harass (Nancy) and (her) family¿. On March 19 John however hit back with his own petition and claimed that the note that said Nancy¿s suicide note to him showed he should be the administrator.

Family mystery: Among the items which John is accused of withholding is the painting, which Betty has supposedly paid him for, and several other items of furniture. It is not clear why Nancy painted a painting of Galena - her family are originally from Georgia

On March 19 John however hit back with his own petition and claimed that the note that said Nancy’s suicide note to him showed he should be the administrator.

It alleged that represented a ‘single expression of (her) final wishes for the disposition of her estate and contains the final words she desired to share with various people that were part of her life’.

On April 2 Eroen filed a response demanding the John come before the court to see if he had ‘wrongfully taken, concealed or disposed of property’ that was part of Nancy’s estate.

It also called for John to be hit with a ‘citation’ for his alleged wrongdoing.

Among the items which John is accused of withholding is the painting, which Betty has supposedly paid him for, and several other items of furniture.

Deep depression: MailOnline has already revealed how Nancy claimed in her suicide note that Roberts was so vindictive that she ¿drove me into the deepest depression I¿ve ever been in¿. She described her famous sister as a ¿so-called sibling¿ who should get nothing if she died except the memory that she pushed her over the edge.

It is not clear why Nancy painted a painting of Galena - her family are originally from Georgia.

In her filing Betty says that John’s claims on the estate are based on ‘fiction entirely made out of whole cloth’.

She says it is an ‘attempt to make money off Nancy’s death that started when he took money from tabloids shortly after her death'.

'The court should not be a party to such profiteering,' she adds.

Finally, a May 30 filing on behalf of Betty attacks John’s ‘self-serving characterization’ of the notes as false.

The last motions deal with John having to appear before the court last month to explain himself, which he did, his lawyer confirmed.

MailOnline has already revealed how Nancy claimed in her suicide note that Roberts was so vindictive that she ‘drove me into the deepest depression I’ve ever been in’.

She described her famous sister as a ‘so-called sibling’ who should get nothing if she died except the memory that she pushed her over the edge.

Nancy also said that Roberts’s abuse had been so bad that ‘I burst into tears because I wake up’.

In a further twist the legal documents reveal that Michael Motes, Nancy’s estranged father, has been tracked down by heir chasing firm Trust and Estate Search.

He has agreed to give them 15 per cent of anything that he gets from Nancy’s estate in exchange for alerting him to his potential windfall, the documents state.

Class act: At a memorial for Nancy last May, Julia looked grief-stricken. But Nancy claimed in tweets before she died that Julia treated her badly. In one she said: 'Just so you all know, America¿s Sweetheart is a b*****'

Bequest: Nancy note said she wanted her jewelry and clothese to go to her closest friends - not her sister and mother

The latest hearing in the case took place on Monday at the Los Angeles Superior Court.

Eroen informed the court examination that John had been questioned by a judge about what other property he had in his possession.

He also requested that the court maintain the order that the Coroner's report into Nancy’s death would be kept confidential and could only be reviewed by court order. 

The court agreed and no new hearing dates were set.

Afterwards Eroen told MailOnline: ‘The estate still needs to be administered and presently we are in a holding pattern.’

John’s lawyer Morris Bird told MaillOnline: ‘Nancy Motes estate is being administered by Beth Motes so by law my client, Mr Dilbeck,  has to deliver any and all property of Nancy Motes  to her mother Betty.’

Neither John, Betty or Roberts were present.
