A lorry driver and passenger are lucky to be alive after their truck lost control on a bridge in China and swerved violently on two wheels before toppling over and crashing.

The footage was captured on CCTV as the vehicle travelled over a long sea bridge, which joins the island city of Zhoushan to China's mainland.

The white lorry appears to swerve suddenly to avoid hitting another truck in front. The vehicle rolls onto two wheels, but stays upright, before hitting the central barrier and swerving in the other direction.

Near miss: The two-wheel balancing act starts off with a violent swerve to avoid hitting a lorry in front

It then lurches over to the other side, balancing again on just two wheels before hitting the far barrier which saves it from toppling over the side of the bridge.

Remarkably the lorry bounces from one side to the other, rarely with all four wheels on the ground, and looks as though it may have gained control, before it swerves violently and eventually tips over.

Cars following the heart-stopping incident grind to a halt behind it.

According to media reports, the passenger in the truck suffered a minor head injury.

The incident happened on one of the enormous sea bridges that joins the island city of Zhoushan to the Chinese mainland.

The 28-mile(46.5km) Zhoushan sea-crossing bridge was opened nearly four years ago and is the longest sea-bridge of its kind in China.

The lorry then veers from left to right, bouncing off the crash barriers and balancing on little more than two wheels at a time before eventually crashing

It took 10 years to build and cost 13.1 billion yuan (Â£193 million).

The bridge has opened up trade to and from Zhoushan - the only city among China's more than 1,000 islands - and now lorries are a common sight on the lengthy bridge.

The crossing starts at Zhoushan and passes the islands of Lidiao, Fuchi, Cezi and Jintang. It connects with the national expressway network at Zhenhai District in Ningbo, an economically strong city of Zhejiang Province.
