They began clapping when the hearse bearing the body of Pc Nicola Hughes came into view, and they didn't stop for almost half an hour.

Thousands of police officers who had travelled from all over the country to pay their respects as the 23-year-old's funeral cortege was led through Manchester yesterday were joined by members of the public, who had heeded a call from Greater Manchester Police for 'decent people' to stand together with them.

The applause for Pc Hughes - described by colleagues as bubbly and always smiling - was followed by steady clapping for the hundreds of officers who followed the procession on foot.

Pc Hughes and her colleague Pc Fiona Bone, 32, died after attending 
what had appeared to be a routine burglary call to a house in Hattersley
in Tameside, Greater Manchester, just over two weeks ago on September 
18.

Police officers provided a guard of 
honour ahead of the cortege, led by the funeral carriage pulled by six 
horses from the force’s mounted unit and bearing the coffin, shrouded in
black cloth.

The crowd applauded as the procession went along Deansgate, until chimes sounded
from the cathedral marking the start of a 15-minute silence.

The family of Pc Hughes entered the cathedral including her mother, Susan, father, Bryn, and younger brother, Sam.

by the cathedral choir.

'She
was greatly respected and loved by her colleagues who would variously 
describe her as friendly, full of life, always willing to lend a hand, 
as keen as mustard, as brave as they come'

Police chaplain Keith Stewart

Pc Hughes, from Oldham, Greater 
Manchester, joined GMP in 2009. Her family said she wanted to make a 
difference and was doing a job she loved.

Fellow officers described her as a chatterbox, always smiling, with a bubbly, infectious personality.

Officers from forces nationwide 
volunteered to cover the shifts of GMP colleagues so they could attend 
the service at Manchester Cathedral, with most of them lining the 
funeral procession route.

Chief constables and senior officers 
from forces across England and Wales were said to be among the 1,000 
mourners inside the cathedral along with Pc Hughes's family, friends and
fellow officers.

A full-size photograph of Pc Hughes 
was mounted at the front of the church. Some mourners - members of the 
public and police - wiped away silent tears as the hymns were sung and 
poems read.

'Her family were so proud of Nicola. She was a fighter. She will be greatly missed by everyone who knew her. We will never forget her great sacrifice'

GMP chief constable Sir Peter Fahy

The congregation sang the hymns The 
Lord’s My Shepherd and In Heavenly Love Abiding. Colleagues of Pc Hughes
gave poetry and Bible readings.

Sergeant Stephen Lovatt read Death Is 
Nothing At All, Inspector Jane Brown read Don’t Let Your Hearts Be 
Troubled and Sergeant Gordon Swan read Feel No Guilt In Laughter.

Police
chaplain Keith Stewart said Pc Hughes was born at the Royal Oldham 
Hospital in 1988, attended Saddleworth High School and went to 
Huddersfield University before joining the force.

He
asked mourners to ‘remember a vibrant young woman’ who was a green belt
in karate but also enjoyed looking after her nails and hair and who 
still had ‘something of the little girl about her’.

Mr
Stewart said: ‘She was greatly respected and loved by her colleagues 
who would variously describe her as friendly, full of life, always 
willing to lend a hand, as keen as mustard, as brave as they come and a 
chatterbox.’

Also involved: Pc Fiona Bone, 32, who was the other female officer killed in the tragic incident

GMP
chief constable Sir Peter Fahy said she was ‘incredibly mature’ despite
her young years and died from ‘her own devotion to others’.

He said her family had spoken of the proud moment when every new officer brings home their uniform for the first time.

‘They
(officers) wonder will you be able to fill those boots,’ he said. ‘In 
Nicola's case, there was never any doubt. She decided not to be a 
bystander.

'Nicola and Fiona (Bone) knew that the police service has the same expectations of female officers as male officers.'

He
said Pc Hughes signed knowing she would put herself in danger and that 
an unarmed police force was not a ‘tactical option’ but that it was 
‘central to our commitment to minimum force’.

‘Nicola,
in her dedication and professionalism, in the way she carried out her 
duties, showed that policing is not about muscle but reason, restraint 
and intelligence,' he said.

‘Her
family were so proud of Nicola. She was a fighter. She will be greatly 
missed by everyone who knew her. We will never forget her great 
sacrifice.’

A big screen was relaying the funeral 
at the rear of the cathedral for hundreds gathered outside.

Dale
Cregan, 29, is currently on remand accused of the murder of both 
policewomen, father and son David and Mark Short - and four attempted 
murders.

The 
funeral of Pc Bone will take place at the same venue tomorrow.
