This is the horrifying moment a bus driver was stabbed in the eye with a Stanley knife by a passer-by.

The 41-year-old was driving his route along the high street in Penge, south east London, when the suspect and another man with a dog walked out in front of the bus.

The driver challenged the man, who was crossing the road with a young child, after he was forced to slam on his brakes and he proceeded to kick the doors of the bus as it passed.
