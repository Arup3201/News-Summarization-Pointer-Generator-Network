A policeman's daughter accidentally killed a celebrated opera singer and herself when she drove away sobbing from a break-up with her boyfriend, an inquest heard.

Father-of-two Robert Poulton died after Jessica Christie-Sturges, 19, drifted onto the wrong side of the road and smashed into his car head-on.

Baritone Mr Poulton, 55, who sang at the Royal Opera House and Glyndebourne, was heading to his home in Heathfield, East Sussex, when his Fiat was hit by Miss Christie-Sturges' Ford.

She died from multiple injuries at the scene and Mr Poulton died after suffering a heart attack on his way to hospital, an inquest heard.

The first paramedic at the scene was delayed because his sat-nav sent him the wrong way, the hearing was told, and another doctor called was then diverted to another incident.

When emergency workers did arrive at the accident on the B2102 at Cross-in-Hand, near Heathfield, Mr Poulton, who did not realise the severity of his internal injuries, told them to tend to Miss Christie-Sturges first.

He died later after suffering a heart attack caused by internal injuries suffered as a result of his ribs being broken by his seatbelt.

Ten minutes before the accident, Miss Christie-Sturges had been told by her boyfriend Alex Bland that he was ending their nine-month romance because he felt it hard to trust her.

Mr Bland said Jessica left his home in Cross-in-Hand around 8.30pm on the night of the crash last October.

He said: 'We discussed how it [our 
relationship] did not work. 'She was lovely to be around and very 
genuine but at times I felt hard to trust.'

He said around 7pm she left his home 
for around ten minutes before returning. At this stage, he said, she was
'sobbing' and very upset but calmed down.

He offered to drive her when she left his home for the second - and final - time but she said no.

Ten minutes later, he sent her a final text saying 'I'm sorry Jess. Take care of yourself', but by that time she was already dead.

The inquest in Eastbourne heard that sales assistant Miss Christie-Sturges, whose father is a Metropolitan Police officer, was three-quarters on the wrong side of the road when she hit Mr. Poulton's car.

Mr Poulton, who had two sons, Thomas, 22, and William, 13, was driving home after leaving his family at their holiday home in Wales to prepare for a performance the next day.

The first people at the scene found 
Mr Poulton talking, the inquest was told. He described hearing a 'bang' and then waking up, and anxiously asked after Jessica repeatedly.

Accident investigator PC Paul Banks said both cars were travelling at about 60mph.

He said it was likely Jessica 
'drifted across' the carriageway and added: 'Miss Christie-Sturges was 
almost entirely on the wrong side of the road.'

The inquest also heard how the initial paramedic at the scene had gone to the wrong location because of a sat nav blunder.

Chris Wilkinson, the assistant coroner for East Sussex, said he believed Jessica had been 'distressed by her break up' and suffered a 'momentary lapse in concentration' and recorded a verdict of accidental death.

Philippa Poulton, Mr Poulton's widow, said: 'Rob was wonderful. He was a loving father and a great man.

'Asking how the other driver was when he was injured - that was him in a nutshell. He was a wonderful singer, but he was so much more than that.

'I still listen to his music. We had 30 years together. A love like that doesn't die; it is an enduring love.'

Miss Christie-Sturges' family previously described her as 'a fun-loving 19-year-old who touched the hearts of so many'.
