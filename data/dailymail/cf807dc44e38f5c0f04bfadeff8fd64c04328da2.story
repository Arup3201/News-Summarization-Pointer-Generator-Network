Real Madrid and Barcelona will not have to share revenue from La Liga television rights after the Spanish government backed out of a plan to bring in a law that would force them to do so.

Spain’s big two between them take £204million of the total £550m pot every season and the other clubs, who wanted legislation to force them to reduce their share, are now considering going on strike if the government don't lift their block on the new law being passed.

The rest of Europe was also keen to see the new law because Madrid and Barça earn far more than some of their main Champions League rivals from television deals.

Real Madrid and Barcelona will continue to pocket the vast majority of La Liga's TV sponsorship 

The likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi continue to attract large TV audiences due to their stature 

The combined TV earnings from Europe's top leagues last season - led by the Premier League

In Germany, Bayern Munich earned around £27m in the 2013-14 season from the Bundesliga contract, Juventus earned £67m and PSG 32. 

In England, on the other hand, Liverpool were the top earners with £99m closely followed by Manchester City on £98m – both behind Real Madrid and Barcelona.

Spain sports minister Miguel Cardenal had been keen to wave through a change but he has been overruled leaving the other clubs furious and, according to Diario AS, set to meet next week to discuss the possibility of stopping the league with strike action. 

In the 2013-14 season Cardiff earned less than any other Premier League club, £64m and yet still made more than twice as much as La Liga winners Atletico Madrid in Spain who earned £31m from television revenue.

Valencia earn the third highest amount in Spanish football but the £35m they pick up per season is still dwarfed by that £102 premium given to both Real Madrid and Barcelona.

Liverpool earned the most amount of TV money in the Premier League last season 

Bayern Munich earned just over £27m in TV sponsorship last season while Juventus came out in top in Italy

At Real Sociedad, David Moyes’ club must cope on just £18m a season while as many as five clubs in the 2013-14 season in Spain only made £13m.

Real Madrid and Barcelona had both indicated they would be prepared to give up their advantage but the other clubs wanted it written in the statutes to avoid close season bickering every time a deal was up for renewal.

The other clubs had assured Madrid and Barcelona they would still get €140m because by joint-bargaining the total money made from the first combined deal would move up from £550 closer to £730m by that dream now looks in tatters.

Clubs will go on negotiating deals separately with Real Madrid and Barcelona both having already agreed deals for next season again over the of £100m mark.
