Heartwarming pictures of students in Vanuatu laying books out in the sun to dry so they can return to school have emerged.

The pictures show hundreds of books from the Central School library, which was blown away in the storm, littered across the schoolyard.

Reportedly, students, teachers and school headmaster Paul Alexander Hatyay  went to the effort of putting the books out so that they can be put to good use in the classroom again as soon as possible.

International aid agencies ramped up appeals for cyclone-hit Vanuatu on Wednesday, warning that the powerful storm that affected more than two-thirds of the South Pacific island nation

However, the desperate search is still on for people lost in the storm, included an Australian teenager who sent few parents a text message as the storm was about to hit. 

It was a typically loving message from a daughter to her mother: 'I love you more than most things'. 

It was also the last time Australian parents Alison Abernethy and Rob Marshall have heard from their daughter Zoe, 18, since Cyclone Pam devastated Vanuatu five days ago.

The Canberra couple are worried sick about Zoe - a 'really good kid' who often makes her parents laugh - who is volunteering in a  school near Namaram on the island of Pentecost.

'She would have tried to contact us,' Ms Abernethy told Daily Mail Australia. 'She would have known that we're really worried about her.'

'I love you more than most things': This is last text message Alison Abernethy has received from her daughter, Zoe Marshall, since Cyclone Pam struck

But communications are down on the island and it does not help that she is staying in an 'incredibly remote' location, her mother said.  

'If you find her just hand her a SatPhone or take a photo so that we know she's alive,' Mr Marshall wrote in a blog post titled 'Where's my girl?' on Wednesday. 

In her last messages, the aspiring engineering student had told her parents that the village was well-prepared and that it 'should be fine'.

'Sorry for the early text but don't know when phone will work. We've got cat 5 warning. Should hit us tonight. Should be all good,' she said.  

She said a rat had chewed part of her sandal and, to her parents' amusement, she pledged to fill the rat's nest with rocks after the storm passed.  

Zoe - who was working with 18 other volunteers for the charity Lattitude - is not missing, her family said, but she and her fellow volunteers not been accounted for in the wake of enormous storm. 

She has donated her time to young people on the island, living in a village with'limited electricity, no running water and pit toilets.

After media reports on Wednesday, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade today told the family they have assigned a case worker for Zoe. 

'She's got a strong social conscience,' Ms Abernethy said. 'She's interested in the world and helping people. 

'It will be wonderful when we hear her voice.'
