Even though Will Ferrell took the field during an MLB spring training stunt which benefited cancer research, legendary Oakland Raiders coach John Madden apparently didn't think the actor was staying very classy.

As part of a new HBO special from Funny Or Die which is dedicated to the fight against cancer, Ferrell, 47, suited up for ten teams - including the Oakland Athletics - and played all nine positions on the baseball diamond during games in the Cactus League in Arizona on Thursday.

When Madden, 78, was asked about the stunt, he said it showed a 'lack of respect'.

The veteran actor played every position on the diamond and also took some swings as a designated hitter 

Madden, 78, is probably best known for the football video game franchise from EA Sports that bears his name

The NFL legend called in to KCBS before Ferrell took the field with the A's to discuss the stunt. 

Madden said: 'I hate it.

'That's a lack of respect for the game and for what players have to do to get where they are.'

In addition to the A's, Ferrell 'played' for the Mariners, Angels, Cubs, D'Backs, Reds, White Sox, Giants, Dodgers and Padres. 

The Super Bowl-winning coach, who is probably best known for the football video game franchise which bears his name, further explained that when he was coaching in Oakland, Golden State Warriors small forward Rick Barry said he wanted to practice with the Raiders during training camp.

Madden claimed he told his guys to flatten the NBA star. 

He said: 'I'm in training camp in Santa Rosa. Rick Barry comes walking by and he was playing for the Warriors at that time. 

'He was a friend of Al Davis' and he said he was going to go in and suit up and go out on the field and practice, to fool Al. 

'I swear this is true. 

'Jack Tatum and George Atkinson walked by and I said, "Look, if this guy comes out on the field, he's live bait and I want you to go after him the way you would go after any other player that plays on another team.'"

After the stunt, Ferrell's spring training statistics from the day were posted on baseball-reference.com
