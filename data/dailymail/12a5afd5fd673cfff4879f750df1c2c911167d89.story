Pleasure: Lobacheva changed her appearance, shaved her head and started wearing military clothes, according to reports

A  woman accused of murdering a dozen homeless people has told police she felt 'sexual pleasure' from repeatedly stabbing dying victims.

The shocking revelations came as Russian police questioned Elena Lobacheva, 25, about the slayings of 12 people in Moscow. 

She also admitted that she was inspired by a Hollywood horror movie Bride of Chucky, about a doll possessed by a serial killer.

Lobachev, 25, and Paul Voitov, 20, are accused of murdering a dozen homeless people in a crusade to clean-up the city.

Though they claimed to be targeting vagrants and alcoholics, and were nicknamed the 'Cleaners' gang', one victim, a bank worker, neither homeless nor a drunk, was stabbed 107 times.

She told police that 'randomly stabbing the body of a dying human brought her pleasure compared to sexual pleasure', reported Life News agency.

It was also alleged that on her home computer she had a 'step-by-step instruction to killing people and photos of all of her victims with their stomachs cut open and body parts cut off'.

The report continued: 'The flat of the murderer was messy and filthy. There were horrible smells and personal belongings all over the flat' which she shared with a pet rabbit.

She is nicknamed 'Chucky's Bride' by the Russian media, after admitting being obsessed since childhood with the 1998 movie, starring Jennifer Tilly, Brad Dourif, and Katherine Heigl.

'This movie, released over 15 years ago, became a sort of instruction for Elena. Lobacheva even has a tattoo on her shoulder - her favourite doll was always with her,' ran the Life News report.

The alleged serial killer's mother Olga Lobacheva claimed her daughter could not have committed murder.

'She can't, she's messy but she is a good person. She's supportive. She didn't kill. There is no anger in her eyes,' she said.

The suspected mass murderer shared a flat with her mother and stepfather, according to some reports.

Neighbours said she was 'polite and nice'.

She had experimented with her appearance. Earlier she had shaved her head, and then started wearing military clothes.

The pair are said to have started the killing spree in July last year, carrying out viscous knife attacks on each of the victims. 

It is thought they mistook bank worker Sergei Yevseyev - who was stabbed more than 100 times - as living on the streets after he stopped at a local park on his way home. 

Father Alexander Yevseyev, 60, said: 'My son Sergei was neither homeless nor alcoholic. He worked in a bank and had met with a friend in a local park for a chat and a drink.

'After leaving he was walking home when they attacked him, stabbing him over 107 times.'

The pair were caught after they were filmed attacking a street cleaner who managed to escape.

Prokhor Gorshkov, 45 had finished work and was on his way home when he was set upon by the crazed couple.

He was stabbed in the back before managing to flee to a nearby police station where he gave a description of the pair.
