An increasing number of couples set to marry this year are asking friends and family to give them cash instead of wedding presents.

Traditional gifts of toasters, microwaves and other household appliances are now seen as outdated, because the bride and groom have most likely already lived together for a number of years.

Financial contributions are seen as more useful - and those who feel awkward asking for them are turning to the power of verse to do it for them.

Cold hard cash: An increasing number of couples set to marry this year are asking friends and family to give them cash instead of wedding presents

Many couples are choosing to write a poem inside their wedding invitations to avoid the embarrassment of asking outright for money.

One example reads: 'If you were thinking of giving a gift to help us on our way/A gift of money in a card would really make our day!'

The findings come from wedding website confetti.co.uk, who surveyed 2,500 British couples and found that nearly four-fifths of those marrying this year will be asking for money instead of a gift.

Kate Thompson, the website's features writer, told the Observer: ‘As lots of couples are paying for the wedding themselves, an extra cash injection is much more welcome.

‘Some couples still feel uneasy asking for money, however, so a growing number choose to say it with a poem.’

Sarah Crown, editor of the Mumsnet website, told the publication that the trend for asking for money instead of gifts has been growing steadily for years and that readers on the forum have divided opinions.

‘Our users are fairly split,’ she says. ‘Many think it's rude, while plenty of others think it makes life much easier.’

One Mumsnet member reacted particularly critically to the trend and posted her own response to the ‘vomit-inducing’ poem.

‘I wonder if anyone's ever replied in kind?’ She asks, continuing: ‘So happy for you on your special day/We hope great joy will come your way/And, while we know that others may/Choose to mark your wedding day/By giving you money for your pot/We thought that we had better not/We hunted low and hunted high/For a special gift to remember us by/And so we hope you will adore/This special, useful ironing board.’
