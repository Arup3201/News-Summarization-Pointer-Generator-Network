When it comes to working as a team, the staff at Kamakura Japanese Restaurant have it down pat.

Lead by their knife-weilding sushi chef, the group of employees managed to take down a man with a gun who tried to rob the eatery in Champaign, Illinois, on Tuesday night.  

Tetsuji Miwa, 39, said he didn't think twice before springing to action as the 23-year-old assailant threatened the hostess with what appeared to be a revolver.

'I instantly grabbed my sushi knife, walked up to him, wrapped my arm around his shoulder and asked him what he wanted,' Miwa told The News-Gazette.

'He saw the blade, got scared and started running.'

But it wasn't over. 

Waitress Aichan Mitsuhashi-Acs saw what was happened and alerted other employees.

General manager Yuji Niizuma and assistant manager Joe Pendzialek came running from the kitchen while Mitsuhashi-Acs called 911.

'Tet was halfway out the door. We could see him with the knife,' Niizuma told the newspaper. 

'We didn't have a choice because he was engaged in the fight.' 

The three tackled the man in the car park. 

Pendzialek had grabbed a bar stool on his way out 'and cracked him over the head with it'. 

While the bandit fought back, the trio were able to restrain him until police arrived.

Afterwards, Miwa said he was worried about his special knife.  

He told the newspaper: 'It's pretty expensive so I didn't want to damage it or use it. I was telling him, 'Don't make me use this.

'As soon as the other two managers came out, I set it down to the ground very carefully because I didn't want to damage my blade.'

The suspect was arrested and has been identified as 23-year-old Clayton Dial of Ogden.

He was charged with attempted aggravated robbery, intimidation and aggravated battery.

Dial's girflriend, Kelsey Cabellero, 23, was waiting in the carpark in a white van.

She fled the scene, but police found her down the road and arrested her.

Dial's weapon turned out to be a pellet gun.

However the Kamakura staff didn't know that.

'I was very confident,' waitress Mitsuhashi-Acs said.

'We had the situation under control. 

'And the police had a great response time. They were fabulous.'

Afterwards, with a kitchen backed with orders, the team went straight back to work.
