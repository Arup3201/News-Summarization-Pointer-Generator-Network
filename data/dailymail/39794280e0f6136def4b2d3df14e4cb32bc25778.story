Mark Robson, 44, had half his foot amputated after he cut it while swimming on a holiday to Egypt

A father lost half his foot  and all his toes after cutting himself in a swimming pool while on holiday.

Mark Robson suffered a serious bone infection in the years after the injury, forcing doctors  to operate.

He  had to give up his job after the accident as  can no longer drive and struggles with basic household tasks.

The 44-year-old had been swimming in a pool in the popular Egyptian resort of Sharm El-Sheikh when he gashed his toe.

Despite the injury healing quickly, when Mr Robson returned to the UK medics said he had a bone infection and prescribed antibiotics.

But in the five years after the accident, the infection returned repeatedly and doctors were forced to carry out a series of operations.

They eventually had to amputate half his foot and his toes, leaving him needing to be cared for by his family.

As a result, he launched legal proceedings against Thomson's Tropicana Jasmine Hotel, where he was injured.

He has now won a £25,000 payout to help with everyday life, and is now calling on Thomson to improve safety measures at its resorts.

The father-of-one, of Shiremoor, North Tyneside, said: 'The impact this whole issue has had on me has been devastating.

'As well as having no choice but to leave work, I now need assistance with basic household tasks and I can't drive – so am almost entirely reliant on my wife, family and friends.

'I have completely lost my independence as I cannot bear weight on my leg.

'The holiday to the Tropicana Jasmine Hotel has become memorable for all of the wrong reasons.

'I just hope that no-one else faces what I have been through, which is why tour operators and resorts have to make sure that the safety of holidaymakers is a top priority.'

Mr Robson and his wife Gillian's holiday in August 2010 was the first time the couple had been on away since their honeymoon 16 years earlier.

Just one day into the holiday Mr Robson felt a pain in his right foot and noticed it was bleeding as he stepped out of the pool.

He said: 'I realised I must have caught it on the lining of the pool, which was quite sharp and had what seemed to be a rough concrete surface. 

'I got it bandaged up but thought it would heal fairly quickly like a standard wound.

'It stopped me from swimming for the rest of the holiday and also stopped us going on an excursion or two, but ultimately I didn't think there would be any lasting damage.'

When he returned to the UK, medics at a walk-in centre told him his toe may be infected so he went to Sunderland Royal Hospital and was prescribed antibiotics.

Mr Robson underwent an operation in 2012 to remove all of his toes and part of his bone from his right foot. He says this has left him unable to drive and struggling to carry out basic household tasks 

But by the September, his GP referred him to the podiatry clinic at the local hospital and he was admitted for treatment.

In February 2012 the bone infection returned and Mr Robson underwent an operation to remove his second toe and a large part of bone from his right foot.

Initially, he returned to work as a vehicle quality assessment operator at Nissan.

But in January 2013, he was forced to leave the job because of back pain caused by the injury, as well as the ongoing bone infection.

In February this year he had another operation in which doctors removed his remaining toes.

Mr Robson launched legal proceedings against tour operator TUI UK Limited, which trades as Thomson, which runs the hotel where he injured his foot.

He has now been awarded £25,000 to help with his living and care costs.

TUI UK has admitted liability for the accident but requires Mr Robson to prove that the problems he has since suffered are as a result of the accident.

His lawyers are now compiling medical evidence they can use as proof, and the case is ongoing.

Tonia Kingsley, the solicitor at Irwin Mitchell who is representing Mr Robson, said: 'It is hard to put into words how difficult the past four years have been for Mark, with him needing on-going medical treatment and ultimately seeing his life completely transformed as a result of what he has been through.

'What began as an injury on holiday has gone on to have serious, life-changing consequences for him and his family.

'A terrible case like this highlights the lasting effects that such accidents can have, highlighting the seriousness of such problems and why tour operators must continue to work to keep holidaymakers safe from potential risks.'

A Thomson spokeswoman said: 'Thomson is sorry to hear about the injury sustained by Mr Robson whilst he was staying at the Tropicana Jasmine Club in Egypt in 2010.

'Our legal team is in direct contact with Mr Robson's solicitors. As this is subject to legal proceedings it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.

'We would like to reassure customers that health and safety is of paramount importance to Thomson and we operate the strictest quality standards across all of our hotels.'
