For more than 50-years rumors have persisted of a top-secret base operated by the CIA - from where the spy agency planned the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion and still keeps stockpiles of chemical weapons.

Its existence has never been officially confirmed, but a new investigation claims the location for the covert base is in fact just 20 miles north of San Antonio, Texas, at the US Army facility Camp Stanley.

Referred to mysteriously over the years by the anodyne Midwest Depot, the bland code word belies the supposed role it has played over the years as the CIA fought clandestine wars in Angola, to Iran-contra to the arming of Afghan rebels.

Totally nondescript: This is the bland entrance to Camp Stanley outside San Antonio - which reportedly is the site for the CIA's most secret base - Midwest Depot

Documents that reveal brief mentions have been poured over by the New York Times, while former CIA analyst Allen Thomson has indicated that Camp Stanley is indeed the storied third CIA facility in the US, in addition to the agency's headquarters in Langley, Virginia, and Camp Peary, a military base near Williamsburg, Virginia, known by its code name, 'The Farm.'

Thomson asserts that the Camp Stanley Storage Activity (CSSA) was established in 1949 and 'has always been the cover for Midwest Depot, then the covert facility dates to the earliest days of the CIA and, speculatively, may have been created to provide an arms channel to resistance groups in Soviet-occupied Eastern Europe and elsewhere.'

Indeed, Camp Stanley has most likely played a hitherto unheralded role in some of the most contentious historical events since the 1960s.

It is allegedly where Cuban exiles prepared for the disastrous and farcical Bay of Pigs invasion attempt to topple Fidel Castro.

The facility has also been tied to arming rebels in Nicaragua and providing AK-47 rifles to Afghanistan's Northern Alliance after 9/11, so that they could battle the Taliban.

'To be a little dramatic about it, how many of those AK-47s and RPG-7s we see Islamists waving around today passed through the Midwest Depot on their way to freedom fighters in past decades?' Thomson told The New York Times.

A huge grey area of 4,000 acres on the map, Camp Stanley is south of Fair Oaks ranch near Interstae 10, 20 miles of downtown San Antonio.

It maintains a low-key gatehouse and some visible warehouses around the perimeter.

Satellite images reveals dozens of nondescript bunkers lining the interior of the base.

According to The New York Times, Camp Stanley is so secret that a congressional investigator during the Iran-contra affair in the 1980s made the observation that the facility where the CIA kept missiles bound for Iran classified, even as other 'incredible things were unveiled during the hearings.'

Three years ago it was acknowledged that the base was a munitions storage facility, but no more.

'The mission of Camp Stanley is the receipt, storage and issuance of ordnance material as well as quality assurance testing and maintenance of military weapons and ammunition,' Phil Reidinger, a spokesman for the Army Medical Department Center and School, said Monday.

'Because of its ordnance missions, Camp Stanley is a controlled-access facility.'

However, research published in December by retired CIA analyst Thomson, who worked for the CIA from 1972-1985, includes a '1967 CIA memo linking Camp Stanley to paramilitary training of Cuban exiles before the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion and a 1987 memo showing that equipment bound for the Nicaraguan Contras passed through' the facility, according to the Times.

In their research The New York Times also discovered a 1963 CIA memo that discusses 300 tons of C-4 plastic explosives available in the 'Midwest Depot stocks' with no restrictions 'because the items have world-wide distribution and are consequently deniable.'

A 2009 interview with an anonymous CIA logistics officer claimed that AK-47 rifles sent to the Northern Alliance after 9/11 came from the Midwest Depot.

Also, arms sent to anti-Marxist fighters in the Angolan civil war in the 1970s claimed the same.

Thomson, who claims to have never known the location of Midwest Depot during his time at the CIA told The New York Times he had found an explicit reference in a 1986 memo by the notorious Colonel Oliver North - the key figure in the Iran-contra affair.

The memo stated that the CIA would transport missiles bound for Iran to 'Midwest Depot, Texas' in anticipation of flying them out of Kelly Air Force base.

Mentioned in memos: Lieutenant-Colonel Oliver North, former aide to former National Security Adviser John Poindexter, is sworn in on 9 December 1986 before the House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing in Washington, D.C. on arms sales to Iran

In July, according to Thomson, the army bought two million rounds of ammunition of the same caliber to fit Ak-47s, which American soldiers do not use. The delivery address was Camp Stanley.

However, the key revelation in identifying Camp Stanley as Midwest Depot was the 2011 lawsuit filed by former CIA employee Kevin Shipp.

He claimed his family, who lived at a government owned house at Camp Stanley, fell ill because of toxins at the base.

The lawsuit and subsequent memoir written by Shipp was prevented, but his son Joel, who is not bound by confidentiality has written a memoir of his own.

In it he refers to Camp Stanley as 'a secret base which had been used for illegal arms running and chemical weapons storage.'
