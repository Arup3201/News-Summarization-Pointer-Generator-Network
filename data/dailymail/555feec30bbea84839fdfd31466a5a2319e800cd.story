For a man whose team began this tournament by putting five past the World Champions, Louis van Gaal is becoming adept at lowering expectations.

'We are not a fantastic team,' said the Holland manager on Friday night. 'We just a team that’s difficult to beat.'

This is very much Van Gaal’s way these days. So tired of criticism of his team in the run-up to this World Cup, the veteran coach has decided to play along.

Deep down, though, Van Gaal thinks Holland can win this tournament and he finally offered a fleeting glimpse of his feelings when asked about a bracelet he has been seen wearing on the touchline at his team’s previous games.

'The children from the head of our sponsors made it,' said Van Gaal.

'I was given it because her children made it and I promised to wear it. I will wear it again. I will always wear it when I'm coach of Holland. That's another three matches, as you know.'

If the incoming manager of Manchester United is to leave his current post in the most memorable way possible then there is likely to be some excitement along the way. This Dutch team is not one that does things quietly.

Van Gaal spoke yesterday of the sense of togetherness and unity that he believes characterises this squad but Holland have still had to come from behind three times already to reach the last eight.

'One of the things we can is turn a match round,' said Van Gaal.

'Sometimes it’s down to luck but also due to considering your chances and opportunities.

'We haven't played as well in ball possession as we can at times but when the opposition have the ball we're one of the best teams, if not the best.

'That's why we've progressed so far.'

Van Gaal’s insistence of playing on the counter has caused much debate at home. Certainly it almost failed them against Mexico in Fortaleza last week when only two goals at the death saved them.

However, it says much for his players’ faith in Van Gaal’s philosophy that they adhere slavishly to his instructions, even if we may see them adopt a slightly more proactive approach at Arena Fonte Nova today.

'Of course in Holland we're used to playing 4-3-3, attacking football with two wingers,' said winger Arjen Robben.

'But I think you also have to look at the quality of the squad. That's what we did, and what the manager did.

Talking tactics: Van Gaal acknowledges that his team have not always been fluent, but they are getting results

'We spoke about it a lot with him and decided to play a slightly different system.

'I think it's very functional, maybe not as dominant as we are used to playing, but still very good. And we've played four games and scored 12 goals, so that's pretty positive.

'I think we are on a mission together. We are here to win matches and to go as far as possible.

'I don't think the expectations were that high before the tournament and, as a result, we can be very proud of where we are.'
