A man was left in agony after fracturing his penis during sex.

The 42-year-old had to undergo emergency surgery after snapping a fibrous membrane inside the organ.

His erect phallus had inadvertently collided with his partner’s perineum, the area in front of the anus.

The man heard a snap, felt his penis become immediately flaccid, and noticed a rush of blood from the tip.

He was rushed to the A&E department of a Boston hospital as he was suffering severe pain, according to a case report in the New England Journal of Medicine.

A 42-year-old man rushed to hospital after fracturing his penis during sex. After accidentally hitting his erect penis on his partner's perineum, he heard a loud snap, saw a spurt of blood and felt searing pain (file picture) 

Doctors found he had torn his tunica albuginea, the watertight and fibrous outer sheath of one of the penis' inner chambers, the corpus cavernosa.

The corpus cavernosa runs along the length of the penis and is filled with spongy tissue, into which blood flows to create an erection.

The tunica albuginea helps to trap the blood in the corpus cavernosa, maintaining an erection.

It is a whitish and fibrous membrane. 

The snap had led to a tear in the corpus cavernosa’s sheath, which meant blood leaked out, creating swelling.

It was forced out of his body through the urethra, the tube by which a man passes urine, which is why he saw blood coming out of the end of his penis.

When he arrived at hospital, he was taken straight to the operating room for emergency repair.

Doctors said the consequences of such a fracture include erectile dysfunction, as scar tissue known as fibrous plaques can form in the penis, meaning

They warned it is also possible to suffer a curve or bend in the penis, and damage to the nerves in the genitals.

Fortunately, the man, who was seen three and six months after surgery, regained his ability to obtain an erection - without any noticeable curvature or plaque forming in his penis.

The news comes after MailOnline reported on the story of Edward Stalling, who endured a painful erection for several weeks.

He has suffered a rare side effect to a sleeping tablet given to him in hospital.

Mr Stalling was hospitalised for 10 days as doctors treated his prolonged erection.

He developed fibrosis – where the arteries and muscles in the penis becoming hardened with fibrous tissue – as a result of the continued erection.

He claims this has left him impotent and with difficulty urinating - and is suing the hospital for not making the side effects of the sleeping tablets clear to him.
