Five swimmers had to be rescued from an aggressive dolphin in Ireland last night.

The dolphin ‘attacked’ the group of swimmers, by ‘circling and swimming at them in an intimidating way’.

According to bystanders, the mammal glanced off the swimmers with his tail and nose during the attack off Blackrock Tower at Salthill, Galway.

A member of the public raised the alarm and contacted the coastguard who requested the assistance of the Galway Lifeboat.

When it arrived at the scene around 7:30pm, a local fishing vessel had separated the dolphin from the swimmers.

The lifeboat joined the fishing vessel in keeping the dolphin away from the swimmers until they made it safely ashore.

According to Galway RNLI, the swimmers were very shook by the incident but did not require medical assistance.

Lifeboat Helmsman Ciaran Oliver said the crew stayed in the area a while longer to ensure all swimmers got ashore and then did a sweep of the beach from Blackrock to Seapoint to warn others, assisted by additional lifeboat crew on the promenade.

This is the second ‘dolphin attack’ to take place in Ireland in the past few months.

In July, a bottlenose dolphin was reported to have deliberately pushed a man underwater while he was swimming in the sea off Sherkin Island, County Cork.

The animal is said to have ‘lashed out’ at the swimmer twice with its tail, and acted ‘aggressively’.
