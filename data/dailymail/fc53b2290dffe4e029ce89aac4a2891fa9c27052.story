Kim Jong-un's ex-girlfriend appears to have risen from the dead with reports she was seen on North Korean state television for the first time since she was reportedly executed in 2013.

The North Korean former love interest was said to have been executed in September last year, alongside dozens of singers and dancers, for making a pornographic film.

But the story, published by the country's own newspapers, is being questioned after Hyon Song-wol made an appearance on television.

The Korean singer was seen delivering a speech at a national art workers rally in Pyongyang.

Kim Jong-Un¿s ex-girlfriend, Hyon Song-Wol, was recently seen delivering a speech at a national art workers rally on national television, despite rumours she had been executed

During her speech, the Moranbong band member even thanked Kim for his leadership while pledging to work harder to 'stoke up the flame for art and creative work', according to the Herald Sun.

Her appearance comes as a shock to many after it had been reported that she was brutally executed by machine gun on August 20 following her August 17 arrest.

The pop star and other members of North Korea’s 
most famous music groups were said to have been marched in front of a firing squad and 
gunned down without facing trial, while their families and other members of the groups were 
ordered to watch.

The victims’ families and friends were then taken away to a labour camp, having been found ‘guilty  by association’.

The singer was reported by South Korean newspapers to have been  brutally executed by machine gun on August 20 from order's directly from the South Korean leader (pictured above with his wife)

Hyon was rumoured to have been accused of featuring in a pornographic film alongside dozens of singers and dancers

Those 'executed' had been accused of making videos of themselves performing sex acts and then selling the recordings, with some
 of the musicians also reported to be in possession of Bibles, which are 
banned in North Korea, when they were detained.

North Korean officials denied the reports at the time, labeling the rumours the work of the South Korean government and media.

But South Korea’s own spy chief Nam Jae-joon ignited reports again when he was quoted as saying 'We are aware of the execution of some 10 people associated with the Unhasu Orchestra,' in October.

Hyon and Kim knew each other as teenagers then had an affair when he was leader

Speculation escalated, suggesting that Kim’s wife, Ri Sol-ju, was to blame for the 'execution'.

Kim,
 30, who succeeded his late father as supreme leader of North Korea in 
2011, met the pop singer ten years ago when he returned from studying in 
Switzerland. However, his father, Kim Jong-il, disapproved of the 
relationship and ordered it to end.

Hyon went on to marry an officer in the North Korean military and is believed to have had a baby.

But
 rumours had circulated that Kim was still secretly seeing her, followed by reports he had demanded her execution.
