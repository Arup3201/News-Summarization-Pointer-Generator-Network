A Fijian soldier who spent 13 years in the Army has sent his four medals to the Prince of Wales after a fight against deportation from the UK left him facing bankruptcy.

Bale Baleiwai, 32, sent the medals to Prince Charles with a letter saying that they had lost their meaning because of the treatment received by him and his British wife and children.

The father-of-two could lose his Bournemouth, Dorset, house and faces possible bankruptcy after a costly fight to stay in the UK which he won last month.

Honour: Campaign medals, similar to those given to Mr Baleiwai, which were presented to Prince Harry and fellow members of the Household Cavalry Regiment for service in Afghanistan (file picture)

In the letter he wrote: 'My service to Queen and country have been dishonoured and I have been betrayed.'

Mr Baleiwai has earned campaign medals for tours of duty in Northern Ireland, Bosnia, Afghanistan and two tours in Iraq.

According to The Times, he added: 'Throughout this period we have tried to be proactive, graceful and dignified.

'We have not even received an apology from this Government and they continue to pass the buck ... I therefore feel I can no longer accept my medals.'

Mr Baleiwai's six month fight for British citizenship began in June last year when he quit the Army.

A fight with a fellow soldier had led to an internal punishment and a criminal record which meant that his application for UK citizenship was refused.

The soldier of 12 years was shocked that his application was rejected and he and his wife Kim, 31, thought a mistake had been made.

Facing ruin: Notice has been served on the Baleiwai family home after his costly six month fight to stay in the UK

The pair never knew that the fight, which was dealt with by a commanding officer in the Army and not a law court, had led to a criminal conviction.

He had only not challenged the ruling at the time because he wanted to get on with his career, despite insisting that he was acting in self defence.

Mr Baleiwai, who served in Afghanistan, Iraq, Bosnia, Northern Ireland and alongside Prince Harry at Combermere Barracks in Windsor, decided to appeal the conviction last summer and it was quashed in November and citizenship was granted a month later.

But the family had lived off savings during Mr Baleiwai's fight to stay in the UK and have been left desolate by the battle.

Although he has since managed to find a job, notice has been served on the family home.

Under law, all Commonwealth soldiers who have served in the military for at least five years can apply to the UK Border Agency for British citizenship.
