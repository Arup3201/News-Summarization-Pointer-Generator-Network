Facebook and Twitter users should make up fake names and not use their real identity, according to a senior government advisor.

Andy Smith, head of internet security at the Cabinet Office, claimed using pseudonyms online ‘a very sensible thing to do’.

But his suggestion sparked claims that his advice would encourage criminal activity and was at odds with advice from ministers.

Cabinet Office head of internet security Andy Smith warned against using real names and birth dates online

It comes at a time when the government is considering allowing people to use their existing log-ins for social networking sites to access a new government website to apply for benefits, passports and driving licences.

Mr Smith told a Whitehall conference: ‘When you put information on the internet do not use your real name, your real date of birth.

‘When you are putting information on social networking sites don't put real combinations of information, because it can be used against you.’

Fraudsters could compile personal information ‘from Google, social networking sites, from email footers, all sorts of places’, he warned.

Criminals were capable of ‘bringing this information together and cross-correlating information and then they are using it against you’.

Mr Smith said people should give correct information when they were filling in government forms on the internet, like tax returns.

'Outrageous': Shadow culture minister Helen Goodman, left, and her opposite Ed Vaizey, right, were critical of the idea

But culture minister Ed Vaizey said he ‘wouldn't encourage people to put false identities on the internet’ even on social networking sites.

Mr Vaizey added: ‘The way of viewing this issue is that we should work with Facebook to ensure people feel secure using those sites and that there is not a threat of identity theft.

‘It's also important for the government to work with consumers, to educate consumers about the threat of identity theft and what kind of details we should and shouldn't put online,’ he told the BBC.

Simon Milner, Facebook's head of policy in the UK and Ireland, told the conference he had a ‘vigorous chat’ with Mr Smith to persuade him to revise his view.

Labour’s shadow culture minister Helen Goodman said Mr Smith’s comments were ‘totally outrageous’.

‘This is the kind of behaviour that, in the end, promotes crime,’ she told the BBC.

‘It is exactly what we don't want. We want more security online. It's anonymity which facilitates cyber-bullying, the abuse of children.

‘I was genuinely shocked that a public official could say such a thing.’
