A holidaymaker was killed on a motorway after getting out of a car on the  way to the airport following a row with his wife over their credit card.

Nahinmu Nicholas had stormed out of the Ford Focus with his suitcases, saying he was going to hitch-hike to Heathrow, but was knocked down by a lorry in the morning darkness.

His wife had pulled over on what they both thought was the hard shoulder of the M25, not realising that it was a live lane because of roadworks. A coroner was told that lorry driver Martin Hook was unable to avoid Mr Nicholas as he suddenly caught sight of him.

(File picture) An inquest has heard Nahinmu Nicholas died after his wife pulled over on what they both thought was the hard shoulder on the M25. He was then hit by a lorry

His 13-tonne bread lorry also struck 
the couple’s car in the accident just six minutes after they had stopped
 on the clockwise carriageway of the M25 at junction 6 for Godstone,  
Surrey, at around 4.30am on April 10.

Florence
 Olokun-Ola told the inquest in Woking, Surrey, that her husband was 
going to Nigeria alone for 12 days and that the fight started because 
she wanted their bank card while he was away. ‘The argument became very 
aggressive and his voice changed,’ she added.

Mrs
 Olokun-Ola, who had earlier told how financial problems had caused 
tension in their relationship, said she no longer felt comfortable 
driving and pulled over to what she thought was the hard shoulder.

She
 added: ‘He took off his seat belt. As soon as the car stopped he took 
the keys and opened the boot and took out his luggage. He put it by the 
crash barrier.’

In an 
attempt to get her husband back in the car Mrs Olokun-Ola drove forward a
 bit, but he started to walk back down the carriageway  trying to thumb a
 lift.

The couple were on their way to Heathrow Airport near London where Mr Nicholas was going to catch a flight

Then she felt the force of the  collision as the lorry struck the rear of her car.

‘I
 got out the car and at first I was angry because he didn’t come  
running over to see if I was okay,’ she said. She then discovered her  
husband’s body and ran back to the car to dial 999.

Mr
 Hook said he was travelling through the roadworks at 50mph. ‘The next 
thing I knew was there was a dark shadow in front of me,’ he added. ‘I 
turned straight away to the centre of the carriageway.’

A post-mortem examination  concluded that Mr Nicholas died as a result of severe head injuries.

Accident
 reconstruction officer PC Dominic Gibson said that the stretch of the 
M25 where the accident  happened was unlit. He said there were signs 
warning that the hard shoulder was now a live lane.

Assistant
 Surrey Coroner Michael Burgess recorded a verdict that Mr Nicholas, of 
Dartford, Kent, died as a result of a road traffic collision.
