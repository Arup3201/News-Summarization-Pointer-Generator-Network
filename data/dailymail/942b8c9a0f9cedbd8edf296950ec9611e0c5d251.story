Former Army major: Eric Joyce, 54, independent MP for Falkirk, will now face a trial next year

A Member of Parliament today denied assaulting two 14-year-old boys and causing criminal damage during a row at a corner shop.

Eric Joyce, 54, independent MP for Falkirk, will now face a trial next year over allegations he assaulted the boys and caused £200 worth of damage at a store in Chalk Farm, north London.

The ex-Labour party politician formally denied the allegations when they were put to him at Westminster Magistrates’ Court today.

He denied two counts of common assault and one of criminal damage, relating to an alleged incident at the newsagent's in October.

District Judge Margot Coleman conditionally bailed Joyce, a former Army major, to appear for trial at the same court on May 1.

Speaking outside court today after the hearing, Joyce, said: ‘I’m fairly confident.

'I’m not denying the incident took place but it was caught on CCTV and will all be shown in the court so they will be able to make up their own minds. It is a question of interpretation and mine is that I was well within the law.’

Asked if he was disappointed to have to wait until May to try and clear his name, he added: ‘Yes, I didn’t realise it would be as long as that.’

Joyce wore a dark grey suit with a white shirt and red tie in the dock as each of the three charges were put to him.

The court heard the prosecution plans to call the two teenagers and the shop keeper of the News and Food Express as witnesses to the incident.

Judge Coleman listed a trial for half a day on May 1, with a ground rules hearing, at which lawyers will agree the questions to be put to the young witnesses, for March 16.

Joyce is accused of 'assault by beating' of two youths and with causing damage to groceries and confectionery belonging to the shop owner.

He is also charged with 'intending to destroy and damage such property or being reckless as to whether such property would be destroyed or damaged'.

Joyce was released on bail on the conditions he does not contact any witnesses or visit the shop.
