A survey revealed 57% of adults wish they could live in another time. One in five said they'd rather live in the 1960s (model Twiggy pictured in 1967)

Despite the current advancements in medicine, technology and transport, almost 60 per cent of British people would rather live in any other era than the current one.

And when asked which decade they'd prefer to live in, one in five voted for the 1960s.

The decade was also voted as one of the most prosperous in the whole of human history, beating the entire 19th century, and the Roaring Twenties.

Unsurprisingly, the darkest period of history was voted as the Black Death, which killed up to an estimated 200 million people during the 14th century.

The findings were revealed as part of the Yesterday Historical Report commissioned to mark the launch of show Inquisition on the TV channel, Yesterday.

The 1960s were seen as great because of the widespread revolution and change in politics, music and society around the world.

A total of 57 per cent of people said they wish they didn’t live in the current day.

Behind the 1960s was Ancient Rome in second place at 9.9 per cent. 

A further 9.8 per cent said that rock and roll from the 1950s had the biggest draw, while 9.2 per cent also revealed they wanted to experience the roaring 1920s, and 3.2 per cent longed for the 1930s. 

Results were taken from a survey of more than 2,000 British adults, with support from historian Richard Felix.

The 1960s were also voted as one of the most prosperous in human history. The decade was seen as great because of the widespread revolution and change in politics, music and society around the world.

The findings shine a spotlight on the darkest and the most prosperous periods of human history, as well as the top inventions and discoveries.

Although the 1960s was the most recent
 period to make the prosperous list, the Roman period, between 27 BC to 
476 AD, was voted top.

This was because the Roman army put an end to small wars, allowing people to farm and trade in peace.

This was because the Roman army (reconstruction pictured) put an end to small wars, allowing people to farm and trade in peace. They also introduced town planning, baths, toilets and fresh water

The darkest period of history was voted as the Black Death, which killed up to an estimated 200 million people during the 14th century (illustration pictured left). It received half of the votes. Tudor England, between 1485 and 1603, including Henry VIII (illustration pictured right) received 19.7 per cent of the votes

They also introduced town planning, baths, drains, toilets and fresh water supplies.

Behind the Black Death, which sat the top of the darkest period list with more than half the votes, was the Inquisitions of the 12th Century to the 18th Century.

During this time, thousands of people were arrested, tried and executed for heresy by the Roman Catholic Church.

Torture methods such as water boarding, castration and beatings were used to extract confessions.

Although this is the deadliest conflict in history, it united people around the UK. Community spirit within Great Britain was at its highest.

The former resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities, while the latter saw nine million deaths, exacerbated by the advances in technology.

Although the Roman period was seen as most prosperous, it also featured among the darkest periods because the Romans punished and whipped slaves, and enjoyed watching gladiators fight to the death.

The Second World War (former German leader Adolf Hitler is pictured) was voted just ahead of the First, in the darkest period of history list - with 42 per cent of the votes compared to 41.6 per cent

Among the top inventions in human history, electricity (stock image pictured left) was top with 60 per cent of the votes, followed by Alexander Fleming's penicillin (pictured right) on 44 per cent

1. Electricity - 60.0 per cent

2. Penicillin - 44.1 per cent

3. The wheel - 39.1 per cent

4. Internet - 37.4 per cent

5. Computer - 35.3 per cent

6. Printing press - 34.7 per cent

7. Sanitation systems - 34.4 per cent

8. The car - 32.2 per cent

9. Steam engine - 30.2 per cent

10. Airplane - 29 per cent

Emperors were also known for being brutal in their enforcement of their religious views.

Among the top 20 inventions, electricity was top with 60 per cent of the votes, followed by Alexander Fleming's penicillin on 44 per cent.

Surprisingly, both beat the wheel, which received 39 per cent of the votes, and is often credited as the best invention in human history.

All three were also ahead of the internet, computers, and the printing press.

Sanitation systems sat in seventh place, followed by the car, steam engine, and airplanes.

Richard Felix said: ‘It is no surprise the Black Death came out on top in this study; the symptoms included painful blisters, acute fever, vomiting of blood and eventually death.

‘Similarly The Inquisition was a very bloody chapter of European history.’

Adrian Wills, General Manager of Yesterday added: ‘The report shows us the darkest and most gruesome periods of human history should not be forgotten.’

Inquisition is new and exclusive on Yesterday, Wednesdays at 9pm from 16 July.
