It’s a city already renowned for its traffic jams - but just wait to see what happens this weekend.

Los Angeles is bracing itself for gridlock, road rage and other traffic nightmares when a ten-mile stretch of a vital road is closed down and causes what is already being billed as ‘Carmageddon’.

Thousands of doctors and nurses will bunk at hospitals, an emergency operation centre will be set up and Southern California residents are being urged to stay home and stock up on food.

Chaos is expected when a ten-mile stretch of Interstate 405, which links population centres north and south of the Santa Monica Mountains, is shutting down for 53 hours this weekend.

Celebrity actors are among those sounding the alarm to residents of the car-dependent area, via Twitter messages urging residents to stay off the road starting at midnight Friday.

Tom Hanks tweeted: ‘This weekend, LA! Avoid Carmageddon, Gas-zilla, 405-enstein, Grid-lock-apalooza! STAY HOME. Eat & shop local.’ Ashton Kutcher and Erik Estrada also made warnings.

Authorities are hammering the same message to drivers, with freeway electronic signs flashing from last month, warning drivers to ‘EXPECT BIG DELAYS’.

‘The best thing is to stay home if you can, don't drive if you don't have to,’ said Michael Miles, of the California Department of Transportation. ‘Be prepared, treat it like it's a disaster.’

Moshe Shmuel is expecting 120 guests at his wedding on Saturday.

He is worried some people flying in from Israel and South Africa may have trouble getting from the airport to the ceremony in Bel Air. 

He told his guests to leave extra early so they can show up on time.

‘Lucky for us, the rabbi lives close-by,' he said. 'He doesn't need to take the freeway.'

On a typical July weekend, about 500,0000 vehicles use the section of the freeway, known locally as the 405, to get to major destinations such as the airport, beaches and interchanges to other roads.

But transport officials say a full shutdown is necessary to replace the 50-year-old Mulholland Bridge as part of a $1billion project to widen an often-bottlenecked segment through the Sepulveda Pass.

Even if residents can get through this weekend without any trouble, transport authorities expect another closure next year to replace the other half of the span.

Transit officials will offer free rides on the subway and certain bus lines and add more train service.

Officials are stressing real public safety concerns exist, with helipads cleared for air ambulances and 200 extra firemen and paramedics on duty - and some of them positioned along the closed freeway.

Four big hospitals near the freeway on the city's west side are setting up cots and putting thousands of doctors, nurses and medical personnel in hotels and dormitories so they can get to work on time.

The UCLA Health System placed advanced orders for medical supplies and food, with three helicopter firms on standby to transport patients and organs in the event of emergency operations.

Closure: Traffic flows relatively freely last Sunday on Interstate 405 beneath the Mulholland Drive bridge in Los Angeles near sunset - but that will change when 10 miles of the vital artery is closed this weekend

Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa is urging residents to stay close to home and shop locally if they must go out, asking all local residents to ‘chip in and turn this Carmageddon into a unique opportunity’.

One helicopter firm is advertising $150 rides to zip people to downtown and the airport.

And JetBlue is providing $4-$5, half-hour ‘Over the 405’ flights between Long Beach Airport and Bob Hope Airport in Burbank, calling it a ‘planepool’ between the San Fernando Valley and beach.

But the 600 seats available on the four flights - two each going in either direction - sold out within three hours after the promotion was launched on Wednesday, the airline said.

Hotels and restaurants are offering discounts - and cinemas along the freeway are giving away popcorn. A fitness instructor has suggested ‘Carmageddon yoga’ for stressed-out drivers.

Dr Arnold Klein, Michael Jackson's longtime dermatologist, is giving 25 per cent off on Botox injections, and urged people to avoid traffic jams by heading to his office to ‘be more beautiful’.

Dire warnings worked during the 1984 summer Olympics and a 1987 visit by Pope John Paul II, when the city braced itself for the worst, but traffic flowed freely because people avoided driving.
