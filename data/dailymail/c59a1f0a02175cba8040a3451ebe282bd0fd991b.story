An enormous Star Wars X-Wing spaceship has landed in New York's Times Square.

It took 32 master builders more than five million LEGO bricks and took 17,000 hours to put together the full-scale replica of the Star Wars fighter.

The LEGO X-Wing is the largest Lego model in history. It's as big as the real thing and would be capable of fitting the real Luke Skywalker inside.

Landed: Thousands gather in New York City's Times Square to watch the unveiling of the world's largest LEGO Model, a 1:1 replica of the LEGO Star Wars X-wing Starfighter

Extra Large: This Incredible Full Scale Lego X-Wing Is the Largest Model In History

The full scale mode imitates the official $60 Lego 9493 X-Wing Fighter - except it's just 42 times larger.

However instead of just 560-pieces and a few inches in length, this model uses more than five million pieces. It's 11-feet tall, 43-feet long and has a 44-foot wingspan.

The engines also glow and roar as per the films - and you can sit inside.

The Star Wars-themed, 46,000-pound spacecraft arrived in 34 sections by container ship from Kladno in the Czech Republic.

This one can't fly: The model was transported to the United States by boat from the LEGO Model Shop in Kladno, Czech Republic, where it was constructed by a team of 32 builders

Count 'em: The model contains 5,335,200 bricks and is as big as the real thing, capable of fitting the real Luke Skywalker

The model is on display in the middle of Times Square until Saturday.

The X-wing comes complete with a photo booth in the cockpit, engines that light up, and a host of sound effects.

LEGO state: 'The model was heavily engineered to withstand all the transportation, setup/break down and to ensure it was safe for Times Square given the subway system below and Californiaâ€™s seismic requirements for the LEGOLAND California Resort installation.'

The model is so heavy that it requires an internal metal structure to support it.

'Just as kids love to test and hone their LEGO building skills and imaginative storytelling, our LEGO Master Builders are always testing their creative skills to top their last larger-than-life sized creations,' Michael McNally, LEGO's brand relations director explained.

Big brother: The model reproduces the official $60 Lego 9493 X-Wing Fighter. But instead of being 560-pieces and a few inches long, this model uses more than five million pieces

Long term: From conception to completion, the plane took more than one year to make

'The size and structural complexity of a freestanding model 42 times the size of one our retail sets was a challenge they could not resist.'

'I've built pretty big things with LEGO, but this is the biggest ever,' says Lego master builder Erik Varszegi at an unveiling ceremony in Manhattan.

'It's a life-size version,' he added. 'That means the same scale it was built for the film.'

It will will be in position over the weekend and then moved to the West Coast for the remainder of the year. Part the display also includes life-sized LEGO models of Darth Vader, Yoda, and R2D2.

Pilot: The model is so large that budding Luke Skywalker wannabes can sit in the cockpit

Franchise: the model was built to celebrate the forthcoming premiere of the latest Lego Star Wars series The Yoda Chronicles, a three-part animated miniseries launching on Cartoon Network

Although the model is a publicity stunt, the X-Wing unveiling also promotes a series of other projects: The Yoda Chronicles, a new animated Star Wars miniseries on the Cartoon Network, and of course the 2015 movie from J.J. Abrams.

LEGO is now in its 14th year of partnership with Star Wars and has sold more than 200 million building sets, 30 million copies of four video games and 450 different Lego Star Wars mini-figures.

LEGO Star Wars has also played a huge part in boosting the Danish company's profits which have grown by 40 per cent in the past five years. Just ten years ago the toy company was on the verge on bankruptcy.

Perspective: The model is enormous and the largest ever constructed. The X-Wing will move to California next for the rest of the year
