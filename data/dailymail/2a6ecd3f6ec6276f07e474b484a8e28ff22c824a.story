The millionaire owner of Oheka Castle on Long Island has spoken out for the first time since he was shot through the eye in an alleged botched assassination attempt last month.

Gary Melius, 69, released a video on Monday in which he thanked his family, medical team and God – but didn’t say anything about the unusual circumstances in which he was nearly killed two weeks ago.

‘I have a lot to say but I’m not going to say much,’ said Melius, who spoke slowly and wore a clear plastic lens over his left eye and a large bandage on the left side of his head.

‘I got a break. I guess God looked out for me. He always looked out for me. I’m a very spiritual person. I always pray. And I think God for everything that I got,’ he said.

He thanked his family for taking caring for him and his luxury hotel and restaurant while he was in the hospital.

‘My family has been absolutely supportive in taking care of every minute for me. I love them all. My family has bathed me, nursed me, supported me. There is nothing they haven’t done for me. My wife is unbelievable,’ he said.

‘Oheka is alive and well. There hasn’t been a blip. Although I haven’t been around, everything seems perfect.’

He also praised the doctors and nurses who have cared for him while he was in hospital as well as the police investigating the case, adding that he was on the road to a complete recovery.

'I would say that I am a very fortunate man. I’m healing, getting better [and] looking forward to just starting over again,' he said.

Melius was released from the hospital last week. He has vowed to help cops hunt down the masked gunman – but said nothing during the video about suspects or a possible motive.

Moments before Melius was shot on Feb 25, two cars without license plates were seen pulling into the parking lot of his lavish estate. 

A black sedan was seen on surveillance footage appearing to act as a lookout while a gunman in a Jeep Cherokee fired shots at 69-year-old Melius.

The hotelier was shot through the eye while he sat in his Mercedes in an apparent assassination attempt around 12.30pm.

Surveillance cameras on the grounds 
revealed a shooter, wearing a mask and sweatshirt with the hood up, 
getting out of the SUV and firing through Melius' closed window before 
fleeing the scene, according to Newsday.

The
 kickback from firing appeared to cause the gun to jam as the shooter 
was reportedly seen on the security tape trying to fix the gun.

However the high-rolling lifestyle of 
the political mover and shaker might offer some clues - at one time, 
Melius had debts close to $6million. 

According to court records, Melius has
 a history of million-dollar debts - including owing $100,000 for 
unspecified reasons at Donald Trump's Taj Mahal Casino Hotel in Atlantic
 City, New Jersey in 1993.

The Key Bank, the Bank of New York 
and Dime Savings also sued Melius for close to $6million, according to 
filings. The IRS was also after the businessman - suing Melius for 
almost $200,000 in taxes in the early Nineties.  

Friends of  Melius have warned the masked gunman to turn himself in.

'We
 are going to find the guy who did this,' best friend Darren Aquino told
 MailOnline the day after the shooting.

'This is not a sane man (the gunman). What kind of normal 
person would do that? The 
best thing he could do, this man, is turn himself in.'

Aquino described Melius, who he met at an event 10 years ago, as 'charitable', but admitted his wealth exposed him to threats.

'We don't know about motive for sure 
yet. Listen, people who are such a character like Gary are always a 
target. They always are,' he said.

'He's
 a good charitable man. He's the most giving guy I know. He's my best 
friend. I'm happy he got through this.'

Aquino said Melius is 'doing well' and surrounded by loved ones at North Shore Hospital in Manhattan.

Meanwhile, authorities are examining 
surveillance footage from the Gilded Age estate on Long Island's Gold 
Coast that has hosted the wedding of disgraced Congressman Anthony 
Weiner and closing scenes of Orson Welles movie, Citizen Kane.

Kelly Melius drover her father to hospital after she found him with a gunshot wound.

Last year, Melius was part of a controversy that resulted in the ousting of then-Nassau County Police Commissioner Thomas Dale over the arrest of a witness in an election lawsuit.

The district attorney found that Dale had instructed officers to arrest a 29-year-old Roosevelt man, who had testified in an unrelated case that he had been paid to collect signatures for a third-party candidate.

Melius, a supporter of the third-party candidate, then contacted Dale seeking to have the young man investigated.

The young man was arrested on an outstanding warrant while riding a county bus on October 5.

An investigation by the Nassau County district attorney found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing but raised questions about the ethics of Dale's actions, leading to his resignation.

His close friend, former U.S. Senator Alfonse D'Amato was waiting to meet Melius for a meal at a local steakhouse when he was informed of his friends shooting.

'It was not a robbery,' Mr D'Amato said after leaving Melius' bedside according to Newsday.

'It was an attempt at assassination. He was at the Castle, outside. Nobody put a gun to him or said, 'We want your money.' They just shot him. The guy had a mask on.' 

Born in Queens, New York City, Melius began his career as a plumber, before getting himself into construction and property.

Becoming successful, Melius made a move for Oheka in the mid-1980s.

Melius
 lives on the sprawling estate along with his wife Pam and daughter 
Kelly and purchased the castle in 1984 for $1.5 million.

He sold it a few years later for $30 million but then regained ownership in 2003 - paying the same price
