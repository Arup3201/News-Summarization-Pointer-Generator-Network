The leader of the Granite Mountain Hotshot crew, the team of 19 firefighters killed after getting trapped in a fierce Arizona inferno last month, has been accused of violating wildfire safety protocols.

Eric Marsh, together with 18 of his colleagues perished in the Yarnell Hill Fire on June 30.

Now the deputy director of the Arizona State Forestry Division, Jerry Payne, has said he believes Marsh, 43, ‘violated several basic wildfire rules including not knowing the location of the fire, not having a spotter observing the fire and leading his crew through thick, unburned vegetation near a wildfire.’

“The division supervisor broke those rules and put those people at risk,” Payne told InvestigativeMedia.com.

Firefighters are expected to follow the '10 Standard Fire Orders’ and ’18 Watch Out Situations’ at all times, according to the National Interagency Fire Center, which coordinates wildfire management operations across the country.

Payne said he believed Marsh felt he had time to lead the Hotshots from a safe area on a ridge when the fire was a mile or two away.

'It was a calculated risk. They didn’t even make it halfway,' Payne said.

'It was a serious miscalculation, in my opinion. It was an honest mistake.'

Nevertheless, Payne said Marsh knew that he 'should have had somebody watching the fire.'

Payne said Marsh communicated with their lookout, Brendan McDonough, to make sure he had an escape route.

McDonough then left his position to join the Blue Ridge Hotshots nearby as the fire approached. He was the only member of the Granite Mountain Hotshot crew to survive.

Neither Payne nor the Arizona State Forestry Division is not part of the team investigation the fire.

His comments have been called into question by Carrie Templin, the public information officer for the investigation team.

She told ABC15 that only a 72-hour report on the fire has been issued and she didn’t know what information Payne was basing his claims on.

The official report into what happened isn’t expected until September.

Following Templin’s comments, Payne backtracked slightly and claimed his comments to InvestigativeMedia.com were misinterpreted.

He said that he did not intend to blame Marsh and that a break in standard firefighting guidelines is something that can happen in special circumstances.
