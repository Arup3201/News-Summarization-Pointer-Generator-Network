A man, who was wearing a dress and crotchless pants, has been charged after he tried to rob an Australian sex store on Saturday morning.

The 34-year-old man forced his way through the ceiling of the store in Brisbane when he set off an alarm, police said.

When he was caught by a female manager of the store, the man allegedly attacked the woman with sex toys.

The man was also wearing a wig when he entered the Totally Adult Shop on Gympie Road in Aspley at 5.20am, The Australian reported.

Police said the man was trying to steal the sex toys but threw them at the owner when she confronted him.

The thief then tried to flee the scene by climbing back through the ceiling and onto the roof where he was arrested by police.

The Murrumba Downs man has been charged with break and enter and possessing dangerous drugs.

Earlier this week, another man fell through a sex shop roof during a botched burglary in Cairns.

The 22-year-old man allegedly grabbed a Fantasy Fetish pack, which contained items including a saddle, after crashing through the ceiling in the early hours of Thursday.

Witnesses alerted police who then arrested the man nearby.

He faced a Cairns court on Friday on five theft and burglary related charges.
