The 44-year-old was flown to hospital by air ambulance after being struck three times by the snake in Dalby Forest.

The victim, who has not been named, was treated at the scene by paramedics.

Alan Eves, of the Forestry Commission, said Dalby Forest has a ‘thriving population’ of the snakes.

Although
 an adder’s venom poses little danger to healthy adults, the bites can 
be extremely painful and require urgent  medical attention.

The last person to die from an adder bite in Britain is believed to have been a five-year-old child in Scotland in 1975.

In the wild, their venom immobilises small prey such as lizards, amphibians, nestlings and small mammals.

Adders strike and then leave the venom to take effect, before returning to devour their prey.

Last month, an 11-year-old boy was bitten by a poisonous snake as he went to retrieve his football from a bramble bush.

Carl Jefferies was playing near his home outside Bolton, in Lancashire, when he lost the ball on a grassy area.

As he went to retrieve it, an adder sank its fangs into his left leg. He was treated successfully in hospital.
