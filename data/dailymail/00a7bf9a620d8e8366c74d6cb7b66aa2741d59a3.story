'Suing God': Rev Mark Sharpe, 47, who has been given permission to take legal action against the church after he was 'hounded out of his parish'

A village vicar who says he was bullied by parishioners for four years and forced out of his job has won permission to 'sue God'.

Reverend Mark Sharpe, 47, claims his dog was poisoned, his telephone lines were cut and his tyres slashed because he was considered an 'outsider'.

The vicar, who likened local residents to characters out of the League of Gentleman, accused the church of failing to support him in the remote country parish in Teme Valley South, near Tenbury Wells, Worcestershire.

In a move reminiscent of the Billy 
Connolly film ‘The Man Who Sued God’, Rev Sharpe tried to 
sue for constructive dismissal.

He was refused permission to take legal action against the church when a tribunal judge upheld centuries old ecclesiastical laws which say the clergy are not employees but office holders ‘employed by God.’

But the decision was overturned yesterday by a judge yesterday at the Employment Appeal Tribunal in London - paving the way for Rev Sharpe to sue the church.

The vicar claims that animal excrement was smeared on his car, glass was smashed on the driveway, heating oil was stolen and he was threatened on the doorstep of the rectory by a parishioner.

He says he was forced to install CCTV cameras at the rectory with his wife Sara after being constantly plagued by prowlers following their move with their four children in 2005.

One church warden even objected to Rev Sharpe’s beard, warning him that locals wanted a ‘clean shaven clergyman’, he claimed.

He took sick leave in April 2006, which continued until he resigned in 2009 and he is not currently working.The former Royal Navy chaplain - who once
successfully sued the Ministry of Defence after just 24 days at sea - 
is now taking action against the Bishop and Diocese of Worcester.

The reverend joined the priesthood when he left his former job as a police dog handler in 2001. His next role was with the Royal Navy as a chaplain but he quit and later won a sexual harassment tribunal.

In that case he said he was forced to turn a blind eye to widespread use of porn and was awarded a five-figure pay-out.

Rev Sharpe, who is being supported by the
faith workers section of the Unite union, claims he was effectively 
forced out of his parish and that the bishop and diocese of Worcester 
did nothing to protect him.

The church initially admitted in 2008 that Rev Sharpe was a worker entitled to bring a claim, but changed their mind in 2012 and asked for permission to withdraw that concession.

Judge Alan McGarry ruled in favour of the church at an employment tribunal in Birmingham.

However that ruling was overturned by Mrs Justice Cox on appeal and the case will now have to be reheard by the lower tribunal, if a settlement is not reached first.

Speaking after his victory, Rev Sharpe 
said: 'This decision has come as an immense relief. I never intended to 
set out on this journey, but I was forced down this route in order to 
seek recompense for my family and I.

'I feel vindicated by the stand that Unite has taken on my behalf and hope to move to a swift resolution of the outstanding issues with the church, so that I can move forward to the next chapter of my life.'

Unite national officer Rachael Maskell said: 'This is a very welcome decision that vindicates Mark’s brave stand over the last eight years, not only in ministering to his parish, but fighting for compensation after he unfairly lost his job.'

A spokesperson for the Church of England said: 'In the light of the Supreme Court decision in relation to Ministers in the Methodist church, the judge has decided not to uphold the original judgement.

'She has ruled that the case should be reconsidered by the Employment Tribunal, in accordance with the legal principles as set out in her judgement.'
