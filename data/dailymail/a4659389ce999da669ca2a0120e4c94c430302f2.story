The body of a Washington D.C. police officer who was accused of child porn has been recovered from the Potomac River.

Officer Marc Washington was pulled from the water just before 9 p.m. Tuesday after U.S. Park Police received a call about a person in the water.

Sources say court documents belonging to Washington were found inside a rental car near the scene. Clothing was also found nearby.

Found in the river: Marc Washington, 32, arrested last week on child porn charges after he visited the home of a teenage girl who had previously been reported missing

Washington, 32, was arrested last week
on child porn charges after he visited the home of a teenage girl who 
had previously been reported missing, ordered her to remove her clothing
and took photos of her, all while he was on duty.

The
girl told her mother what happened shortly after Washington left her 
family's home. The mother called authorities, and Washington was 
arrested within hours.

He was released from prison this week, placed on house arrest and ordered to wear a GPS monitoring device.

Washington was apparently still wearing the GPS device on his ankle when he was pulled from the water.

Cops
had been looking for more victims to come forward after police 
investigators found hundreds of photos of naked women, mostly victims of
domestic violence, on Washington’s digital camera.

Those
photos date back to at least 2011 and police say some of the alleged 
victims may have been subjected to domestic violence, whilst other may 
been minors.

Police have put another officer on desk duty as they investigate whether he tipped off Washington about his impending arrest.

According
to the Washington Post a police dispatcher had also inadvertently sent 
text of the mother’s complaint to computer screens of officers 
throughout the 7th District, where Washington was assigned.

Court
charging documents allege that Washington deleted pictures of the girl 
and others before police arrested him, but that investigators were able 
to retrieve most of the images.

Police
also said they found pictures of other females, including two who 
appeared to be minors, and were urging people to call with information.

Prosecutors
argued that Washington posed a threat to the community because his 
alleged actions occurred while he was on duty and armed. His attorney 
said that without his gun and badge, Washington posed no danger. He 
faced up to 30 years in federal prison if convicted.

Police say the investigation into Washington's death is ongoing.
