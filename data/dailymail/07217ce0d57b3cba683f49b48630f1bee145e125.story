Police in Chicago have launched a murder investigation after a 98-year-old former nurse was found to have died of morphine and hydrocodone toxicity while living in a care home. 

The Cook County medical examiner has investigated three suspicious deaths at the Holland Home in South Holland, Chicago. 

Six residents at the care home were all hospitalised on February 3 with former nurse Dorothy Byrd, 98, Robert Rundin, 88, and 98-year-old Leon Krynicki all dying.

Frank Shuftan of the Cook County Medical Examiner's office said Mrs Byrd's death was caused by morphine and hydrocodone toxicity, combined with hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. 

An autopsy performed immediately after Mrs Byrd's death was inconclusive but further toxicology tests discovered a fatal dose of painkillers in her system. 

Mrs Byrd's daughter Sandra Peterson said she cannot understand why anyone would want to kill her mother, who was a former nurse. 

She told Fox Chicago: 'There aren't words that adequately describe the shock and the horror and just the inability to comprehend the who, what, why just many many questions

Mrs Byrd, pictured, was one of six patients to fall ill in February at the Chicago nursing home

'She loved sweets and so on that day I brought her a couple of slices of cake and some cookies and she just sat there eating it and enjoying it and I left saying I'll see you tomorrow.'

Ms Peterson said her mother died the following day despite seeming in good form during her visit.  

The family's lawyer Tom Paris said: 'She has taught nurses, she's been a nurse to nurses, she has been a nurse to thousands of patients. Ultimately Dorothy Byrd was betrayed by a nurse.'

According to Mr Paris, the nurse on duty at the time of the deaths has been suspended as have two nursing assistants.  

Emergency services were called to the nursing home on the morning of February 3 when six patients fell ill. 

Investigators are preforming further tests on Mr Rundin's body who died on March 7, more than a month after he fell ill. 

David Mills, chief operating officer of Villa Healthcare who run the Holland Home confirmed they are helping authorities with their investigation.
