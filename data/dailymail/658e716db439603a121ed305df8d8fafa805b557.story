Computer games company Nintendo has apologised for leaving same-sex relationships out of a 'life simulator' game after criticism by equality activists.

Protestors attacked the publisher for not including the option of having gay relationships in Tomodachi Life, a Sims-style title which lets players create characters and populate and island with them.

Marketing material for the game, which is for the handheld 3DS console, boasts the the cartoonish characters can 'rap, rock, eat donuts, fall in love, break up, go shopping, play games, and live their crazy lives'.

However, American gamer Tye Marini, 23, found that there was an element of his life he could not recreate in the game - his relationship with his boyfriend.

Mr Marini uploaded a video saying: 'I wanted to be able to marry 
my real-life fiance’s Mii. You import your personalised characters into 
the game. You name them.

'You give them a personality. You give them a voice. They just can’t fall in love if they’re gay.'

But although the company accepted that 
it had failed to 'represent' its audience fully, it said it was not 
possible to add a gay marriage feature into the game after it has completed.

It instead pledged to add the option to marry within the same sex should it release a sequel to Tomodachi Life, which was released last year in Japan and will released in America and Europe next month.

Pledge: Nintendo has said that if it released a sequel to the game in will make sure to include same-sex relationships

A spokesman said: 'We apologise for disappointing many people by failing to include same-sex relationships in Tomodachi Life.

'Unfortunately, it is not possible for us to change this game’s design, and such a significant development change can’t be accomplished with a post-ship patch.

'We pledge that if we create a next instalment in the Tomodachi series, we will strive to design a game-play experience from the ground up that is more inclusive, and better represents all players.'

Campaigners welcomed the move, but said Nintendo had responded slowly compared to other games publishers.

Titles including fantasy series Fable and The Elder Scrolls, as well as The Sims and sci-fi game Mass Effect have long included the potential for same-sex relationships.
