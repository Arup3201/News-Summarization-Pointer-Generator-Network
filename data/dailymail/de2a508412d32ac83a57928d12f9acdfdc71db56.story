Royal Bank of Scotland was accused of ‘learning nothing’ from the financial crisis after being fined £14.5million for giving unsuitable mortgage advice to tens of thousands of its customers.

The City watchdog said the sales processes of RBS and subsidiary NatWest were not ‘fit for purpose’ and listed a series of astonishing failings that lasted until March 2013.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said that about 30,000 customers were exposed to unsuitable advice. RBS has agreed to contact them to ask them if they have any concerns. 

The Royal Bank of Scotland has been fined £14.5 million after the City regulator found 'serious failings' in its advice to mortgage customers

In one case an adviser told a customer interest rates could hit 5.5 per cent and recommended they lock into a more expensive fixed-rate loan for five years.

Advisers also routinely failed to check whether households could afford to repay their loans. This included older customers who were set to retire before the end of the term of the mortgage. Just two of a sample of 164 sales reviewed by the FCA were deemed to be suitable.

The problems were flagged up to RBS by the regulator in November 2011, but were not rectified until March 2013. 

Tracey McDermott, director of enforcement and financial crime at the FCA, said: ‘Taking out a mortgage is one of the most important financial decisions we can make.

‘Poor advice could cost someone their home so it’s vital that the advice process is fit for purpose. Both firms failed to ensure that their customers were getting the best advice for them.’

John Mann, a Labour member of the influential Treasury Select Committee, said the sanction was not tough enough. ‘This fine is peanuts for RBS,’ he said. ‘We need a criminal investigation. 

Ross McEwan, who ran the RBS retail unit from August 2012 until his promotion to group chief executive in October last year, said the mortgage advice failings were 'unacceptable and should never have happened'

‘This bank obviously hasn’t learned its lessons from the financial crisis and no one has had the decency to take responsibility for wrongdoing.' 

It is the sixth time in four years that the state-backed lender has been fined, having already been penalised for rigging Libor interest rates and breaching rules against money laundering. 

RBS has said in response to the findings at the end of 2012, it overhauled its mortgage sales process and re-trained all mortgage advisers (file picture)

But the catalogue of failings in its mortgage advice is arguably the most damaging for the high street giant, which is currently on a mission to boost its mortgage lending and win back the public’s trust. 

Banks, including RBS, were blamed for triggering the financial crisis, in part by lending recklessly to households and businesses that could not afford to pay back the money. 

In its report, the FCA revealed this reckless approach had continued, with sales staff at RBS and NatWest failing to go through basic checks to determine whether customers could afford a mortgage. 

Instead of checking a customer’s income and outgoings, RBS sales staff relied heavily on generic information on household spending published by the Office for National Statistics.

They also lent money to customers in financial difficulty who were seeking to consolidate their debts into their mortgage.

In one case, a salesman committed 16 ‘professional standards failings’ of which ten were considered to be ‘detrimental’ to the customer.

Despite this the salesman was given ‘back-to-basics coaching’ and allowed to continue to sell to the public.

The bank said yesterday it had ‘completely overhauled’ its sales process and in November 2012 put around 350 mortgage advisers on an intensive four-month training course during which time they were not allowed to provide advice.

Chief executive Ross McEwan admitted that the service had been ‘unacceptable and should never have happened’.
