TV bosses are reportedly begging disgraced comic Justin Lee-Collins to make his TV comeback on Celebrity Big Brother for a lucrative £100,000 fee - sparking fury from his ex-girlfriend's family.

Comedian Collins was convicted of harassing ex Anna Larke during a seven month 'abuse campaign'.

If the 38-year-old accepted he would reportedly join Katie Price, Meatloaf and X Factor reject Rylan Clark, who are expected to appear in January's show.

'Tacky': Disgraced comic Justin Lee Collins has not appeared on TV since he was convicted of harassing ex Anna Larke (pictured in October after the guilty verdict)

Anna told The Sun newspaper producers 
were 'rewarding Collins for his abhorrent behaviour with the offer of 
£100,000 to appear in the house.'

She added: 'The whole idea is just tacky and irreverent.

Her family have put together a petition which they will send into Channel 5, pleading with them to withdraw the lucrative offer.

Her brother Alex added: 'It’s 
disgusting that Channel 5 have selected him because of his conviction to
boost their flagging ratings for Big Brother.'

During the trial, Anna had told St 
Albans Crown Court how Justin had had spat in her face, yanked her hair 
back, hit her between her legs and slapped her in the face causing 
'hundreds' of bruises.

She said he forced her to close down 
her email and Facebook accounts, sleep facing him, compile an explicit 
dossier of her former lovers and throw away DVDs starring actors she 
found attractive.

Secret recordings were played in which
Collins swore at Miss Larke calling her a '****ing slag', 'dirty vile 
whore' and '****ing coke head'.

The jury heard that at one point 
Collins told her: 'When you're with me you look at the ****ing ground, 
you look at a tree ... you don't look at any other ****ing human being.'

A jury of nine women and two men 
decided Collins was guilty of a single charge of harassment causing Miss
Larke fear of violence on at least two occasions. The majority verdict 
came after almost 12 hours of deliberation and after one juror was 
dismissed.

He was found guilty of harassment and sentenced to 140 hours unpaid work and ordered to pay £3,500 in prosecution costs.

A spokesman for Collins declined to comment.
