Crystal Palace fans have been urged to trust the judgement of co-chairman Steve Parish over the return of Neil Warnock as manager.

Parish has been heavily criticised for his decision to bring Warnock back to Selhurst Park following the departure of Tony Pulis just before the start of the season.

But Parish's fellow co-chairman Stephen Browett is convinced the right man has been appointed and appealed to disgruntled fans to support him.

Trust him: Crystal Palace's co-chairman Stephen Browett is convinced Neil Warnock is the right man 

Browett told the South London Press: 'People need to trust his [Parish's] judgement. He has got everything spot on so far.

'If anyone is doubting the Neil Warnock appointment then just go back to the internet posters when Tony [Pulis] got the job - it was the same then. Steve was accused of going mad.

'Steve works incredibly hard for Palace and refuses to be rushed into anything. He doesn't do spur of the moment. As soon as Tony left he spent all his time interviewing and taking advice from people within the game.

'Steve is tough as old boots and very thick-skinned. He has thought long and hard who he wanted as maanger before coming to this conclusion. He has got the full backing of the rest of us.'

'Thick-skinned': Browett says his co-chairman Steve Parish took due care and consideration before appointing Warnock for a second spell at Selhurst Park

Pulis, who guided Palace from a precarious position in the Premier League relegation zone to a final position of 11th last season, was allowed to leave on the eve of the season.

After Keith Millen took caretaker charge for the opening two matches of the season, Parish announced the return of Warnock on a two-year contract at the end of August.

Warnock was at the helm between 2007 and 2010, guiding the Eagles to the Championship play-off semi-finals in 2008 before departing for QPR when the club went into adminstration.

And Browett insists he is the correct choice: 'He is a sensible fit. Neil is very, very experienced and is not a million miles away from Tony Pulis in management style and experience.

Saviour: Tony Pulis guided Palace from the Premier League relegation zone to 11th last season but was allowed to leave the club before the start of the current campaign 

'We didn’t want radical change from what we had under Tony.

'With the group of lads we’ve got and the fantastic team spirit there, it was really important to have as little disruption as possible - albeit that when a manager walks out two days before the season starts it is impossible to have no disruption.

'Neil is a safe pair of hands - he is not going to try and reinvent the wheel.'

Palace, who drew 3-3 at Newcastle United in Warnock's first match, host Burnley on Saturday. 

Meanwhile, midfielder Owen Garvan has moved to loan to Bolton for three months. The 26-year-old featured once for Palace this campaign, in the 3-0 Capital One Cup victory against Walsall, but wasn't selected in Warnock's 25-man squad for the Premier League season.
