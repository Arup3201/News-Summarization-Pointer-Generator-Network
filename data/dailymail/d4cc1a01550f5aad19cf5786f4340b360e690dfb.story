A couple's £3,000 state-of-the art sofa started a blaze which swept through their home killing their pet dog.  

Fire fighters discovered the body of Ross and Kim Marvin's four-year-old pet after they battled their way through  flames and thick black smoke.

The Jack Russell and Chihuahua cross was overcome by fumes, after the inferno was sparked by an electrical fault in the couch.

The couple are now planning to sue sofa giants ScS after they claim they have 'been left with nothing' after the blaze.

The Marvin's brought the Endurance Invincible sofa, which contained a Bluetooth-capable sound system with speaker and sub woofer, from furniture giant ScS for £3,149.

Mr Marvin, a recruitment consultant, said: 'If it had happened while we were sleeping we would be dead.' 

The 28-year-old told how he was fought back by the choking black smoke after arriving home and discovering the blaze.

'I thought the curtains were drawn at first, it was that black,' he said.

'I went round the back to the kitchen because I knew Rolo was inside.

'I went in through the smoke - you couldn't see your hand in front of your face. I only got as far as the kitchen table before I had to come outside.

'I nearly passed out and had to lean on a fence to recover. The firemen offered me oxygen, but I gradually recovered.'

Rolo was found by fire fighters in an upstairs bedroom at the couple's home in Wigston, Leicester, and despite fire fighters efforts was declared dead.

'We've had him (Rolo) since he was a pup,' said Mrs Marvin, aged 29 years.

'He was a wedding present to ourselves.

'It's just devastating, Rolo was like my little baby. We treated him just like a baby.

'The only consolation is we're still here. If it had happened at a different time of day, it could have been a different story.'

A spokesman for Leicester Fire and Rescue Service confirmed that the cause of the fire was accidental and started following an electrical fault within the sofa unit.  

The Marvins', who had no contents insurance, now face a hefty bill to repair the damage to their rented semi-detached home.

ScS have  stopped the stricken couple's monthly repayments on the sofa and offered them new furniture.

'I'm afraid their offer is not acceptable,' said Mr Marvin.

'We have lost everything in the fire and now we've been told the landlord is holding us responsible because it was our sofa that started the fire.'

'The landlord's agent called us and said sorry for our loss and asked what state the house was in.

'They told us we would have to meet the cost of all the damage to the landlord's property - and carry on paying rent.

'But a clause in the tenancy agreement says the landlord is responsible for insuring the property and his own contents. We have no insurance on the property.'

A spokeswoman for ScS said: 'Our thoughts are entirely with the family at this time. We have offered to assist them if we can.

'We do not know what the cause of the fire was, and a full investigation is required. As such, it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.'
