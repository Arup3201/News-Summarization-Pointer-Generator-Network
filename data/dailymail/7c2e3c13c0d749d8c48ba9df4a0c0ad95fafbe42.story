A violent thug who killed a vulnerable man with a single punch during a row over a bicycle could have his sentence extended following an investigation by the Attorney General.

Lewis Gill was sentenced to just four years in prison over the death of Andrew Young, whose mother described the jail term as an 'absolute joke'.

After multiple people complained to the Attorney General's Office, officials announced today that they will review the sentence - which will allow the killer to walk free within just two years.

Announcement: The Attorney General's Office said today that it would review the sentence

A spokesman said: 'The Attorney General's Office has received a number of requests to look at the sentence given to Lewis Gill.

'If
 a sentence given in a Crown Court appears to be very low, or unduly 
lenient, anyone can ask the Attorney General to examine the sentence, 
within 28 days of sentencing.

'This process has now started. We have asked the CPS to send us more information on this case.'

The sentence was imposed by Judge Keith Cutler, who was criticised for his handling of the inquest into the gangster Mark Duggan, whose shooting by police sparked the riots of 2011.

Victims' Commissioner Baroness Newlove urged officials to bear in mind the ordeal suffered by Mr Young's family since his death.

'I'm appalled by this disgraceful act of violence - my thoughts go out to the victims' family and friends at this time,' she said. 'It's entirely right that the sentence will be reviewed for this shocking crime.

'I know how traumatic it is to go through the courts as a victim when you are already so hurt and vulnerable. That's why I urge everyone involved in this case to put victims first in the pursuit of justice.'

Mr Young (left), who suffered from Asperger's Syndrome, was said to be able to speak several languages but had the social skills of a 14-year-old due to his condition. Gill (right) pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter and was jailed for four-and-a-half years

Mr Young became involved in an argument with cyclist Victor Ibitoye after he told him that cycling on the pavement was dangerous

The shocking incident took place on a 
busy street in Bournemouth when Mr Young, 40, warned Victor Ibitoye that 
riding on the pavement was dangerous.

When the conversation ended Lewis Gill, who was with Mr Ibitoye, punched Mr Young, taking him by surprise.

Distressing CCTV footage shows the Asperger’s sufferer toppling back on to the road, violently striking his head.

After the hearing Mrs Young said her son (pictured) did not cause Gill 'any harm'

Gill,
 who has a conviction for handling stolen goods as well as robbery, then
 walks away, with a glance back at his motionless victim.

Passers-by came to Mr Young’s aid but he died the following day in hospital. His mother Pamela was at his bedside.

Yesterday Gill, 20, pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter for which he was jailed for just four years.

Mrs Young said: ‘You can see Andrew didn’t cause Lewis Gill any harm.

‘I
 wish that awful man who took my son away had pleaded not guilty so he 
would have got a longer sentence. The sentence is an absolute joke.

‘I’m a committed Christian but I think that if someone takes a life they should be prepared to forfeit their own.’

She said that too few killers served full sentences.

Tory
 MP David Davies said of Gill’s punishment: ‘That’s an outrageously lean
 sentence. In two years he will be out walking the streets after taking 
somebody’s life.

‘He has
 attacked someone unprovoked and should be properly punished. People 
need to realise if you punch someone like that, and they fall backward, 
they can die.’

Explaining
 why Gill would receive just four years, Judge  Cutler told him: ‘What I
 have had to look at is what was in your mind at the time you threw that
 punch.

‘You wanted to 
cause some injury to Mr Young. If you wanted to cause grievous bodily 
harm it would have been a murder charge. You are very, very lucky that 
was not in fact the outcome.’

The judge told the hearing at Salisbury Crown Court on Friday that the case lay somewhere between murder and manslaughter.

‘I bear in mind your early guilty plea. I accept there is no pre-meditated element and provocation does exist,’ he told Gill.

Keith Cutler made a controversial decision to hold a 20-second silence for Mark Duggan

The judge who sentenced Lewis Gill was at the centre of the Mark Duggan inquest that ended in January.

At
 the start of the hearing, Keith Cutler made the controversial decision 
to hold a 20-second silence to acknowledge the ‘regrettable loss of a 
young life’.

The death of Duggan, a gangster who was shot twice by police marksmen, sparked the London riots that broke out in summer 2011.

The
 senior circuit judge led the silence – virtually unprecedented at an 
inquest – by lowering his head and clasping his hands together.

He
 later explained: ‘It was my idea. I know it was controversial, and I 
know the police were bristling about it and sections of the media were 
very critical, but I believe that Mark Duggan’s death led to a great 
deal of unrest.

‘I thought that a few moments’ reflection at the start of the inquest might be quite healing.’

He
 also said he would ask the dead man’s family to help shape 
recommendations on police firearms procedure. Jurors were given special 
protection by police as they left the Royal Courts of Justice, following
 the intimidation and abuse they faced from Duggan’s supporters during 
the hearing.

There were claims the judge had treated the Duggan family with ‘kid gloves’ during the inquest which ended last month.

Judge
 Cutler once admitted that he enjoys having the power to show leniency. 
And he has reacted angrily to criticism from Government ministers who 
accused judges of ‘soft’ sentencing.

The response came in 2006 in his role as secretary of the Council of Circuit Judges.

The married father-of-two is a Christian who was installed as a lay canon of Salisbury Cathedral in 2009.

The Duggan inquest ended with an 8-2 majority jury verdict that his death was a lawful killing.

 

After the hearing, Mr Young's mother Pamela described the sentence as a 'joke'

The
 maximum sentence for manslaughter is life, but the term can be shorter,
 at the discretion of the judge. With half his sentence served on 
licence, and allowing for time already served, Gill could be out of jail
 in under two years.

The
 judge told Gill, from Sutton, Surrey, that Mr Young was no threat: ‘You
 are a powerfully built young man. You must have known that [the punch] 
was going to cause a significant injury and, very sadly, it did.’

Gill was also sentenced to two three-month terms to run consecutively with the manslaughter sentence.

This
 was for committing the crime while on a suspended sentence for the 
robbery and handling offences. In mitigation, Steven Perian said: ‘He 
wishes he could turn back the clock and not react in the way he did.’

Mr
 Young, a former grammar school pupil, regular church-goer and speaker 
of several languages, was said to have the social skills of a 
14-year-old due to his Asperger’s.

Taxi
 driver Simon Scott said of him: ‘Andrew was always friendly and polite 
and often struck up conversations with strangers. He was gentle and 
wouldn’t hurt a fly.’

His
 mother added: ‘He was very particular because of his Asperger’s and he 
wouldn’t have liked seeing someone riding a bicycle on the pavement.’

The incident took place outside a Tesco Express in the Charminster area of Bournemouth at 4.25pm on November 6.
