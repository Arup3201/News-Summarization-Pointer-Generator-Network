The Spanish football federation, the RFEF, has announced that its referees will use vanishing spray in the country's top two leagues from the beginning of this season.

The spray, which consists mainly of water and butane, is used by referees to stop players encroaching at free-kicks. It evaporates within a matter of seconds.

Versions of the spray were trialled in England in the 1980s but it never became a permanent feature of the game. Three decades on, that appears to be changing across Europe.

World Cup: The spray is used to ensure the Croatian wall remains 10 yards from the position of the free-kick

The Italian football federation have already announced that they will use the spray in Serie A and Serie B while the Bundesliga and Ligue 1 are also expected to adopt the spray in the near future.

The FA have given no suggestion that they will follow suit but with it being used so effectively at the World Cup in Brazil there appears to be little rational opposition to its use.

Vanish: The spray disappears after less than a minute

Chairman: Greg Dyke has given no indication that the FA wishes to adopt the spray
