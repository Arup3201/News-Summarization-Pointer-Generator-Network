The teenage student who watched her legs get severed at the knees while she attempted to jump aboard a moving freight train has thanked her rescuers four months after the near-fatal accident.

Anna Beninati, 18, of Sandy, Utah, was studying music therapy at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, and was trying to board the 18mph train with three male friends last September in Longmont.

But the student, who had train hopped almost a dozen times before, slipped and fell beneath its steel wheels as she tried to board and her legs were crushed under the 118-car train.

‘I remember looking down at my leg dragging on the ground and I saw how fast the wheels were turning and how fast the rails were going by,’ she said, reported the Longmont Times-Call.

’It almost occurred to me, and I was like, “Oh my god, I am gonna get”… and then it happened. I remember sitting there looking at my legs.

She remembered being under the train for six seconds at the most, thinking to herself immediately after: 'A: What do I do now? B: What did I just do to myself?’

The four friends had visited Denver on Labor Day weekend and they had been given a ride by one of the young men’s fathers to Longmont on the way back to CSU, reported the Longmont Times-Call.

But the father was unaware of the group’s plan to jump aboard a train from there to Fort Collins. Anna said their idea was quite common and the railway goes through the university campus.

The student, who was 17 at the time, had just seen one friend make it onto the train and another slip but roll away to safety. She decided to go for it, despite concerns she ‘might not fare so well’.

‘I remember watching that and thinking: “Something tells me I shouldn't be running right now, something tells me that is going to happen to me”. I had this feeling and I went for it, anyway.’

One of her friends, Charlie Hamilton, 25, a former Army medic, pulled her from underneath the train and two hospital staff, who were stopped at a rail crossing, ran over to help him begin first aid.

The employees at Longmont United Hospital - Nicole Crowley and Kathy Poiry - were honoured along with others at a ceremony on Saturday, reported the Longmont Times-Call.

‘I never would have made it this far if it weren't for these guys,’ Anna said she realised when she turned 18 on Christmas Eve last month. She has had 11 surgeries on her legs since the accident.

Anna, who has since been studying online courses at CSU, has even been skiing with Wasatch Adaptive Sports in Utah and is intending to compete with a mono-ski in a tournament in March.

'I cannot say enough stuff about how proud I am of Anna'

She has been playing piano, guitar and bassoon and has spoken in her younger brother’s elementary school class about safety issues.

‘She has always been amazing, but now she is super amazing,’ her mother Debbie Beninati said, reported the Longmont Times-Call. ‘I cannot say enough stuff about how proud I am of Anna.’

Anna added: ‘I witnessed the whole entire thing. I have vivid memory of the entire thing.’
