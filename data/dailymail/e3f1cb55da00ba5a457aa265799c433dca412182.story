Christine Francis lost control of her horse, Nelson, and was thrown from the creature

A grandmother died after being thrown from the horse that she adored on her first ride out on the animal for six months.

Christine Francis, 55, lost control of her horse Nelson after farm machinery spooked the animals ridden by her and her husband John as they travelled along Cortworth Lane, Wentworth, South Yorks, yards from their family home.

At Rotherham Coroners Court on Wednesday, Mr Francis revealed how tragedy struck as they returned from his wife's first ride since a knee replacement operation six months earlier.

He said: 'We got almost to the bottom of the lane that leads to Cortworth House when what I thought was a combine harvester but I now know to be a grass forager and another tractor approached.

'As we drew nearer they slowed and they were stationary as we passed, but the horses were upset and they wound each other up.

'My wife came past me and it was immediately apparent that shed lost her balance completely.

'Her horse was on the pavement near to an opening to a field. It was uneven and she was bucked out of the saddle.

'Her right leg got caught in the stirrup. Her foot didnt release and she was dragged down the road a little way.

'It was immediately apparent that she'd been seriously injured.'

Motorist Stephen Hill said that the drivers of the grass forager and the tractor that followed drove off after the horses passed, probably unaware of the tragedy that had unfolded behind them on May 26 last year.

Both tractor drivers contacted police after hearing about the tragic incident later that same day, the hearing heard.

Mr Hill, who went to Mrs Franciss aid, added: 'The tractor drivers were in no way to blame.'

He said that he found the stricken rider in a pool of blood and dialled 999 on the mobile phone of fellow motorist Kathryn Wroe, who had also witnessed the collision.

Two passing cyclists gave assistance but told paramedics arriving at the scene that they could not feel her pulse and she was not breathing.

The Yorkshire Air Ambulance was dispatched to Cortworth Lane but Mrs Francis died at the scene.

Pathologist Dr Arun Manoharan reported that, despite wearing a helmet, she had died due to fractures to her skull and neck.

The Rotherhams Assistant Coroner, Mr Mark Beresford, concluded that Mrs Francis had died as the result of an accident.

Mrs Francis left behind sons Alex and Joseph, daughter Charlotte and two grandsons, one of whom was born just months after her death.

A former chairman of the Wentworth Village Band, she was also a passionate leader of the Wentworth Scout Group for 20 years.

Speaking after Wednesdays inquest, Mr Francis, her husband of 35 years, said that he and his family were still devastated by the loss of his wife.

In a eulogy given at her funeral at Wentworth Church, he explained: 'I feel I have been and remain, a very fortunate man.

'Fortunate that I had Christine at the centre of my life for over 40 years, 35 years as my wife and almost from the moment we met as my best friend

'Fortunate that I was with her at the time of the accident and have no lingering doubts about the circumstances

'Fortunate, that I have the comfort of knowing that following the accident she was instantly at peace and fortunate that I know, that on that fateful morning, she was doing something she loved, with someone she loved, in a place that she loved and on a horse that she adored.'
