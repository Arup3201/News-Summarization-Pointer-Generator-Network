Two ex-British soldiers who travelled to Syria to fight against Islamic State (ISIS) have had panic alarms fitted to their homes upon their return for fear of reprisals from extremists.

Jamie Read and James Hughes revealed the heightened security around them since their return in their first television interview, in which they  described the battleground in the war-torn country as 'like World War One'.

Mr Read, 24, from Cumbria, had previously said his motivation for travelling to fight was the murder of aid volunteer Alan Henning.

He said he and Mr Hughes, 26, from Worcestershire, 'felt compelled' to take up arms.

'I could not justify sitting back in the UK and watching IS pretty much do what they like,' he told Sky News.

Upon their return they were detained at Heathrow Airport and questioned for six hours, although they were not arrested and were released before their homes were placed under monitoring by counter-terror police.

Mr Read, who had a brief stint in the Second Battalion, The Duke of Lancaster's regiment, said: 'The counter-terrorism police have got our houses red-flagged in the sense of if any calls come out from that area they will be straight to our house. We have got panic alarms fitted in both our houses now.'

Mr Hughes, who served three tours of Afghanistan with the Army, added: 'There's patrols purposely put out in case of said event would happen.'

On their arrest, Mr Read said they knew there was a risk but he felt their mission was a 'humanitarian effort' and the pair also again denied claims they were 'mercenaries', saying they had come back to 'a lot of debt'. 

In the pair's first TV interview, Mr Read (pictured, right and left) said there are fears that his or Mr Hughes may be attacked in the UK and their homes are being watched by the security services

The pair also revealed they had resolved to take their own lives if they felt they could be captured by the militants, who were battling Kurdish forces to take control of the Syrian border town of Kobani. 

'If at any one point we honestly, genuinely felt they were coming coming for us, 'it's definitely over', if we had rounds on us, if we had weapons on us then keep one for yourself,' Mr Read said.

'Nobody wants to get captured by IS, nobody wants to end up on YouTube getting their head cut off. Nobody wants that. As harsh as it sounds, it's probably the better way to go.' 

On the other side of the battle lines, official figures suggest more than 500 Britons have travelled to fight for ISIS in Syria and Iraq.

At the time the men went to fight, the Home Office warned against all travel to the country, saying anyone who did so was putting themselves in 'considerable danger'.

Taxi driver Mr Henning, 47, was killed by a masked militant known as Jihadi John in a video released online in October following a string of similarly publicised killings.

ISIS has also posted a series of videos online showing the separate murders of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, US aid worker Peter Kassig and British aid worker David Haines.

Footage appearing to show Mr Henning's murder appeared on the internet days after the UK joined US-led air strikes against the terrorists in Iraq.

A Home Office spokesman said: 'The UK advises against all travel to Syria and parts of Iraq. Anyone who does travel to these areas, even for humanitarian reasons, is putting themselves in considerable danger of harm. 

'The best way for the public to help is to donate to or otherwise support UK-registered charities that have ongoing relief operations.'
