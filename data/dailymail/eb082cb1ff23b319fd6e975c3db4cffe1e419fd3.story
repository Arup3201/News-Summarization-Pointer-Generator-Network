Van driver Richard Orlu admits he faces 'the biggest game of my life' when Dover Athletic host his home town club Crystal Palace.

Defender Orlu could line up against friend Jason Puncheon as Conference side Dover entertain Premier League Palace in Sunday's FA Cup third-round clash.

Orlu put his part-time delivery work on hold for the hectic Christmas schedule that has seen Dover stretch to 16 games without defeat.

The 26-year-old defender grew up a stone's throw from Selhurst Park in Thornton Heath, and conceded he cannot wait for Palace to arrive on the south coast.

'This is definitely the biggest game of my life,' Orlu said.

'I'm an Arsenal fan actually, even though Palace are my local team.

'I've got friends who are Palace fans and I knew a lot of people who went through their youth system growing up.

'It's the biggest club around where I come from, so if you're one of the best players where I'm from, you play for Palace.

'I was never amongst that to be honest, I never played for them.

'So it will be a bit weird to be on the same pitch as them.

'It hasn't really sunk in yet, and it probably won't until after the game.

'I know Jason Puncheon a little, he's very friendly; he's a really nice guy and I don't think anyone has a bad word to say about him.

'He's an excellent player as well, he's got great feet and he's a huge threat for them.'

Dover have already fended off two League Two clubs in Morecambe and Cheltenham to reach the FA Cup's third round.

The Crabble Athletic Ground outfit were paired with Tottenham away in the rehearsal for the third-round drawn, but are more excited to play host to Palace.

Dover could net as much as £250,000 from their cup exploits once television revenue is accounted, with chairman Jim Parmenter guiding the club away from the brink of administration on taking charge 10 years ago.

Orlu leads a cast of hard-working semi-professionals who hold down day jobs while training three evenings a week with Dover.

'We've got a far greater chance of winning it here,' he said.

'I'd rather have more chance of winning than to play at Selhurst Park.'

Dover assistant Mark Newson doubles as an academy coach at Palace, and embarked on an improbable Intertoto Cup campaign with Alan Pardew at Tottenham in 1995.

Pardew is expected to complete his move from Newcastle to the managerial hotseat at Palace in time to direct operations from the dugout on Sunday.

Newson and Pardew were drafted into the Spurs set-up on loan from lower leagues for that unlikely European sojourn, and will now link up again at Palace.

Newson admitted a Dover win this weekend may place his Selhurst Park position in jeopardy next week.

'I haven't seen Alan at Palace this week myself, but I'm just hoping that if we beat them on Sunday I'm still in a job on Monday!' Newson said.

'Alan's done a terrific job at Newcastle even though he's taken a lot of stick.

'I think he'll have more control and more say at Palace, which will be different from Newcastle.'

Pardew was at Palace's training ground on Friday for just under 12 hours as he started life at his new club
