A man who suffered a serious eye injury as a child has got a tattoo - on his eyeball.

William Watson, 58, underwent the extremely rare cosmetic procedure - which is definitely not for the squeamish - while he was awake. 

Mr Watson, from New York, experienced damage to his eye when he was hit in the face by a ball when he was a child, leaving his left iris looking permanently white and cloudy.

The cosmetic procedure does not improve the actual condition of the damaged eye but the injected ink allows the eye to look like a normal pupil

Its appearance drew unwanted attention and unwelcome stares from strangers, so Mr Watson, who works at Madison Square Garden, decided to get the unusual tattoo.

The cosmetic procedure does not improve the actual condition of the damaged eye but the injected ink allows the pupil to look normal.

The procedure was carried out by Dr Emil Chynn of Park Ave SafeSight and CJ Pento, a tattoo artist from the Red Legged Devils tattoo shop in Brooklyn, New York.

Speaking before the procedure, Mr Watson said: 'It will be a big change. I wont have the scar tissue no more and I'll be able to look people in the eye without people saying too much about it.'

'Also, taking pictures without a whiteness in my eye - I'll feel a lot better.'

Dr Chynn did the actual tattooing while Mr Pento mixed the colours and assisted him in his work.

To make sure the hour-long procedure was done accurately, the pair practised pupil tattooing manoeuvres beforehand on a grape.

Mr Watson was first given an anaesthetic and then injected with coloured ink, which was then set into place with a swab on the pupil.

 'I can't believe how much better I look on the outside and how much better I feel inside,' William Watson said

Afterwards, Mr Watson said: 'It felt like someone was rubbing it - that's about it. It went smoothly, no nothing whatsoever. It was nice.'

And amazingly, after a few weeks of healing, the pupils looked nearly identical.

Mr Watson said: 'I can't believe how much better I look on the outside and how much better I feel inside.

'Dr Chynn gave me a way to normality I didn't even know existed six months ago. I feel much more confidence in myself.'
