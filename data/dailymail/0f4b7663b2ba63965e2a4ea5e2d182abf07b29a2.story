Billionaire businessman James Stunt's £1million calvalcade of cars has been spotted for a second time this week, parked outside another prestigious art gallery in the capital.

The 28-year-old, who is married to Petra - the daughter of Formula One billionaire Bernie Ecclestone - was yesterday seen picking up an array of art work at Christie's Art Gallery in London's Old Brompton Road.

But it seems Mr Stunt's vast wealth and fortune does not make him exempt from the eagle eye of parking attendants.

A traffic warden patrolling the exclusive South Kensington streets close to the prestigious art house, was not intimidated by the five-strong cavalry of Rolls Royce, Range Rovers and a Lamborghini.

The conscientious warden did not hesitate in the face of the imposing brigade of cars and security staff, appearing to treat Mr Stunt as any other motorist on his patch.

He appeared to take down the fleet's details before a piece of paper resembling a parking ticket was placed on the front window of the Lamborghini super car, which is worth £350,000 and was driven away from the gallery by Mr Stunt himself.

Mr Stunt was accompanied by his team of security staff, as he appeared to be adding to his already extensive art collection.

Members of his team were spotted carrying paintings from the art gallery, loading them into the waiting fleet of super cars.

Just four days earlier, Mr Stunt was spotted in almost identical circumstances, as his convoy pulled up at the Daniel Hunt Fine Art Gallery on Sloane Street in neighbouring Chelsea.

Mr Stunt is well known for his art collection, and recently he attempted to purchase a self-portrait by Baroque painter Anthony Van Dyck for his Los Angeles home.

But the sale of the painting fell through when art campaigners mounted opposition to the work being shipped out of the UK.

The successful campaign raised more than £10million to save the portrait for the nation, and the work, which dates back to 1640, has been offered to the National Portrait Gallery after Mr Stunt agreed to withdraw.

Mr Stunt has been married to Petra, 25, since 2011 and the couple have a daughter, Lavinia. He has an estimated wealth of £5.5billion

Mr Stunt has been married to Petra, 25, since 2011 and the couple have a daughter, Lavinia. He has an estimated wealth of £5.5billion.

His father-in-law Bernie Ecclestone is currently on trial in Germany accused of bribery, which he denies.

The Formula One billionaire, reportedly said this week, that Mr Stunt's extravagant antics are way over the top.

The motor-racing tycoon said: 'When I saw James a few weeks ago, I told him quite upfront: "You are a flash b*****d."

'I said to him: "Why are you driving around in that bloody car?" He was proud to tell me it's the only one in the world, there isn't another one.

'It's beautiful, but I said: "What do you want this car for in London?" He said it's very comfortable. But I said: "For Christ's sake! Where are you going in it?" '

‘James has
 got another car following him with so-called bodyguards, but nobody’s 
going to kill him,’ 83-year-old Mr Ecclestone added.

‘I told him: “If any one wanted to kill you, which they don’t, those guys that are driving in that car ain’t going to help.”

‘I think he got this from America. Everyone who wants to be known there has to have a bodyguard.’
