Bruce Jenner may be to blame for the four-car crash that left one person dead and seven injured, according to sources who said that the pattern of damage on the car he rear-ended suggested that impact was the very first  in the sequence.

Former Olympian Jenner, 65, smashed his Cadillac Escalade into the back of the victim's white Lexus on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California, on Saturday.

According to previous reports, the Lexus had been in Jenner's path after coming to a halt when it hit a Prius travelling ahead. 

The Lexus was then pushed into the path of a Hummer coming the other way, leaving the vehicle a crumpled wreck and the sole occupant, 69-year-old Kim Howe, dead.

Bruce Jenner may have struck both the white Lexus and and a Prius in the horror crash on Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California, on Saturday, according to TMZ

Police sources told TMZ that an theory operating theory is that Jenner rear-ended the Lexus and when the Lexus cleared his lane, his car kept moving and crashed into the Prius

The Kardashian family patriarch, who escaped the crash unscathed, took a roadside sobriety test in front of officers in the wake of the collision, which he passed.

Investigators are now trying to determine the cause and circumstances surrounding the crash and plan to look at the cellphone records of all four drivers and check for any video evidence 

Now, sources have told TMZ that, rather than the chain reaction being caused by the victim's Lexus hitting the Prius in front of her, Jenner may have hit both cars.

They claimed that because the Lexus had been travelling in a straight line before being rear-ended by Jenner's Escalade, if the Lexus had first struck the Prius, there would have been the same amount of damage to the left and right sides of the front of the Lexus before he hit it - but pictures of the incident suggest there is not.

A representative for the Prius also driver told TMZ that there is an imprint of Jenner's license plate in the car. 

Law enforcement sources told the celebrity news site that one operating theory is that the Prius had been stopped behind cars and, as a traffic light turned green, vehicles began moving.

It was at this point, sources say, that Jenner rear-ended the Lexus and when the Lexus cleared his lane, his car kept moving and crashed into the Prius.

TMZ reported that police say when Jenner hit the Lexus, it veered left while his Escalade moved to the right.

The woman who died in the four-car crash was 69-year-old widow Kim Howe, a neighbour of the Kardashians

Detectives in Malibu have opened a vehicular homicide investigation. If any of the drivers in the crash are found criminally negligent, felony charges could be filed - which carry a sentence of up to six years in prison.

If it is determined that Jenner's Escalade struck both cars and authorities find he was following too closely, it would make prosecution for vehicular manslaughter more likely than if he was just part of the chain reaction.

Investigations will determine if Jenner, or any of the other three drivers involved in the collision, were texting or on their mobile phones at the time of the collision.

It is illegal to text while driving in California.

The star's representative has denied that he was texting behind the wheel. 

Breaking his silence on the crash the following day, Jenner said in a statement: 'My heartfelt and deepest sympathies go out to the family and loved ones, and to all of those who were involved or injured in this terrible accident.'

'It is a devastating tragedy, and I cannot pretend to imagine what this family is going through at this time. I am praying for them. I will continue to cooperate in every way possible.'

But three days after the crash, Jenner was seen talking on his phone while driving in Los Angeles.

The reality star had the device pressed to his ear while behind the wheel in Thousand Oaks, California.
