Roy Hodgson will award Wayne Rooney his 100th England cap against Slovenia next Saturday — but admits he fears the responsibility of being captain for club and country may eventually tell on the Manchester United striker.

Rooney is closing in on a range of historic landmarks — winning his 100th cap at 29 puts him well within sight of David Beckham’s record number of 115 England appearances as an outfield player and means he could ultimately surpass Peter Shilton’s all-time record of 125.

He is also closing in on Sir Bobby Charlton’s goal-scoring records for both England and Manchester United, with Rooney on 43 and 219 compared to Charlton’s 49 and 249.

The Euro 2014 qualifier against Slovenia at Wembley will be a celebration for Rooney but having been made captain of both England and Manchester United in recent months, Hodgson says he will need to ensure the burdens placed on him are not too great.

‘Since he has been made captain, I think he has taken a further step, both at Manchester United and with us,’ said Hodgson. ‘The big question is, of course, as one of the few seniors left in the team, absolutely guaranteed a place in the team and the same at Manchester United, I worry the sense of responsibility is going to weigh him down.

‘Myself and the coaching staff do all we can to make sure that will not happen with us, but it is all very well telling someone to leave your problems behind and don’t worry about them, to get on with your life; it is easy to say, but very hard to do sometimes.

The cap will make Rooney become the youngest player to reach 100 caps at the age of 29

‘At the moment I think he’s coping with it well but we’ll have to keep an eye on the situation, as will Louis (van Gaal), to make sure it doesn’t weigh him down. 

But until that time comes we’ve just got to get on with it and be glad that he’s doing the job that we as coaching staff want him to do. And ensure that the other players know their job so well that they’re not relying on him to get them out of trouble.

‘He’s really taken on this job as captain with enormous seriousness. He’s studied and talked a lot with Steven Gerrard, because Steven was in a similar position really: he hadn’t had a lot captaincy before I decided to make him captain, so he had a lot of chats with him about what’s needed.’
