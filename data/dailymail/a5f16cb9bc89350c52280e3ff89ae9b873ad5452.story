Magic Johnson's son underwent the gastric sleeve surgery he announced he wanted on Saturday's #RichKids of Beverly Hills season finale back in August, E! News reports.

EJ Johnson, 22-year-old NYU student and self-appointed 'diva,' reportedly underwent the surgery shortly after filming the last episode of season two of the show.  

'A lot of people think it's the easy way out, but it's not. It's a step in the right direction, just a big push,' he said on the final episode of the season.

Many celebrities struggling to lose weight, such as Rosie O'Donnell, have opted for gastric sleeve surgery.

The Examiner reports that O'Donnell went under the knife in 2013 after numerous health scares and a heart attack caused her to worry about her weight.

During the operation, about 80% of the stomach is removed, shrinking what's left of the organ to a tube the size of a banana.

Johnson announced he was planning on getting the surgery on the season two finale of #RichKids of Beverly Hills.

The show stars the offspring of several wealthy families in Beverly Hills. 

Joan Rivers had EJ Johnson as a guest on Fashion Police last year and asked him about his relationship with his father, the legendary Lakers point guard who won five national championships with the team.

'We go shopping together all the time. He helps me pick out clothes and bags and stuff like that,' EJ Johnson said.

The New York Post reports that Johnson came out as gay to his family when he was 17, though TMZ publicly outed him later. 

'I was very grateful that they supported me 100 percent and had my back. It was really powerful,' the younger Johnson said.
