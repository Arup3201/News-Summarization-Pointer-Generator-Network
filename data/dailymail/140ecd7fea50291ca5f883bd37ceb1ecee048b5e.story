A teenager who shed almost six stone after seeing ‘horrendous’ prom photos of herself has been crowned Young Slimmer of the Year.

The weightloss has given Paige Stoodley, 18, from Telford, the confidence to go to university to train to be a nurse.

She has also been crowned Slimming World Young Slimmer of the Year 2013 after going from 16st 11lb to a svelte 11st, dropping five dress sizes.

Weightloss Queen: Paige Stoodley is Slimming World Young Slimmer of the Year after losing 6 stone when she saw her prom dress pictures. Paige is now starting Keele University feeling more confident than ever

The 5ft 6in teenager says she had struggled with her weight for years and admitted she used to be a comfort eater.

She said: 'For as long as I remember I've always been bigger than my friends. I was a very emotional eater, I used food as a reward for doing well or as a comforter if I’d had a bad day.'

Paige unsuccessfully tried losing dieting for years but couldn't stick to cutting out her favourite calorific foods.

However, weighing in at 17st and struggling to shop for her prom dress, Paige’s grandmother persuaded her to go to a Slimming World class with her in April 2012.

She said: 'At the age of 17 I was almost 17st and I knew something had to change.

'Shopping for my prom dress was probably one of the worst experiences I've ever had. I was so excited and had all these ideas in my head of how I wanted to look, but the reality was that every dress I liked either didn't fit or looked horrendous.

'I felt so embarrassed that I ended up just wanting to go home. I did find a dress in the end but I didnt like any of the photos of me in it.'

Paige found the Slimming World system of eating a balanced diet, rather than a restricted one, was easier for her to stick to and the pounds soon started to fall off.

She said: 'Being able to eat pasta and potatoes without weighing and measuring them out seemed too good to be true, and I loved being able to have a treat like a bar of chocolate or a bag of crisps when I fancied one as well.

The turning point: It was this photograph, left, that spurred Paige to lose weight and she's since dropped from a dress size 22 to 12

'It’s about learning how to balance your diet, not restricting yourself.'

Attending the group each week, Paige learned about healthy eating. She swapped her unhealthy breakfast of pasties and sausage rolls for cereal with semi-skimmed milk topped with chopped banana or berries.

She also started cooking her favourite meals - spaghetti bolognese and homemade beef burgers with potato wedges and salad - for herself and her parents, instead of having takeaways.

The cooking skills she has picked up will serve her well when she starts her first term at Keele University later this month.

She explained: 'What I liked is that the plan put me in control. I was given all the information, support and tools I needed but the choice - about what weight I wanted to be or what I wanted to eat - and the responsibility was mine.

'It makes me feel so proud of what I’ve achieved, more so than if I’d have just been doing as I was told or following some strict regime for a short period of time.

'I know I’ll have to live on a fairly tight budget at university but I think I’ve learned a lot about value for money and how to get healthy, tasty food without spending too much - I love big pasta dishes and jacket potatoes.

Control: She says the diet plan put her in control and she can still eat some treats in moderation

'I still manage to eat out with my friends and go on nights out too so I’m not worried about socialising either.'

Since starting at Slimming World, Paige, who also walks regularly now instead of taking the bus, has dropped from a dress size 22 to a 12.

It was after she started losing weight that she decided to apply to study the demanding course of mental health nursing at university, saying: 'I know nursing can be quite physical and you’re on your feet a lot so I was worried I wouldn’t have been able to cope with that side of things when I was bigger.

'I’m sure that my weight loss helped me get accepted onto my course too. I think I was able to get across my enthusiasm and passion for nursing because I feel better about myself. I feel like I make a better first impression, so I could focus on the interview itself.'

New life: Now she has lost weight, she has the confidence to head to university to study mental health nursing

'I feel better about myself. I feel like I make a better first impression, so I could focus on the interview itself' said Paige of gaining a place on the course
