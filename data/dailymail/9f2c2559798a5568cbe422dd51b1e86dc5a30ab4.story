First class passengers are used to being spoiled with the best seats, food and entertainment.

But now first class passengers on Qantas will be escape to escape their flight entirely - by donning a virtual reality headset.

The first has partnered with Samsung to offer first class passengers a Gear VR headset instead of the normal in flight entertainment system.

Passengers will be able to see a selection of films about destinations and resorts the airline flies to, along with specially developed films and Hollywood blockbusters

As part of the trial, a number of Samsung Gear VR headsets will be made available to customers in Sydney and Melbourne International First Lounges as well as in the First Class cabins on select A380 services. 

'Whether the user wants a virtual tour of our new Los Angeles First Lounge or experience an A380 landing from the tarmac, this technology gives us a completely new way to connect with our customers,' said Olivia Wirth of Qantas.

'From an inflight entertainment perspective, it's an industry first. 

'Qantas is committed to being at the forefront of innovation to give our passengers the very best and latest in-flight experiences, like accessing the virtual worlds of their favourite Hollywood blockbusters from the comfort of their seat 40,000 feet above the ground.

'It's also a fantastic tool to feature our network's destinations, inspiring travel and promoting tourism.'

The trial will run for three months to assess customer feedback on how this kind of VR offering might add to their overall travel experience on long-haul flights.

Qantas Group Executive, Brand, Marketing & Corporate Affairs Olivia Wirth said the technology will open up a new world of lounge and inflight entertainment for customers, as well as give Qantas a powerful way to preview destinations and experiences.

Passengers will be able to see a selection of films about destinations and resorts the airline flies to.

They will also be able to watch VR movies and more traditional Hollywood blockbusters on the headset in a'virtual cinema'.

Qantas is also working closely with production company Jaunt to develop and produce the live-action content including destination footage.

Samsung's Arno Lenior, said the deal will allow more people to try VR.

'Samsung is immensely proud to be working with Qantas to deliver Samsung Gear VR entertainment technology through the airline's first class services, both in the air and on the ground.

'We believe Samsung Gear VR, one of the latest innovations from Samsung, will open new worlds for Qantas customers who experience the technology for themselves,' Mr Lenior said.

Tourism NT is the first tourism group to partner with Qantas on the content creation, with a special 3D experience from Kakadu National Park.

The Northern Territory's Chief Minister and Minister for Tourism, Adam Giles, said: 'This innovation literally adds a new dimension to how visitors experience Kakadu. 

'Tourism NT is delighted to pilot this new technology as part of its suite of marketing projects utilising new, industry leading technology, and what better way to demonstrate the impact this VR technology can have than by showcasing Kakadu, one of the world's most iconic 'must do' tourism destinations.'

The Samsung VR headsets will be featured in the First Class Lounge in Sydney and Melbourne from mid-February and on select A380 flights between Australia and Los Angeles in the First Class cabin from mid-March.
