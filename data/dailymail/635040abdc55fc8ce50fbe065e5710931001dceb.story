A former NYPD officer who was sentenced to three years’ probation last week for tagging his nickname to an overpass in Queens says the latest graffiti isn’t his, though his checkered past says otherwise.

Steven Weinberg, a 44-year-old retired officer, spent much of the 1980s vandalising walls and subway cars with his art.

But Weinberg, who suffers from nerve damage from an injury sustained on the job over a decade ago, uses a cane to get around and says the latest bout of graffiti – which is in the middle of a highway overpass - isn’t his.

the NYPD due to a leg injury in 2001, was put on three years probation

Problem picture: This tag appeared in 2009, and has since been the heart of the City's case against Steven Weinberg, saying it shows that he is still active

Weinberg was convicted last week of putting his tag, Neo, along a Queens overpass in Bayside in 2009, but he insists it was a copycat.

‘I never admitted to doing this,’ he told the New York Post. ‘I never denied I used to do it, but I didn’t do this graffiti on the highway.’

The former officer, now married with a wife and young daughter, told the New York Daily News at his hearing last week that he stopped doing graffiti after he joined the force in 1995.

The judge, however, didn’t believe his plea. ‘I know that you’re in chronic pain,’ Supreme Court Justice Salvatore Modica said.

‘I understand what you’re going through. It does not excuse the criminal behaviour.’

All over the place: Neo's tags have been spotted on walls, trains, and trucks

According to the News, prosecutors said Weinberg bragged about the tagging on a MySpace page.

Back in the 1980s, when the city was full of graffiti artists and squeegee men, crime ran rampant on the streets of New York.

Weinberg said that at the time, sloppy security allowed he and other artists to roam the streets and subways ‘like it was a playground at Mickey D’s.’

Regardless, he said he enjoyed the thrill, as well as the artistic aspects, not the drug culture that is often associated with graffiti.

Around the corner: Neo started tagging in his neighbourhood of Queens

He receives an annual disability pension of $38,000 a year. Weinberg retired in 2001 after sustaining serious nerve damage to his leg.

He was forced to pay a $700 fine at his sentencing last week.

The judge also ordered him to participate in a programme in Brooklyn which teaches art history and how to use graffiti productively.

The programme is called ‘Paint Straight.’

He told the Post: ‘I believe in rehabilitation. I think you cause more problems in society when you give people convictions on something like this, when you could have them contribute to society instead.’
