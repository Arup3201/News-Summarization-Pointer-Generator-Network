Ally McCoist admits he’d rather avoid Celtic if Ronny Deila’s side join Rangers in the League Cup semi-finals.

In the first game of the Mike Ashley era, the Ibrox side claimed their place in the last four of the competition with a one-goal victory over Premiership St Johnstone courtesy of Lewis Macleod’s header four minutes from time.

Provided Celtic see off Partick Thistle on Wednesday night, there’s a one in three chance of a first Old Firm game in almost three years.

But McCoist admitted he’d rather be paired with any side other than their old rivals.

‘When you get to the semis, you can’t really pick and choose,’ McCoist said.

‘We all know who would be favourites to pick up the domestic trophies before the season starts.

‘I don’t think that would change, so in that respect I would probably take anyone else other than Celtic.

‘I don’t think it is rocket science to work out it would maybe give you a better chance of reaching the final, although it wouldn’t guarantee it.

‘It would be a very, very tough game (against Celtic). Stating the obvious, we would very much be the underdogs. But underdogs can sometimes win.’

Speaking after his manager, however, match-winner Macleod said he’d relish the prospect of facing Celtic in three months’ time if fate decreed it.

‘It goes without saying that it would be one of the most hyped up games for a wee while,’ said the 20-year-old.

‘But we will see how the draw goes at the weekend and we will look forward to the semi-final no matter who we play against.’

Just 13,023 turned up at Ibrox for the first game since it was confirmed that Newcastle owner Ashley’s £2million loan would give him control over the boardroom.

Ashley’s right-hand man Derek Llambias — who has initially been employed as a consultant — watched proceedings from the main stand amid an air of expectation that significant change is in the air.

It was later confirmed that communications director Paul Tyrell, who was brought in by former chief executive Graham Wallace, is leaving the club with immediate effect.

Asked if he believed he’d be reporting directly to Llambias, McCoist replied: ‘I don’t know. I haven’t been told anything and I haven’t met anyone yet. I don’ t have any doubt that time will come. But right now it’s about getting the boys brushed down and ready for another tough tie on Saturday (against Dumbarton in the Scottish Cup).

‘I spoke to the chairman (David Somers) and Sandy (Easdale) on Monday and as I see it just now, I’ll have discussions with anyone - board members or shareholders. Anyone who wants to talk, I’ll talk.’

Asked if he’d spoken with Llambias yet, McCoist said: ‘I haven’t, no. I obviously was preparing totally for the game Saturday but I’m looking forward to meeting him.

‘We are in tomorrow morning and the boys will do their cool down. I am available to meet anyone at any time but there are no plans as such.’

McCoist admitted he was surprised at the low attendance. ‘It’s not the norm, I accept that,’ he said.

‘But as I said before the game, whether there are 500 or 50,000 in the ground, the job is still the same and you have to be professional in the manner you go about your job. I felt we did that tonight. It was a tough, stubborn first half but we lifted it in the second half and deserved to go through.’

McCoist also heaped praise on Macleod for his part in extending his side’s run to five straight wins.

‘He’s a top player,’ he added. ‘I have to say, it was a very important goal but equally the delivery in was from another young lad (Fraser Aird) who has been doing really well for us last year and this year so it was very positive that the two young lads linked up to get us into the semi-final.

‘We asked Lewis at the start of the season to contribute a bit more in terms of his assists and his finishing and he’s certainly doing that.

‘I thought particularly in the first half it was pretty tough and stubborn. In the second half, I thought we were a lot better, the better team, and deserved to win the game. It was a goal worthy of winning any game.’

McCoist revealed that goalkeeper Steve Simonsen required hospital treatment after colliding with the post while saving Brian Graham’s second-half header.

‘I am concerned because he’s off to hospital for a wee check-up,’ he went on. ‘The doc said it’s hopefully more precautionary than anything else but wouldn’t be qualified to give you a comment on it until he’s been looked at in the hospital. Fingers crossed he will be all right.

‘I haven’t seen it but the boys told me that straight away that was pretty clear. You can always tell by the players’ reaction when another player goes down injured, normally the severity of it, and our lads were wanting the doc on and there was a substitution straight away so it was worrying — very worrying.’
