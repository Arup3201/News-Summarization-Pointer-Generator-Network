A Missouri bar owner hit with a cease and desist order from Starbucks responded sarcastically and even proposed a mock settlement.

The sarcasm-filled letter was sent from Exit 6 Pub and Brewery owner Jeff Briton to lawyers for the coffee giant demanding he change the name of one of his in-house brews from ‘Frappicino’ so it was not confused with a the chain's popular ‘Frappucino' drink.

Mr Britton referred to the beer as ‘F Word’ throughout the letter, mockingly apologized for ‘any damage’ caused and cut a check for the $6 in profit earned from the three beers sold under the similar name.

The row began when Starbucks lawyers became aware of the ‘F Word’ beer after a handful of customers checked un on beer social network Untappd saying they drank it – they soon sent a letter to Mr Britton, which he posted to his bar's Facebook page.

The letter was first spotted by the website Grubstreet.

The letter from the attorneys accused Mr Britton of trying to ‘cause confusion, mistake or deception’ among people who may think he is affiliated with Starbucks – his response put those fears to rest after first apologizing for his poor spelling.

The name of his beer was spelled 'Frappicino,' Starbucks spells their frozen coffee drink as 'Frappucino.'

‘We never thought that our beer drinking customers would have thought that the alcoholic beverage coming out of the tap would have actually been coffee from one of the many, many, many stores located a few blocks away,’ the bar owner wrote.

Settlement proposal: A check for the $6 profit he made from selling the three beers

‘I guess that with there being a Starbucks on every corner of every block in every city that some people may think they could get a Starbucks at a local bar,’ he continued. ‘That was our mistake.

‘We are bad people. We feel shame… we also promise to stop production of our ‘Starbuck-McDonald’s-Coca Cola-Marlboro-Honey Lager’ for fear of further repercussions,’ Mr Britton sarcastically wrote.

He also included a $6 check that was the sum total of profits received from the sale of the three beers in question, because ‘us small business owners need to stick together.’
