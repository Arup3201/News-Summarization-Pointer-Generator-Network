British Extreme Enduro racer Ben Hemingway shows us just how tough going his day job can be with a brilliant point-of-view video, filmed via a GoPro camera on his helmet, as he zips through the steep and narrow staircases of Porto.

Leeds-based Hemingway shares his experience during a race against German Andreas Lettenbichler during the city portion of the Extreme XL de Lagares race in Portugal.

Hemingway commentates the action from start to finish, his voice getting increasingly breathy as the race nears its frenetic conclusion. 'Oh it’s hard work is this,' he says.

Impressive reflexes, agility and a full array of riding techniques are required to manoeuvre a host of challenging corners during the three-minute video.

Wooden logs at the start of the video appear tricky but are just the tip of the iceberg as Hemingway moves quickly through the course alongside his rival Lettenbichler.

Hemingway does his utmost to take the lead in the race, however, Lettenbichler manages to skip in front of him after they negotiate the logs and the track narrows. 

Hemingway is on the back foot from that moment but he position in the contest doesn't diminish the thrill for viewers as he speeds down long, slender stone staircases lined with fans in the city centre. 

As the two motorcyclists ride side-by-side in the opening stages the pair come together. 'We've clashed, he's nicked me,' Hemingway says as the bikes collide and his opponent brushes by.

More logs awaited the racers at the end of the race, this time in piles increase the degree of difficulty

'That was quite hard work,' Hemingway says as he finishes seconds behind Lettenbichler

'It’s all good but I can follow him, it’s quite slippy in here,' Hemingway reassures his future listeners. 

As if tight spaces, sliding stone surfaces and hundreds of people weren't enough obstacles, Hemingway almost collects a photographer at the one minute and 13 seconds mark.  

Hemingway successfully navigates hundreds of steep steps, a rickety ramp over water and large log piles at the end of the race, not getting flustered at any point. But the honours went to Lettenbichler.

'And we’re finished,' Hemingway says before turning off his bike having safely negotiated another tough course. 'I don’t know how the commentary was [but] that was quite hard work.'
