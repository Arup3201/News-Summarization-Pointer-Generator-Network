Malaysia Airlines rerouted a flight to Kuala Lumpur over Syria after airspace above Ukraine was closed after the downing of MH17.

Swedish flight tracking service Flightradar24 AB posted a flight map on its Twitter account showing the change in the route of Malaysian Airlines flight MH4, which flies to London.

Flight tracking data showed this flight had previously crossed over eastern Ukraine.

Rerouted: The map shows flight MH4 flying over Syrian airspace on Sunday

Syria is in the middle of a civil war in which 170,000 people have died since 2011.

The controversial move comes after Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was shot down Thursday by a ground-to-air missile in eastern Ukraine. All 298 passengers and crew on board the flight were killed.

Since then, airlines have been told to avoid the airspace above where the Ukrainian military has been fighting Russian-backed rebels.

Fredrik Lindahl, chief executive officer of Flightradar24 AB, said it was relatively unusual for transcontinental flights to cross Syria.

‘With Iraq you always see aircraft flying there. There is no other way to access parts of the Middle East than to use the Iraq corridor,’ he said.

‘But you don't see Syria so often. We saw no other trans-continental flight that went through Syrian airspace yesterday.’

Some 
regional traffic uses Syrian airspace including a Middle East Airlines 
flight bound for Beirut on Monday, according to the Flightradar24 
website.

Aviation experts said governments must take the lead in deciding just where it is safe for airlines to fly.

Airlines have flown, safely, over war zones for many years but the tragic incident involving flight MH17 must lead to a re-assessment of the route decision process, the experts said.

Tony Tyler, director-general and chief executive of the International Air Transport Association (Iata) said: ‘Governments will need to take the lead in reviewing how airspace risk assessments are made.

‘And the industry will do all that it can to support governments, through ICAO (the International Civil Aviation Organisation), in the difficult work that lies ahead.’

Norman Shanks, visiting professor in aviation security at Coventry University, said: ‘At the moment the approval process leaves it very much up to the airlines to make the final decision on which routes they fly.

‘The security organisations within governments have all the risk information for areas of conflict.

‘If there is a chance that those fighting in a war zone have sophisticated, long-range weaponry then it should be up to the security organisations to say that that area should be completely avoided by airlines.’

Prof Shanks continued: ‘I think it would be very difficult to have a flying ban put over all areas of conflict. Airlines have been passing over war zones for some time.

‘Planes flying at high, cruising altitudes are just not in danger from most land-based weaponry. But if there is information that aircraft could be at risk then it is essential that information is passed on to aviation authorities, including air traffic control organisations.’

Malaysia Airlines said MH4's flight plan was in accordance with the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) approved routes.

‘As per the notice to airmen (NOTAM) issued by the Syrian Civil Aviation Authority, the Syrian airspace was not subject to restrictions,’ Malaysia Airlines said in a statement. 

‘At all times, MH4 was in airspace approved by ICAO.’

ICAO, which said last week it had no operational role and did not have the authority to open or close routes, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

Kenneth Quinn, a former chief counsel at the US Federal Aviation Administration and secretary of the US-based Flight Safety Foundation, questioned the wisdom of flying ‘over hotly contested territory’ but said he was not aware of a credible threat against airliners flying in Syrian airspace.

Tim Clark, president of Emirates Airlines, one of the world's largest airlines, said it was difficult to avoid flying over conflict zones on main routes between East and West.

Airlines assume that when a flight plan is accepted in controlled airspace, it is safe to fly on that particular route, Clark said.

There may have to be changes in the way the industry assesses such risks in light of the MH17 disaster, he added.

Hundreds of flights routinely crossed over Ukraine before Thursday's incident, and it is not unusual for international airlines to fly over war zones such as Afghanistan.

John Saba, a lecturer at McGill University's Integrated Aviation Management Programme in Montreal, said he did not think the Syrian government would fire missiles at airliners.

‘The question is: who has access to these (missiles) and what is the range?’ he said.

The US Federal Aviation Administration, whose regulations are among the world's strictest, ‘strongly discourages’ US operators from flying to, from or over Syria, according to a May 2013 notice on its website.
