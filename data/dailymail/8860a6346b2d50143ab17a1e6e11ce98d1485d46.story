A murdered teenager thought she had escaped the clutches of her abductor and sent a text saying 'I nearly got kidnapped OMFG' before she was beaten to death, a court has heard.

April Millsap, whose body was discovered on a walking trail in Armada, Michigan, sent the message just moments before she was ambushed by motorcyclist James D. VanCallis, according to police.

Yesterday VanCallis appeared at an arraignment hearing in Romeo, Michigan, accused of her murder.

During proceedings on Wednesday, Armada Police Chief Howard Smith spoke of April's final movements.

According to the Detroit Free Press, he said the teenager had been walking on the trail with her dog when she was seen talking to a man on a motorcycle, who a witness identified as VanCallis.
