Former Tottenham defender Ryan Nelsen has been fired as coach of Toronto FC after their 3-0 defeat to the New England Revolution on Saturday.

Nelsen, who lured the likes of Jermain Defoe to Major League Soccer, departs with his team still in contention to make the play-offs.

But it seems critical comments about Toronto general manager Tim Bezbatchenko after Saturday's defeat may have contributed to his departure. 

Sacked: Ryan Nelsen has been fired from his first managerial job at Toronto FC 

1 - D.C United (46 pts)

2 - Sporting Kansas City (42)

3 - New England Revolution (33)

4 - Torono FC (33)

5 - Columbus Crew (33)

6 - New York Red Bulls (31)

7 - Philadelphia Union (30)

8 - Chicago Fire (29)

9 - Houston Dynamo (28)

10 - Montreal Impact (20)

Nelsen was unhappy with comments Bezbatchenko had made telling the team to 'take it up a notch', claiming his players were being put under undue pressure, but it was the general manager who had the final word in this fight.

'Those comments (Nelsen made) were excuses, and we are not in the excuse business,' Bezbatchenko said in announcing Nelsen's departure.

Greg Vanney, a former United States international who was serving as the club's assistant GM, will take over, the club said.

Toronto invested heavily in their squad ahead of this season, with Defoe brought in along with United States international Michael Bradley, and sit fourth in the Eastern Conference.
