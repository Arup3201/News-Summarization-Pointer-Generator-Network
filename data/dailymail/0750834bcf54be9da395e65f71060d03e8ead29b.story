Survivalist Jimmy Lee Dykes set
his plan to ambush a Midland City school bus in motion by telling the driver
that he was 'going to give him a gift', it was revealed today.

The detail has emerged as the
hostage situation in Alabama continues into its fifth day.

According tot he children on the bus, the day before Dykes, 65, acted,
he told driver, Charles Poland, that he was going to give him some broccoli he had
grown on his land.

His intention was to ensure that
his approach caused no alarm when he boarded the vehicle on Tuesday afternoon
armed with a gun.

Five days: Jimmy Lee Dykes, left, has been holding five-year-old Ethan in his underground bunker near his home just outside Midland City, right, for five days

Negotiations: Alabama State Troopers and FBI agents huddled around a warming tower today. Their talks are still ongoing with Jimmy Lee Dykes near Midland City, Alabama

School bus: Earlier this week law enforcement officials removed the bus that Charles Poland Jr was driving when he was fatally shot

He shot Poland dead before taking a five-year-old boy named 'Ethan' 
hostage. The child is still being held captive by Dykes in his 
underground bunker.

A brother and sister, who escaped the school bus revealed Dykes' plan to fool Poland when they told reporters what happened on the bus today.

Terrica
Singletary, 14, and her brother 12-year-old Tristian were among the 
children who escaped the clutches of the retired Alabama trucker.

They said they saw Dykes hand the driver what looked like broccoli and a note.

'I look up and he's talking about 
threatening to kill us all or something,' Terrica told ABC's Good 
Morning America. 'He's like, 'I'll kill all y'all, I'll kill y'all, I 
just want two kids.'

Dykes demanded two children and when Poland refused Dykes pulled a gun and shot him dead.

'The bus driver kept saying, 'Just 
please get off the bus,' and [Dykes] said, 'Ah alright, I'll get off the
bus,'' said Terrica Singletary, 'He just tried to back up and reverse 
and [Dykes] pulled out the gun and he just shot him, and he just took 
Ethan.'

Police
today said they have an 'open line of communication' with Dykes and 
they were grateful he was taking care of the little boy at the bunker 
near his home in Midland City, Alabama.

Coloring books, medication and toys 
have been passed on Ethan according to Dale County Sheriff Wally Olson.

He also said Dykes had told them he has blankets and heating in his 6 by 8 feet survivalist lair where he is 
holding the child.

Stand-off: Police are communicating with Dykes through a pipe into his bunker

Gathered: The world's media have surrounded the scene of the shooting and hostage taking in Alabama and waited for news from state trooper Kevin Clark, center, today

Mission: Law enforcement officials continue to work the scene of the hostage crisis to try and encourage Dykes to release Ethan peacefully

Community hopes: A sign of support was put up and flags flew at half staff in Newton, near Midland City, Alabama this week. Vigils have also been held

Poland has been remembered as a hero for doing what he could to protect the 21 children on his bus.

Yesterday Olson refused to say 
whether Dykes has made any demands but did say he had allowed them to 
pass on items via a ventilation pipe which would make the child more 
comfortable.

'I want to thank him for taking care of our boy,' Olson said. 'That's very important.'

MailOnline exclusively revealed yesterday that the killer wants to exchange the child for a reporter so he can tell his story.

Dykes made the extraordinary offer on the first 
day of what has now turned into a siege situation.

Tuesday: Jimmy Lee Dykes boards an Alabama school bus demanding two children. Bus driver refuses and is shot dead. A 5-year-old boy named only as Ethan is taken hostage by Dykes

Wednesday:  Charles Albert Poland Jr is identified as the driver of the school bus. Ethan is held overnight as the FBI Hostage Team, emergency services attempt to negotiate the boy's release

Thursday: Experts continue talking to Dykes through a pipe - the only way to contact the bunker. Local community holds candlelit vigils praying for the standoff to end peacefully

Friday: Young Ethan is said to be crying for his parents. MailOnline reports that Dykes has demanded reporter in exchange for the boy as he wants to air his views

Saturday: Dykes allows toys and medication to be passed on via a ventilation pipe

A source with the
local sheriff's office has revealed that a CID Lieutenant spoke with 
Dykes for the first four hours, communicating 
via a pipe sticking out from the ground – the only surface sign of the 
bunker’s location.

In those
first crucial hours, Vietnam veteran Dykes attempted to strike his 
bargain – the boy in return for a reporter to tell his story of ‘how the
government had screwed him.’

According to the source, the bunker lies beneath what appears to be landscaped garden. 

There is a coi carp pond and a winding path before the ground rises to conceal two old freight containers buried beneath.

The door is believed to be booby trapped.

He
said: ‘You would think it was just landscaped yard. It’s not that 
unusual to have bunkers here – he told his neighbor he was making a 
tornado bunker.

‘A lot of folks around here have 
that. They can’t afford the pre-made plastic ones you sink into the 
ground so they buy old freight containers for $2000 and dig a hole.’

The FBI had considered sinking a wire
into the pipe to give them ‘eyes and ears’ in the bunker where Dykes 
has access to TV and a monitor linked to a camera via which he can 
monitor activity in his yard.

He said: ‘They decided to X-Ray the site first and they found it was wired with explosives.

‘The neighbors think he has pipe bombs in there too.’

Hostage negotiators are now communicating with Dykes via a ‘throw phone.'

Residents of Midland City have been holding a nightly candlelight vigil in the hope the standoff ends without further bloodshed.

'We're doing any little thing that helps show support for 
him,' 15-year-old Taylor Edwards said at one such event last night.

State Rep. Mike Ball of Huntsville, who spent 15 years as a 
hostage negotiator with the Alabama Bureau of Investigation, said today that 
the key for authorities is to patiently build a relationship with Dykes.

'They want to build a relationship with him and calm down 
the feeling of hopelessness he has,' he said. 'Any day that goes by with the 
child alive is a victory. If you string enough of those days together, he will 
come out.'

State Rep. Steve Clouse, who represents the Midland City 
area, said he visited the boy's mother and she is 'hanging on by a thread.' 
Clouse said the mother told him that the boy has Asperger's syndrome as well as 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.

Dr. Nadine Kaslow, a family therapist and psychiatry 
professor at Emory University in Atlanta, said the boy's emotional troubles 
might make things even more difficult for him.

'They have less way to make sense of things,' she said of 
children with Asperger's and ADHD.

Neighbors said Dykes was easily angered and once beat a dog 
to death with a lead pipe, threatened to shoot children for setting foot on his 
property and patrolled his yard at night with a flashlight and a firearm.

Discussions: The bunker where Dykes is hiding out with his 5-year-old hostage lies beneath what appears to be landscaped garden. The FBI are leading negotiations
