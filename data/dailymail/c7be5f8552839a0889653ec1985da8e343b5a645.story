In an incident guaranteed to make every man cringe, an Oklahoma resident woke up early Thursday to discover his girlfriend trying to bite off his penis after a lovers' quarrel.

The victim’s girlfriend, Amber Ellis, 31, of Tulsa, was arrested on charges of maiming and assault with a dangerous weapon in connection to the near-dismemberment.

Her unfortunate boyfriend, who has not been named, was rushed to a hospital were doctors were able to stitch up his mauled genitals.

Woman scorned: Amber Ellis, 31, did not take it well when her boyfriend told her she had become needy, so she reportedly responded by attempting to bite off his manhood as he slept 

According to a police report cited by the local station KJRH, the man said he and Ms Ellis were out drinking Wednesday night, and on the way home they got into an argument 'about how needy she had become.'

The couple continued trading verbal jabs upon returning to their apartment in the 7600 block of East 49th Street in Tulsa, until finally the 31-year-old woman stormed off to the bedroom and shut the door behind her.

Her boyfriend, who was described in the report as an amputee, according to Tulsa World, dozed off on the couch in the living room.

In the early hours of Thursday morning, the man was awakened by the sensation of teeth chomping on his privates.  

The man was able to fight Ellis off, but the scorned girlfriend, who stands at 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 120lbs, allegedly slammed him in the head with a laptop computer.

The injured boyfriend was taken to St John's Medical Center, where he received four or five stitches to the base of his manhood.

The near-dismemberment took place at the couple's home in the 7600 block of East 49th Street in Tulsa Oklahoma, early Thursday morning after the duo returned from a night out drinking 

He was also treated for bruises to his head, face, neck, fingers and knee.

At around 2.30pm, Amber Ellis was arrested and booked into the Tulsa County Jail on $25,000 surety bond.

This was not Ms Elllis' first run-in with the law: she landed in jail in late August on a domestic abuse charge.
