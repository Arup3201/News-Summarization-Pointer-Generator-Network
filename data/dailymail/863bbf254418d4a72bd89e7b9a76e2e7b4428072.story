The Harvard Business School professor who blasted a family-run Chinese restaurant for overcharging him $4 has previously attacked a sushi place in a dispute over a Groupon.

Associate professor Benjamin Edelman complained to the owners the of Sichuan Garden in Brookline, Boston, after he was charged $1 more on each of the four items he ordered for takeout recently.

But it wasn't the first unsatisfactory encounter that caused him to vent his frustrations via email. 

After the Osushi restaurant in the city's Back Bay refused to apply his Groupon coupon toward their prix fixe menu in 2010, he threatened to take his complaint to the city's licensing board.

Ben Edelman, an associate professor of business administration at Harvard,apologized after his threatening email exchange with a Chinese restaurant made headlines, but it wasn't his first 

In the email, published by Boston.com, he claimed he would fight to strip the establishment of its alcohol license 'if it does not honor its contractual commitments'. 

He wrote: 'I call on you to honor my three Osushi Groupon vouchers.

'I also call on you to extend their validity for six weeks to reflect the day imposed by our resolution of this dispute.

'If I don't hear from you within the next 15 days, or if we can't resolve this matter privately, I will forward my complaint to the City of Boston Licensing Board, writing in opposition to your Common Victualler License and Alcoholic Beverages License.

Mr Edelman sent threatening emails to the management of Osushi restaurant, pictured, after staff refused to apply his Groupon to the prix fixe menu in 2010

'I will argue that the City of Boston ought not renew such license to a restaurant that does not honor its contractual commitments.' 

But instead of apologizing to the stubborn customer, like Sichuan Garden did recently, Mr Edelman was banned from returning to the sushi restaurant.

Osushi restaurant's management replied to the email, blasting his ego and saying he should be 'ashamed' of his business practices. 

They added police would be called if he ignored the warning and added they would give him a refund for his Groupon because  'NO ONE in retail should have to deal with someone who's [sic] ego is as large as yours'.

Osushi opened in the lobby of The Westin Hotel in Boston’s Back Bay neighborhood in 2002, but closed last year.

Apologetic: Ran Duan, the son of the restaurant's owners who manages The Baldwin Bar, located inside the Woburn location of Sichuan Garden, responded to Edelman in a courteous way

After initially going to great lengths to get Sichuan Garden to credit him $12, Mr Edelman apologized profusely for his bullying behavior

The Sichuan Garden incident began on Friday when Edelman ordered $53.53 worth of takeout from the restaurant and was shocked when the bill was $4 more than he had added up using the online menu. 

The restaurant owner's son Ran Duan admitted that their website was 'out of date' and that the prices of each dish had gone up about $1, causing the Harvard Business School professor to send a barrage of threatening emails that were made public by Boston.com. 

He demanded a $12 refund - three times the amount he was overcharged - and also contacted local officials to demand the restaurant compensate all other customers who might have been affected.

But on Tuesday, Mr Edelman posted a message on his personal website admitting that his lengthy emails with Mr Duan were 'out of line' and that he has reached out to the restaurant to apologize.

'Having reflected on my interaction with Ran, including what I said and how I said it, it’s clear that I was very much out of line,' he wrote on his website.

'I aspire to act with great respect and humility in dealing with others, no matter what the situation. Clearly I failed to do so. I am sorry, and I intend to do better in the future.'

He added he had also reached out to the owner to apologize to him personally as well.

Mr Duan said he has been overwhelmed by the support he has received from people as far afield as Australia offering donations and support with his website and legal advice.

'I just want to make clear that we are not a business in financial distress. We have been blessed with the support of our amazing community and hospitality family that has understood the value of a hard working family. Your support and kind words are more then enough,' he wrote.

Duan said he had also increased an increase in business as a result of the publicity that the story had generated and that he had received 'overwhelming' support from Harvard graduates and the student body. 

'I believe that one man’s actions should not be the burden of another. I just want to apologize to Harvard for all the negative association they have been linked with this ordeal. I also believe that something good can come out of all this situation,' he wrote.

Duan manages The Baldwin Bar, located inside the Woburn location of Sichuan Garden, a Chinese restaurant founded by his parents and appeared in a recent issue of GQ hailed as 'America's Most Imaginative Bartender'.
