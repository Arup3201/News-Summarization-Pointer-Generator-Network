We all know that some artists put their blood, sweat and tears into their creations, but one woman has taken it one step further - by using her own vomit.

Cutting edge artist, Millie Brown, began pushing the boundaries of the art world after becoming sick - literally - of using more traditional methods of painting.

The eccentric artist - whose unique work
 features in Ripley’s Believe it or Not! - uses a selection of dyed soy 
milk in a mixture of colours which she then swallows at various 
intervals, one at a time, before vomiting it onto a white canvas.

But despite the regular retching, Millie, 27, insists it doesn’t affect her health. She said she maintains a healthy vegan lifestyle and always leaves a one month rest period between each performance.

The vomiting visionary began experimenting with her unique style back in 2005 and has since gained commercial success by regurgitating onto the dress of pop singer, Lady Gaga, in a controversial music video.

Despite having a general idea of what she'd like her work to look like, she prefers to improvise

Although some find the Londoner’s work somewhat hard to swallow, the artist has received positive recognition with critics comparing her to that of abstract expressionist, Jackie Pollock, who was known for his unique style of drip painting.

Despite having a general idea of what each canvas should look like, Millie prefers to improvise heavily throughout each performance.

Millie said 'I don’t eat for two days prior to performing so that I clean my stomach of any food, that way the only liquid that comes up is beautiful and of pure colour.

'I can drink anything from one pint to four litres depending on if I’m doing a live performance or creating a canvas piece.

She starves herself for two days before each performance to clear her stomach - but maintains she is still healthy

'It's definitely not recommended to put your body through this but I¿m generally a healthy person so I feel like that balances out the rest,' she says

Millie, who grew up in a Bohemian family, follows a vegan diet and only does a performance each month

'I time each drink so that each colour doesn’t mix in my stomach and try to space out my performances so that my body can recover properly.

'It’s very much about timing, I find the whole process fascinating and the long meditative fast can be very inspiring.

'I often set out with an idea of what I’d like to create but I enjoy the uncontrollable element of my work and just go with it.

'Filming can be exhausting, it can be an entire day of vomiting which leaves you with migraines but generally I feel good after performing, it’s like a cleanse for your body and mind.

Bohemian: Sleeping in abandoned buildings and driving around Europe in trucks became part of her everyday adventures

'I feel my work is an expression of 
raw human nature, that pushes boundaries mentally and physically to 
create work that has true beauty.

'There
 have been so many different reactions to my work, from laughing to 
crying, love and even death threats but I think art is made to make you 
feel and as long as it makes you feel something it can be powerful.

'It’s definitely not recommended to put 
your body through this but I’m generally a healthy person so I feel like
 that balances out the rest.'

Born in England to Bohemian parents and spending much of her youth in Spain and the South of France, it is clear where Millie’s maverick tendencies originated.

Aged 13 and unable to relate the French children of her neighborhood, Millie befriended local street punks.

From then on, sleeping in abandoned buildings and driving around Europe in trucks became part of her everyday adventures.

After
 a brief summer stint in L.A., Millie returned to London at the age of 
17 where she embarked upon her artistic journey in performance art and 
film.

Speaking about her quirky work, she said: 'I have an inherent desire to push my own boundaries within my art.

'By
 creating art from the very depths of my own physical being I am able to
 challenge people's perception of beauty, expressing raw elements of 
human nature and in turn challenging myself both physically and 
mentally.'
