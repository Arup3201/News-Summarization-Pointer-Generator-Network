Arjen Robben would already be playing in the Premier League if Brendan Rodgers had his way, according to former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher.

The Bayern Munich winger has been linked with a summer switch to Manchester United following his impressive performances for Holland at the World Cup.

Dutch coach Louis van Gaal, who will take charge at Old Trafford following the tournament in Brazil, has put 30-year-old Robben on his list of transfer targets.

But Sportsmail columnist Carragher has revealed how the Reds targetted Robben a year ago.

He said: 'Brendan Rodgers tried to sign him for Liverpool before the 2013 Champions League final.

'He wasn't a regular for Bayern then but he scored the winner at Wembley against Borussia Dortmund and has since gone from strength to strength.

'Liverpool have not had a world class wide man since John Barnes.'

The Red Devils missed out on Robben in 2004 as the club didn't meet PSV's evaluation of the player.

Sir Alex Ferguson offered the Dutch side £5m for the winger but the club rejected United's approach and then Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho swooped in with a £12m bid to take him to Stamford Bridge.

Robben moved to Real Madrid in 2007 and two years later he signed for Bayern Munich.
