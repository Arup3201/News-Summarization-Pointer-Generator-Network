Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told House Ways and Means Committee members on Wednesday that she expects health insurance rates to increase as the Affordable Care Act takes full effect.

'I think premiums are likely to go up,' she conceded under questioning, 'but go up at a slower pace' than they have already under Obamacare.

President Obama famously promised in 2008 and 2009 that his health insurance overhaul plan would lower the cost of health care for an average family by $2,500 per year.

And as a March 31 deadline approaches, the date when Americans will face fines if they don't have medical insurance, Sebelius told the panel that there will be 'no delay' in enforcing that so-called individual mandate.

A frustrated Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius fended off tough questions from Republicans who are still eager to cripple President Barack Obama's healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act

'How is that fair?' demanded Rep. Kevin Brady (R), talking about the administration's Obamacare delays affecting big businesses, but not individuals and families

Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services spokeswoman Julie Bataille said during a conference call on Tuesday that 'we have no plans to extend the open enrollment period' that began amid fits and starts on October 1.

'In fact, we don't actually have the statutory authority to extend the open enrollment period in 2014,' she said.

On Wednesday, Republican Ways and Means chairman Dave Camp asked Sebelius if she agreed.

'I haven’t seen their statements,' she replied, despite having been on the conference call, 'but there is no delay beyond March 31.' 

Republicans in Congress have castigated the Obama administration for failing to delay the individual mandate, even as it has made more than 35 changes to the Affordable Care Act, including some that defy date-specific deadlines in the written in the law's text.

One of those changes was a year-long delay in the employer mandate, which requires companies with 50 or more employees to certify that their workers are covered by medical insurance plans that meet Obamacare's strict minimum standards.

'If you delayed this law because it’s not workable for businesses, why aren’t you delaying this law because it’s not workable for our families?' blasted Texas GOP Rep. Kevin Brady during Wednesday's hearing.

'How is that fair?'

Georgia Rep. Tom Price demanded to know how many Obamacare enrollees have paid for their insurance plans, but Sebelius insisted 'I don't know that'

Sebelius appeared before the House Ways and Means Committee in a hearing about HHS's budget request for 2015

Nebraska Republican Sen. Deb Fischer lashed out at HHS for its insistence that it is prohibited from delaying for individuals what it has already relayed for large companies.

'It is puzzling that Secretary Sebelius is now concerned with a lack of statutory authority when it comes to delaying the individual mandate,' Fischer said in a statement. 'The administration has already issued nearly two dozen Obamacare delays, including those for big business and the president’s political allies.'

Fischer has introduced a bill that would explicitly give the White House the power to delay that individual mandate.

In your face: Nebraska GOP Sen. Deb Fischer has crafted a bill that would give HHS the authority to push back the individual mandate deadline as far as it likes

House Republicans are slated to vote this week on a similar bill, but the measure would face a certain veto at the White House.

Sebelius also insisted that she doesn't know how many Obamacare enrollees have paid for coverage and are actually insured.

'I can’t tell you because I don’t know that,' she told Georgia Republican Rep. Tom Price.

The Obama administration trumpeted new numbers on Tuesday showing that 4.2 million Americans have selected medical insurance policies during the open enrollment period

But a MailOnline analysis showed that in the seven states which have published both enrollment and payment numbers, insurers haven't seen payments from 21 per cent of those who have signed up.

If that percentage were to hold true nationally, HHS's boast of 4.2 million enrollments would shrink by 900,000.

Camp, a Michigan Republican, said Wednesday that the Affordable Care Act 'is not working as it was promised. And yet, the president’s budget doubles down on this law, requesting another $1.8 billion for its implementation.'

Democrats, however – including President Obama – are insisting that the law is performing as well as it was expected to.

Rep. Sander Levin, another Michigander who is the Democrats' ranking member on Ways and Means, charged that 'Republicans are so invested in making the Affordable Care Act a failure that they are blinded by the successes staring them in the face.'
