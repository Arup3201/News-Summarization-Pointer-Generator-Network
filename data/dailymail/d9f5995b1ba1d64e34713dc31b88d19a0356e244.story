A spectator who witnessed Australian cricketer Phil Hughes being struck by a ball that saw the sportsman rushed into emergency surgery has described the moment as 'chilling'.

Nine News' Will Dempsey was watching the match at Sydney Cricket Ground on Tuesday when Hughes, 25, collapsed face first on the pitch, following a brutal bouncer from Sean Abbott.

'I have still goosebumps. It was chilling,' Dempsey told Daily Mail Australia.

'There was this crack that echoed through the grounds. It was an eerie feeling, you knew something wasn't right.

'It didn't sound like leather hitting hard metal, it looked like a bouncer crept under his grill.'

Dempsey said as soon as Hughes hit the ground players ran to assist him, with wicketkeeper Brad Haddin rolling his teammate on to his side and doctors following close behind. 

'Tom Cooper and David Warner stayed by his side for more than half an hour,' Dempsey said.

Nine News reporter Will Dempsey was there to witness the moment and said players rushed to Hughes' side

'They worked on Phil for around 45 minutes.

'There was dead silence at the grounds. No one in the stands spoke or move. No one left, unless they were moving closer to Hughes to help.'

Dempsey said Hughes' teammates were distraught over the incident, which happened on day one of the Sheffield Shield between New South Wales and South Australia on Tuesday.

'Steve O'Keefe came off the ground crying. Hughes was loaded into one of two ambulances. It appeared that the helicopter landed at Paddington Barracks,' the spectator said.

'Steve Smith came to the stands, visibly distressed.

'Speaking with Moises Henriques and Mark Waugh, Steve motioned to indicate that Phil had been hit underneath his jawline.'

Dempsey said Sean Abbott - who had bowled the ball that struck Hughes - remained in the dressing room the entire time, while players comforted each other with many crying.

'It was the second ball to hit a player in five overs. It was fast bowling but Abbott's ball to Hughes was a bit sharper than usual,' Dempsey said.

The scene was total chaos as Hughes was taken away in an ambulance. 

'The ambulance changed direction to avoid the crowds. People and guards were yelling at people who were trying to take photos of Phil as they loaded him into the ambulance,' Dempsey said.

'Umpires were shouting "get away, get away"

'David Warner had been at Phil's side and walked up to his fiancee and daughter in the stands for a warm hug - he was really upset.'

NSW Blues assistant coach Geoff Lawson told 702 ABC radio he had never seen something like this before during his career in cricket.

'The ball was rising, his head's going away to the right, and it's hit him just on the back of the head under the helmet,' he said.

'The consequences of the injury I've probably never seen in my lengthy time in the game. Pretty quickly you could see he was in trouble. He fell over... and the way he collapsed was quite alarming.

'The fieldsman worked it out in a few seconds and signaled to the dressing room immediately. Sometimes you shake these things off - and this would be the other end of the scale.'
