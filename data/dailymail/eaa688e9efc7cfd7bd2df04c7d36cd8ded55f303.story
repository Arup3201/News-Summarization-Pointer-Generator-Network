A Chinese blogger who was accused of spreading rumours about the government and celebrities has been jailed for three years for 'rumour mongering'.

Marketing employee Qin Zhihui, 30, is believed to be the first person to be jailed since China's authorities announced a crackdown on online writers last August.

Authorities claimed a false post he wrote about a foreign victim of a 2011 train crash receiving £24million in compensation was reposted more than 11,000 times and commented on more than 3,000 times, inciting anger against the government.

Jailed: Qin Zhijun is led into court today in Beijing. He did not make a defence, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. China adopted draconian measures to crack down on online 'rumours' last year

Qin, from Hunan province, was also found guilty of spreading rumors 
about several celebrities including popular television hostess Yang Lan,
the state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

Chaoyang District People's Court heard the rumours were spread in 2012 and 2013 through Sina Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter.

China adopted draconian measures to crack 
down on online rumours last year.

People will be charged with defamation
 if posts that contain 'rumours' are visited by 5,000 internet users or 
reposted more than 500 times, according to a judicial interpretation 
issued by China's top court and prosecutor.

Confession: Qin issued a warning to other bloggers

Three years in jail is the maximum sentence.

Qin Zhihui, known as Qinhuohuo in cyberspace, was arrested last August and accused of impacting society and seriously harming social order with his posts, according to Xinhua.

But he made a confession to the court - and if he had not, would have been sentenced even more harshly.

'I don't want to defend myself,' he said, according to the South China Morning Post.

'I just want to say that I hope my experience is a lesson to other microbloggers.'

The court heard he exploited sensational cases like one of a Red Cross staffer with a lavish lifestyle to drive web traffic, the Morning Post added.

Other cases have also arisen.

Today a Chinese-American venture capitalist known for his controversial blogs was released on bail after nearly eight months in detention because of a 'serious illness'.

Charles Xue, also known as Xue Manzi, was detained in August on a charge of visiting prostitutes, an accusation that activists said stemmed from China's efforts to rein in social media.

His release came the morning after state television showed him making a confession and apologising to his wife and children.

China's crackdown on online 'rumour-mongering' is widely seen as a tool to halt criticism of the ruling Communist Party.

It has chilled political debate, with high-profile bloggers saying they have reined in sensitive posts for fear of detention.

The government claims the crackdown is necessary to preserve social stability.

Online
 rumours are particularly pervasive in China, where traditional media is
 heavily regulated by the government and public trust in the media is 
low.
