A space-age home built for country singer Darren Kozelsky in Texas is being sold for nearly $10 million.

The flying saucer-shaped home, with seven bedrooms, 13 bathrooms and an infinity pool, was built for the singer and his family in Preston Hollow, by architect Lionel Morrison in 2007.

Sleek fittings and floor-to-ceiling windows make the 14,795sq ft house, priced for $9.995 million, out of this world.

To infinity and beyond: A pool with waterfall curves around the courtyard in the center of the home

It was meticulously planned to create an organic living space within a modern shell, according to realtor.com.

Reflecting Morrison's passion for celebrating space, the reductionist-style home has seamless transitions between the living areas and gardens.

The contrast of modern and traditional styles can be seen with the mix of natural concrete and warm wood floors.

A sliding pane in one of the six living areas opens up the inside entertainment space with a central courtyard, that has a pool, seating areas and balconies.

Large windows throughout the home ensure it is filled with natural light, and a geothermal system is used for its heating and cooling needs.

The house has two kitchens - one for everyday use and a caterer's kitchen for parties and large gatherings.

Bright: Floor to ceiling windows and natural concrete floors create a feeling of space in the master bedroom

Seamless: Living space in the Lionel Morrison designed home flows effortless from room to room

Natural: Warm woods are used throughout the home to soften the ultra modern design

It also has plenty of living space, with two dining rooms, games room, gym, media room, hobby space, study and playroom for children.

A partial basement, which Kozelsky used for his music room, is included in the house, which was finished in 2009.

With seven bedrooms there is plenty of space for guests to stay after a party by the curved infinity pool, with waterfall.

But the main master bedroom brings luxury to a new level, with a private sitting room that has floor-to-ceiling windows looking over panoramic views.

Its bathroom is made from white limestone, shipped in from France, and there is an extensive closet area and a garden tub.

Retreat: Privacy walls prevent the need for blinds on the large windows that feature throughout

Storage: To keep this sleek house free from clutter, extensive closet space is available

While some may find the stark, modern design not to their taste, the listing points out  that natural light had been 'brilliantly planned' in the 'contemporary marvel'.

Realtors Allie Beth Allman & Associates, who are listing the property, said: 'As you move around the house, the rooms are completely open and create the ultimate space for entertaining.'
