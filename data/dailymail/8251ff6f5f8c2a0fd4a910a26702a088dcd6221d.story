Calvin Klein's on-off toyboy boyfriend and former porn star was involved in a bloody fist fight at an exclusive Hamptons nightclub at the weekend, it was alleged today.

Nick Gruber is accused of punching a man in the face in the early hours of Sunday morning in SL East in Southhampton before fleeing the scene.

Eye witnesses said his victim's face was covered in blood from a cut above his eyebrow and he had to be taken away in an ambulance.

Employees of the club were said to have been mopping up blood from the floor.

Back on? More than two years after their high-profile split, it seems Calvin Klein, 70, and Nick Gruber, a 23-year-old former porn star and model, have reconciled (pictured in 2011)

Around 20 police officers were called to the club and began a frenzied search for Gruber around the areas, sources told the New York Post's Page Six.

The model began his night at restaurant Sienna 
and Pink elephant, where guests included Bobby Flay.

He then moved on to
SL East which is where he got into the alleged brawl. Things moved outside after 
security removed them from the club and Gruber is alleged to have thrown
a security guard to the ground before fleeing.

Pink Elephant director of VIP relations Artin Bey Archer told the Post: 'It was a blood bath. The 
[other] guy had blood all over his face. I saw him on the ground, and he
was . . . taken away in an ambulance.

'Nick left before around six 
police cars arrived. Around 20 police officers started a full-scale 
manhunt using [flashlights] to search through the bushes.'

But the former porn star's spokesperson said he was acting in self defense and hasn't been arrested.

'The guy pushed him first, then there
was a bit more pushing. Nick punched him out of self-defense, and the 
guy suffered a cut above his eye. Nick is fine,' Matt Rich said.

'Nick 
did not flee the scene, the club security told him to leave. There were 
no cabs, so he walked to the main road to find one.

'He has not been questioned by the 
police. Nick does not know the guy, nor does he know why the guy started
pushing him. Unfortunately, when you are a well-known face, people 
target you for the wrong reasons.'

This is not the first time the 23-year-old has been in trouble with the law.

Gruber was arrested last April for 
attacking his friend Calvin Swint after they returned to Gruberâ€™s West 
Village penthouse apartment in New York following a night of partying.

When officers arrived at the 
penthouse shortly before 5am, they saw Gruber hide something down his 
pants before he tried to avoid getting handcuffed by waving his hands in
the air.

The model was later strip-searched at
the 6th Precinct in Manhattan, where police found cocaine stashed in 
his underwear, according to court papers.

Gruber was charged with possession of
a controlled substance, misdemeanor assault and resisting arrest. He 
pleaded guilty in August to one of the drug charges in a deal with 
prosecutors.

He checked into a rehab clinic soon after.

Calvin Klein, 70, dated the 
23-year-old for two years. they broke up in January 2012 but were 
pictured together again in May of this year.

The Post reported he took his toyboy to Mexico for a 'romantic break' a month after they were spotted at Chateau Marmont.

After their breakup, the blond-haired, blue-eyed model announced he was working on a book titled Obsession: My Life With Calvin Klein, where he claimed that the designer once made him take a lie-detector test.

Recalling the incident last spring, he told Page Six at the time: 'I passed it. And then, you know, things were much better. But I mean, what kind of partner would make you take a lie detector test?'
