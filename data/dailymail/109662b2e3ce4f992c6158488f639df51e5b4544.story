Parts of England and Wales faced the risk of flooding once again today after warnings of more heavy rain.

The Environment Agency urged people in Devon, Cornwall, west Somerset, North Wales and parts of the Midlands to remain prepared for the possibility of floods as the Met Office issued a weather warning for heavy rain.

Intense thundery downpours are expected this afternoon, which could lead to flash flooding in some areas.

Devon and Cornwall are at an increased risk of floods, and caravan and camping site operators across the South West should be ready to take action if flooding occurs, the Environment Agency said.

The Environment Agency currently has five flood warnings (meaning that flooding is expected) for rivers in place.

There are also 21 flood alerts for rivers across England and Wales, meaning that flooding is possible .

Today
the agency has sent equipment to pump out floodwaters in Newburn near 
Newcastle where a collapsed culvert led to a build up of water on the 
River Dene, and in Felpham and Bognor Regis where residents had to be 
evacuated after heavy rainfall flooded their homes earlier this week.

Sussex Police, West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service and council officers also said they were working together to evacuate people from flooded homes in the village of Elmer, near Bognor Regis, after reports of flooding of up to 6ft in some homes.

They used inflatable boats to reach 250 vulnerable homes, knocking on doors and searching properties to make sure people were safe and received the help they needed, a Sussex Police spokeswoman said.

Residents were taken to Arun Leisure 
Centre in Felpham, West Sussex, and 10 people are being looked after and
offered the support of designated housing officers to help find 
accommodation and liaise with insurance companies, she added.

Chief Superintendent Paul Morrison 
said: 'I can assure residents that working with partner agencies we are 
doing all we can to care for those affected by the floods.

'We are constantly reviewing the 
situation with partners and have created a multi- agency adverse weather
office to coordinate our response.'
Nigel Croad, deputy chief executive of Arun District Council, said: 'As a
district council our role is to support the emergency services in their
response to this incident and working with others our priority is 
always to help people who have been evacuated from their homes, ensuring
they have somewhere safe and dry to stay and helping with housing 
advice.

'Three rest centres have been set up across the district in the last 24 hours in response to the exceptional weather conditions.

Further unsettled weather is predicted for the rest of the week, and the Environment Agency is keeping a close watch on river levels, after heavy rain has left many areas more vulnerable to flooding.

Environment Agency teams have been working round the clock, with other emergency responders, checking flood defences, clearing blockages, monitoring river levels and issuing flood warnings.

The Environment Agency urged the public to remain vigilant and check its website and Twitter feed for the latest situation.

It also advised the public to stay away from swollen rivers and not to drive through floodwater.

A spokesperson for the Met Office said: 'A good portion of the UK will be sunny dry and sunny today, but there will also be some heavy showers across certain regions.'

Meanwhile three of the UK’s biggest water 
companies are lifting hosepipe bans, imposed to deal with drought, 
following weeks of heavy rain, from midnight tonight.

Anglian Water, Thames Water and 
Southern Water are to end restrictions because of the ‘exceptional’ 
rainfall over the last three days, on top of April’s record levels.

Seven water companies across southern
and eastern England brought in hosepipe bans after two unusually dry 
winters left some groundwater supplies and rivers as low as in the 
drought year of 1976.

But
the restrictions were followed by record rainfall across the UK in 
April and more rain in May and the beginning of June, leading to 
flooding in some areas.

Richard
Aylard, sustainability director for Thames Water, said: 'While we 
prepared for worst, bringing in restrictions to save water to ensure 
there would be enough if the dry spell continued, the topsy-turvy 
British weather had other ideas.

'We
are really pleased we can now lift the ban but, with groundwater levels
still low and the possibility of a third successive dry winter, we 
still need to be careful. We don’t need a ban, but we do need to ask 
everyone to keep on using water wisely.'

Southern
Water’s water quality and strategy manager Meyrick Gough said: 'While 
our focus remains firmly on dealing with the aftermath of the torrential
rain and flooding in the south over the last few days, it is also right
for us to lift the water restrictions.'

In
its latest drought briefing last week, the Environment Agency said the 
wet weather had significantly reduced the risk of drought and widespread
water restrictions this summer.

River levels and reservoir stocks 
have improved significantly and further water restrictions for the 
public and businesses are unlikely, the Government agency said.

But
groundwater levels are still well below normal in some areas, with some
as low as in the drought year of 1976, and are unlikely to improve 
before the winter.

Companies which rely primarily on underground aquifers for supplies are maintaining their hosepipe bans.

Mike Pocock, water resources manager 
of Veolia Water Central, said: 'Months of wet weather, particularly 
during the next autumn and winter period, will be needed to restore 
groundwater to normal levels.

'The
current temporary use ban, which includes hosepipe usage, has been 
assisting to reduce demand and conserve our water resources and we would
like to thank our customers for their incredible support.

'Unfortunately,
at present we will not be relaxing the temporary use ban further, as we
need to conserve our supply of water to prepare for the possibility of a
third dry autumn and winter.'

Meanwhile Britain's washout summer has caused a slimy new problem for farmers - an invasion of millions of crop munching slugs.

The
wet spring and summer has produced ideal breeding conditions for the 
creatures now hungrily devouring crops after multiplying rapidly.Farmer Phil Thomas of Linscombe Farm organics, near Exeter, Devon, has been particularly badly hit.

The
carrots and aubergines he grows organically have been decimated by the 
pests which get under the edges of his polythene greenhouses.

And because he doesn’t use pesticides it means he is faced with a horror job of killing as many slugs as possible - by hand.

He said: 'The crops have taken a hammering.

'The slugs eat the growing tips out of the middle of the plant which really knocks the plant back.

'We have to come in the middle of the night and pick them off the plants.

'Then you have to either drown them or crush them - it’s not the nicest of jobs.

'You have to wear gloves because you’ll never get the slime off your fingers otherwise.'

A spokesman for the National Farmers Union said the slug infestation was disastrous.

He said: 'On a good night a slug can munch its way through 50 wheat seeds after they’ve been planted.

'They can travel over five metres a night, they can smell food over 60 centimetres away and then they’re all over it.

'They’re not good news.'
