In Northern Sweden, the word for 'yes' is undeniably hard to pronounce.

While the rest of the country opts for the Swedish word 'ja' to vocalise their agreement, in the city of Umea, located over 600km from the capital, a unique sound is used instead.

In the video, Oliver Gee of the Swedish edition of European news site The Local, asks passersby to demonstrate and attempts to learn the local dialect.

Gee approaches several city dwellers in the video, asking each of them how they say 'yes' and if they could teach him to say it too.

Among the best advice given, includes one woman who instructs to 'just [imagine] if you have a mint in your mouth.'

When Gee asks why the population of Umea prefers the sound, which is similar to that of sucking on a straw, another woman gives a rather simple explanation.

The city in Northern Sweden doesn't use 'ja' to vocalise their agreement, but a sucking sound instead

'Its just an easy way to say it,' she offers. 'You don't have to open your mouth.'

In a country known for its strange habits and loveable quirks, Swedes also take pride in words like 'fika' and 'logom.'

Fika refers to 'a coffee and cake break,' while logom simply means 'just the right amount.'

The video was uploaded just a week ago and already has almost 2 million views

The Swedish Language Council has also recently added 40 new entries to the dictionary for 2015. 

Among them 'usie,' which refers to a self-portrait (or selfie) photo and 'spoilervarning,' which acts as a warning if someone is about to spoil the plot of a book or film.

The video of this peculiar sound was uploaded by The Local Europe just a week ago and has amassed almost 2 million views so far.
