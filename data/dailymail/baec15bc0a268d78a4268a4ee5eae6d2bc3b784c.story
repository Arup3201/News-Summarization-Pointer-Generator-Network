Ever since his wife passed away two years ago, Martin Conway has tended to her grave, regularly leaving pots of flowers in tribute.

Now the 85-year-old former insurance broker has been told that this ritual must stop. And you can probably guess why.

Yes, the local council has decreed that grieving relatives cannot leave flowers on graves at the cemetery because of health and safety fears. 

Martin Conway, 85, has been told he cannot leave flowers at his wife's grave because of health and safety

Officials said they put the rules in place several years ago after a cemetery worker cut his knee on a piece of broken pot.

And they claim there have been complaints that tributes have blown away making the area untidy.

But that did little to ease the distress caused to Mr Conway, who received a letter from Cromer Town council in Norfolk on the second anniversary of his wife Pat’s death.

Mr Conway said: ‘It was a complete bombshell when this letter arrived. I have never been so upset by anything. Health and safety just seems to be an issue for everything these days.

‘When you go to a cemetery to stand by the grave of a loved one, putting a few flowers there is a great mark of respect and love. The regulations stopped that.’

The letter sent to Mr Conway and other families stated flowers could only be left on graves of those who have been cremated if the memorial slabs have a vase built into them.

However, relatives who tend to larger plots of those who have not been cremated are allowed to leave floral tributes.

Mr Conway, a former parish councillor who was married for nearly 60 years, said: ‘It is grossly unfair that the rule only applies to plots where ashes are buried and not normal graves. How can they produce such a rule, putting those of us whose relatives were cremated at a huge disadvantage? I cannot believe  any town councillor could make such a distinction.

‘I was not aware of the rules when my wife was cremated. I normally read everything I get, but I don’t recall getting a leaflet or anything.

‘I didn’t get a tablet with a vase inserted in it because I didn’t think they looked as nice from an aesthetic point of view.

‘I have put a plastic pot containing flowers on there every month or so without any problem and none of the pots have ever blown over even in quite a strong wind.’

Mr Conway said the council’s letter stated that unauthorised pots of flowers would be removed from the cemetery from April. But he is hoping councillors will have a change of heart and relax the rules at their next meeting.

Yesterday council clerk Julie Chance said:  ‘These rules and regulations have been in place for years and years. The reason is to make the maintenance of the cemetery easier. We had an accident up there when a member of staff knelt down to do some work and cut his knee on broken glass from a vase.

‘The rules apply to everyone and we just felt it was time to remind people about them.  We are trying to be as helpful as we can and if there are special cases, we will work with people to find a solution.

‘We have contacted all relatives to remind them of the rules. First of all, we telephoned them if we had numbers for them, then we put out a press release and we followed it up by writing to them. If any families have concerns they should phone the town council to discuss matters and if necessary make an appointment to meet to discuss it further.’

Mr Conway and his wife married in 1954 and went on to have three children and three grandchildren.

They moved to their favourite holiday destination of Norfolk after they retired 25 years ago. Mrs Conway died aged 81 in January 2012.
