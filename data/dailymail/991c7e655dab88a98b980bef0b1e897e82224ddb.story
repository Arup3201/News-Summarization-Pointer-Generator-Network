A woman received a letter in her mailbox more than 45 years after it was posted but only received an apology for the poor condition of the envelope.

Anne Tingle, from Calgary, Alberta, Canada was sent the letter in 1969 from her then nine-year-old sister, Esther thanking her for allowing to stay with her over the summer.

But despite being lost in the post for more than four decades, the letter arrived in plastic with a note from Canada Post apologising for the condition of the envelope, but not the huge delay.

Mrs Tingle holds up her letter from her sister, which she recieved after being lost in the post for 45 years

Mrs Tingle says her sister Ester can't even remember sending the letter, which cost six-cent, but was amused by the contents of the written note, which included a poem and an invite.

The letter was sent in the same year Apollo 11 first put man on the moon.

That trip was 238,000 miles and took just three days compared to the 45 years it took for Mrs Tingle's letter to travel less than 125 miles.

But despite the delay, Mrs Tingle praised Canada Post for eventually reunited her with her piece of post.

The hand written letter from her sister Esther thanked Mrs Tingle for allowing her to stay during the summer and also included a poem and an invite

She told CTV News: 'It doesn't even have an address on it.

'Kudos to Canada Post. They got it to me with no address to work with and only six cents to spur it on.'

Her sister Esther also added: 'I was blown away. It is like getting back a piece of history.'

Speaking to the Calgary Sun she also added: 'Had it been news of a huge inheritance that I'm now far too late to collect, then it would be a different story.

Canada Post apologised for the poor condition of the envelope rather than the long delay

'This was a lovely surprise.'

Anick Losier, a spokeswoman for Canada Post, said: 'In this particular case we're still not able to explain it, and in some cases it remains a mystery - I wish I knew the answer.

'What's really great though is I'm sure this made her day - we wish it had been on time, but we're really, really happy it got delivered.'
