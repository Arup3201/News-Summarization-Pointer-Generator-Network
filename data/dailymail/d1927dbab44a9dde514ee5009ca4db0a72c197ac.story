A left-wing newspaper mocked the death of an Eton schoolboy who was mauled on an Arctic expedition.

The Socialist Worker claimed the incident was ‘another reason to save the polar bears’.

Horatio Chapple was just 17 when he was dragged from his tent by the 39-stone animal.

The newspaper column – timed to coincide with Horatio’s inquest – pokes fun at his privileged background and implies his death was somehow justified.

The ‘tasteless’ article, which appeared on page 2 in the ‘Troublemaker’ section and is still available online, ran under the deeply offensive headline: ‘Eton by bear? The inquest begins.’

It concludes: ‘Troublemaker has long supported campaigning for the environment. Now we have another reason to save the polar bears.’

Adrian Weale, 50, whose son was in the same year as Horatio at Eton, condemned the piece as ‘disgusting’.

The writer and Army Reserve officer said: ‘That the Socialist Worker thinks the violent death of a child is a fit subject for humour indicates a level of depravity and insensitivity to the suffering of others which is surprising.

‘The paper should undoubtedly apologise to the family of Horatio and take a long hard look at their editorial process.

‘The headline was written in an inane and stupid way and using a polar bear to fuel a class war is simply ludicrous. They should not place this extreme view onto an article which deals with the tragic death of a child.’

The newspaper is the mouthpiece for the Socialist Workers Party, which describes itself as ‘possibly the largest far-left group in Britain.’ It was yesterday condemned by critics across the political spectrum.

Author Bobby Friedman accused the Socialist Worker of ‘thinking it’s OK to laugh at a child dying because he went to Eton’.

Broadcaster and Guardian columnist Owen Jones wrote on Twitter: ‘Horrible. This is not socialism’

The writer and musician Sean Fleming sent a message to the Socialist Worker’s official Twitter account, saying: ‘The Troublemaker piece is beyond appalling.

'As a socialist and a worker, you don’t speak for me.’

Dylan Morris wrote: ‘I know someone else who was on this trip and only JUST survived. The Socialist Worker is scum made print.’

Stockport councillor Iain Roberts, a Liberal Democrat, said: ‘Saw the article this morning – disgusting that Socialist Worker is gleefully crowing over the death of a child.

'Was glad to see others on the Left also appalled.’

The article follows abuse Horatio’s family received on Facebook after his death in August 2011.

Internet trolls created vile profiles on Facebook which mockingly ‘mourned’ the killer polar bear.

A spokesman for the Socialist Worker was not immediately available for comment when contacted by the Daily Mail.

A spokesman for Horatio’s parents, GP Olivia and surgeon David, said they were unable to comment on the article.

Yesterday, their son’s inquest heard how Horatio was killed by an elderly bear suffering from worn-down teeth. The pain it was in would have made it ‘aggressive and unpredictable’.

Horatio was killed during a £4,000 trip organised by the British Schools Exploring Society (BSES). Four others were hurt before the bear was shot dead at their camp site.

Horatio, from Salisbury, Wiltshire, had recently finished his penultimate year at Eton, the prime minister’s former public school which charges more than £11,000 a term.

Horatio had hoped to study medicine at university, following in the footsteps of his parents. His grandfather, Field Marshal Sir John Lyon Chapple, was head of the British Army from 1989 to 1992 and was governor of Gibraltar from 1993 to 1995.

The Chapples’ local MP, John Glen, said last night: ‘I am shocked and appalled by what I have read in the Socialist Worker.

‘These vile words will appal everyone in and around Salisbury.

‘To see such vulgar words is utterly comprehensible and I hope a full apology will be forthcoming.

‘It seems focus on where Horatio went to school has provoked a reaction – and what a warped view of the world it shows.’
