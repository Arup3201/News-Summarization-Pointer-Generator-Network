QPR have made an enquiry for Marseille striker Andre Ayew currently playing for Ghana

SIMON JONES: West Ham trialist Marcus Nilsson will hold talks with Birmingham City on Monday.

The 6ft 4ins Swedish centre-back had a two week trial at West Ham but manager Sam Allardyce allowed the 26-year-old to go and pursue other options on Friday.

ROB DRAPER: Arsenal are lining up a defensive midfielder to add to their signing of centre-half Gabriel – but they don’t expect to be able to complete any deals until the summer.

The club is not anticipating further business because the identified targets, Christoph Kramer and Morgan Schneiderlin, are not available at present.

Arsenal’s prime target is Kramer but the German midfielder has just signed a new contract which means he will leave his loan spell at Borussia Moenchengladbach and join his parent club Bayer Leverkusen in the summer.

News from Italy and Inter Milan have enquired about Davide Santon at Newcastle

Crystal Palace have made their third signing inside the space of a week as Senegal international defender Pape Souare completed a move from Lille for an undisclosed fee.

Eagles' boss Alan Pardew tasted defeat for the first time since taking over at the turn of the year, seeing his side lose 1-0 at home to Everton on Saturday, and has now moved to strengthen his defence.

Souare, 24, came through the ranks at Lille and has signed a three-and-a-half year deal at Selhurst Park, subject to a work permit being issued - and joins Jordon Mutch and Shola Ameobi in moving to Palace in the last seven days.

SIMON JONES: QPR target Paul-Jose M'Poku is poised to link up with Gianfranco Zola at Cagliari instead. The 22-year-old former Tottenham winger had been discussing a possible loan to Loftus Road from Standard Liege.

ROB DRAPER: Southampton will have to pay £5m if they want Feyenoord midfielder Tonny Vilhena, with the Dutch club reluctant to sell for any less, meaning Ronaldo Koeman and Les Reed have to decide whether to move today to bolster their midfield or wait until the summer.

The 20-year-old midfielder played in Koeman’s Feyenoord team last season but hasn’t enjoyed the same success under new manager Fred Rutten and is keen to join Southampton.

But the south-coast club will have to meet Feyenoord’s valuation with Vilhena having been a star of the Dutch Under-17 teams and considered on the countries brightest talents.

Reed, the executive director at the club, will decide today whether Southampton can bid £5m, following the £3million departure of Jack Cork to Southampton.

Watford and Brentford are keen on a loan for Leicester defender Liam Moore.

SIMON JONES: Inter Milan have started talks with Fiorentina about a potential deal for Micah Richards.

The 26-year-old is on loan from Manchester City and played for the Premier League champions in the Community Shield against Arsenal.

The Italians have been checking to see if this will count as a competitive match so potentially scupper the deal under FIFA's three club rule.

SIMON JONES: West Ham have decided not to offer Swedish trialist Marcus Nilsson a contract despite the defender impressing during an extended two week trial.

Sam Allardyce anticipates Winston Red will stay until the summer so has decided that other positions are a priority.

Nilsson said: 'It is disappointing not to be offered a contract but I understand the situation and would like to thank West Ham for the opportunity, training with players like Andy Carroll, Alex Song and Kevin Nolan can only be a good thing for me, and manager Sam Alladyce has been excellent.'

Nilsson, who is a free agent, is resuming talks with other teams as he seeks a new club. He added: 'I think my style of football will suit the English game, I am 6ft 4in and quick, at West Ham during a speed test, I was the fastest player at the club.

'I have got several offers from teams in Scandinavia but my ambition is to play in England and get back into the Swedish national team.'

SIMON JONES: Slight delay in formal confirmation of Juan Cuadrado to Chelsea is apparently down to a claim of five percent sell on from his previous club Independiente Medellin.

Cuadrado was in the stands at Stamford Bridge on Saturday with his agent Alessandro Lucci 

SIMON JONES: Fenerbahce have shown an interest in taking Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko to Turkey.

Fenerbahce president Aziz Yeldrim is willing to pay £12m for the Bosnia international but City are likely to wait until the summer before considering a sale despite the arrival of Wilfried Bony.

The 28-year-old Dzeko came on as a late substitute in Saturday's draw at Stamford Bridge but has only scored four goals this season after a return of 26 last year as City claimed the Premier League title.

Barnsley are keen on Hamilton midfielder Tony Andreu. The 26-year-old Frenchman has scored 25 goals in 57 games for the Scottish side and 13 in 25 games this season.

New York City have shown an interest in Chesterfield striker Eoin Doyle.

The 26-year-old scored his 25th goal of the season against Doncaster on Saturday and his goals have also drawn enquiries from Sheffield United and Preston.

SIMON JONES: West Bromwich Albion have revived their interest in Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher after his move to West Ham collapsed.

Fletcher, 30, was poised to sign for the Upton Park club after travelling to London on Friday to undergo a medical and discuss terms.

However, after further talks, West Ham then tried to make the transfer a loan rather than a permanent deal and Fletcher and United pulled the plug.

ROB SHEPHERD: West Ham are bracing themselves for frenetic transfer deadline activity.

Boss Sam Allardyce wants to hold onto his squad as they seek a top six Barclays Premier League finish and an assault on the FA Cup.

But even though Chelsea have secured to services of Juan Cuadrado from Fiorentina for £26.8million, the Blues may yet follow a bid for Ecuadorian international Enner Valencia who joined the Hammers last summer from Pachuca for £12million after impressing at the World Cup.

A bid in the region of £20m plus is believed to be the fee. West Ham would be willing to increase Valencia's personal terms to stay but the player may yet force a move.

If that is the case then West Ham would follow interest in Swansea's £8m-rated Bafetimbi Gomis.
