NASCAR driver Kurt Busch has been ordered to stay away from his ex-girlfriend Patricia Driscoll, who he claimed was an 'assassin', after he allegedly grabbed her by the face and throat and slammed her head into the wall three times. 

Busch will not be allowed to buy or possess firearms or ammunition, must undergo evaluation for 'mental health problems related to anger control', and must stay 100 yards away from Driscoll - with the exception of NASCAR races and related events - for one year.

A Delaware judge passed down the no-contact order on Monday after four days of testimony in December and January that featured a number headline-grabbing claims.

NASCAR driver Kurt Busch has been ordered to stay away from his ex-girlfriend Patricia Driscoll, who he claimed was an 'assassin', after he allegedly  slammed her head into the wall three times

Busch and Driscoll attend court in December. For the length of a year, Busch will not be allowed to buy or possess firearms or ammunition and must stay 100 yards away from Driscoll

Driscoll,  37, testified that she and her son went to Busch's motorhome at the Dover International Speedway the night of the assault after receiving a slew of worrying texts from the racecar driver that seemed to indicate he was depressed.

In one text, Driscoll said Busch, 36, told her that he was lying on the floor and crying, unsure 'which way was up'. In another he said he didn't 'love anything right now'. 

The couple had broken up a week before the alleged assault in September following a fight after one of Busch's races. 

Driscoll said after she entered the home, her ex-boyfriend accused her of 'having spies everywhere and having a camera on the bus to watch him'. 

Then, she said in documents filed in November, he jumped up, grabbed her face and smashed her head three times against the wall next to the bed before she ran to a nearby bus to put an ice pack on her head and neck. 

Driscoll said she suffered severe pain, difficulty breathing and bruising on her neck following the assault.  

Busch testified that he was having a spiritual experience after watching Brad Pitt's 'Seven Years In Tibet' and was naked and sobbing on the floor when Driscoll showed up at his home. 

He said he repeatedly asked Driscoll to leave as she demanded that he tell her son 'to his face' that the couple were no longer together, according to CBS News. 

Busch said he only touched Driscoll when he cupped her cheeks with his hand so he could look her in the eye when he told her again to leave his home.

Busch said he repeatedly told Driscoll to leave his home and only touched her when he cupped her cheeks with his hand. A Dover police detective testified that Busch had said Driscoll's head then 'tapped' the wall

A Dover police detective testified that Busch had said Driscoll's head then 'tapped' the wall. 

In his testimony, Busch said he could never have laid a hand on Driscoll because she was a trained assassin and a 'badass' who told him she had killed people before.

He told the court, 'I know that she could take me down at any moment', and said his former girlfriend had once shown him images of dead bodies with gunshot wounds, as well as a scar from a stab wound on her stomach. 

He also said Driscoll once came home in an evening gown covered in blood and had told him 'I take down foreign governments. I own Washington'. 

Driscoll, a narcotics and homeland security consultant for a defense consulting firm in Washington, D.C., called the allegations 'ludicrous' and said Busch had ripped them from a screenplay she wrote and asked him to read.

Conflicting testimony came not only from the former couple, but from supposed witnesses who had seen Driscoll following the fight. 

One of Driscoll's neighbors testified that she saw marks on the woman's face and neck hours after the alleged assault. 

NASCAR chaplain Nick Terry said he and his wife saw Driscoll 'immediately after the alleged assault' and did not see any marks on her. 

In court Driscoll said that Terry was being threatened and bribed by Busch's attorneys, claims he denies.

In addition to the protection order with family court, Driscoll also filed a criminal complaint to Dover police. 

The Delaware attorney general's office has not yet decided whether to prosecute Busch. Police submitted their findings from their investigation more than a month ago. 

NASCAR released a statement following the family court's ruling and said they 'fully recognize the serious nature of this specific situation and the broader issue of domestic violence' and will await the attorney general's decision to 'determine our course of action'. 

'We are relying on authorities in Delaware and their collective experience to identify all the facts.' 

Busch's attorney said he plans to appeal the family court's decision.   

Known as 'the Outlaw' in racing circles, Busch has a reputation for his temper. 

Busch was fined $50,000 by NASCAR in 2011 after a fan filmed him verbally abusing an ESPN reporter and posted the video on YouTube, and was suspended again for a race in 2012 after verbally attacking another reporter.
