Facebook has revealed that the majority of photos which users flagged as 'offensive' during 2011 are actually just ones people are embarassed about.

The company revealed that no matter how much you dislike a photo, it won't take it down simply because you don't like how you like - or even if you're caught doing something you want to hide.

When Facebook investigates an 'offensive' post, it will take it down only if it proves to be genuinely offensive. 

The company's engineering director, Arturo Bejar, revealed in a radio interview that the majority of reports of 'offensive' pictures in 2011 weren't actually offensive, when the company investigated - they're just pictures that people don't like.

People don't own the copyright to photographs other people have taken of them, even on Facebook, so the site will not remove an image simply because someone doesn't like it.

'So we usually sit down with the people who process the reports as 
they come in,' said Bejar. 'We're going for 
photo after photo, and they're reported for violence or 
drug use or pornography.

'And we're looking at the photos and we're 
there's absolutely nothing wrong with that photo. That photo is fine.'

'Then we noticed that the 
person who was reporting the photo happens to be in the photo. And so we
 began digging.'

There are more than 250 million photos posted to Facebook every day.

In the interview, on NPR's 'Talk of the Nation', Bejar spoke to someone who wanted a photo of them at a political meeting removed in case it offended their boss.

He said that Facebook would not remove photos for that reason, and advised the user to contact the photographer instead.

Last year, so many people 'misused' the option to report 'Offensive' posts that Facebook added another option to the page, to allow miffed users to message their friends and ask them to take the pictures down.

In the new version of the page, users are given the option to flag a picture as 'I don't like this picture of me,' or 'This picture is harassing me' which will send a message to the person who posted it.

Facebook claims that this move helps people resolve picture problems.

The blog AllThingsD commented, 'The thing is, you don’t necessarily own the rights to a picture someone else takes of you, and Facebook accentuates the awkwardness of that situation.'

'Since Facebook users upload an average of more than 250 million photos per day, this is a way for the company to patrol its site without employing warehouses full of people scanning pictures for violence and nudity.'
