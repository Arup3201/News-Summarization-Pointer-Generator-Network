Sky Sports News have pulled reporters from the streets on deadline day to avoid a repeat of last year's chaos.

The rolling TV channel was forced to reconsider its tactics after a series of problems during their live transfer coverage in September.

This included one journalist trying to report the latest updates as a fan crept up behind him and shoved a sex toy in his ear.

Sky Sports News have now taken the decision to place their reporters inside stadiums and training grounds, rather than outside the gates in public areas.

Transfer deadline day is one of the most popular events of the year for the station as clubs attempt to sign players before the window closes.

But the day has become increasingly difficult to organise and they have now taken action.

Alan Irwin was posted at Everton in September and was forced to continue a live broadcast while one fan thrust a sex toy into his ear.

Kaveh Solhekol, meanwhile, was removed from his station at Selhurst Park after a demonstration by a Crystal Palace supporters’ group - Holmesdale Fanatics - against Sky Sports’ football coverage.

The group chanted 'we f***ing hate Sky Sports' and carried a long banner that read 'SKY SPORTS – KILLING OUR GAME SINCE 1992'. 

The constant use of bad language from some fans left Sky Sports with no option but to cut straight back to the studio, leaving presenters to apologise to viewers.

Identifying the potential for embarrassment, Arsenal allowed the Sky reporter designated to the Gunners for the day to shoot inside the Emirates Stadium. 

At the time, a Sky spokesman said: 'Millions of viewers followed our coverage of Transfer Deadline Day which included over 270 live reporter updates from outside football clubs over the final 24 hours. 

'We apologise to those whose enjoyment was spoiled by a small number of incidents and we’re looking into ways to avoid this happening again in the future whilst ensuring fans remain a key part our live coverage.'
