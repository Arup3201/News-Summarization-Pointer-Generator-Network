Pensioners should be allowed to continue driving until they are 80 before having to renew their licences, according to a review by transport officials.

They are urging ministers to relax the current mandatory renewal age of 70 to save money and make the Drivers and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) more efficient.

But safety campaigners warn the move could cost lives and insisted regulations for older drivers should be strengthened, not relaxed.

The DVLA is groaning under the weight of 
renewal applications from pensioners who still want to drive in their 
70s, according to the review by the Department for Transport (DfT) said.
 It argues for the age limit to be raised ‘to reduce the burden of 
regulation.’

Currently drivers must send their licence to be renewed when they reach 70, declaring if they have any medical conditions which could affect their driving, and confirming they can still read a number plate  at 65ft. After 70, they must reapply every three years to keep driving.

But with the population living longer while still being fit to drive, the DVLA is finding it hard to cope.

Nearly 60 per cent of over 70s now drive – up 15 per cent from 1975. Over the past decade the number of drivers the DVLA medically assesses a year has jumped more than 50 per cent, from under 500,000 to 750,000. The agency now deals with 1.4 million items of ‘medical mail’ a year.

Mary Reilly, a non-executive director of the DfT, who was asked by ministers to write the review – published last week – said that the DVLA, which costs £420million a year to run, must become ‘significantly more efficient, and provide better value for money’.

She said raising the renewal age could relieve pressure on the DVLA ‘with little or no impact on road safety’.

Ministers should ‘consider whether the existing requirement to renew a driving licence at age 70 is still appropriate’, she says.

‘A number of European countries renew driving licences at age 80 or have no limit at all. Early analysis of information held by DVLA suggests this could be introduced with little or no impact on road safety.’

But a report published last year by the RAC and Transport Research Laboratory found ten per cent of Britain’s four million drivers over 70 were not fit to be behind the wheel.

Safety campaigners say the move could cost lives. Research by the RAC suggests 10 per cent of drivers over 70 are not fit to be behind the wheel

Safety organisations also warned last night the change could lead to more serious accidents on Britain’s roads.Kevin Clinton, of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, said: ‘Changing the renewal age from 70 to 80 should only be done on the basis of evidence that this would not increase risk.’

A spokesman for road safety charity Brake said: ‘It is concerning the DfT is considering raising the age for licence renewal. The regulation that’s in place is there for a reason. At this age, conditions that can significantly impair your ability to drive safely become much more common, so it’s essential we have robust procedures to ensure older drivers are not inadvertently putting themselves and others in grave danger.’

She said Ministers should strengthen rules for older drivers, not weaken them.

A DfT spokesman said: ‘The review of the DVLA has made several recommendations to improve the efficiency of the service. Any change to the current driving licence renewal age would require extensive consultation and no decisions have been made.’
