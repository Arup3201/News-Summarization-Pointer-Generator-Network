A 10-year-old boy has been accidentally shot dead by his 14-year-old brother after the teenager started playing with what he believed was an unloaded shotgun in Texas, police have said.

Jackson Roberts, a fourth grader and talented baseball player, was reportedly sitting in a cabin in Lubbock on Friday night when his sibling pointed the weapon at him and shot him in the chest.

He managed to stumble over to his father, who was outside the cabin at the time, before being rushed to Childress Regional Medical Center. But despite medics' best efforts, he shortly died.

It is unknown how Jackson's brother came across the gun, but it is believed to belong to the pair's father. Officers told KTRE there is nothing to suggest the incident was not an accident. 

They said the teenager thought the weapon was unloaded when he shot his younger brother in the upper left chest area, causing a fatal injury.

On Monday, Jackson's teammates at Southwest Little League reportedly gathered at their fields to remember their friend and pray, while the number 51 was displayed on the scoreboards.

'That speaks tremendous amounts about not just the type of kid he is, but the family, too,' one of the players' sisters, Kayla Crow, who described Jackson as 'fun but fearless'.
