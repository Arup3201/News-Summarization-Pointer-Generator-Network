An Alabama grand jury has indicted a former teacher and cheerleading coach on eight counts of rape and sodomy of a boy under the age of sixteen.

Sixth-grade teacher Jennifer Collins McNeill, 39, was arrested last year and charged with six counts of rape and two counts of sodomy of a juvenile male - some of the alleged encounters took place on school grounds.

McNeill who was also a cheerleading coach, is accused of having an inappropriate relationship with the sixteen year-old student between April 2012 and June 2013. The boy did not attend the school where she taught.

Accused: Jennifer Collins McNeill is alleged to have had a sexual affair with a boy aged between 12 and 16 from April 2012 to June 2013

Sheriff Kevin Davis says his office 
began investigating allegations that McNeill was having sex with a 
student after they got a call from the Department of Human Resources.

'A
 very good investigation has been done. In my opinion, some very strong 
evidence has been collected throughout that investigation,' Sheriff 
Davis said.

The married teacher's arrest stunned school chiefs who later resigned from her posting at the school.

'That we're all shocked and disappointment doesn't describe it,' said Chilton County Schools Superintendent Dave Hayden.

Chilton County Chief Deputy District Attorney C.J. Robinson confirmed on Monday, 'It's embarrassing for the schools system, and it's not fun for anybody involved, but it's something that we have to face now and, based on her choices, here we go,'

McNeill's attorney says any comment about her client and the charges pending would be premature at this point.

Scene: McNeill worked at Thorsby High School where she primarily taught six graders and was also a sponsor for the cheerleading team.

Warrants filed in court show that McNeill is charged with having had sexual intercourse with a juvenile male less than 16 years of age, but older than 12, between April 10, 2012 and June 28 of 2013.

The juvenile does not go to school at Thorsby, but is a student in the county.

Sheriff Davis told WTOX parents had to be able to trust teachers.

He said: 'I dropped off my 12-year-old this morning for the first day of school like other parents across this county and the state for that matter.

'I take a certain amount of responsibility for those kids through school resource officers and us trying to keep them protected through that side, but we also entrust, as parents, a lot of trust to teachers and principals and administrators of the school system.'

McNeill was charged with six counts of second degree rape and two counts of second degree sodomy.

hat McNeillâ€™s arraignment is scheduled for March 10 in front of Chilton County Judge Sibley Reynolds. She is currently out on bail.
