Ex-NFL star Aaron Hernandez's fiancée took the stand in his murder trial on Friday as a key witness who was granted immunity after charges she initially lied to a grand jury investigating the case. 

Shayanna Jenkins, 25, was seen entering the Fall River court in Massachusetts on Friday accompanied by her lawyer and wearing her large diamond engagement ring.

She told the jury that Hernandez was intoxicated and had smoked marijuana in the hours before the slaying of her sister's boyfriend, Odin Lloyd. 

Jenkins said she watched her partner leave their home with alleged accomplices, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace, on the night of the June 2013 murder. 

Jenkins also told jurors that she found a handgun in a kitchen 'junk' drawer before the June 17 murder of Lloyd, who was also her sister Shaneah's boyfriend.

When she woke the following morning, her fiancée was not in their bedroom and she did not see him for several hours - but when she did, Hernandez was acting 'normal'.

Shayanna Jenkins was granted immunity by the court in February, which meant she could be compelled to testify or face time behind bars.

Jenkins cannot be charged in connection with Odin Lloyd's murder but can still face perjury charges if she is caught out lying on the stand. 

There had been a question about whether prosecutors would call Jenkins, who has been in a relationship with Hernandez, 25, since high school and is the mother of his two-year-old daughter.

On Friday morning, she told the judge and lawyers during a session without the jury present that she had spoken with Hernandez after she found out about the murder of semiprofessional football player Lloyd.

'I asked him if he did it,' she said. 'He said ''no.'''

Before Jenkins took the stand, Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh announced that a male juror had been dismissed from the case, but she didn't elaborate. 

He is the third juror to be dismissed from the trial. Fifteen jurors remain, and three of those will be alternates chosen randomly after closing arguments. 

She avoided looking at Hernandez as she testified. As she left the stand for recess, she mouthed something to him, and her face looked ashen.  

The 25-year-old took the stand on Friday morning, wearing a long, full pink skirt and black turtleneck sweater.

She appeared confused by some questions and took long pauses as she testified about her actions in the days surrounding Lloyd's murder. Her testimony was peppered with 'don't know' and 'maybes'. 

Fox 25 reported that Shayanna's younger sister, Shaneah Jenkins, who was dating murder victim Odin Lloyd at the time of his death, was also in court on Friday. She sat alongside Odin's mother, Ursula Ward.  

The prosecution asked Shayanna about the sisters' relationship. She struggled to come up with a response, before answering: 'We're estranged.'

Aaron Hernandez nervously watched his fiancée as she gave testimony at his murder trial on Friday

On Friday, Jenkins testified that she had found a black gun in the house in North Attleboro where she had moved with Hernandez and their daughter in late 2012.

'I found it in my junk drawer,' she told Assistant District Attorney William McCauley. 'I don't really remember the size.' 

When she found it, she found Aaron and gave him a 'stern look' - but didn't remember having any conversation about the firearm. Later, the gun was gone.  

It was the only gun she had seen at her home, she said.

Miss Jenkins was then asked if the gun she had seen in the junk drawer was the same as Hernandez was allegedly seen on surveillance camera holding by his basement door. 

Jenkins told the court that she couldn't be sure if her fiancée was holding a gun, as it looked like a 'black blob'. 

Assistant District Attorney William McCauley held up a Glock in the courtroom, and Jenkins said it was similar in color and shape, but she was unsure how it compared in size. 

Jenkins furrowed her brow when the weapon was brought close to her and asked if the gun had been secured. 

Prosecutors earlier accused Jenkins of lying to a grand jury 29 times as it probed Lloyd's murder, including falsely saying she did not know where she had disposed of a box Hernandez asked her to get rid of after the killing. 

She pleaded not guilty to the charges, but acknowledged on Friday she had taken steps to conceal the box.  

On Friday, chief prosecutor McCauley tried to have her reveal her actions based on a cryptic text message that Hernandez sent her about an electronics box, which contained home surveillance tapes, in their basement. Jenkins claimed not have understood his message.  

Prosecutors say she lied to a grand jury investigating the June 17, 2013, killing of Odin Lloyd, 27, who was dating her younger sister, Shaneah.

Lloyd was found shot to death at an industrial park less than a mile from the home that Jenkins and Hernandez share.

The sisters introduced Lloyd and Hernandez in 2012, during a game at Gillette Stadium.

Shayanna Jenkins has been coming to court sporadically and sitting behind Hernandez, whispering 'I love you,' to him and occasionally joking with him.

Here she is seen on her home's surveillance tape carrying a trash bag from inside 

She has not appeared in court since March 6. That day, she was not wearing a large diamond engagement ring that she usually wore.

Meanwhile, Shaneah Jenkins sits with Lloyd's mother and other family members. 

When Shaneah was called to testify earlier in the trial, Shayanna scribbled notes and then passed them to Hernandez's lawyers, occasionally sighing as her sister spoke.

Surveillance video played for the jury showed Shayanna removing from their home a garbage bag with what appeared to be a box inside. 

Prosecutors said before the trial that they believe the box contained the murder weapon, which has never been found. 

Hernandez, who has pleaded not guilty, faces a maximum penalty of life in prison if convicted.  

Hernandez had a $41 million contract with the Patriots. He was dropped from the team after his arrest. His suspected accomplices, Wallace and Ortiz, have also been charged with murder and will be tried separately. They have pleaded not guilty.  

On Friday, police arrested a man who they allege called in a bomb threat that forced the evacuation of the Massachusetts courthouse where Aaron Hernandez's murder trial is being held.

Fall River police on Friday announced the arrest of 55-year-old Paul Haddad of Westwood. 

Haddad was scheduled to be arraigned Friday. It's not known if he has a lawyer who could comment on the accusations.

Police said Thursday's threat had nothing to do with Hernandez, the former New England Patriots player.

Police did not disclose a motive. Westwood and Fall River are about 50 miles apart.

The Fall River Justice Center was evacuated for about an hour on Thursday while the building was searched. Nothing dangerous was found.
