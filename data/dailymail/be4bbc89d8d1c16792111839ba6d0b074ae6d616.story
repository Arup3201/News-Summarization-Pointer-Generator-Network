Jim Bob Duggar is seen giving Ben Seewald permission to propose to daughter Jessa in a clip from tonight's episode of TLC's 19 Kids and Counting.

Ben, 19, is seen  broaching the subject with the family patriarch in Jim Bob's Tontitown, Arkansas, workshop where he is currently employed.

He admits in a voiceover: 'I've been thinking of marrying Jessa for quite a while. We have a lot of the same passions and goals in life. She's like, indescribably amazing.'

Regardless, the teenager seems nervous when he finally gets around to asking the question.

'Since me and Jessa have been spending more time together and gotten closer together, I really believe she's the one that I would like to spend the rest of my life with,' he says.

'I was just wondering if I have your permission to ask Jessa's permission to marry her.'

There is little sympathy from Jim Bob though, who admits he didn't want to make the process too easy for Ben. His reply comes with long pauses and a dose of advice. 

'It's really a big step,' the father-of-19 replies. 

Success! The couple announced their engagement in August and wed last weekend. Tonight's episode will show the moment Ben proposed to Jessa in a surprise scavenger hunt

'You know, I think the most important thing is when a couple can do more for the Lord together than they can apart, [and when] a husband can provide for his wife financially and take care of her.'

But having already welcomed Ben into his home, Jim Bob has been witness to the couple's courtship and growing affection for one another.

'I know Jessa feels the same way about you, Ben,' he says. 'I think y'all make a great couple, and I think the Lord's in this. You have Michelle and I's blessing.'

The relief on Ben's face is clear as he shakes hands with Jim Bob, who adds: 'Jessa knew this was coming sometime but she didn't know exactly when.'

Ben admits: 'I've been thinking of a few ideas so we'll see if I can surprise her - I'll do my best!'

And surprise her he did: the proposal took the form of a scavenger hunt, with each challenge relating to a special moment in their courtship.

Explaining the tradition, Jim Bob's wife, Michelle says: 'It's just understood that they're getting that clearance from the father because Daddy has their heart. And then he's the one who's gonna give that heart away to another man.'

Ben and Jessa's wedding actually took place last Saturday and the ceremony will feature in a future episode of 19 Kids and Counting. 

But unlike her sister Jill, whose televised wedding garnered TLC's highest-ever viewing figures, Jessa did not have her first kiss after the 'I Do's' in front of her wedding guests. 

According to People, they didn't share their first kiss at the ceremony, but rather waited till the reception. 

'They wanted their very first kiss ever to be in private,' Pastor Mike Schadt said. 'It was important to the both of them.' 

The Duggars first entered the spotlight in 2008 on TLC's 17 and Counting, a series that followed the lives of Michelle and Jim Bob and their then 17 - now 19 - children.

They are considered representative of the Quiverfull movement, which 'teaches that children are God's blessing and that husbands and wives should happily welcome every child they are given.' 

19 Kids and Counting airs Tuesdays on TLC at 9/8c
