Anyone who's ever fancied making like the Caped Crusader can now live out their dream in a fully Batman themed hotel room...even if only for three hours.

The Eden Motel in Taiwan has kitted out one of its suites with a Batman double bed, batcave style walls, a Bat-tub and bat TVs and is finding the bat-themed room a real money spinner.

Other rooms in the movie-themed hotel are based on other popular films, with a room dedicated to The Mummy, another based on the famous Alcatraz prison and a third building on the popularity of Sherlock Holmes.

But it is the Batman room which has attracted the most interest, say the hotel's owners.

Miniature gargoyle figurines that look as if they are from Gotham city are just one of the features of the suite, which can be rented for £40 for three hours.

A batsafe, bat mirror... and Batman poster complete the look.

There are a few other rooms also available by the hour - or three hours - for lovers who want a discreet rendezvous.

A 'New York, New York' room, a 'Jazz Style' suite and a 'love suite' covered in hearts are also attracting couples who like the idea of checking into a themed hotel.

Batman fans commenting on the hotel's website have pointed out that there are several different Batman styles in the room, one of which was used by Michael Keaton, while another is closer to Christian Bale's Batman in The Dark Knight Trilogy.

Simply capital: It's not immediately clear why the London-themed room in the Taiwanese hotel is so called...
