He is not the first politician to attempt to 'look cool,' when listening to music and he definitely won't be the last.

But George Osborne has become an unlikely internet hit after a YouTube user flagged up his embarrassing attempt to bob his head along to a rock band.

The chancellor was a guest on the Andrew Marr Show when the presenter introduced British band Keane at the end of the programme.

Nonplussed: George Osborne was a guest on the Andrew Marr Show. As Keane start to play their single, the camera panned to the guests and Mr Osborne looked disinterested

Spotted: When the politician realises the camera is focused on him, he completely changes his body language.

Musical appreciation: George Osborne has now been mocked for 'attempts to look cool' as he listens to Keane

But Mr Osborne is not the only politician to look awkward on the sofa when being played to by musicians on the show.

Nick Clegg is seen engaging in some finger tapping when Brit Award winner Emeli Sandi performed weeks earlier.

In contrast Prime Minister David Cameron is a lot more reserved in his appreciation of the live music as his reaction to singer PJ Harvey shows in a clip from years earlier.

However the funniest video is of the Corrigan Brothers performing their political song 'There’s no-one as Irish as Barack Obama' in 2008.

In the clip, William Hague, who was Shadow Foreign Secretary at the time, and the then Deputy Leader of the Liberal Democrats, Vince Cable, are in stitches on the sofa over the song.

In the past politicians have been left with egg on their face over their public declarations of their favourite music.

In 2010, David Cameron was blasted by The Smiths’ guitarist Johnny Marr for saying he liked the band.

Marr took to Twitter and said: 'David Cameron stop saying that you like The Smiths. No you don’t. I forbid you to like it.'

Similarly former Prime Minister Gordon Brown was left embarrassed when he claimed to be a fan of rock band the Arctic Monkeys but admitted he could not name one of their songs.

As the band start to play their single, Silenced By The Night, the camera panned to the guests.

Originally there is no reaction from Mr Osborne who stared at the group looking nonplussed as these pictures show.

But when the politician realises the camera is focused on him, he completely changes his body language.

In cringe-worthy fashion the Tory MP looks straight at the camera before looking back at the band and bobbing his head in time to the music.

The hilarious attempt to look interested has been mocked on YouTube in a video titled 'The Art of Politics No.1: George Osborne.'

In a humorous text commentary that accompanies the clip, it reads: 'The Andrew Marr Show loves to sign off with a bit of music. In this case Keane, led by their uncanny David Cameron lookalike.

'As the band performs, the show’s other guests watch from the sofa.

'One of this week’s guests was George Osborne. What did George think? Not a rave review.

'But watch his reaction when he realises the camera’s on him. Great recovery.'

The video has already had more than 1,200 hits and provoked some funny comments online.

One wrote: 'The weeping angel of crowd-pleasing.'

Another person said 'I have watched this 3 times and shared it on Facebook...I don't know why this﻿ has tickled me so much!!'
