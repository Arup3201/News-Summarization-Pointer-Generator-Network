Pierce Brosnan's son Dylan has proven that the apple does not fall far from the tree in a new campaign for Saint Laurent.

In the black-and-white images, the 17-year-old strikes a pose in the designer label's suits and tailored menswear, cutting a dapper figure as he emulates his father's smoldering stare.

The handsome teen is not the only celebrity offspring to front the brand. Val Kilmer's son Jack, 19, is also a star of the new campaign by creative director Hedi Slimane.

Like father, like son: Pierce Brosnan's son Dylan, 17, has proven that the apple does not fall far from the tree in a new campaign for Saint Laurent

Good genes: Dylan's parents are Pierce (pictured in 1982) and his wife Keely Shaye Smith, a journalist

Considerably more freckly than his 61-year-old James Bond star father, Dylan is the older son of Pierce and his second wife Keely Shaye Smith, a journalist.

According to Style.com, he was discovered by Mr Slimane last summer in Malibu, where he and his 13-year-old brother Paris live with their parents.

The film student and musician also has a half-brother, Sean, whose mother was Pierce's late first wife Cassandra Harris.

Apart from his good looks, Dylan has also evidently inherited his father's ability to look great in a suit.

Runs in the family: Though his brown hair is longer than his father's, they share the same high cheekbones, piercing stare and bone structure

In one image from the campaign, he looks coyly at the camera in a black suit jacket, black skinny tie and white shirt, his hands resting on his knees.

In another, he displays his impossibly long legs - likely another gift from his 6ft 2in father - in an edgy black leather jacket and skinny jeans.

Though his brown hair is longer than his father's, a photo of Pierce from 1982 shows just how similar they are, with the same high cheekbones, piercing stare and bone structure.

On the horizon: While he has stayed mostly out of the limelight up until now, it seems big things are in store for Dylan, especially after this high-profile campaign

While he has stayed mostly out of the limelight up until now, it seems big things are in store for Dylan, especially after this high-profile campaign. 

It's possible he may go into politics, judging by the internship he did last summer in Washington, D.C.

The teen spent the season interning in the office of Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey.
