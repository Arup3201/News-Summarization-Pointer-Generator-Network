A mother from Phoenix who left her two boys in a hot car while she went to a job interview says it was  'a moment of desperation'.

Shanesha Taylor, 35, avoided prosecution on Friday after agreeing to set aside funds for her children's education and completing parenting programs.

She went on the Today Show with Matt Lauer today and spoke about what lead her to make the difficult decision to leave her 6-month-old and 2-month-old sons in a sweltering car while she went to the interview.

'It was a moment of desperation,' she said after revealing she was in dire financial straits and felt this interview would be crucial in providing for her children down the line.

Made a difficult choice: Shanesa Taylor said that she left her children in a hot car in a 'moment of desperation' due to her dire financial straits

'It was me knowing my family was in 
crisis and knowing that I had to make a choice between providing for my 
children or caring for my children.'

Taylor tells Lauer that she had a sitter lined up but that the babysitter cancelled last minute.

'Flaked on me, is the best way to say it, ‘said Taylor.

Despite receiving criticism for leaving her children in a car, many hearts went out to Taylor who felt bad for her impoverished situation.

After seeing media coverage of Taylor's case, a sympathetic woman from New Jersey helped to start a campaign to collect money for Taylor and her family and managed to raise almost $115,000 which Taylor will put in a trust fund for her children's education.

Taylor couldn't feel more blessed about the deal.

'I think I’ve been treated fairly. The type of resolution I had not many people get so I think it’s an excellent job they did,' she said.

Today asked viewers in an online poll whether or not they were sympathetic to Taylor’s story.

The poll found that a majority of 58 per cent of viewers felt for the mother of two.Prosecutors and a Phoenix woman reached a deal on Friday that would allow her to avoid prosecution for leaving her two young sons alone in a hot car while she was at a job interview.

Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery said his office and 35-year-old Shanesha Taylor have an agreement under which he'll dismiss two felony child abuse charges against her if she meets several conditions.

Those include completing parenting and substance abuse treatment programs and establishing education and child care trust funds for her children.

Authorities arrested Taylor after bystanders in Scottsdale reported seeing her two sons alone in her car in March.

Taylor told police that she wasn't able to find a babysitter for the boys, who were 2 years and 6 months old at the time.

A witness found the infant crying hysterically and sweating profusely as temperatures inside the SUV exceeded 100 degrees.

According to court documents, firefighters found the vehicle's windows rolled down an inch and no running air conditioning to keep the children cool.

Montgomery called the agreement a 'just resolution' that holds Taylor accountable while serving the best interests of her family.

Taylor, who previously pleaded not guilty to the charges, appeared in court on Friday for what had been scheduled as a settlement conference.

Judge Joseph Welty of Maricopa County Superior Court accepted the agreement but warned Taylor that it included an admission that she had endangered her children. That admission could be used against her if the case ends up being prosecuted in the future, the judge said.

Taylor, who spoke little during the proceeding, acknowledged she understood what the judge said.

In May, a court commissioner granted her visits with both children under the supervision of a Child Protective Services worker. She has been able to maintain steady visits since then, Taylor's defense lawyer Benjamin Taylor said. The two are not related.

Shanesha Taylor has used some of the money to secure a new place to live, her lawyer said.
