Ashley Madison, an online dating service for people in relationships and seek affairs, has unveiled a new billboard featuring Hillary Clinton in Chicago.

The billboard includes an image of Clinton holding a finger to her lips, with the caption 'Harder Choices...lead to AshleyMadison.com.' The former Secretary of State has been busy promoting her new book, 'Hard Choices.'

Ashley Madison's tagline is 'Life is Short. Have an Affair,' and its website includes a photo of a woman making the same gesture.

MyFoxChicago, which broke the story, notes that this isn't the first time Ashley Madison has used political figures in advertisements - the company created billboards for President's Day and during the 2012 election.

The President's Day advertisement from last year included the images of Presidents Roosevelt, Kennedy and Clinton with the slogan 'Who said Cheaters Never Prosper? Happy President's Day!'

The 2012 ad featured Mitt Romney, with the words 'If Cheating On Your Taxes Is OK, So Is...Ashley Madison.com.'

In a phone interview with MailOnline, 
Noel Biderman, CEO of Ashley Madison, said Clinton was chosen for the 
billboard because 'this could be the first time a person sitting in the 
Oval Office has survived infidelity [from a partner's affair] and has an 
understanding of infidelity.'

Not the first time around: 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney was also featured in an Ashley Madison ad

Biderman said he wasn't sure if the billboard was 'satirical,' but said it was 'a play on words that allows people to interpret and discuss' infidelity.

If elected president of the United States, Clinton would have 'an opportunity to speak from a unique perspective' on unfaithfulness given her husband's affair with Monica Lewinsky, he said.

Politicians have been featured in Ashley Madison's campaigns, he said, because it shows the 'most celebrated and revered among us don't seem to succeed at being monogamous.'

The advertisement may be coming soon to Philadelphia and New York, he said.

The billboard, however, is not without its critics.

'I
 think Hillary Clinton is an important person in our society and this 
really takes advantage of someone who doesn't deserve it, and there's 
something really shameful about what they're up to,' Sam Chapman, CEO of
 Empower Public Relations, told MyFoxChicago.

A request for comment to Hillary Clinton's office was not immediately returned.
