Former Arsenal manager George Graham believes the Gunners need a whole new spine to their team in order to them to mount a realistic bid for the Premier League title.

Arsene Wenger's side made it two wins on the spin with a convincing 3-0 win against Stoke on Sunday, but still find themselves playing catching up at the top of the table, as they currently lie 13 points off the leaders Chelsea in fifth place.

And Graham doesn't envisage that gap changing anytime soon, unless the north London side invest heavily in their squad - like Chelsea and Manchester City have done - in order to take their game to the next level.

Graham told the Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast show: 'All Arsenal fans would like to see new players right down the middle.

'They need a new goalkeeper, a centre half and a defensive midfielder.

'With all the talent they've got in midfield, they're up there with the top teams in the league, playing attractive football when they're in possession.

'When they don't have the ball, though, there are too many players who don't want to win it back early enough.'
