Prison: Peter Jee has been jailed for two years for engaging in a sex act with a vulnerable woman he knew had mental health difficulties

A married police officer has been jailed for two years for getting a vulnerable woman who had threatened to kill herself to perform a sex act on him. 

Peter Jee 38, who was a Greater Manchester Police sergeant at the time, committed the crime after she dialled 999 and he drove her home.

Jee was one of three officers responding to the call from the confused woman who was threatening to take her own life.

Manchester’s Minshull Street Crown Court was told she had taken a mix of drink and medication and just wanted police to take her home.

Having satisfied themselves that she was in no danger, the officers had left her house in Rochdale.

But Jee returned, minutes later, when he was sure his two colleagues had driven off and got the woman to perform a sex act on him as he fondled her.

He was caught out after making what he thought had been discreet admissions to three colleagues - and from DNA found at the scene.

The court was told that at first he denied he had even gone back to the house, and later claimed his victim had ‘come on’ to him.

After the woman made an official complaint, Jee used police computer equipment to see how close he was to being arrested.

Jee, who is married with children, later sent a text message to a colleague saying: 'I’m going to resign. It’s all my fault.'

Jailing him, Judge Timothy Mort said: 'You went to this address as a serving police officer in uniform, with a very high degree of trust placed in you.

Vulnerable: The woman had dialled 999 and had taken drugs and been drinking before Jee accosted her

'You abused that trust to take advantage of her vulnerability to satisfy your own sexual needs, and you realised that you might be able to get away with it because of your position.'

Jee - who was in the top three per cent in the country in his sergeant’s exams - had been arrested on suspicion of rape, but the Crown later accepted a guilty plea to a charge of misconduct in public office.

His victim was described as having a bi-polar illness, which can make her appear at times elated, or in a low mood. Alcohol complicated her symptoms.

When officers arrived she was drunk, was slurring her words, and couldn’t walk without stumbling.

When asked why she had not made an immediate complaint, she said: 'Who would have believed me?'

His victim told police that the incident had had a significant impact on her life, she suffered panic attacks, and she could no longer trust police officers.

Michael Lavery, defending, said Jee’s greatest shame had been to have been arrested in front of his family. His main concern now was the impact on his children.

Judge Mort added: 'What possessed you to go back to the address I just don’t know. You knew there were problems, and it should have been a clear red traffic light.'

Deputy Chief Constable Ian Hopkins, said: 'Jee’s inexcusable actions let everyone down: those that we protect and those that work selflessly to deliver policing across Greater Manchester. The sentence given sends out a clear message that society expects the highest standards from those who have a duty to protect them.'
