The events of January 5, when England subsided in the equivalent of a session at the SCG, feel like another world now. And yet, when the first Test against Sri Lanka starts on Thursday, it will not take much to return to that indecently hasty afternoon.

At Lord’s on Monday evening, where England’s players and administrators and backroom staff had gathered for their annual pre-Tests shindig, it felt like the first day of term, as nerves jostled for supremacy with natively cautious optimism.

Such dinners are always the perfect occasion for sportsmen: nothing has gone wrong yet (save a limited-overs series defeat or two by Sri Lanka), and the positive thinking of the athlete’s mental make-up can be politely asserted without too much fear of contradiction.

Humiliated: England's players react after their 5-0 whitewash by Australia is confirmed in Sydney

Gearing up: Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews trains at Lord's on Tuesday

When I raised the subject of Kevin Pietersen’s first column in that morning’s Daily Telegraph with a senior member of the England outfit, it was pointed out to me that we had not even finished our starter.

Throw in the idea that England are now entering a new era (despite the fact that there are set to be as many debutants at Lord’s as there were at Sydney), and the only reasonable script is this: Sri Lanka will not prove too indigestible before the five-course banquet against India.

If only it were that simple.

Sri Lanka, as their victories in the one-off Twenty20 match and the five-game one-day series demonstrated, are a serious team.

Their bowling attack looks less of a threat at Test level, but their batting is only ever a 250-run stand between Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene away from taking the initiative in a two-Test series.

Lord’s tends to be pretty flat these days, especially when the sun is out – and Sri Lanka are thrilled not to be here in chilly May.

While the Sri Lankans have been warming up with a four-day game at Northampton, several of the England players will arrive at Lord’s without any serious cricket under their belts since June 3.

And, on their last three visits to St John’s Wood, Sri Lanka have amassed totals of 555 for 8 (in 2002), 537 for 9 (2006) and 479 (2011). Sangakkara would love to join Tillekeratne Dilshan and Jayawardene (as well as coach Marvan Atapattu) on the honours board.

Just as there is business as yet unstarted for England, so there is unfinished business for Sri Lanka.

One former England player in the Long
 Room last night was bullish about his old team’s prospects. ‘We’ll just
 bounce ’em out,’ he said, blithely taking refuge in an old stereotype.

A
 current member of the team confided that the Mankading of Jos Buttler 
by Sachithra Senanayake had leant the Test series ‘a real edge’ – though
 he was less decisive when it came to explaining how many warnings a 
bowler needs to give the non-striker before whipping off the bails.

But none of this could obscure the real question – namely, the extent to which Alastair Cook and Peter Moores have it in them to lead England back to the promised land.

It feels impolite to question this pair before they have really started, but it is reasonable to point out that both men have a point to prove.

Cook will be watched closely for evidence of tactical acumen – for while there is little chance of him being exposed on that score later in the summer by the frighteningly conservative MS Dhoni, there is every chance he will be out-manoeuvred by the Sri Lankans.

Moores, too, must back up his claims that he has learned from the errors he made first time round. He must prove, above all, that he is more than a well-intentioned Mr Motivator. At this stage, he deserves the benefit of the doubt.

England have lost only two Tests out of 13 at home to Sri Lanka, and one of those was on a dustbowl at The Oval in 1998 that felt more like Kandy than Kennington; Muttiah Muralitharan duly put in the performance of his life to take 16 wickets.

Equally, England have never lost the appetite-whetter ever since the Test summer was divided in 2000.

But the one-dayers precede the Tests now, which means tourists are less likely to be caught cold – literally or metaphorically. And Sri Lanka are experts at exploiting a sense of persecution (the querying of Senanayake’s action has done the job this time) for their own advantage.

Forget Mankad. This series was looks tasty enough already.

THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS

Kevin Pietersen thinks he knows why England didn’t give the coaching job to Ashley Giles. It had nothing, apparently, to do with the World Twenty20 defeat by the Netherlands – before which, it was generally agreed, Giles stood a decent chance of replacing Andy Flower on a permanent basis.

No, Kevin Pietersen’s interpretation centres around… Kevin Pietersen! ‘Sadly I think he was just too close to me for the England and Wales Cricket Board’s liking,’ he wrote in the Telegraph. ‘That is the problem. He had spoken too positively about me in Australia for the ECB to give him the job. It is a shame for both sides.’

It’s a wonder, then, that the ECB even bothered to allow Giles his dress rehearsals in the West Indies and Bangladesh before turning him down. Both took place after Australia, which is when Pietersen imagines Giles sealed his own fate.

Lord’s last night offered the chance to watch a brief video summing up England’s year. There was plenty to see of the 3-0 win over Australia, as well as the women’s team back-to-back Ashes wins – fine achievements one and all.

But the treatment of the 5-0 whitewash would have done Stalin proud. All we saw was footage of Stuart Broad’s five-for in the first innings of the series at Brisbane, and a pull shot by Ben Stokes during his century at Perth. Of Mitchell Johnson there was not a peep.

BCCI secretary Sanjay Patel almost seemed to speak with pride when he told the Sports Journalists’ Federation of India last week that his board threatened to form ‘a second ICC of its own’ if their demands for a greater slice of the pie were not meant.

It’s good to have it confirmed that the BCCI continues to take its position as the leaders of the world game seriously.

According to the ICC’s cricket committee, ‘there are a number of bowlers currently employing suspect actions in international cricket, and the ICC’s reporting and testing procedures are not adequately scrutinising these bowlers’.

Until now, the response of some bowlers 
to the accusation that their action simply looks wrong has been to say 
that they have been tested and passed by the ICC. That logic may no 
longer cut the mustard.
