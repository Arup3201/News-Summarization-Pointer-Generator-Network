A U.S. Air Force jet was forced to abort its take-off after it hit a fish as the plane made its way down the runway.

Officials from the MacDill Air Force Base, near Tampa, Florida, have said the Gulfstream G-IV jet was just about to take-off when the collision between the plane and the sheepshead fish occurred.

The crew was forced to abort the take off when they heard a thud after seeing an Osprey fly in front of the aircraft just moments before, Lt. Cmdr. Nicholas Toth, a pilot with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, has said.

The Airfield Management and Operations Wildlife Management was called to look for a bird following the incident in September.

In a report on the MacDill Air Force Base website, Lindsey Garven, 6th Air Mobility Wing Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard contractor, said: 'We swept the runway, but we didn't find any remains of the bird.

'We continued our search and were surprised to find a 9-inch sheepshead lying near the end of the runway.'

Samples of the fish and DNA taken from the aircraft were then sent to a laboratory in Washington D.C. for tests, which confirmed the plane had struck the fish during takeoff.

Toth said at first the crew could not believe the results of the test.

He said: 'There was no way we hit a fish during takeoff. I mean, how does something like that even happen?'

It is believed the Osprey was eating the fish on the runway but dropped it as it flew up into the air after spotting the aircraft approach.

This is not the first time a plane has been known to be affected by a fish strike.

An AP report in April, 1987, claims a midair collision between a jet airliner and a fish delayed an Alaska Airlines flight for about an hour while the plane was inspected for damage.

A mechanic was dispatched to the plane's next stop, in Yakutat, where the plane was inspected, a spokesman for the airlines said.

'They found a greasy spot with some scales, but no damage,' said Paul Bowers, manager of the Juneau airport.

The airport spokesman said the fish had been dropped by a bald eagle, which apparently escaped injury.
