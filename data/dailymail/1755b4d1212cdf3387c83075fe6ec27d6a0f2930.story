Active: Schoolgirl Alex Reid had been a keen skier, netballer and swimmer before she died of an undiagnosed heart condition

A super-fit teenager died in her sleep from an undiagnosed heart condition just days before her parents learned she had gained six A* grades and four As in her GCSEs.

Alex Reid’s parents were given her outstanding results after the 16-year-old died, an inquest heard.

On the day of her death, the part-time model had gone with her mother to buy a dress and jewellery for her school prom. She then baked cupcakes with her younger sister before bedtime.

Alex’s father, a GP, found her body the next morning and fought in vain to save her until paramedics took over and declared her dead.

In a statement read at the hearing in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, Mr Reid, 52, said he realised something was wrong when his daughter was not up at 6.30am as usual.

‘I knocked on the bedroom door expecting her to be up but she was still in bed,’ he said.

‘I shook Alex but there was no response. She was a pale blue colour. I couldn’t feel a pulse and her pupils were dilated.’

He and Mrs Reid, 51, began CPR on their daughter on the bedroom floor while Alex’s sister Jennifer, 15, phoned for an ambulance.

Paramedics arrived at the family’s home near Worksop, Nottinghamshire, but Alex could not be revived.

Her father said: ‘Earlier in the week she had been her usual bright vivacious self and had been to watch her sister in the Olympic torch celebrations in Sheffield.

‘She was extremely popular with her peers at Sheffield High School and was a high achiever. She did not appear to have any problems and had a positive attitude and wanted to go to Newcastle University to study medicine.’

The keen skier was one of the fittest pupils at her independent, all-girls school, had swum for the City of Sheffield Swimming Club and played netball at county level.

Alex had complained of tiredness and indigestion before her death but her parents put it down to exam stress and her sweet tooth.

Tragedy: Part-time model Alex Reid died before she got her GCSE results which were six A*S and four A grades

Just four days before the tragedy on 
June 27 last year, Alex saw her GP and was checked for suspected 
glandular fever before being given a clean bill of health.

The inquest was told she had suffered 
in the past with heartburn and blue lips in cold weather but heart scans
at Sheffield’s Children’s Hospital in 2008 found no problems.

At the inquest, pathologist Dr Marta Cohen said Alex had congenital heart disease.

Her right coronary artery was in an 
abnormal position and fatty deposits had built up in the artery lining, 
reducing the supply of blood to the heart.

Recording a verdict of death by 
natural causes, assistant deputy coroner Mark Beresford said: ‘It’s a 
situation which no parent should ever have to face.

‘She was an intelligent, active  and popular girl who enjoyed a wonderful family life and generally good health.’
