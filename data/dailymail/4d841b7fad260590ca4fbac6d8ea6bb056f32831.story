Centre Court was dressed up for the coronation of Eugenie Bouchard. Genie’s Army whooped as the starlet entered stage left clasping a bouquet of flowers, smiling warmly at her adoring fans. Even Buckingham Palace played their part, dispatching Princess Eugenie, the Canadian starlet’s namesake, to sit just feet behind the baseline in the front row of the Royal Box.

The unwilling participant in this production was Petra Kvitova, who destroyed a helpless Bouchard in a 55-minute exhibition of terrifyingly good tennis

It was the shortest women’s final since 1983 when another Czech, Martina Navratilova, took 54  minutes to beat Andrea Jaeger, an American who has since become a nun.

Bouchard is unlikely to retire to the 
convent just yet, stating afterwards: ‘I will never be satisfied, I want
 to play in many more Grand Slam finals.’

But
 she was no match for Kvitova, who was imperious in winning her second 
Wimbledon title. The world No 6 greeted victory by shutting her eyes 
momentarily, raising both arms towards her player’s box and laying flat 
on the lawn.

Kvitova’s 
ascent to the box to celebrate with her team was as straightforward as 
her victory, facilitated by the introduction of a ‘safety gate’, which 
has removed the iconic scramble over the commentary box and into the 
stands. The emotion of the moment was not diminished for Kvitova or her 
father Jiri who was in floods of tears as he was when she beat Maria 
Sharapova to win her only other Grand Slam title here in 2011.

‘He
 cries a lot actually,’ said Kvitova. ‘It’s nothing new, nothing 
special. Actually I think everyone was crying in my box, he wasn’t only 
one. I was crying, as well. I get that from my dad.

‘He has a birthday tomorrow, so I’m just glad that he has a nice present.’

Unfortunate: Eugenie Bouchard had no answers to Petra Kvitova on Centre Court in two sets

Happy moment: Kvitova made it up into the stands to celebrate with a member of her support

Focused: Kvitova was desperate to land her second Wimbledon title

Easy: Kvitova won the first set 6-3 on Centre Court on Saturday, with the roof open

When
 she woke on Saturday morning, the 24-year-old was greeted by the word 
‘bojd’ - a Czech term meaning ‘come on' - which her coach David Kotyza 
spelled out in kitchen roll on the front garden of the house she is 
staying at in Wimbledon.  

The
 pair remained a professional partnership even as Kvitova struggled to 
recapture the promise she showed three years ago. His charge did not 
require much encouragement yesterday.

She
 broke Bouchard’s serve six times and won seven consecutive games to 
triumph 6-3, 6-0. Using her backhand as a tranquiliser dart and her 
forehand to deliver the fatal blow, Kvitova zapped the belief of the 
talented 20-year-old.

Even 
Kvitova’s movement, normally considered the weak point of her game, was 
superb as she chased down balls even she didn’t expect to reach.

‘I
 think maybe it was magic,’ said Kvitova. ‘A few shots were really 
incredible and I couldn’t believe I was getting there and then playing 
such an amazing shot back. I said to myself “Oh my God this is good. I 
can really run and get everything back.”

‘This
 means maybe more than 2011 because I really played a great tournament 
here. I was ready for every match and I think that I’m more prepared to 
handle the pressure.’

Pressure: 20-year-old Bouchard was playing in her first ever Grand Slam final

Hitting winners: Kvitova was far too strong for the youngster in the first set

Potential: This may not have been Bouchard's year, but many are tipping her to win a Grand Slam soon

Dominant: The Czech star celebrates after winning a point in the first set

The 
majority of the attention before the match had been focused on Bouchard,
 earmarked as ‘the next Maria Sharapova’ and who could potentially rival
 the Russian in both major titles and off-court earnings.

She did not suffer a fit of nerves and even broke Kvitova once in the first set but she admitted to being outplayed.

‘I
 think it’s a tough road to try to become as good as I want to be,’ she 
said, ‘I’m not going to win every single time. I think this was a good 
experience for me, my first Slam final.

‘It
 was a big moment walking out onto Centre Court for a final. You know, I
 have that experience now. I know what it feels like. It was very 
special. It was different. We were holding flowers instead of our  
tennis bags. I just felt so grateful to be able to walk out on a stage 
and, you know, have a chance to perform and do what I love. It was nice 
to have Princess Eugenie there, I’m just sorry I couldn’t have put on a 
better show for her.’

The 
rain began to fall over SW19 just as the final point was concluded. The 
roof was shut on Centre Court and the players were led into the bowels 
of the building as the lawn was prepared for the trophy presentation. 
Bouchard, who won junior Wimbledon just two years ago, was led to the 
engraver’s room.

Support: Eugenie Bouchard was watched by her namesake, Princess Eugenie (pictured), at Wimbledon today

‘I was watching them work, wishing one day, dreaming that he’ll write my name somewhere,’ she said.

‘Maybe
 it’s a bit cruel but I didn’t ask questions. I was in there when I won 
the juniors. So I had flashbacks to that time. At that time I also got a
 picture with the men’s doubles winners which included the British man 
Jonny Marray. I think it’s fascinating.

‘There are some old pictures on the wall. You see these trophies. It’s like nothing else.’

Bouchard,
 who will go into the top 10 in the world for the first time next week, 
will take home £880,000 in prize money and stands to earn much more in 
endorsement deals. But presently her mind is on her living room in 
Montreal.

‘I’m just excited to spend a little time off, you know, with my family back home.

‘I’m
 going to spend a lot of time on my couch. That’s the first goal. I’m 
going to allow myself to have my favourite dessert after dinner.’

For the winner, the Venus Rosewater Dish and for the loser, a chocolate brownie. Sport can be cruel sometimes.
