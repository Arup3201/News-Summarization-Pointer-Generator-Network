For everyone who has ever slammed down their computer mouse in frustration, Apple believes it may have a solution.

A recent patent filed by the Cupertino-based company suggests the firm may be working on a mouse that is more responsive by working like a games controller.

The ‘Force Sensing Mouse’ patent suggests that the mouse would be able to sense exactly how hard and where the user presses down on a button.

It will then respond to the user with its own sensory feedback, such as vibrations, driven by electromagnets or motors, according to Mikey Campbell at Apple Insider.

The result could do away with clumsy drags and double clicks and instead provide a far more controlled way to use a computer.

In practice, the device would mean a user moves the cursor over an icon and presses a button to select it, in the same way that they do now.

But they can choose how hard to press the button to provide different types of commands to the computer, like closing a document.

The mouse could then respond with a vibration to help the user navigate different types of documents.

The patent includes details for left, right and central buttons that would have this sensory feedback capability.

It was first filed in 2013 and credits James E. Wright and Keith J. Hendren as its inventors.

It is not known whether Apple will put a product like this into production, but the patent certainly shows that they may be considering it.

Its current Magic Mouse design is almost five years old. The device replaced the Mighty Mouse after the multi-button device had been on the market for four years.

Apple and Samsung have finally decided to call an end to their four-year battle over patent infringements.

In a joint statement, the two tech giants said they have agreed to drop all suits against each other in countries outside of the US.

However, the companies added they will continue to pursue the existing cases currently going through the American legal system.

Countries where both companies have launched legal action in the past include South Korea, Japan, The Netherlands, Germany, France, Italy and the UK.

Reports of a potential truce began in May, and the claims followed shortly after a jury awarded both companies damages during a high-profile court battle. This was said to have made it easier to resume talks.

The brief statement, sent to journalists by Samsung Electronics Australia said: 'Samsung and Apple have agreed to drop all litigation between the two companies outside the United States.
