Sunderland will face Newcastle in an FA Youth Cup derby after a 3-1 victory over Ipswich Town in the fourth round.

The Black Cats’ under-18s needed extra-time to overcome the Tractor Boys. Victor Gulbrandsen headed the visitors into a first-half lead but Jordan Blinco fired the hosts level before the break.

With the tie seemingly headed for penalties amid heavy snow at the Stadium of Light, substitute Luke Molyneux climaxed a swift counter-attack to give Sunderland the lead.

And Dan Pybus put some gloss on the scoreline before Ethan Robson missed a late chance from the penalty spot to make it four.

They will now take on their North-East rivals in the last 16 after the Magpies beat Middlesbrough 3-2 last week.
