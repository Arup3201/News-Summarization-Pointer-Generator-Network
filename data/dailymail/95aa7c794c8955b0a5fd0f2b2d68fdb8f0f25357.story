Beyonce's bump reveal at the end of her performance at the MTV Video Music Awards sparked a new Twitter record.

As Beyonce finished performing Love On Top at 10:35 p.m. EDT on Sunday night, there were 8,868 tweets per second.

Twitter said that rate was a record for the social media service.

Beyonce's bump rub sparked a Twitter frenzy, with a record-breaking 8,868 tweets being sent out a second at 10:35 pm Sunday night

The cameras skipped between Beyonce and her beaming husband Jay-Z, who was accepting congratulations in the audience, during moments of social media fury

At the end of her performance, Beyonce unbuttoned her sequinned purple blazer to reveal her burgeoning bump, cupping and rubbing her tummy through her maternity tuxedo trousers.

The 29-year-old singer is married to Jay-Z, 41, who was shown in the audience receiving hugs and back slaps from friend Kanye West as his wife's belly made its debut.

The previous record of 7,196 tweets per second was set in July during the end of the Womenâ€™s World Cup final, when the U.S.A. lost a penalty shoot out.

And Beyonce's bump didn't just break Twitter records.

The VMAs drew MTV's biggest audience since the network began measuring its viewership and Sunday night's show attracted 12.4 million viewers.
