The sale of a print of a painting by the Prince of Wales has funded a new kindergarten in one of the most deprived places in the world.

Children’s charity Kids For Kids has used the £32,500 raised by the sale of Prince Charles’s Terrace At Highgrove – gifted to them by the Prince himself – to open the school in Darfur in western Sudan.

The Kids For Kids First Community Kindergarten in the village of Abu Nahla is testimony to the popularity of the heir to the throne’s lithographs. The framed print, personally signed by the Prince, originally sold for £7,500 at a celebrity auction in 2012.

Months later, its new owner, businessman Andrew Mead, sold it to an anonymous sheik in a second charity auction in the Saudi capital of Riyadh for £25,000 – and donated that sum to the charity too. It is thought to be a record price paid for a work of art by the Prince, who never sells his original paintings.

Patricia Parker MBE, chief executive of Kids For Kids, said: ‘It is incredible to think that this new school has come from the proceeds of a single work by the Prince.’

Kids For Kids spent about £22,000 on the new building, which boasts two classrooms and an office for teaching staff. The money has also helped buy other essential items including toys, musical instruments, a roundabout and a slide.

The Prince is thought to be aware of the school, but a Buckingham Palace spokesman declined to comment on how much sales of his prints had raised for charity.

Melanie Gerlis, of trade paper The Art Newspaper, said the value of the print was boosted by its connection to Charles.

She added: ‘It certainly helps that he is a prince and it would help even more should he become King.’

Art critic Brian Sewell said the Prince had a mixed record as an artist, producing both good and bad pieces – mainly because he cannot commit enough time to painting due to his heavy schedule.

‘If he could do it all the time, he wouldn’t produce a bad one,’ Mr Sewell added.
