Ed Balls distanced himself from Ed Miliband yesterday as he warned he would crack down on a controversial form of ‘tax abuse’ used by the Labour leader.

The Shadow Chancellor twice declined to say whether Mr Miliband had acted morally in signing up to the so-called ‘deed of variation’ on his late father’s will that limited potential inheritance tax liability.

Mr Balls vowed that Labour would be ‘the party that will crack down on tax planning.’

He also distanced himself from the Labour leader’s attempt to personalise the row about tax avoidance by branding individual Tory donors ‘dodgy’.

In a further sign of Labour’s difficulties over tax, Mr Balls was embarrassed over a £1.6million donation from shopping channel tycoon John Mills, who gave the money in shares in order to reduce the tax bill.

Mr Balls sheepishly described the donation as ‘tax efficient’, and suggested the tax saved was ‘small beer compared to what the Tories get up to’.

Labour’s credibility on the issue was further rocked by a series of revelations about the tax affairs of other major donors, including businessmen Sir David Garrard and Dale Vince and business adviser Bill Thomas.

'Open question': Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps (left) has challenged Labour leader Ed Miliband (right) to publish the full details of a so-called 'deed of variation'

Mr Miliband, who has positioned himself as a moral arbiter on tax avoidance, came under fire last week over revelations that his family used a deed of variation to limit potential inheritance tax on the family home 20 years ago.

The Labour leader insists that he did not benefit from the arrangement and Labour said it was a ‘straightforward lie’ to suggest he had avoided tax.

Deeds of variation are entirely legal, but were described as ‘tax abuse’ by Gordon Brown when he was Chancellor.

And Mr Balls yesterday ducked questions about whether his leader had acted morally, saying: ‘I think that Ed Miliband paid all the tax which was due.’

Asked whether a Labour review of tax avoidance would examine deeds of variation, Mr Balls told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show: ‘We will look at every area of tax law.’

Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps last night challenged Mr Miliband to publish the full details.

Mr Shapps said: ‘Labour say one thing on tax avoidance, but do another. Last week Ed Miliband criticised the practice, but today Ed Balls has admitted that the party accepts “tax efficient” donations because they “need the money”.

Senior Tories have rejected calls for taxpayer funding of political parties, despite controversy over tax avoidance by wealthy donors.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith (pictured right) said voters do not want to pay for electioneering. 

Conservative chairman Grant Shapps has said state funding of politics is ‘just about the last thing we need’, given the low esteem in which politicians are held by the public.

Last week Nick Clegg called for a review of party funding, to take big money from donors and unions out of politics.

Yesterday he was backed by Tory ex-chancellor Kenneth Clarke, who said the Conservatives must break their dependence on wealthy donors. 

David Cameron should ‘put on his tin hat’ and agree to state funding, regardless of any short-term public backlash, he added.

But Mr Duncan Smith said France and Germany, where parties receive state money, ‘have all sorts of problems’. 

He added that taxpayers will ask ‘Why should I spend more money on politicians … particularly politicians I don’t even support?’

‘There is an open question as to whether Ed Miliband avoided the full inheritance tax liability he owed by using a deed of variation.

‘Now that Ed Balls has said he will look at closing these schemes designed to reduce inheritance tax liabilities, Ed Miliband should publish this document to clear up this matter.’

The deal centres on a £2.4million Georgian terrace house in Primrose Hill. Following the death of Mr Miliband’s father Ralph in 1994, the house was left to his mother Marion.

The family used a deed of variation to alter his will to give Mr Miliband and his brother David 20 per cent of the house each. Experts say this would have limited their potential exposure to inheritance tax.

Mr Miliband sold his share to his brother in 2004, and said he paid capital gains tax on it.

The Labour leader said at the weekend he is ‘not backing down’ in his campaign against tax avoidance but some Labour figures are nervous that the crusade could backfire if it sparks an examination of the tax affairs of big Labour donors and senior Labour politicians.

The tax row erupted last week after a number of political donors were named as having accounts with HSBC’s private bank in Switzerland, which is mired in allegations of tax abuse.

Mr Miliband accused the former Tory treasurer Lord Fink, who was named in the files, of tax avoidance, and suggested he was a ‘dodgy’ donor – a suggestion he later withdrew.

Lord Fink initially threatened to sue, but later acknowledged he had indulged in legal tax avoidance of a modest kind.

Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable told Sky News yesterday that HM Revenue and Customs was still not doing enough to track down and prosecute the ‘big fish’.

Ed Miliband’s bid to make political capital out of the tax avoidance scandal was in free-fall last night, as Labour faced a string of allegations about the tax affairs of its own senior figures. Deputy Political Editor JASON GROVES reports on three donors and close advisers in the spotlight.

Dale Vince

The green energy entrepreneur hit the headlines last week after it was announced he is to donate £250,000 to the Labour Party.

But he was facing questions about his own tax affairs yesterday after it was reported that he has taken a £3.2million interest-free loan from his company Ecotricity.

Tax expert Richard Murphy said the loan, revealed in the firm’s latest accounts, ‘looks to be a tax-avoidance arrangement’.

A spokesman for Mr Vince, who has made a £100million fortune from wind farms, said company tax had been paid on the loan, and that Mr Vince (pictured below) had personally paid income tax on the ‘benefit in kind’.

Sir David Garrard: The property tycoon has an estimated fortune of £100million

Sir David Garrard

The property tycoon, who has an estimated fortune of £100million, has given more than £1.2million to Labour and lent millions more to the party.

Yesterday it was reported that Sir David has had millions of shares in an offshore trust.

When he sold his property firm Minerva in 1995, he transferred 16million shares to a Liechtenstein firm acting on behalf of his family trust, with a further 1.8million shares going to a trust company in Jersey.

Tax advisers say offshore trusts can be used to avoid tax when the shares are later sold on. 

A spokesman for Sir David yesterday said there was ‘no irregularity or impropriety in the conduct of his financial affairs’, and that all his transactions had been conducted ‘in full view’ of the UK’s tax authorities.

Bill Thomas: Labour's 'small business taskforce' chairman shot to prominence earlier this month

Bill Thomas

The former senior executive with an American computer firm is chairman of Labour’s ‘small business taskforce’. 

He shot to prominence earlier this month after Ed Balls struggled in vain to remember his name when the Shadow Chancellor was challenged to identify a single businessman who backs Labour.

Mr Thomas was yesterday reported to be an investor in Invicta Film Partnership – a controversial scheme of a type that is under investigation by HM Revenue and Customs.

Experts claim the schemes operate by funding loss-making films that can be set against tax. 

There is no suggestion Mr Thomas has acted illegally, and it is not known how much he invested.
