Arrested: Nicole Edna Holton, 36, from Upper Darby, was arrested for letting her daughter fight a schoolmate over a dispute about boys

A mother who let her daughter fight with a schoolmate to settle a dispute about boys has been arrested, though she was unrepentant about the alleged crime.

Nicole Edna Holton, 36, from Upper Darby, West Philadelphia, had allegedly arranged the brawl because her daughter’s school wasn’t dealing with the issues she was having, police said.

Superintendent Michael Chitwood said that Holton took her daughter to a parking lot on Friday and watched her fight with another girl.

He told the delcotimes.com: ‘This is apparently an ongoing battle between the two girls about boys. This mom sends a really great message [said sarcastically].

‘She knew they were squabbling and said she was going to take care of it. The woman brought her daughter to the parking lot to commit a crime. One of them could have been seriously injured. This is stupid parenting.’

The fight was broken up by passing officers.

Holton was arrested on charges of disorderly conduct, endangering the welfare of children and two counts of corruption of minors, but argued that she was doing the right thing, according to the affidavit.

She told the police: ‘These girls have been having issues at the school with each other, so I let them handle it. Me and my daughter met her here and I let them handle their problem because the school did not do (expletive).’
