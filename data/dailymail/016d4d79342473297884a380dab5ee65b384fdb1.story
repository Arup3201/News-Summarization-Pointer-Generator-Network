Software company founder John McAfee says he wants to return to the United States and 'settle down to whatever normal life' he can.

McAfee says 'I simply would like to live comfortably day by day, fish, swim, enjoy my declining years.'

The off-beat McAfee answered what he claimed were reporters' questions during a live-stream Internet broadcast from the Guatemalan detention center where he is fighting a government order he be returned to Belize.

Police in neighboring Belize want to 
question McAfee in the fatal shooting of a U.S. expatriate who lived 
near his home on a Belizean island. McAfee has denied involvement in the
killing.

McAfee said Sunday he blacked out and hit his head earlier in the week after not eating and smoking 'almost non-stop.'

Some new insight was revealed about 
the mental state of the millionaire software company founder  as 
he took time to answer questions over his ongoing saga, which he claims 
is caused by corrupt police in Belize who are trying to make him a 
suspect in his neighbor's murder because he refused to pay them a bribe.

'A reporter from Good Morning America
told me on the phone last night that he questioned whether the police 
were really after me. I am serious!!! I have been raided by 42 armed 
soldiers in [my house in] Orange Walk in April. The police raided my 
house eight times in San Pedro, the last time stealing nearly a half 
million dollars in property,' he told The Guardian.

Claiming
not to be paranoid but merely aware of the threats against him, McAfee 
is placing much of the blame on the press and the police, though he 
answered the questions before he was arrested and placed in jail in 
Guatemala.

'I am getting nothing but sympathy 
from the press, from hotel staff, from people in the street (in 
Guatemala). It is the First World press turned upside down. The only 
truly upside-down viewpoint is the First World press, which operates on 
the basis of sensationalism and fear,' he told The Guardian.

The biggest supporters of 67-year-old 
McAfee have come in the form of his 20-year-old girlfriend Sam Vanegas 
and her uncle Telesforo Guerra who is serving as McAfee's lawyer.

'One
of my few talents is the ability to identify uniqueness in human 
traits. Sam is unique. I saw it immediately. Her uniqueness is the 
following – the tougher things get, the cooler she becomes,' he said.

Guerra
filed three separate legal appeals in hopes his client can stay in 
Guatemala, where his political asylum request was rejected.

He told reporters outside the detention center where McAfee is being held that the creator of the McAfee antivirus program is in good health in spite of earlier reports where he said that McAfee suffered two mini heart attacks in the jail.

Guerra said he filed an appeal for a judge to make sure McAfee's physical integrity is protected, an appeal against the asylum denial and a petition with immigration officials to allow his client to stay in this Central American country indefinitely.

Beach house: The home of anti-virus software pioneer John McAfee in San Pedro November. McAfee, 67, has been identified as a 'person of interest' in the killing of 52-year-old Gregory Viant Faull, whose body was found on Sunday

Police in neighboring Belize want to 
question McAfee in the fatal shooting of a U.S. expatriate who lived 
near his home on a Belizean island.

McAfee
has denied involvement in the killing and says Belizean authorities are
persecuting him because he knows about official corruption.

The appeals could take several days to resolve, Guerra said. He added that he could still use several other legal resources but wouldn't give any other details.

Fredy Viana, a spokesman for the Immigration Department, said that before the agency looks into the request to allow McAfee to stay in Guatemala, a judge must first deal with the appeal asking that authorities make sure McAfee's physical integrity is protected.

'We won't look into (allowing him to stay) until the other appeal is resolved,' Viana said. 'The law gives me 30 days to resolve the issue.'

McAfee went on the run last month after Belizean officials tried to question him about the killing of Gregory Viant Faull, who was shot to death in early November.

McAfee acknowledges that his dogs were bothersome and that Faull had complained about them, but denies killing Faull. Faull's home was a couple of houses down from McAfee's compound in Ambergris Caye.

McAfee has led an eccentric life since he sold his stake in the anti-virus software company that is named after him in the early 1990s and moved to Belize about three years ago to lower his taxes.

He told The New York Times in 2009 that he had lost all but $4million of his $100million fortune in the U.S. financial crisis. However, a story on the Gizmodo website quoted him as describing that claim as 'not very accurate at all.'

He has dabbled in yoga, ultra-light aircraft and the production of herbal medications.
