Luis Suarez is in a fight to face England at the World Cup after having surgery on a knee injury on Thursday.

The Liverpool striker’s participation in Brazil was thrown into doubt when he was hurt during a training session with Uruguay in the capital Montevideo on Thursday morning.

Initial fears were that he could be sidelined for months rather than weeks. Uruguay wasted no time sending Suarez for an operation and he had the procedure late in the afternoon.

Hordes of media and fans were gathered
 outside the Medica Uruguaya hospital as a hooded Suarez was escorted 
through in a wheelchair.

Uruguay
 team doctor Alberto Pan is due to hold a press conference on Friday when he
 will provide an update on the injury and the success of the operation.

Liverpool
 have been kept informed and are confident the treatment he is receiving
 is correct. There are no plans to send any club medical staff out to 
oversee his rehabilitation.

Although
 it is unlikely he will be ready to face Costa Rica in Uruguay’s Group D
 opener in Fortaleza on June 14, it is hoped he could face England in 
Sao Paulo five days later.

A
 Uruguay Football Association statement said: ‘Luis Suarez after the 
normal warm-up felt an intense pain in his left knee. An MRI scan 
confirmed partial lesion of the external meniscus.

‘He had an arthroscopy with a partial resection of the meniscus. His participation in the World Cup is not ruled out.’

It
 was also claimed Suarez suffered the injury in the final game of the 
season, when he was tackled by Newcastle’s Paul Dummett. That led 
Uruguay fans to send online death threats to Dummett, who was sent off 
for the challenge but later had the decision rescinded.

Suarez
 is upbeat about his prospects and before entering hospital told El Pais
 newspaper: ‘Take it easy because I’m going to make it (to the World 
Cup) and will work very hard these days to be at 100 per cent and help 
out my team-mates.’

Such
 is Suarez’s importance to Uruguay that local reporters even contacted 
his mother for a diagnosis. She informed them: ‘Everything went well. 
What Luis had wasn’t as serious as we thought. He’s going to play in the
 World Cup.’

Year to remember: Suarez scored an incredible 31 goals in 33 Premier League games last season

The thought
 of missing out on Brazil would leave Suarez distraught and Brendan 
Rodgers once gave an insight into the 27-year-old’s character, saying: 
‘He’d play football all week, all day and night, if he could. He is a 
worker, a grafter and lives for football.’

Had
 Suarez suffered medial ligament damage, as was initially feared, he 
would have been looking at a lay-off of up to 16 weeks. That would have 
made him a doubt for the start of the new Premier League campaign.

Former
 Liverpool striker Fernando Torres suffered meniscus damage during a 
Europa League game in April 2010 before the World Cup in South Africa.

He managed to get himself fit within seven weeks but, arguably, the rush of getting himself back into contention took its toll.
