A politician from Louisiana has admitted just weeks after the Anthony Weiner scandal that he also 'sexted' pictures to a female.

City Councilman Joe Stagni, 47, from Kenner City said that he had an affair with a colleague and sent her the picture of him in his vest.

But the sleazy picture of the father-of-two was forwarded to another female employee before it emerged on the city computer system.

Sex text: Louisiana politician Joe Stagni, 47, admitted sending this lewd picture of him in a vest to a female colleague and having an affair

Stagni made a public confession over 
the picture this week after controversy over similar pictures engulfed 
former U.S. representative Weiner.

Wenier
has been forced to resign as a New York congressman and his marriage to
former Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin has been hanging in the 
balance.

One photo has so far emerged of Stagni that was taken on a mobile phone and sent to a female colleague.

'I
had an inappropriate but consensual relation (sic) with an adult female
and we exchanged improper electronic communications which ended (in) 
2009,' Stagni said in a statement.

The
picture was sent from his personal smartphone with the message dated 
Dec. 23, 2009, and the subject line: 'I'm n trouble - serious 
conversation wwife (sic).'

Apology: Stagni, right, asked for forgiveness from his wife and family, left

Stagni's personal auditor Annamaria Pizzolato is understood to have forwarded the image to the work e-mail account of I.T. manager Danna Morris.

The picture became known after city attorney Keith Conley released it as part of a public records request.

Mr Conley said that once the image had been forwarded it would be 'stuck in the city servers'. No other 'sexted' images were found.

Stagni apologised for his actions in a statement and asked for 'God's mercy and forgiveness' along with that of his wife, Denise, and family.

'I take full responsibility for my irresponsible behaviour. This matter has been a painful experience for my family and I pray that everyone will allow our family to continue to heal. I am sorry,' he added.

Fellow City Council member Brenda Amaya branded Stagni's behavior outrageous.

'It's his own private business, but since he's an elected official, it's not acceptable'

'It's his own private business, but since he's an elected official, it's not acceptable,' she told WDSU news in New Orleans.

Councilwoman Maria DeFrancesch said Stagni’s behavior was 'outrageous and appalling'.

He had a 'disregard' for his family and 'the people of Kenner' and 'this truly gives our city a black eye,' she told Fox 8.

Both Morris and Pizzolato no longer work for the authority but Stagni refused to say who he had the affair with.

But he has not been criticised by the council's two at-large members,

'I'm never going to cast stones on anyone,' Councilwoman Jeannie Black told The Times-Picayune. 'I'm not going to be a judge.'

Councilwoman Michele Branigan said she is more concerned about his family - and 'his wife and children are the only thing' she is thinking about.

'His behavior, I find both outrageous and appalling. This truly gives our city a black eye'

The second political sexting scandal comes after Weiner was forced to resign earlier this month over lewd Twitter messages to a string of attractive young women.

Weiner handed in his resignation letter on June 21, the culmination of a sensational internet sex scandal in which he sent photos of himself to six women online.

White House officials say the House Ethics Committee staff has initiated a preliminary inquiry into Weiner's sexually charged on-line relationships.

President Obama slammed Weiner's actions as 'highly inappropriate'. He said the Democrat has 'embarrassed himself' and his wife and family.

'I had an inappropriate but consensual relation with an adult female and we exchanged improper electronic communications which ended 2009. I did not use any government computer or city issued equipment to send or receive these communications.

'This matter has been a painful experience for my family and I pray that everyone will allow our family to continue to heal'

'I do not know how a communication appeared on any public transmission or equipment. This information was discovered as a result of an unrelated investigation in which I fully cooperated.

'I asked for God's mercy and forgiveness. I apologised to my wife and family and asked for their forgiveness as well. 

'My actions and bad judgement had nothing to do with my duties and responsibilities as a public official. They were private acts, but I take full responsibility for my irresponsible behaviour.

'This matter has been a painful experience for my family and I pray that everyone will allow our family to continue to heal. I am sorry.'
