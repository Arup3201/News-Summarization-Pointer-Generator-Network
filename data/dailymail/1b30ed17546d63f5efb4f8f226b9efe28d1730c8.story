Search teams have found eight more bodies in the wreck of the cruise ship Costa Concordia today.

The body of a five-year-old girl, believed to be Dyana Arlotti, is among those which have been recovered.

Officials say 32 people died in the disaster but so far only 17 bodies had been retrieved before the new announcement.

The
Costa Concordia, a huge floating resort carrying more than 4,200 
passengers and crew, foundered off the Tuscan coast on January 13 after a
rock tore a gash in its side, letting water flood into the engine rooms
and causing the vessel to capsize.    

Work on bringing the other bodies up from one of the sunken decks of the ship was continuing, said the Civil Protection Agency. 

Five-year-old Dyana Arlotti is the youngest victim of the Costa Concordia disaster.

All of the bodies are located near a part of the ship known as Bridge 4.

Authorities
said difficult weather conditions were hampering workers attempting to 
recover the bodies and it was unclear how long the work would take.

Dyana's father William from Rimini, who is divorced from Dyana’s mother, had taken his daughter on the cruise with his current partner as a treat.

After the incident last month, her distraught mother Susy Albertini told of her frantic search for news of her daughter.

‘I’ve made hundreds of calls to my ex-husband’s mobile phone but there is no answer,’ she said.

‘I called all the authorities, the police, the town hall and the fire brigade but no one knows anything.

‘The last time I saw Dyana was on 
Thursday morning. I took her to nursery. Her father picked her up in the
evening. It’s not the first time that she’s gone with her dad on a 
cruise – they both enjoy it. Dyana was happy when she left.

‘They
boarded the ship on Friday in Civitavecchia. I heard from William’s 
parents on Saturday morning that there were problems with the boat.’

Mr Arlotti and his daughter became separated from his partner Michela Maroncelli in the confusion to reach the lifeboats.     

Miss Maroncelli, 32, said: ‘I climbed
into a lifeboat but in the chaos I lost contact with William. I heard 
someone screaming, “Throw him a rope” and I was petrified that they were
talking about him. I didn’t see William or Dyana again.’

Prosecutors are investigating seven more people over the disaster 
including employees of the ship's operator, Costa Crociere, Italian 
media reported.

The ship's captain Francesco Schettino has been blamed for the accident, which occurred when he took the ship close to the shore of the island of Giglio to perform a display manoeuvre known as a 'salute'.         

He faces charges of multiple manslaughter, causing an accident and abandoning ship before the evacuation of all of those on board was complete. A pretrial hearing is due to begin on March 3.              

The new suspects are said to be four of the Concordia's other officers and three employees of Costa Crociere.

Salvage crews are still working on pumping almost 2,400 tonnes of diesel fuel from the vast hulk, which lies partially submerged just metres from the shore of Giglio, a popular holiday island in a maritime reserve off the Tuscan coast.                               

Earlier this week it emerged that traces of cocaine have been found on a hair sample from the captain of the stricken Costa Concordia.

But experts say the discovery does  not prove that Francesco Schettino, charged with abandoning his post  when the cruise ship ran aground  last month, had used the drug.

The cocaine was not found within  the actual fabric of Schettino’s hair  or in his urine – the usual signs that someone ingested the drug.

Stefano Zerbi, representing some of the survivors, described the results as ‘very strange’, saying he believed the samples ‘more than anything else, had been badly preserved and contamination might have resulted’.
