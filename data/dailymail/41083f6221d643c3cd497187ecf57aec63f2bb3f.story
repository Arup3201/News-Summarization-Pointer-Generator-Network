Fashion designer Stella came under fire from fans yesterday after posting a picture on her Instagram page of an emaciated model in a vest from her brand’s Summer 2015 collection, alongside the caption: ‘Worn well!! X Stella.’ 

Hundreds took to the page to express their disapproval, with one writing: ‘Disgusting. That is not worn well, it’s hanging over bones.’ Another added: ‘Appalling image. This young lady is clearly very ill and the body image being used is all that is wrong with the fashion world.’

Stella then removed the image, replacing it with a shot of model Malaika Firth in the same top, and apologising to her fans, calling the original picture 'misleading.'

Comments on the new photograph of Malaika Firth are still focused on the original shot, praising Stella for removing it but also berating her for posting it in the first place   

Furore: Fashion designer Stella McCartney came under fire from fans after posting this picture on her Instagram page of an emaciated model, alongside the caption: 'Worn well!! X Stella'

Fans still seems angry at the designers choice of model, despite her apology 

 A representative from the brand told the Independent: 'We are a house that celebrates all shapes, all sizes, all races and all ages

'We should have been more mindful… It was a quick snap done backstage that was misleading. 

'We listened to our followers and we took it down and replaced it. We can only apologise if we offended anyone.'

The new image seems to have somewhat placated fans of the designer, some of whom even began a campaign to ‘unfollow Stella’ on Instagram. 

Identified as Ji Hye Park, the model, who walked in the show, is stated on her agency’s website to have a 32in bust, 24in waist and 34in hips, which, at 5ft 10in, is extremely slim, but not out of line with hundreds of other models.

Ji was one of the models in the edgy campaign for Rihanna's A/W13 collection for River Island 

Ji is a well established model, having starred in the campaign images for Rihanna’s A/W13 show for River Island alongside Nayasha Kusakina, Milou Van Grossen and Tati Cotliar were styled by Mel Ottenberg and the shoot was personally overseen by the singer.

When contacted by MailOnline, Ji’s model agency Premiere said: ‘She is not too thin. We will not be making further comment'.  

Comments were mixed after Stella changed the shot, which she admits was 'misleading' 

One comment on the picture of Malaika says: 'Much better, but still incredibly disappointed in your first choice of model. Please *think* next time', while another berates 'Considering what a huge influence stella is on young people and as the mother of a young girl I'm appalled at the previous 'model' pic.' 

On Twitter one girl says: 'Let's use anorexia to promote my clothes as a publicity stunt', but then admits 'I do like that top though.' 

 The British designer has also come under fire this week for 'weird' comments about her latest collection after saying strong women 'are not terribly attractive'

McCartney was backstage after showcasing her spring/summer 2015 collection when she said: ‘Strength on its own in a woman is quite aggressive and not terribly attractive all the time.

‘This collection is really celebrating the gentle side.’

Some of McCartney's (left) fans began a campaign to 'unfollow Stella' on Instagram forcing the designer to remove the image and issue an apology 

She drew criticism from feminists after she revealed her latest collection ‘was celebrating the softness of a woman, and her fragility. Strength on its own in a woman is quite aggressive and not terribly attractive at times’.
