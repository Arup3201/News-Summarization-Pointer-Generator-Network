Low-income earners could get 90 per cent of their childcare payments subsidised - including the use of nannies - under a recommended overhaul of Australia's childcare system.

It's a reform mother of three, Rosie Harrison, from Gosford, on the NSW central coast, says is crucial if the government wants more mothers to join the workforce.

Ms Harrison can only afford a nanny once a week but she says a nanny's help is still invaluable in allowing her to juggle her career and raise her three children, sons Aston, two, and Ashur, six, and daughter Milla, five - particularly when one child is sick. On the two days she doesn't have a nanny, her youngest, Aston, is in childcare.

So the draft Productivity Commission report calling for the government to extend subsidies to qualified nannies and other in-home care could give families more options and flexibility, particularly for shift workers, is a reform Ms Harrison would support.

The draft Productivity Commission report into child care on Tuesday recommended the government spend an extra $2 billion a year on supporting working parents.

It's anticipated these changes would enable around 47,000 mothers to return to work.

'Mothers should be encouraged to return to work but no one makes it easy for us,' Ms Harrison said.

'My family would struggle if I wasn't working, but it's also important for me to keep my foot in the door. I need to do it to keep my skills up in the industry, as well as for my mental sanity.

The inquiry recommends government subsidies for families employing nannies for the first time - as long as they meet quality standards.

The per-child payment would be means tested and paid directly to child care providers and cover up to 100 hours per fortnight

There would be a top-up payment for children with extra needs.

Mrs Harrison says a nanny 'is costly but so important' both for herself as a working woman and for her son's needs.

'My son is cared for by people whose sole responsibility is to give him quality care. They do different stimulating activities through the day that I couldn't do with my son. My nanny is only there to have fun and to help him to learn, but when I'm there I need to try keep on top of the washing, cleaning and other household chores.'

Mrs Harrison says the nanny is crucial to helping juggle all three children, especially when they're sick.

'A nanny really helps when one of your children is sick and you need to keep them home, or with school holidays. There's not enough sick leave to support mothers in these situations and missing out on pay for school holidays four times a year isn't an option.'

A study last week found that the current subsidies make it essentially worthless for mothers to return to work, revealing that some mothers only have 1 per cent of their pay left after paying for childcare.

A full-time working mother on $43,000 with two-children will use 99 per cent of her wage to pay for care, the research from the National Centre of Social and Economic Modelling reveals.

The Productivity Commission suggests the government pay 90 per cent of costs for families on less than $60,000 a year and tapering down to 30 per cent for families bringing in more than $300,000.

Families where neither parent works or studies for at least 24 hours a fortnight wouldn't get any payment.

The Commission also recommends the government let au pairs on working holiday visas work for 12 months instead of six. Au pairs still wouldn't attract any government subsidies.

There was broad support for the national quality framework Labor established but it could be tweaked to reduce costs without compromising quality.

The inquiry hopes reforms will encourage 47,000 mothers to return to work

If the federal government takes up the commission's recommendations, the significant changes would affect every childcare user and provider.

But the commission says it's worth it.

The new system would cost the government about $8 billion a year - roughly $1 billion more than childcare assistance costs now.

Many of the 1000-plus submissions to the inquiry suggested redirecting some money from Prime Minister Tony Abbott's planned changes to the paid parental leave scheme.

The commission agrees there may be a case for this, saying it's unclear whether increasing paid parental leave would bring significant additional benefits.

Opposition early childhood spokeswoman Kate Ellis cautioned that if no extra money was put into the system then any expansion to cover nannies would mean cuts to existing services.

Assistant Minister for Education Sussan Ley said she didn't want to pre-empt the commission's final report, due in October.
