A fraudster who stole £130,000 from the taxman by lying about his business expenses has escaped prison because he says his crimes were caused by bipolar disorder.

Andrew Mottershead, an IT consultant, was awarded an income tax rebate after filing fraudulent self-assessment returns in which he exaggerated the size of his expenses.

The 40-year-old spent the money on a sports car with a personalised number plate, golf holidays in Spain and £13,000 worth of jewellery for his wife.

Officials at Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs found out about Mottershead's scam, but did not prosecute him after he promised to repay the £130,000.

However, the fraudster, from Trafford in Greater Manchester, then attempted to steal another £260,000 from the taxman.

Between May 2011 and September last year, he filed five false claims, Manchester Crown Court heard.

Mottershead claimed that he committed his crimes while in the 'manic' phrase of bipolar II disorder, which causes extreme mood swings.

The court heard that he is now being treated at the Priory, a private hospital which is favoured by celebrities.

Bipolar II disorder is a mental illness which manifests itself as a less extreme form of manic depression.

Sufferers tend to go through periods of depression coupled with episodes of 'hypomania', which is similar to mania but less intense.

The symptoms include a lack of energy, suicidal thoughts, overactivity and a loss of inhibition.

The causes of the illness are unknown, but are thought to be genetic and related to abnormal brain structure.

It can be treated by lithium and other antidepressants, but is not curable.

Mottershead pleaded guilty to cheating HMRC, and was given a two-year suspended sentence.

Judge Robert Atherton told the defendant that he was a 'greedy man', but said that he would be lenient because of Mottershead's mental illness.

'Where the balance lies between bipolar disorder and greed is very difficult to assess, and I'm not equipped to do it,' the judge said. 'But I can't ignore the medical condition.'

The court heard that telecoms company ShoreTel, where Mottershead worked for £50,000 a year, has kept the fraudster's job open for him.

Earlier this year, another bipolar sufferer walked free from court after blaming his condition for making him throw a bottle at Usain Bolt during the London Olympics.

Ashley Gill-Webb was convicted of public disorder for harassing the sprinting champion, but was only given a community order after a court heard that he was undergoing psychiatric treatment.
