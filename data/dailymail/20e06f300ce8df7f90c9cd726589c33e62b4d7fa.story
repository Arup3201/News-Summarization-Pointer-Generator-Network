Newcastle United have completed the signing of Monaco striker Emmanuel Riviere for a fee in the region of £6million.

The 24-year-old put the finishing touches to his move at the Magpies’ North Tyneside training base on Wednesday.

Riviere is United’s sixth signing of the
 summer following the arrival of Siem de Jong, Jack Colback, Remy 
Cabella, Ayoze Perez and Daryl Janmaat, although the latter will only be
 officially confirmed once Mathieu Debuchy’s move to Arsenal is 
complete.

Riviere 
scored 10 times for Monaco last season as they finished second to PSG in
 Ligue 1. But with Radamel Falcao, James Rodriguez and Dimitar Berbatov 
ahead of him in the pecking order, the pacey frontman was allowed to 
leave.

Stoke and West Brom had also been tracking the former France Under-21 international.

Riviere said: 'I'm very happy to be here at Newcastle.

'When
 the club spoke to me I said yes immediately. It was an easy decision 
because Newcastle is a big club with great fans and a good stadium.

'My dream was always to play in the Premier League and Newcastle have given me the opportunity to realise that.'

'He is quick, hungry for success and will love having 50,000 Geordies cheering him on and singing his name.

'I am really looking forward to integrating Emmanuel in the group and cannot wait to see him in action for us.'
