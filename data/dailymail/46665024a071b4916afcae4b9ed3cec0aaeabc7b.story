False: Hayley Turner was not abducted by a man with a gun said police in Michigan on Sunday as they close the investigation into her disappearance

Michigan authorities are closing the investigation into 18-year-old Hayley Turner's claim she was abducted along a road and held hostage for 16 hours, saying it never happened.

The Monroe County sheriff's department says a detective and an FBI agent re-interviewed the woman Sunday and 'determined that the incident did not take place.'

The department says it's forwarding a report to the county prosecutor's office for review.

The department says the woman earlier reported being abducted after stopping her car when she saw someone lying along a road Thursday night. The site is in Bedford Township, just north of Ohio.

Ecorse police Cpl. Chris Trevino tells the Detroit Free Press that a driver saw the woman jump from the vehicle in the Detroit suburb Friday afternoon before it sped away.

Earlier this week, southeastern Michigan was relieved when Hayley Turner was found after a 17-hour air and ground search on Thursday.

She was 40 miles from home when she was seen jumping out of a moving vehicle in Ecorse after making a chilling call in which she claimed a man with a gun was approaching her.

According to Click on Detroit, Turner gave the homeowner her mother's cell phone number before the homeowner drove her to the Ecorse Police Department.

Initially police believed Turner may have been abducted when she disappeared after a phone conversations with a friend that was cut off.

Indeed, authorities became worried when they learned that Turner had spent Wednesday going about routine tasks.

She had gone to a local video storeÂ  to rent some movies and spoke to her friend as she headed home around 10pm.

A rental receipt would show that the Notre Dame Academy student had rented Muppets Most Wanted and Divergent.

Employees would later tell the authorities that she was happy and smiling.

Then on her drive home, she told her friend that she had spotted a man lying in a ditch and that she was going to check on him.

'Seconds later, Hayley told her friend "he has a gun" and the phone was disconnected,' Monroe County Sheriff Dale Malone related to reporters at a news conference.

Police now believe this to be false, however, it did not stop a huge search being launched that utilized dogs, helicopters, and even enlisted FBI agents.

Turner's family said the girl had been struggling with some emotional issues this year.
