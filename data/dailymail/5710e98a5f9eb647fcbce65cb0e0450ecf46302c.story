A bizarre video has emerged from China of a game held in Shanghai where people compete to stay still and silent for the longest - the biggest prize being an iPhone 6.

According to reports there were 282 participants involved the weekend before Christmas - sitting together without trying to move, laugh or leave for the bathroom. 

Half the contestants failed to hold for an hour while the winner, a young pre-school teacher called Ms Yan, made it to the end after three hours and six minutes.

Nearly 300 people competed to win an iPhone 6 by trying to stay as still and silent as possible

Some believed the best way to win the competition was to close your eyes and drift off

The game reportedly first came from from South Korea; aiming to encourage the public to release the heavy pressure of living. 

It also took place in another three cities around the country.

Children joined in the game too alongside their parents in an attempt to win Apple's top software

China was expected to be one of the first countries to have the iPhone 6 launched in their country.

However, despite 20 million online orders, Apple's hi-tech product wasn't launched until October 17.

This led to those desperate to purchase the iPhone 6 to turn to the black market: a 128GB iPhone 6 could sell for upwards of £1,600 ($2,440), a mark-up of around £850 on the recommended retail price.
