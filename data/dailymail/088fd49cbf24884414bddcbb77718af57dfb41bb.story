French police investigating the suspected murder of a British expatriate by her French lover have made a DNA breakthrough.

Patricia Wilson, 58, mysteriously vanished from her cottage in the picturesque village of Vabre-Tizac, near Toulouse, last month.   

French police launched a murder investigation after bloodstains were found in the cottage and a  car belonging to Ms Wilson’s gardener, Jean-Louis Cayrou, 50.

He was arrested on suspicion of murder and has been detained in a top-security prison.

This weekend, detectives confirmed that the blood found in Cayrou’s Renault saloon was from the body of Ms Wilson.

The forensic evidence supports prosecutors’ claims that Ms Wilson was killed by Cayrou in her house.

He is believed to have transported the
body in his car and buried or dumped it in one of the many forests and 
lakes that surround the £250,000 cottage in South-West France.

The pair had a relationship that Ms 
Wilson ended a few weeks ago, prompting Cayrou to allegedly 
unsuccessfully try to strangle her.

He is then thought to have planned 
her murder, waiting for her in bushes as she returned from a trip home 
to England on August 17.

Now, detectives hope the DNA tests 
will ‘persuade’ Cayrou to lead them to Ms Wilson’s corpse, which police 
search teams have been  unable to find.

Cayrou has vehemently denied any involvement in the crime since his arrest a week ago.

He is believed to have told prosecutors that the blood in his car was from animals that he hunted.

Deputy prosecutor Patrick Desjardins, 
who is leading the murder inquiry, said: ‘The DNA of the victim has been
identified in some tested blood samples, which means we can confirm all
of the allegations already levelled at Mr Cayrou, and which has already
led to his indictment.’

The DNA was found in ‘items in the car’ rather than on the vehicle itself, said Mr Desjardins.

Police involved in the case have speculated that Cayrou may have used ‘gardening equipment’ to carry out the alleged murder.

Cayrou has been charged with murder, with his trial expected late next year at the earliest.

Ms Wilson, a former advertising 
executive from Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, moved to the 
beautiful, isolated village of Vabre-Tizac five years ago with her 
long-term partner Donald Marcus, 54.

However, the couple’s relationship 
became strained and they  separated after Mr Marcus returned to England 
for an operation last November.

Ms Wilson became romantically involved 
with Cayrou in April this year after employing him to do the gardening 
and odd jobs around the house, according to local residents.

Cayrou moved into her cottage shortly 
afterwards, but it is believed Ms Wilson became frightened of his 
possessive, controlling behaviour.

She threw Cayrou out of the house six 
weeks before her disappearance, but he allegedly broke into the cottage 
to prove that she was not safe alone.
