Esther Rantzen has launched a blistering attack on the Jimmy Savile police inquiry team over its concentration on arresting celebrities.

The ChildLine founder claimed Scotland Yard’s high-profile Operation Yewtree’s focus on the famous could even jeopardise the chances of young abuse victims seeing justice.

She said the £2million investigation – which has seen Jim Davidson, Freddie Starr and Max Clifford among those arrested – was in danger of trivialising and sensationalising child abuse.

Celebrities rounded up by the Metropolitan Police inquiry would forever be tainted even if no charges were ever brought, she said.

Before he became the latest high-profile Yewtree arrest last week, comedian Davidson said the inquiry had become a ‘witch hunt’.

In October, Miss Rantzen took part in the ITV documentary which exposed Savile as a predatory paedophile and memorably admitted: ‘We all blocked our ears to the gossip’ about the shamed star.

But now she has turned on Operation Yewtree, which was set up to examine hundreds of claims of abuse in the wake of the Savile revelations.

In a Sunday newspaper article, she wrote: ‘When Yewtree swoops – and celebrity after celebrity has been targeted by them – we assume they’ve uncovered yet more sexual abuse of children.’

Yet in many cases, she said, the stars were defending themselves against ‘historic’ allegations of sexual abuse brought by women who were in their twenties at the time.

Davidson, publicist Clifford and former Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis have all made clear that the allegations they have been questioned over do not relate to children or to Savile. Each denies any wrongdoing.

Miss Rantzen called on Commander Peter 
Spindler, the officer leading Yewtree, to change the inquiry and avert 
the risk of creating a public backlash.

Jimmy Savile preyed on patients and staff
in a hospice for the terminally ill, it was claimed yesterday.

Scotland
Yard is planning to list all the establishments – including hospitals, 
prisons and schools – where Savile chose his victims over 60 years.

His 
association with Stoke Mandeville, Leeds General Infirmary and Broadmoor
hospitals is well known, but it is thought he may have abused people in
at least seven other institutions.

Yewtree should be split up, with a different codename for allegations which have nothing to do with children or Savile, she said, otherwise victims could be deterred from speaking out.

More than 500 women have come forward with allegations about abuse to Operation Yewtree. Detectives have divided the cases into three categories, the first two linked to Savile, and the third termed ‘Others’ – which have nothing to do with him.

The allegations against Davidson, 59, fall into this third category.

His lawyer Henri Brandman said last week:
‘Two women have made allegations in respect of Jim that date back 
approximately 25 years. The complainants were then in their mid-20s. Jim
vigorously denies the allegations.

‘He answered police questions as fully as he was able after this passage of time. He has not been charged with any offence.’

Eleven weeks after the launch of Operation Yewtree, police have recorded 199 crimes in 17 force areas in which Savile is a suspect, with 31 allegations of rape. Others arrested include Gary Glitter.

First, let me declare my interest. I took part in the notorious ITV programme, Exposure, which broke the news that the late Sir Jimmy Savile, at the time regarded as a national treasure and mourned for his charity work, was in fact a predatory paedophile.

And as president of ChildLine, I am also a trustee of the NSPCC, who actively support the work of Operation Yewtree, the unit set up by the Metropolitan Police to look into allegations of abuse by Savile and others.

So I must stress that my opinions are mine alone, not those of the ITV programme-makers, nor of the NSPCC.

I personally believe that Operation Yewtree needs to change, and change quickly. Otherwise the policeman in charge, Commander Peter Spindler, dedicated to uncovering crime, runs the risk that he will create a backlash instead. Yewtree could make it harder than ever for victims of abuse to ask for help, or gain the justice they deserve.

For the latest arrest of comedian Jim Davidson is deeply confusing. Yewtree is about child abuse, isn’t it? After all, it was set up as a direct result of the Savile revelations. The NSPCC is supporting the Yewtree investigations because it is a charity dedicated to protecting children against abuse. When Yewtree swoops, and celebrity after celebrity has been targeted by them, we assume that they have uncovered yet more sexual abuse of children.  

But it turns out that Jim Davidson has not been accused of abusing any children. He is defending himself against historic accusations brought by two women who were in their twenties at the time. He is of course innocent unless he is proved guilty, and he vigorously denies the accusations. But the danger is that he is now tainted, and will be for ever. And the taint is the false implication that he was somehow involved with the Savile crimes against children.

Exactly why have Operation Yewtree arrested Freddie Starr, and Dave Lee Travis, and Max Clifford, and the others? Nobody has yet been charged; when and if they are, we will be better informed. But in the meantime, all these people have also been tainted. And even if no charges are brought, the damage will have been done, the taint will be there, simply by branding all these arrests with the Yewtree label.

Operation Yewtree should go back to its original purpose, and focus on child abuse. The label should be limited specifically to allegations of the sexual abuse of children, by those who committed their crimes alongside Jimmy Savile. We must discover whether there was a paedophile ring.

We urgently need to know if others over 
the years also escaped justice. Their victims also deserve a voice. We 
need to know the truth, if we are to learn lessons and move forward.

'Exactly why have Operation Yewtree 
arrested Freddie Starr, and Dave Lee Travis, and Max Clifford, and the 
others? Nobody has yet been charged; when and if they are, we will be 
better informed. But in the meantime, all these people have also been 
tainted'

But let’s not label every sexual crime by a celebrity over the past 40 years as Yewtree. All sexual crimes are sickening, whether they are attacks on adult men or women, or on children. I’m not for one moment implying that complaints should not be taken seriously and investigated. Of course not. Just that unless it’s a crime against a child, don’t label it Yewtree.

Commander Peter Spindler, split your unit, and find another operational name for accusations that have nothing to do with children, nor with Savile.

And concentrate on the real question. Why did it take so long for the truth about Savile to emerge? Why was he never tried and convicted for his hundreds of crimes?

The truth is that our legal system is so heavily weighted against children that most sexual abuse cases never reach the courtroom. When children give evidence they are subjected to cross-examination which many children have told me is as painful as the original abuse.

One criminal barrister told me: ‘I don’t care how great a monster my client is, and what it takes to break down a child, it’s my job to do it and I will.’

So you can understand why the police were reluctant to take the cases against Savile to court. No jury in the world, they thought, would believe the word of a vulnerable child against one of the nation’s most skilled and most admired entertainers, knighted for his achievements for charity.

And this is still happening. A few days ago I met a family, furious  and deeply distressed because a number of abused children were prevented from giving evidence, because one was reduced to tears by the cross-examination.

So yet another dangerous abuser got away with his many crimes, and he is still at large.

It would be wonderful if Operation Yewtree resulted in a better, safer world for children. But it would be tragic if the £2million police inquiry simply trivialised and sensationalised the whole operation.

This is not about celebrity headlines. This is about real crimes against real children. The tragic truth is that it is still happening today. And unless we learn the crucial lessons, more children will be forced to suffer in silence.
