Warning: Lord Ashcroft says Labour will oust the Tories if they fail to engage with ethnic minorities in Britain

David Cameron must do more to woo non-white voters or he has no chance of  winning the next election, a former Conservative Party  donor has warned.

In a hard-hitting critique, Lord Ashcroft pointed out that the Tories won just 16 per cent of the non-white vote at the last general election in 2010.

Lord Ashcroft, a former deputy chairman of the party, said: ‘Only 16 per cent of ethnic minority voters supported us at the last election.

‘We must do better than this – both because we should be a party for the whole country, and because we will find it increasingly difficult to win a majority without them.

‘There is no doubt that in 2010 this situation cost us seats.’

Lord Ashcroft released details of a poll showing that ethnic minority voters share the Tory creed that ‘if you work hard, it is possible to be very successful in Britain’.

But when asked which party shares their values, they opt for Labour by a margin of more than two to one.

The survey also shows that 51 per cent of ethnic minority voters have never heard of Enoch Powell, the former Tory Cabinet minister whose 1968 speech implying that immigration to the UK would lead to ‘rivers of blood’ is believed by many Tories to have alienated ethnic minority voters from the party.

Asked whether they agree hard work can bring success, one of Mr Cameron’s core messages, 69 per cent of Asians agree, along with 59 per cent of black voters and 66 per cent of black Africans.

Only voters of black Caribbean origin are tied 50-50.

Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims are more likely than the population as a whole to agree with that statement.

But asked which party shares their values, Asian voters opt for Labour over the Tories by a margin of 62 to 30 per cent and black voters by a margin of 65 per cent to 16. Just 29 per cent of Asians and 22 per cent of black voters think the Conservatives understand minorities.

The poll is not all bad news for Mr Cameron, however.

British Prime Minister David Cameron's visit to India was seen as an attempt to reach out the UK's Indian community

A clear majority of both black and Asian voters believe Mr Cameron and George Osborne’s economic prognosis that borrowing more money now – as Labour wants – ‘will simply make matters worse’.

The Prime Minister led a Cabinet meeting earlier this year at which ministers were urged to reach out to non-white voters in their constituencies.

Mr Cameron and his strategists are keen to target Asian voters on the grounds that they share Tory values of thrift and hard work.

His visit to India in February, during which he visited Amritsar, the holiest site for Sikhs and the scene of the worst massacre in the history of the British empire was designed to show he is taking the non-white community seriously.
