Arrested: Karen Dylan Holt is facing charges over claims that she sex with a 15-year-old boy

A 35-year-old substitute teacher from Alabama has been jailed over claims that she had sex with a 15-year-old student.

Karen Dylan Holt was released on $40,000 bond after the parents of her alleged victim made an official complaint to police on Wednesday.

Holt has been charged with rape, sodomy, and sexual abuse of the boy, who she met while working at his school earlier this year.

Sheriff 
Mike Blakely said the parents came forward after becoming suspicious of 
what they believed to be inappropriate contact between Holt and their 
son.

'They bumped into each other over the summer at Walmart and they began Facebooking each other,' he told WHNT19.

'The
 parents become concerned because of Facebook and the fact that she had 
stopped by the neighborhood and had seen their son Tuesday night.'

Tom Sisk, the Limestone County education superintendent, said Holt has been removed from their list of substitute teachers.

He said that she had worked at the boy's school for only a few days, and had passed all the necessary background checks.
