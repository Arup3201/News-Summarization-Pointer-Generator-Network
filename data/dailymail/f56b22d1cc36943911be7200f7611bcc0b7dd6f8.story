Since the break-up of her short-lived marriage to basketball journeyman Kris Humphries times have been tough for Kim Kardashian.

And her declining popularity looks set to receive a further blow after animal rights group PETA launched a billboard campaign slating the star's love of fur coats.

The Keeping Up With The Kardashians favourite has regularly been spotted wearing such jackets this year, despite already being chastened by the group, who named her their worst dressed person of 2010.

And in the emotive ad the group 
has a cute picture of two fox cubs, with the statement: 'Kim These 
babies miss their mother. Is she on your back.'

In addition to the adverts, he animal rights organisation has also blasted the 31-year-old on their website.

PETA Senior Vice President Lisa Lange said: 'Kim knows that animals on fur farms are beaten, electrocuted, and often skinned alive.

'We've explained it to her, and she's watched a video expose that was filmed inside fur farms.

'When Kim is ready to put an end to 
her relationship with fur, PETA will be happy to take her discards and 
donate them to the homeless.'

Ironically she turned out to support a PETA campaign poster AGAINST fur which featured her sister Khloe earlier this year.

She posed with her sister next to the 2008 Fur? I'd Rather Go Naked picture in 2008, after her younger sibling stripped off for the charity.

It is the second time in recent days the Kardashians have been involved in a fashion flare-up.

It was claimed the Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights had criticised the family for using Chinese sweatshop labour to produce their fashion lines.

However the group's executive director Charles Kernaghan later spoke out to say the allegations could not be proved, that he had been speaking about conditions in the country in general, and that his words had been twisted.

He did speak out again last night to say: 'If Ms. Kardashian has found a way to overcome the iron-fisted repression under which the Chinese workers are forced to toil, then that would be huge news and worthy of tremendous applause.

'But unfortunately, based on our concrete experiences investigating factories in China and elsewhere, the chances are about one in a million that Ms. Kardashian has found a way to push back against the Chinese authorities and guarantee that her employees will be afforded their most basic, internationally recognized workers' rights.'

The Mail Online contacted Kim's representative, but have yet to receive a comment.
