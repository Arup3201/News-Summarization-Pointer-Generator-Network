Fevers were running high today for sports power couple Lindsay Vonn and Tiger Woods - but not for the same reasons.  

Vonn skied into a World Cup victory at Canada's Lake Louise in a triumphant comeback after 22 months of injury. 

It was not all smiles for the champion skier's boyfriend, however: a profusely-sweating Woods vomited twice on the golf course at Florida's Hero World Challenge where he remains in last place.

He summed up the day in a tweet: 'I competed and Linds won'.

The pair recently endured lengthy spells in rehab for injuries which sidelined them from their respective sports for months - and Vonn credits Woods with inspiring her to push through the grueling physiotherapy.

Vonn, 30, has been out of action since tearing her right knee ligament in a high-speed crash in early 2013 which forced her to miss the Sochi Winter Olympic Games.

But she reclaimed her champion reputation on Saturday by leading the American team to an historic one-two-three finish at Lake Louise in Canada.

'I risked a lot more and I skied a lot better,' said Vonn. 'I am extremely happy to be on the top of the podium against and also with my two teammates. It couldn't be a better day.'  

Vonn, who is racing with a brace on her right knee, confessed she was disappointed with her performance in the season-opening slope on Friday, where she finished eighth.

She said: 'I made the adjustment today. I tried to sit lower in my tuck and to be more aggressive in some turns. It paid off. I was just faster all the way down.

'Every day has gotten better here. I'm pushing the limits and I want more speed. I haven't had that yet until today.'

Her ecstatic demeanor was a far cry from her 38-year-old boyfriend's appearance on the third day of play in Windermere, Florida.

Woods has not played since August while he recovered from a back injury.

In last place in the 18-player field, he coughed repeatedly into a towel and vomited along the third fairway, but carried on in his return to competition after an absence of some four months due to back pain.

The 14-time major winner closed with three consecutive birdies to the delight of the large gallery following him at the layout that was his longtime home course.

Working together: Vonn credits Woods with helping her to recover as they went through rehab together

'I wasn't doing too good. But I thought I could hang in there,' Woods whispered to reporters after the round, explaining he had lost his voice.

'I wasn't in pain. I just was a little bit under the weather,' said Woods, who played on Friday after running a 102-degree fever. 

Today marked the 15th career win for Vonn in her event dubbed 'Lake Lindsey'. Vonn won her first race in Lake Louise in December 2004.

She said her experience at the course helped her in conditions made difficult by poor light.

'There's been some changing terrain here over the last couple days,' she said. 'Every day is a little bit different. I tried to pay a little more attention to that because obviously you couldn't see it today. The light was really bad, but I know this course really well.'
