A jury found a Canadian man guilty on Tuesday of killing and dismembering his Chinese lover and mailing the body parts to schools and political parties around Canada.

Luka Magnotta was convicted of first-degree murder in the 2012 slaying of Jun Lin after eight days of jury deliberations. 

He was also convicted on the four other related charges, resulting in life imprisonment.

Magnotta, 32, had pleaded not guilty. While he admitted to the slaying, he sought to be found not criminally responsible by reason of insanity.

His lawyer argued he is schizophrenic and couldn't tell right from wrong at the time of the slaying.

The prosecution countered the crime was both planned and deliberate and that Magnotta's behavior and actions were not those of an insane person.

After the verdict was read, deciding his fate, Magnotta closed his eyes and showed no emotion in the Montreal courtroom, CBC News reports. 

Diran Lin, the victim's father, traveled from China to Montreal to watch the court proceedings from a private room. 

After the verdict, Daniel Urbas, a lawyer, read an impact statement on behalf of the Lin, Yahoo News reports. 

'I had come to see your trial system to see justice done and I leave satisfied that you have not let my son down,' Urbas said in the courtroom, on behalf of Lin.

'I had come to see remorse, to hear some form of apology, and I leave without anything.'

The fate of the killer has attracted much attention with people tweeting from both inside and outside of the courtroom during the eighth and final day of deliberations. 

The case shocked Canadians and quickly gained international notoriety when body parts arrived at offices of Canada's biggest political parties and a video appeared online that prosecutors say shows Magnotta stabbing and having sex with the dismembered corpse.

In May 2012, a package containing a severed foot was found at the headquarters of Canada's ruling Conservative Party. 

That same day, a hand was discovered at a postal facility in a package addressed to the Liberal Party of Canada.

Lin's torso was found in a suitcase at a garbage dump outside Magnotta's apartment building in Montreal. 

About a week later, the missing foot and hand were found mailed to two schools in Vancouver.

Magnotta eventually was arrested in Berlin after an international manhunt.
