Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers should invest in his backroom staff to turn around the club's fortunes claims former Manchester United first-team coach Rene Meulensteen.

The Anfield side are already nine points off unbeaten league leaders Chelsea and have lost their last two Champions League matches.

Meulensteen, who was in charge at Fulham for just two months before being replaced in February, believes Rodgers needs to appoint someone with champions League experience.

'Brendan Rodgers's biggest failure is that he's not invested in his staff,' Meulensteen told BBC Radio 5 live.

Meulensteen coached under Sir Alex Ferguson at Old Trafford between 2008-2013, helping the club to three Premier League titles and a Champions League.

The Dutchman insists Liverpool's return to the Champions League requires a new dimension in Rodgers' coaching set up.

'He has got there because of his philosophy and I rate him for that,' Meulensteen added.

'He has obviously got people around him who he obviously thinks are the right ones.

'But I think he could have done with someone who has been there, seen it and done it.

'Playing in the Premier League and the Champions League, it's a different rhythm that requires a different style of training and a different management strategy through the week. You need to know these things.'
