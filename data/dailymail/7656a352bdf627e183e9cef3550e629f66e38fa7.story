Police are investigating what appears to be a human head found in a Long Island town where two severed arms were discovered about a week ago.

Hempstead police say the head was found at about 5 p.m. Thursday on Boylston Street, close to where the two arms were found dumped on residential lawns.

Authorities are trying to determine if the body parts are linked to the disappearance of Brooklyn mother of four Chinelle Latoya, 27, who was reported missing on July 5, according to police.

Last Wednesday, a Hempstead homeowner discovered a human arm with women's clothing attached to it in his front yard on Webb Avenue according to the New York Daily News.

The very next day, another homeowner found another human arm in their yard about a half-mile away, near Stewart Avenue and Cornell Street.

Police have begun looking into whether the arms are linked to to the discovery of a partially dismembered body in a public parking lot in Bay Shore on Tuesday.

A tattoo found on the body matched one Browne had, police sources said last week.
