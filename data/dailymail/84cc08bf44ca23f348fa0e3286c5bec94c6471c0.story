For years, rescuing cats from trees has been as much a part of a fireman's job as tackling burning buildings.

But cat owners in Scotland will soon be charged £350 if their pet needs rescuing from a tree under a new charging policy for non-emergency call-outs being rolled out by fire chiefs.

The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service is introducing a price list for attending all non-emergency incidents and industrial training events.

It could see drivers involved in crashes facing a fire brigade fee for clearing hazardous roadside spillages.

And homeowners could pay for summoning firemen to pump out flood water or rescue their cat if it is stuck up a tree.

HIRE PER HOUR: Aerial Rescue Pump: £285 Aerial Ladder Platform: £274Pumping Appliance: £262Light Vehicles: £47Fire Crew/Additional Personnel: £24-£39

Other services which will be charged for:

Fire Cover at Special EventsEx-Directory Number for Automatic Fire Alarm Handling CompaniesIndustrial TrainingFreedom of Information requests costing £100 or moreFire Investigation ReportsIncident ReportsTrade Union Commission payroll deductions

They charge £24 an hour for firefighters, crew managers at £27 an hour, and fire engines at £285, all plus VAT.

The current cost is £285 per hour - £342 including VAT - per fire appliance.

Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) said other non-emergency incidents crews attend include freeing people from jammed lifts and gaining entry to premises.

Fire authorities have more freedom to charge after a revision in the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 in February.

Eight regional fire services, which amalgamated to become SFRS on April 1 last year, had their own approach to charging for non-emergency call-outs.

However, a report to the Fire Service 
Board says the new charging policy for the single service enables the 
service to 'explore potential income streams that have had limited 
application in the past'.

The charges are expected to bring in £136,000-a-year.

They are based on the expected actual cost of delivery to the Fire Service, including overheads.

A SFRS spokesman said: 'As a fire and rescue service we are regularly called to assist in animal rescue situations.

'This
 may range from a domestic pet trapped to a major road traffic collision
 involving a transporter carrying cattle and there will always be 
occasions where the specialist skills and equipment of the fire and 
rescue service is needed.

And homeowners could pay for summoning firemen to pump out flood water (stock picture)

'Our
 intervention in these cases can often prevent an escalation of the 
incident and prevent the public from endangering themselves by trying to
 effect a rescue.

'We are 
not aware of any charge being made by SFRS for animal rescues although 
the service would be entitled to do so. Each incident would be 
considered on a case by case basis.'
