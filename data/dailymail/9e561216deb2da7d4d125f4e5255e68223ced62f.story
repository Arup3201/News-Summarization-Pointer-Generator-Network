Finally: A settlement has been reached over the $300 million estate of late heiress, Huguette Clark

The vicious battle over the $300 million estate of late copper heiress Huguette Clark has been settled out of court at the eleventh hour - leaving her faithful nurse with nothing.

The 40-page settlement was signed moments before jury selection was to begin on Tuesday and the judge in Surrogate's Court in Lower Manhattan accepted the deal, ruling out a trial.

Clark, who was the daughter of former
 U.S. Senator William Clark, died aged 104 in May 2011 and 19 of her distant 
relatives have been battling over the fortune ever since. Clark had written two wills in 2005 and the relatives claimed she was not lucid when she wrote the second, which cut them out.

Today's settlement combines elements from the two contradictory wills.

The family - many of whom Clark never even met - came out as the winners, receiving $34 million while her private nurse of 20 years, Hadassah Peri, was left with nothing.

Peri, an immigrant from the Philippines who worked 12 hours a day, seven days a week for Clark as she lived in New York hospitals, had originally been given $30 million in Clark's final will.

Peri had also been given $30 million in gifts throughout Clark's life. A separate deal ordered her to pay $5 million of these back to the estate after the attorney general's office deemed them excessive.

However, the settlement stops Clark's relatives trying to get any more of these gifts, NBC reported.

Cut out: Hadassah Peri worked as Clark's nurse for 20 years and was left $30 million in her final will - but the settlement says that she will now receive none of this and must return $5 million worth of gifts

The gifts included 
multiple Manhattan apartments and a $1.2 million Stradivarius violin. 
Her primary doctor also received cash Christmas presents totaling $500,000, 
among other gifts.

Peri's attorney, Harvey Corn, read a statement after the settlement emerged, reading: 'The Peri family is very happy to 
contribute to the settlement of the litigations involving Madame Clark 
in the hope that it will allow Madame Clark to retain whatever privacy 
that she has left.

'The Peri family was blessed to have met Madame Clark 
and she will always be in their thoughts and prayers.'

The relatives who were arguing for the money are the great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren of Huguette's father from his first marriage.

They do not need to pay legal fees in the case as the estate will cover the $11.5 million cost.

The 40-page settlement that was accepted in Manhattan's Surrogate's Court on Tuesday combines elements from Huguette Clark's two wills from 2005 and includes:

$34.5 million for Clark's relatives - many of whom had never met the heiress

$11.5 million for the relatives' legal fees

$85 million home in Santa Barbara, California and Clark's art collection to be controlled by an arts foundation, the Bellosguardo Foundation, which was set up by the will

$4.5 million cash for the art foundation

$1.7 million doll collection for the art foundation

$3.5 million for Clark's goddaughter, Wanda Styka, who wrote to her throughout her life

$10 million for the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington D.C.

$1 million for the Beth Israel Medical Center, where Clark lived for 20 years

$0 for Hadassah Peri, the private nurse who had originally been in line for $30 million. She must also pay back $5 million in gifts

$0 for Clark's attorney, Wallace Bock, and her accountant, Irving Kamsler, who had been in line for $500,000

The settlement also sets up an arts foundation
that will control the Clark family's $85 million summer home in Santa Barbara, California - making it the will's largest beneficiary, as Clark had wished.

But rather than being set up in California, as she had asked, the foundation will in fact be in New York. Seats are reserved for the
 Santa Barbara community and Clark's relatives.

Her attorney, Wallace Bock, and her accountant, Irving Kamsler, will also get nothing after originally receiving $500,000 in the will and will no longer be executors of her estate, which would have paid each around $3 million, NBC reported.

A criminal investigation of Clark's finances found there was no reason to charge either with a crime but the deal does allow the family to sue the duo, who were suspended from their posts for allegedly wasting her assets, for malpractice.

Others will receive the amount dictated by the final will, including Clark's doctor, Henry Singman, who will receive $100,000, her goddaughter, Wanda Styka, who will receive $3.5 million, and Clark's personal assistant, Chris Sattler, who will receive $500,000.

Tuesday's settlement drew an appeal 
from one group that was cut out of the negotiations, meaning it could 
have to be redrawn, but by accepting it, the judge warded off an 
eight-week trial.

The first 
will drawn up in 2005, when she was 98, left $5 million to her nurse and
 the rest to her relatives. The second, more detailed will, drawn six 
weeks later, cut out her relatives entirely.

The relatives had said that
 a coterie of hospital executives, medical professionals and Clark's 
lawyer and accountant took advantage of their access to the secluded, 
aged heiress to manipulate their way into her millions of dollars.

But the beneficiaries had argued that Clark was simply a generous woman who wanted to help those who helped her.

Clark's
 father, U.S. Sen. William A. Clark, was one of the richest Americans of
 the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He served as a senator from 
Montana, where he initially made his fortune from copper mines.

His
 business empire later grew to include building a Western rail line and 
establishing a Nevada railroad town called Las Vegas. The surrounding 
Clark County is named for him.

Settled: The settlement was accepted by a judge at Manhattan's Surrogate's Court on Tuesday

Clark owned lavish properties 
from New York's Fifth Avenue to the California coast but opted to spend 
her last 20 years in a Manhattan hospital.

While she stayed at the hospital, her
 three fabulous homes sat empty: the $100million Bellosguardo estate, a 
$24million country house in Connecticut and a $100million co-op, the 
largest apartment on Fifth Avenue overlooking Central Park.

When she died two weeks shy of her 105th birthday the only people present at her burial were funeral home employees.
