He is the youngest person to have conquered 100 marathons and holds the world record for being the youngest and fastest person to run 10 marathons in 10 days.

But Adam Holland has added another first to his list of achievements - beating a horse in a 10-mile race.

The 27-year-old won the unusual contest, taking on Tango, a five-year-old 14.2 hands high Appaloosa Welsh Horse.

The pair raced through the Devonshire countryside, taking on moorland and bridleways near Tavistock.

Challenge: Runner Adam Holland, who holds the record for the youngest and fastest person to complete 10 marathons in 10 days, raced a horse Tango, ridden by his owner Kate Melville, over 10 miles, beating his equine challenger by 10 minutes

Owner Kate Melville rode Tango, who she rescued along with another horse four years ago, in the race against Mr Holland, whose running name is Tango.

And despite Tango's four legs, Mr Holland just pipped his equine challenger to the post, winning by 10 minutes.

He said: 'I think I had an advantage on the hills - I’m a very good down hill runner but the horse had to walk down the hills.

'It was good fun. I know Kate enjoyed it too.'

Ahead of the race Dr David Marlin, an expert in equine exercise physiology, said there were many scientific reasons why the outcome would not be as straightforward as people might think.

'In terms of biomechanics, the horse has the advantage because it has four legs. It uses less energy and is more efficient,' he said.

'Of course, not all horses are as good as one another.

'At 27, Adam is at his peak fitness, while the horse is still quite young. Endurance horses usually peak at between eight and ten years old.

'Tango has a better capacity to use oxygen, but with heat production is at a disadvantage, because it is bigger and produces more heat.

'As for Adam, he can manipulate his exercise programme and diet to maximise his energy stores before the race.

'On the course, Adam can maintain a consistent speed, but with the changes in ground condition, the horse will use up energy slowing down for turns and then speeding up again.

'It’s not straightforward, but if I had a bet I would probably put money on the horse.'

The event was to raise money for the Brathay Trust, a charity that works to improve life chances of children and young people.

Scott Umpleby, 48, head of fundraising at the Brathay Trust said: 'Adam is very modest and very understated.

'He has a very unique approach to running and strives on competing.

'He’s very determined, very focused and a natural runner. He has a very efficient and flowing running style. He looks like he’s putting in no effort at all and is always so fresh when he finishes.

'We appreciate all that the runners do, both physically and also with the huge amount of effort they put into the fundraising too.'

Mr Holland is the youngest person to run 100 marathons and also holds the word record for being the youngest and fastest person to run 10 marathons in 10 days.

He now wants to beat his own record for running 10 marathons later this year.

Between Friday, May 9 and Sunday, May 18 he will again run 10 marathons in 10 days, around England’s largest lake - Windermere.

If he can run each marathon in under three hours he will set a new record.

Charity: Mr Holland completed the challenge to raise money for a charity that helps vulnerable young people. He said: 'I think I had an advantage on the hills - I'm a very good down hill runner but the horse had to walk down the hills'
