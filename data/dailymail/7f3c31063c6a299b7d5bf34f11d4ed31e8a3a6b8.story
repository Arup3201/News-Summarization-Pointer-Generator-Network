A 9-year-old New Mexico girl who went missing Friday in a northern California park was found the next day after spending the night in the woods, authorities said.

Ida Rothschild, from Sante Fe, disappeared after she wandered away from her family's campsite was found unharmed by a bicyclist crying for her mother.

The girl was lost for nearly 24 hours before being found by the cyclist. Her father said it was the 'best Father's Day gift ever,' according to KGO.

Two people on mountain bikes who had joined the intensive search for Ida Rothschild of Santa Fe, N.M., located the girl Saturday morning in Samuel P. Taylor State Park after hearing her calls for help from a hillside, according to KTVU.

They heard Rothschild crying and ran to her aide, she wanted her mother.

The good samaritans gave her water and called 911.

The trio waited for about 30 minutes until help arrived.

'She was in good spirits,' a police spokesperson said. 'She said she was hungry.'

Rothschild was soon reunited with her mother.

'Ida, where have you been?' The woman half-jokingly asked as tears of joy and relief streamed down her face.

'Mom, I'm fine,' Ida replied.

The search had as many as 200 people at one point. This time, it had a happy ending.

Rotschild's mother explained to local media that her daughter said she walked all night trying to reach her family and didn't know so many people were looking for her.

'She said she lost track of where she was' the spokesperson said. 'She could no longer see the campground.'

Rothschild was found about 2.5 miles away from the campsite.

More than 100 sheriff's deputies, search and rescue workers from neighboring counties, California Conservation Corps members and volunteers worked through the night looking for the girl.

Divers were also brought in to search the camp's ponds and creeks, according to KTVU, but they thankfully went unused.

'Thank you for saving me, everybody who worked hard to save me,' the grateful girl said. 'Thank you to everybody who looked for me and how much devoted they were.'

The family was visiting the park with her parents and two younger brothers Friday afternoon when she disappeared.

Another hundred had resumed the painstaking search early Saturday, along with search dogs and an airplane.

It was the largest search for a missing person in Marin County in seven years.

Her parents reported her missing after spending 90 minutes looking for her. Her father had last seen her about noon Friday and realized she was gone about half an hour later.

An official spoke glowingly about the positive outcome to throngs gathered at the camp.

'We've had some that ended differently,' he said. 'It's good this had a different outcome.'
