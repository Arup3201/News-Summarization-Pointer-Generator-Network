Claim: Mark Lowry, 46, pictured outside the Old Bailey, was in the process of suing Ocado after he hurt his back delivering shopping when he was allegedly caught painting and decorating

A home shopping delivery driver who was in the process of suing his company for Â£360,000 over a back injury was allegedly caught working as a painter and decorator.

Mark Lowry, 46, claimed to have hurt his back while unloading a crate of wine at an Ocado customer's flat in Chelsea, central London, and said that he was unable to work because he was left in constant pain, a trial at the Old Bailey heard.

But Mr Lowry was caught out when Ocado hired private detectives to check up on him when he launched a lawsuit against the company - and they found him carrying out manual work.

Prosecutor Richard Hearnden said: 'It seemed likely the case was going to settle out of court.

'But before that happened Ocado's insurers hired some private detectives to conduct some covert observations on Mr Lowry and report back to them.

'He was observed to do manual work - lifting, reaching up, bending from the waist and so on.

'The whole lawsuit was exposed as a sham.

'When confronted with his evidence he withdrew it.'

Mr Lowry joined the home shopping firm in 2005 and was based at their depot in Hatfield, Hertfordshire.

He claimed he suffered the injury during a delivery round in October that year, while attempting to remove a heavy crate of wine mistakenly placed on a high shelf in his van.

The weight of the container caused him to lose his balance and fall from the rear of his van, he claimed.

Mr Hearnden said: 'Whether these events actually occurred is open to question.

'There were no eyewitnesses and no ambulance was called.

'In fact, Mr Lowry tried to carry on with his rounds. He should have telephoned his duty manager but he did not because he said he did not have his mobile with him.

'Indeed, Ocado denied there were even any bottles of wine in the order he was supposed to be delivering.

'Even if the accident did happen in precisely the way Mr Lowry described, he used it as an opportunity grossly to exaggerate his symptoms and thereby make a gain for himself.'

He was caught out when the firm hired detectives to follow him for two days in November 2011.

They obtained a business card from 'Mark Lowry Decor' and watched as he carried out work.

Twelve days later, he signed a witness statement claiming: 'I have been unable to work since the accident.'

Mr Lowry claims he only returned to work days before he was caught out

He says his solicitors made an error while drafting his witness statement and he only meant to claim damages up to September 2010.

Mr Lowry, from Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, denies a single count of fraud.

The trial continues.
