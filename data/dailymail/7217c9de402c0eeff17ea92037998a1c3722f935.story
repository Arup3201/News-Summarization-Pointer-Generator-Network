Josie Cunningham last night revealed that she fears her children will follow in her footsteps in being bullied at school, because she has become such a hate figure.

Relatives of the single mother-of-three from Leeds claim she was badly bullied as a teenager, with other children pouring petrol on her, trying to set her on fire and tying washing lines round her neck.

Miss Cunningham sparked anger two years ago after receiving a £4,800 breast enlargement on the NHS, and also hit the headlines when selling tickets to her third child's birth for a total of £30,000.

Worry: Miss Cunningham said she fears her children will be bullied at school like her because of her notoriety

In a documentary on Channel 4 last night, the 24-year-old said: ‘If anyone ever did say anything to my children about me as their mum, I believe my kids will take it on the chin.

‘They’ll have had a lifetime of love and care, and they’ll have been well provided for, and they'll know that as a mum I've done everything I can to be a good mum for them.

‘My children don’t see their dad, so it is important to me that I do provide for them, and it does hurt to think that people might pick on them and things. But kids can get picked on for anything.' 

The mother - who had her third child, Grace, last September, and also has two boys - Harley, seven, and Frankie, three - added: ‘I am a nice person, I’m not a scrounger, I’m not a bad mum.’

And her mother Lisa Cunningham, 50, revealed that Miss Cunningham was bullied at school so badly that it allegedly led to the involvement of a police scenes of crime officer (Soco).

She said: ‘For the first few years of being at high school she was terrorised by other people for having no boobs. She was photographed by a Soco on several occasions. 

'I’ve got a list as long as your arm. I've kept every single document from the police of every incident when she's been attacked, poured petrol on, tried to set her on fire, washing lines round her neck, urinated on, everything.’

Last June Miss Cunningham hit out at a decision to stop her taxpayer-funded taxi trips to take her children to school - state-funded transport estimated to have cost £6,000 a year.

However, Leeds City Council decided to axe the free transport, which she received on health grounds after claiming the stress of unwanted ‘negative attention’ was giving her anxiety attacks.

Media appearances: Miss Cunningham, who lives in Leeds, also appeared on ITV's This Morning yesterday

Last night’s documentary - entitled Josie: The Most Hated Woman in Britain? - also looked at her agent Rob Cooper, with whom she has worked to orchestrate one media storm after another.

Earlier, she told MailOnline: 'Eventually I would like to be in a position where I no longer have to do things in order to stabilise my children's future. For now me and my kids are the priority, and that's all that matters.'

Miss Cunningham first came to prominence in early 2013, when she sold her life story.

The tale, about how she, a single mother on benefits, came to be given a free breast enlargement on the NHS, sparked instant outrage in a Britain just emerging from recession.

She followed that appearance with another, this time on Page 3, which showed off the results of the operation and left little to the imagination.

Revelling in the furore, she then made appearances in which she played on her new-found infamy, most notoriously when she stepped out topless with her nipples covered with NHS-branded tape.

Along with media notoriety, the other result of her going public about her breast enlargement has been a deluge of hate, both online and delivered via Royal Mail.

The documentary offered a snapshot into a life where domestic chores are juggled with headline-generating antics and where every foray onto Twitter results in a barrage of hatred.

It also heard from a 24-year-old salesman from Newcastle named Robin Armstrong, who describes himself as 'Josie's biggest hater’ and posts daily expletive-laden videos of himself ranting about her latest doings.

And in a comment outlining her career ambitions, Miss Cunningham told the documentary: 'Where I want to end up is in every lads' mag with my bangers out.'

Miss Cunningham on This Morning yesterday

Josie Cunningham became a household name when she admitted undergoing £4,800 worth of breast enhancement surgery paid for by the NHS to increase her bust from a 32A to 36DD.

She claimed she needed the surgery because she had been bullied since the age of 14 for being flat chested. 

Later it also emerged that she received Botox on the NHS over a 'sweat problem'.

Miss Cunningham's most controversial outburst came when she publicly considered aborting her unborn child because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother.

The mother of three later said she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school.

The former escort made headlines again when she said she wanted a nose job - funded by the public. She set up a website called fundmynose.co.uk to encourage people to donate towards the £3,000 cosmetic operation.

She claimed she was fed up of people comparing her to The Muppets’ Miss Piggy and said she wanted a brand new nose which is a ‘cross between Michelle Keegan and Jennifer Aniston’.

It came after the wannabe glamour model, who previously worked a stint as a £1,000-a-night escort girl, told female students 'not to worry' if their exam results were not quite what they were hoping for.

Ahead of national A-level exam results being released in August last year, she tweeted: 'Good luck to everyone getting your A-level results today. 

'Girls don't worry if ur results are poor - you can always have a career getting your t**s out or escorting. (Obviously if your over 18!). #Josie'sCareerAdvice'

Towards the end of last year, the controversial wannabe glamour model stepped out with a Girl Power painting sprawled over her heavily pregnant bump, before announcing she would be setting up a trust fund to pay for her daughter's boob job. 

It came after she decided not to abort her unborn baby afterall because she 'wanted a daughter'.

Afterwards, she decided to sell tickets to the live birth of her child. Four tickets to the home birth had sold out in just 14 minutes - netting her £30,000.

It is thought that three of the four tickets were purchased by journalists while the fourth is believed to have been bought by somebody described as 'a super-fan'.

She later said that 50 fans would be able to log on to the video chat service Skype and watch the former prostitute's delivery via videolink.

At one point, Miss Cunningham suggested she would reimburse the NHS for the cost of her controversial breast enhancement surgery. 

Using the hashtag #BritishPublic0JosieCunningham1, Josie said she made the decision because '80% of the country are against' her. However, she later said she had had a change of heart.
