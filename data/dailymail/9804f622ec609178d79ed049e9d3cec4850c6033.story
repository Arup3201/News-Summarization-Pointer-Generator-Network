Thomas Ravenel used his fall from political grace, his federal cocaine conviction and his sordid personal life to become the biggest star of Bravo's hit reality show.

Now, he hopes all of South Carolina will forget the southern-fried mess that made him a national celebrity and vote him into the United States Senate.

The one-time state Treasurer who resigned in disgrace after he was arrested on federal cocaine charges in 2007. His felony conviction bars him from holding state office, but in South Carolina a felon can be elected to Congress.

Ravenel presented about 16,500 signatures
 from registered voters on Monday. If election officials verify the 
signatures, he will be an independent on the November ballot, running against Republican Senator Lindsay Graham.

His biggest supporter: Ravenel, 55, counts his 22-year-old girlfriend, Katheryn Dennis, as a supporter. She is both a 'Southern Charm' costar and the mother his baby

He entered the Election Commission office 
twice at the request of television news crews trying to get the best 
shot of him carrying his paperwork. But he insists his candidacy is 
serious.

The first to cheer on the 51-year-old's run for office is Kathryn Dennis - his 22-year-old girlfriend, 'Southern Charm' costar and the mother of his child.

A pregnancy scare for Dennis was a pivotal event in season one of the hit show. Ravenel accompanied her to her doctor's office for a test - thought at the time, it wasn't clear whether the potential father was Ravenel or another 'Southern Charm' leading man.

When the cameras stopped rolling, Ravenel and Dennis stole away to Florida for a romantic tryst that resulted in Dennis becoming pregnant.

The couple debuted Kensington Calhoun Ravenel at the end of the first season in a surprise flash-forward for viewers.

Ravenel, a millionaire real estate developer, hasn't announced plans to marry Dennis, but the two appear to be together. Dennis has posted dozens of pictures on her social media accounts of Ravenel with his adorable daughter. 

Outside the law: Ravenel has been arrested twice - once in 2007 for possession of cocaine and again last July for drunken driving. Dennis was busted at age 20 for underage drinking and disorderly conduct

Kensington is already a TV star, having debuted on 'Southern Charm' with her parents at the end of the first season

Much of the cast of 'Southern Charm' showed up for Kensington's christening last month

Ravenel isn't the only one with a political past. Dennis' grandfather was a celebrated state legislator and she was romantically linked to a former State Representative (who resigned in disgrace after he was arrested for sexually harassing an ex-girlfriend.) She also claims to be a descendant of America's seventh vice president John C. Calhoun (hence the middle name).

Ravenel was once a rising star in the South Carolina Republican party. He is the son of Arthur Ravenel Jr., a U.S. Congressman, after whom a major bridge in his hometown of Charleston is named. Thomas Ravenel came in third in a 2004 Republican race for U.S. Senate. Today he's being treated as a laughingstock by his former party.

The state GOP released a statement calling his candidacy an 'embarrassment.'

'We doubt many voters will be interested in a convicted felon who renounced his American citizenship,' Matt Orr, state Republican spokesman, told the State newspaper. 

Ravenel wrote on his Facebook page in 2011 that he was going to leave the United States because he was no longer allowed to own a gun because of his felony conviction. He told reporters Monday that the remark was just a joke.

Political past: Dennis claims to be the descendant of former Vice President John C. Calhoun - and is the granddaughter of a former noted state representative.

Ravenel served 10 months in federal prison after being convicted of buying less than 500 grams of cocaine in 2005.

Last July, he was arrested again in the Hamptons in New York - this time for drunken driving.

Dennis seems to share her old boyfriend's penchant for trouble-making. She was arrested in 2012 for underage drinking and disorderly conduct.

Despite Ravenel's popularity, he will not be returning for the second season of 'Southern Charm.'

In a recent interview, Ravenel said he felt a 'duty' to run for Senate.

Ravenel will no doubt revel in showing off his photogenic new family in his campaign ads as he tries to unseat Graham

Political royalty: The Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge is named after Thomas Ravenel's father, a U.S. Congressman who secured support to build the $700million span outside Charleston

'I just felt I wasn't hearing from the current crop of politicians anything that could save the country. And so - I know I'm an imperfect messenger - but I just think my message was better than the other guys,' he said.

He is campaigning on a platform of several Tea Party favorite positions, including ending trade restrictions, lowering taxes, scaling back the powers of government and and 'returning to the Constitution.'

'I'm a student of history, student of the founding documents - the Constitution, the state constitutions, the Articles of Confederation. I take seriously the Declaration of Independence,' he said.
