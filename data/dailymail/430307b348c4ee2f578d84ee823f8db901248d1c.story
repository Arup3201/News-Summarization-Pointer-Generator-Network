Imran Hussain, 32, is already serving a 14-and-a-half-year sentence for drug smuggling and dealing

An international drug smuggler who is already serving a 14 year sentence for hiding £800,000 of heroin in children's clothing has been order to pay up more than £70,000 or face longer behind bars. 

Imran Hussain, 32, from Birmingham, had made £285,781 from drug smuggling and dealing when he was convicted in August, 2013.

He has now been ordered to repay  his ill-gotten gains or spend a further 21 months in prison.

Birmingham Crown Court heard Hussain's realisable assets, including cash and the price of an industrial unit, came to £76,693.

His Honour Judge Murray Creed gave Hussain six months to come up with the cash.

He said: 'You have a criminal lifestyle by reason of the convictions the jury returned.

'I declare the realisable assets are £76,693 and I make a confiscation order in that amount which is to be paid by February 2, 2015.'

Hussain denied importing heroin and possession with intent to supply but was convicted by a jury last August and handed a 14-and-a-half-year sentence.

His operation was rumbled when police became suspicious about a Luton taxi making a delivery in Birmingham.

When the vehicle was stopped, officers found four-and-a-half kilos of heroin with a street value of more than £800,000 concealed in the lining of children's tracksuits and jackets.

Telephone analysis revealed the delivery was bound for Hussain.

During a raid on his home, police found scales and a mobile phone - both covered in heroin - as well as an ounce of the Class A drug.

Det Insp Martin Brennan, from the serious and organised crime unit, said: 'This seizure and the conviction has stopped a large quantity of heroin from being dealt on the streets of Birmingham.

'The arrest is a fantastic example of how local officers work closely alongside force detectives to speedily take action against those trying to bring Class A drugs into the West Midlands.

'Smugglers continue to try more sophisticated ways of concealing drugs to get them into this country, but we are one step ahead.

'We have dedicated teams working around the clock to track down those people who try to do this and bring them to justice.'
