The Wall Street Journal said on Thursday that the company's computer system had been accessed by Chinese hackers.

The revelation comes in the wake of news that the New York Times was also targeted by Chinese hackers, who the company believes tried to monitor the paper's coverage of Chinese premier Wen Jiabao.

The hackers who infiltrated The Wall Street Journal's system were similarly trying to gain information about reporting activity and sources being used for the paper's China coverage.

Security alert: The Wall Street Journal announced its computer system had been infiltrated by suspected Chinese hackers

Breach: Sources say the breach likely came through the paper's Beijing bureau, that operates its Chinese language website

'The infiltration of computer 
networks related to coverage of China is an ongoing issue,' according to
a statement released on Thursday from Dow Jones, the News Corp. unit 
that owns The Journal. 

'Today
we finished a complete overhaul of our systems designed to strengthen 
our networks. We fully intend to continue the aggressive and independent
journalism for which we are known,' the statement added.

No details were provided from the company about how the hackers gained access to the computer system.

Less than thrilled: The Chinese government allegedly began targeting the New York Times after the paper began investigating the fortune of Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, pictured in Beijing in March 2012

On Wednesday, the New York Times revealed in a Times story that the paper had been infiltrated by Chinese hackers over the course of four months while reporters investigated a story about the wealth amassed by the 
family of the top Chinese leader Wen Jiabao.

The Times alleges that the hackers attacked the Times’ computer 
system and stole employee passwords after reporters began investigating Wen Jiabao’s massive fortune, estimated to be valued at more than $2 billion.

The security breaches began in September, the same time that the paper began its investigation.

The infiltrators were reportedly trying to track down 
files relating to Prime Minister Wen and his family's impressive 
wealth.

The paper's executive editor Jill Abramson said they found 'no evidence that sensitive e-mails or 
files from the reporting of our articles about the Wen family were 
accessed, downloaded or copied.'

Security experts 
hired by the New York paper to deal with the security breaches found that the hackers routed 
the attacks through computers at U.S. universities, installed a strain 
of malicious software associated with Chinese hackers and initiated the 
attacks from university computers previously used to attack U.S. 
military contractors.

The Chinese government had previously threatened to retaliate against the Times for the damaging report.

The government blocked both the Chinese and English websites in the country after an article in October was published regarding Wen Jiabao's fortune.

Searches for 
the publication's site as well as the names of Mr Wen's family members 
were also barred on the country's main microblog service with the 
Chinese government describing the feature as a 'smear.'

Response: The Wall Street Journal said they are taking taking extensive measures to protect customers, employees, journalists and sources after the security breach (pictured the WSJ newsroom in Manhattan)

The Chinese premier is thought to have been very embarrassed by the story.

'Some reports smear China and have ulterior motives,' Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said at the time.'

Executives 
had become concerned about security when Chinese officials warned them 
of unspecified consequences before they published their investigation 
into Wen Jiabao on October 25.

The
article stated that the family of Mr Wen, 70, known for his humble 
background - his mother was a teacher and his father tended pigs - had 
accumulated most of their assets since Wen was named vice premier in 
1998 before his promotion to Prime Minister nine years ago.

The estimate of his family's wealth was made according to a review of corporate and regulatory records from 1992 to 2012.

New
York Times reporter Chris Buckley was forced to leave the country 
following the article after authorities failed to renew his medical 
documentation.
