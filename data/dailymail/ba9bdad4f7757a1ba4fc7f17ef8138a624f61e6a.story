It's like the plot from a heart-warming family movie.

Seven months after Leanda Loosemore’s dog Annah was stolen, she was found bedraggled but unharmed, 500 miles from where she’d disappeared.

After the show dog was kidnapped from outside her home in Newburgh, Scotland, Miss Loosemore spent months appealing on the internet to try to trace her  Shetland sheepdog.

But she had given up all hope of ever seeing the dog again when a call came from Kent, saying Annah was safe, well and ready to come home.

The incredible reunion took place because Annah had been fitted with a pet microchip containing her owner’s details.

Rather than have Miss Loosemore, 25, travel all the way to Kent, staff at the rescue centre that were caring for Annah agreed to meet her in the Midlands – at a dog show she was attending in Birmingham.

The hand-over took place around ten days later, shortly before Christmas. It was a moment the mother of two will never forget.

She said: ‘I was doing my best not to cry, but it was amazing. It was a massive, massive relief when I  actually got my hands on her and picked her up.

‘I had been putting stuff on Facebook for months, but I had given up about six weeks before that. I thought: That’s it. I am not going to get her back now.

‘So it was unbelievable when I heard she had been found.’

The six-year-old bitch was on a lead outside her home near Newburgh, close to St Andrews in Fife, when thieves crept in through a broken fence and took her.

Annah, whose pups sell for up to £800, was next seen 521 miles away, wandering the outskirts of Ashford, Kent.

She was picked up by council workers and taken to the local dog pound, where she was traced back to Fife through her microchip.

Miss Loosemore believes Annah was stolen for breeding purposes and cast aside by the thieves when the plan wasn’t successful, or  perhaps that she escaped from new owners who had bought her from the dognappers.

Although she was dirty when picked up and her fur was matted, Annah was still healthy and had been properly cared for during her seven months of captivity. She had even put on weight.

‘Whoever had her did look after her. She’s not nervous or scared of anything, it’s as if she has never been away. She’s back to her usual happy self.’

Miss Loosemore, who is a trainee beautician with children aged three and five, has nine show dogs in total, including Annah’s sons and brother, but it is Annah who has been the household’s favourite this Christmas.

‘The kids were really excited to get Annah back. On the whole they love each dog equally but because of the hype of her going away and coming back it’s Annah they want all the time.

‘They are really happy to have her back.’

Mark James, a spokesman for Ashford council, said Annah was taken in after being spotted by a builder in a field.

He added: ‘We are pleased that there was a happy outcome to this story and that Annah is now safe and enjoying home comforts once again.’
