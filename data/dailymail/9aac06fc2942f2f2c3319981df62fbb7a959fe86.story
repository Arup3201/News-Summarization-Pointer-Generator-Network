This is the moment two jobsworth parking wardens issued a driver with a ticket after his car broke down in the middle of a busy road.

Passers-by watched in disbelief as wardens from Brighton and Hove City Council, East Sussex, slapped a ticket on the silver saloon car's windscreen after the driver left to fetch help.

Trainee midwife Estelle Francis, 33, who photographed the incident, said: 'I was walking by and thought the two men were police.

'But then I saw them putting a ticket on the windscreen.

'I couldn't believe it. It was clear the driver had broken down, the hazard lights were on.

'Instead of calling the police or making sure the area was safe they seemed more concerned with handing out the parking ticket.

'Cars were still going by at quite a speed. It was dangerous.

'I just thought this really takes the biscuit. I've never seen anything like it.'

The car, believed to be a VW Passat, was ticketed while broken down on a busy road in Brighton city centre. A child seat was visible in the vehicle.

Brighton and Hove City Council has been criticised in recent years for the amount of money it makes from parking.

In December last year it was revealed that the council's overall profit from parking services for 2012/13 was £16.3million - the most of any local authority outside London.

The council said it was unable to comment on yesterday's incident.

'We don't provide commentary on individual cases,' said a spokesman.

'The driver is well within their rights to make a case for appeal. That will be considered in time.

'However it would be unfair for us to comment beforehand.'
