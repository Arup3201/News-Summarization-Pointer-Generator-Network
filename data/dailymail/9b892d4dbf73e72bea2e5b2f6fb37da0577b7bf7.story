The billionaire co-owner of the Marx candy empire avoided jail on Thursday after she pleaded guilty to misdemeanor reckless driving in connection with a fatal accident in which a grandmother and an unborn baby were killed.

Jacqueline Badger Mars, 74, had her driving license suspended for six months and was ordered to pay a $2,500 fine during a hearing in Loudoun County General District Court, Virginia.

The judge could have sentenced Mars to a year on the misdemeanor charge; however, the family of victim Irene Ellisor asked the judge not to throw Mars in jail.

Mars was driving
 her Porsche SUV in Loudoun County on October 4 when she 
crossed the center line on Route 50 and slammed into a Chrysler minivan.

A
 backseat passenger in the minivan - 86-year-old 
grandmother Irene Ellisor, of Huntsville, Texas - was pronounced dead at 
the scene. 

The minivan's driver, Ashley 
Blakeslee, was eight months pregnant. Her unborn child, Charlie, died.

Court papers say Mars told a witness she fell asleep just before the October crash.

General District Judge Deborah Welsh, who called the crash 'horrible,' could have sentenced Mars to up to a year in jail on the misdemeanor charge.

But the victim's relatives asked the judge not to incarcerate her, saying they have forgiven Mars.

Prosecutors did not seek jail time, 
but left it to the judge's discretion and asked the judge to take the 
family's wishes into account.

Mars, who had a perfect driving record and tests showed no alcohol or drugs in her system, apologized for the crash and said she will live with grief for the rest of her life.

When Mars received her court summons in 
October, a personal spokesperson for her said: 'Jackie’s thoughts 
and prayers remain with 
those who have suffered injury and loss. She regrets this tragic 
accident.'

Mars is one of the richest people in the world with a net worth estimated at $20.5billion and is a resident of The Plains, Virginia.

According to investigators, Mars, the 
granddaughter of the founder of the Mars, Inc, candy, food and beverage 
giant, was going westbound on Route 50 just before 2.30pm when she 
reportedly veered across the double yellow line near Briar Patch Lane, 
colliding head-on with the Chrysler minivan carrying six women.

The victim, Irene Ellisor, was reportedly not wearing a seat belt at the time of the crash. The other five occupants of the vehicle were hospitalized, among them the driver who was listed in serious condition.

Mars was rushed to Stone Springs Medical Center and later transferred to Inova Fairfax Hospital, where she was treated for her injuries and released.

Ellisor and her companions had traveled to Virginia from Texas to attend the wedding of a relative, which was on the day of the crash.

Ambitious innovator: Mars was founded in 1911 by Jacqueline Mars' grandfather, Frank Mars, who started his business by making chocolates in his Tacoma, Washington, kitchen

Jacqueline Mars and her two brothers, 
John and Forrest Jr., own Mars - the largest candy maker in the world 
with $33billion in sales.

All three are on the board of directors but are not involved in the day-to-day operations of the corporation. 

The three siblings inherited the company in 1999 after the death of their father.

Jacqueline Mars was ranked by Forbes Magazine in September as the 15th wealthiest person - 7th richest woman - in the world boasting a net worth upward of $20billion.

Mars was founded in 1911 by Jacqueline
 Mars' grandfather, Frank Mars, who got his business off the ground by making 
chocolates in his Tacoma, Washington, kitchen.

In 1929, the company invented the signature malt-flavored nougat, which became the filing of Milky Way and Snickers candy bars.

The sweets manufacturer is also makes M&Ms, over 400 million of which are produced in the U.S. each day.

Besides sugary treats, Mars’ extensive portfolio includes Uncle Ben's rice and pet food brands Pedigree and Whiskas.
