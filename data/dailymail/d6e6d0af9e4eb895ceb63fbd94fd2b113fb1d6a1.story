As Luis Suarez celebrated the goals that vanquished England on Thursday evening, the eagle-eyed among you may have noticed that the Uruguay crest on his shirt has four gold stars above it.

Surely that can’t be right? We all know that Uruguay have only won the World Cup on two occasions, so surely they’ve stitched on a couple more on without really being entitled to them?

After all, in FIFA’s equipment regulations, section 18.2 states: ‘Those Member Associations that have won the FIFA World Cup may put a symbol on the playing shirt representing this accomplishment and the number of times won.’

Too many stars? The crest on Luis Suarez's shirt is adorned by four stars despite Uruguay only winning the World Cup twice

And all the other nations have the correct amount - Brazil, of course, have their five stars; Italy have four; Germany three; Argentina two and England, France and Spain one apiece.

It turns out that Uruguay’s badge is a bit of an anomaly, but not an unjustified one.

Yes, they did win the World Cup in 1930 and 1950, as we all know, but they were twice world champions before that competition had even got off the ground.

That’s because the Olympic Games - won by Uruguay in 1924 and 1928 - were officially recognised as the FIFA world championships before the World Cup as we now know it was founded in 1930.

Back in 1914, Jules Rimet, the third President of the governing body and the man after whom the first World Cup trophy was named, declared: ‘Under the condition that the Olympic Football tournament be organized in agreement with FIFA rules, this competition will be recognised as a FIFA World Championship.’

History lesson: Uruguay are allowed an extra two stars because they won they won the Olympic Games in 1924 and 1928

Their first effort to organise this in 1920 ended in farce when Czechoslovakia walked off the field in protest in the final against Belgium, but they had greater luck four years later in Paris.

With more and more amateur players starting to turn professional, FIFA exploited a loophole in the rules of the strictly-amateur Olympic Movement so the best teams in the world could compete.

The players would take part and technically be considered ‘amateurs’ by the International Olympic Committee as long as their own country’s Football Association compensated them for missing work.

The Official History of FIFA states that the winners of these tournaments in 1924 and 1928 were therefore considered the official world champions.

Uruguay were the best on the planet at the time and racked up 17 goals in four matches on their way to the gold medal match, where Switzerland were rolled over 3-0.

Big difference: Uruguay's crest (left) includes four stars, while England (right) can only boast one from 1966

Four years later, in Amsterdam, they defeated neighbours Argentina in a replay to make it back-to-back wins and secure a second gold star.

The Olympic tournaments proved that a world football championship could be successfully staged and Jules Rimet soon moved to a grander vision - the World Cup.

Uruguay proved quite good at that too, beating Argentina 4-2 in the 1930 final, and then stunning Brazil in the Maracana in 1950.

So when FIFA revised its constitution in 1950, they formally recognised that Uruguay were four-time world champions. The badge, they will definitely feel, has been stuck with four stars for far too long.

Dozens of clubs around the world incorporate stars into their crests to represent achievements. 

Proud: Nottingham Forest (left) and Aston Villa (right) are among the clubs to include stars on their shirts

Egypt, for example, can wear seven stars for each of their Africa Cup of Nations victories; Cameroon and Ghana wear four, while Zambia proudly marked their maiden win in 2012 with the symbol. Japan have a commemorative shirt with four stars for their Asian Cup triumphs.

In England, Nottingham Forest wear two stars above their crest to mark back-to-back European Cup wins in 1979 and 1980. Aston Villa worked in a silver star to their badge to symbolise their success in 1982.

The other Football League sides with stars are Bury (two for their titles in 1900 and 1903), Huddersfield (first team to win three league titles in a row between 1924 and 1926) and Ipswich (their three major trophies - league title in 1962, FA Cup in 1978 and UEFA Cup in 1981).

Other clubs take it to another level - Rangers wear five, each star representing 10 Scottish titles. Juventus, meanwhile, gained their third star with a 30th Scudetto last season.
