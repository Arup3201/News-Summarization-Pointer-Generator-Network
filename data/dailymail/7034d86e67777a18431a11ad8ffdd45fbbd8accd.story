For the City of New York, this fire hydrant may as well be gushing liquid gold.

Over the course of the year the city earned $33,000 in parking fines by luring unwary drivers who thought they were parking perfectly legally.

It doesn't help that that the fire hydrant which is positioned on the sidewalk is some seven feet away from the road.

However, if a car comes within 15-feet of such a device, that car will usually receive a ticket and be taken to the pound.

No parking allowed: A combination of road rules and confusing road markings is allowing the City of New York to rake in more than $33,000 a year in parking fines

To park or not to park: The painted white boxes make it appear to drivers that they're parking in a safe spot. In actual fact, the spot is not legal because it is adjacent to a fire hydrant. They may as well be pouring $115 down the drain

'If a particular address had a huge number of tickets, I suspected that something might be amiss. And with some help from NYC Open Data, I launched my so called 'investigation.'' wrote Ben Wellington, a statistics professor at Pratt Institute, for Gizmodo.

The fire plug is on Forsyth Street on New York's Lower East Side.

187 unsuspecting drivers have been caught in the last seven months alone.

Mr has calculated that with the fine costing $115, it works out to $21,505.

Blurred lines: The Lower East Side fireplug gushes out a flood of money for the city some $33,000 a year, according to one estimate by luring unwary drivers who think they¿re parking in a legal spot

The drivers blame two factors: white lines on the street look like the wide 'boxes' that are often used when parking is permitted.

'One theory is that technically, the lane behind the cars is not a protected bike lane. You would never know it by looking at it, but it is not painted and there are no markings. It is simply an empty space that people bike in.

Should that matter? Probably not, but the NYPD might think otherwise. Unless this is a deliberate attempt to craft a 'honeypot,' there should be clearer markings on the pavement to avoid this seemingly arbitrary ticketing,' says Mr Wellington.

A sidewalk extension that looks like a bike lane also creates added confusion for road users who may not realize that it is still prohibited to park in front of a hydrant, despite the large gaps and painted white lines.

Prepare to be towed: The painted white lines make it appear as though it is totally legal to park here, but the proximity of a fire hydrant should give cause for concern

The space between the lines is easily wide enough for a car and marked with diagonal lines at some points - but not in front of the hydrant.

Mr Wellington guesses that it is this particular hydrant that brings in the most money for the city out of all of the 110,000  fire-protection devices

The pictures from Google Street View show what appears to be a protected bike lane between between the cars and the hydrant.

The curb extension was constructed in 2008 to widen the sidewalk.

There is also a misconception that drivers think it is perfectly legal to park on the traffic-side line when a bike lane is between the sidewalk and the traffic lanes - even when a hydrant is on the sidewalk.

The law states that in such cases there has to be a sign specifically permitting parking there.

Mr Wellington has said the Department Of Transportation have confirmed to him that they will review the markings.
