Chinese workers masterminded a super efficient way of moving huge chunks of stone 43 miles in order to build China's famous Forbidden City, engineers have claimed.

Records dating from around the time of which the walled city was built, from 1406, tell that workers hauled stones weighing over 100 tonnes from a quarry 43 miles away from the site of the Forbidden City, using a network of man-made paths.

However, 600 years later, engineers have revealed that a system of wells and frozen roads were used to make the stones slippery and easier to move and were more efficient than alternatives.

Engineers looked into the efficiency of how the workers moved the chunks of stone. They calculated that without using the warm water (top image) 338 men would be needed to pull a stone weighing 123 tonnes and measuring 31 feet long. But using warm water to lubricate the icy road, just 46 men would be needed to move it (pictured bottom)

The Forbidden City was the Chinese imperial palace from the Ming Dynasty to the end of the Qing Dynasty.

It is located in the centre of Beijing, China and now houses the Palace Museum.

For almost 500 years, it served as the home of emperors and their households.

Built from 1406 to 1420, the complex consists of 980 buildings and covers 720,000 sqaured metres.

The site of the Forbidden City was situated on the Imperial City during the Mongol Yuan Dynasty, but upon the establishment of the Ming Dynasty, the Emperor moved the capital from Beijing in the north to Nanjing in the south, and ordered that the Yuan palaces be burnt down.

When his son Zhu Di became the Yongle Emperor, he moved the capital back to Beijing and construction began in 1406 of what would become the Forbidden City.

Construction lasted 14 years and required more than a million workers.

Materials used include whole logs of precious Phoebe zhennan wood found in the jungles of south-western China, and large blocks of marble from quarries near Beijing. The floors of major halls were paved with 'golden bricks'

Experts from two universities in Beijing and Princeton University in the U.S. believe the workers dug small wells every 500 metres along the man-made paths to reach water that they would pour to ice the paths in the winter, as well as lubricate them.

It is believed teams of men pulled the vast pieces of stone themselves.

Engineers calculated the amount of friction different methods of moving the stones would produce, including the use of logs as rollers - which are believed to have been used in the creation of many ancient stone monuments.

But their calculations showed sliding the stones over ice and using water to lubricate it, was the most efficient method of all, PopSci reported.

The team of engineers said winter in Beijing, 600 years ago, was cold enough to keep the roads frozen but so chilly that the ice alone would not have made a good lubricating layer of water between the bottom of wooden sledges used to carry the stones and the surface of the icy paths.

However, they believe the men poured just enough warm water onto the ice so that it would stay liquid and help them slide the sled along more easily.

The engineers calculated that without using the warm water, 338 men would be needed to pull a stone weighing 123 tonnes and measuring 31 feet long.

However, using warm water to lubricate the icy road, just 46 men would be needed to heave the same massive stone along.

The weight and dimensions of the stone used for the calculations come from a document written in 1557 after the huge architectural project was finished, which says men transported stones 43 miles.

The modern engineers believe that pulling sledges over ice paths lubricated with water, was a more efficient option that rolling the stones over logs.

In the study published in journalÂ Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, they said the coefficient (a quantitative expression of a specific property of matter) of friction for logs rolling along a path is 0.2 to 0.4, while using the water-and-ice-sliding method, has a coefficient of just 0.02.

The experts also said that sliding sledges is easier than using logs as it is easier to make a smooth ice road than to have to make a level one of planks and manoeuvre the log rollers as well as the huge chunk of stone.

Wheeled vehicles of the time would not have been able to support the weight of the large stones, according to the engineers, who think that the maximum weight carts would have been able to pull would have been 95 tonnes.

They said that ice roads and men were also more reliable than mules and carts, especially as the architects of the Forbidden City were reportedly worried about keeping the expensive stone safe.
