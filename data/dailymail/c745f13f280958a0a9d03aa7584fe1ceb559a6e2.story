Most of America has spent this winter shivering in a colder-than-usual polar plunge that's seen almost every state turned white and the Great Lakes freeze over.

But in Alaska, residents are wondering what's become of the blizzards and arctic lows that usually characterize the northernmost state.

The biggest city, Anchorage, is so unseasonably warm that a winter festival could only go ahead after trucks drove in snow from a stockpile, and hide it under PVC to stop it from melting away.

We took your winter! This was the scene Saturday on Boston Common, the heart of a city buried in snow - prompting the envy of Alaskans

Digging out: Boston's motorists found their cars swamped by snow, while the usually frigid land of Alaska was left hardly touched

Want some of this? In the Massachusetts capital, huge piles of snow have emerged as authorities struggle to find anywhere to put snow taken off the roads

Bemused residents even took to asking Boston - which has been swamped with more than 100 inches of snow in a record-breaking winter - if they can have their winter back.

Speaking to the Boston Globe, Anchorage-dweller Danielle Crelley, 19, said said: 'This is the worst winter ever... We can’t even go sledding. I just want to build a snowman.'

Another, store owner Nina Walker, proposed a trade between Massachusetts and Alaska. She said: 'You give us your snow, and we’ll give you the Palins.' Cameras from local station KTUU showed the snow-less scenes in the city.

Their comments follow an unusual set-up for the annual Fur Rendezvous festival, in which Anchorage city authorities had to spread a thin coating of snow from diminishing stockpile to create a winter feel. Sunday highs in the city are set to be above freezing, while Wednesday is predicted rain.

A dog sledding race, which usually winds through the Anchorage streets, has been relocated 260 miles north, where there is still enough snow. It was the first time the event had to move since it began in 1946.

Winter of two Americas: Climate figures showed that this winter has seen western states experience unseasonable warmth, while the east shivered. Alaska has been warmed by the same phenomenon heating California

Speaking to the KTVA station, former organizer Gary Huffard said: 'This weather is as crazy as it can get!'. He later encouraged people to come down to the event's funfair because, for once, 'you can enjoy the carnival without turning blue'.

It comes as cold weather records continue to fall across the country, with February declared the coldest month in New York for 81 years. Boston was predicted still more snow Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, adding to its current total of more than 100 inches since winter began.

The average temperature in the New York City over the last four weeks has been 24°F - 11 degrees below normal. New York joins other metropolitan areas such as Chicago and Pittsburgh, which have also experienced their most frigid February in decades.

As the mercury continues to plummet, ice breakers are being deployed by the US Coast Guard to create ferry and shipping lanes along the Hudson River in New York and the Delaware in Philadelphia.

Many already knew in their bones it was true - but official figures have now confirmed that for some parts of the country, February was the coldest month in history.

In New York, the cities of Buffalo, Syracuse, Binghamton and Ithaca all scored their lowest ever averages in more than a lifetime. In Buffalo the February average was 10.9°F, beating the 1934 record of 11.4°F. Syracuse was colder still, with an average of just 9°F.

Hartford, Connecitcut, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Portland, Maine also set records. Caribou in Maine had an average of just 2.5°F.

While Boston has been colder in February before, it has never been snowier. Its 64.8 inches in February smashed the old record of 41.6. If it managers just another 5.6 inches, the winter will officially be the snowiest ever.

Total snowfall for the season is way above normal across the Northeast, according to the National Weather Service. As of Febreuary 26, Worcester, Massachusetts had 108.6 inches, compared to a normal snowfall of 49.9 inches.

However, meteorologists at the Northeast Regional Climate Center said the record winter is just down to luck. One said: 'We can't point to anything specific... It's just the way the jet stream bulged and set up. It's random, like a deal of cards. Sometimes you're dealt a royal flush, sometimes you get nothing.'

According to The New York Times, it has not been this frigid in New York since February 1934.

That month it averaged 19.9°F. On February 9 of that year, the mercury sank 15 degrees below zero - the lowest daily reading in the city's history.

Jay Engle, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service, told The Times: 'It was like the most sick month you can think of.'

As the records continue to tumble - with almost 500 daily low-points being beaten in the last month - forecasters predict there's more on the way.  

Record-breaking: Ice chunks form underneath the snow-covered Brooklyn Bridge in New York City at the end of the coldest February in more than 80 years - and two more snow storms are expected to hit the region over the next few days

Duties continue: The tug Arabian Sea pushes a barge through the icy waters of the Hudson River on Friday, near Rhinecliff, in Upstate New York. With the prolonged cold winter weather, the Coast Guard has been busy clearing shipping lanes

This next winter storm will begin to take shape Saturday in California as a disturbance digs into the Southwest, bringing rain in the lower elevations and snow in the mountains.

Snow, sleet and ice will then spread eastward across the Plains, Midwest and Northeast through midweek. 

Texas has already seen six inches of snow as a result of the storm, with Oklahoma - seven inches - and New Mexico - one foot - also suffering from the wintry downpours.

Boston's all-time winter weather record is also at risk, after 102 inches of snow fell on the city in the space of a month. 

Insurance companies in the area are getting a historic number of claims from homeowners whose properties have been damaged by the weight of the snow.

Experts say that popping, creaking, or cracking noises can be signs of a stressed roof that could be about to collapse. Residents are warned to leave immediately in those cases.

Peter Judge, spokesman for the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, told the Boston Globe: 'If you are hearing loud cracking, like cracking wood, there is something going on up there. But if it’s just a variety of sounds, don’t automatically get everyone out of the building.'

Wintry conditions also caused chaos across the southeastern United States this week as the area saw an unprecedented amount of snowfall.   

Wet, heavy snow snapped tree limbs and cut power lines in North Carolina leaving more than 200,000 Duke Energy customers without electricity at one point. Nearly a foot of snow fell in parts of Alabama - closing roads, schools and businesses. 

A volunteer who works with the National Weather Service measured 11 inches of snow in the Guntersville area in the morning. Authorities said 8.5 inches of snow fell in the Athens area, with similar amounts reported in other towns and cities across northern Alabama. 

School's out: Children make snow angels in Richardson, Texas. A winter storm that dumped several inches of snow in Texas on Friday closed schools, snarled travel and forced a main highway into Oklahoma to shut down after nearly 20 vehicles slid off the road
