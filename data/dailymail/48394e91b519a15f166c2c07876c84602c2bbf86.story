Former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks and her husband are expecting a baby by a surrogate mother, her spokesman said.

The couple are understood to be the biological parents of a baby girl due in February.

Mrs Brooks married former racehorse trainer Charlie Brooks in 2009 and the couple spent years trying to conceive naturally before deciding to use a surrogate.

It is understood that the baby girl had a twin who died at an early stage of the pregnancy.

Mrs Brooks's spokesman David Wilson said: 'Charlie and Rebekah are overjoyed.

'While the pregnancy has not been without its difficulties and sadness, Charlie and Rebekah are obviously hoping for a very happy ending to almost five years of trying to conceive themselves.

'Both parents are acutely aware of the infertility problems encountered by many other couples, and in the longer term hope to recognise their own good fortune by working in some way to help others facing similar challenges.'

Probe: In July Brooks gave evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee on the News of the World phone-hacking scandal

The surrogate mother has not been named and wishes to remain anonymous.

Mrs Brooks, 43, who grew up in Warrington, Cheshire, edited the News of the World and the Sun before becoming chief executive of parent company News International in 2009.

Public furore erupted in July after it emerged that a private detective working for the News of the World hacked the mobile phone of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler.

Mrs Brooks resigned as News International chief executive on July 15. Two days later Scotland Yard detectives arrested her on suspicion of phone hacking and corruption.

She is currently on police bail. Her lawyer has said she denies committing any criminal offence.
