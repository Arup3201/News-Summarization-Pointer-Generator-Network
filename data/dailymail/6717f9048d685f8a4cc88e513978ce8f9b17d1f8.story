Heather Watson battled her way into the second round of the BNP Paribas Open with a scrappy three-set win over Julia Goerges in Indian Wells.

The British No 1 had not won on the WTA Tour since lifting the Hobart International title in January, but came through 6-4 5-7 6-3 against her German opponent.

It should have been easier for Watson, who served for the match in the second set before losing the next five games, but the 22-year-old overcame the setback to seal a last-64 clash with 29th seed Camila Giorgi.

The British No 1 was made to work for her win, and admitted she was nervous, but came through to progress

'I was definitely a bit nervous, I think it showed closing out the second set there, but I kept fighting and was able to play the right way to finish the third set,' Watson told BT Sport 2.

'I just kept fighting. We both didn't play our best tennis but it was a good match.'

In an opening set that featured seven breaks of serve, with neither player holding in the opening four games, Watson stole a march on Goerges in the 10th game to go ahead.

Georges fought back bravely from a set and a break down, and led in the third set before Watson responded

In the end the Brit battled hard to win in three, and set up a match against Camila Giorgi

Both players seemed to find some composure as the second set went with serve until a fantastic cross-court forehand in the eighth game gave Watson a 5-3 lead.

Goerges, though, capitalised on some loose play from Watson to take the next four games and force a decider.

The world number 62 then broke at the start of the third, but Watson immediately levelled the match before then breaking decisively in the eighth game before closing out the match in two hours and 25 minutes.
