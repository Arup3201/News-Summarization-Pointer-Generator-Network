A shockingly high proportion of homeless gay youth in New York engage in 'survival sex' in a bid to stay alive, a new government-funded report has revealed.

The Urban Institute - a non-profit organization investigating U.S. social and economic problems - quizzed 283 subjects over a three-year period.

On average, the youths reported seeing up to six customers a day, with rates ranging from $90 to $230. About 90per cent said the work made them feel 'frustrated', 'dirty' or 'endangered'.

Down and out: A shockingly high proportion of homeless LGBTQ youth in New York engage in 'survival sex' in a bid to stay alive, a new government-funded report has revealed

Only seven per cent of respondents said they had no desire to stop engaging in the activity.

However, more than 80 percent said there were positive aspects - notably helping meet their basic needs and in some cases fostering a sense of community.

'It's not as bad as sleeping under the bridge, it's not as bad as going without food,' one respondent said. 

Almost half (46per cent) said they became involved in the sex trade through friends or peers, while 26per cent were approached by someone they did not know. 

Most got clients on the streets of New York or by posting adverts online. 

The study, funded by the Justice Department's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, focused on youth between 15 and 21, although a handful of participants were older.

Of the respondents, 47per cent identified as male, 36per cent as female and 16per cent as transgender. 

About 90per cent were black, Latino or multiracial, and nearly 60per cent said they lived either in a shelter or on the street, often after being kicked out of their homes or aging out of foster care.

One gay 19-year-old told an interviewer how his mother had forced him to leave home.

'She didn't want me being gay, she wanted grandchildren, she didn't like my lifestyle,' he said. She still loved me but she just didn't want me being there.' 

Many of the youths said they had some means of protecting themselves physically when trading sex - knives and Mace were the preferred accessories.

On average, the youths saw 3 to 6 customers each day or night - and 11 to 18 a week - during periods when they were engaging in sexual transactions, according to the study.  

The report offered several recommendations for steps that might encourage such young people to disengage from the sex trade.

These included new programs that would offer safe housing, appropriate health care, and a pathway to job opportunities. the particular needs of LGBT youth in mind, the report said.

Any such services would be most effective if designed with the particular needs of LGBT youth in mind, the report said. 

The Urban Institute, which is based in Washington, D.C., did not attempt its own calculations of the overall number of LGBT youth engaged in the New York City's commercial sex market.

Its report cited earlier studies estimating the number at between 2,500 and 4,000 young people of all sexual orientations.

Meredith Dank, the report's lead author concluded: 'They don't see themselves as victims . . . but it's not empowering for them to be doing this..

'These are kids in very desperate situations who will do what they need to do to be able to survive.'
