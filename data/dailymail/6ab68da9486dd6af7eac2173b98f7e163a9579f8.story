Ginger map: Around 13 per cent of Scots, including actress Karen Gillan, have red hair - compared to 1-2 per cent of the world population

They are often the butt of cruel jibes and perhaps blame it on their parents’ genes.

But now research suggests that redheads can in fact put their colouring down to the weather.

Experts believe that Scotland’s gloomy climate has seen a deliberate genetic adaptation to help exploit rare sunny days and boost Vitamin D production.

Alastair Moffat, managing director of the ScotlandsDNA project, said the country’s dull weather was responsible for a larger number of flame-haired men and women being born.

Only about 1-2 per cent of the world’s population has red hair but in Scotland the figure is much higher, with about 13 per cent, or 650,000 people, with flaming locks.

Famous Scots with red hair range from Doctor Who actress Karen Gillan to football manager Alex McLeish, while the Disney/Pixar movie Brave features a red-haired Scottish Princess Merida.

Researchers are investigating how many people carry the red-hair gene and their findings will be used to make a ‘ginger’ map of the British Isles.

Mr Moffat said he wanted to map the number of possible carriers of the gene in Scotland in a bid to try to explain why so many Scots have red hair.

But yesterday he revealed his own theory, saying: ‘I think it’s to do with sunshine. We all need Vitamin D from sunshine but Scotland is cloudy.

‘We have an Atlantic climate and we need light skin to get as much vitamin D from the sun as possible.’

A person who does not have red hair can still produce red-haired children if their partner is a carrier of the gene.

Red hair appears in people with two copies of a recessive gene on chromosome 16, which causes a mutation. But despite concerns that red hair could be dying out, the experts say that it is likely to continue for many more generations.

The Centre for Equality Policy Research think tank recently controversially claimed that redheads suffer more discrimination per head of population than ethnic minorities.

They conducted an experiment and found that 'a job applicant with ginger hair is seven times more likely to be rejected than a dark-haired applicant, and eight times more likely than a fair-haired applicant.'

Barbara McNulty, lecturer in psychology at the University of the Western Isles, and herself a redhead, said: ‘Red hair still gives out deep cultural signals.

'Women, for example, are wild and quick-tempered, while ginger-haired men are unattractive and geeky.’
