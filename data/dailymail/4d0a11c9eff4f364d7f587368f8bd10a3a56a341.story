When Shaun and Lisa Cunliffe took new born baby Jessica home from hospital back in 1995 they found themselves inundated with cards and gifts.

One item that the proud parents found particularly touching was a circular silver balloon with a cute teddy bear printed on the front with the message: 'It's a GIRL!'.

The balloon was carefully packed away in a toy box and stored in a cupboard along with the cards and gifts and was not opened until Jessica reached her 18th birthday.

Then and now: Jessica Cunliffe as a newborn baby with the balloon in 1995 (left) and celebrating her 18th birthday after discovering it was still fully inflated after all those years (right)

By then the family had been through 
three house moves but incredibly when they opened the box they found the
balloon had remained fully inflated.

And
when Jessica was preparing to celebrate her big day Shaun, 44, and 
43-year-old Lisa, who have a 10 year old son Thomas, produced the 
balloon as a surprise at their home in Barnsley - along with a photo 
taken of the newborn Jessica with the balloon.

Mrs
Cunliffe, who runs the family news agent business with her husband, 
said: 'Jessica was born at Barnsley Hospital and obviously when we took 
her home there were loads of cards and presents.

'My
sister-in-law bought this lovely silver balloon on a stick and it was 
around for quite a while before we put all the stuff away in a cupboard.

'It
was put away in a toy box with all the other cards and things and just 
left there. We weren't particularly careful with it, we just threw it in
with everything else.

'But
it must have been a good balloon because it survived all this time. 
When Thomas came along we were rummaging around one day and he used it 
to play football in the house before it was put back in the cupboard.

Proud parents Shaun and Lisa Cunliffe pose with Jessica and the balloon shortly after her 18th birthday. The family have been through three house moves since her birth but the balloon has remained inflated all that time

'I don't think it was a helium balloon because it never floated up to the ceiling, but whatever is in it the balloon has kept its shape all these years.

'When Jessica was about to have her 18th birthday we got it out again and we found a picture of her with it when she was born.

'It's been a lovely thing to keep and it is still full inflated and hopefully we can keep it and if Jessica ever has a little girl of her own it would be nice for her to have it.'

Jessica, who has spent the last two years at Barnsley College and is due to study sport at Sheffield Hallam University in September, said: 'It's amazing that the balloon is still around and hasn't gone down, we never expected it to survive for so long.'
