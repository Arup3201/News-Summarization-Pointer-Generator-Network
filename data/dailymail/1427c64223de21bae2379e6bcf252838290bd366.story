He landed himself in trouble when he declared he would support anyone but England at football.

But it seems Andy Murray might have learned from the furore – by keeping his opinion over Scottish independence to himself.

Murray joked in an interview ahead of the 2006 World Cup that he would be supporting anyone but England and the remark has dogged him since.

It is still cited by some English people as a reason not to support him, even though the reigning Wimbledon champion has explained many times that he was not serious.

Murray, whose girlfriend Kim Sears is English, is one of Scotland’s highest-profile celebrities.

Even if he did decided to express his opinion ahead of the Scottish independence referendum, he cannot vote as he is a resident of England.

Speaking at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, California, Murray said: ‘I will take a position. My thoughts on it aren’t that relevant because I can’t vote myself.

‘I wouldn’t personally choose to make my feelings on something like that public either because not a whole lot of good comes from it', he added.

When a 19-year-old Andy Murray joked he would be supporting 'whoever England were playing against' at the forthcoming 2006 World Cup, he turned Wimbledon crowds hostile just when he needed them most.

Although he later excused it as a light-hearted jibe made during a joint interview with Englishmen Tim Henman in only his second-ever Wimbledon tournament, Murray has since admitted it cost him the support of many English tennis fans.

'I was only 19 or 20 at the time. I was still a kid, and I was getting things sent to my locker saying things like: 'I hope you lose every tennis match for the rest of your life'. That's at Wimbledon. Even people within the grounds at Wimbledon were saying that to me,' he revealed in 2012.

The outrage over the joke saw Murray openly abused as he walked around the Wimbledon site during the 2006 tournament, and the Dunblane-born player admitted to seeing his previously 'unbelievable' supporter base evaporate as tennis fans struggled to come to terms with the personality behind the racket.

The level of distrust among Murray's English supporters was so great that it was regularly said: 'Murray is British when he wins and Scottish when he loses'.

Murray posted several messages on his website after the incident, insisting that he was not in any way 'anti-English' and pointing out he even had an English girlfriend - artist Kim Sears.

He now says it took around eight years to live the joke down, with him only feeling truly forgiven when he won a gold medal at the 2012 London Olympics and took the title at Wimbledon last year.

Explaining why he's choosing not to go public with his opinion, Murray went on to say: 'I don’t know a whole lot about politics. I have made that mistake in the past and it’s caused me a headache for seven or eight years of my life and a lot of abuse.'

‘So I wouldn’t consider getting involved in something like that ever again.’

Murray’s comments mean he has backtracked on what he said following his Wimbledon triumph last summer, when he stated he would say what side he was on once he had made up his mind.

Murray spoke after beating Lukas Rosol 4-6,  6-3, 6-2 in the second round of the competition.
