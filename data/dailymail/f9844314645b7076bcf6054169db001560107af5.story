Serie A strugglers Parma have announced their game against Atalanta will go ahead as scheduled after reaching an agreement with a security firm to provide stewards for Sunday's match at the Stadio Ennio Tardini.

Parma's last two league matches against Udinese and Genoa have been postponed due to the club's financial crisis.

However GOS security firm have agreed to attend the game in order for the fixture to take place. 

Parma have an illustrious history, however the club are in dire straits financially and could go out of business

'Parma FC communicates that GOS [the security firm] met this morning at the police headquarters in Parma and have agreed to work at Parma-Atalanta at Stadio Tardini,' the club announced on their official website.

'As a result, Parma FC has independently guaranteed all the services required by the law.

'Parma FC thanks all the suppliers who have worked together with the club to achieve this outcome.'

Club captain Alessandro Lucarelli said before Parma's match against Genoa, which was due to take place on March 1, that his team-mates had requested for the game to be postponed.

It remains to be seen if Parma's first team stars will be willing to face Atalanta after threatening to go on strike.

Parma's players have not been paid since July, which has left Lucarelli and Co extremely disillusioned with their situation at the Italian outfit.
