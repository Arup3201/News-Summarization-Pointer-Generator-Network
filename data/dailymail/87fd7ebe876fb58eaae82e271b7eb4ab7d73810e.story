A suspicious white substance sent to at least five hotels near the Super Bowl stadium in New Jersey is believed to be cornstarch, according to authorities' preliminary results.

The office of former mayor Rudy Giuliani in Manhattan also received an envelope containing a suspicious white powder on Friday, but this too has been deemed non toxic.

The FBI and other law enforcement agencies swarmed the hotels in East Rutherford, New Jersey on Friday morning after the envelopes were reported and authorities continue to investigate.

Concerns: Emergency vehicles swarmed several hotels near the Super Bowl stadium in New Jersey on Friday after they received envelopes with white powder. Here, vehicles gather at the Quality Inn

Fears: Law enforcement and other personnel gather outside a post office in Rutherford, New Jersey as envelopes containing a white powder were reported at multiple hotels in the area

Precautions: Staff wearing hazmat gear descended on the Quality Inn near the Super Bowl stadium

But after preliminary tests, the substance does not seem to be harmful, the North Jersey Record reported.

New
 Jersey Mayor James Cassella confirmed on Friday afternoon that the fire
 chief said at least one hotel - the Homewood Suites in East Rutherford - were sent a letter containing cornstarch.

Carlstadt Police Detective John Cleary
earlier said someone at an Econo Lodge found the substance. Similar mailings arrived at the Homestead Inn and a Renaissance Inn.

He
 says investigators intercepted additional envelopes from a mail truck 
before it reached a Holiday Inn Express and Hampton Inn in Carlstadt.

A letter containing a white substance was
 also addressed to Giuliani and sent to the Manhattan office of his 
law firm, Bracewell & Giuliani, authorities said. The letter was 
opened in the mail room.

Recipient: A letter containing the substance was addressed to former mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani, pictured, at his Manhattan office but it was opened in the mail room. It has been deemed non-toxic

Scene: The letter was sent to Giuliani at his law firm's offices, which are based in Midtown

The powder at that location has officially been deemed non-toxic, CBS 2 reported. Eight mailroom workers were decontaminated as a precaution but no one has shown any sign of illness.

Jeanne
 Barratta, chief of staff to Bergen County Executive Kathleen Donovan, 
said that she did not know if anyone had been exposed to the substance.

Hazardous materials teams went to the scene and continue to investigate the substance in New Jersey. The FBI says it is investigating and no injuries have been reported.

'The
 Joint Terrorism Task Force and Hazard Materials units have responded to
 several locations that have received a suspicious letter and 
substance,' the New Jersey State Police wrote in a statement.

'There are no reported injuries at this time, and the locations are being secured.'

Law enforcement officials added that the incidents were considered a routine investigation rather than a threat.

Target: The EconoLodge is seen in front of the stadium - but authorities said the powder is cornstarch

The scare comes just two days before 
the Super Bowl between the Denver Broncos and the Seattle Seahawks, 
which will be attended by 82,000 fans.

Security is going to be tight at the game - with snipers and SWAT teams on the scene, while fighter jets will fly overhead.

Federal
 and local authorities have security teams on high alert and studied 
intelligence about recent attacks on mass transit in Russia, law 
enforcement officials said this week.

The
 NYPD has rehearsed its response to a variety of potential threats, 
including 'the backpack left unsecured scenario,' authorities said, 
while state police plan to assign up to 700 troopers at the stadium on 
Sunday.
