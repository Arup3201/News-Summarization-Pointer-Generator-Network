Rocco Leo, who fled to Fiji in 2010, allegedly promised to save cult members by taking them a place called 'The Island' in the South Pacific

A rural compound belonging to an Adelaide doomsday cult is going up for auction and being billed as a 'unique and flexible property' located in a 'beautiful hills setting'.

Agape Ministries cult leader Rocco Leo is being forced to sell the property to repay a $3 million tax bill and another $420,000 he owes to a former cult member who said she was brainwashed.

The 15.3 hectare Kuipto Colony Retreat, located one hour south of Adelaide, is set to go under the hammer on August 8 and is being sold by Ray White.

The 'highly improved' facilities boast a manager's residence, multiple dormitories, huge sheds, workshop, storage, two large dams and 'an extensive cellar'.

'Overlooking lake-like dams and being privately located in a beautiful hills setting between Meadows and Willunga, this unique and flexible property provides a plethora of possibilities for either private or commercial ownership,' the real estate ad reads.

'Whilst the current owners have upgraded and added to the property over the last 10 years, some finishing touches are still needed to complete the project.'

Leo led the notorious Agape Ministries and warned followers of a 2010 apocalypse, claiming that everyone on Earth would be implanted with microchips and those who refused would be killed by the government.

Leo, who fled to Fiji in 2010, allegedly promised to save cult members by taking them a place called 'The Island' in the South Pacific if they handed over their life savings.

Family members of Agave members said Leo told his followers he had purchased an island in Vanuatu and convinced them to hand over money – in some cases as much as $1 million – to fund their new life, the ABC reported.

In 2010 Leslie Baligod, whose son and two granddaughters were members of the cult, said the young girls aged six and eight had been promised in marriage to adult cult members and issued a public plea for their safety.

'These people believe you don't need doctors or hospitals. [They believe] all you do is pray to God and you're cured,' Ms Baligod said at the time.

She also told the ABC that: 'They were told to get rid of their mobile phones before leaving. Once they get through customs in Vanuatu they've been told to ditch their passports, so there will be no escape.'

Ms Baligod said the group were stockpiling weapons and all cult members had been given firearms training.

Agape ministries first came under the spotlight in 2010 after a police raid on a property at Oakden in Adelaide uncovered weapons, explosives and thousands of rounds of ammunition, the Adelaide Advertiser reported.

In 2012 Leo was ordered to pay $420,000 to former cult member Silvia Melchiorre after she claimed he duped her out of money

Leo's assets were subsequently frozen and Agape was stripped of its status as a religion and sued by the tax office for a decade's worth of payments.

In 2012 Leo was ordered to pay $420,000 to former cult member Silvia Melchiorre, a stroke survivor who was severely disabled, after she claimed he told her he could heal her and duped her out of money.

Last month, Australian Tax Office lawyers asked the Adelaide District Court to appoint receivers to oversee the sale of properties owned by Agape, including Kuipto Colony Retreat, because they still had not received their money, the ABC reported.

Agape has been given a final chance to sell the assets, and lawyers acting for Leo told Judge David Lovell the properties would be auctioned in August.
