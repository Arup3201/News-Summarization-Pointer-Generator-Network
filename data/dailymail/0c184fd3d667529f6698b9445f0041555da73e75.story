If you have grown used to doing the weekly shop online you may want to get out of the habit.

Delivery charges could rise to £15 a time, according to retail experts.

Picking out all your items, bagging them up and delivering each order to your door actually costs supermarkets up to £20 - a far cry from the £5 usually charged for the service.

The charge would need to rise to as much as £15 a time to reflect the true costs involved, according to Dr Clive Black, head of research at Shore Capital Stockbrokers, a leading retail analyst.

He claimed the relatively low fee means that online shoppers are effectively being subsidised by everyone else.

He said poorer families, who tend to shop in stores only, are charged  more for their food in order to offset the cost of providing online shopping to others.

Dr Black said only big hikes in delivery charges would make the service economical for the businesses involved.

Three of the major supermarkets, Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s, currently offer home grocery deliveries, while Waitrose and Ocado have separate home-shopping operations.

Demand is growing enormously, with Waitrose recently reporting a 50 per cent increase in home shopping customers. Online orders account for around one in 20 weekly shops, while sales are growing at around 15 per cent a year.

Despite this popularity, most supermarkets do not make a profit from their online grocery operations.

‘Supermarket online grocery is more of a service than a profit generator due to the cost of fulfilment,’ said Dr Black.

As more customers switch to this option, supermarkets will come under intense pressure to push up delivery charges in order to avoid big losses, he said.

'In the long run, the service cost of home delivery will need to be better covered if this growing channel is not going to deplete returns and penalise the poor'

‘Online grocery without proper charging for distribution is not a sustainable model,’ he told The Grocer magazine.

‘In the long run, the service cost of home delivery will need to be better covered if this growing channel is not going to deplete returns and penalise the poor.

‘More grocery orders online may make it more economic to fulfil them, but charges of around £10-15 would be more cost covering than the present system which runs from free delivery to £6.50.’

Dr Black said the high costs have stopped major chains such as Morrisons and Marks & Spencer from launching their own online food stores.

Looking ahead, he expects Morrisons to dip a toe in the water with the online sale of wine before developing a more substantial web business. ‘Marks & Spencer is also assessing the market, but we’d be surprised to see anything too major within the next 18 months,’ he said.
