Jailed: Gintas Burinskas raped a woman in Northampton after moving to the UK from Lithuania

A Lithuanian who was allowed to come to Britain despite being convicted of rape in his home country attacked another woman within a month of arriving.

Gintas Burinskas, 36, walked into Britain unchecked just three months after he was released from a ten-year jail term.

Weeks later, he travelled to Northampton where he dragged a woman off the street and violently assaulted her.

A court heard Burinskas throttled the 31-year-old so hard she passed out before dragging her to a wooded area nearby where he raped her.

Charities and politicians reacted with outrage after it emerged he could be freed on parole in a little over three years.

And they demanded to know why Burinskas was admitted into the country in the first place.

Northampton North MP Michael Ellis urged Attorney General Dominic Grieve to review the length of Burinskas’s sentence. He said: ‘I’m not sure how the sentence length of this evil man’s second identical crime can be shorter than his first. He is obviously pathologically dangerous.’

Dawn Thomas, who runs the Northampton branch of charity Rape Crisis, said: ‘The fact a man who was convicted of rape in his own country was allowed to come over to ours so easily and commit the very same crime is something which is of grave concern to us.’

The court heard Burinskas was drinking cider in Northampton town centre when he spotted the woman walking nearby.

James House, prosecuting, said the woman avoided eye contact with him and tried to walk away, but he approached her from behind, grabbed her around the throat and began to squeeze.

Mr House said: ‘The woman tried to get away, but he was too strong. She shouted for help but her  calls went unheeded.’ Burinskas then pressed harder on the woman’s windpipe until she lost consciousness and dragged her to bushes nearby.

When she woke up, Burinskas smashed her in the face – breaking her jaw – and tried to suffocate her again while pouring cider over her face. She was then raped.

Following the incident, Burinskas fled and the woman, by now covered in blood, staggered to a nearby hotel to raise the alarm. Officers began a search of the area and arrested Burinskas a short time later.

The court heard how the attack had left the victim suffering depression and requiring counselling.

Burinskas, who has a string of 
previous convictions in Lithuania, including rape, burglary and drugs, 
pleaded guilty to rape and grievous bodily harm last month.

But at Northampton Crown Court on 
Thursday Judge Rupert Mayo sentenced him to just seven years in jail – 
after giving him a five-year discount for his early guilty plea. He will
be eligible to apply for parole at the half way point, and, if turned 
down, will automatically be released two-thirds of the way through that 
term. As Burinskas has already served four months on remand, it means he
could be paroled just over three years into his sentence.

He was also handed a four-year jail term for grievous bodily harm, to be served concurrently.

Sentencing, Judge Rupert Mayo said Burinskas posed a ‘significant risk’ to other women.

Any foreign national sentenced to more than 12 months in custody is automatically recommended for deportation.

It is believed Burinskas came to 
Northampton in November 2012 to visit a family member. He has previously
served a total of 19 years behind bars in Lithuania.

In most instances, EU rules mean 
Britain must open its doors to citizens of a fellow EU country, even if 
they have a criminal record. But offenders who pose a ‘serious risk’ – 
such as a rapist – can be turned away by border officials.

Lithuania, like other EU member 
states, has given an undertaking to warn if a dangerous individual may 
be travelling to the UK. Last night it remained unclear if the 
Lithuanians had complied with that undertaking or not.

In January last year, Lithuanian 
builder Rimvydas Liorancas battered a Birmingham couple to death at 
their home after slipping in to the country unnoticed despite 
convictions for armed robbery and other offences in his homeland.
