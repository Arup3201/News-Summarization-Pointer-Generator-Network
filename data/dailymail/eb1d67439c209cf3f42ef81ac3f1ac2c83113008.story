Tragic twist: Marine Lance Cpl Andrew Silva, 23, was killed less than a month after returning home from Afghanistan when a suspected drunken driver smashed into his motorcycle

U.S. Marine Andrew Silva had survived a tour of duty in Afghanistan, but less than a month after returning home to his wife and son, the 23-year-old soldier was struck and killed by a suspected drunken driver in California.

Silva died in the crash last Tuesday morning in Fremont after police say Alexander Yohn, 23, rammed his Mini Cooper into the veteran’s brand-new motorcycle.

Police arrested Yohn, of Emeryville, in a nearby field after his car smashed into a utility pole. Witnesses say earlier Yohn had been acting belligerently and appearing intoxicated while going through a Taco Bell drive-through.

He has been charged with murder, gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and hit-and-run causing death or injury.

Silva was a Marine lance corporal who had returned from Afghanistan in February after spending six months in Helmand Province. He is survived by his wife, Julie, and their 2-year-old son, Noah. 

According to Silva’s family, the young veteran was planning to go back to college and pursue a career in law enforcement, Mercury News reported. 

‘He survived all the bullets and bombs
 and explosions, and then he comes home and this happens,’ said Father 
Geoffrey Baraan, the pastor at Saint Anne Catholic Church, where Silva’s
 family have worshiped for years.

Tragedy struck at around 1.15am last Tuesday as Silva was riding his new 2014 Harley-Davidson from his parents' house to his in-laws' home.

At the intersection of Fremont Boulevard and Decoto Road, Silva’s bike was struck by Yohn’s Mini Cooper doing about 90mph, according to police.

The impact sent Silva 
and his ‘hog’ flying into the air. He was pronounced dead at the scene, 
but his body was not removed until 15 hours later as police investigated
 the accident. 

When 
police caught up with Yohn, who had fled to a field, the driver 
allegedly admitted that he had downed at least five whiskey shots before
 getting behind the wheel against the advice of a friend.

Shorlty before the deadly collission, police got a 911 call from a Taco Bell worker, who reported that Yohn appeared very drunk while buying food from the drive-through window.

A police officer spotted Yohn's Mini Cooper on Fremont Boulevard and tried to stop him, but the 23-year-old EMT allegedly blew through a red light and collided with Silva.

Yohn, 23, also revealed to investigators that he was a recovering heroin addict and alcoholic. His profession was listed as EMT.

Online court records show that Yohn had been convicted of a DUI charge in Minnesota.

Over
 the past week, friends and family have been leaving mementos and 
photographs at the spot where Silva lost his life. The makeshift 
memorial now includes the veteran's uniform, flowers and even a dish of noodles -
 his favorite meal.

The oldest of four sons, Silva joined the US Marines Corps at age 18, right after graduating from James Logan High School, where he played football, wrestled and sang in a choir.

‘Andrew was an absolute stud,’ said Andrew Masis, 21, who served with him in Afghanistan. ’He was at the front of the pack in everything he did, and he was very wise. I hope the whole world gets to know about Andrew now.’
