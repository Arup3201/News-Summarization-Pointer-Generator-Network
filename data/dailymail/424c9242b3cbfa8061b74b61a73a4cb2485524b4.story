The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge flew the flag for the UK today at an event to celebrate British creativity.

William and Kate were attending a GREAT reception at NeueHouse, a creative work space in Gramercy, Manhattan, for media types.

Wearing a black dress by maternity label Seraphine with a gold hooped Cartier necklace and her hair swept back in a funky pony tail, Kate chatted with guests including actor Sir Patrick Stewart. 

The list featured a host of representatives from the creative industries including  Glenda Bailey, editor-in-chief of Harper’s Bazaar, Amanda berry, chief executive of Bafta, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, media mogul Harvey Weinstein, and his Marchesa designer wife Georgina Chapman, and author Imogen Lloyd-Webber, daughter of the musicals composer Lord Lloyd-Webber.

As they mingled, the throng dined on British themed canapes including mini Yorkshire puddings and Scotch egg bites washed down with PG Tips tea and Old Speckled Hen ale. 

Sir Patrick, accompanied by his wife, Sunny Ozell, said afterwards: 'I have met many members of the Royal family before but what a personable, pleasant and, may I say, attractive couple.

'Prince William told me he had never been to New York before which, I must say, surprised me greatly. I was even more surprised that the Duchess hasn't been. I urged them to come back again incognito. New York is the type of city that turns a blind eye and would allow you to do that. '

Sir Patrick said he had recently taken William's cousin, Princess Eugenie, who is currently working in New York, as his guest to his latest show on Broadway, Waiting for Godot.

Tuesday morning started off on a somber note for William and Kate as they made a visit to the 9/11 Memorial where they laid white roses and a handwritten note for the victims who lost their life in the tragedy.

And though the weather was gloomy, gray and rainy, Kate provided a nice pop of color in a fashionable bright pink jacket from Mulberry. 

From there the two headed off to watch some young people from CityKids, a group that promotes leadership among inner city youth, perform a dance routine.

William lead a standing ovation for the group, while Kate took some time to get in a selfie with some of the members.

The day will end with a fundraising dinner at the Metropolitan Museum of Art benefiting their 600-year-old alma mater, the University of St Andrews. 

Then it is right to the airport where the two will board a plane and fly home to see Prince George.

Monday night offered them at least a little bit of time for fun as the couple attended a Brooklyn Nets game at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, getting to meet both music and sports royalty.

Kate, in black skinny J Crew jeans and a Tory Burch coat, and William, in slacks and a casual shirt with his sleeves rolled up, got a chance to chat with Beyonce and Jay Z during the game, and afterwards spend some time with Cleveland Cavaliers player and NBA great LeBron James, who presented the two with cupcakes from his home town of Akron, Ohio, and a Cavaliers jersey for Prince George.

James also committed a bit of a royal faux pas when he placed his hand on the small of Kate's back during a photo with the two. 

Prior to the game The Duke and Duchess met with political royalty, when they attended an event for The Tusk Trust alongside Hillary Clinton and her daughter Chelsea.

Hillary and Kate bonded as they talked about children, and how much Hillary used to love to sing to Chelsea, and now her new granddaughter Charlotte.

In New York, Kate met up with Chirlane McCray, the wife of New York City mayor Bill de Blasio, as the two visited the Northside Center for Child Development in Harlem, where some of the children had thought that the princess they were going to meet was Elsa from Frozen.

After that, Kate headed to a luncheon at the British Consul General’s residence in New York, where she meet with members of the British community involved in the arts and culture, including actor Matthew Rhys and producer Colin Callender.

Following the meeting, William headed over to the World Bank headquarters, where he dined with experts on illegal wildlife trafficking.
