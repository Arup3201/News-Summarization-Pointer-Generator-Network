Laughing and joking, stroking stray dogs and relaxing at a fun fair, these are members of North Korea's fearsome People's Army as you've never seen them before.

Usually seen snarling as part of an intimidating mass of synchronised marching, the soldiers from the tyrannical nation show their softer, more human side in these new images from French photographer Eric Lafforgue, 47.

Mr Lafforgue took the snaps during six trips to the secretive state.

Chilling at the fair: This young soldier shows an entirely different side to North Korea as she enjoys her ride on a rollercoaster

Soft touch: A North Korean soldier pets a stray dog in a photograph, which is part of a collection of new snaps showing the troops in a happier light

The smiling face of North Korea: Not a sentence that immediately springs to mind about the secretive state but, as this soldier shows, its army does have a lighter side

High morale: A posse of female soldiers pose for a team photo and project a far from fearsome image, while a colleague smiles by a map

At the fair, the young men and women - in full military attire - can be seen laughing and playing on a tin-can shooting range.

Elsewhere females happily pose for the camera, while one takes time out of her duties to stroke a stray dog sprawled out on the ground.

Speaking of his unique insight, Eric said: 'The army in North Korea is everywhere - in the fields, at the fun fair, in museums.

Even he's smiling: Leader Kim Jong Un pats a goat on the head

High jinks: The military attire is the same but the faces are different as the soldiers' expressions of happiness are quite different from the usual snarls

Not a care in the world: These three soldiers prove there is more to life in North Korea than synchronised marching

Beaming: Another soldier has a laugh and a joke

'They have opened two new fun fairs recently and they are packed every night.

'I had the opportunity to meet some army personnel. They were mostly young and once away from the chiefs, are just like any other teenagers in any other country.

'They liked football and were crazy for Messi and Ronaldo. It is only in the DMZ that they do not really smile."

Spectacular: Women dressed in Korean People's Army costume dance during an event at the May First Stadium in Pyongyang

Relaxed: Soldiers chat and smoke while taking a break

What a day: The soldiers leave the fair and can't contain their happiness

Attention: A saluting soldier flashes a smile in a field

Eric's trips captured the diverse life of soldiers in the country where conscription is universal.

Mandatory service in the country is between three and five years, with selective conscription for females.

Eric added: 'I wanted to document the life of soldiers in North Korea because they are totally a part of the nations identity.

Propaganda: A military poster in the capital shows the more unsavoury side to the country

'If you remove them, you remove probably 30 percent of the people you see on a day-to-day basis.

'I spoke to soldiers in the DMZ who were there to make a speech to the hundred or so tourists, but as I met them for the third time they spoke about Obama and their defence.

'They had a lot of humour. When I asked them where all the Americans were on the other side of the border, they said "Mr Eric, it is half past 12, the Americans are having lunch!"'.
