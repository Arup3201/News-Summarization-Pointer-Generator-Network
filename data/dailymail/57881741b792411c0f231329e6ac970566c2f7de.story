If you were impressed by Jessica Ennis's nails at the Olympics, prepare to be amazed.

The best and most creative nail technicians from around the world compete in the International Nail Olympics - or Nailympics - each year.

And this time, we're got behind-the scenes photos of the most extravagant designs from Rome.

Horror story: A model displays a creation called From Charleston to Burlesque by Federica Lovascio

Eight judges from Japan, the USA, Korea,
Italy, Sweden, and the Czech Republic chose winners in seven 
specialties among 220 competitors in the two day competition of nail art
from the technical to the fantastic.

Art on show on Monday included a 'From Charleston to Burlesque' design, themed around a busy mess of feathers and figurines of 1920s flapper girls, suited gentlemen and showgirls.

Another pirate ship design featured skulls, mermaids and lots of seaweed, while many less busy designs were long and pointy acrylics sprayed with coloured paint effects.

But most impressive of all was a 
Japanese design of carefully balanced Geisha girls stuck on top oriental
decorated talons, which was best observed with a hand laid flat.

The first Nail Olympics took place in 
Las Vegas on 2001, since then the competition has spread around the 
globe.

The Nailympics draws thousands of 
competitors from over 50 countries worldwide at its various global 
competition locations.

Their website says of the competition: 'From Los Angeles to London the 
Nailympics has created an artistic atmosphere where a beginner or 
seasoned professional can test their skills against the best competitors
in the world.

'We
want you to fall in love with the nail industry again by reaching 
outside your comfort zone and trying something new, something that will 
make you grow even if it makes you a little uncomfortable.'
