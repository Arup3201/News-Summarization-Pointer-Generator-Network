An ice cream parlour in Rome which charged British tourists £54 for four cones has taken out a newspaper advert justifying its high prices.

The Antica Roma gelataria charged brothers Roger and Stephen Bannister and their wives the sum when they stopped at the outlet near the city's famous Spanish Steps.

When the unlucky tourists complained, 
they were told the cost would have been double if they had eaten their 
gelatos at a table instead of standing up. One Rome councillor called 
the prices ‘a scandal’.

They had ordered three scoops of ice 
cream each to take away from the Antica Roma cafe near the Spanish 
Steps, and were charged €64 (£54) for their snacks.

The family complained about the cost to a national newspaper - reigniting a debate over high prices faced by tourists in parts of Italy.

But the firm has responded by taking out a full page advert titled 'the price is right,' in which it justifies the cost of its products.

Managers at the company said the outlet offers cones for about £2, but that the British tourists, from Stourbridge, West Midlands, had chosen ice creams with 'a big wafer and special ingredients,' the Telegraph reports.

Ice cream is big business in Italy. There are 37,000 independent ice cream makers in the country and the industry employs 150,000 people.

360,000 tonnes of ice cream are consumed in Italy each year and the market is worth £3.2 billion annually.

It is one of the few products that has not been hit by recession — with sales up by more than five per cent in the past year.

The most expensive ice creams in Italy used to be those served at the Gran Caffe Lavena in Venice where two scoops cost nearly £12, according to Italian chef Antonio Carluccio.

But this now appears to have been overtaken by the £13.50 ice creams on sale at the Antica Roma ice cream parlour.

The
firm claims the high quality of its ice cream has helped it survive the
country's economic crisis and that its business has continued to grow.

The Bannisters were offered a free trip back to Rome by the city's mayor Gianni Alemanno after their story made headlines across the world.

Roger Bannister earlier described how the group had been on a six-day trip to Rome, adding: 'Up until 
then we'd had a brilliant time, but that left a bad taste in the mouth –
quite literally.

'To be honest the ice cream wasn't that nice either. 
We'd had better ones earlier on in the holiday.

'I felt I had been ripped off but what could I do?'

Matteo Costantini, a local councillor,
said of the tourists' ordeal: 'They were justifiably outraged at what 
they had been asked to pay, and it should not be allowed.

'There needs to
be a clampdown on places like this that charge extortionate prices to 
unsuspecting tourists.

'It does nothing for the image of the city and will probably put people off coming here.'
