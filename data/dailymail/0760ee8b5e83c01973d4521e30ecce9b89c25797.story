Singing astronaut Chris Hadfield, whose orbital version of David Bowie's Space Oddity went viral last month, has announced his retirement from the space programme.

The musical astronaut, 53, who gained international prominence for his regular use of social media from space, announced his departure in his usual style - on Twitter.

The well-loved space-walking star tweeted on Monday a photo of all of Canadian Space Agency (CSA) colleagues waving goodbye to him, with the words: 'To say goodbye to these good people today was much harder than I expected.'

Signing off: Astronaut Chris Hadfield gave a thumbs up after his last space mission landed safely last month. He tweeted his retirement yesterday

At an earlier press conference, at the CSA headquarters in Montreal, Chris said he will depart next month, leaving behind his longtime home in Houston, where he built his career as an astronaut.

After decades away from his family, 
he told the media he now plans to do talks and presentations on space 
while reflecting over the coming year on his next move.

Chris dined with the Canadian Prime Minister, Stephen 
Harper, and his wife prior to his final farewell speech at the CSA HQ.

His departure draws to a close a 
lifetime of work as a pilot and astronaut, which began in 1992 when he 
was selected as one of four new Canadian astronauts from a field of 
5,330 applicants.

His first space mission would be just three years later.

Tweeting goodbye: The astronaut has become an internet sensation through his prolific tweets including incredible videos and pictures from space

The military fighter pilot was first 
assigned by the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) to the NASA Johnson Space 
Center in Houston, Texas in August of the same year.

His first astronaut job was to 
address technical and safety issues for shuttle operations development; 
he contributed to the development of the glass shuttle cockpit; and 
supported shuttle launches at the Kennedy Space Center, in Florida.

In addition, Hadfield was NASA's 
Chief CapCom, the voice of mission control to astronauts in orbit, for 
25 space shuttle missions.

From 1996 to 2000, he represented CSA astronauts and coordinated their activities as the chief astronaut for the CSA.

He then moved to Russia for two 
years, as director of operations for NASA at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut 
Training Centre (GCTC) in Star City, Russia.

He coordinated and directed all 
International Space Station (ISS) crew activities in Russia, including 
the training and crew support staff.

It was in Russia that Chris trained 
to become a fully qualified  flight engineer cosmonaut for the Soyuz TMA
spacecraft, and performed 'space-walks' in the Russian Orlan spacesuit.

In 2003, Chris retired as a Colonel 
from the Canadian Air Force (after 25 years of military service), to be a
civilian CSA astronaut.

Until 2006 he was based in Houston, Texas, eventually being chief of International Space Station Operations until 2008.

Chris announced on his biography webpage, that he would retire from the CSA as of July 4, 2013 'to take up new challenges'.

The announcement comes less than a 
month after his final space mission safely touched down to Earth, 
following five months' work on the International Space Station (ISS).

Live footage on NASA TV showed the Soyuz TMA-07M capsule slowly descending by parachute onto the steppes under clear skies.

Coming home: This NASA pictures shows the capsule floating to Earth on the barren steppes of Kazakhstan

Touchdown! The Russian Soyuz space capsule lands some 150 kms southeast of the town of Dzhezkazgan in central Kazakhstan

The capsule touched down exactly as planned, and rescue crews were soon on site to help the astronauts emerge 	Handle

Rescue
teams moved quickly to help the crew in their bulky spacesuits exit 
through the narrow hatch of the capsule. They were then put into 
reclining chairs to start adjusting to Earth's gravity after 146 days in
space.

'It's just been an extremely 
fulfilling and amazing experience end to end,' Hadfield told Mission 
Control. 'From this Canadian to all the rest of them, I offer 
an enormous debt of thanks.'

He was referring to all those in the Canadian Space Agency who helped make his flight possible.

During his five-month mission, the 
Canadian astronaut regularly posted photos of life on board via Twitter,
recorded video interviews and performed his now viral version of David 
Bowie's Space Oddity.

Hadfield
bowed out of orbit by posting a music video on YouTube on Sunday - his 
own custom version of David Bowie's 'Space Oddity.'

'With deference to the genius of 
David Bowie, here's Space Oddity, recorded on Station. A last glimpse of
the World,' Hadfield said via Twitter.

The video has now been watched almost
16 million times on youtube.com. It's believed to be the first music 
video made in space, according to NASA.

Hadfield often sang in orbit, using a
guitar already aboard the complex, and even took part in a live, 
Canadian coast-to-coast concert in February that included the Barenaked 
Ladies' Ed Robertson and a youth choir.

The five-minute video drew a salute 
from Bowie's official Facebook page: 'It's possibly the most poignant 
version of the song ever created.'

The ISS is the biggest orbiting outpost ever built and can sometimes be seen from Earth with the naked eye.

It consists of more than a dozen modules built by the United States, Russia, Canada, Japan and the European Space Agency.

The three-man crew left the International Space Station last month landing safely on the morning of May 14.

Earlier this year the first British astronaut was selected by Nasa to take part in future International Space Station missions.

A former Army helicopter pilot called
Major Tim Peake was selected in May to spend six months on board the 
International Space Station.

Major Peake’s mission will see the 
41-year-old blasted into space on a Russian Soyuz rocket from Baikonur 
in Kazakhstan in November 2015.

Superstar: Chris Hadfield has developed millions of adoring fans for the YouTube videos that he has posted in his five months as commander of the International Space Station

Hadfield's most recent hit was his cover of David Bowie's 'Space Oddity'

Major Peake is the only Briton ever to be accepted into the European Astronaut Corps.

His mission will make him the first 
UK national to travel and work in space, under the Union Jack, on a 
British Government-funded mission.

Other British astronauts have either 
secured private funding – such as Helen Sharman, who flew on a Russian 
rocket in 1991 – or taken dual citizenship, such as Michael Foale and 
Piers Sellers, who flew missions on the US space shuttle.

The International Space Station 
mission is just one of the many missions Nasa is conducting in a bid to 
learn more about life in space.

In May, a Russian space capsule 
carrying animals including mice, lizards, newts and gerbils  landed back
on Earth after spending a month in space.

The animals were subjected to various
tests, during and after the trip, so Russian scientists could test the 
effects weightlessness had on their skeletons, nervous systems, muscles 
and hearts.

The Bion-M capsule carrying the 
animals made the successful landing in the Orenburg Region, about 745 
miles southeast of Moscow, but all the gerbils died, as did the majority
of the mice and newts.

November 1995 Hadfield served as Mission Specialist 1 on STS-74, NASA's second space shuttle mission to rendezvous and dock with the Russian Space Station Mir. During the flight, the crew of Space Shuttle Atlantis attached a five-tonne docking module to Mir and transferred over 1,000 kg of food, water, and scientific supplies to the cosmonauts. Hadfield flew as the first Canadian mission specialist, the first Canadian to operate the Canadarm in orbit, and the only Canadian to ever board Mir.April 2001 Hadfield served as Mission Specialist 1 on STS-100 International Space Station (ISS) assembly Flight 6A. The crew of Space Shuttle Endeavour delivered and installed Canadarm2, the new Canadian-built robotic arm, as well as the Italian-made resupply module Raffaello. During the 11-day flight, Hadfield performed two spacewalks, which made him the first Canadian to ever leave a spacecraft and float freely in space. In total, Hadfield spent 14 hours, 54 minutes outside, travelling 10 times around the world.From 2008-09 Hadfield served as the backup for Dr. Bob Thirsk for Expedition 20/21, a long-duration spaceflight, training to live and work on board the ISS for a period up to six months. After this assignment, he supported the ISS Operations Branch and developed Emergency procedures for the ISS.May 2010 Hadfield was the Commander of NEEMO 14, a NASA undersea mission to test exploration concepts living in an underwater facility off the Florida coast. NEEMO 14 used the ocean floor to simulate exploration missions to the surface of asteroids, moons and Mars in order to gain a better understanding of how astronaut crews interact with equipment including advanced spacesuits, a lander, a rover and robotic arms.June 2010Hadfield was part of the Pavilion Lake research team, located 420km northeast of Vancouver. Pavilion Lake is one of the few places on Earth where microbialites are found. The team used a combination of remotely operated vehicles, autonomous underwater vehicles, SCUBA divers and DeepWorker submersibles to help understand how the microbialites formed and possibly make it easier to identify potential forms of extraterrestrial life on future missions to Mars.September 2010Chris Hadfield was assigned to Expedition 34/35. On December 19, 2012 he launched aboard the Russian Soyuz, en route to becoming the second Canadian to take part in a long-duration spaceflight aboard the ISS. On March 13, 2013 he became the first Canadian to command a spaceship as Commander of the ISS during the second portion of his five-month stay in space. On May 13, Hadfield, Tom Marshburn and Roman Romanenko landed in Kazakhstan after travelling almost 99.8 million kilometres while completing 2,336 orbits of Earth. The trio spent 146 days in space, 144 of which were aboard the station.
