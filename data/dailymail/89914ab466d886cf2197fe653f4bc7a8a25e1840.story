Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander has said 'political correctness' stops people speaking out against Christian persecution for fear of causing offence

Politicians should not let a ‘sense of embarrassment’ about religion stop them speaking out against persecution of Christians, a Labour frontbencher has said.

Foreign affairs spokesman Douglas Alexander said Christians are under growing attack around the world, and referred to Blair spin doctor Alastair Campbell’s phrase, ‘We don’t do God’.

He said: ‘Perhaps through . . . some sense of embarrassment at “doing God” in an age when  secularism is more common, too many politicians seem to fear  discussing any matters relating to faith.

'So the growing persecution of Christians around the world remains a story that goes largely untold.’

The Labour shadow foreign secretary's calls follow a speech by Prince Charles last week in which the heir to the throne warned that Christianity was beginning to disappear from its birthplace because members and places of worship were being targetted.

Writing in The Sunday Telegraph, Mr Alexander said: 'Across the world, there will be Christians this week for whom attending a church service this Christmas is not an act of faithful witness, but an act of life-risking bravery. That cannot be right and we need the courage to say so.

'People of all faiths and none should be horrified by this persecution. We cannot, and we must not, stand by on the other side in silence for fear of offence.'

Mr Alexander, who is a Church of 
Scotland follower, added that persecution of Christians should be viewed in the same way as anti-Seminism or Islamophobia, and not just opposed by lone voices.

Speaking at an event for Middle East Christians, Prince Charles said that bridges between Islam and Christianity were being 'deliberately destroyed' and that Christianity was being driven from its birthplace

He said he had felt 'very personally' an attack on a Church of Scotland place of worship in September which killed 122 including the mother, nephew, niece, two uncles and other friends of the priest.

Last week Prince Charles said that bridges between the Islamic and Christian communities he had worked to foster were being 'deliberately destroyed'.

Speaking at an event for Middle East Christians in Clarence House, he said: ‘It seems to me that we cannot ignore the fact that Christians in the Middle East are increasingly being deliberately targeted by fundamentalist Islamist militants.

‘Christianity was literally born in the Middle East and we must not forget our Middle Eastern brothers and sisters in Christ.’

Others have also issued warnings on the issue, including Baroness Warsi who delivered a speech to the House of Lords last month on the 'mass exodus' of Christians from the Middle East, and former Chief Rabbi Lord Sacks.

Mr Alexander's comments come in stark contrast to the Labour government's stance under Tony Blair, when Alastair Campbell famously said that the party 'doesn't do God'.

Since retiring from politics Mr Blair himself has become a Roman Catholic, and says he was a believer while in office but was too afraid to admit it in case he was viewed as 'a nutter'.

The article by Mr Alexander marks a shift towards religion in politics, with David Cameron being an active member of the Church of England - though he admits his faith can be patchy - and Ed Miliband saying he has a 'huge respect' for people who believe in God, despite being an atheist himself.

Mr Alexander’s words were welcomed by Church leaders. The Rt Rev Lorna Hood, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, said: 'Too often these situations are ignored by politicians worried at offending someone. Such silence should be offensive to all who cherish the right to live safely in a pluralistic society.'
