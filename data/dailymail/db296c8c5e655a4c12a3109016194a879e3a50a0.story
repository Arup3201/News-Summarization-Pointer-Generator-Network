GUILTY: Barbara Brooks, 64, will spend the next five years in prison on four counts of rape

An elderly babysitter pleaded guilty on Friday to molesting several young children while she took care of them at her Cincinnati home.

Barbara Brooks, 64, was accused of raping three girls and a boy, 7 to 16 years old, between 2002 and 2007, according to WKRC.

The crimes happened while she babysat them at her homes in Mt. Healthy and Springfield Township.

Brooks will be sent to prison for five years under a plea deal. She was sentenced to seven years behind bars, but will be credited the two she has already spent incarcerated.

Under the deal, she pleaded guilty to four of the 15 rape charges stacked up against her. She had also been charged with three counts of gross sexual imposition.

Cincinnati Police Detective Dana Jones said she has been contacted by several other victims in a number of states.

'Although we have several victims on paper, following her arrest the case grew and was much bigger,' Jones said in court, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer.

The detective said many of the victims asked her to speak on their behalf in court.

'Some of the victims consider Mrs. Brooks family, so for them the trauma was deeper than the act,' Jones said. 'The trauma that they suffered is unlike anything I have ever seen.'

Brooks was a licensed foster parent in Ohio from July 1996 to December 2008.

She was let go in 2008 while she was investigated for sexual abuse

The charges were dropped and she was never charged, the Enquirer reported.
