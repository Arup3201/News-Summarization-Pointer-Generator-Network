Professor Gennadiji Raivich, 51, who ran a 'one stop shop' insemination service is alleged to have assaulted three women desperate to be mothers

A neuroscientist who claimed to have fathered 58 children while running a 'one stop shop' insemination service preyed on three women desperate to become mothers by sexually assaulting them, a court was told.

Professor Gennadij Raivich, 51, a perinatal neuroscientist at University College London, carried out home visits to women across the country - allegedly assaulting three of them during the insemination process.

The academic from Holborn, London, told one victim she had to repeatedly perform oral sex on him to obtain the sperm samples, Blackfriars Crown Court heard.

Raivich, who sometimes went by the pseudonym Frank Qualman, is also alleged to have told one woman her chances of becoming pregnant were increased if she orgasmed during the insemination process.

The man would take a
 'donation kit' containing a DVD player - which he watched pornography 
on - rubber gloves, a speculum and pipette to his visits, jurors heard.

Raivich is only qualified as a doctor in Germany, has never practiced medicine in the UK and is not 
registered with the General Medical Council, the prosecution said.

His
 service did not conform to the guidelines of the Human Fertilisation 
and Embryology Authority,
the court was told.

Raivich has pleaded not guilty to 
assault by digital penetration in relation to the first victim, one count
 of assault by penetration and sexual assault against another, and two counts of assault by penetration and two 
counts of sexual assault on  a third.

He
 also denies two counts of sexual assault against the third woman on 
January 31 last year and assault by penetration on the same date.

The court heard how all the alleged victims heard about Raivich's service via an internet forum.

Prosecutor Tom Wilkins said: 'Each 
complainant in this case is a woman who met the defendant through an 
internet forum dedicated to sperm donation.

'He provided a one stop shop for women who wanted semen. All were desperate to have a baby.'

'The defendant met these women in order to inseminate them.

'He took advantage of their desperation, his anonymity and informality by committing various types of sexual assaults upon them.'

'On the websites he advertises his 
services as a sperm doner and represents himself as a: ‘Medical doctor 
based in Central London’ providing a service called Intra-Cervical 
Insemination or ICI.'

The 
first victim saw Raivich on February 27, 2012 when 'wholly gratuitously 
and without warning' assaulted her the jury were told.

'Such was her desperation to have a baby she returned ten times to his Russell Square address.'

Blackfriars Crown Court heard how Raivich told one alleged victim she had to give him oral sex repeatedly in order to get a sperm sample. He told another she was more likely to get pregnant if she orgasmed during the insemination process, the court heard

He persuaded his second victim to give him oral sex so he could provide the sample - a service that he called: 'Artificial Insemination Plus'.

The prosecutor continued: 'She says she was faced with the ultimatum that unless she performed oral sex on him she would not get a donation. She was desperate for a baby and agreed.'

Raivich also groped her between her legs during the sessions.

Mr Wilkins continued: 'He told her an orgasm would help her conceive.

'She told him three or four times not to touch her there, but he went ahead regardless and now he says he can’t recall stimulating her in this way.

'He was not the altruistic donor, but someone who is sexually-motivated.

'She was desperate for a baby and returned a week later for a donation in return for performing oral sex on him and felt she had to put up with it, she had been trying for a baby for a year.'

The third victim was visited by Raivich at her home in Great Yarmouth and on the second occasion sexually assaulted her, jurors heard.

'He lifted up her t-shirt and groped her breasts. He says he checked her breasts to test her fertility.'

The trial continues.
