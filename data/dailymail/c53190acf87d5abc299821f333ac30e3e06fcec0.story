'Sandy understood better than almost anyone what the United way means and his enthusiasm, his wit and his affection for the club will be sorely missed.

'Our thoughts go out to Irene and his family at such a sad time.'

Former United star Norman Whiteside took to Twitter to express his condolences.

Sandy remained a keen supporter of the club and lent his full backing of new manager Louis van Gaal's appointment this summer.

When asked by Sportsmail if his father would enjoy Van Gaal's brand of football, Sandy Busby was effusive in his support of the Dutchman.

He said: 'Oh, I'm sure he would. I'm sure he would. And please God he does.

'This club is enormous, it's an enormous club. It's got a great support throughout the world and it would be great to see Mr Van Gaal succeed and I'm sure he will.

'From the way he's talking, he's going to play attacking football and that's all we want. It's what this club stands for.'
