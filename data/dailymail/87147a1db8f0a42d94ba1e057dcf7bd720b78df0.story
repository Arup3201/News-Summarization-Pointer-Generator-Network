A 911 call released today provides a dramatic account of a tragic joyride by an 8-year-old Arizona boy in his mother's car that ended with the death of his 6-year-old sister.

The caller followed the car up and down a main Phoenix road before it crashed, causing minor injuries to the 8-year-old driver.

‘I'm driving and it looks like next to me there are these two little kids driving a car,’ said the caller, who identified himself as Rudy de la Cruz. ‘They're in a red car and it looks like two little kids, and they're driving like recklessly. They're all over the lanes and not stopping.’

Six-year old Aaliyah Felder was killed in a crash after she and her 8-year old brother took their mother's car out

At about the same time, the children's
mother called 911 in a panic to report someone had taken her two older 
children and her car was gone.

‘My car's been stolen and my kids have been taken,’ Glendolyn Bell tells dispatchers.

The sobbing mom is heard begging for help from neighbors and then discovering her spare key is missing.

The
two siblings inexplicably took their mother's car after she had fallen 
asleep and drove recklessly for approximately 30 miles before swerving 
head on in to a pole.

Six 
year old Aaliyah Felder was pronounced dead at the hospital the next day
as a result of injuries she sustained from not wearing a seat belt in 
the crash.

Phoenix police Sgt. Steve Martos said there's nothing to indicate the children's mother would face any charges in the Wednesday night crash.

‘There's really no criminal element to any of it,’ Martos said. ‘From mom's standpoint, there's nothing to indicate any neglect or abuse. From the kid's point, he's 8 years old so his mental state is not culpable.’

The mother bathed the children Wednesday night, put them to bed, and then went to bed herself. A half-hour later, her mother apparently came to their apartment and Bell discovered the children missing.

Meanwhile, de la Cruz was following the red Hyundai down a nearby main thoroughfare for about three miles, reporting to the dispatcher as the young driver drifted into oncoming traffic.

‘It's a red car and it looks like they've already hit a few things, actually, the bumper's messed up, there's like scratches in the back,' he says. ‘Oh my God, OK, they almost hit somebody, they're swerving out of control right now.’

The car later pulled into a
convenience store, and other drivers are heard honking their horns as 
the boy circled back and began heading back toward his home.

De la Cruz was reporting their progress the whole way, alternately coached and praised by the female dispatcher.

‘You're doing a great job, OK? I just want you to stay on the phone with me, OK?’ she said.Then, a squad car intercepted the sedan, and de la Cruz gave a tragic play-by-play.

‘OK, they're pulling them over, they turned on their lights right now. ... OK. Ohhhh, man.’

‘Did the boy stop for the police?’ the dispatcher asks.

‘Yes, yes they stopped. He just crashed right now.’

‘The little boy crashed?

‘Yes.’

The crash happened just three blocks from the family's apartment. Six-year-old Aaliyah Felder later died from her injuries.

A makeshift memorial on a tree near the crash site was set up by family and neighbors

The
mother ran over after seeing the police activity and was visibly 
distraught after discovering her children were in the car, Martos said.

‘It was a horrible and tragic moment for her,’ he said.

The
children were discovered missing after their grandmother passed by the 
house shortly after 9.30pm and noticed the front door was open, the 
Phoenix Police Department told 3TV.

She alerted the children's mother and soon they discovered together that the family car was gone.

Their mother frantically called 911 saying, 'My cars been stolen and my kids have been taken.
My door was unlocked and my door was locked when I went to sleep. My 
key was gone out of my purse, my purse was in my room with me,' tapes obtained by FOX 10 reveal.

Believing the children to have been kidnapped police caught up with the car, at which time the 8-year-old driver swerved into a pole and crashed, killing his sister.

After the crash the children were rushed to hospital where 6-year old Aaliyah was pronounced dead

The accident occurred just a quarter of a mile down the street from the family's home, 3TV reported.

The
two kids, still wearing their pajamas were rushed to the hospital where
Aaliyah was eventually pronounced dead and her older brother still 
remains under doctor's care having broken his ankle, FOX 10 reported.

According
to family members the boy, who has not yet revealed why he took his 
mother's car, may need surgery to recover from his injuries.

The children's family told reporters that they are rallying around the mother in this difficult time.

The children's aunt Felicia Sumlin fought back emotion as she tried to speak about her niece, 'Aaliyah ... I'm not ready to talk about it, Sumlin told FOX 10.

Aaliyah's cousin Zakeeyah Habeel was still reeling from the news as she talked to reporters, saying, 'It was just really a shock... it's 
something I'm still dealing with. As a family we are coming together and
supporting her [the mother] and just making sure she has everything she
needs.'

Felder's family (her memorial shown here) is coping with her death and say they are just 'shocked' by what happened

Family members and neighbors have put out donation jars in convenience stores around the city to help cover Aaliyah's funeral costs.

The driver who first called in the incident was also shocked and devastated to learn about the little girl's death.

'It's heartbreaking to hear that one of them didn't make it, it's just heartbreaking,' Cruz said.
