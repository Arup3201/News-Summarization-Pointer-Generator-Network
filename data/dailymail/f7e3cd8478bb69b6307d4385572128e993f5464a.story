Her tales have enchanted generations of English children and now Beatrix Potter is set to win another fan - baby Prince George.

The Duchess of Cambridge has decorated his nursery with characters from Beatrix Potter's classic children's book, it has emerged.

While Kensington Palace officials are said to have suggested antique furniture as more befitting a future king, Kate had her heart set on a Beatrix Potter theme.

Classic tales: The Duchess of Cambridge, pictured holding Prince George as she leaves St Mary's Hospital in London with husband Prince William, is believed to have chosen a Beatrix Potter theme for her son's nursery

And her mother-in-law Camilla took her side - insisting the nursery should be decorated to Kate's liking.

A source told The Sun: 'Camilla has experience in dealing with the "old grey men". She put her foot down, saying it should be Kate's choice.'

The pair are said to have become very close since Kate became pregnant with her first child George who was born on July 22.

The source added that the Duchess loves how Camilla treats George like any grandchild who 'wees, vomits and does everything babies do'.

With help from her mother-in-law, 31-year-old Kate is believed to have ordered that the nursery be decorated with characters from Beatrix Potter's books.

Popular: Peter Rabbit, depicted eating radishes, is likely to be one of the Beatrix Potter characters adorning Prince George's walls

One of her most popular characters who is likely to adorn the Prince's walls is Peter Rabbit.

The Tale of Peter Rabbit and his sisters Flopsy, Mopsy and Cotton-tail was first published more than 100 years ago but is still one of the most popular children's books today.

Other famous characters include Jemima Puddle-Duck, Mrs Tiggy-Winkle, Tom Kitten and Miss Moppet.Â 

It has been speculated that kate and her husband Prince William are likely to have used the same design company that created nurseries for William himself, his brother Harry and their cousins Beatrice and Eugenie.

Dragons of Walton Street in Knightsbridge specialise in handmade furniture painted with characters from Beatrix Potter, bears, flowers or fairies.

Home to a prince: Kensington Palace officials felt that antique furniture in the nursery would be more in keeping with the style of the property, pictured, but they were overruled by Kate and her mother-in-law Camilla
