Twins born via caesarean section minutes after a car crash that killed their mother have been released from hospital.

Ashton Hughes was driving home from a doctor's appointment in Spartanburg, South Carolina on January 6  when she ran into the back of a stopped SUV.

The 19-year-old, who was seven months pregnant and had her 11-month-old daughter Dixie in the car, was conscious after the crash but complained of pain to her abdomen. She was taken to hospital where her twins - a boy and a girl - were born.

The young mother suffered internal bleeding and sadly passed away after briefly holding her children, her devastated family revealed after the crash.

Tragic: Their mother, Ashton Hughes (pictured with her fiance Zack Jennings) died from her injuries following the c-section but saw the babies before she passed away. They will now be brought up by Zack

But the twins have now been released from hospital and will be brought up by Ashton's fiance Zack Jennings, with help from his mother and Ashton's family, Fox Carolina reported. 

Ashton Gailann Jennings, named after her mother, was born weighing 2lb 12oz, while Brantley Wayne Jennings was 3lb 2oz.

The babies stayed in intensive care at Spartanburg Medical Center for around 12 weeks.

It is thought the babies survived because they were delivered so soon after the crash, doctors said.

They are now doing well and visited their grandfather Eric Hughes on Sunday.  

Ashton's mother, Misty Fink, told WYFF shortly after the crash that her daughter lost too much blood during the emergency delivery. Her cause of death has not yet been determined.

After his daughter's death Eric Hughes said: 'It just hurts my heart so bad. I wish that I could take her place any day.'

He added that he was relieved her babies survived, including her toddler Dixie, who was in the back of her car at the time of the crash and only suffered a few minor scrapes,The State reported.

'That's the best part about this,' he said. 'I'm thankful for them being here, but totally saddened by her being gone. The only thing I know we can do is pray and hope for the best.' 

Ashton had recently left her job at Chick-fil-A in Duncan to focus on bringing up her children. Zack worked as an assistant manager at the same Chick-fil-A.

A former co-worker described Ashton as 'one of the sweetest people I've ever met'.  

Her family said she loved to wear camouflage clothing and chose a casket for her lined with camouflage material. 

The Spartanburg County Coroner's Office and S.C. Highway Patrol are still investigating the crash to determine what happened.

Eric said he believes his daughter was distracted before driving into the back of the SUV, which had stopped at a traffic light. Its driver was not injured and the SUV was able to be driven from the scene.

After the crash, she was able to talk and complained of pain to her stomach, likely from the steering wheel, airbag or seat belt, which she had been wearing.

Friends  raised more than $2,300 for her funeral costs and children on a gofundme page.

The last post, written two months ago, read: 'The family is very thankful for every penny that is donated to help with the cost of the funeral plus this is helping towards the beautiful twins that will have to stay in the hospital for another six to eight weeks.'
