She said: 'The interiors were specially designed around the beautiful contemporary art works so as to merge art and property together.

'A person who loves art will appreciate the time and dedication it has taken to create such a unique place to live in the heart of Paris.'

The 2,744 sq/ft property boasts features grand open-plan living spaces, a large kitchen and breakfast room and three big bedroom suites complete with walk in dressing room and en-suite bathrooms.

The traditional exterior gives no hint to the modern art stashed inside

The furniture is equally modern, offsetting the art on the walls 

The top-of-the-range kitchen wouldn't look out of place in a high-end restaurant 

Natural stone and wood has been used throughout and blended with man-made materials.

The entrance hall was created with large concrete slab flooring, with each slab weighing 100kg (15st 10lb) and bespoke wavy Corian doors which cost £2,500 each to make.

In the living space there are bespoke cabinets, wood flooring, fireplace and a dining area perfect for entertaining.
