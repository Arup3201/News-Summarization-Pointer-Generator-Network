Ferrari driver Abdul Salam, who clocked up 48 points on his driving licence, outside Oldham Magistrates' Court

A Ferrari driver who clocked up to 48 points on his driving licence has been fined more than £1,300 for making false statements to obtain insurance.

Abdul Salam, 31, from Oldham, Greater Manchester declared that he had a full UK licence when applying for insurance to drive his Ferrari in February, 2012, despite his licence being revoked on September 30, 2009.

Salam was found to be driving on the invalid insurance when he was pulled over by a police officer who spotted him driving not wearing a seatbelt.

Gary Logan, prosecuting, said that officers checked the licence and found that he had 48 points at that time, however the number of points varied during the course of the investigation with some records stating Salam had around 27 points.

The Government's penalty point system means that if a driver accumulates 12 points in three years they will be disqualified.

The Institute of Advanced Motorists has previously blamed failures to communicate between the courts and the DVLA - particularly when drivers clocked up repeat points over a short time - for problems in the system.

According to the DVLA it routinely contacts the courts when notified that a driver has reached the 12 point threshold and it remains up to the court whether to reopen the case.

Salam pleaded guilty to the charge of making a false statement to obtain insurance at Oldham Magistrates' Court yesterday on what would have been the third date a trial had been set for and the 10th listing at court.

Salam, a self-employed businessman, pleaded guilty on the basis that he did not know about the penalty points or the fact that his licence had been revoked when he applied for insurance, a basis of plea not accepted by the Crown.

Jonathan Holt, defending, argued that Salam had not meant to mislead and, while the statements were false, he did not know them to be false at the time he made them.

However the law, which dates to the late 1950s, stipulates that the offence is one of strict liability, meaning a defendant can be guilty of the crime without having a guilty mind or knowledge of making a false statement and sentencing was carried out accordingly.

Research last year revealed that 7,000 drivers on the road have 12 points or more - and one woman has clocked up a record 42 penalty points - yet still has a licence.

It has raised questions in the past about how some motorists have been able to get away without stricter punishments.

However drivers who break the law will have their licence 'endorsed' with penalty points - the amount can vary depending on the seriousness of the offence.

Points will stay on the licence for at least four years and in some cases its 11 years.

New drivers can have their licence revoked if they get six points in the first two years of passing their test.

To remove expired endorsements, a postal application must be made for a new one.

The insurance, from The Policy Shop, cost Salam £1,800 when it was taken out in February, 2012.

The court also heard that Salam's car was later seized by Greater Manchester Police under Operation Wolverine, a scheme which targeted unlicensed and uninsured drivers in Greater Manchester, and Salam paid in excess of £13,000 for insurance to reclaim the car.

Salam, who has already been banned from driving for two years following a separate driving case in February, 2013, was fined £875, ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £87 as well as costs of £400, making a total of £1,362.

Speaking about how Salam had managed to accrue 48 points on a licence a DVLA spokeswoman said it is up to the courts to decide when a driver is disqualified.

She said: 'DVLA's role is to record the information provided by the courts.

'The courts are able to use their discretion to decide whether or not to disqualify a driver.

'In January it was reported by The Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM), the UK's largest independent road safety charity, that a man from Liverpool had been allowed to continue driving despite clocking up 45 points on his licence, beating the previous record of 42 points.'
