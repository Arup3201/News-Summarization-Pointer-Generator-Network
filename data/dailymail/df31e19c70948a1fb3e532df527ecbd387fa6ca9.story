An eco-warrior and reality TV star has been sued amid claims that he secretly sank a boat he had borrowed and blamed its demise on Japanese whalers.

Paul Watson, star of Whale Wars, is accused of sabotaging the show's Ady Gil boat to gain more publicity for his life-long battle against whaling and to raise more funds.

The 62-year-old is being sued by the vessel's owner Ady Gil who loaned the boat to the crew and cast of Whale Wars.

A lawsuit was filed by Mr Gil on Monday at an LA court seeking $5million in damages from Mr Watson, who is a co-founder of Greenpeace and head of the Sea Shepherd Society.

Mr Gil, a Los Angeles-based millionaire businessman, contends that the boat only had damage to the nose after it was rammed by Japanese fisherman in 2010 and could have been repaired.

According to TMZ, Mr Watson had the boat sunk 'under the cover of darkness'. Watson resigned from his role as head of the Sea Shepherd society this week.

The civil lawsuit adds to the woes of Mr Watson who is at the center of a legal battle to have him extradited to Costa Rica to face a 2002 attempted murder charge.

The charges stem from an incident 
where Watson and the team from Sea Shepherd allegedly endangered the 
lives of a fishing boat crew in 2002.

Watson has said that the team spotted a Costa Rican fishing boat hunting for sharks in Guatemalan waters.

The U.S.-based Sea Shepherds has a history of waging aggressive campaigns to protect whales, dolphins and other marine animals.

A sixth season of Whale Wars is expected to be made by Discovery and appear on the Animal Planet channel.

Watson was previously charged with assaulting a police officer during a 1980 protest of Canadian seal hunting. His second arrest came in 1993 when a Norwegian court found him guilty in absentia for tampering with Cuban and Spanish fishing boats.
