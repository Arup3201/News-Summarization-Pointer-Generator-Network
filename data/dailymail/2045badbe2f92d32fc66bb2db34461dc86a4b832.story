New Celtic signing Jo Inge Berget is looking to qualify for the Champions League following his move to the Parkhead club.

The 23-year-old Norwegian international completed a six-month loan deal from Cardiff on Monday and went straight into the Hoops squad heading for Poland for the first leg of their Champions League third qualifier against Legia Warsaw on Wednesday night.

Former Molde player Berget, who played for Parkhead boss Ronny Deila at Stromsgodset, said: 'It happened pretty fast. I heard a couple of days ago that Ronny was interested and I am really happy that it worked out.

'I played for him for a year and a half, I know him well and he knows me.

'He wants to play football, entertaining football, the same as me so hopefully it will be a good match.'

Berget made two appearances for Cardiff after switching to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side in January - playing just 72 minutes across back-to-back home defeats - but now he is hoping to revive his career under his former boss.

'I have been in the qualification before but have never played in the Champions League so hopefully I will be able to go there.

'I know it (Celtic) is the biggest club in Scotland, one of the biggest clubs in Great Britain and hopefully we will get to the Champions League.

'That is the goal for the club and it should be a goal for the club as big as it is.

'This is a great opportunity for me, it is a great club and I hope it works well.

'It is up to me. It didn't really work out for me in Cardiff, I didn't play as much as I wanted to, but hopefully it will turn around here.'
