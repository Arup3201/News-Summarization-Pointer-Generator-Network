The heart-warming journey of two grandmothers who had never flown before has been captured on film as they took to the skies for the first time in a private jet.

The two women, from the Netherlands, required some serious preparation before the journey, with one taking a rollercoaster ride to prepare for being airbourne while the other attempted to calm her nerves by taking a flight simulator ride.

An Bernaards, 71, had a serious fear of flying while Ria Van den Brand, 78, had never had the opportunity to fly because her husband had a fear of heights.

However, they have now taken their first plane trip in style, travelling by private jet from Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport to Barcelona.

Before the journey, An had revealed a deep-seated fear of flying.

She said: 'You wouldn't get me in one of those for any amount of money. I will just take the bus.'

Just before her 72nd birthday however she decided to take part in the trip with Vodafone Firsts.

She said: 'If I don’t do this now, I never will. Sometimes opportunities come by in life that you just have to take.'

Ria, on the other hand, had only travelled with her late husband who had a fear of heights.

Ria and An accepted Vodafone's challenge of taking their first-ever flight together, sharing an experience that left them close friends

She found a new travel companion when she was partnered with An through the programme, which helps people do remarkable things for the first time.

She said: 'I’ve now got this opportunity, but otherwise I don’t think I would have ever flown. This is so exciting.'

An and Ria's flight was captured on film as they marvelled at the beauty of the view from the jet's windows and enjoyed the Champagne on offer.

On an emotional videocall at the end of the flight, An tells her husband: 'It was a lot of fun. I really enjoyed it and the other lady’s so kind. It’s just like a dream.'
