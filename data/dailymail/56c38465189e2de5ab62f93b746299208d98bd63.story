The Australian Federal Police were left red-faced after it was revealed sensitive information relating to criminal investigations had been publicly available for a number of years on parliamentary websites.

Specific information relating to the targets of investigations, the reason why they were being monitored, their communications, addresses and names of AFP officers not known to the public were some of the details published, according to The Guardian Australia.

It comes as the AFP and Federal Government look to drum up support for a data retention policy that would require telecommunications companies to keep a record of what customers did on phones and the internet for two years.

This data would be used by Australian law enforcement, anti-corruption and national security agencies to investigate crimes without a warrant.

In August, the Australian Federal Police were made aware of a privacy breach on parliamentary websites

An AFP spokesman said the information had since been removed after they were alerted to it on August 27.

The information was released as part of an answer to a parliamentary question on notice.

The spokesman told Daily Mail Australia they took these types of breaches 'very seriously' and had put into place steps to fix the problem after they had reported it themselves to the Australian Privacy Commissioner.

He said the AFP had also apologised to those who had been affected by the breach.

Targets of investigations, why they were being monitored, their communications, addresses and names of AFP officers not known to the public were some of the details published

According to the spokesman, the details were 'hidden behind electronic redactions within the document' but 'one phone number and an address could, under certain circumstances, be accessed'.

This is the latest in a series of blunders that have raised questions over the government's proposed data retention policy.

Most notably were Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Attorney-General George Brandis unable to clarify what data would be covered under the policy.

In a Sky News interview earlier this month, Mr Brandis was repeatedly asked to clarify what information would actually be captured.

'What you're viewing on the internet is not what we're interested in...what the security agencies want to know, to be retained, is the electronic address of the website that the web user is visiting,' he said.

But then Mr Brandis went onto to admit the data collected under the proposal would include the website.

After clarification, he explained that the sites visited by a browser would be retained, but not the content that was viewed on the site.
