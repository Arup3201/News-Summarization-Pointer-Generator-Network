Bill Clinton is wading into a hotly contested primary battle in Philadelphia to raise money for his daughter’s mother-in-law.

Marjorie Margolies is Marc Mezvinsky’s  mother and a former Congresswoman who is now running for the position two decades after she lost it.

Clinton, who is widely seen as the national Democratic Party's most potent fundraising force, will headline an April 10 fundraiser for Margolies in a restaurant at Philadelphia’s Warwick Hotel in Philadelphia.

Heading out onto the trail: Former President Bill Clinton will headline a fundraiser for his daughter's mother-in-law next month because she is running in a very competitive Congressional seat

Eying her old spot: Marjorie Margolies used to represent the Pennsylvania district that she is running to win now but she was voted out of office in 1995

It will cost supporters $1,000 to attend and $5,000 for a VIP reception.

Margolies officially became a member of the extended Clinton clan when her son married Chelsea in 2010 but the families have been connected for decades before that

'The vote': Back in 1993, Marjorie Margolies was one of the deciding votes that passed then-President Clinton's budget plan that increased taxes for the wealthy, and that caused her to be voted out

Margolies is trying to recapture the U.S. House seat that she lost in the 1994 election after casting a vote for then-President Clinton's budget proposal that increased taxes on the wealthy.

Margolies represented Pennsylvania's 13th congressional district from 1993 to 1995.

The incumbent, Democrat Allyson Schwartz, is running for governor and is not seeking re-election, leaving the seat open in 2015.

Three others have filed to run in the primary, including state senator Daylin Leach, state representative Brandon Boyle and Montgomery County physician Valerie Arkoosh, an obstetric anesthesiologist who had been a prominent advocate for President Barack Obama's signature 2010 health care law.

Margolies trailed in fundraising on December 31, the last deadline for candidates to report their campaign finances to the state.

The former NBC news reporter is now the president of Women's Campaign International, which she founded, and teaches at the University of Pennsylvania.

Her payouts form the charity came under careful scrutiny earlier in the campaign as she reported a six-figure salary from the gig.

As the charity has grown over the past decade, so has her salary as The Huffington Post reports it has steadily increased from $54,962 in 2002 to the highest point in 2011 when she took home $164,159.

Staying close: Margolies is the head of the Womens Campaign and presented an award to Chelsea in November 2013

Political family: Chelsea and Marc are seen with her mother Hillary Clinton at a White House function in 2013

Embarrassment of the in-laws: Edward Mezvinsky went to prison in 2003 after he plead guilty to 31 out of 69 counts of bank, mail and wire fraud where he defrauded investors of $10million

Her salary dipped last year- to $109,678 in 2012- and she did not take a salary in 2013.

Instead,
 the former Congresswoman, who served one term before being voted out in
 1995, has turned her attention back to the political arena as she is 
now actively campaigning in her own tight race against three other 
Democrats.

That isn't to say
 that she has cut ties to the charity, as she regularly posts updates on
 her Twitter account, publicizing events that they are holding.

One
 such recent evening came in November when she honored her famous 
daughter-in-law at the 15th anniversary bash for the charity.

She first ran for Congress in 1992, when she was known as Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky and was married to former U.S. Rep. Edward Mezvinsky, an Iowa Democrat who went on to become the party's state chairman in Pennsylvania. They divorced in 2007.

Edward Mezvinsky pleaded guilty in 2002 to bilking investors of more than $10million after he lost millions to African con artists pitching pyramid-type schemes.

Federal prosecutors said he boasted of his close relationship with Bill and Hillary Clinton and his son's then-friendship with Chelsea at Stanford University.

Her ex Edward Mezvinsky pleaded guilty in 2002 to bilking investors of more than $10million and they divorced in 2007 when he was still in jail
