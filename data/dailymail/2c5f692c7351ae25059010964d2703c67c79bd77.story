The Ohio mother who allegedly beheaded her three-month-old baby has been released from hospital and booked into jail on aggravated murder charges.

Deasia Watkins, 20, said nothing as she appeared handcuffed and in a yellow jumpsuit before a Hamilton County judge on Friday morning. Her bond was set at $500,000.

A grand jury will hear evidence in the case on March 26 and will decide on an indictment.

She is accused of decapitating her daughter Janiyah at her aunt's College Hill home on Monday morning before placing the knife in the child's hand and going to bed.

After her family found the grisly scene, Watkins, who had previously been ordered to stay away from the child after being hospitalized with psychiatric problems, was taken to hospital for evaluation.

In court: Deasia Watkins, who has been charged with aggravated murder in the beheading death of her baby daughter, said nothing at her first court appearance in Hamilton County, Ohio on Friday

On Thursday evening, she was released and taken to Hamilton County Jail. 

While she was under guard at Deaconess Hospital, Hamilton County prosecutor Joe Deters said that she was not talking to authorities.

'She's like a zombie,' he told WCPO. 'We're hoping to get her some medication so she can begin talking.

'Until she gets in front of some doctors and talks, it's going to be very difficult to know what her motivation was. No matter what the motivation was, no one is going to be able to explain this.' 

Watkins gave birth to baby Janiyah in December and was diagnosed with postpartum psychosis in January after police responded to a report that she was screaming in her apartment.

She was ultimately ordered to keep away from the child, who was handed over to her aunt, and family services caseworkers said they believe Watkins may not have been taking her medication, which could have caused delusional thinking.

Deters said it is believed Watkins moved in with her aunt about a week before the murder.

On Monday, the aunt's son dropped his children off at the house so they could catch the bus and a five-year-old boy entered the home and found the murdered baby on a kitchen counter.

Janiyah had been stabbed at least 15 times across her body and had a fractured arms, the coroner revealed.

The five-year-old boy ran outside to get his father, who then woke up Watkins' aunt, and together they called 911. 

'Somebody please send the police!' the aunt can be heard begging in the chilling 911 call. 'My niece killed our baby! Please! Help me!'

Overcome with emotion, she is unable to speak and her son takes the phone. The 911 dispatcher presses him for details about what happened. 

'Lady, the baby is on my mom's kitchen counter with its head smashed,' the man says. 'Can you please just send the police as fast as you can.'   

When the dispatcher pushes for more information, he says: 'Look, lady. I don't want to describe the scene. The [scene] is very, very bad, alright? The little baby's head is open. Like, open open.

'I'm not going in there to touch nothing, because I don't want to mess nothing up. I'm not going in there to look, because I've already seen it. But it's very violent. It's a very violent scene.' 

Police arrived at the College Hill home to find the decapitated baby and Watkins in bed.  

Watkins gave birth to her daughter in December and the baby's father, James Brown, told WCPO she 'just started acting different' about a month after the birth.

He said she had been 'acting crazy lately, speaking of demons', according to a court document. 

Shock: Janiyah's father, James Brown, said his girlfriend started acting differently a month after the baby's birth. He had also been ordered to keep away from the child, who authorities said was neglected

Tragedy: Janiyah also had multiple stab wound to her face and a broken arm, authorities have said

On January 24, police responded to a report of her screaming and the baby crying at their home. 

Watkins appeared to be under the influence of marijuana and refused to let go of the child, court documents said. But Janiyah was taken by emergency personnel after Watkins passed out with her eyes open.

Friend Chris Gulley was also at the apartment at the time and told WCPO that Watkins was calling him and Brown the devil. 

'She kept saying we were sinning so much, we didn't realize we were sinning,' Gulley said. 'We need to come to the light and see what God wanted us to do and all that.'

She was hospitalized briefly and diagnosed with postpartum psychosis. Doctors declared her unsafe around the child unless she took prescribed medication, court documents state. 

On March 6, a juvenile court magistrate the girl to be taken from her mother for the child's protection and placed in the custody of Hamilton County Job and Family Services.

Brown, whose paternity has not been established, was also ordered to stay away from the child when the court found both parents were neglectful.

Social workers checked on the baby girl once a week - at least 10 times in total - and warned relatives to keep Watkings away from her before the murder, the Cincinnati Enquirer reported. 

Deters said at a press conference on Tuesday that family services had done their jobs 'but you don't have the resources to be in the house 24/7'.

He added that he wasn't sure anyone else would be charged. The aunt may be needed as a witness, he said.

WCPO reported that Watkin's only previous brush with the law was a fine for disorderly conduct.
