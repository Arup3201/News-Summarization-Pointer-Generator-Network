Meghan Hellrood is organizing a boycott of school lunches at D.C. Everest High School in Wisconsin

A Wisconsin high school student is leading a boycott of school lunches to protest new nutrition rules and calorie limits that she says are leaving her classmates still hungry. 

Meghan Hellrood of D.C. Everest High School in Weston, Wisconsin, is the latest student to take on the new school lunch regulations championed by First Lady Michelle Obama. 

'We have calorie regulations now on our lunches, so students cannot take as much food as they used to be able to, but the whole Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act put restrictions on calories. The whole point of it was to get healthier foods, but instead of healthier foods, we’re getting smaller portions of more processed foods,' she told WSAU radio. 

School cafeteria staff are even required to limit access to barbecue sauce and mayonnaise packets, she says. Students are only allowed to take one sauce packet because use more could exceed the 850 calorie lunch limit imposed by the federal law. 

Miss Hellrood has launched a movement at her school to encourage all students at her school to bring a bag lunch on November 13 and refuse to pay for school lunch. 

She has also organized an effort to make sandwiches for the students who receive free or reduced lunches.

Miss Hellrood hopes that the one day boycott will cost the school $3,000 and send a message about the Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act

She estimates that if all 1,500 students at her school participate, it will cost the school district $3,000.

'Help us send a message to Washington. By packing your own lunch, you will help show our school district that we are unhappy with the so called Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act,' she says on a Facebook page she started to spread awareness of the campaign. 

The social media campaign has 344 likes, as of Monday afternoon. 

Miss Hellrood is only the latest high schooler to protest the lunch requirements. They've been the subject of parody videos and social media campaigns since the new lunch rules went into effect in 2012. 

'I’m 4-foot-11 and weigh 90 pounds and I want more food. I can’t image the senior guys on the football team,' Miss Hellrood told WSAU.

First Lady Michelle Obama championed the school lunch requirements that lowered calories to just 850 and put other restrictions in place

Many students, she says, end up bringing food to school to supplement what they're getting in the lunch room. 

The 2010 Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act was meant to reform school lunches to offer students more variety and healthier meals. The idea was to remove high-fat, high-sugar foods from cafeterias to combat childhood obesity. 

However, the law also cut calories. Previously, school lunches had to provide a minimum of 825 calories. The new restrictions set calories at 750 minimum to 850 maximum.
