ITV has been accused of stoking a fake controversy after last night's climax to Coronation Street's controversial assisted suicide storyline saw the terminally ill character Hayley Cropper end her own life – without help from husband Roy.

Critics accused the ITV ‘publicity machine’ of using a sensitive and emotive issue to generate higher ratings, with some questioning whether the soap had contributed to the debate at all.

Other critics have raised fears the episode could prompt copycat suicides by vulnerable viewers, particularly because it was shown before the 9pm watershed.

Sparking debate: ITV has been accused of stoking controversy after Coronation Street character Hayley Cropped, pictured right, took her own life without the help of her husband Roy, pictured left

In last night’s episode, the much-loved character explained to Roy her determination to die by her own hand rather than succumb to a lingering death from pancreatic cancer.

She warned Roy not to touch the glass containing a lethal cocktail of painkillers to avoid implicating himself in her death.

Then, resisting his efforts to take the glass from her hand, Hayley died in Roy’s arms leaving him consumed by grief.

However, the episode had been billed as a contribution to the ‘right to die’ debate, brought into the public consciousness by cases such as locked-in syndrome sufferer Tony Nicklinson, who fought for assistance to end his life in the courts.

Last night Vivienne Pattison, director of Mediawatch-UK, said: ‘This demonstrates why soap operas are such a bad way to conduct debates on matters of public policy.

The episode has instead been billed as a contribution to the 'right to die debate' rather than the assisted suicide debate

‘They turn it into a highly-charged, emotional issue, but fail to engage with the important details.

‘ITV’s
 huge publicity machine has stoked up the debate around this episode 
well in advance to get people talking about it and to get people to tune
 in. But in fact the storyline is not quite as billed. In the end, it 
was not about assisted suicide at all.’

An ITV spokeswoman said the second episode last night, which culminated in Hayley's death, pulled in a peak audience of 10.6 million viewers.

More than 100,000 tweets were sent about the programme, with around 8,000 messages being tweeted every minute towards the end of the episode.

Actress Julie Hesmondhalgh, who has played Hayley, the soap’s first transsexual character, for 15 years, has already been criticised for using the episode to promote her own views.

Miss Hesmondhalgh, who is a member of the British Humanist Association, revealed she has ‘strong views’ in favour of assisted dying, and said ‘it’s hard not to be in favour’ of the terminally ill deciding to take their own lives.

She added: ‘I wouldn’t want to live in that pain and anguish or see my family and friends go through it. I’ve always really understood Hayley’s decision.’

The show’s executive producer Stuart Blackburn also defended the plot, saying: ‘We’re not advocates for Hayley’s decision and her belief that she had a right to choose a time of her dying in any way, shape or form.

‘Will it influence people? I don’t know. People may have the discussion and talk about it. We have a right to have that discussion.’

Hayley’s final scenes, watched by millions last night, have reopened the national debate on euthanasia ahead of a House of Lords hearing on the issue in May.

Labour peer Lord Falconer, who hopes to allow patients to end their lives voluntarily with his Assisted Dying Bill, reacted by calling for Parliament to ‘resolve the mess’ of current legislation which makes it a crime to help others take their lives.

Assisted suicide is legal in Switzerland, the Netherlands and some US states.

Since the Dignitas assisted dying centre opened in Switzerland in 1998, more than 180 terminally ill British people have  travelled there to end their suffering on their own terms.

Ex-soldier Reg Crew, who had motor neurone disease, became the first Briton to publicly go to Dignitas in 2003. His wife Win was threatened with legal action when she returned home but was not charged.

Along the cobbles of Coronation Street, life goes on. As Hayley Cropper was slipping away in the arms of her grief-stricken husband last night, her neighbours were flirting, bickering, fixing cars and minding the shop – much as ever.

The BBC’s EastEnders would have milked this storyline for every last teardrop, with one of its trademark two-hander episodes. ITV has tried that format a couple of times, with the camera trained on two actors in a room for the full half-hour, but it’s too melodramatic for Corrie.

Instead of a claustrophobic death for Hayley, shut away in the flat above the cafe with her devoted Roy, she first saw her friends and family one last time. She was fervent and weepy. But if they gave it a second thought, they blamed her emotional state on the medication.

Only Roy knew that Hayley was determined to take an overdose that evening, choosing to end her life rather than suffer a drawn-out death from incurable pancreatic cancer.

Meanwhile, brassy Gloria was batting her eyelashes at Dennis, Chesney was working up the courage to ask Sinead to move in with him, and Tyrone was looking everywhere for his baby daughter’s toy kangaroo.

The first of the double episodes opened with Roy bringing his wife breakfast in bed for the final time.

The scene didn’t last more than 20 seconds, as though to stay longer would be intrusive. Even in Hayley’s final moments, we saw her take only the first gulp of the painkillers, before the camera cut away.

This was the right approach. Transsexual Hayley might once have been a bloke, and a father at that, but she was no drama queen. She wanted no fuss. She even ironed Roy’s best shirt before she lay down, to make sure he looked his best at the funeral.

Julie Hesmondhalgh played it beautifully, conveying a sense that her body was in spasms of agony but her mind was calm. To see that pain was upsetting, because she was so convincing. Anyone who has helplessly watched a loved one suffering  torments at the end of a long illness will know how true her performance was.

David Neilson as Roy was equally affecting. Never an articulate chap, he was speechless with grief for much of the second episode, but his eyes were eloquent. Roy wanted to cry, but he couldn’t. Millions of viewers did it for him.

With such sensitive acting, this ought to have been an unequivocal triumph, but the show’s executive producer, Stuart Blackburn, has tarnished it in his eagerness for ratings. A faux controversy was whipped up in the weeks before the broadcast, about the ‘right to die’ debate and euthanasia.

In fact Hayley killed herself, with no help from anyone. Her husband even tried to take the tumbler of drugs from her hand at the last moment, but she was determined. Once she had swallowed the draught, he held her as she died.

If Blackburn had really wanted to tackle the debate over assisted suicide, he should have let Hayley linger a couple more weeks, until she was too weak to hold the glass herself. Roy could have lifted the drugs to his wife’s lips.

That really would have been controversial television, but the producers apparently lacked the courage for it.
