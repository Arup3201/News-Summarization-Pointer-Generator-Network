It could be a godsend for games fans - and make iPhone games even more addictive.

A newly unearthed patent application reveals plans for a spring loaded home button that pops up to become a joystick when needed.

The 'multi-function input device' shows an iPhone or iPad home button that changes into a small joystick for gaming.

It is believed the button would retain the current Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and that a single click would cause it to pop up and transform into a slightly elevated thumb joystick.

A simple push of the elevated home button back into a flush position with the body of the iPhone would return it to its original state when done gaming, the patent diagrams show.

'The multi-function input device is operable in at least a first mode and a second mode,' the patent says. 

'In one example, the multi-function input device may have a button mode and a joystick mode.' 

Diagrams included in the application show a very low-profile joystick. 

'The input device head may not project outward from the surface when not being used as a joystick, thus avoiding compromising aesthetic appearance of the electronic device, preventing potential damage to mechanisms utilized to project the input device head, and/or keeping the input device head out of the way when not being utilized as a joystick.'

Apple also admits that for some games, a touchscreen is not ideal.

'Touch screens (which may be well suited to applications such as an Internet browser application) may offer some advantages for operating game applications on portable devices, but they may also have shortcomings. 

'For example, a user's finger may need to cover part of the screen while the user is controlling the game. 

A simple push of the elevated home button back into a flush position with the body of the iPhone would return it to its original state when done gaming, the patent diagrams show.

'This may interfere with the user's ability to see what he is controlling and/or other portions of the game display. 

'Additionally, a touch screen may be unable to provide tactile feedback and the ability to provide tactile feedback during a game may enhance the user's game experience. 

'Some gamers hold the opinion that realistic game play cannot be fully experienced without joysticks and/or tactile buttons.'
