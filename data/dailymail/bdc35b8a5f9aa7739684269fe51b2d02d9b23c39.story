The widow of Chris Kyle, the SEAL subject of the blockbuster American Sniper, is scaling back her public appearances to promote the film following backlash.

Taya Kyle was cutting back on interviews following criticism from filmmaker Michael Moore and others, The Star Tribune reported.

The movie, starring Bradley Cooper as Kyle, Sienna Miller as his wife and directed by Clint Eastwood, has already earned $90.2million at the box office, setting a record for the highest-earning January opening.

The film tells the story of Mr Kyle, a sniper, who was credited with saving hundreds of American lives by making 160 confirmed kills,  the most in U.S. military history.

After retiring from the military, Kyle was shot dead at a gun range in Texas in 2013 by a soldier he was trying to help who was suffering from severe PTSD.

Despite the box office success and Oscar buzz, the subject matter of American Sniper has drawn critics including director Michael Moore, who tweeted on Sunday: 'My uncle was killed by a sniper in WWII. Only cowards would do that 2 him, others.'

The filmmaker later backtracked after an onslaught of criticism. Moore claimed on Monday that he was not talking about either Kyle or the film, pointing out the fact that he didn't mention either directly.

'Hmm. I never tweeted 1word bout AmericaSniper/ChrisKyle. I said my uncle killed by sniper in WWII; only cowards would do that 2 him, others,' Moore said. 

One of those who strongly criticized Moore was Medal of Honor recipient Dakota Meyer, Fox reported. 

Meyer, a Marine vet who was awarded the medal for his bravery during the Battle of Ganjga in Afghanistan, said of Moore: 'I'm sure that his grandfather who died serving this country is rolling over in his grave knowing that his grandson is using him to justify him calling U.S. service men cowards.

'I’d be willing to bet that at some point during his grandfather’s service, he was watched over by U.S. snipers, and probably had his life saved more than once by U.S. snipers during the war.'

However, despite the film's defenders, it appears that representatives for Mrs Kyle and the movie were somewhat squeamish about putting her in front of the press. 

The co-chair of a St Louis synagogue speaking event told The Star Tribune that Mrs Kyle's reps 'are cutting off her press. They will allow us to schedule some interviews but only related to promoting our event'.

She added: 'Because of this, any questions related to the current murder trial [involving the disturbed U.S. veteran who killed Kyle] and the Ventura trial are off the table.'

The email referred to the defamation lawsuit brought last year by former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura against Kyle's autobiography. Ventura was awarded $1.8 million in July. 

A federal jury decided that the 2012 best-seller written by Kyle defamed Ventura in its description of a bar fight in California in 2006.

Kyle wrote that he decked a man whom he later identified as Ventura after the man allegedly said the Navy SEALs 'deserve to lose a few'. 

The case is currently on appeal to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

Kyle's killer, U.S. Marine Corps vet, Eddie Ray Routh, is set to stand trial in February. 

Filmmaker Michael Moore appeared to criticize the movie and Kyle in a tweet on Sunday - but later backtracked on his remarks 

Earlier this week, Mrs Kyle paid tribute to audiences who have flocked to cinemas to watch the film. 

Taya Kyle has thanked movie-goers for 'being willing to watch the hard stuff' in the war drama and says she often cries thinking about the support she has received.

With the film of his life tipped for Oscar success, Mrs Kyle, had thanked audiences in a post on Facebook.

She wrote: 'I am overwhelmed with gratitude and my heart is full. American Sniper has broken records, which follows such an honest path of Chris's life.

'We never expected anything and were always in a moment of stunned silence at the response from all the beautiful people in this world.

'I also just want to cry and cry and honestly have today. I think that's what happens when I don't have the words. The only thing I can say is thank you. Thank you for the love and support of our military.

'Thank you for being willing to watch the hard stuff and thank you for hearing, seeing, experiencing the life of our military and first responders. 

'I put them together because the battlefields may be different but the experience is the same on many spiritual levels.'  

The film, which is based on Mr Kyle's autobiography of the same name reveals not only how he became so successful, but also how the trauma of fighting in Iraq never left him.

In the post she also gave an emotional tribute to her late husband and admitted that she still misses him every day. 

She added: 'To Chris: I miss you and yet I know you are here. 

'You are the man who I couldn't have even dreamt of because you were/are better than I could have dreamed, the love of my life, my friend, partner and the man who laughed with me through the pain and found joy in the smallest and best parts of life.

'I hope you see the love and good we will do together in whatever God has planned for the rest of the journey. Thank you for loving me.

'You are with me and I love you is all I can say. I can only say it simply, because there aren't words enough to express it all.'

The film tells the story of her husband who was raised in rural Texas and started out working as a cowboy. 

He applied to join the SEALs but was turned down because a rodeo accident had left him with metal pins in his arms.

However, in the late Nineties, the unit relaxed its entrance requirements and Kyle was put through the fearsomely tough selection and training regime.

In 2003, he was deployed to Iraq where he made his first long-distance kills even though he had not been trained as sniper.

Spotting his obvious talent, the military sent him to SEAL sniper school, where he was taught how to perform warfare's loneliest and most controversial job.

In 2004, Kyle was posted to Fallujah, west of Baghdad and a major battleground of Iraqi insurgency, and it was during the battle for that city where he first made his mark.

However, it was in 2006 in Ramadi, a city in central Iraq, that Mr Kyle gained his nickname as 'The Legend' from his fellow SEALs.

One day, while positioned on a roof, Kyle watched a moped coming down a street. Riding it were two men, one of whom dropped a backpack into a pothole.

Realising that it contained an improvised explosive, Kyle took a shot at the speeding moped from a range of 150 yards. The bullet hit one of the riders, passed through him, and hit the other.

In 2009, after four tours of Iraq, Kyle retired. He had not only shot more of the enemy than any other American sniper but had also gained himself a chestful of medals, including three Silver Stars for gallantry.

In February 2013 he and a friend, Chad Littlefield, took 25-year old Eddie Ray Routh to a remote shooting range in Glen Rose, Texas.

Before they reached the range Routh, 25, shot both men dead and stole Kyle's customized pick up truck. 

Routh's family claimed he was suffering from PTSD and had mental issues. His trial on two murder charges begins in February.
