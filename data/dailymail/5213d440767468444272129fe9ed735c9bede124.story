An ex-Marine has been charged in the brutal murder of a young Long Island mother whose raped, stabbed and beaten body was found last month in the woods after she had gone missing.

Dante Taylor, 19, was picked up Friday by U.S. Marshals and Suffolk County Police on an unrelated warrant for first-degree rape and charged in the killing of 21-year-old Sarah Goode.

Authorities are not sure how the two met, but sources told WABC they may have met at a house party only days before Goode went missing and Taylor went on the run.

Taylor was found by authorities in Vero Beach, Florida and taken back to Long Island for his Saturday morning arraignment.

Prosecutors told the courtroom that Taylor raped and savagely stabbed and beat the woman to death - a piece of metal was found in her skull and her car was covered in blood.

Dozens of Goode's relatives cried in the courtroom while hearing the details of the killing, and some had to be physically restrained and removed from the chamber, News 12 reported. It was the first time they found out how Goode died.

'Hope you burn in hell,' Nick Giannetto, Goode's brother-in-law, shouted at the accused killer before being taken out of the courtroom, according to Newsday.

Taylor's bloody palm print was found on the car and his semen was found on the tortured and killed woman, the prosecutor said.

He was also linked to the crime through CPS tracking on his cell phone, and phone records showing the pair exchanged multiple phone calls the night she went missing, Newsday reported.

Taylor was also charged during the same hearing with the attempted rape at knifepoint of another woman back in 2011 - he was only 16 when that crime happened. That victim was fortunate enough to escape.

He pleaded not guilty to all charges.

It has also been revealed that Taylor joined the Marine Corps on September 23 or last year only to see the 'end of his active service' on April 22, according to Newsday.

A military spokesperson declined to discuss the circumstances surrounding the end of Taylor's time in uniform.

A friend of Goode's who also once had a romantic relationship with Taylor called him a 'violent person' and said 'he just wasn't normal. We were scared of what he might do because of his temper.'

The shocking details come almost one month after Goode, mother to a four-year-old daughter, vanished after spending a night out with friends.

Her partially decomposed body was discovered about a week later after an intense search effort involving police, family and dozens of volunteers.

Police first found Goode's 1999 BMW parked a mile away from her house on Fire Avenue near new London Avenue in Medford.

The car showed obvious signs of a struggle, investigators said.

Detectives found Goode's body within a mile of where her car was found earlier this week, nearly a mile from her home.

Family and friends had been leading the search for Goode and called the situation a 'nightmare.'

'I feel horrible for them and her 4-year-old daughter,' said family member Joseph Miller to PIX11.  'She loved her daughter so much, I know that.'

Goode worked as a medical technician and lived with her mother and her daughter.

NBC
 reports that a woman who lived a mile away  on the street where the car
 was found noticed that the license plate was bent and that the numbers 
were obscured. Thinking the car might have been stolen, she reported it 
to police.
