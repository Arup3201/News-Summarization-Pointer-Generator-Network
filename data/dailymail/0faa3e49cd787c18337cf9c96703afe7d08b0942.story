Felix Magath has taken the extraordinary move of making his Fulham players return for extra training after the season has ended.

Fulham were sent crashing into the Championship after a woeful season which saw the club drop into the second tier for the first time in 13 years.

Magath has compounded his players pain by making them report for training when many were expecting to head off on holiday following an arduous nine months in the Barclays Premier League.

And there's worse news to come for the beleaguered west Londoners, as their German manager has informed the players training will last until at least the end of the week - but could go beyond.

There has been some good news for Fulham as owner Shahid Khan says he is prepared to invest heavily this summer to restore the club to the Premier League at the first attempt.

The American billionaire - who also owns NFL franchise Jacksonville Jaguars - said: 'This is not about balancing the books.

'I am 
committed and we are going to do whatever to get them back to the 
Premier League. It (relegation) is not what we wanted, but it is 
reality. What we have to do is build it for the long haul.

'We
 are going to do whatever it takes to put the best team on the field. I 
have talked to Felix and what we want to do is what is in the best 
interest of the team.'

Meanwhile,
 Lewis Holtby - who joined on loan from Tottenham in January - believes 
the potential of the young players at Craven Cottage will help them 
respond positively to relegation.

Germany midfielder Holtby had a limited impact on loan from Tottenham, playing 13 games, scoring once, but insisted he 'cried with the club' when Fulham's demotion to the Championship was confirmed at Stoke.

'It was fantastic to play for this club and they will always stay in my memories,' Holtby said.

'Even though we went down I had a fantastic time here. I cried with the club when we went down and Fulham will always be a part of me.

Not part of the plan: Shahid Khan says he will invest to help Fulham return to the Premier League as soon as possible

'The fans took to me and I took to them. I'm a person who plays with passion and desire.

'When you play for a club, even on loan, you have to give 100 per cent dedication, you can't just go and take the money.

'You have to play football with heart and the Fulham fans deserve that.'

Fulham reached the FA Youth Cup final, losing in agonising fashion to neighbours Chelsea, and Holtby believes youth can provide the foundation for future success.

'This club has a brilliant academy,' he said.

'A fresh start can see a lot of young blood come in and that can only bode well for the future.'
