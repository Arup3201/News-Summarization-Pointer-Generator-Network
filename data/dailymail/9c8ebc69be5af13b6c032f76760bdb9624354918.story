The owners of the Superman brand have  banned a tortured boy's memorial from featuring their logo because they 'don't want to be associated with child abuse', it emerged today.

Five-year-old Superman fan Jeffrey Baldwin, from Toronto, Canada, died in tragic circumstances 12 years ago when he was starved to death by his grandparents.

He had been locked in a cold, urine and faeces-stained bedroom in the home of his grandmother, his Catholic Children's Aid Society-approved guardian, and wasted away to the weight of a baby.

Following an inquest earlier this year, Ottawa IT worker Todd Boyce was touched by the words of Jeffrey's father Richard in his testimony, and started raising money for a statue of Jeffrey.

Mr Baldwin had said: 'He wanted to fly. He tried jumping off the chair. We had to make him stop. He dressed up (as Superman) for Halloween one year. He was so excited. I have that picture at home hanging on my wall. He was our little man of steel.' 

Mr Baldwin added that before his teenage parents lost custody of Jeffrey to his maternal grandparents the little boy was very energetic and loved the superhero.

Mr Boyce's appeal to raise money online was successful, and the statue was designed and the model created, with Jeffrey wearing his favourite costume.

But, Mr Boyce says, when DC Entertainment found out, the comic book giant refused him permission to use the iconic diamond-shaped 'S' logo. 

'It was important for me because I really felt I wanted to capture the photograph of Jeffrey wearing his Superman costume and have it as close to that as possible,' Mr Boyce told CBC News.  

'Basically they didn't want to have the character of Superman associated with child abuse. They weren't comfortable with that.'  

DC Entertainment is refusing to allow the Superman logo to adorn the memorial statue of Jeffrey, who loved the superhero during his short life before his grandparents starved him to death

Mr Boyce told  CBC News he was angry and emotional when he first learned of their refusal, but after subsequent conversations with people at the company and their lawyers, he softened his stance.

'(I) realized that the most important thing is to have a fitting monument for Jeffrey, that it's about him,' Boyce said. 'To be fair to DC I don't think they wanted to say no. I think they gave it serious thought.' 

Mr Boyce said the design will be changed to have a 'J' on the chest rather than the 'S' of the Superman logo.

The model of the statue is complete - except for the letter change - and is just now waiting  to be cast in bronze. Mr Boyce is hoping to unveil it in September.

One of Jeffrey's sisters has chosen a poem to be engraved on a bench that will be part of the memorial, Mr Boyce said.

It begins with the line 'I wish heaven had a phone so I could hear your voice again.' 

Jeffrey's grandparents were convicted of second-degree murder in 2006 had custody of Jeffrey and his three siblings.

Two of them were treated relatively well, the inquest heard, but one of his sisters was subjected to the same conditions.

The difference between Jeffrey and his sister was that she was allowed to go to school and the daily snack she received there probably saved her life, the inquest heard.

MailOnline has approached DC Entertainment for a comment.
