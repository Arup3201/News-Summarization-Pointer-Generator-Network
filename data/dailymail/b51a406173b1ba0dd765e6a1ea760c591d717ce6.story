A suspected New Jersey drug dealer was apparently hoping to capitalize on the ongoing Ebola outbreak when he named his product after the deadly virus.

Barnabas Davis, 47, who goes by the moniker ‘Hammer,’ was arrested Monday for allegedly being in possession of 633 wax fold of heroin labeled 'Ebola.'

Ralph Stocco, of the Toms River Police Department, clarified that the drugs did not actually contain the pathogen responsible for some 4,500 deaths, but rather the name was part of Davis' marketing strategy.

Marketing strategy: Investigators seized 633 wax folds, similar to the ones pictured here, containing heroin and stamped with the name 'Ebola' 

‘Different dealers have different potencies and products. Many times they are labeled with catchy phrases,’ Stocco told the New York Daily News. ‘In the past we have had Bin Laden, Hello Kitty, D.O.A., Twin Towers, 911, gumball, pow, etc.’

Police acting on a tip descended on the Ramada Inn hotel on Route 9 in Toms River Monday, where Davis allegedly had been peddling his product from a rear suite, NJ.com reported.

During a search of his room, officers came upon hundreds of wax folds containing heroin, 40 grams of crack cocaine and 'trademark' stamps that read 'Ebola.'

Mr Davis is currently being held in jail on $300,000 bail.

According to the latest numbers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Ebola so far has claimed the lives of 4,555 people, the vast majority of them in West Africa.
