Florida beach-goers were stunned by the sight of a local fisherman dragging a huge hammerhead shark to shore.

Ryan Bolash, 21, and friends dragged the 13-foot beast onto the beach after they hooked it near the pier at Lauderdale-by-the-Sea.

Bolash wrestled the thrashing shark out of the Atlantic Ocean and onto the beach, and the whole spectacle was filmed and photographed by thrilled onlookers.

The main reason for dragging the beast ashore wasn't glory, though, it was to cut the fishing line.

Bolash told reporters that it's important to cut the line as close as possible to the creature's mouth so that it didn't get caught on something and injure the shark.

'In order to release the fish on the pier, you would end up having to cut the line, and there would be about 15 foot of line tangling, hanging down from the fish, which would get caught on a reef, could end up killing the fish in the long run,' Bolash told WHNT.

'It is an amazing fish, when they are that big they are old, they are amazing creature, I donâ€™t know why anyone would want to hurt them.'

After the line was cut, the men dragged the hammerhead back to the sea and watched it swim away.

'It's an achievement. It's cool to catch something that big and have a picture and show everyone and be like, "Look at what I caught!" It's the ultimate catch,' said Bolash.

Photographs aren't the only memory Bolash has from his close encounter with the huge hammerhead.

He received a few scratches on his leg that he calls 'shark burn,' from the shark's rough skin, reports WHNT, but otherwise Bolash - and the hammerhead - was uninjured.

Tourists and locals alike were amazed at the sight of the shark.

'It's a very big experience for us,' Canadian tourist Jenie Rivest told reporters. 'For sure we are going to tell everybody in Montreal that we saw this.'

According to a local who works on the pier, the last time a 13-foot hammerhead was caught in the area was in the 1960s.
