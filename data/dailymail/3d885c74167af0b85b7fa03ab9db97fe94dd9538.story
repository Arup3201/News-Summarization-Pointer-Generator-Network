A closely guarded lifestyle of jet-setting, two private maids and home bursting with couture will be uncovered in a glossy new coffee table book.

But this isn't the biography of an A-list supermodel (though it may as well be) but a tome all about Karel Lagerfeld's cat Choupette.

The Chanel creative director's beloved pet, a three-year-old Siamese, lives a kind of lifestyle usually reserved for a queen, and fans get only snippets from her social media accounts.

Now all is to be revealed in the new book; Choupette: The Private Life of a High-Flying Fashion Cat.

Choupette: The Private Life of a High-Flying Fashion Cat is released on September 15 for £12.95

While just the cover has been released so far, the fluffy white feline is to be immortalised into a mammoth 128 pages.

Readers will gain exclusive insight into Choupette's little (and large) luxuries such as her personal maids (she requires not one but two, one for night and one for day).

Her favourite, Madame Françoise, keeps a daily diary of the feline's every move. She provides 'essential advice' in the tome, alongside Choupette's personal vet, Madame Horn.

The
 book, out in September, features sections on diet, beauty, healthcare, 
fashion tips, secret loves and pet hates, as well as an insight into her
 jet-setting life by the side of the Chanel creative director.

This will be accompanied by personal photographs Karl has taken of her and images from her various modelling stints alongside supermodels like Linda Evangelista.

And Choupette's look of feline eyes and a pale complexion must definitely be in.

She has just finished her latest modelling campaign, shot by Karl, for the yet-to-be-seen holiday makeup collection for Japanese brand Shu Uemura, called 'Shupette' (think furry fake lashes).

The cat owns her own iPad and eats her little cat meals at the table (from
 custom-made Goyard or Louis Vuitton crockery).

Karl told Marie Claire: 'Miss Choupette loves Latin but hates opera, but I only listen to music if she is awake.

'Her grooming routine is a lot of work. She has two maids because she doesn’t like to be alone. They do all the brushing - she's beyond spoilt and sleeps on the back of my bed.'

The cat boasts more than 37,000 Twitter followers and 16,000 on Instagram, where she muses her accomplishments and various #fauxpaw committed by the world of fashion (she's not a fan of crop tops or ombre).

To further cement Choupette's celebrity the new book dedicates a section to an 'affectionate look at the cat as the muse to artists and writers, both past and present'.
