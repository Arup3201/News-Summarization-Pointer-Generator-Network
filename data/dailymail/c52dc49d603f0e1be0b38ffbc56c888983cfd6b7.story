Furious St Louis cops have demanded that NFL players who made the 'hands up, don't shoot' gesture in solidarity with Ferguson protesters are punished by their superiors.

Officials from the St Louis County Police Association - the police union for the area including Ferguson - said that it was 'profoundly disappointed' in the five players who made the gesture.

Officers released an angry statement saying the players 'ignored mountains of evidence' vindicating Darren Wilson over the shooting of 18-year-old Micheal Brown, for which a grand jury recently declined to indict him.

Solidarity: St. Louis Rams wide receiver Stedman Bailey (12), wide receiver Tavon Austin (11), tight end Jared Cook (89), wide receiver Chris Givens (13) and wide receiver Kenny Britt (81) put their hands up to show support for Michael Brown before Sunday's game against the Oakland Raiders at the Edward Jones Dome

The statement, given to the KSDK TV station, described the gesture, which protesters have adopted across the nation, as: 'tasteless, offensive and inflammatory'.

It is a reference to witness accounts of the shooting, some of which claim Brown was raising his hands in surrender when he was shot 12 times by Wilson. The accounts have been disputed. 

Attack: The police association, whose president Gabe Crocker is pictured above, said the gesture was 'unthinkable' from a hometown team

One member of the association was quoted saying: 'It is unthinkable that hometown athletes would so publicly perpetuate a narrative that has been disproven over-and-over again.'

The gesture was made by five members of the team: wide receiver Stedman Bailey, wide receiver Tavon Austin, tight end Jared Cook, wide receiver Chris Givens and wide receiver Kenny Britt. 

The statement went on: 'All week long, the Rams and the NFL were on the phone with the St. Louis Police Department asking for assurances that the players and the fans would be kept safe from the violent protesters who had rioted, looted, and burned buildings in Ferguson.

'...As the players and their fans sit safely in their dome under the watchful protection of hundreds of St. Louis's finest, they take to the turf to call a now-exonerated officer a murderer, that is way out-of-bounds, to put it in football parlance.

The lengthy message concluded by saying: 'The SLPOA is calling for the players involved to be disciplined and for the Rams and the NFL to deliver a very public apology' and threatening to rally police in their condemnation of the team.

A Rams spokesman said on Sunday that the team was not aware the gesture had been planned before the game against the Oakland Raiders.

Symbolic: The gesture also made another appearance after the Rams' Tre Mason, left, scored a touchdown and was congratulated by Kenny Britt

The St. Louis Police Officers Association is profoundly disappointed with the members of the St. Louis Rams football team who chose to ignore the mountains of evidence released from the St. Louis County Grand Jury this week and engage in a display that police officers around the nation found tasteless, offensive and inflammatory.

Five members of the Rams entered the field today exhibiting the 'hands-up-don't-shoot' pose that has been adopted by protestors [sic] who accused Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson of murdering Michael Brown. The gesture has become synonymous with assertions that Michael Brown was innocent of any wrongdoing and attempting to surrender peacefully when Wilson, according to some now-discredited witnesses, gunned him down in cold blood.

SLPOA Business Manager Jeff Roorda said, "now that the evidence is in and Officer Wilson's account has been verified by physical and ballistic evidence as well as eye-witness testimony, which led the grand jury to conclude that no probable cause existed that Wilson engaged in any wrongdoing, it is unthinkable that hometown athletes would so publicly perpetuate a narrative that has been disproven over-and-over [sic] again."

Roorda was incensed that the Rams and the NFL would tolerate such behavior and called it remarkably hypocritical.

'All week long, the Rams and the NFL were on the phone with the St. Louis Police Department asking for assurances that the players and the fans would be kept safe from the violent protesters who had rioted, looted, and burned buildings in Ferguson.

'Our officers have been working 12 hour shifts for over a week, they had days off including Thanksgiving cancelled so that they could defend this community from those on the streets that perpetuate this myth that Michael Brown was executed by a brother police officer and then, as the players and their fans sit safely in their dome under the watchful protection of hundreds of St. Louis's finest, they take to the turf to call a now-exonerated officer a murderer, that is way out-of-bounds, to put it in football parlance,' Roorda said.

The SLPOA is calling for the players involved to be disciplined and for the Rams and the NFL to deliver a very public apology.

Roorda said he planned to speak to the NFL and the Rams to voice his organization's displeasure tomorrow. He also plans to reach out to other police organizations in St. Louis and around the country to enlist their input on what the appropriate response from law enforcement should be.

Roorda warned, 'I know that there are those that will say that these players are simply exercising their First Amendment rights. Well I've got news for people who think that way, cops have first amendment rights too, and we plan to exercise ours.

'I'd remind the NFL and their players that it is not the violent thugs burning down buildings that buy their advertiser's products. It's cops and the good people of St. Louis and other NFL towns that do. Somebody needs to throw a flag on this play.

'If it's not the NFL and the Rams, then it'll be cops and their supporters.'

Wide receivers Tavon Austin and Kenny Britt came out together first, with the move obscured by a smoke machine in the upper reaches of the stadium.

Stedman Bailey, Jared Cook and Chris Givens - all of whom are black - then came out and stood together with arms raised.

After Tre Mason scored on an 8-yard run to make it 45-0 in the fourth quarter, the gesture made another appearance when he and Britt raised their hands together.

There was disruption around the country from other Ferguson protests today as well, after a group of demonstrators blocked off the I-395 highway in Washington, D.C., Sunday afternoon.

A human chain blocked the road in both directions for about 40 minutes, according to the Washington Post.

Calls for justice continued to be made from the Missouri town itself today, as Rev. Al Sharpton gave a service at the Flood Christian Church, of which Brown's father, Michael Brown Snr, is a member.

Activism: Across the street from the stadium, about 75 protesters gathered in the second half as about 30 police wearing riot gear watched from a safe distance

There have been riots, looting and buildings burned in Ferguson since Monday’s grand jury verdict. 

Across the street from the stadium, about 75 protesters gathered in the second half as about 30 police wearing riot gear watched from a safe distance.

Protesters chanted ‘Hands up, don't shoot!’ ‘No Justice, No Football!’ ‘This is what Democracy looks like,’ and ‘We're here for Mike Brown.’

The Rams had additional security measures in place for the game, including armed personnel from the National Guard. The team has wanded fans outside entrances all season. 

Earlier in the week there had been reports that the game might be moved because of the protests. 

In the end, the game remained in St. Louis giving the Rams the opportunity to show a sign of solidarity to the hometown crowd.
