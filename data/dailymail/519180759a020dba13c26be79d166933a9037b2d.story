Philip Hobbs and stable jockey Richard Johnson walked away from Cheltenham after turning the Open Meeting into a virtual closed shop.

Combined success with Garde La Victoire in the Greatwood Hurdle and the Arkle Trophy Chase Trial with Dunraven Storm took Hobbs’ tally to six in the 19 races run over the three days.

Johnson took his haul to seven when winning the concluding Listed Bumper on Steve Gollings-trained Definitly Red.

Johnson’s feat – he was only eligible to ride in 17 of the races - matched that of AP McCoy, who won seven races at the meeting in 2001.

Hobbs, who had sent out Balthazar King, Champagne West and Bold Henry to win on Friday plus Golden Doyen on Saturday, couldn’t quite match the achievement of Martin Pipe – he produced seven Open meeting winners in 2001, 2002 and 2004 – but his reward is to be sitting at the top of a trainers’ championship table most expected to be a three-cornered fight between Paul Nicholls, Nicky Henderson and Jonjo O’Neill.

Hobbs said: ‘Before the meeting started I said I would settle for two winners and Richard said three. To have six is phenomenal.

‘I could not have imagined it in my wildest dreams. It was borderline whether we ran today’s two winners because we thought it might be too soft for them. We will enjoy it while we can.’

The Arkle Chase could prove the ultimate aim for 7-2 winner Dunraven Storm, who held off favourite Vibrato Valtat on whom jockey San Twiston-Davies seemed to overdo the waiting tactics.

After his heroics for new boss Paul Nicholls on Saturday when winning the Paddy Power Gold Cup on Caid Du Berlais, it will not be the last blip on a learning curve and Nicholls must equally acknowledge he has invested for the future in a young talent.

Hobbs, whose understated demeanour often means his successes do not achieve the attention they deserve, brushed off any notion Garde La Victoire may be a Champion Hurdle outsider by saying the 10-1 winner was ‘about 20lbs’ below the standard required.

Action more pertinent to that race took place at Punchestown where Hurricane Fly proved there is still life in his 10-year-old legs with third consecutive win in the Morgiana Hurdle when beating reigning champion Jezki two and a half lengths.

Alan King’s Uxizandre, under an exquisite front-running Barry Geraghty ride, landed the Shloer Chase. Hills make him 16-1 for the Queen Mother Champion Chase.

But attention in that division is of stars trying to overcome problems.

We should find out after a bone scan on Tuesday if reigning champion Sire De Grugy has suffered a hairline pelvic fracture or less serious muscle pull while Nicky Henderson said 2013 title holder Sprinter Sacre, sidelined last term by a fibrillating heart, will have a racecourse gallop before being given the go ahead to run in the Tingle Creek Chase at Sandown on December 6.

Henderson said: ‘He has had his MOT and heart-wise everything is fine.'
