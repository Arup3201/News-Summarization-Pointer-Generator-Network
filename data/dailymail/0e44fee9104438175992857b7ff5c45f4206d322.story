Share orders worth over £380 billion were cancelled in Japan after a 'fat finger' trading error.

Orders for shares in 42 companies, which amounted to more than the size of Sweden's economy, were cancelled at 9.25am today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from the Japan Securities Dealers Association. 

The biggest order was for Toyota Motor shares at over £1.2 billion, representing 57 per cent of the company's outstanding shares.

Other companies involved in the off-exchange trading error included Honda Motor, Canon, Sony and Nomura Holdings, according to ibitimes.co.uk.

Off-exchange or over-the-counter trades are made directly between two parties without the stock exchange being involved.

Gavin Parry, managing director at Hong Kong-based brokerage Parry International Trading, told Bloomberg: 'It's not rocket science that there was a fat finger here, but it reopens the question about accountability.'

The trading errors commonly known as 'fat finger' is not new to Japan. In 2009, UBS mistakenly ordered 3tn yen worth of convertible bonds in Capcom.

In 2005, Mizuho Securities tried to sell 610,000 shares at 1 yen apiece, when it had intended to sell one share at 610,000 yen.

And in 2001, UBS mistakenly placed a sell order for 610,000 newly listed shares in the Japanese advertising giant Dentsu for 16 yen apiece, while the market price was 420,000 yen.
