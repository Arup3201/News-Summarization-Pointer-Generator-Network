These dramatic photographs show the streets of modern-day San Francisco torn apart by the after-effects of a violent earthquake.

Buildings are reduced to rubble, huge craters have opened in the debris-strewn roads and uncontrollable fires have ripped through homes.

Fortunately, these pictures are a clever amalgamation of images of the city today and after the devastating quake of 1906.

Foundations: Shoppers blithely cross the street while workers begin the monumental task of rebuilding a destroyed San Francisco

Breathtaking: Mr Clover returned almost 20 times to get the exact position and light right for this picture of the fallen Valencia St. Hotel

They were created by photographer Shawn Clover, a San Francisco resident who wanted to reimagine the traditional 'then-and-now' concept.

Mr Clover first selects a catalogue of historical photos and then takes new ones from the same spot, which he softly blends with the old.

Once he has usable images, he has to recreate the exact conditions in which the original was taken - from where the photographer was positioned to where the sun is in the sky.

I found that many of the original photos I planned to use were in fact unusable because the photographer was situated in a place where a building stands today,' he writes on his blog. 'Others now have trees blocking the view.

'My goal is to stand in the exact spot where the original photographer stood,' he adds. 'Doing this needs to take into account equivalent focal length, how the lens was shifted, light conditions, etc.

'I take plenty of shots, each nudged around a bit at each location. Just moving one foot to the left changes everything.

He added: 'I kept running into delays. In the case of the Valencia St. Hotel, I had to return to the scene on Valencia between 18th and 19th four times before I managed to get it right. There’s quite a bit of conflicting information of exactly where this building once stood.

'And just when I was about to wrap things up, my dad announced that he had unearthed a local magazine published in late 1906 loaded with earthquake-aftermath photos that I had never seen in any library or online collection.'

Photography was a common hobby by 1906 and thousands of photos have survived to this day. One photographer even flew his £46 camera on a kite to get aerial shots of the aftermath. Some colour photographs have even been found.

Fade out: Cheerful tourists pass by the Fairmont Hotel, which still stands, but is destroyed inside from the fires

Always prepared: Men pose in a tent city to house displaced residents while an armoured car turns left a corner

In ruins: Buildings fell, sinkholes in the streets opened up, railroad tracks bent, and collapsing bricks crushed cable cars during the disaster

The 42 seconds of intense shaking made building collapse, sinkholes in the streets open up, railroad tracks bend, and collapsing bricks crush cable cars.

Four-day-long fires were responsible for 90 per cent of the destruction, with more than 30, caused by ruptured gas mains, destroying around 25,000 buildings on 490 city blocks.

Many were started when firefighters untrained in the use of dynamite attempted to demolish buildings to create firebreaks, and the dynamited buildings themselves caught fire.

Mayor Eugene Schmitz put out an authorization for the federal troops and police to shoot and kill looters. Thousands of tents and temporary relief houses went up to house 20,000 displaced people.

Mr Clover has spent more than two years recreating the chaos in 1906 + 2010: The Earthquake Blend.
