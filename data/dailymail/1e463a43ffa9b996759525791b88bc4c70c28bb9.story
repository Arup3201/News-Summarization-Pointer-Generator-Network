'Scandal': Ben Stein, 69, penned a column describing beautiful women he met during a tour

Former Nixon speechwriter Ben Stein, best known for his role on 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off', has penned a bizarre essay about his 'crushes' on beautiful women he meets as he travels.

In a column for The American Spectator, the former New York Times writer, who has been married to attorney Alexandra Denman for 45 years, wrote about women he met on a recent speaking tour in California.

Among them were an 'absolute knockout young Eurasian woman', three adorable coeds', a 'beautiful cocktail party girl' and a 'breathtakingly beautiful middle-aged woman'.

After the column was published, the National Enquirer accused him of being in a 'sexting scandal' with one of the women - saying he asked her to be his secret girlfriend and sent her money - but he said she had gone to the tabloid simply because he refused to pay for an expensive hotel for her. He insisted that his wife knew about the women he met.

In the column, he wrote about a never-ending string of beautiful women he met as he traveled.

'My main obsessions in my life are my 
wife, my dog, my son and his family, my secret GF from Mississippi, and 
any beautiful girl I meet,' he wrote. 'I am like a teenager. I get mad 
crushes.'

He
 wrote that he had met an 'absolute 
knockout young Eurasian woman', who he learned was a former call girl. 
She asked him to help her become a writer - but he said there was little
 he could do.

After meeting, they texted daily before she revealed that she was 
pregnant by a man she'd had a brief relationship with.

Married: He has been married to attorney Alexandra Denman for 45 years and insisted that she always knows about the women he meets and speaks to. He said there was no sexting scandal

'I'll just be a single mom,' she texted him. 'Will you help me out?'

He wrote: 'I am so pro-life that I can never say no in these cases but I am worried about it.'

That same weekend, he went on to meet 'three adorable coeds', a 'beautiful cocktail party girl' and a 'breathtakingly beautiful middle-aged woman... with a figure that is close to unbelievable'.

It is this woman who is the subject of the 'sexting scandal' accusations, he said.

He wrote that he considered flying her to
 his hometown of Los Angeles to go out for 'a lovely dinner' with him 
and his wife - until she insisted on staying at the expensive Beverly 
Wilshire.

After they met she sent him photos of herself having root canal surgery and then a 
screen shot of her bill, which was $2,300, he said.

The Enquirer claimed Stein had texted, emailed and sent the woman flowers - and had even given her $900.

But he told the Enquirer: 'I didn't have sex with her! At my age, I don’t even know if that’s possible.'

Speaking to Business Insider, he added that the story had only surfaced because he made 'the unfortunate mistake of meeting a very
 vengeful human being who’s very angry that she did not get to stay at 
the Beverly Wilshire'.

Well known: He famously appeared in the 1986 movie, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, as Bueller's teacher

He added 
that he has been writing 'or at least 40 years about the interesting 
people I meet' and that his 'secret gf' line had simply been a joke.

But he admitted that he had communicated with the women after meeting them and did sometimes send them money.

'They don't even remotely have to be romantically involved with me for me to help them or communicate with them,' he said.

Still, he claimed that his wife knew everything about his flirtations and found the latest press coverage funny.

'We were joking that I'm probably the 
only person who's ever read 'A Monetary History of the United States' 
who ended up in the National Enquirer,' he said.
