Elementary, my dear Hamilton. So the demanding task of winning the Malaysian Grand Prix was made to look by the supreme  racing craft of the Briton chasing his second, life-defining, world title.

With victory secured in the suffocating heat of the Sepang track, Lewis Hamilton beamed on the podium as he was interviewed, bizarrely enough, by Sherlock Holmes, aka actor Benedict Cumberbatch.

But what looked like a piffling one-pipe triumph for a driver of Hamilton’s brilliance was a massive statement of intent in what, at this early stage of the season at least, is a private championship duel between the two Mercedes’ men, Hamilton and Nico Rosberg.

‘Strike One to Lewis,’ was the verdict
 of Jenson Button, the grid’s most experienced competitor. Yes, the 
Hamilton-Rosberg tally stands at a single race win each, but Rosberg’s 
triumph in Melbourne a fortnight ago was achieved after his garage-mate 
suffered early engine failure.

The
 statistic of relevance was the 17.3sec gap between Hamilton 
and Rosberg in second place. That is light years when two men, unimpeded
 by incident and without any apparent technical faults, are driving 
identical cars.

Hamilton, 
who was on pole, started impressively by moving to block Rosberg, who 
started from directly behind him in third. His advantage established, he
 merely purred into an ever-increasing lead.

Still,
 there was the heat, the fuel, the tyres to contend with. We heard how 
this season would serve-up ‘the hare and the tortoise’ races. Would 
Hamilton’s hare be caught? No chance. The absence of a safety-car period
 and no more than the merest  sprinkling of fleeting rain added a sense 
of inevitability as the 56 laps ticked by.

Lewis Hamilton shares the British record for number of pole positions with Jim Clark — he has 33 — but he doesn’t usually convert them like on Sunday. He has won just 13 times from pole, including only six victories from his last 21.

So
 Lewis, 17 seconds? ‘It’s massive,’ he said. ‘I can’t remember the last 
time I had a gap like that, particularly with a team-mate driving the 
same car. That’s  definitely a good feeling.

‘I
 learned a few things in practice but it’s a different thing learning it
 from applying it, but today I applied it and that’s why I blew him 
away.’

Hamilton’s win was 
the 23rd of his career, passing Damon Hill’s 22. That accolade went with
 his 33rd pole on Saturday, which made him the joint British record 
holder alongside no less a legend than Jim Clark. His perfect weekend 
was completed by his setting the fastest lap.

It
 is a delight to watch Hamilton at the wheel in this commanding form. He
 is simply the fastest man on the planet. As the paddock was being 
dismantled — next stop Bahrain on Sunday — he summed up his approach to 
racing.

He said: ‘My trainer
 was saying in the last few years, “If people could see that you’re 
always in bed early. Nobody sees that, and they say you’re less focused.
 And they say Sebastian (Vettel|) is more focused just because he’s 
getting results.”

‘I’m 
giving it everything. I’m only thinking about the championship. I’m 
thinking about winning. I’m living and breathing it, as I do every year.

‘In
 my driving style, I’m more mature. I’m starting to see the benefits of 
the mistakes, and the things I’ve said, or the things I’ve done, and I 
even noticed it today. I am more calculating in the race.’

Rosberg still
 leads the championship table. In fact, he can follow Hamilton home in 
the next two races and still lead the table. No wonder Rosberg seemed 
reasonably unperturbed afterwards. His confidence, apparently at an 
all-time high prior to the race, is far from being shot.

It
 is the contention here that the best seasons are shaped by a straight 
rivalry between team-mates. Think Mansell-Piquet, Prost-Senna, 
Alonso-Hamilton. Fireworks abounded. Are we in for a repeat treat?

Button’s
 thoughts are instructive. Even he, the most balanced of drivers, had 
the odd moment of friction with Rubens Barrichello’s side of the garage 
in his championship year of 2009.

‘It
 matters who the individuals are,’ he said. ‘Nico and Lewis are close as
 friends but one has won a world championship and the other hasn’t, so 
that might change things a bit between them. Looking at what Lewis did 
today is going to hurt (Rosberg) a little bit. He was super-fast.’

In other news, Vettel’s third place was a tribute to Red Bull’s infinite resource and sagacity.

It
 was impossible, though, not to feel some sympathy for Vettel’s 
team-mate Daniel Ricciardo. After being disqualified for an alleged 
fuel-pressure irregularity in Australia, he suffered a broken front wing
 after being released unsafely from the pit box. That cost him a 10sec 
stop-go penalty. He retired from the race and will still get a 10-place 
grid penalty under the new harsh regulations.

Fernando
 Alonso was fourth, showing that Ferrari could yet enter the fray as 
serious title  contenders when the European season starts in May.

As
 for Hamilton, the victor in the first Mercedes one-two since 1955, he 
said: ‘I’ve already made notes now and will go away the next  couple of 
days. There’s more to come.’ Stand by.
