William Thoms was born with profound hearing loss in his right ear and moderate hearing loss in his left

William Thoms is just like every other little boy. His mother says he 'loves to make noise'.

But only two years ago, the three-year-old could barely hear a thing after being born with profound hearing loss in his right ear and moderate hearing loss in his left.

Despite the long battle ahead of him, in which he has to attend weekly speech therapy classes and audiologist appointments, his mother Penelope from Caste Hill in New South Wales, told Daily Mail Australia that her son was lucky.

'We look at his hearing impairment as fortunate because he was born with it and we can help him at a young age,' Mrs Thoms said.

William is one of an estimated 3.5 million Australians who have some degree of hearing loss, according to Australian Hearing.

Mrs Thoms first found out about her son's problem within the first week of Williams birth when the hospital performed a number of Statewide Infant Screening - Hearing (SWISH) tests that brought back poor results.

'It was a bit of a shock,' Mrs Thoms said, due to having no family history of similar problem. 'We kept wondering "what kind of life is he going to have?"'

But before he turned one, William was fitted with a hearing aid on his left ear, and by the time he was nine-months-old he underwent surgery to receive a cochlear implant.

'With the implant and hearing aid, he can hear like a normal child. The second we had it switched on – 10 days after the operation - we could tell there was a great improvement,' Mrs Thoms said.

'He could hear all these different sounds, like planes overhead, so it was quite a fascinating process to watch,' His mother, Penelope Thoms, said of her son after he had his cochlear implant (pictured)

'Because he could already hear from his left ear through the hearing aid, we thought there would be not much of a reaction and it was a subtle reaction at first where he just had a curious look about him, but then after a week or two at home you really started to notice the difference.

'He could hear all these different sounds, like just our movements across the floorboards and planes overhead, so it was quite a fascinating process to watch him become aware of all these sounds.'

But it all can get a little bit too much for a little fellow, Mrs Thoms revealed, as she described a time that William refused to wear both his hearing aid and implant attachments.

'He would break down and throw a tantrum because he didn't want to have anything on his head and that was very hard because he changed completely. He was very snappy and negative and would get upset often because he couldn't hear.

'And then we just persevered one day and kept putting it on until he got used to it.

'We checked with his audiologist and it might have been something emotional he was going through because he didn’t have any ear aches and there was no sign of infection.'

Now, little William is more than happy to have his full hearing and only takes off his aids when he’s tired or feeling unwell, but according to his mother, that won't last.

'It's going to come; the day when I'm getting him in trouble for something and he just turns them off and says "But mummy,  I didn't hear!".'

The organisation is promoting Hearing Awareness Week, August 24-30, in which they hope to inspire the thousands of people with untreated hearing loss to seek help.
