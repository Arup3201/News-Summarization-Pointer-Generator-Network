If you're seriously considering proposing to your loved one in public, you might just want to watch this video first.

A hapless romeo gets down on one knee to ask his girlfriend to marry him, but she clumps him around the head with a busker's ukulele.

The cringeworthy video, shot in a shopping mall in Dubai, shows the man, described as an 'Indian teen', and the girl walk up to a group of buskers.

I most certainly won't: The moment the man's public marriage proposal 
goes disastrously wrong when his would-be bride clumps him round the 
head with a ukulele  

As the musicians begin a to play he takes a microphone and launches into a gooey speech saying: 'I have a very special message for a very special girl. This is where we met three months ago.

'You are my charm, you are my sweety pie, you are my cutie pie, my absolute everything, and I know you find this cheesy but I want everyone to know, you make me really happy.'

As a crowd gathers things start going badly for the man when a toy town-style mall train drives past, breaking the mood and the embarrassed girl mutters 'Oh my god everyone's watching.'

Here goes: The man, backed by a group of buskers, begins his proposal speech in a Dubai shopping mall

Popping the question: He drops down on one knee to ask the girl to be his bride as she begs him to stop

Blam: The furious girl swings the busker's miniature guitar catching the unwanted suitor around the head

Undaunted the man  continues: 'I have a little poem for you and I want everyone to hear this.

'When you smile, the whole world stops and stares for a while. And my heart ceases to beat and there is nothing else I seek except you.'

As he gets down on one knee the girl begs him to stop but he continues: 'And I Just have one question for you. You truly make me that happiest person on earth.'

Love hurts: The man lies in a crumpled heap on the ground before the girl storms off

But the girl simply cannot take anymore and she snatches the miniature guitar out of the hands of one of the buskers and whacks her suitor round the head with it sending him to the floor in a crumpled heap.

She then throws the instrument onto the ground and and storms off.

The clip has since gone viral on YouTube but there is a strong suggestion it could be a publicity stunt, not in the least because the mall train bears the advertising message 'not so sweet'.
