Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink's unveiling as the new manager of Burton Albion was delayed on Thursday after goalkeeper Dean Lyness suffered a suspected broken leg in the Dutchman's first training session.

The 42-year-old former Chelsea striker was half an hour late meeting the media at the Pirelli Stadium due to what he described as 'freak accident'.

'It was unfortunate, a collision with him and another player,' said Hasselbaink. 'Training went really well but that was a really negative incident.

Burton are Hasselbaink’s second job in management after he led Royal Antwerp to seventh place in the Belgian League last season but turned down a new contract to see employment in England.

He had previously worked as a coach at Nottingham Forest under his former Middlesbrough boss Steve McClaren who approached Burton on his behalf.

Hasselbaink, who replaces Gary Rowett, becomes only the third black manager in the Football League along with Huddersfield’s Chris Powell and Carlisle United boss Keith Curle.

‘I’m delighted to get this opportunity,’ said Hasselbaink, who also played for Leeds, Charlton and Cardiff. ‘My focus is to get success with this club who were really unlucky to not get out of League Two last year. We are going to try to push that on.

‘I’ve been looking. Antwerp offered me a new deal to stay but it wasn’t for me. I wanted to come to England because I have a young family who are still living here.

‘I see myself as a semi-English boy. I came here in 1997. I know how the English think and what they stand for. My kids go to school here so I see myself as a little bit English. I want the England national team to do well – not as well as Holland obviously!

‘Sir Alex Ferguson always said something really important – choose your chairman you want to work for. I think I’m lucky to be able to start my career in England here at Burton Albion.

‘All my managers have influenced me. I was fortunate working for a lot of good managers. You take something from everybody that you like and don’t like. You use it and make it your own, you don’t do exactly the same. I’ve been very fortunate in that aspect.

‘I’ve never played in League Two but there is a lot of talent and passion, and I like that. I’ve seen quite a lot of matches in League Two – Wimbledon and a few others – so I know what I’m getting myself into.

‘We want to put our own stamp on the team, our own philosophy. There will be a few things we want to change but it’s a stable club.

‘I want to give a little bit more entertainment. I’m a winner and that’s what I want to give to my players.

‘Pressure? What is pressure? We are always looking upwards. It’s possible to League One and that’s going to be our aim. If we don’t get that this year it’s not going to be a big problem. We always have next year.’
