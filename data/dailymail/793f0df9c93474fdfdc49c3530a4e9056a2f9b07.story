Football fan: Ed McGovern, headteacher at Stafford Leys Primary School, has taken two weeks off working during term time to travel to Brazil

Parents have attacked a primary school head teacher they say has taken two weeks off during term time to travel to the World Cup in Brazil.

Ed McGovern, 55, was allowed to take unpaid leave from 
Stafford Leys Primary School in Leicester due to 'personal reasons' after enlisting the help of his union.

The
 school has not confirmed the reason for Mr McGovern's absence but 
parents said they found out he had gone to South America for the World Cup.

A
 spokesman for the school said Mr McGovern has never previously made a 
request for leave of absence and his attendance record has been 
'exemplary.'

But furious parents said he should be 'setting an example', especially when they could be fined for taking their children out of school.

One even called on the head teacher to resign.

Businesswoman Carol-Anne Girvan, 42, whose two sons attend Stafford Leys Primary School, said: 'I think it's absolutely appalling.

'He is headteacher, he was refused permission to do this at first and had to appeal to his union I hear.

'He has a responsibility here for his pupils and he has neglected them.

'He is supposed to be setting an example to not only the students but for parents, who themselves cannot go to this kind of event. He ought to resign because of this.'

Parent Kiran Kaur added: 'I don't think it is right. We parents can't do it, can we, but he can go away when he wants. I think Ofsted should be taking a good look again at the school - his leadership should be in serious question now.

'I want to know why the governors and powers that be thought that this would be OK.'

Parents: Carol-Anne Girvan (left) said the head should resign while Jasvir Singh (right) said it was a 'disgrace'

Jasvir Singh, 41, whose has a son at the school, added: 'We only found out he was gone recently. I don't think that's right.

'I
 couldn't believe what I was hearing... It is a big disgrace and we 
should have been asked about this before he was allowed to go away.'

Parent Kiran Kaur said: 'His leadership should be in serious question'

Father-of-two Carlton Skeats, 44, 
said: 'Considering parents face fines for taking their children out of 
school this just reeks of double standards. It doesn't send the right 
message at all.'

And Zoe 
Gibbs, 28, whose two sons Harvey, six, and Oliver, eight, go to the 
school, said: 'They haven't told us anything really, it's a disgrace.

'But
 of course it has come out that he's gone to Brazil for the World Cup. 
If I were to take my son out of school I'm sure I'd be punished.

'When my son had tonsillitis he was off for two weeks and Mr McGovern wrote us a letter saying he had had too long off sick. If that's too long when you're genuinely ill then going on a jolly to Brazil isn't right.'

Other parents were more supportive of the headmaster.

Kerry
 King, 31, a full time mum with two children at the school, said: 'I 
don't see a problem with it. He is taking unpaid leave and it will not 
affect the children as he doesn't teach in class.

'I
 think people are just jealous that he can go and they can't, he's an 
exceptional head and should be allowed a one off experience.'

Veerpan
 Kau, 29, whose daughter attends the school, added: 'I think it is fine 
what he has done. He is not hurting the children - there is plenty of 
cover for him for just two weeks.'

But
 the Conservative MP for Charnwood, Stephen Dorrell, said: 'It is 
unprofessional and disappointing that the headteacher has not displayed 
professional leadership at this school.'

'Double standards': One parent said the school (pictured) had criticised her when her son was off sick

Mr McGovern's request for time off was originally rejected by governors following a row when the headteacher of another Leicester school was allowed to take a month off in term time to get married.

The decision however was overturned after the head appealed with the help of his union.

A school spokesman told MailOnline: 
'Requests for leave of absence for personal reasons can be made by staff
 in line with our school policy.

'Our
 leave of absence policy states that the Governors “will endeavour to 
facilitate requests for leave” and “will wherever possible seek to 
achieve for our employees a balance between home, work and leisure as 
part of our commitment to being an employer of choice”.

'Our
 headteacher has led the school with distinction for the past ten years.
 During that time the school has improved from being judged by Ofsted as
 having serious weaknesses to our most recent inspection earlier this 
year which showed that all aspects were at least good.

The headteacher is understood to have taken time off school to travel to Brazil for the World Cup (file picture)

A spokesman for the school (pictured), in Leicester, said Mr McGovern has never previously made a request for leave of absence and his attendance record has been 'exemplary'

'His attendance record over this period has been exemplary and he has never previously made a request for leave of absence.

'The request was for unpaid leave of 
absence for personal reasons which has been approved by the Governing 
body after careful consideration.

'We
 have made provision to ensure that during the period of this absence 
strong cover for leadership of the school is in place and standards of 
teaching and learning will remain high.'

Defending her son's decision, the headteacher's mother Shelia, 77, who lives in Birmingham, said: 'My son has put so much into education. Surely he deserves a break.

'Why shouldn't he go to Brazil, who knows what he will be able to teach the children when he returns.

'No one would make a fuss if he took time off to cut the lawn in his garden.'

Supportive: Parents Veerpan Kau and Kerry King said there were plenty of staff to cover for the head teacher

His mother-in-law Mona Neil, 90, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, said: 'I knew he was planning but I don't know what's just happened. I know he was thinking, hoping to go.'

Mr McGovern, who lives with his wife 
Kathryn, 49, in the village of Countesthorpe, Leicestershire, is due 
back before the school breaks up on July 11.

A parent who asked not to be named said letters had been sent to the parents to inform them Mr McGovern had taken leave for personal reasons.

Mrs McGovern, who is also a headteacher at a Leicestershire primary school, was unavailable for comment.

Last week it was reported headteacher and football fan Mark Williams quit his job to travel to the World Cup because he would not miss 'the trip of a lifetime'

A
 National Association of Head Teachers spokesman said: 'Mr McGovern 
applied for an unpaid leave of absence and was granted the time off by 
his governing body after many years of distinguished service.

'We
 represented our member during the appeal as we would all members on 
personnel issues. Ultimately, the decision belongs to the governing 
body, which appears to have acted in line with its own policies and at 
no cost to the public purse.'

Susan
 Holmes, a governor at the school, said: 'I would love to be able to 
comment but all the board of governors were told not to say anything 
about it.

'I have since left the board over a disagreement I had with a policy, but I still can't say anything.'

A
 Department for Education spokesman said: 'It is the responsibility of 
the school’s governing body to take decisions on staffing and leave.'

Stafford
 Leys Primary School was built in 1966 and is situated in Leicester 
Forest East, five miles to the west of the city centre.

Changes to the law in September last year meant headteachers would only grant pupils leave of absence during term time in 'exceptional circumstances'.

It is then upto the headteacher to decide how many days a pupil is allowed to be away from school if the leave is granted.

Parents who take their children out of school can be fined £60 per child, which increases to £120 if it is not paid within 28 days.

Failure to pay can result in court action and in extreme cases a short prison term.

It has 518 boys and girls aged between four and ten on the roll and was rated 'good' by Ofsted in March this year.

Last week it was reported headteacher 
and football fan Mark Williams quit his job to travel to the World Cup 
because he would not miss 'the trip of a lifetime.'

The
 England and West Ham fan told governors at High Lawn Primary School, in
 Bolton, that he wanted to resign so he could go to the tournament.

They gave him two weeks off during 
term time to travel to Brazil and he is due to return in July for the 
remainder of the summer term before a new headteacher takes over in 
September.

Yesterday, 
meanwhile, it was reported a mother had declared she will risk a prison 
sentence for letting her son miss three days of school to attend her 
wedding.

Clare Whitelegg was furious her nine-year-old son's primary school refused her request for him to take time off lessons to watch her marry her police officer fiance Andy McLeary.

The school argued that the wedding did not warrant time off because it could not be classed as ‘exceptional circumstances’.

Parents can be punished if they take their children out of school outside holidays.

They can be fined £60 per child, which increases to £120 if it is not paid within 28 days.

Failure to pay can result in court action and in extreme cases a short prison term.
