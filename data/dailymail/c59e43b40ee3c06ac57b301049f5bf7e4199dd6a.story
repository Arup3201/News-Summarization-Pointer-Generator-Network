CLICK HERE to read why Welbeck might not start in a central role against United 

Fortunes in football can turn on small details, and so it is in the case of Danny Welbeck.

Late on transfer deadline day, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger signed the England centre forward from Manchester United if not exactly against his better judgement, then certainly with some reservations.

Wenger had initially wanted to sign Radamel Falcao from Monaco, but had been put off by the astronomical weekly wage — in excess of £250,000 a week.

At the last minute, Wenger decided to take Welbeck instead, while Falcao — to everybody’s surprise — joined United on a season’s loan.

As the two clubs prepare to face each other at the Emirates, it would appear, for the moment at least, that Arsenal got the better deal.

Welbeck heads into the game having scored five times for his new club this season and the same amount for England.

Falcao, meanwhile, will stay behind in Manchester on Saturday nursing an injured calf, having made almost no impact at Old Trafford.

‘Arsene wanted Falcao but the numbers were too high,’ an Arsenal source revealed this week. ‘He wasn’t totally sure about Welbeck, wasn’t sure he was exactly right. He thought his business was done for the summer and headed off to Europe on deadline day.’

On the manager’s say-so it was signed off by his chief negotiator at the Emirates, Richard Law. The Arsenal manager’s reservations about Welbeck were familiar. Wenger was, by all accounts, unsure about the centre forward’s natural abilities as a finisher.

The jury may remain out on that one — Welbeck has scored in a relatively modest three games for Arsenal so far — but it is understood that the Arsenal manager has been impressed by his new signing’s willingness to learn, work and also with his link-up play.

Peculiarly, Welbeck has also transpired to be quicker than Wenger thought.

The striker was born in the Manchester suburb of Longsight and was spotted by United talent scouts when he was only six-years-old.

For more reasons than this, he was always a popular player at United, as Wayne Rooney’s comments indicated on Friday.

Impeccably mannered and fully understanding of team principles, he works hard on his finishing in training, even if it was not always the case.

A United source told Sportsmail this week: ‘Maybe when he was younger Danny didn’t do quite enough on his finishing as he could have, but that changed over time.

‘He puts the hours in now and has done over recent years.’

At Old Trafford, former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson always believed in Welbeck. His successor David Moyes was not so sure but former United captain Gary Neville and coach Rene Meulensteen have both subsequently criticised Louis van Gaal’s decision to sell him.

‘It’s a strange one,’ said Neville. ‘I can’t work it out.’ Ferguson perhaps didn’t do the young forward that many favours by constantly playing him out of position.

An accommodating type, Welbeck rarely complained about being shunted out to the right and the left, but it irritated those close to him, the feeling being that he was never given the opportunity to flourish in his natural position.

This issue has always been at the heart of the Welbeck debate and working out which came first is something of a chicken-and-egg question. Did Welbeck get shoved out wide because he wasn’t scoring enough goals? Or did he not score enough goals because he was too rarely used as an central striker?

Certainly it was easy to feel sorry for him in the summer of 2012. Having finished the previous season showing signs of a productive and natural partnership with Rooney, Welbeck then saw Ferguson spend heavily on recruiting Robin van Persie from Arsenal.

Perhaps that, in essence, was the end of Welbeck’s chances at United. Whatever the case, new manager Van Gaal appeared to get a little irritated when asked about Welbeck again on Thursday. Equally, the Falcao topic is becoming an unpopular one.

‘It’s not just a question of fitness, but also you have to train with the group,’ the United manager said. ‘For now Falcao does not train with the group so it’s out of the question for him to be on the bench. With Welbeck, it was a good move for him. As a first choice he will develop himself much more.

‘If it was right for us depends how we play, how we score, and what position we shall finish in the league.’

Sources close to Welbeck insisted this week that it was the player’s decision to leave on hearing of Falcao’s imminent arrival in August. He was, they say, not prepared for another season among the supporting cast.

If that is true then he is to be commended. Equally, it is fair to say he still needs to become more clinical in front of goal and learn to score more frequently in the really big games.

Welbeck’s most high-profile goal for United was probably his strike at Real Madrid in the Champions League in February 2013.

Apart from that, he scored twice against Tottenham and Arsenal in three full Barclays Premier League seasons for United and once against Manchester City.

This season his goals for his new club have come against Aston Villa, Galatasaray and Hull.

Saturday would certainly be a good day to buck that particular trend.

Arsenal’s other main striker Olivier Giroud is fit again and, for Welbeck, the battle for the No 9 slot will soon begin all over again.
