Former Leeds United managing director David Haigh has been arrested following accusations of financial irregularities made by the club's ex-owners.

According to the BBC, Haigh was arrested in Dubai after GFH, a private equity group based in Dubai, claimed that the alleged issues concern their ownership and sale of the Yorkshire club to Massimo Cellino in April.

Haigh, who quit as an employee of GFH earlier this year, was arrested after landing in Dubai and has spent three nights in custody. He denies the allegations made against him.

A friend of Haigh's told the BBC: 'David has done absolutely nothing wrong or illegal. He is appalled to find himself in this position.

'However,
 as someone who knows Dubai well and respects its institutions he is 
confident that the authorities will see these allegations for what they 
really are and clear him from any wrongdoing.'

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are
 aware of the arrest of a British National in Dubai on 18 May 2014. We 
are providing consular assistance.'
