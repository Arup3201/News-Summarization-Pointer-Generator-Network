Quite what the little boy who lives down the lane would make of it is open to conjecture.

But parents at one school made their feelings plain when they heard their children reciting ‘Baa Baa Little Sheep’.

They accused the £2,700-a-term Park Hill primary school of changing the words from ‘Baa Baa Black Sheep’ for the sake of political correctness.

Political correctness gone mad: At their Easter concert, pupils at Park Hill School swapped the word 'black' in Baa Baa Black Sheep for 'little' as they sang

Bemused: Andrea Craig tweets after she saw her son's Easter concert

The school, in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, insists this was not the reason, and that the change was merely a way of teaching children to read by adding different words. Adults who attended its Easter concert, however, were unconvinced.

Andrea Craig, a councillor whose son sang in the show, tweeted: ‘At my son’s Easter concert I saw a song called Baa Baa Little Sheep which I assumed was new. Not so – not allowed black. Really?’

Councillor Andrea Craig Kingston upon Thames was surpised by the change of wording in Baa Baa Black Sheep

She said most parents in the audience were concerned about the change of wording.

‘It’s good they want children to think
 about what different words mean. But this is one nursery rhyme I 
personally don’t think should be used because it could be so easily 
misconstrued as political correctness gone mad. They have got to be a 
bit smarter about it.’

The school uses the phonic learning 
system  to teach children aged three to seven word meanings through 
well-known songs and rhymes. Its marketing manager Holly Christie said 
Baa Baa Black Sheep had been changed ‘because it fitted in with the 
theme of what we were doing. It was about baby sheep.

‘We have always had adjustments to Baa
 Baa Black Sheep just because the children like to sing different 
variations of that. It’s a way of teaching phonics so that children 
understand these words that they are using and then reading.’

This is far from the first time the 
rhyme has been amended. In 2006, children at two nurseries in 
Oxfordshire were taught ‘Baa Baa Rainbow Sheep’ to promote ‘equal 
opportunities’. Some children in London have been taught ‘Baa Baa Green 
Sheep’.

And in 1999, Birmingham City Council said the rhyme should not be taught at all because it was racially negative.
