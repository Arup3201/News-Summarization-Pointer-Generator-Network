The unborn baby of pregnant body-in-suitcase murder accused Heather Mack now has a lawyer to look after his or her interests as it becomes increasingly clear the child will be born in an Indonesian jail, MailOnline can reveal.

Vanessa Favia arrived on the tropical island of Bali on Monday along with Mack's Chicago-based lawyer Michael Elkin to make sure the baby, due in early spring, gets all the help it needs.

Favia - who has been photographed exclusively by MailOnline examining an ultrasound image of the unborn baby - has been looking at the child's immediate future after its birth.

Mack's Indonesian lawyer Raja Nasution told MailOnline that Favia, 35, will 'ensure that the humanitarian and governmental interests of Heather's unborn child are safeguarded now and in the future.'

Heather, 19, and her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21, both from the Chicago area, are awaiting charges in the death of Heather's mother, wealthy socialite Sheila von Wiese Mack whose was killed on August 12.

The two are accused of bludgeoning the 62-year-old widow to death in her hotel room in Bali and cramming the battered body into a piece of luggage. They are said to have taken the suitcase down to the hotel lobby and given it to a taxi driver, saying they would be back.

After two hours, and with blood starting to seep from the case the driver went to police who found the young lovers asleep in each other's arms in a hotel near the island's international airport.

Favia and Elkin flew to Bali to help prepare Heather's case and look after the interests of the baby. Elkin told MailOnline before he left that Nasution's team has now been in touch with lawyers working for Schaefer.

Sources in Bali say Favia is paying particular interest in the health of the unborn baby and has been advised on the likely possibility that the child will be born while Miss Mack is still behind bars as her trial proceeds through the laborious Indonesian legal system.

Mack and Schaefer both face the possibility of execution by firing squad if found guilty of murder.

Austere: Mothers being detained in Bali's notorious Kerobokan Prison, where Mack will spend many years if she is convicted of murder and spared execution, are only allowed to keep babies with them until they are two

New mothers being detained in Bali’s notorious Kerobokan Prison, where Heather Mack will spend many years if she is convicted of murder and spared execution, are allowed to keep their babies with them until they are two-years-old.

Then they are either handed over to relatives or placed in care with local families or charity groups.

Favia and Elkin attended the Trijata Police Clinic in the Balinesw capital Denpasar on Wednesday where Mack's health and that of her unborn child were checked. The two attorneys spent some time examining an ultrasound image which they had been allowed to photograph on an iPhone.

Five other lawyers who have been appointed by prosecutors and are currently working without charge also went along to the clinic, along with several senior police officers.

Neither lawyer would make any comment during the clinic visit, but Elkin released a statement saying they were in Bali to assist Nasution and fellow Indonesian lawyer Lily Lubis, 'in any manner that they feel is appropriate and necessary.'

According to Favia's page on the legal website AVVO, she is based in the Chicago suburb of Oakbrook Terrace. Nasution said she has worked 'on behalf of abused and neglected children in the juvenile court system' and she will handle the case 'in the most appropriate and necessary manner.'

However, it is understood the two U.S lawyers will have no standing in any local court and their presence is to aid Nasution and his team.

Indonesian prosecutors and senior police have made it clear that despite reports that attempts will be made to move Mack and Schaefer to the U.S. to face unrelated charges there, they will face judges in Denpasar.

The couple's two hours of relative freedom from the monotony of prison life began on Wednesday when they were each taken from their cells and escorted to the clinic.

Check up: Schaefer hid his face as he was also taken to the clinic from his cell for a medical examination

 For Schaefer, dressed in an orange prison top and with his wrists handcuffed, it was a brief three minute ride in a police car from Denpasar police headquarters to the clinic, arriving 15 minutes before his girlfriend and eventually leaving five minutes after her. 

Heather, who has complained of being held in isolation in a cell at South Kuta police station, wore a blue baseball cap, a red top and white shorts for her 25-minute road trip for her appointment with the doctors.

Her psychological and physical health - along with the condition of her unborn baby - were checked, the US lawyers waiting patiently while the examinations took place.

Though the American attorneys are in Bali to learn about the case against Mack, it is understood they have also been briefed about the pending charges against Schaefer.

Schaefer's mother Kia Walker has set up a fundraising effort on the YouCaring website which has so far raised $8,816 towards a goal of $100,000.

'Tommy desperately needs to raise money to pay for a lawyer in Indonesia,' Walker wrote on the site. 'I love and care deeply for my son.'

She said she needed the money to pay for legal services in Indonesia as well as food, medicine and other necessities. 

'Prisoners are expected to pay for their basic needs,' she wrote. 'Tommy and I will be grateful for anything you can donate,' Walker added. When contacted by MailOnline she said she has been advised to say no more about the case.

Schaefer and Mack have been kept in separate cells to prevent them consulting with one another during the murder investigation - although until now neither has co-operated with police.

Police commander Djoko Hariutomo has told MailOnline that the case against the couple is very strong.

Gruesome: Mack and Schaefer are alleged to have stuffed von Wiese Mack's body in this suitcase and taken it out to a waiting taxi. When they didn't return for two hours, blood began to seep out and the alarm was raised

Bali Police revealed that Mrs Mack was killed when she was hit about the head and face by a heavy glass ashtray and a vase in the bedroom she was sharing with her daughter Heather at the plush St Regis Hotel in the beachside Nusa Dua district of Bali.

Police claim it came hours after the trio were seen on hotel surveillance cameras in the lobby of the hotel arguing over who would pay the bill. 

They say they have CCTV evidence of Schaefer carrying the suitcase in the stairway of the hotel after Mrs Mack was killed.

Mack and Schaefer are not expected to appear in court for several weeks, when, police say, they will be formally charged with murder.

Under Indonesia’s legal system, they have already been 'designated' - meaning that murder charges have been drawn up against them and will become 'active' when they go to court.
