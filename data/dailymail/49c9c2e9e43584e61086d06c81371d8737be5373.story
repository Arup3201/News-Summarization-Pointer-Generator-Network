Guilty: Caroline Banana was sentenced in April for fraud after her windfall in 2011

A mother-of-three sparked outrage when it was revealed she continued to claim benefits after winning £95,000 on Deal Or No Deal.

Caroline Banana, 40, from Stoke-on-Trent, received the windfall after appearing on the TV game show in April 2011 and was eventually punished in April of this year when her case went to court.

As previously reported in the Daily Mail, she was sentenced to a 12-month community order with 200 hours of unpaid work and ordered to repay more than £6,000 after admitting six counts of fraud.

Many felt the sentence was lenient given her crimes and that she should have gone to jail.

But
a new BBC documentary has revealed that she wouldn't have faced justice
at all if it wasn't for the efforts of investigators at Stoke-on-Trent City Council.

Paul
Bicknell, benefit fraud manager at the council said: 'It's quite 
distressing when you think how many people are in difficult situations 
and here's someone who has just walked away with a tax free lump sum of 
£95,000 and yet still feels it's ok to keep claiming all the benefits 
she can.'

Despite her 
being seen on Deal Or No Deal pocketing the fortune, this was 
not enough to for the council to accuse her of fraud after she carried 
on claiming benefits.

Britain
On The Fiddle, which airs on BBC One on Wednesday evening, shows how 
Banana was only able to be charged after evidence was built up against 
her following months of research and surveillance.

Steve Prince was the main investigator for the council in Banana's case. He had to stake out her house
and her children's school for weeks to track her movements. He also had to trawl her bank accounts and Facebook page to find evidence of her deceit.

He explains on the documentary what drove him to become a fraud investigator and why he was determined to bring Banana to justice. He said: 'I was bought up on an estate with a family of nine, none of us would ever dream of claiming benefits fraudulently. When you hear of people doing it, it does get to you.'

He added: 'She's
been claiming benefits from people like myself that contribute to that 
system. When she won the money, it was the time to say thank you for your help, I don't
need that money anymore.'

But instead, Banana didn't declare her winnings and carried on claiming income support, housing benefits, single person discount on council tax and free school meals for her children.

Thanks to her winnings and benefits, she drove a 4x4, took a seven week holiday in Turkey and started a business buying and renting properties in the country.

To catch her out, the council had to get written evidence from Endemol, the TV company who makes Deal Or No Deal, that they had paid Banana £95,000.

When this was confirmed, they then searched Banana's bank records and found she had divided the fortune between three different accounts she had opened in her own name.

She was also earning undeclared money by doing shifts as a receptionist.

As well as claiming she needed benefits in order to live and feed her children despite her game show winnings and earnings, the investigators were intrigued to see her with her ex-husband on the show.

She was meant to have separated from Michael Thabo in 2008 but he played the dutiful husband  during her Deal Or No Deal appearance.

Mr Prince were alarmed to see them 
acting like a couple when Banana was claiming housing benefit as a 
single occupier in Stoke and Thabo was doing the same in Stockport.

On her Facebook page, he found further evidence the couple were still together. He found pictures of them on holiday and Thabo still had his relationship status listed as 'married to Caroline Banana.'

Mr Prince also uncovered that Thabo had come from luxurious beginnings before coming to the UK with his family as political
refugees. His father had been president of Zimbabwe before Robert 
Mugabe seized power and the family had lived well in a state house. 

The
council eventually had enough evidence to confront Banana and 
interviewed her. She admitted she had funded her seven week holiday with
her winnings from Deal Or No Deal.

When
asked what she thought taxpayers would think about her winning 
thousands while still claiming benefits, she replied: 'They wouldn't be 
happy.'

She was charged and appeared at Staffordshire Magistrates Court in April where she was sentenced to the unpaid work and ordered to replay £6,000.

Mr Prince said they were satisfied their efforts led to a conviction. 'After an allegation of someone getting some money, we've proved it and proved she'd done stuff with the money and lived a lavish lifestyle for a time while the public were paying her rent and council tax,' he said.

Her appearance attracted widespread media attention and the BBC footage shows her pushing over a photographer trying to snap her, telling him: 'It's not fair what you're doing.'

As she leaves court after her sentence, Britain On The Fiddle presenter, Richard Bilton, asks her why she did it and if she's sorry. But she refuses to answer.
