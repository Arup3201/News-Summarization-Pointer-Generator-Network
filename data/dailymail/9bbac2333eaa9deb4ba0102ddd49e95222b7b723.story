Barbara Bush has been released from a Houston hospital after undergoing treatment for a respiratory issue.

The former First Lady and mother of President George W Bush had been hospitalized since Monday at Methodist Hospital in Houston while being treated for penumonia.

Family spokesman Jim McGrath said the Bush family matriarch was released Saturday morning.

Mrs Bush and her husband, 41st President George H.W. Bush, are currently the longest-married first couple and are set to celebrate their 69th wedding anniversary on January 6.

Mr McGrath earlier this week called her 'a national treasure.'

President Barack Obama and former-President Bill Clinton sent warm wishes to Mrs Bush and her husband thanked the two with a tweet issued through his spokesman.

Mrs Bush has been having more health problems in recent years.

In November 2008 she underwent surgery for a perforated ulcer.

A year later, she had heart surgery to correct a severe narrowing of the main heart valve and in 2010 she had a milk relapse of Graves disease.

Her husband has had deteriorating health as well.

The 89-year-old spend nearly two months at the same hospital while being treated for a bronchities-related cough. He was released in January 2013 but has been unable to attend many events since then.Â
