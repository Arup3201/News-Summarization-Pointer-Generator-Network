John O'Brien, 53, died in September last year after cannabis triggered a massive drop in blood pressure that proved deadly

A man died after suffering heart problems as a result of a decade-long addiction to  cannabis, an inquest heard. 

John O'Brien, 53, from Salford, began smoking cannabis to cope with life-changing brain injuries sustained in a car crash.

But over a ten-year period, the Class B drug took its toll on his body and caused his heart to stop working.

A coroner at Bolton Coroner's Court ruled in December 2014 that Mr O'Brien died from cannabis cardiotoxicity, a little known condition in which smoking cannabis triggers heart problems.

In Mr O'Brien's case, smoking marijuana caused a massive drop in blood pressure which  proved deadly.

His relatives have now issued an urgent warning to others, urging them to be wary of the dangers of smoking the drug.

His twin brother Mark, 54, a builder who also lives in Swinton, Salford, said Mr O'Brien began taking the drug to cope with the pain of losing his job and relationship in the accident which left him with personality changes and unable to work.

He was travelling in the back of a friend's car not wearing a seatbelt when he was catapulted forward, hitting his head on the seat in front of him.

Signed off disabled, Mr O'Brien developed a £25-a-week cannabis habit, smoking around three or four joints a day.

He was found lifeless at home on 30th September 2014 by his former partner, who had remained his carer since the accident in 1988.

Because he collapsed partially upright against a sofa, it is thought the cannabis cardiotoxicity starved his brain of blood, leading to his death.

Mr O'Brien's family say people have been stunned that cannabis killed him – and want to speak out to warn others.

Mark O'Brien said: 'Obviously we knew drugs were bad for him but we didn't think they would kill him.

'He said he'd smoke to forget all the things he'd lost as a result of the car accident.

'We'd always be on at him to give up cannabis and he said he was trying to get off it and was on a cannabis substitute.

'The tragedy was a few weeks before his death he'd joined a gym and really cut down on it.'

Research into the effects of cannabis on the cardiovascular system is still only beginning - but one study found middle-aged men are most likely to be seriously affected.

Evidence was also found that marijuana may trigger pre-existing heart conditions that users were previously unaware of.

Cannabis cardiotoxicity is a little-known condition in which smoking cannabis triggers heart problems.

In Mr O’Brien’s case, a ten year addiction stopped his heart from working, and he suffered a deadly drop in blood pressure.

Dr Benno Hartung, from the University of Dusseldorf, Germany, wrote a paper in February last year on two healthy men who unexpectedly died as a result of cannabis cardiotoxicity.

Writing in the journal Forensic Science International, Dr Hartung said the risk of a heart attack is elevated almost five-fold in the hour after smoking cannabis.

Cannabis smoking can cause an increase in heart rate that leads to the muscle becoming blocked in individuals susceptible to this, and they can suffer heart failure, he said.

‘Persons who are at high risk for cardiovascular diseases are  recommended to avoid the use of cannabis,’ Dr Hartung concluded.

Mark O'Brien said: 'When we tell people he died due to cannabis they just don't believe it.

'If we can stop one more person from smoking cannabis it will be worth it.'

Commenting on Mr O'Brien's death, David Raynes, a spokesman for the National Drug Prevention Alliance, told MailOnline: ‘German researchers have found how cannabis affects the heart.

'What is said is that cannabis triggers heart problems that can kill some people. 

'Death from cannabis cardiotoxicity is rare but it does happen. 

'We’re told cannabis is harmless but it’s not. 

'People aren’t aware of this danger. It’s not widely re-publicised.

'These are small amounts of cannabis, which makes it even more worrying. 

'There are a lot of people campaigning for legalisation who say it's harmless, but it’s just not true.’ 

The news comes after MailOnline reported how a mother-of-three from Bournemouth who was the first woman in Britain to die form cannabis poisoning.

Gemma Moss, 31, died after she was poisoned by the cannabis she smoked to help her get to sleep.

She had previously smoked half a joint a night to help her doze off, but had stopped for two years before she died, taking up smoking again before her death to help beat insomnia. 

An inquest in January 2014 ruled her death was caused by cannabis toxicity, and a coroner recorded a verdict of death by cannabis abuse. 

Meanwhile a case report published in the journal Forensic Science International in February 2014 described the cases of two healthy men who died unexpectedly under the influence of cannabis.

Lead author Dr Benno Hartung, from the University of Dusseldorf, Germany, said a full range of postmortem tests corroborated the conclusion that the men died from cannabis cardiotoxicity.

Mr O'Brien's brother Mark has spoken out about the dangers of the drug, which his brother had smoked daily for ten years. 'If we can stop one more person from smoking cannabis it will be worth it,' he said.

In December 2014 a coroner ruled that Mr O'Brien died as a result of heart problems triggers by a misuse of cannabis. He had been smoking £25 a week to cope after a car crash ten years ago left him disabled and he lost his job and relationship

They had a marked increase in heart rate that might have led to blood flow to the heart being blocked in individuals susceptible to this.

Writing in the paper, he said the assumption was the men died due to heart rhythm problems evoked by smoking cannabis, although they did not rule out that other factors may have predisposed them to heart problems.

The risk of a heart attack increases five-fold in the hour after smoking cannabis, he said.

He concluded: 'People who are at high risk for cardiovascular diseases are recommended to avoid the use of cannabis.' 

Rosanna O’Connor, director of the Alcohol, Drugs and Tobacco Division at Public Health England said: 'Based on evidence from across Europe, we know that stronger strains of cannabis may well be causing more problems. 

'Our figures show that more and more people are using specialist drug services to get help for cannabis use, even though the overall trend is falling. 

'This increase is likely to be due to a greater awareness of the risks and problems caused by cannabis by both people using the drug and health professionals referring people on to services.'
