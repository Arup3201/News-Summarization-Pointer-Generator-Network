Ian Brady is now believed to have written a letter about the location of Moors murder victim Keith Bennett, pictured, though police doubt it contained an 'X marks the spot'

Police now believe child killer Ian Brady did write a letter about the location of the body of Moors murder victim Keith Bennett.

Jackie Powell, Brady's former mental health advocate, made the claim in a controversial Channel 4 documentary earlier this year.

Detectives initially dismissed the 
idea as a ‘cruel ruse’ – but now they say they have found evidence that 
could back up her statement after a raid on her home in south Wales.

Police found an envelope with the words ‘to be opened in the event of my death’ written on the front.

It was believed to be in Brady’s handwriting, but there was no letter inside.

Officers say they will continue looking into the possibility that the letter exists – although they say they doubt it contains an ‘X marks the spot’ instruction on how to find Keith’s body on Saddleworth Moor.

A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said they do now believe a letter was written and 'it is possible' it could contain information pinpointing the location of the body.

'I believe it did exist – we have some evidence to say it did.

'There are words on the front of an 
envelope as described in the TV documentary by her. She does have a lot 
of correspondence from him, as do a number of people.

'We just don’t know what was in the envelope. Enquiries are continuing although we may never get to the bottom of this', he told the Manchester Evening News.

Ms Powell, 49, who was appointed 
Brady's representative under the Mental Health Act in 1999, was arrested
in August on suspicion of preventing the burial of a body without 
lawful exercise.

She is on bail and must return to a 
police station in March, while a file is prepared for the Crown 
Prosecution Service to consider whether charges should be brought.

Ms Powell had told producers working 
for Channel 4 documentary, Endgames of a Psychopath: 'I received a 
letter and a sealed envelope which said on the front "to be opened in 
the event of my death".

'He says he doesn't wish to take his secrets to the grave and within the sealed envelope is a letter to Winnie Johnson.

'Within that is the means of her possibly being able to rest.'

During her interview with the police, Ms Powell suggested she had given the letter back to Brady. But a search of Brady's cell at Ashworth high security hospital in Merseyside has revealed no trace of the document.

Brady and Hindley were responsible for the murders of five youngsters in the 1960s, sexually torturing their victims before burying their bodies on Saddleworth Moor.

They were jailed for life in 1966 for the murders of Leslie Ann Downey, ten, John Kilbride, 12, and Edward Evans, 17.

They didn't admit to killing Keith and another victim Pauline Reade, 16, until 1987.

Hindley died in prison in 2002, aged 60.

Keith was 12 years old when he was abducted on 12 June 1964, and was the only victim whose body has never been found, despite several large-scale searches of Saddleworth Moor.

His mother Winnie, who had urged 
Brady to reveal the location of Keith's body, died in August, aged 78, 
without being able to fulfill her last wish of giving her son a proper 
burial.

Greater Manchester Police renewed 
their search to find Keith's body in 2003, including scientists, 
clinical psychologists, imagery experts, search advisers, geologists, 
geophysicists, geochemists, archaeologists and anthropologists.

In 2009, it concluded there was no 
longer any specific information to identify new search areas and 
therefore the investigation entered a dormant stage.

Earlier
this month Keith's brother Alan Bennett said 'compelling new evidence' 
has emerged that pinpoints the burial site on Saddleworth Moor.

He called on police to resume their search for Keith.
