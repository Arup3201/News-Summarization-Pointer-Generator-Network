Reading mean tweets has become a common celebrity meme recently - but one newsreader has turned the concept on its head.

In a segment on SBS2's program The Feed, Lee Lin Chin became the latest star to participate in the trend - but instead of reading out abusive messages she had been sent, she read out cheeky tweets she wrote herself.

From BBC star Jeremy Clarkson and Australian journalists Karl and Peter Stefanovic to fashion brand Dolce and Gabbana, Chin - who is known on Twitter for her sassy sense of humour - shared some of her best posts.

SBS newsreader Lee Lin Chin took on the mean tweets trend in a segment for The Feed on Tuesday night

First on her hit-list was Clarkson, to whom she wrote: 'We all know the only reason you're a racist is because I rejected your advances.'

For ABC journalist Tony Jones, who hosts the network's weekly panel show QandA, Chin had some advice.

'How about instead of asking questions you form your own opinion you fence sitting nimrod,' the SBS newsreader wrote.

Chin also took aim at fashion brand Dolce and Gabbana, claiming only 'poor people who just won the lottery' actually buy their 'so called designs'. 

And she had a message for TV's Stefanovic brothers.

'@KarlStefanovic and @PeterStefanovic 'I'm calling for a fight to the death between you two.

Chin described ABC's QandA host Tony Jones as a 'fence-sitting nimrod'

The newsreader also suggested the Stefanovic brothers 'fight to the death' saying she would wed the winner

'Highlander rules. There can only be one. Survivor becomes my bride. xx,' she read out with a wry smile.

Chin angled for some free booze in another tweet to Coopers Brewery... but not before insulting the company's beverages. 

'Do you brew your beer in a toilet? Because it tastes like poo. Having said that I'd be interested in some free samples. Talk soon.'

Colleague Marc Fennell, who hosts The Feed got a simple 'f*** you', while Chin also threw elbows at SBS World News anchor Anton Enus.

Fellow SBS colleague Ricardo Gonclaves bored the brunt of Chin's online abuse

'What's it like needing a co-host to hold your hand? Reading the news isn't that hard... are you dyslexic?' Chin asked. 

However it was fellow SBS colleague Ricardo Goncalves who really bore the brunt of Chin's xxxx

'In six months you'll be working for @BuzzfeedOz... on a freelance basis,' she taunted in one tweet.

'I know you want my job but the only way you'll get it if i die. But that's not going to happen because I'm immortal. The Alpha and the Omega! The beginning and the end!' the SBS host wrote in another.

Some of the newreader's best work is centred around her age

Chin is well known for her sharp sense of humour on social media, and since joining Twitter last year has amassed over 22,000 followers.

Some of her best work includes postings about her age, other TV presenters, being a 'bachelorette' and a classic 'Your Mum' joke thrown into the mix.

'Let's face facts, TV presenters and newsreaders are just people who wanted to be famous but couldn't act or sing', one of Chin's recent tweets reads.

'I'll die as a I lived, alone by choice #bachelorettelife', she wrote in another.

'All my childhood friends have grandchildren, HAHA! What boring idiots!', the newsreader quipped earlier this year. 

'I'll die as a I lived, alone by choice #bachelorettelife', she wrote in one of her tweets
