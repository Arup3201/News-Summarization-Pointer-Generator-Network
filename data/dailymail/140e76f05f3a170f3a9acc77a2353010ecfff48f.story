Fabio Moniz, 27, has been sentenced to life in jail after being convicted of raping two women last year and attempting to assault others

A predatory rapist who posed as a gay Vogue  photographer to snare wealthy young victims was jailed for life yesterday.

Fabio Moniz, 27, toured exclusive West End venues to charm women with his ‘cut glass’ accent and immaculate manners.

But he poisoned them with the date rape drug GHB before subjecting them to sexual assaults.

He told the court that his life was like that of conman Frank  Abagnale portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio in the film Catch Me If You Can.

Yesterday Moniz was jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum of nine years for raping two women.

But detectives suspect he may have claimed many more victims. In 2009 he was cleared of attacking an American tourist. Judge Patricia Lees told Snaresbrook Crown Court that the Portuguese national was a ‘lone predator’ and a ‘very dangerous character’.

Moniz prowled the West End hunting for victims at fashionable nightclubs including Whisky Mist and Mahiki.

His Facebook page is full of  pictures of him posing with women at nightspots in the capital. He pretended to be a photographer, club promoter and even claimed to work for City accountants KPMG and to have partied with celebrities including pop star Rihanna.

In the first of the attacks in September last year, he approached two women outside the Funky Buddha nightclub. Telling them he ‘works in the fashion business with supermodels’ they went to another club where he spiked their drinks.

One of them said: ‘He was smartly 
dressed in a denim shirt, sweater and jeans and had a cut-glass accent 
with a slight lisp.’

Moniz took them back to a flat in Bermondsey, 
south-east London, where one woke up to discover him trying to have sex 
with her.

Just 20 days 
later he targeted an American in her early thirties who was dining alone
 in Claridges. He told her he was gay and had just finished a Vogue 
photoshoot before taking her to a club. She can remember little more 
except she woke up naked in her hotel room with Moniz beside her. In 
both cases he stole personal possessions including credit cards.

Moniz
 was confronted in court by a second American who accused him of raping 
her in 2009. The woman, now a successful financial analyst, travelled 
back to Britain to give evidence against him.

Police
 do not know how long Moniz has been in Britain. Detective 
Superintendent Kate Halpin said: ‘Given the nature of his crimes, it is 
highly likely Moniz  has committed further offences.’

Moniz,
 of no fixed address, who was convicted of two counts of rape and one of
 attempted rape at an earlier hearing, was ordered to sign the sex 
offenders’ register for life.
