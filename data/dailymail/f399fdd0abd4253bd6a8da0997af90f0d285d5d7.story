Rooney scored four times at the tournament as a teenager before an injury in the 27th minute of the quarter final against Portugal ended his tournament.

He said: 'My debut at such a young age and the Euro 2004 was the stand out tournament for me because I scored four goals.

'I think I have many years ahead of me and I am looking forward to playing a lot more. I will always make myself available.

'As a young boy it was a dream to play at Wembley and to go out there and receive my caps from Sir Bobby Charlton will be special moment.

'It will be an incredible feeling and a special moment.'

Rooney also admitted Charlton's goalscoring record (49) and Peter Shilton's appearance record (125) were in his sights.

He added: 'If I keep playing then I am sure I will come closer to them.'

Rooney added: 'There's millions of people who want to play for England and I am fortunate enough to have done it many times now. From the day you meet up there is excitement and you try to win and the ultimate dream is to win a trophy.

'No-one can take it away from me. There's people starting as a young boy with my parents taking me to training and working with people at Everton and Manchester United. Then my wife and children, to be a father and a husband, gives me the balance in my life and it helps in my football. So I would like to thank all of them.

'It is not every day someone could say they are World Cup winners and I would like to join them. I am honoured to be able to do it.

'I had to mature quickly because I am in the limelight. On the pitch I have developed as a player. I have more composure on the ball than when I was 17 or 18.

'Barring injury playing for England is something I love doing. When you finish you are retired a long time. I have always said if selected I am available.

'I went back to my old school a couple of weeks ago and it was really nice to go back and see teachers who are still there. To see the kids was a great feeling, but when you play in the school playground I used to pretend I was Michael Owen.

'As captain of England it makes me proud.'

He added: 'The red card against Portugal in the World Cup quarter final was really rough. We played Portugal had 10 men, we were out and I was hoping they would get through. I thought it was my fault.'
