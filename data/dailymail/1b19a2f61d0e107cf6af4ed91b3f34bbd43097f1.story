Manny Pacquiao hopes to have an answer from Floyd Mayweather Jnr this week as footage emerged of the two holding talks over their £200million mega-fight. 

The meeting took place in the Filipino star's Miami hotel suite two weeks ago after the pair came face-to-face on the basketball court hours earlier.

An announcement has yet to be made as to whether the fight will take place in Las Vegas on May 2, but Pacquiao told Fox News Sunday: 'I'm thinking passionately that the fight will happen.

'Hopefully this week we will hear from them and fix the fight.'

A video clip had earlier appeared on Mayweather's Instagram page showing him and Pacquiao in private discussing the potential bout. 

He said: 'I congratulate him (Pacquiao) on his career, he had a wonderful career, and I have had a wonderful career, but before we leave this sport of course we have to make this fight happen.'  

And he wrote: 'From the looks of this video... I'm telling Manny Pacquiao that we have to give the world this fight.' 

It was believed that the remaining issues involved the broadcast of the fight with Mayweather contracted to Showtime and Pacquiao to HBO.

But HBO president Ken Hershman said this week: 'We're here to stand by and help wherever we can to make this fight happen. We're not an impediment to that happening, and we'll do what's necessary from our end. Then, it's up to the principals.' 

Pacquiao had previously issued an ultimatum to Mayweather with the demand of an answer by the end of January.

That deadline has passed but Mayweather's post indicates a deal could yet be struck.

If it can't, the pound-for-pound No 1 will likely face Miguel Cotto while Pacquiao could face Amir Khan later in May.
