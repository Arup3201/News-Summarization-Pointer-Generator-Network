An alternative artist uses popcorn, nuts and grape stems to create incredible portraits.

Victor Nunes, 65, from São Paulo makes creative pictures of faces, people and animals by combining pen and paper with household objects.

The artist takes inanimate, mundane objects like nuts, scissors, fabric, foam, and food - and then doodles his ideas around them to create mini-masterpieces.

The 65-year-old from São Paulo, Brazil, who has worked as an advertiser and art director since 1971, said: 'I've always played with images of food and other objects.

In one picture he uses pieces of popcorn and kernel and imagines them as a multitude of animals including pigs, leopards, cows and dogs.

In another, he manages to make a half-eaten Digestive biscuit represent a bra, bike helmet, umbrella and bicycle.

'I went in with my personal Facebook 
page in February 2013 and started posting these images as an expression 
of pure enjoyment,' he says.

'Every day I do something, for me, it is a kind of therapy.

'I have no preference for materials - I regard everything as a challenge but I try simple and easy things to find like coffee, dish cloths, floor cloths and food.

'I always seek more challenges to create art and use common things to create the unusual.'

The re-imagining of inanimate, mundane objects is an example of the psychological phenomenon pareidolia.

It causes people to see random images and perceive them as something significant. In this case, Victor manages to create numerous detailed pictures from plain objects.

Our inclination to give meaning to random objects is the reason why we associate a smiley face with a human, and why some of Nunes' pieces of popcorn or biscuit resemble faces to us.

Other examples of the phenomenon include seeing the image of Jesus in burnt toast or animal figures in clouds in the sky.

He has no preference for materials but likes to use simple objects

Nuts, seeds and pulses don't go unnoticed - Victor uses most foods you'll find in the kitchen cupboard

He arranged crunchy salty snacks in the forms of trucks, boats, swings and houses
