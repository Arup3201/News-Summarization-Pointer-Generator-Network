It may be billed as an ‘honest’ way to chat on Facebook, but critics say that an app that allows people to have anonymous conversations could lead to trolling.

Cloakd is designed to let people find out what their Facebook friends really think about them, using a cloak of anonymity.

The company behind the Android app say it enables people to share their thoughts ‘in the truest form’ with people that they know.

The Cloakd app (pictured left) is designed to let people find out what their Facebook friends really think about them, using a cloak of anonymity. They can scroll through a list of their friends (right) to initiate an anonymous conversation, but both users need to use the app to join in

It says the app is for ‘the uninhibited, the unrevealed and the unpretentious; Cloakd is for the honest hello’.

But commentators are sceptical about whether the tool will be used for soul searching and 'honest hellos', instead of trolling friends, with some saying they it would feel strange using a deceptive tool against people they know.

Users can send and receive anonymous messages in the app but both parties must have it to read them.

Cloakd's website says the app is for ‘the uninhibited, the unrevealed and the unpretentious; Cloakd is for the honest hello’, but some people fear it could be used for trolling. A screenshot showing anonymous conversations is pictured left and a conversation in action, right

Users log into the Android app via Facebook.

They can search through a list of Facebook friends and add people to talk to.

By clicking on '+' a new anonymous chat is started.

Both people have to have the Cloakd app to have an anonymous conversation.

Those who don't have the app receive an email saying that they have been sent an anonymous message from 'someone in their Facebook friend list' and to read it, they have to download Cloakd. 

Users earn credits by initiating anonymous messages and credits get added and deducted depending on their activity. 

The idea is to keep a balance so a user isn’t just pestering people by initiating anonymous chats.

It is possible to block a user to stop trolling behaviour.

Other anonymous tools allow people to talk with others behind a veil of secrecy – but usually in chat rooms with strangers.

The company’s founder, Piyush Grover, from the Bangalore, India, told Business2Community: ‘A lot of the other apps based on anonymity are more of sharing your thoughts anonymously in a public space - more like your Facebook wall but making it very easy for people to defame others in public.'

He said that anonymity is a great power if used in the right way.

The company writes on its website: ‘How often do we feel the need to truly express what occupies our mind, without the hesitancy that our identity brings?

‘Wouldn’t it be cool, if we could chat with our close friends in our truest avatar?

‘Cloakd attempts to bring forth a solution. It lets you chat with your friends while keeping your identity hidden, thereby giving you the ideal platform to unmask your real thoughts.

It suggests that the app can be used to initiative conversations with friends, or strangers who have offered a friend request and that people can be blocked to stop trolling behaviour.
