A driver caught travelling at nearly 100mph yesterday told police he was late... for his speed awareness course.

The man was stopped by officers conducting speed checks on the M6 Toll between Lichfield and Burntwood in Staffordshire.

A police spokesman said: ‘At around 3.30pm officers were conducting a routine speed check on the stretch between northbound T5 and T6 of the M6 Toll, when they recorded a driver of a Nissan Pathfinder driving at a speed of nearly 95mph.

'A man in his 50s, from Sale, gave the excuse that he was late for a speed awareness course. He has now been reported for summons.'

Officers stopped another driver who was clocking up nearly 128mph. 

Speed awareness courses are offered as an alternative to a speeding fine and penalty points.

The course, usually of four hours duration, aims to help drivers to gain a fuller understanding of why people drive above the speed limit and the potential consequences of speeding.

Yesterday, a motorist was jailed for 14 months after he drove his BMW around the M25 for nine miles in the wrong direction.

Mitchell Locke, 20, was caught on CCTV cameras speeding down the wrong way between junctions four and two of the busy M25 through Kent and onto the A2 road, weaving through oncoming traffic.

The apprentice electrician from Kenley, south London, has now been jailed for 14 months and banned from getting behind the wheel for three years after he admitted dangerous driving at Dartford and Gravesham Magistrates' Court.

Highways Agency CCTV operatives had spotted Locke driving down the hard shoulder in his black BMW 120d anti-clockwise on the clockwise carriageway close to junction four at Sevenoaks.
