Tottenham's interest in Victor Wanyama will be compounded by statistics collated from his defensive midfield performances at Southampton.

Mauricio Pochettino is looking at bringing in the big Kenyan over the summer after utilising him as a defensive screen while at St Mary’s.

Tottenham had the ninth best defensive record in the Premier League and the new coach recognises that will have to improve if he is to make an impression on the Champions League qualifying places.

Southampton averaged 1.47 points per game last season but that jumped to 1.58 when Wanyama started and dropped to 1.28 when he didn’t. They conceded on average a goal every 121 minutes when he was on the pitch and that dropped to every 57 minutes when he didn’t play.

Although not heralded among Southampton’s shining lights, Wanyama, 22, was regarded as the unsung hero of the side by Pochettino.

He joined last summer from Celtic for £12million and got off to a great start in the Premier League earning plaudits from opposition managers for his displays against Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal, only for a chipped bone to restrict his progress at New Year.

Pochettino was quick to bring him back but he only returned to full fitness at the tail end of the season.

Tottenham are also interested in Jay Rodriguez but have yet to make an enquiry for Adam Lallana who is expected to join Liverpool.
