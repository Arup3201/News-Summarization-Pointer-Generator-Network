They are the must-see landmarks in cities across the world.

So the likes of the Eiffel Tower, the Empire State Building and Big Ben have to look good all year round - and the clean-up mission for each of these huge structures is on a massive scale.

At 1,000ft high, The Shard in London boasts 11,000 glass panels, which take four weeks to clean - and costs £130,000 each year, according to a new infographic. 

The mammoth task of cleaning the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France, requires 105 gallons of metal cleaning solution

In the US, the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC gets blasted with a power washer twice a year, while Paris's Eiffel Tower gets a bath once a year - requiring 105 gallons of metal cleaning solution, four tonnes of wipes and 25,000 bin bags.

Compiled by hassle.com, the graph - entitled The World's Biggest Clean-Ups - also reveals how cleaners hang from harnesses to clean the 1,450ft-high Empire State Building in New York, and how the 312 pieces of opal glass on Big Ben's four clocks in London get a rinse every five years.

The Taj Mahal in India gets a mud wash every seven years; The Gherkin in London takes 10 days to clean; 40 different cleaning methods were tested on the Acropolis in Athens, Greece, before finding the best one; and 90C water is used to blast 50 years of dirt and bird droppings from the Space Needle in Seattle.

And then spare a thought for the cleaning teams who have to  tidy after the famous La Tomatina 'tomato-pelting' festival in Valencia or the UK's legendary Glastonbury Festival.  

Music festivals are enjoyed by thousands who get a chance to let their hair down - and their rubbish. 

After the 2014 Glastonbury Festival a team of 800 litter-pickers were used across the 1,200-acre site - and it took six weeks to clean.

And it's a similar story for V Festival where 90,000 music lovers drop 150 tonnes of litter. Despite recycling bags being handed out, the clean up is an enormous task. 

Over the water, the Uranium mine clean-up in Navajo, New Mexico, US, is a shuddering challenge.

Two piles radioactive dirt remain after the kine has served its purpose, and estimates are that it will cost £50m to clean and take 100 years.
