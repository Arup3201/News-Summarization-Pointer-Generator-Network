A Chinese factory boss who wanted to make sure visitors to his building got a good impression ordered staff to put up hundreds of litter bins out to collect rubbish.

This one small stretch of path running just 200 metres along the front of the factory in the city of Shenzhen in south-eastern China's Guangdong province has more than 150 bins to make sure that there is no litter.

And even more have been put up at other places around the electronics factory.

A Chinese factory boss who wanted to make sure visitors to his building got a good impression ordered staff to put up hundreds of litter bins out to collect rubbish

The order to install the bins came after wealthy factory owner Chan Wu, 58, complained about staff sitting on the benches in the warm summer months to eat their lunch at midday, and leaving behind litter.

Saying that it gave a bad impression to visitors of his plant, and showed a sloppy work ethic by staff, he ordered the bins be installed between each of the benches to tackle the problem.

Factory spokesman Shing Tseng said: 'People now have no excuse for littering. 

'Anybody who fails to use the bins will face a disciplinary procedure.'

However there has been little problem with the rubbish since the bins were installed, because according to staff the smell from the bins right next to the benches is so bad, hardly anybody wants to eat their lunch there anymore.
