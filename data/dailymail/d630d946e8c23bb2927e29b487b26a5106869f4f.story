Malaysia's defence minister has sparked outrage after agreeing the tragedy of missing MH370 flight was a 'blessing in disguise'.

It is the latest in a series of blunders by Hishammuddin Hussein as the international search continues almost a month after the Boeing 777 went missing.

He has been criticised for withholding information from relatives, and failing to stop two Iranians who boarded the plane with stolen passports.

Blunder: Hishammuddin Hussein received a barrage of complaints after his 'insensitive' tweet about MH370

He received a tweet from Kuala Lumpur journalist Ismail Amsyar and his response caused outrage

Last night, a Kuala Lumpur-based journalist Ismail Amsyar tweeted the minister saying: 'MH370 is a blessing in disguise for all of us. I understand now the beauty of unity, the sweetness of having each other.'

In a response which has caused international uproar, Mr Hussein said: 'Right u are :)'

Outraged Twitter users hit back attacking the 'inappropriate' tweet, which has since been deleted, as families continue to fight for information on the mystery.

Mr Amsyar, who received death threats following the exchange, this morning apologised 'from the bottom of [his] heart' for the comment.

Apology: Ismail Amsyar was sent death threats following the exchange and has since apologised profusely

He apologised to Mr Hussein, who has since deleted the tweet and not commented on the incident

Mr Hussein has yet to comment on the incident.

It is widely believed the controversy over MH370 has scuppered his chances of succeeding his cousin, Malaysia's prime minister, as leader of the ruling party - with some claiming it has tarnished his entire political career.

He came under fire when once asked to defend the 'disorderly' plane search, as he retorted: 'It's only confusion if you want it to be seen to be confusion.'

Relatives of missing passengers have lashed out at Mr Hussein, blasting his 'disorderly' handling of the tragedy

Days later, he lashed out at a journalist for posing the same question, claiming it was 'irresponsible' to make the allegation.

He said: 'I have got a lot of feedback saying we have been very responsible in our action. It's very irresponsible of you to say that.'
