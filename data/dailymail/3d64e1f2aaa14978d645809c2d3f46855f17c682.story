It's a modern day break-up that proves nothing is private anymore.Â 

Vine user Khoa Nguyen posted a video of his girlfriend of three months allegedly breaking up with him because he liked another girl's Instagram photo.

'You guys just witness my breakup...#Damn,' the Vine video description reads.

In the brief clip Nguyen posted under username Khoaliti, a girl can be heard yelling in the background while he stares vacantly out the car window.

'You liked her f*****g picture on Instagram. You follow her on Instagram,' the girl shouts, as Nguyen rolls his eyes at the camera.
