Arsenal's majority shareholder Stan Kroenke is planning to bring an 80,000-seater NFL stadium to Los Angeles.

Kroenke owns the St Louis Rams franchise who were based in Los Angeles until 1994.

Los Angeles is the United States' second largest media city but it has been without an NFL team for two decades.

The LA Times reports that Kroenke, who owns 66.94 per cent of the Gunners, is planning to end the city's long wait for a major NFL team in the city.

Inglewood Mayor James Butts said: 'This proposal doesn't ask for nor will ever be offered any public funds, so what you have here is a developer, Stan Kroenke, who has invested in Inglewood and we are glad to have him here.'

Kroenke has teamed up with real estate firm Stockbridge Capital Group, which owns the 238-acre Hollywood Park site, in order to get the project off the ground.

'We are excited to unveil an expanded plan that will bring a world-class sports and entertainment district to Hollywood Park,' Terry Fancher, founder of Stockbridge, said in a statement.

'We are committed to working with [the Kroenke Group] to build a project that will put Inglewood back on the map as home of the truly great sports and entertainment venues.'
