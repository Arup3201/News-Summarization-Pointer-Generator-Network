The first pictures of the gipsy camp where an abducted four-year-old girl was rescued in Greece emerged yesterday as the international appeal to identify the child continued.

The discovery of the blonde, blue-eyed girl, who police believe may be from northern or eastern Europe, gives hope that Madeleine McCann may also be found alive.

Last night, the girl – known only as Maria – was safely playing with other children at a house run by Greek charity The Smile Of The Child, which is caring for her.

Missing and found: Madeleine McCann vanished on May 3, 2007 from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal while police are appealing for help identifying this blonde girl, known only as Maria, who was found on a gypsy camp in Greece after she was allegedly abducted

Who is she? The four-year-old sparked one of the officer's curiosity as she is pale skinned and bore no resemblance to the other children or the couple who claimed to be her parents

The authorities are sure she does not 
belong to the adults she was living with, and her nationality and the 
circumstances under which she left her real family remain a mystery.

Maria
 was found last Wednesday in a Roma settlement in Farsala, central 
Greece, after a police officer became suspicious because her pale 
complexion and blonde hair stood out during a routine raid on illegal 
activities. 

DNA tests 
proved she was not related to the couple with whom she was living.

A 
39-year-old man and a woman, 40, have been charged with abducting a 
minor.

Police have requested assistance from Interpol.

Photographs of the girl suggest her hair may have been dyed when she was younger as the bottom half of her plaits are brown.

Maria
 only speaks Roma but appears to understand Greek and is also being 
communicated with using sign language, according to staff at The Smile 
Of The Child.

One employee 
told The Mail on Sunday: ‘The little girl was terrified when she first 
came to us and didn’t talk at all, but she is now calm and has been 
playing with the other kids.’

Distress: Dirty and grimacing as her photo is taken, the little girl is now the centre of an international appeal. Authorities hope her parents can be found so the family can be reunited

Panayiotis
 Pardalis, a spokesman for the charity, said: ‘It was obvious that she 
was not a Roma girl. She was afraid and under some psychological 
pressure when she arrived.

‘She was living under bad conditions and was very dirty, but is now safe.’

Charity
 director Costas Giannopoulos said the child was undergoing medical 
examinations.

Ben Needham disappeared on the holiday isle of Kos in 1999 aged just 21 months, sparking a huge but ultimately unsuccessful police hunt.

He was seized within moments of him going to play outside a farmhouse, which his grandfather was renovating in the village of Iraklise. His mother was working as a waitress on the island at the time.

Investigators suspect the blonde-haired child was abducted by a gypsy gang, and sold to the highest bidder for adoption.

But a bungled police inquiry – which was heavily criticised by Ben’s family - failed to track down the culprits.

Despite a number of possible sightings and a range of theories about what happened to him, no trace of the youngster has ever been found.

‘We are shocked by how easy it is for people to register 
children as their own,’ he told Greek television.

Police believe up to ten more children found at the camp may be the victims of a trafficking ring.

Delphine
 Moralis, secretary general of Missing Children Europe, said: ‘This case
 is very unusual in that we’re looking for the child’s family, rather 
than the child.’

She said 
The Smile Of The Child, a member organisation of Missing Children 
Europe, have several houses in Greece where they take children ‘who have
 nowhere else to go’.

Maria’s
 discovery gives fresh hope for other British families with missing 
children, including the tragic case of Ben Needham, the Sheffield boy 
who went missing in Kos in 1991, aged 21 months.

Ben’s sister, 
Leighanna, said the discovery was ‘very significant to Ben’s case’.

‘It
 gives us great hope that one day this will be Ben.

Child trafficking 
and illegal adoption in Greece has been pretty high and that’s exactly 
what they thought had happened to Ben – that he was taken for a 
childless family and passed through gipsy camps,’ she told the BBC.

Maria
 was found just days after the Metropolitan Police revealed the results 
of a major review of the investigation into the disappearance of 
Madeleine McCann.

Comparison: The case bears a disturbing similarity to theories about the disappearance of British toddler Madeleine McCann, who went missing on a family holiday in Portugal on May 3, 2007

Breakthrough? Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry McCann (pictured on a BBC Crimewatch appeal) said they are 'genuinely hopefully' that police can make progress in the investigation

Roma gangs have been accused of trafficking hundreds of children to and from countries including Britain to mug and steal as part of an ‘international criminal network’.

Boys and girls as young as 10 are being used to make more than £2000 a month each, through crimes organised by Fagin-like bosses.

Around 200 children are though to be involved, with much of their tax free income being smuggled back to Romania to buy property.

Details of the sinister 'family' network emerged during an appeal last year in Paris against a five-year-prison sentence by Remus Stoian, a 40-year-old Romanian national.

He was found guilty alongside Palos Constantine, a compatriot also aged 40, of organising an ‘international criminal network which aimed to bring minors to France to commit theft.’

Both men were based with their ‘extended clan’ at an illegal Roma campsite in the St Denis suburb of Paris, and regularly 'trafficked' children between ‘France, Romania and even England’, a judicial source told Le Figaro.

The Tribunal de Grande Instance in Paris said Stoian and Constantine had been wire tapped as they discussed the successes of their operation, which is still being run by relatives.

The conversations reveals that children were ‘selected by hand’, with Stoain saying at one point: ‘You need four to five people who can work for you, and each can bring in between 100 and 150 euros a  day.

You can bring in 3000 euros a month.'

The young criminal gangs are taken to top tourists spots, including central London to steal from people. The reason for keeping the children moving between different countries is so that they can not be 'traced' to the adults exploiting them.

Another Romanian in the gang said he had 11 children working for him personally, with a 'clan chief' ultimately being responsible for the whole operation.
