A disabled businessman has been banned from building a bungalow on his own land because his garden falls outside the village boundary.

Polio sufferer Carl Weininger wanted to rent out his £500,000 house in West Haddon, Northamptonshire and move into a smaller property which would be modified for wheelchair access.

But council plans show that, while Mr Weininger's house is in the village, his garden is technically in open countryside and is therefore protected from development.

Plans: Carl Weininger, pictured outside his home, had hoped to build a second property in his garden that would be modified for wheelchair access. The 63-year-old has no use of his left leg or his right arm

Rejected: Planning officers at Daventry District Council told Mr Weininger that he couldn't build the proposed bungalow (site marked in yellow) on his property (red) as his garden is outside of the village boundary (blue)

The 63-year-old  has no use of his left leg and has not been able to use his right arm since a devastating motorcycle crash in 1969.

The grandfather-of-one planned to build and move into a specially bungalow in his 9,700sq ft garden - just yards from his own five-bedroom detached house.

He was stunned when planning officers at Daventry District Council told him he couldn't because the village of West Haddon's boundary line runs through the middle of his land.

'The logic defeats me. How can my house be in a village yet my garden not be?,' he said.

'It is a long way to another village so my garden is classed as being in open countryside. If it is open countryside then it can't be a garden but it is my garden, it isn't a  field.'

Mr Weininger moved into the house in 1993 and his garden was included in the village boundary.

But in 1997 the council redrew the boundary line which effectively marked his land as 'open countryside' and therefore protected from development.

The ruling means building is banned under rules to stop 'infill' - creeping developments causing villages to merge together.

Mr Weininger claims that while has been banned from building on the land, another developer has got the go-ahead for 100 new homes on land just yards away from the 'infill' boundary.

He said: 'The line zig-zags round my house yet nobody seems to be able to tell me why it couldn't have been drawn a few metres the other way.

'I asked the parish council and they said there was a consultation but there wasn't a consultation with me.

Defeated: Mr Weininger, pictured outside his home, said he would not challenge the ruling legally as it would 'cost him lots and lots of money'

'It is ridiculous. I haven't appealed because I was told I would have no chance because of the policy about the boundary line.

'So much money is wasted by councils on their own salaries and things at the top. I don't blame the planning officer because they are just doing their job.

'I blame the people that made the plan and did it with very little thought other than how much is this going to benefit the council.

'They don't seem to look at people anymore. It's a joke, houses come and go but it is residents that are important, houses don't have feelings.'

Mr Weininger said he always planned to build a bungalow eventually because of the injuries caused by the polio and motorbike crash,

He wrote to the council in 2008 after he separated from his wife - leaving him living in the large house on his own.

He added: 'I wrote to the council and what I got back to my astonishment was a preordained rule that there was no way I could build in my garden because of the village boundary line.

'I went back and looked at the plans and saw the line went straight across my back garden.

'I bought the house in 1993 and I only would have seen the Land Registry plans which it isn't on.

'I was told categorically that the policy about village confines were instigated and used from 1997.I was told I would have been consulted but I wasn't.'

Mr Weininger said that he had expected the 100 homes nearby to receive council approval as 'Daventry District Council has to build so many houses in the next five years and they haven't.' 

'The council want the houses because it increases rates, my situation is irrelevant to them, they are not bothered about me. 

'I won't challenge it legally because it would cost me lots and lots of money.'

He added that he now might be forced to sell his property and move away, but said he did not want to leave the village where his family live.

He said: 'All I really wanted was to build a home that would make living more manageable in future years and keep me out of hospital.

'I hate the thought of becoming a burden on the state, but it seems I'm being forced down that road.'

A spokesperson for Daventry District Council said: 'The Local Plan, which defines the confines of the village, has been in place since 1997 and no changes have since been made. 

'In recent years we have not received any planning applications nor pre-application enquiries for any development at Mr Weininger’s property but if we do so they will be considered on their own merits.

'We understand that West Haddon Parish Council are in the early stages of preparing a Neighbourhood Development Plan for their village and consulting residents further and if they proceed their plan will be subject to a local referendum.

'When the Local Plan was being prepared in the mid-1990s it went through various stages of consultation which included giving local people the opportunity to give their views on the proposals.'
