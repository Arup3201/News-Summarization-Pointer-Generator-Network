It is almost 75 years since they enjoyed their finest hour in the Battle of Britain.

And now, an Oxfordshire flying club has marked the momentous occasion by creating a classic Spitfire, albeit in a slightly smaller form than the World War Two version.

Led by flying instructor Paul Fowler, the club hope to build a new squadron of Spitfires in time to mark the 75th anniversary of the campaign which helped Britain defeat Hitler's Luftwaffe.   

The first Spitfire - a Supermarine Mk 26B, a 90 per cent scale replica based on the original Supermarine Spitfire design has been created by Enstone Flying Club

The plane cost £210,000 to produce, funded by enthusiasts who can buy a 12th or 20th part share for £17,000 or £11,000 and was built by a team of volunteers

Paul Fowler (pictured), the manager of the project, told MailOnline: 'What's been produced is beyond my wildest expectations. She's absolutely beautiful'

Mr Fowler, 53, has a mission and dream to build 11 more Spitfires to fly a squadron down The Mall in formation at 11am on September 15, 2015. This will mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in World War Two

The first Spitfire - a Supermarine Mk 26B, a 90 per cent scale replica based on the original Supermarine Spitfire design - is now ten days away from its maiden flight. 

Twenty volunteers - ranging from a BT engineer to a BA pilot - helped construct the first Spitfire, but more helpers are needed to build the other 11. 

Paul Fowler, the manager of the project, told MailOnline: 'What's been produced is beyond my wildest expectations. She's absolutely beautiful.

'What has been created is remarkable and not far short of a miracle and it has spurred me on to do more.'

Mr Fowler said: 'What we are doing is completely unique and no one is doing this anywhere else in the world. It's also absolutely British'

The plane weighs 810 kg and is a 90 per cent scale version of an original three-tonne Spitfire which helped Britain defeat Hitler's Luftwaffe in the Battle of Britain

The planes are created by a team of volunteers and funded by enthusiasts who can buy a 12th or 20th part share for £17,000 or £11,000

The British date the battle from 10 July to 31 October 1940, which represented the most intense period of daylight bombing

Mr Fowler, 53, has a mission and dream to build 11 more Spitfires to fly a squadron down The Mall in formation at 11am on September 15, 2015. This will mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in World War Two.

He told MailOnline: 'What we are doing is completely unique and no one is doing this anywhere else in the world. It's also absolutely British.

'I wanted to create something exciting and different to get people interested in flying and aeroplanes.'

It is hoped the Spitfires, built in Enstone, will be flown by County of Oxford Squadron pilots with the World War Two veterans in the back of the aircraft.

Mr Fowler will ask the RAF Red Arrows to teach the pilots who will fly the Spitfires the formation flying skills required to perform the mission. 

Mr Fowler said: 'In order to achieve the very ambitious goal of flying 12 Spitfires down The Mall next year we need a lot of money very quickly'

One of the aims of the project was to recognise the 'massive effort' that went into creating them during World War Two

The Spitfire produced by Enstone Flying Club burns 38 litres of fuel an hour, rather than the original Spitfire which used four and half litres a minute

The planes are produced by volunteers which Mr Fowler said is the 'whole ethos' of the project.  

When completed, each plane will weigh 810 kg and will be a 90 per cent scale version of an original three-tonne Spitfire which helped Britain defeat Hitler's Luftwaffe in the Battle of Britain. 

Mr Fowler added: 'It's slightly smaller and it also burns 38 litres of fuel an hour, rather than four and half litres a minute. It costs about £110 an hour to run, whereas the World War Two planes cost between £2,500 and £3,000 to run.'

He said the plane cost £210,000 to produce, funded by enthusiasts who can buy a 12th or 20th part share for £17,000 or £11,000.

Mr Fowler is relying on sponsors and donations to complete the squadron. He needs to raise a further £3.7million to fulfil his dream.

'In order to achieve the very ambitious goal of flying 12 Spitfires down The Mall next year we need a lot of money very quickly and we need to work quicker and ramp it up a bit.' 

Mr Fowler said he hoped to 'keep the Spitfire legend alive forever' and said he first became interested in planes at the age of eight

Mr Fowler said: 'I came up with the idea of the Spitfire club as a way of getting pilots to keep flying. I want to create a huge community which revolves around a shared love of aircraft'

The flying club hope to hold events across the UK and in Europe to build up a picture of the heyday of the Spitfire

Seats: 1 (but training version was two-seater)

Speed: 378mph

Weight: 2,309kg

Length: 9.12m

Height: 11ft 5in

Engine: Rolls-Royce Merlin 

Seats: 2

Speed: 200mph

Weight: 810kg

Length: 8.15m

Height: 7ft 1in

Engine: V6 Isuzu Trooper 

Mr Fowler, who said the aim was to 'keep the Spitfire legend alive forever', first became fascinated by flight at the age of eight when he jumped off the roof of his parents' shed with a pair of cardboard wings strapped to his back.

'I wasn't very aerodynamic, but it certainly made me want to become a pilot.

'I came up with the idea of the Spitfire club as a way of getting pilots to keep flying.

'I've found over the years that many of them give up once the excitement of learning to fly evaporates.

'I have always been interested in military history but was always trying to find a way of bringing more people into aviation. It really came about by a bit of frustration and trying to find something people were really interested in and everybody loves the Spitfire.'  

He also wants to make aeroplanes more 'accessible' to enthusiasts.

'I want to give them some hands-on experience, because having met many through the flying club, they almost seem afraid to even touch aeroplanes.

'I want to create a huge community which revolves around a shared love of aircraft.' 

Mr Fowler said he hoped to stage events across Europe. 

He said: 'We want to hold events, where the aircraft will fly in displays and be the focal point, but we also want to build up a picture of the heyday of the Spitfire, with people dressed up in 1940s gear for example.'

He said another aim of the project was to recognise the 'massive effort' that went into creating them during the war.

'I have been lucky enough to meet people who were involved in the original production. I have met some of the design team and people who worked in production at Castle Bromwich, in Birmingham. Some people worked there 12 hours a day, six days a week during the war and did the same job every single day.

'The ones I have met love the Spitfire we have created and it is great we have been able to recognise those people who helped produce it.'
