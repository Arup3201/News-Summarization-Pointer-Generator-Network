She is rumoured to have a new beau so perhaps Katie Price has decided to give herself a spring clean as she headed towards an exclusive heath clinic in Harley Street.

The glamour model, 34, who is thought to be romancing former Bachelor Gavin Henson, was seen ducking into the FreedomhealthSKIN clinic for an appointment on Wednesday.

Her agent confirmed to MailOnline mother-of-three Katie was there for a 'skin appointment' and the slim brunette kept her head down as she left the building, dressed in skinny jeans and a loose top.

Katie, who was last seen out on a date with the rugby ace and the pair were apparently knocking back the drinks for 10 hours, looked far more serious on Wednesday with her dark brown locks loose and her green jacket with sparkly sleeves covering her tiny frame. 

'Pricey' as Katie calls herself strolled confidently out of the clinic with her head held high clutching what looked like a receipt.

Katie, 34, and Gavin, 30, were seen heading into Balans, in Soho, central London, at 1am holding hands and being very flirty with one another last week.

One onlooker said the pair didn't even bother to order any food but spent the time necking drinks and chatting.

A source told The People newspaper: 'They arrived at 1am and immediately
ordered a round of cocktails. It became ­apparent that there was a 
budding romance happening.

'They both looked like they fancied one another and were not attempting to make any secret of it in front of other diners.

'Their date went on for hours. They were downing shots and getting very drunk indeed.'

Katie has confessed to having multiple plastic surgery procedures and has spoken publicly about her love of Botox, saying it was like 'going shopping.'

In 2011, Katie revealed she had Botox every four months.
