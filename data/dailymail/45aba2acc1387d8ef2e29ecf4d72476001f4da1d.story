As well as the training scheme, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will today announce plans to turn around the country's most failed hospitals

The brightest doctors could be sent to Harvard and trained-up to take over failing hospitals under proposals to be unveiled by the health secretary.

Jeremy Hunt wants 50 of the best doctors - as well as some senior nurses and businessmen - to be sent on a fast-track course to turn them into top NHS managers.

Mr Hunt is concerned that there is presently a glut of ‘mediocre’ managers in the health service with many of them being paid six-figure sums to run failing organisations.

Earlier this year it emerged that the hospital boss who presided over the worst scandal in the history of the NHS had been given the £100,000 a year job despite having no previous managerial experience.

Martin Yeates - who presided over Mid Staffordshire NHS trust when hundreds of patients died from neglect - was appointed in 2005 because there were no other suitable candidates.

Other health experts have warned that this lack of talent means hospitals have no choice but to appoint poor managers into highly paid roles.

This has led to a ‘revolving door’ 
scenario with bosses moving between hospitals every two or three years 
earning ever higher salaries despite failing to improve care.

Mr Hunt - along with other health professionals - believes that doctors and nurses are far better placed to run hospitals than managers with no medical experience.

Under the proposals to be announced today, a total of £10 million will be invested into the ten-month scheme that will start next Spring.

It is likely to involve eight weeks of leadership training at the prestigious Harvard University, in Boston, USA, although this is still under negotiation.

Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust oversaw a failure in care which lead to the deaths of many patients

It will also include four weeks of classroom training in the UK, six months at a top NHS hospital and a one-month placement in a major company such as Microsoft or BP.

The recruits will not get any formal qualification although they will be guaranteed a senior position on the board of a hospital - most likely one that is currently failing.

Mr Hunt said: ‘If we want this country to be a world-leader, we need a world-leading health service led by the very brightest and best, so I am ambitious about seeking out fresh talent wherever we can find it.

‘Mediocre management and lack of clinical leadership were key contributors to the tragedy at Mid Staffs.

'We are determined to learn that lesson, and train strong leaders drive up standards across the NHS through this cutting-edge programme.’

The doctors and other staff will have to serve at least two years as top NHS managers before leaving to work in the private sector - where pay is far higher.

Professor John Ashton, president of the Faculty of Public Health said: ‘There’s currently a real lack of managers who have done any clinical training.

‘They are very process-driven and it’s all about bed-waits, winter pressures and not whether the health of people has actually improved.

‘What the Government is proposing isn’t new it’s just an extension of what’s already happening. Doctors already occupy senior management roles.'

As well as the 50 NHS doctors, other notable graduates of Harvard include current US President Barack Obama, modernist author T.S. Eliot and Hollywood actor Tommy Lee Jones

But Labour said it was a mistake spending millions sending doctors to the US when so many hospitals were so short-staffed.

Jamie Reed MP, Labour’s shadow health minister said: ‘Patients will struggle to understand this decision.

‘When half of all hospital wards in England will be short-staffed tonight, ministers surely can’t think it’s a priority to send NHS managers to train in the United States.

‘This is the wrong priority and further proof you can’t trust the Tories with the NHS.’

Later today the health secretary will explain how he plans to turn-around 11 failing NHS trusts with the worst death rates in the country.

Top performing NHS managers are to be drafted in to turn around failing hospitals in a move that  Jeremy Hunt said would lead to 'real change'.

The 11 hospitals put in special measures in the wake of the scandal over standards at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust and subsequent Keogh Review will be partnered with the best NHS trusts and managers in a scheme that echoes the 'super-heads' programme to turn around failing schools.

One example is George Elliott Hospital in Nuneaton, which has been placed in special measures and is in 'desperate need' of IT improvements. That hospital has been partnered with University Hospitals Birmingham, which Mr Hunt said has one of the best IT systems in the country.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'We are very aware that there are risks, but what's the alternative?

'I think in a situation like this we have a handful of really inspirational leaders and these people are anxious to help us turn around these failing hospitals, they want to play their part'.

Trusts including North Cumbria, Tameside, Basildon and Thurrock and United Lincolnshire have all been taken over by hit squads after an inspections earlier this summer unearthed poor care.

But six are ‘foundation trusts’ - a coveted status brought in under Labour which was meant to reward the best-performing hospitals.
