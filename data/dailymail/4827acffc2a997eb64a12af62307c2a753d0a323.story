An unlucky student has been banned from driving and fined £250 after he was caught just one milligramme over the drink-drive limit.

Jordan Richmond, 23, drank two-thirds of a pint after driving his Seat Ibiza into a town centre to meet a friend in a pub.

Nottingham Magistrates' Court heard he crashed his car on the way home after losing control in frosty conditions on December 13 last year.

Richmond got out of the vehicle and put on his hazard lights before contacting the emergency services.

But when he was later taken to hospital, a blood sample revealed he was over the drink-drive limit of 80 milligramme in 100 millilitres of blood by just one milligramme.

Richmond, of Watnall, Nottinghamshire, today admitted driving a motor vehicle when his alcohol level was above the limit.

JPs banned the university student from driving for 12 months and ordered him to pay a £250 in fine as well as £85 in court costs and a £25 victim surcharge.

Christopher Charter, chair of the bench, said: 'It is a hard lesson, when you drive you shouldn't drink.

'Here you were over the limit, you were just over the limit, but still over the limit. It's a hard lesson for a young gentleman doing well - don't drink and drive at all.'

The court heard Richmond crashed his vehicle in Long Lane in Watnall after meeting a friend for a pre-Christmas drink.

Prosecutor Sanjay Jerath said the student told police he 'lost control' because conditions on the road were frosty.

Chris Saunders, defending, told the court Richmond was studying Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the University of Derby.

He said he needed his car to get to university and to his job as a multi-skilled engineer at Boots.

Mr Saunders added: 'I hate cases like this because you have one penalty that you have to impose, when that occurs some may say it leads to undue penalties for someone like Jordan Richmond.

'You know that he has been fully co-operative and called the police in the first place.

'Please offer him a driver rehabilitation course because clearly the sooner he gets his licence back the better it will be for all of us.'
