Four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon announced on Thursday that he will retire as a full-time driver at the end of the 2015 season.

The 43-year-old Gordon, of Pittsboro, Indiana, is coming off one of his best seasons in years. He won four times in 2014, including the Brickyard 400.

He said that he was not officially calling it a retirement because there is 'always the possibility I'll compete in selected events, although I currently have no plans to do that'.

Gordon has 92 career Sprint Cup wins and championships in 1995, 1997, 1998 and 2001.

Gordon is third in career victories, trailing Hall of Fame drivers Richard Petty (200) and David Pearson (105). 

He has three Daytona 500 victories and a record five Brickyard 400 wins.

According to Hendrick Motorsports, last year Gordon had 'four victories, three pole positions, 14 top-five finishes and a series-leading 23 top-10s'.

His team also noted that he was the star of the viral video Test Drive, which was viewed more than 43 million times on YouTube. 

Gordon is married to Ingrid Vandebosch and has two children, seven-year-old daughter Ella Sofia and son Leo Benjamin, four.

On Thursday, Gordon tweeted a photo of him letting his racing team know that it would be his last year driving full-time. 

He then posted: 'I'm proud of the career I've had & knew this day would come, but I'll be involved with @TeamHendrick for many years to come.'

Fellow driver, Danica Patrick, responded to the news: 'Crazy to hear that @JeffGordonWeb is retiring! What an amazing career! Glad I got to race with him!'
