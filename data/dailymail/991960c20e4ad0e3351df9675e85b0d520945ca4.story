A British soldier who has served in Afghanistan, Bosnia and Northern Ireland is to be extradited to America over allegations of a $100,000 fraud.

David McIntyre, 41, lost a legal battle in the High Court on Friday, when a judge dismissed medical evidence that showed he is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and now faces a possible 20-year jail sentence.

It is the latest case involving Britain’s controversial extradition treaty with America which critics say discriminates against Britons.

David McIntyre is to be extradited over $100,000 dollar fraud concerning security for an American Peace Group in iraq

The claim against Mr McIntyre concerns a contract to provide security in Iraq for a US peace group for which he was working after he first left the Army.

The former soldier insists he is innocent and is the victim of a plea bargain in which a US official, accused of similar offences, named him to secure a lenient sentence. Mr McIntyre served with the Queen’s Lancashire Regiment from  1996 to 2002. When he left, he  set up his company to provide security to American clients. 

Mr McIntyre enrolled in the Royal Military Police after  his business ended and the allegations emerged last July when he was stationed in Camp Bastion, Afghanistan. 

He said yesterday: ‘I would not volunteer to go to Afghanistan to be killed or maimed if I had a secret slush fund of $100,000 under the bed.’

This newspaper has seen a military psychiatric report which says that Mr McIntyre suffers from PTSD. It warns he is a suicide risk and that there could be ‘potentially tragic’ consequences if he is extradited.

Mr McIntyre, who is being represented by law firm Kaim Todner, added: ‘I think, after serving my country all my life, the least I can expect is to be helped with my PTSD and allowed to prove my innocence in my own country. 

‘I am fearful that I would  take my own life as I would rather be dead than be locked  up in an American prison away from my family.’

Melanie Riley of Friends Extradited said: ‘David clearly needs treatment for his PTSD and if he’s broken any laws he should be tried in the UK.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
