The wife of the £874,000-a-year governor of the Bank of England is urging people to protect the environment by buying organic clothes.

Although they are more expensive, Diana Carney argues it is better to pay more for your outfits than to wear a ‘toxic second skin’ of synthetic garments.

Writing on her blog, Eco Products That Work, economist and green campaigner Mrs Carney said ‘how to green what we wear’ [sic] is a ‘huge issue in our fast fashion world’.

Diana Carney, right, pictured with her husband Mark, urged people to buy organic clothes on her blog, arguing it is better to spend more money on the more expensive garments rather than wear a 'toxic second skin' of synthetic items

She favours the denim brand  Monkee Genes which sells a range  of trousers ‘certified organic by the Soil Association’.

Mrs Carney wrote: ‘Looking at all the benefits of organic fabrics, it’s a wonder we don’t demand them more vociferously.

'Who wants to carry around a toxic second skin each day?’

Mark Carney took over his role as the new Bank of England governor in July

She said that a lot of clothing  production causes a ‘trail of devastation’ in areas where cotton is grown, adding: ‘It is close to Christmas and I do not want to depress you, so let’s think about what we can all do.

‘Most obvious is to buy fewer items, though this is not what the retailers have in mind for us.

‘Second, we can try to source fabrics that are less damaging for the environment and workers.

‘But that’s not easy. Like it or not, our personalities and self-image are closely tied to what we wear. That means that making “sacrifices” in this area can be hard.

‘Low prices tempt us all in (I am by no means exempt here).

'But in the textiles world, prices are nowhere near high enough to reflect the true costs of production.’

British-born Mrs Carney, whose husband Mark is Canadian, previously suggested that reusable fabric gift wrap is preferable to wrapping paper.

She also told how, instead of splashing out on new stationery for their four children’s first day at school in the UK, she recycled pencils and reused ring-binders.

Mr Carney’s pay packet includes a £250,000-a-year housing allowance. After tax, this works out as £11,041 a month towards the rent on their six-bedroom £3million home.
