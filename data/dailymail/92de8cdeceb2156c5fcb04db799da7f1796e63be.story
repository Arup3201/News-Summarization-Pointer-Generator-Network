Barack Obama made it clear to Syrian president Bashar al-Assad yesterday that the U.S. would not tolerate Syria using chemical weapons against its own people.

In a strongly-worded speech on Monday, the U.S. president told the beleaguered Syrian regime:

'The world is watching. The use of chemical weapons is and would be totally unacceptable.'

Obama made it clear that the U.S would not stand by if chemical weapons, such as the deadly nerve gas sarin, were deployed against rebels or the civilian population.

'If you make the tragic mistake of using these weapons, there will be consequences and you will be held accountable.'

The president didn't go into further details about what this would entail. But there are concerns that the Syrian government is getting increasingly desperate to subdue to rebellion in the country, and that this might involve the use of chemical weapons.

CBS News reported on Monday that American intelligence indicates that Assad is preparing the ingredients needed for the production of sarin.

The Syrian regime continues to struggle with internal fighting, that is coming closer to Damascus. The capital's airport was temporarily shut on Monday.

Intelligence analysts are now concerned that government might use extreme measures against its own people.

'We believe that with the regime's grip on power loosening with its 
failure to put down the opposition through conventional means, we have 
an increased concern about the possibility of the regime taking the 
desperate act of using its chemical weapons,' White House spokesman Jay 
Carney told CNN yesterday.

The Syrian authorities have claimed that they will not use chemical weapons. 'Syria has stressed repeatedly that it will not use these types of weapons, if they were available, under any circumstances against its people,' the foreign ministry stated.

U.S. Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, backed up her president:

'I am not going to telegraph any specifics what we do in the event of credible evidence that the Assad regime has resorted to using chemical weapons against their own people, but suffice to say we are certainly planning to take action if that eventuality were to occur.'

The United Nations prepared to evacuate all non-essential staff from Syria on Monday and the European Union is also cutting its activities in the country.
