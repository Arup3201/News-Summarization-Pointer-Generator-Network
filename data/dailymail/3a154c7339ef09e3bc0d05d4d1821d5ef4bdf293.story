Charges may soon be laid in the case of toddler Daniel Thomas who, according to Victoria's coroner, was killed by his baby sitter as his mother failed to intervene.

Homicide detectives have completed their investigation into Daniel's 2003 death in his home in the Victorian town of Myrtleford, north east of Melbourne, which was the subject of a coronial inquest earlier this year.

Victoria Police have confirmed their fresh investigation into the child's death is now complete, and a file has been handed to the Office of Public Prosecutions.

The Seven Network reported on Thursday a murder charge may soon be laid against Daniel's baby sitter Mandy Martyn. 

Daniel's mother Donna who was also implicated in the tragic case may also soon be charged with reckless conduct endangering life.

'Homicide Squad detectives have submitted a brief of evidence to the OPP for opinion in relation to their investigation into the death of Daniel Thomas,' said Victoria Police in a statement.

'Detectives will await the advice from the OPP and as such, we are not in a position to comment any further.'

In July, Victoria's coroner found two-year-old Daniel died from abuse suffered at the hands of Ms Martyn, his baby sitter.

The abuse over six weeks included the toddler being tied to his bed, locked in a cupboard, gagging and beatings, and his head being held under water.

 The coroner also found Ms Thomas contributed to Daniel's death by failing to protect her son.

Jacinta Heffey said Ms Thomas and Daniel moved into Ms Martyn's Myrtleford home about six weeks before he died and throughout the period, Daniel, was subject to horrific abuse.

Ms Heffey said Ms Thomas failed her son by remaining in the home and allowing the abuse to continue.

'She remained under the same roof as someone who systematically mistreated her own son and she manifestly failed to protect or console him,' she said.

'She chose to do nothing and allow the abuse to Daniel to continue.'

Ms Heffey found Daniel's death was possibly caused by strangulation, drowning or a head injury but did not make a ruling on a specific cause.  

Daniel was reported missing by Martyn in October 2003. His remains were found in 2008, buried under the Myrtleford home where he and his mother had previously lived.

The women have denied involvement.
