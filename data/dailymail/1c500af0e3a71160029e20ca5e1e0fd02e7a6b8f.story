American scientists have found that while consumers constantly demand new music, they actually prefer listening to familiar songs.

Research from Washington University in St. Louis examined the power of familiarity on music and found consumers pick songs they know and love even when they believe they would prefer new tracks.

The scientists think their research could help a floundering music industry that is trying to get to grips with new technology and currently puts emphasis on new music, when in fact its focus might be misplaced.

The study investigates the need for novelty and the power of familiarity, in the context of music choice.

Dr Joseph Goodman, professor of marketing at the university's business school and co-author of the study, said: 'In three studies, we examined the power 
of familiarity on music choice and showed that familiarity is a more 
important driver of music choice than more obvious, and commonly tested,
constructs such as liking and satiation - being sick of certain 
music.

'Our results suggest that the emphasis on
novelty in the music domain, by consumers and people often protesting 
the current state of the music business, is probably misplaced.'

The study found familiarity with music positively predicts preference for songs, play lists, and radio stations.

Dr Goodman said: 'Familiarity with music is at least as good, if not a better, predictor of choice as are liking, satiation and regret.'

He said the study could have implications for marketers and the playlists, events, venues and products that they choose to advertise.

Dr Goodman and his co-author at the University of Texas, said: 'We suggest that the need for familiarity 
is driven by consumers' low need for stimulation in the music domain 
and show that when the need for stimulation decreases, the power of 
familiarity significantly increases.'

The findings are to be published in a forthcoming issue of the journal Marketing Letters.

Dr Goodman said: 'In the marketplace and in our pilot 
study, consumers say that they want more novelty when, in fact, their 
choices suggest they do not.'

The study shows that consumers pick music they are familiar with even when they believe they would prefer less familiar music.

Dr Goodman suggests marketer should continue to promote what is familiar to consumers, even though it might not be the most liked.

While the study highlights the importance of familiarity in music, it also says there is a place for new songs and artists.

Consumers have a need for both new and familiar music but they especially prefer familiar music when they are busy working or doing cognitively demanding tasks.

Goodman said the success of services such as Pandora and Spotify will continue because they not only play personalised familiar favorites, but they also introduce people to new music with familiar musical elements.

Research into music preference might become increasingly important as the popularity of digital and web radio grows - 57 million people already listen to web radio each week.
