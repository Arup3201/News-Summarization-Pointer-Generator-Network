The police should be forced to film every encounter they have with the public to prevent a repeat of the Plebgate scandal, a senior Conservative MP has warned.

As three senior officers accused of lying to force Cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell out of office prepare to grilled by MPs later, there are fresh warnings about a ‘crisis of ethics’ in the police service.

Former shadow home secretary David Davies, a close ally of Mr Mitchell, warned the only way to tackle a ‘decline in public trust’ was to force officers to wear cameras and microphones at all times.

Mr Mitchell resigned as the government’s Chief Whip a year ago, just weeks after an altercation at the gates of Downing Street with officers who told him to get off his bike.

In particular he faced calls to resign from three senior officers from the Police Federation who are now accused of lying about a ‘clear the air’ meeting with Mr Mitchell, in which he explained what happened during the altercation.

Inspector Ken MacKaill, from West Mercia Police, Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton from Warwickshire Police and Sergeant Chris Jones from West Midlands Police have been called before the home affairs select committee today.

Prime Minister David Cameron and Home Secretary Theresa May have called on the officers and their constables to issue a full apology to Mr Mitchell, warning the revelations strike at the heart of public trust in the police.

On October 12 last year Andrew Mitchell met three members of the Police Federation to discuss the 'Plebgate' case.

A tape recording of the reveals Mr Mitchell going to great lengths to explain what happened in Downing Street.

He
said: 'I did not say and I give you my word, I give you my word, I did 
not call an officer an f'ing pleb I did not say you are an f'ing moron 
and I did not say you should know your f'ing place.

'I would never speak to anyone like that least of all a police officer and you have my word I never said those things.'

Later
Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton said to Mr Mitchell: 'I appreciate your candour, and we 
appreciate you have gone beyond what you said in, to the media.'

But
minutes later outside the meeting, Inspector Ken MacKaill, from West 
Mercia Police, accused Mr Mitchell of refusing to give any more detail 
of the incident.

Mr MacKaill said: 'I think Mr Mitchell has no option but to resign.

'He is continuing to refuse to elaborate on what happened. I think his position is untenable.'

Mr Davies today warned the Mitchell case was the ‘latest in a long list of police investigations set up to seek the truth but conducted as clumsy cover-ups’.

He suggested that the only way to restore public confidence that officiers uphold truth and the law was to constantly record them.

‘The police put millions of innocent people under surveillance in order to catch a tiny minority of wrongdoers. Perhaps now it is time to make officers wear a camera and microphone while on duty,’ Mr Davies wrote in The Times.

‘When they tried this in California, use of force by police officers dropped by two-thirds in a year. This technology could also help to defend police officers who have vexatious claims made against them.’

Mr Davis' intervention comes as the row between police and politicians shows no sign of being resolved.

Mr MacKaill, Mr Hinton and Mr Jones will be questioned at a Home Affairs Select Committee inquiry into the row.

As the plebgate row reached fever pitch, Mr Mitchell met the three senior members of the Police Federation.

It followed a leaked police log claiming he called officers ‘f***ing plebs’.

He has always denied using the word ‘pleb’ but admits swearing at officers who told him he could not ride his bicycle through the main gates of Downing Street on September 19 last year.

On October 12, a meeting was set up to ‘clear the air’ between the MP for Sutton Coldfield, and members of his local police forces.

Mr Mitchell recorded the meeting, in which he made clear to the officers exactly what he said during the altercation.

But Mr MacKaill told journalists after the meeting that the senior Tory was 'continuing to refuse to elaborate on what happened'.

Doubts: CCTV footage of the original exchange between Mr Mitchell and police officers at the gates of Downing Street raised questions about the official police log

The Independent Police Complaints Commission last week accused the officers of pursuing a political campaign against Mr Mitchell in protest at government spending cuts, and raised issues of ‘honesty and integrity’.

The IPCC said West Mercia Police were wrong to conclude that the three men had no case to answer for misconduct or gross misconduct.

The three officers this week said they were sorry for 
‘poor judgment’ in addressing TV cameras to call for Mr Mitchell to quit
the Cabinet, despite reassuring him at a private meeting that they 
appreciated his explanation of the infamous row at the gates of Downing 
Street.

However it fell short of the full 
apology demanded by Mr Cameron and rejects criticism from the 
independent police watchdog which questioned the officers’ ‘honesty and 
integrity’.

In the joint statement, Mr
MacKaill, Mr Hinton and Mr Jones said: ‘We are making this statement in
response to public concern generated by the widely reported outcome of 
West Mercia's investigation into matters arising from the meeting we had
with Andrew Mitchell MP in his constituency on 12th October 2012.

‘The reputation of, and public confidence in, the police service is of immense concern to each of us.

‘We
acknowledge the investigation’s criticism relating to our poor 
judgement in talking to the media following the meeting with Andrew 
Mitchell, for which we take this opportunity to apologise.

‘We
would like to emphasise (as we did to the investigation) that in no way
did any of us ever plan or intend to mislead anyone about what occurred
during this meeting or otherwise.’
