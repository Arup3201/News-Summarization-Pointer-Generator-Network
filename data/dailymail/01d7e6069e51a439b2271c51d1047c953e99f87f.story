Paddy McNair had to be stapled up on the pitch during Manchester United's FA Cup clash with Yeovil after a nasty clash of heads with Kieffer Moore.

The young defender went up for a header with the opposing striker in the 20th minute at Huish Park but both went down holding their face.

United's club physio Neil Hough and club doctor Steve McNally then rushed onto the pitch to provide treatment as McNair had his head stapled.

McNair, 19, appeared to show no signs of concussion and so was allowed to play on, albeit with a bandage around his head.

In the collision Yeovil striker Moore damaged his nose as the third-round fixture was temporarily stopped while the duo lay down injured.

The Northern Irish defender broke through into the United team this season amid an injury crisis at Old Trafford, and was brought in for the cup clash by Louis van Gaal after missing the draw with Stoke on New Year's Day.
