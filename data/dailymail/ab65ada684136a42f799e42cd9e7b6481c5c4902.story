Liberal-led governments in Australia are 'bad for women', according to a new report that claims to show gender imbalance in boardrooms across governments is getting worse.

Women on Boards has released its 2015 Boardroom Diversity Index, which shows  the superannuation industry, sport and not-for-profit sectors are  improving gender balance at a board level.

But the federal, Queensland and Western Australian governments are falling behind, according to Women on Boards director Claire Braund.

'It's hard not to conclude that conservative leaning governments are bad for women,' Ms Braund said.

'It is clear to us that the message is starting to hit home in a number of important areas in the economy - in particular superannuation and ASX companies - but unfortunately not with some governments.' 

Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women Michaelia Cash has called the scorecard results 'false and absurd', the Australian Financial Review reports.

The number of women on boards fell by just 0.6 percent from the 91 federal government boards included in the research.

But Women on Boards also pointed to the 2014 Australian Government Gender Balance on Boards Report that showed the number of female board members was down by two per cent on the previous year across 387 government boards.

'This is a worrying trend that, if it continues, could easily move to five or 10 per cent and erode the excellent work done by the previous federal government to move women into board roles via its Boardlinks program,' Ms Braund said.

Queensland posted the biggest loss of with a loss of 13.6 percent in the number of women serving on the boards of state owned corporations, while Western Australia followed with minus 3.2 percent.

The research revealed gender balance on governing bodies of universities, national sporting organisations, affordable housing companies, Medicare Locals, State Health Services (NSW, Vic and Qld) and State Owned Corporations in NSW, Victoria and South Australia was above 30 per cent.

Senator Cash said any dip in the number of women in government board roles was a byproduct of bringing 460 boards down to 387 for cost-cutting measures. 

'Over 800 board positions were abolished between 30 June 2013 and 30 June 2014. This in turn has impacted on the gender balance of government boards,' she said.
