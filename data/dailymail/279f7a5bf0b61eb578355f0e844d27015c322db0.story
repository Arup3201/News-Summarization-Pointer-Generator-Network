Troubled former England footballer Paul Gascoigne had to be helped to his feet after he lost control of a golf buggy he was driving and crashed into a ditch.

The 47-year-old, who was admitted to hospital a fortnight ago after an alcoholic relapse, was driving the 15mph buggy when it swerved off the course and into a grassy ditch at a golf course in Bournemouth.

He was said to be dazed but unhurt after the incident, which happened at the Playgolf course in the south coast resort at 10.30am on Sunday.

Peter Gilbert, head of operations at Playgolf Bournemouth, confirmed Gazza was at the wheel of the £18-a-time buggy, though he said it hadn't been hired out in his name

Peter Gilbert, head of operations at Playgolf Bournemouth, confirmed Gazza was at the wheel of the £18-a-time buggy, though he said it hadn't been hired out in his name.

He told MailOnline the footballer and father of three was a regular and popular visitor to the course, which is near his home in the millionaire's enclave of Sandbanks, and said they never had any problems with him.

Mr Gilbert said: 'He comes here once or twice a week, every week, and we never have any trouble with him - he's always happy to have his picture taken with children.'

Last month, Gascoigne was taken to hospital after he was pictured clutching a bottle of gin in the street near his rented apartment in Sandbanks, Dorset.

He was also seen wandering the streets outside his expensive apartment block, holding a carrier bag full of cans of Stella Artois, and sitting with his head in his hands.

Neighbours called 999 for help after finding the former Spurs and Lazio star slumped against a wall, and an ambulance arrived to take the former England star to hospital.

After pictures emerged showing Gascoigne looking much older than 47, looking gaunt with sunken eyes, QPR manager Harry Redknapp, who also lives in Sandbanks, offered him the chance to work alongside him in football.

He said: 'I saw him about a month ago and said "I'll pick you up in the mornings, Gazza, come training with me and do a bit of work with the kids". I’d love it if he could do that. It's an open invitation.

'He's a great lad and it's sad to see what’s happened to him and how he's looking at the moment.'

In a TV documentary shown last September, Gascoigne described the pain of fearing he might start drinking again, despite knowing it could kill him. 

He was first sent to rehab in 1998 by Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson, having found been unconscious after drinking 32 shots of whisky.

Since then he has fought a public battle against both drink and drugs, particularly after leaving the world of professional football a decade ago.

Last year his friends DJ Chris Evans and ex-England cricketer Ronnie Irani paid for Gascoigne to attend a rehab clinic in Arizona.

And for the past four years, Gazza has been living in Poole, where he is an occasional patient at the nearby Providence Project rehabilitation centre.

Hunter Davies, who co-wrote the former star's 2004 autobiography, said: 'He doesn’t even like alcohol. He hates the taste of it.

'I’ve been with him when he’s poured it into flower pots, because he finds it so revolting. But then he will get depressed, and just want to get obliterated.'
