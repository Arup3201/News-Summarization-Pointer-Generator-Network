An amazing video has captured rare footage of giant Humboldt squid making their bodies ‘flash’ different colours.

The footage also reveals the aggressive mating rituals carried out by the deep sea creatures.

It is one of the only videos ever captured showing how these squid communicate and interact with each other underwater. 

Scientists at Stanford’s Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove, California have revealed remarkable footage of giant Humboldt squid. In a video the creatures are seen 'flashing' each other to communicate (seen here). They are also seen performing an aggressive mating ritual

Giant Humboldt squid can grow to the size of a man, up to six feet (1.8 metres) long, and are incredibly dangerous, according to National Geographic.

Previous attempts to observe them have seen them rip the masks off divers and attack lighting and camera equipment.

According to the researchers, the ability of the squid to flash is not due to bioluminescence, but the use of muscle fibres.

‘A unique feature of all coleoid cephalopods (squid, cuttlefish and octopus) is the ability to change skin color through the use of neuromuscular chromatophores,’ the researchers write in their paper.

‘These small organs are composed of an elastic pigment sac that can be expanded, and thereby made visible to an observer, through the action of a ring of radial muscle fibres.

‘These muscle fibres are directly innervated [supplied by nerves] by motor neurons with cell bodies in the chromatophore lobes of the brain.'

But in the latest research, carried out by scientists from Stanford’s Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove, California, scientists were able to mount cameras on three of the animals - known as Crittercams.

They did this by cutting ‘sweaters’ from child-size swim shirts and slipping them over the body of the animals with a tube, leaving their arms, fins and tentacles free.

This allowed them to observe some of the interactions taking place underwater.

Of most interest, seen in the latter half of the video, is how the squid flash from red to white to red again in order to communicate.

According to lead author of the study Hannah Rosen, this could be an attempt to communicate or a way to petition prospective mates.

They can also flash quickly in order to camouflage themselves in the water, matching the pattern of sunlight undulating through the water.

The squid were fitted with cameras attached to child-sized shirts to capture the extremely rare footage. But researchers aren't quite sure what the purpose of the flashing is. And the aggressive mating ritual, seen here, was also a bit of a mystery to the scientists

In the first half of the video the researchers noted ‘arms-to-arms’ contact between squid, which they took to be mating attempts - although they were unclear if they were successful.

The sex of the squid fitted with cameras was unknown, while it was not clear which arms or tentacles were used in the interactions.

‘Splaying of arms was also observed in several instances during interactions that did not appear to be directly related to mating,’ the researchers noted.

‘In one case, a pair of secondary squid were interacting and as the primary squid approached, they both turned to face the oncoming squid and opened their arms as far as possible for several seconds and then jetted backward, away from the camera.’

The scientists hope to employ more Crittercams in future to further study the odd and aggressive behaviour of the squid.

The footage is extremely rare because the squid are very dangerous. Previous attempts to observe them have seen them rip the masks off divers and attack lighting and camera equipment
