A spokesman for Chanel, whose No 5 has been on sale for 93 years, said adapting would be a 'challenge'

Some of the world’s most popular perfumes - including Chanel No 5 - are under threat from EU regulations branded ‘absurd’ by manufacturers.

Brussels is planning to target perfumiers with ingredient bans and labelling requirements aimed at protecting a tiny fraction of consumers who suffer from allergies.

The rules will force perfume makers to reformulate many of their scents and change the packaging of their products, leading to extra costs.

Leading brands admit coping with the changes - which the EU accepts will benefit just one to three per cent of users - will be a ‘challenge’.

Some of the 12 ingredients regarded as the pillars of the luxury perfume industry - including coumarin, found in tropical tonka beans; and eugenol, from rose oil - could be restricted.

Citra, found in lemon and tangerine oils, plus atranol and chloroatranol, are likely to be banned.

A spokesman for Chanel, whose No 5 has been on sale for 93 years and is the world’s best-selling perfume, said: ‘Adapting is a challenge but it is precisely the talent of our ‘nose’ to be able to preserve the qualities and olfactive (scent) identity of our perfumes while also taking into account new regulatory constraints.’

Hermes as well as Dior and Guerlain - both owned by LVMH - are preparing themselves for the new rules by progressively changing their formulas.

The changes have angered Frederic Malle, who founded the French luxury perfume company Editions de Parfums Frederic Malle.

He said: ‘If we ban citra from perfumes, of which certain elements are allergens, we should ban orange juice. It is absurd. We should not ban nature, only learn how to live with it.

‘It can take more than six months to reformulate a perfume, and a minimum of some 30 tests ... and this is precious time that cannot be spent on creating new perfumes. So to protect a small portion of the population, we are making the rest suffer.’

The European Commission is planning to ban, in its original form, oak moss and tree moss, two of the most widely used base notes which give perfumes depth and help make the scents last.

Such mosses can be found in Chanel’s No.5 and Dior’s Miss Dior but the brands have been working on using altered versions, stripped of the molecules atranol and chloroatranol, regarded as potential allergens by the EU.

The EU is also planning on banning HICC, a popular synthetic molecule which replicates the ‘lily of the valley’ smell.

In 2012, an advisory report had recommended severely limiting the use of natural ingredients, on the basis that one to three per cent of people could be allergic.

‘We understand that drastic reductions
 in the authorised concentrations of these ingredients would have 
created major disruptions to the industry,’ said David Hudson, spokesman
 for consumer policy at the European Commission.

The new rules, which will effectively take the form of an amendment to the Cosmetics Regulation adopted in 2009, have undergone a 12-week public consultation that ended on May 14, the results of which are expected to be published by early July.

The consultation triggered more than 200 responses from industry players, consumers’ associations and researchers, which the EU said was a relatively high number.

A draft proposal could be given to EU member states by August and by the following month a final version sent for scrutiny by the European Council and Parliament, which have three months to oppose it.

The regulations will also require perfume makers to inform consumers about potential allergens contained in their products but it has not yet decided how this will work in practice and how many of them should be labelled.

It has raised the number of ingredients that must be labelled from 26 to more than 80 and is looking at ways to allow perfume makers to provide information about them on the Internet or through smartphone scans to avoid having to cram them on the package.
