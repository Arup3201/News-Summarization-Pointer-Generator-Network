Jailed: Azael Stevens has been ordered held without bail after allegedly shooting three women, including whose caregivers who died

A 22-year-old man recently released from prison went on a gun rampage allegedly killing his grandmother and great-grandmother.

Azael Stevens also shot another woman in the face so he could steal her car and speed away from police.

Stevens, who was released from prison in July, was captured on Sunday after being found in the stolen vehicle.

Investigators have not named the two victims, but neighbours told the Ocala Star-Banner that they had raised Stevens since he was a little boy.

The third shooting victim was 47-year-old Jacqueline Gonzalez who was staying at the house in Ocala, Florida.

She was shot in front of her eight-year-old son who was unharmed in the triple shooting.

Police said Stevens had returned to live with his elderly caregivers on Friday - two months after being released from jail on assault and drug charges.

Neighbours remember seeing him being hugged and welcomed home by his grandmother.

Steven
 Johnson told the Star-Banner: 'He was raised by them since he was a 
little boy,' said Steven Johnson, who lived next door to the slain women
 for 16 years.

He added: 'We used to watch him and 
feed him when he was younger and they were at work,' said Johnson, who 
said the women were from Panama.

Processed: Stevens was arrested on Sunday after the gun rampage

An arrest report reveals that he woke up Gonzalez in the early hours of the morning and demanded the keys to her car.

The shouting led to his grandmother and great-mother becoming involved.

One woman was found dead in a recliner, the other died on the couch.

Authorities said that Gonzalez gave Stevens her car keys, but he shot her in the face anyway.

House of horrors: Stevens had arrived at the Marion County home on Friday. Two days later, his grandmother and great-grandmother were dead

He continued looking for items around the house before leaving in her car.

Gonzalez's 8-year-old son was sleeping in a back room and ran out to see his mother being shot.

He was not injured and, with his mother, he ran to a neighbour's home screaming for help.

Johnson
 told the paper: 'They were banging on the door. The little boy was 
crying and really scared. We called 911 and they were here in three or 
four minutes.'

'We were all worried. We didn't know if the guy was still around or was coming back.'

Stevens was booked into the Marion County Jail on two counts of felony murder, one count each of attempted felony murder, grand theft auto, robbery and driving with a suspended license.

He was being held without bond.
