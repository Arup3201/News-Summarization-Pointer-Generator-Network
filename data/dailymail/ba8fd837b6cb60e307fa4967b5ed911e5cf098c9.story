Baroness Warsi has called for a ban on selling arms to Israel following her resignation from the Cabinet

Baroness Warsi’s call for a ban on selling arms to Israel received its most high-profile Tory backing last night.

A day after her shock departure from Cabinet, former international development secretary and ex-Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell demanded an arms embargo in response to the ‘misery and carnage’ in Gaza.

His intervention piles further pressure on David Cameron following the Foreign Office minister’s resignation on Tuesday over the Government’s position on the crisis, which she described as ‘morally unjustifiable’.

A number of Tory backbenchers praised her ‘principled’ stand and said they hoped it would encourage the Government to consider her call for an arms ban.

Yesterday, Mr Mitchell, who was forced to resign last year over the ‘Plebgate’ row, became the most senior party figure yet to back Baroness Warsi. 

Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s World at One, he said the current ceasefire in Gaza must be made permanent before talks move on to addressing the wider issues in the Middle East peace process.

On whether there is a case for an arms embargo on Israel, Mr Mitchell said: ‘Yes, I would have thought there is a strong case for trying to ensure that weapons getting into this conflict are minimised as much as possible. I think it’s right an embargo should be considered.

‘On the issue of Gaza, there is a quite extraordinary level of misery and carnage going on. Britain needs to play a role on a whole series of different levels.’

Arms export licenses worth £42million have been granted to 130 UK defence manufacturers to sell military equipment, including drones and armoured vehicles, to Israel in the past four years.

The Tories are also coming under pressure from their Coalition partners to consider an embargo on Israel. Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, said he believed Israel has every right to defend itself from rocket attacks by Hamas – but that its operation had ‘overstepped the mark’.

He described the strikes on three UN schools in Gaza as ‘outrageous’ and added: ‘That’s why I believe that the export licences should now be suspended.’

Party colleague Vince Cable, the Business Secretary, said: ‘We have been making this case inside Government but have not yet been able to get agreement for this position. I hope and expect that to change shortly.’

A Number 10 spokesman said: ‘A review of export licences to Israel is under way following the sustained barrage of rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel which prompted Israel to launch Operation Protective Edge.

‘Since then no new licences have been issued for use by the Israeli military. Suspending export licences is not a decision we take lightly and it is right that we examine the facts fully.

Last night it was reported that Foreign Office minister Hugo Swire had also considered quitting in protest over policy on Gaza. Channel 4 News named him as the government figure who had discussed resignation with Lady Warsi.

But Mr Swire denied he was ready to resign, saying: ‘I want to be very clear – I have absolutely no intention of resigning whatsoever.’

Announcing replacements for Lady Warsi, No10 said her title as ‘senior minister of state’, which was created specially for her, would be scrapped. Her Foreign Office job will be taken by Baroness Anelay, while her other role as faith minister will be taken over by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles.

Mr Mitchell admitted on the BBC that Lady Warsi’s resignation was ‘undoubtedly a loss’, adding: ‘She’s a very important part of the Conservative Party’s DNA. She reaches parts... which others in the Conservative Party don’t reach so easily.’

But he suggested she should have stayed in government to argue for a tougher line on Israel. ‘You should fight your corner,’ said Mr Mitchell. ‘Her voice needs to be heard.’
