Gerard Pique took advantage of the international break by going to a basketball game with his popstar girlfriend Shakira.

The Barcelona defender was axed from the Spain squad by Vicente del Bosque following their World Cup humiliation in Brazil.

Pique, along with Fernando Torres and Juan Mata, were all left out of the new-look squad for the Euro 2016 qualifier with Macedonia.

However, the 27-year-old certainly didn't appear down in the dumps as he watched Slovenia against USA in the FIBA World Cup quarter-finals in Barcelona on Tuesday.

Pique laughed and joked with his girlfriend and seemed to be enjoying the time away from international duty.

The former Manchester United man is due to return to action on Saturday when Barcelona take on Athletic Bilbao.
