MPs are set to visit the Falklands next month amid simmering tension between Britain and Argentina over ownership of the islands.

In a move that could anger Buenos Aires still further, members of the Defence Select Committee said they would be visiting the islands next month.

They want to inspect Britain's military force there, which has recently been joined by the Duke of Cambridge on a six-week tour as a search and rescue pilot.

Yesterday Sean Penn was condemned as ‘moronic’ after he attacked Britain’s ownership of the Falkland Islands following a meeting with the president of Argentina.

The American actor and ex-husband of Madonna, who is known for his Left-wing views, said Britain’s continuing hold on the islands was ‘colonialist, ludicrous and archaic’.

Despite having no previous knowledge or connection with the Falklands – which he referred to as ‘the Malvinas Islands of Argentina’ – he called on Britain to relinquish them.

The Defence Select Committee visit comes ahead of the 30th anniversary of the conflict over the Falklands, The Times reported.

'Given that we have a significant military presence in the Falklands... it is only right that the defence committee goes and sees first-hand what taxpayers' money is being spent on and what it is doing,' committee member Thomas Docherty said.

'One of my priorities given the historic connection this year will be the anniversary. It is important this year that we recognise the sacrifices made.'

An Argentine war veterans spokesman described the visit as 'another provocation'.

Juan Mendicino, president of the association that represents Falklands veterans, told The Times: 'Argentina does not want war - it wants peace and the return of our islands through diplomatic negotiation.

'But the only thing that the English think about is war. We don't want visitors from your parliament.

'We want the UN to intervene as it has done in disputes across the world.'

There has been months of escalating rhetoric between Britain and Argentina.

Most recently, Argentina has said it had intelligence that a Vanguard submarine had been sent to the area and demanded to know whether it was carrying warheads.

'Thus far the UK refuses to say whether it is true or not,' foreign minister Hector Timerman told a press conference.

'Are there nuclear weapons or are there not? The information Argentina has is that there are these nuclear weapons.'

Mr Timerman said Britain was using an 'unjustified defence of self-determination' to maintain a military base on the Falklands, which allowed it to dominate the Atlantic.

But Britain's ambassador to the UN, Sir Mark Lyall Grant branded the idea that the UK was 'militarising' the situation 'manifestly absurd'.

In recent months, Prime Minister David Cameron and President Cristina Kirchner have traded barbs prompting United Nations secretary general Ban Ki-moon to issue a statement expressing 'concern about the increasingly strong exchanges'.

Tempers flared after Britain deployed one of its most modern destroyers, HMS Dauntless, to the region, although it insisted the move was merely routine.

The Duke of Cambridge's arrival in the Falklands for a posting as an RAF search and rescue pilot has further infuriated Buenos Aires.

And there were protests after the website of Falklands newspaper the Penguin News ran a photo of Mrs Kirchner labelled 'bitch'.
