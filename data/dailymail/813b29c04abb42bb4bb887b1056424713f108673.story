Controversial: Russia's President Vladimir Putin has rejected criticism of the imprisonment of the female punk band Pussy Riot by claiming 'they would be at home doing housework' if they had not 'broken the law'

Russia's President Vladimir Putin has rejected criticism of the imprisonment of the female punk band Pussy Riot by claiming 'they would be at home doing housework if they had not broken the law'.

Speaking to a group of foreign Russian experts, Putin said the bands three members deserved their fate because they threatened the moral foundations of Russia.

During the two-hour dinner, the president, now in his 13th 
year running Russia, became animated only when asked about the band.

According to The Independent, Putin said: 'Whether the sentence was too much or too little is not for me to 
judge,' he said. 'That is a matter for the court.'

He added: 'If they had not broken the law, they would now
 be at home, doing the housework, or back at their jobs.'

Maria Alyokhina, 24, and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, 22, were convicted of 
‘hooliganism motivated by religious hatred’ in August, after they burst 
into a cathedral to protest against Vladmir Putin.

They were sentenced to two years in jail for the stunt, a punishment that many in the West said was too harsh.

A third convicted band member, Yekaterina Samutsevich, was released on 
appeal when a court suspended her sentence after her lawyer argued that 
she had been pulled away from the cathedral's altar before the protest 
song began.

At yesterday's dinner Putin asked why Westerners who criticized Russia for sending 
two of the young women to labor camps far from Moscow had not come out 
in support of a jailed American who made an anti-Muslim hate film.

'Do
 you want to support people with such views? If you do, then why do you 
not support the guy who is sitting in prison for the film about the 
Muslims?' the president shot back.

This
 was an apparent reference to 'The Innocence of Muslims', a hate 
video that triggered violent protests across the Islamic world when it 
was aired on the Internet.

An
 actress in the film has identified an Egyptian-born Californian, Mark 
Basseley Youssef, as its author. Youssef is currently detained on 
suspicion of violating his probation terms for a bank fraud conviction.

'We
 have red lines beyond which starts the destruction of the moral 
foundations of our society,' Putin went on. 'If people cross this line 
they should be made responsible in line with the law.'

He described Pussy Riot's protest as 'an act of group sex aimed at hurting religious feelings'.

Putin's
 comments came amid a wider clampdown on dissent in Russia, which has 
included arrests of opposition leaders on criminal charges and tighter 
controls on media.

This
 has led to fears that the political system, which is highly centralized
 under the Kremlin, is becoming increasingly ossified and intolerant.

Putin's comments were made during a seven-course meal with the Valdai Club of foreign journalists
 and academics at his Stalin-era residence in a wooded compound outside 
Moscow.

The Valdai 
members were kept waiting in a separate room for an hour and a half for 
the meeting, while Putin met a group of factory workers and teachers 
from the Volga region to discuss religious cults.

Putin spent most of his time carefully explaining how his country was trying to improve the business climate and diversify the economy away from its heavy dependence on oil and gas by promoting high-tech industries.

The Kremlin chief said he had 'mixed feelings' about a $55 billion state-sponsored takeover of the country's number three private oil producer TNK-BP last week because it increased state-controlled Rosneft's domination of the energy sector.

But Putin said he acted to help BP and put an end to 'fistfights' between the British oil major and its four Soviet-born oligarch partners.

'We tried not to get involved, but when BP managers came to me and the government and said we want to cooperate with Rosneft, we could not say no,' said Putin. Rosneft is run by a longtime close Putin ally, Igor Sechin, and the deal will give BP a stake of nearly 20 per cent.

Putin said he was implementing new laws and reforming the courts to reach a target of moving Russia up from its 112th place in the annual World Bank rankings for ease of doing business - below Pakistan - to a top 20 place by 2018.

Putin deflected a question about the possible stagnation of the system by saying Russia was re-introducing direct elections for state governors, making it easier for political parties to register and allowing citizens to petition the state Duma (parliament) directly with proposals.

Many of the same faces who worked with Putin when he was deputy mayor of St Petersburg in the early 1990s are still in senior positions in Moscow in the government and in state companies.

But Putin said around two-thirds of the members of the government had been changed when he returned to the Kremlin earlier this year, swapping places with his protégé Dmitry Medvedev, who is now prime minister.

'I prefer to choose qualified, experienced people who have proved they can do well,' the president explained. He rejected suggestions that there were any disputes inside the government in the wake of the departure just over a year ago of long-time Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin.

Putin insisted that Russia would continue to give a high priority to growing its trade with its top business partner China, aiming to boost bilateral business to $100 billion a year from current levels of $83.5 billion.

Beijing and Moscow were also keen to do as much trade as possible in their national currencies, he said, noting that the rouble was fully convertible and that it was a 'matter of time' until the yuan was, too.

By contrast, he berated the European Union for its 'ridiculous' slowness in agreeing a visa-free regime for Russia and attacked Brussels for not taking him up on an offer of cooperation on a new satellite navigation system between the European Galileo system and Russia's GLONASS project.

'The EU has a visa-free regime with certain Latin American countries, and I don't think their crime levels are any less than ours,' he said. 'I don't understand this approach.'

Putin also had a ready answer for a questioner who enquired how he would stop an exodus of talented, qualified young people to the West. It was entirely normal, he said, for young people to study and work in other countries where there was more money or a good education on offer.

And what would the president want historians to highlight as the greatest achievement of his third term in the Kremlin?

'You know, I am never guided by a possible assessment of my work,' Putin said, before highlighting how the economy had doubled in size under his stewardship, average incomes had soared, gold reserves were the world's fourth biggest, the birth rate had increased - all what he termed 'modest, positive changes ... but not enough'.

'We need to create a democratic, effective system of governance so that people feel they are participating,' he said. 'We need to create an effective economy which is looking forward and to guarantee the country's security. I am sure we are capable of solving all these problems.'
