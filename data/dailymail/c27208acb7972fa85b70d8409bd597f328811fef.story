If recent pictures are anything to go by, Taylor Swift and Calvin Harris are set to become pop's biggest power couple. 

After a month of rumours about a possible romance, the twosome were spotted hanging out in Whole Foods in Nashville, Tennessee earlier this week.

But if 31-year-old DJ Calvin is to become the new Mr Taylor Swift then he should be aware that he might end up becoming the subject of one of her songs.

Taylor and Calvin have been rumoured to have been dating for the last month and were spotted together in Nashville, Tennessee

Taylor is well known for writing about her love life, with her former boyfriends John Mayer, Harry Styles and Joe Jonas all having inspired tracks on her various albums.

Taylor herself even admits that her relationships do inspire her musically. However, she's always careful not to go into specifics.

She once said: 'For me, I have a really strict personal policy that I never name names. So anybody saying that a song is about a specific person is purely speculating. And they’re going to do that.' 

Here we look back over her previous relationships... and the songs they were thought to have inspired.  

Taylor dated Joe Jonas in 2008 and is thought to have written several songs about him after he dumped her over the phone 

Joe Jonas

Taylor and Joe dated in 2008 and it's thought that he inspired her whole Fearless album. 

'Forever and Always and 'You're Not Sorry,' were thought to have been about their messy split. 

Taylor previously revealed that Joe dumped her in a 27 second long phone call, but he countered her claims saying he would have spoken for longer had she not hung up on him.

Joe actually wrote an open letter about the situation saying: 'For those who have expressed concern over the ’27-second’ phone call … I called to discuss feelings with the other person.

'Those feelings were obviously not well-received. I did not end the conversation. Someone else did. 

'Phone calls can only last as long as the person on the other end of the line is willing to talk. A phone call can be pretty short when someone else ends the call. 

'The only difference in this conversation was that I shared something the other person did not want to hear. There were later attempts at communication that had no response.'

Taylor Swift broke her promise not to name and shame when she wrote her hit song Dear John about her ex John Mayer 

John Mayer 

Taylor wasn't exactly subtle when she wrote about fellow singer John Mayer who she dated briefly in 2009.

She called the song 'Dear John' and she didn't hold back in expressing her feelings for the man who went on to date both Jennifer Aniston and Katy Perry. 

Some of the lyrics to the song include: 'You paint me a blue sky. And go back and turn it to rain. And I lived in your chess game. But you changed the rules everyday.' 

Taylor also references the fact that she was too young (at the time she was only 19) to be caught up with an older man. 

John, now 37, has since said that he didn't feel he deserved to have such a harsh song written about him. Telling Rolling Stone: 'It made me feel terrible, because I didn't deserve it. 

'I'm pretty good at taking accountability now and I never did anything to deserve that. It was a really lousy thing for her to do.'

Taylor dated Taylor Lautner in 2009 and is thought to have written Back To December to apologise to the actor having dumped him 

Taylor Lautner

Taylor and Taylor dated in 2009 and starred in the film Valentine's Day together. And the actor then became the subject of her song, 'Back To December.' 

In the lyrics Taylor reveals how she dumped a boyfriend - thought to be Mr Lautner - and left the roses that he'd given her to die.

Taylor never actually admitted to having dated the actor however, when she was quizzed about their romance on the Ellen Show she remained particularly coy on the subject.  

Taylor and Jake Gyllenhaal may have looked like the perfect all American couple but in fact they split after just a few months of dating 

Jake Gyllenhaal 

Jake and Taylor enjoyed a four month romance at the end of 2010 going into 2011 and she wrote 'The Last Time,' about him.

Taylor said of the song: '[It] is about an experience I had with someone who was kind of this unreliable guy. 

'You never know when he's going to leave, you never know when he's going to come back, but he always does come back.'

It is also thought that she wrote 'All Too Well,' about the actor. In the lyrics of the song she references how she left her scarf at his sisters house. 

When Jake and Taylor went out it was widely reported that the pair had spent time with his sibling Maggie Gyllenhaal who the popstar got on well with.  

Taylor dated Connor Kennedy in 2012 and speaks favourably about their relationship in Begin Again

Connor Kennedy 

Taylor went out with Connor Kennedy - a descendant of the late JFK - in 2012  and it's thought she wrote the song Begin Again about him.

Taylor said of the song: '[It is] when you've gotten through a really bad relationship and you finally dust yourself off.' 

The pair only lasted a few months with Taylor admitting just before they split that she perhaps didn't know that much about love. 

She said in an interview: 'I don't know how to have a normal relationship because I try to act normal, love from a normal place and live a normal life.

But there is sort of an abnormal magnifying glass, like telescope lens, on everything that happens between me and anybody else. 

'I don't really know that much about love, it turns out.' 

One of Taylor's most high profile relationships was with Harry Styles who she is thought to have written two songs about 

Aubin & Willis Portland Sweater

This is the Taylor Swift sweater that launched a thousand imitations. Back when she was still dating 1Direction singer Harry Styles, Swift wore this Aubin & Willis Portland sweater featuring a fox, and suddenly everyone in the world was clamoring to get one.

Swift is constantly setting fashion trends no matter what she's wearing. The pop star's preppy, buttoned-up style is a favorite both with her tween fans and their moms. This sweater is a perfect example of Taylor's cute and kitschy taste applied to tasteful and modest items of clothing.

Of course, considering the major fox mania, this sweater has been totally sold out for awhile now, though you can snap up some similar items from the brand with a click to the left. If you have to have this foxy little piece of knitwear right now, we've got some picks in the edit below that are the spitting image!

Harry Styles

Given that Harry Styles and Taylor Swift actually only dated for about two and a half months she has got quite a lot of mileage out of their union. 

Taylor is thought to have written two songs about Harry including: 'I knew you were trouble,' from her Red album and 'Out Of The Woods,' from 1989. 

Out Of The Woods references the fact that the pair went on a skiing holiday during their brief romance which started in December 2012. 

Harry said of Taylor writing about him: 'I think we always say, when we [One Direction] wrote the album, that we write from personal experiences, so it would be hypocritical of us to be like “oh you can’t write a song.

'She’s really good so… They’re good songs. So I’m lucky in that sense.' 

Taylor herself has never actually confirmed the songs were about the One D singer.
