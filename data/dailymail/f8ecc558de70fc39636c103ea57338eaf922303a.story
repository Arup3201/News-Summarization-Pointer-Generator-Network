Manchester United's woes deepen for new manager David Moyes after back-to-back Premier League defeats put their title defence in serious doubt.

Everton and Newcastle both celebrated unlikely wins at Old Trafford last week and now United fans are beginning to wonder whether they will finish in the top four, let alone win the league.

But can the Scot turn things around?

Sportsmail columnist Martin Keown is on hand this Thursday to answer the all-important questions.

Pain game: Manchester United slumped to back-to-back defeats as they crashed at home to Newcastle on Saturday

Under pressure: New Manchester United boss David Moyes is not enjoying the best of times in the league but will be hoping his players pick themselves back up when they travel to Aston Villa this weekend

Who should United target in the January transfer window? 
Will they kick-start a revival at Aston Villa? And can Moyes get the 
best out of Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie at the same time?

Things are starting to liven up at 
the bottom of the table too. West Ham entertain fellow strugglers 
Sunderland in a must-win clash for both sides. With a potential selection crisis, should under-fire boss Sam Allardyce risk recovering striker Andy Carroll this Saturday at Upton Park?

Arsenal continue to lead the table but will they maintain their challenge when they take on Manchester City in Saturday's lunchtime kick-off?

And must Tottenham defeat rivals Liverpool at White Hart Lane to keep their top four hopes alive?

Red alert: Liverpool take on Tottenham this weekend - will they keep up their winning form?
