Manuel Pellegrini has reminded Bayern of the importance of 'trust' as his Champions League hopes rest in Pep Guardiola's hands on Wednesday night.

City need to win or earn a goalscoring draw away to Roma to progress to the Champions League knockout stages – the minimum requirement of Sheikh Mansour's ambitions for the club.

But even that won't be enough if Bayern, who have already qualified as group winners, lose at home to CSKA Moscow.

In that case Moscow would finish ahead of City if they finish level on points because of their better head-to-head record.

Although Bayern have a heavy injury list and crowded fixture programme, Pellegrini says he is not worried the Germans may see the value in fielding a weakened team that could knock City out of the competition early.

'I am not thinking about that. I think strong teams and big teams always try to win their games because it is important for the trust, important for the club,' said Pellegrini.

'Apart from winning in Rome, we must also now wait what happens about CSKA because if they win against Bayern, they will continue in the Champions League.

'So it doesn't depend on what we can do, but the only thing that we must do is to win. We must try to focus in our game.'

To add to the intrigue, Bayern have been enthusiastic backers of Uefa's financial fair play regulations. City were heavily fined and forced to pick a reduced 21-man Champions League squad for this season for breaking FPP regulations in the past.

There are various permutations that City will need to take into account on Wednesday.

If they are drawing 1-1 or 2-2 in Rome, the scoreline of the other game in Munich would dictate if City needed to score a winning goal to progress.

It’s a minefield, although Manchester City can qualify with a victory or a high scoring draw in Rome unless CSKA Moscow win in Munich, in which case the Russians would go through. City would go out with a 0-0 draw and there are many more permutations beyond those.

Even so, Pellegrini – criticised last season for not seeming to realise a 4-2 win against Bayern would help City top the group when he took off Sergio Aguero in the closing stages as City led 3-2 – insists he has not deployed anyone in particular to keep him abreast of developments in the other group game.

'I don’t think that it is complicated this year. I don't see where the complication is. We must win, we have nothing to think about,' he said.

'This team will not change. We will always be an offensive team, we will always try to go for the game from the beginning and we will do the same thing against Roma.

'We know if it is 0-0 that puts Roma in a better position than our team. If we draw 1-1 we are in a better position than Roma and both teams will depend on what happens with CSKA Moscow against Bayern. My mind is absolutely clear.'

While Pellegrini waits to see if playmaker David Silva is fit enough for his first action since being injured in a Capital One Cup tie against Newcastle, he is also aware of the danger of Roma's 38-year-icon Francesco Totti.

Totti embarrassed City's twitter feed at The Etihad Stadium by scoring Roma's goal in a 1-1 draw after they had highlighted before the game that he hadn't got a goal on English soil.

Pellegrini, who was appointed after Roberto Mancini had failed to get City past the group stages in Europe, said Tottie remains a threat.

'He is the same as Frank Lampard,' said the City boss. 'They have enough quality – maybe not to play three games in a week – but when they play they are very good.'

Pellegrini reached the Champions League quarter-finals with unfancied Malaga two seasons ago. Last year, City crashed out at the last-16 stage against Barcelona.
