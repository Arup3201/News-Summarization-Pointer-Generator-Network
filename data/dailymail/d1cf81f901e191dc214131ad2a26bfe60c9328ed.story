Britain's cancer shame was exposed last night as a major report showed our survival rates are still no better than Eastern Europe

Britain's cancer shame was exposed last night as a major report showed our survival rates are still no better than Eastern Europe.

Women with cervical cancer in the UK are less likely to be alive after five years than their counterparts in Slovenia and the Czech Republic, a major international study found.

Our survival rates for breast and bowel cancer are also among the worst of the world’s industrialised nations, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation Development.

Its report found that even Russia has a lower mortality rate for cancers than the UK – and that the NHS has fewer MRI scans to detect cancers and other illnesses than almost any wealthy nation.

And despite Labour’s extra millions, far fewer women are being screened now for breast and bowel cancer than a decade ago.

Last night a cancer expert described Britain’s position in the cancer league tables as a ‘tragedy’. The study shows that the UK is also at Eastern European levels on stroke survival – worse than the Czech Republic.

All these factors add up to make Britons’  life expectancy at birth among the lowest in Western Europe, and for women it is even lower than Slovenia.

Professor Karol Sikora, former chief of the World Health Organisation’s cancer programme, said last night: ‘We are improving but at nothing like the rate of the rest of Europe – we are not catching up at all. 

‘In Britain there are lots of delays in the system. We need to speed up the whole process.

‘In France, when there is a concern the blood tests, the scans and so forth would all be done  in a week – here you might still be trying to get an appointment with your GP.

'A lot of this is about late diagnosis – GPs missing cancer or patients not being seen quickly enough once they are referred.

‘It is a really sad indictment of the priority we give to cancer … If we just met the average of the rest of the European league tables we could save 10,000 lives a year.’ 

The OECD report is the most comprehensive analysis of health spending and outcomes across richer nations. While there is some good news for Britons – our suicide rate is one of the lowest and only Sweden has fewer road fatalities – most of it makes grim reading.

Ciarán Devane, of Macmillan Cancer Care, said: ‘It is simply unacceptable that cancer survival rates in the UK continue to lag behind those in the rest of Europe, and these latest figures are very disappointing.

'Clearly more needs to be done to encourage better screening attendance and early diagnosis.’
