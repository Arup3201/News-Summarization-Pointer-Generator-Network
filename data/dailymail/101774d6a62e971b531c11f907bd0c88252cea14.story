They may be one of the ugliest animals on the planet, but naked mole rats may hold the key to finding new ways to protect people from developing cancer.

Scientists have discovered a new protein that appears to be responsible for giving the hairless subterranean rodents their remarkable resistance against cancer.

The short-sighted creatures, which are more closely related to porcupines than rats, have never been seen to develop cancer despite living for up to 32 years.

Researchers have found that the creatures have a cluster of genes that produce four proteins responsible for preventing damaged cells that might cause cancer from multiplying and so prevent tumours from growing.

With wrinkly skin and walrus like teeth, naked mole rats are never going to win any beauty contests.

Yet these creatures, which live underground in the deserts of east Africa, are one the medical marvels of the natural world.

If a human was to have the same lifespan as a naked mole rat, relative to its size, they would live for up to 600 years.

As well as being resistant to cancer, they have very low respiratory and metabolic rates, meaning they use oxygen sparingly.

Scientists have put considerable effort into sequencing the creatures' genome in an attempt to understand its secrets. 

The machinery that translates their DNA into the functioning molecules in the cells, proteins, have also been found to be highly accurate.

This means their proteins contain few errors compared to other mammals, and meaning their is less chance of something malfunctioning.

Humans and mice, which both develop cancers, are known to have the same cluster of genes, but they produce just three proteins from it.

The scientists found the fourth protein in mole rats is formed by the fusion of two of the other proteins to form a 'super protein' that is much better at stopping cancer from forming.

The researchers hope it may now be possible to use this newly discovered protein to develop new treatments that can help stop cancers from spreading or even developing in the first place.

Professor Vera Gorbunova, a biologist who helped to lead the study at the University of Rochester, in New York, said: 'While our work doesn't eliminate the possibility that the protein exists under some conditions in mice and humans, the results suggest that it's highly unlikely.

'The better we understand that gene and control its mutations, the better our chances of controlling some cancers.'

Naked mole rats are one of only two species of mammal that are known to live in social colonies in the service of a single breeding queen.

The creatures are the only mammal unable to regulate their own body temperature but also do not feel pain from acid or chilli peppers.

The animals are also remarkably long lived compared to other rodents - mice have a lifespan of just a few years, for example.

Tumors form when cells malfunction leading to uncontrolled growth, like in the colon cancer cells above

Prevoiusly scientists found that a molecule that endows the naked mole rate with its spingy wrinkled skin also plays a role in preventing the spread of tumours.

A sugar called hyaluronic acid oozes from cells in the creature's connective tissue and forms cages around the cells to prevent them from replicating unchecked, as happens in tumours.

Professor Gorbunova and her colleague Professor Andrei Seluanov have in the past found that this sugar activates the cluster of anti-cancer genes called INK4.

It is this cluster that they have now studied in more detail in their latest work, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and found that it produces three proteins also found in humans - p16INK4a, p15INK4b and ARF.

However, in naked mole rats a fourth protein forms that is a hybrid of two of the others that they have called pALTINK4a/b.

Professor Gorbunova said: 'We believe it may contribute to the longevity of the naked mole rat, including its ability to prevent tumours from developing.'

The researchers found that the new hybrid protein appears to increase when cells become crowded together when hyaluronic acid is present, making naked mole rats more likely to arrest the growth of cells if they are at risk of becoming malignant.

They also found that the hybrid protein also has the potential to prevent the uncontrolled cell growth in human cells too.

The scientists hope that it may be possible to use this protein to develop new types of drugs that can be used to control the growth of cancers in patients.

Professor Seluanov said: 'INK4 is the most commonly mutated gene locus in the human cancer.

'When that gene is deleted or silenced, it often results in the formation of tumors.

'Understanding the regulation of the INK4 locus is critical for cancer and aging research.'
